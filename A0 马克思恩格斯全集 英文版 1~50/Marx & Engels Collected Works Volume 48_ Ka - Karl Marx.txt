FREDERICK ENGELS 
LETTERS 
January 1887-July 1890 

=====第12页=====
PREFACE 
Volume 48 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels contains Engels' 
letters dated from January 1887 to July 1890. 
It contains letters to participants in the working-class and socialist 
movement in many parts of the world, though the main focus is on 
Britain, France, Germany and the United States. In Germany Engels 
documents the struggles of the Social Democrats against the Anti-
Socialist Law, and their increasing success in the Reichstag elections. He 
also welcomes to Britain the producers of the Sozialdemokrat, exiled 
from Zurich. In France he urges the Socialists to organise a proper daily 
paper, to be less fractious in their dealings with the international move­
ment and to make more effort to communicate with other parties. In 
England he castigates the old-style trade unions and warmly welcomes 
the development of the new unions - a development in which Eleanor 
Marx played a major role. He is fairly dismissive of the SDF and Socialist 
League, seeing the new unionism as likely to produce new leaders for the 
socialist movement. Many of Engels' letters to the US concern a dispute 
over money between Edward Aveling and the Socialist Labour Party, in 
which Engels loyally takes the part of Aveling. Engels takes the view that 
the official socialist parties in both the US and Britain will be swept aside 
as the working class develops its own organisations. In summer 1888 
Engels visited the US and he writes interestingly of what he observes. 
Many letters in this volume concern the two 1889 International Paris 
Congresses organised by The Workers Party of France and the 
Possibilists. Engels comments trenchantly on the competing strands 
within the French and international movement. Following on from the 
success of the Worker's Party conference, an international celebration of 
Mayday was organised for the following year in many European coun­
tries,  which Engels also documents. These events were the beginnings of 
the Second International. 
Other letters contain information about Engels' work in carrying on the 
editing of Marx's writings, especially Capital Volume 2. Engels writes of 
1

2 Preface 
the difficulties of reading Marx's writing and hits on the idea of training 
others to decipher it. Engels also corresponds with his US publishers about 
his own work, particularly the American edition of the Condition of the 
Working Class in Britain. Other letters concern other publishing, translat­
ing and revising projects, of work by both Marx and Engels. On many 
occasions Engels bemoans the fact that his involvement in the shenanigans 
and intrigues of the socialist and working class movement keep him from 
his scholarly work - as do his increasing problems with his eyes. 
A recurring theme in the letters is Engels' fear that rivalry between 
the great European powers will bring war, which will destroy the 
nascent socialist movement. He also comments on Bismarck's relations 
with three generations of German emperors - both William I and 
Frederick III died in 1888, to be succeeded by William II, of whom 
Engels had a very low opinion. He is critical of both German and French 
nationalism, and is critical in particular of the Boulangist current in the 
French workers' movement, which he see as part of the recurring French 
problem of Bonapartism. 
These letters also show the personal side of Engels' life, particularly 
in his letters to Laura Lafargue. We hear of visits from Eleanor Marx, 
'Pumps' Rosher (Engels' niece by marriage) Schorlemmer, and many 
others, and of holidays and celebrations. His affection for Helen 
Demuth (Nim) shines through, as does his fondness for all his (largely 
adopted) family, especially Marx's daughters. Although Engels could be 
a formidable opponent he was clearly a very good friend. 
This volume was largely edited by Progress Publishers in Russia but, due 
to the changing fortunes of that company, the work has been finished in 
the UK by Lawrence and Wishart. This accounts for some of the slight 
differences in format. We have made every effort - with slightly less 
resources than the old Progress Publishers - to keep to the high stan­
dards of previous volumes, and hope readers will bear with us as we 
complete the last volumes of the Collected Works. 
The translations for this volume were made by Peter and Betty Ross, 
Rodney Livingstone, K. M. Cook and Stephen Smith.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGEi 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 11 January 1887 
Herewith, registered, the English translation of Das Kapital.* 2 Last week 
I sent you 1 parcel—2 Commonweals, 1 To-Day, etc. More to follow. 
Just received the New York Herald with the beastly article about the 
Avelings; this is most valuable for us since the Avelings would otherwise 
have still been unaware of the pack of lies the bourgeois papers over 
there are making up about them. 3 The Avelings got back a week ago. 
both of them very well and cheerful. The Lafargues are also here and 
send you their kindest regards. Capital is going terrifically well here and 
supplies for America are in hand. That will soon show the Yankees what 
our standpoint is.

I see from the newspapers that the Court of Appeal has upheld your 
conviction. So no doubt you will shortly have to make your way to 
gaol.5 I cannot let you go without taking my leave of you and assuring 
you that all my sympathy will go with you when you enter your cell, 
and that I hope you will return to us from your solitary confinement 
sound in body and unbroken in spirit to resume your activities. Please 
let me know whether it will be possible to communicate with you while 
you are in gaol, either by letter or by sending printed matter, and 
whether you are allowed books and to engage in literary work. 
The Lafargues from Paris have been over here since Christmas, and 
a week ago the Avelings returned from America, bringing back a great 
deal of encouraging news.3 The movement over there is forging ahead 
in fine style and nothing can stop it. From its inevitably muddled begin­
nings it has evolved with amazing speed into a political labour party. 
True,  the programme—or rather the various programmes in New York, 
Chicago, etc.—are still far from clear, as is only to be expected. But the 
action is all that it should be and that is the main thing. When I consider 
how long it took the workers in France, Belgium, Spain, etc., to under­
stand that a political organisation of the working class, separate from, 
and opposed to all other parties, could alone lead them to victory, one 
must admire the action of the Americans who, six months after the birth 
of the movement, are operating an organised party, have received 68,000 
votes in New York6 and won important victories in the elections in the 
West.7  But once the proletariat of a country has organised itself as a 
militant party, it will itself be driven onwards by the ups and downs of 
the battle, knowing as it does the conditions of its emancipation. And 
particularly for so eminently practical and anti-theoretical a people as 
the Americans, there is no other way to understanding than by trial and 
error, by acquiring wisdom from the consequences of their own 
mistakes. And that is something they will experience and master soon 
enough.

In other respects, too, the movement is progressing splendidly every­
where and I trust that when you get out of gaol you will find we have 
made a big step forward. All that can prevent us doing so is a European 
war, which would set us back enormously for a short while but which, 
like any other event, would turn out to our advantage in the end. 
The English translation of Das Kapital* 2 has just come out, and at 
precisely the right moment for America. 
And now, once again good-bye. The best wishes of us all will accom­
pany you into your solitude. I hope we shall see one another again in 
London in a year's time. 
With kindest regards from the Lafargues, the Avelings and

Caro Cittadino,h 
Your letter of the 9th of this month8 was not altogether unexpected, 
since I knew that you were a government official and that sooner or later 
this would make your position untenable. Unfortunately I cannot hold 
out any favourable prospects for you either here or in America. If you 
don't speak fluent English, it will be impossible for you to find a remu­
nerative occupation in either country unless you become adept in the 
colloquial use of the language. For educated people the usual, virtually

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI 
IN BENEVENTO 
London, 26 January 1887 
Dear Citizen, 
I wrote to you on the 18th of this monthb in reply to your kind letter 
of the 9th8 and afterwards I received yours of the 21st. 
I can only confirm what I said in my last letter: neither here in 
England nor in the United States of North America is it possible for 
someone who does not speak English to earn a living other than by 
manual work. 
The Argentine Republic would perhaps provide more favourable 
hunting ground; there is a strong Italian colony and you would learn 
Spanish without much difficulty. But it is a long way away, the voyage 
would be costly, and it would be difficult to come back. The country is 
progressing, but that is all I really know. Not being familiar with 
Argentinian legislation, I do not know under what conditions one can 
live there from teaching in an elementary school. 
As for commerce. I have been out of it for 18 years and I no longer 
have any relations with commercial firms or factories.9 What is more, in 
some cases a reference from me would be worse than none at all (if one 
could find a firm whose partners still know me) because people know 
me not so much as a businessman of the past than as an active socialist

of the present. And then there is the fact that all the big cities are 
swarming with commercial dealers not suspected of socialism who are 
looking for work and who are preferred because of their commercial 
education. I have for long considered whether it might not be possible 
to find some way out of this from here, but I cannot see one. 
I am writing to Vienna (Austria) and Hamburg to try and find some­
thing, though without much hope. But we can only try, and I shall let 
you know the outcome. 
You would do well to write to Lafargue too. He was here when your 
letter of the 9th arrived and was informed of its contents. He said he 
feared there was no hope of his finding a job for you in Paris; but when 
he is back among his friends he might get more information and change 
his mind. I shall write to him at the same time on your  behalf. a 
The great problem is that we socialists are not only politically but also 
civilly proscribed, and for the entire bourgeoisie it is both a pleasure and 
a duty to see that we starve. This anathema falls principally upon educated 
and cultured men, whom they consider to be deserters from their own 
class that have passed over to the enemy camp. This problem presents 
itself everywhere; we faced it ourselves in 1844 and 1849. How many 
times did Marx and I not wish that we knew some manual trade, for even 
the bourgeois cannot live without the products of manual labour! 
Would it not be possible for you to find work with one of the Italian 
socialist newspapers, in Milan or elsewhere? I do not receive them, and 
I am therefore not well informed of the present state of the socialist 
party in your country. In any case it would be preferable if you could 
remain in Italy. 
I repeat that I shall be pleased to do everything in my power to find 
a way out of the difficulties you are caught up in. I only regret I cannot 
open better vistas. I shall not forget what you have done to make our 
ideas and my writings known in Italy, and rest assured that, if something 
comes up for you somewhere, I shall not let it escape me. 
With sincere greetings, 
F. Engels

ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY 10 
IN NEW YORK 
[London,] 27 January 1887 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
Herewith I send you, at last, the Preface.11'12 No sooner had the 
Avelings returned3 when I was seized with a slight conjunctivitis which 
was however sufficient to prevent all regular work especially as the short 
time I could each day devote to writing was unavoidably taken up by 
urgent correspondence. Although my eye is not yet quite free from 
inflammation, yet I have managed to get through the Preface and hope 
the delay will not have inconvenienced you too much. 
As I have not been able to keep a copy I must request you to return 
me the MS when done with. I suppose you will be good enongh to see it 
through the press. 
I hope Dr Wischnewetzky has arrived safe after a good passage. I 
regret that I could not have him all to myself for a couple of hours, but 
he just dropped in at an evening when, for the time being, the old 
'International' was made to undergo a practical revival. 
The movement in America, just at this moment, is I believe best seen 
from across the ocean. On the spot, personal bickering and local 
disputes must obscure much of the grandeur of it. And the only thing 
that could really delay its march, would be the consolidation of these 
differences into established sects. To some extent, that will be unavoid­
able,  but the less of it the better. And the Germans have most to guard 
against this. Our theory is a theory of evolution, not a dogma to be 
learnt by heart and to be repeated mechanically. Je weniger sie den 
Amerikanern von Aussen eingepaukt wird und je mehr  sie sie  durch eigne 
Erfahrung —unter dem Beistand der Deutschen —erproben, desto tiefer 
geht sie ihnen in Fleisch und Blut  Über.*  When we returned to Germany 
in spring 1848, we joined the Democratic Party as the only possible 
a The less it is drummed into the Americans from outside and the more thor­
oughly they test it—with Germans' assistance—by personal experience, the 
more deeply will it penetrate their flesh and blood

means of gaining the ear of the working class; we were the most 
advanced wing of that party, but still a wing of it. When Marx founded 
the International, he drew up the General Rulesb in such a way that all 
working-class socialists of that period could join it—Proudhonists, 
Pierre-Lerouxists, and even the more advanced section of the English 
Trades Unions; and it was only through this latitude that the 
International became what it was, the means of gradually dissolving 
and absorbing all these minor sects, with the exception of the 
Anarchists whose sudden appearance in various countries was but the 
effect of the violent bourgeois reaction after the Commune and could 
therefore safely be left by us to die out of  itself,  as it did. Had we from 
1864-73 insisted on working together only with those who openly 
adopted our platform—Where should we be to-day? I think all our 
practice has shown that it is possible to work along with the general 
movement of the working class at every one of its stages without giving 
up or hiding our own distinct position and even organization, and I am 
afraid that if the German Americans choose a different line they will 
commit a great mistake. 
I hope you are by this time perfectly restored to health and that your 
husband and children are well too. Kind regards to Dr Wischnewetzky. 
Very truly yours

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 13 
IN PARIS 
London, 28 January 1887 
My dear Lafargue, 
My eye is at last getting slightly better, but not yet well enough to 
enable me to shift the mountain of work and correspondence that has 
accumulated in the meantime. I can only write by daylight and then not 
all the time, but I am at least able to read for the better part of the evening. 
If the Parisians are beginning to feel bellicose just now, they would 
be better advised to direct their wrath against Russia, which has used 
them to pull her chestnuts out of the fire and, now that they've burnt 
their fingers, is abandoning them to their fate. Can they not see that it 
is Russia which, through the Paris papers in her pay (the most 
dissolute being, it seems, the Débats 3-), has incited their revanchist 
rodomontade with the sole aim of getting Bismarck to capitulate to 
the Tsar b? And now she has got what she wanted; Bismarck has made 
his peace with Russia and has sacrificed Austria, while Russia has 
sacrificed her Parisian dupes to Bismarck.14 The Russian alliance has 
its points! 
Come to that, I do not believe that Bismarck wants a war which, no 
sooner begun, would become European. Once France and Germany had 
got to grips—and it would be a hard struggle and rather long—the Tsar 
would be compelled, willy-nilly, to march on the Balkans: 
Austro-Russian war. From that moment on, Bismarck would be at the 
mercy of unforeseeable circumstances, and I don't suppose he is so 
stupid to provoke such a situation in cold blood. But the Russian agency 
in Paris will continue its activities; it is in the interests of Russia to get 
France and Germany embroiled in a war; then she would have no one 
left to fight except Austria and, at most, England which would mean, in 
the opinion of the Russian chauvinists, who despise both England and 
Austria, a free hand for Russia in the East. And there lies the danger. If 
those gentry, Cyon & Co., succeed in pushing France into this war, they

will be cutting each other's throats for the benefit of the Tsar and the 
perpetuation of despotism in Russia. 
As to the elections in Germany, our prospects are first-rate. I think we 
shall get 700,000 votes in all, maybe even more.15 But when it comes to 
the majority in the new Reichstag, you have to reckon with the German 
philistine, and he's no angel, far from it. 
Here it is being said that the Daily News' scoop was a scoop for 
Baring on the Stock Exchange. To Bismarck it must have seemed a most 
unpleasant manoeuvre, making a hash as it did of his electoral manoeu­
vres.  He has been forced to issue a démenti. 16 
Martignetti has again written to me.a It seems that he in at his wits' 
end and he asks me to find some way out for him, putting forward the 
most impossible suggestions. I have written to Hamburg and Vienna 
on his behalf and have also promised him I would write to you. No 
doubt you will hear from him direct. There's nothing for him either 
here or in America, since he does not speak a word of English. Might 
there be some opening for him in France, as a teacher of Italian? As I 
see it, there is nothing else he could do. Or can you think of some­
thing better? He is about to be dismissed from his post. Do try and 
find some opening for the poor devil, either in Paris or in the 
provinces. 
Pumps is a great deal better and her only serious complaint is 
intercostal rheumatism. When I saw her this morning she was quite 
cheerful. 
Nothing's going on here among Socialists but inter-clique intrigue. 
According to Scheu, Champion is sick of Hyndman and would like 
to topple him, which accounts for his rapprochement with Bax. He 
ran into Aveling the other day and was as friendly as could be. We 
shall see how it all ends. In the meantime Aveling is going to hold up 
before the East End working men the example set by the 
Americans—that of a labour movement which is independent of the 
older parties, this being a method of agitation that may well be effec­
tive. Last week he spoke at a meeting in Farringdon Street, as did 
Tussy the day before yesterday, and this they will continue to do 
both there and elsewhere. 
As soon as I have any time to spare I shall write to Laura. Meanwhile 
Nim would like to know if she has spoken to Longuet yet, and what his 
answer was.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 17 
PARIS 
London, 2 February 1887 
My dear Laura, 
I had finished Bel Amp on Monday0  night and was ruminating over 
the picture of Parisian journalism exhibited in it, thinking it must be 
exaggerated when lo—on Tuesday morning your letter and Paul's unroll 
to me a scene—from life—of Bel Ami, and so I must take off my hat to 
Guy de Maupassant. Well, this will do. Faut-il donc être canaille pour 
avoir un journal quotidien à  Parisf d'ls 
This is now the second time that our friends have made a daily paper— 
for others. And this time worse than the first. Lissagaray was a free 
lance, acting on his own hook for his own advancement, and might be 
left to die his own political death. But here the Possibilists19 step into the

bed ready made for them; not only do they get a daily of their own but 
they get it through a victory over us. And as the Cri is bought for the 
cancans, the scandale and the feuilletons only, and the public which 
decide on its success or otherwise only take in the leaders because they 
are not compelled to read then, the high-falutin of Pyat, the dead dull­
ness of Labusquière, the arrant and arrogant ignorance of Marouck will 
pass muster quite as much as the leaders of Guesde. Guebhard will still 
be paid in hard cash for his comes* and Séverine and Labruyère auront 
toujours de quoi  se payer de bons déjeuners. b 
As to the Voie du Peuple —horrible dodging title!—I suppose it will 
go the way of the Citoyen after the coup d'état, and disappear after a few 
spasmodic efforts. 20 If there was any hope of a man with 100,000 fr., that 
should have been turned to account in time; now when our people arrive 
defeated and turned out of doors, I am afraid that individual will be still 
harder to find. 
The lesson to be drawn from this is the same as before, that a weekly 
organ which belongs to us is worth ten times as much as a daily one 
which we make for others, to be kicked out when it suits them and to 
make room for M. Brousse & Co. And this seems now to be the estab­
lished function of our people in the daily press, and no doubt it will be 
repeated for a third time and exactly with the same results. Anyhow I 
hope that our ex-grands hommes 0 from the grand journal will now 
condescend to pay a little more attention to the Socialiste which is after 
all their refuge during the entr'actes of their grand political drama. 
I have given Nim your message, she thanks you very much and 
remains on the tiptoe of expectation, as the penny-a-liner used to say 30 
years ago. 
Tell Paul that I had already rummaged in my head the advisability of 
reducing the strength of my eye lotion, and after his letter, have doubled 
the quantity of water contained in it which seems to answer very well. I 
shall also use his hot water application and expect that between the two 
my remnant of conjunctivitis will disappear. 
Edward was to lecture again to-night at Farringdon Hall (for the 
Clerkenwell Branch of the League21) on his American tour. He and 
Tussy have had there two crowded nights on Wednesdays. But he has 
got a sore throat, and maybe Tussy will have to replace him. He intended

How it will be now I do not know. He has already been invited by one 
Radical East Club22 to lecture there. 
The Cri affair will finally decide Hyndman & Co, if ever they were 
undecided with regard to the support to give to the Possibilists. 
Séverine's blagues* about attempts to kick out all other factions will be 
explained as the usual intolerance of the Marxists and no doubt the 
whole will be traced back to 'the hand that broke up the International', 
by which they mean, taking Eccarius' word for it, your humble servant. 
That is a thing which cannot be helped and is utterly indifferent to me. 
But it has been always our fate—and now our Paris friends share it—that 
the more we show that we are ready to work together with honest and 
sincere people so long as they stand on a truly working men's platform— 
no matter how imperfect—the rogues and adventurers whose company 
we decline denounce us as intolerant, domineering and exclusive. I hope 
that our Paris friends will have occasion to convince themselves that 
Brousse is no worse than Hyndman. Both have united round themselves 
all candidates they could lay hands upon. 
Pumps is a deal better but—apart from the special troubles she has 
gone through—her stomach is much out of order and she suffers from 
sleeplessness. Nevertheless she is much more cheerful, she was on the 
sofa yesterday and this morning. 
Fortin writes to say that he is quite agreeable to our plan and will send 
you the 2 last chapters of the 18th Brumaire. 2i He sends me a resolution 
they have passed, on the war question. When the style of commercial 
letter-writing becomes ampoulé^ it is something terrible.

the old Roshers—send their love, and I ditto.

ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY 10 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 9 February 1887 
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
I reply at once to your letter, postmark 28th January. The preface11 
was sent on January 27th, and to your telegram received Sunday, 
February 6th, I replied immediately per cable: 'Sent registered 27th 
January'. 
As to the distorted passage from my letter which the irrepressible 
Baton could not refrain from publishing, it is no use for Rosenberg and 
Co. to saddle Aveling with it. The passage about the 100,000's and the 
millions occurred in my letter to youa and in no other letter. So you will 
know who is responsible for this indiscretion and for putting this 
nonsense into my mouth. As far as I am concerned, I have no objection 
to your publishing the whole passage, indeed the whole letter. 
Your fear as to my being unduly influenced by Aveling in my view of 
the American movement, is groundless. As soon as there was a national 
American working-class movement, independent of the Germans, my 
standpoint was clearly indicated by the facts of the case. That great 
national movement, no matter what its first form, is the real starting 
a See Engels' letter to Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky of 28 December 1886 
(present edition, Vol. 47)

16 Letters- 1887 
point of American working-class development; if the Germans join it 
in order to help it or to hasten its development in the right direction, 
they may do a deal of good and play a decisive part in it; if they stand 
aloof,  they will dwindle down into a dogmatic sect, and be brushed 
aside as people who do not understand their own principles. Mrs 
Aveling, who has seen her father at work, understood this quite as well 
from the beginning, and if Aveling saw it too, all the better. And all my 
letters to America, to Sorge, to yourself,  to the Avelings, from the very 
beginning, have repeated this view over and over again. a Still I was glad 
to see the Avelings before writing my preface, because they gave me 
some new facts about the inner mysteries of the German party in New 
York. 
You appear to take it for granted that Aveling has behaved in America 
simply as a swindler; and not only that; you call upon me, upon the 
strength of the assertions and allusions contained in your letter, to treat 
him as such and to do all in my power to have him excluded from the 
literary organs of the party.24 Now for all these assertions you cannot 
have any proof because you have not been able to hear any defence. Still 
you are better off than we here; you have at least heard one side, while 
we do not even know what the distinct charge is! 
In the early hole-and-corner stages of the working-class movement, 
when the working men are still under the influence of traditional preju­
dices,  woe be to the man who, being of bourgeois origin or superior 
education, goes into the movement and in rash enough to enter into 
money relations with the working-class element. There is sure to be a 
dispute upon the cash accounts and this is at once enlarged into an 
attempt at exploitation. Especially so, if the 'bourgeois' happens to have 
views on theoretical or tactical points that disagree with those of the 
majority or even of a minority. This I have constantly seen for more than 
forty years. The worst of all were the Germans; in Germany, the growth 
of the movement has long since swept that failing away, but it has not 
died out with the Germans out of Germany. For that reason Marx and I 
have always tried to avoid having any money dealings with the party, no 
matter in what country. And when the Avelings went to America, I had 
very strong misgivings on that point. Only when it was arranged that the 
tour should be made together with Liebknecht I felt more at rest, 
a See Engels' letters to F. A. Sorge of 29 November 1886 and Florence Kelley-
Wischnewetzky of 28 December 1886 (present edition, Vol. 47) and also his 
letter to her of  27 January 1817 (this volume) 

=====第28页=====
Letters -1887 17 
because Liebknecht, as an old hand, would know how to deal with such 
complaints, and because any charges brought against him on that score 
would merely make the complainants ridiculous in Germany and in 
Europe generally. Well, the tour was arranged differently afterwards, and 
here is the result. 
From this you will see that I look upon this matter a great deal cooler 
than what people seem to do in New York. But moreover, I have known 
Aveling for four years; I know that he has twice sacrificed his social and 
economical position to his convictions, and might be, had he refrained 
from doing so, a professor in an English university and a distinguished 
physiologist instead of an overworked journalist with a very uncertain 
income. I have had occasion to observe his capacities by working with 
him, and his character by seeing him pass through rather trying circum­
stances more than once, and it will take a good deal more than mere 
assertions and innuendos before I believe what some people tell about 
him now in New York. 
But then. Had he tried to swindle the party, how could he do that 
during all his tour without his wife being cognisant of it? And in that 
case the charge includes her too. And then it becomes utterly absurd, in 
my eyes at least. Her I have known from a child, and for the last seven­
teen years she has been constantly about me. And more than that, I have 
inherited from Marx the obligation to stand by his children as he would 
have done  himself,  and to see, far as lies in my power, that they are not 
wronged. And that I shall do, in spite of fifty Executives. The daughter 
of Marx swindling the working class—too rich indeed! 
Then you say: 'No one here imagines that Dr Aveling put the money 
in his pocket, or spent it as the bills indicate. They believe that he merely 
tried to cover his wife's expenses,'—That is a distinct charge of forgery, 
and this you give as an extenuating, charitable supposition. What then, if 
this be the attenuated charge, what is the full charge? And on what 
ground is this charge made? 'The ridiculous bills which Dr Aveling sent 
in.' I should like to see a few of these 'ridiculous' bills. For fifteen weeks 
they were sent every Sunday to the Executive who gave no sign of disap­
proval. Nor did they budge when the Avelings, December 19th, returned 
to New York. It was only on the 23rd when they were on the point of 
leaving, when they could no longer defend themselves against charges, 
real or trumped-up, that the Executive discovered these bills, to which, 
singly, they had never objected, were ridiculous when added up\ That is 
to say they object, not to the bills, but to the rules of addition. Why, 
then, did the Executive, instead of shortening the tour, try to extend it,

and just at the close of it plan a second visit of the Avelings to Chicago 
which fortunately did not come off? It strikes me that in all this, it is not 
the bills which are ridiculous, but the Executive. 
Well, at the meeting of December 23rd, the Avelings hear for the first 
time that their bills are ridiculous, and the Executive lay before them a 
statement of accounts drawn up by themselves. As soon as his statement 
is objected to, Aveling at once accepts that of the Executive, according to 
which—as I have seen myself in Rosenberg's handwriting—a balance is 
due to him of $176. Then, being again bullied by Walther, he refuses that 
balance, returns $76 at once, and sends the rest from London. And then 
you say that 'Dr Aveling returning the $100 has not helped matters at 
all.' Why what in the name of goodness do those people want then? Is 
Aveling to be treated as a swindler because the Executive appropriate 
$176 which, on their own showing, belong to him? 
Then the mystery with which the Executive envelops this matter, 
becomes darker and darker. When the article in the New York  Herald* 
appeared and was cabled across, the Avelings sent the enclosed circular 
to the sections, and, at the same time, to the Executive.2 ^ That circular— 
unless I take Aveling to be a liar and a swindler, which I decline doing 
until further conclusive evidence—is in my eyes conclusive against the 
Executive, at least until I see their reply. But what do the Executive do? 
They get infamous attacks into the Volkszeitung. 26 They spread rumours 
and reports behind Aveling's back, they call meetings of the sections and 
lay their version before them, and get them to vote resolutions in a 
matter which cannot be judged without an impartial audit of the whole 
accounts and a full defence of the absent accused. And having, as it 
appears, succeeded in their New York circle to slander Aveling, not as a 
man who has spent their money extravagantly (for such, rightly or 
wrongly, might be their honest conviction), but as a swindler and forger 
of accounts. They rise to the level of the occasion created by their own 
inventive genius, and promise a circular proclaiming Aveling a swindler 
and forger to the working-class of the whole world! And all this, mind 
you, behind the back of, and unknown to, the man whom they charge, 
and who can not only not defend  himself,  but not even make out the 
precise facts on which the charge is based! If this is the way people are 
to be judged in our party, then give me the Leipzig Reichsgericht 27 and 
the Chicago jury. 28

Fortunately we have passed that stage in the older parties in Europe. 
We have seen Executives rise and fall by the dozen, we know they are as 
fallible as any pope, and have even known more than one that lived 
sumptuously on the pence of the working-men, and had swindlers and 
forgers of accounts in its midst. In their circular, the Executive will not 
only have to define their charge - which perhaps will thus at last become 
known to us - but also to prove it. People on this side do not take the 
word of their own Executives for gospel, much less that of Mr Walter 
and Mr Rosenberg, be it ever so 'official'. 
In my opinion, the Executive have placed themselves in a very 
uncomfortable position. Had they grumbled at the accounts as merely 
extravagant, they might have secured a hearing outside their own circle; 
for that is more or less a matter of opinion. But having never objected 
to the accounts sent in, they felt they had cut the ground from under 
their feet, and, as weak people do under circumstances, exaggerated the 
charge in order to cover themselves. Thus they come to the fresh charge 
of swindling and forgery which they can never prove and must be 
content to insinuate. But an infamy insinuated to cover mere weakness, 
remains neither more nor less an infamy. And having swelled what was 
originally a mere trifling matter of disputed accounting into a criminal 
offence, they naturally feel bound to go before the various working-
class parties with it. And naturally, they do it in a sneaking underhand 
way, preventing the accused from even hearing the charge. One 
mistaken step leads to another, and at last they arrive in a complete mess 
and are caught in their own net. And all that not out of inborn malice, 
but sheer weakness. 
You will now see that I must most distinctly decline following your 
advice as to 'giving Kautsky a hint, not to let the letters appear which are 
advertised in the name of Dr Aveling', because the Executive are going 
to launch 'an official circular' against Aveling, and 'his name as one of 
the staff can only injure any organ'. Neither Kautsky nor myself have, I 
believe, ever given any grounds for anyone to suppose that we would 
treat thus the friends we have worked with for years, upon the strength 
of mere assertions and innuendos. And if I was to say anything of the 
kind to Kautsky, I should simply drive him to the conclusion that I was 
either falling rapidly into dotage, or that I was no longer to be trusted 
across the road. Indeed I feel certain you regretted having written this 
passage as soon as the letter had gone. 
I see very well that you wrote your letter in what you considered the 
interests of the party, and thus were led to represent to me the case of

Aveling as hopeless and judged without appeal. But so far he is judged 
by nobody but the Executive who are themselves parties, accusers, 
judges and jury all in one; for the resolution of the New York sections, 
whatever it may be counts for nothing. What the other sections may say 
remains to be seen, but even they, if impartial, can only declare them­
selves incompetent until they have the full facts and until the accused has 
been heard. And I for one consider it utterly ruinous to the party to 
introduce into it, and even to outdo, the kind of justice practiced by 
Bismarck and by the American bourgeois, who do at least respect forms 
and give the prisoner at the bar a hearing—and for us to act thus at the 
very moment we protest against these infamous proceedings. 
No doubt it may suit the Executive, under the pretence of avoiding 
public scandal, to shirk publicity. But that will not do. Either they must 
retract the dishonouring charge, reduce the case to its simple dimensions 
of a dispute about accounts, and settle that honourably and straightfor­
wardly; or they must come out publicly with the charge and have it 
fought out. There has already too much of it been allowed to leak out, 
and it cannot remain where it is; nor is Aveling the man to leave it there. 
And as I cannot allow the Avelings to be accused of infamies behind 
their back, it was my duty to communicate your letter to Mrs Aveling 
(he being too ill at present) and to read to her my reply. And if at any 
time circumstances should require the publication of this my letter, you 
are at liberty to publish it in full, while I reserve to myself the same right, 
of course without dragging in your name, unless other people should 
have done so previously.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 29 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 12 February 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
Got your letter of 30 January yesterday, and the day before yesterday 
sent off sundry items to you. More to follow in a few days' time. Capital 
in English11'2 is selling very well; the jackass of a publisher,b who had no 
idea what he had got hold of, is quite astonished. 
I trust your health is improving. Abstemiousness is something I, too, 
am obliged to observe; every day brings some little physical contretemps 
that cannot be ignored and interferes with one's customary devil-may-
care way of life. Well, that's something that can't be helped. 
When Lafargue was here at Christmas he promised me to send you 
the Socialiste regularly. Not until after his return did I get a few extra 
copies of the article Situation, etc. c It has opened the eyes of the French 
to the fact that, for them, war would mean the end of the Republic— 
unless, of course, circumstances were quite exceptionally favourable, so 
that it might provoke a European revolution, which, however, is wanted 
neither by the bourgeois, the petty bourgeois nor the peasants. No one 
had thought of this before and now everyone's saying it. I am now read­
ing the article in Romanian, in Revista Sociala, a muddle-headed publi­
cation, appearing in Jassy, and learning the language as I go along. 
The gentlemen of the Socialist Labor Party's Executive are behaving 
quite outrageously towards the Avelings.24  When, thanks to their indis­
cretion, if not at their instigation, the article appeared in the  Herald, 
another quite outrageous article, for which, at the moment, I can only 
hold Mr Douai responsible, appeared in the Volkszeitung. 16 The 
Avelings' reply to the calumny in the Herald was the enclosed circular, 
which was sent off from here on about  18 January to all sections and also 
to the Executive. 25 Well, on the 28th January the latter induced some­
one,"  whom I may not name for the present and whose identity you

must therefore guess, to write me an embarrassed letter in which it is 
stated as fact, indubitable fact, that Aveling had attempted to swindle 
them and that—or so their Christian charity led them to suppose—he 
had fiddled the accounts he submitted in order to cover his wife's hotel 
expenses (the party only paid Tussy's rail fares), nor did the return of the 
$176 alter the case, for that was in no way the point at issue, etc. Nothing 
but insinuations and not one solitary fact, not even a definite accusation. 
Then it goes on to say that a resolution had already been obtained from 
the New York sections and was to be endorsed by the remaining sections 
after which a circular denouncing Aveling would be issued to all the 
European parties. And I am requested to warn Kautsky against printing 
anything else by a blackguard like Aveling, who in to be chucked out of 
all the party organs! 
You can imagine what kind of reply I made to these base assertions. 
If I can find someone to copy out the letter, I shall send it to you for, 
having an inflamed eye, I cannot make a third copy. These people 
haven't the shadow of a pretext. For on 23 December, when Aveling first 
learnt in a letter from Rosenberg that the Executive proposed to query 
some of the items in his account, he at once replied to Rosenberg, send­
ing the following letter per special messenger: 
T cannot discuss money matters with the Party, and am ready to 
accept anything without discussion that the National Executive of the 
Socialist Labor Party thinks right!' 
And that was before he knew what they were going to say and how 
they would treat him! And then the chaps go and pocket the $176, 
which, by their own calculation, belongs to the Avelings, and declare, for 
that very reason, that not they, but Aveling, is a swindler! 
Well, we shall clear the matter up all right. But unfortunately we 
over here don't know anyone in New York save for yourself on whom 
we can rely, now that even the Volkszeitung has behaved so egre-
giously. I should be grateful if you could let us know how Shevich and 
the others are behaving and whether or not they have already 
succumbed to the lies of the Executive. Then we should at least know 
to whom we could turn in New York without having to bother you. 
But I can't help wondering how it is that those same New Yorkers 
who fulminate against the Chicago jury 28 should, in this instance, 
outdo the jury in turpitude, and pass judgment on people without even

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 
IN PARIS 
London, 16 February 1887 
My dear Lafargue, 
My congratulations to our friends on the occasion of the Vote's resus­
citation18; let us hope that this time its waya  will be a triumphal one. Such 
of the Cri as Laura has sent me to look at is deadly dull; not even 
Bismarck's German reptiles 30 are as capable of sending us to sleep on our 
feet. Let us hope that the Parisians will refuse to stomach such  LEADERS, 
even when spiced with gossip column and feuilletonist sauce. 
I have read Laura's letter about Lavrov to Tussy; she will attend to the 
matter, although her hands are very full just now.31 To begin with 
Aveling has been suffering from QUINSY (which he himself instantly 
diagnosed as diphtheria) and, as a patient, he is as intractable as Pumps. 
Furthermore, she has had no sleep for three or four nights and has had 
to concern herself with the affairs of him, Edward (a Roumanian 
construction into which my pen has lapsed thanks to my present preoc­
cupation with that language), so that she has not had time to run errands 
in connexion with Lavrov's books. And, on top of that, something else 
has happened. First, I got a long letter from la Wischnewetzky,b from 
a Voie du peuple, the full name of the paper, means 'the way of the people' -
b This refers to her letter to Engels of 28 January 1887

which I gather that the idiots on the Executive Committee of the Socialist 
Labor Party intend to bring an action of some sort against Aveling, whom 
they accuse of having tried to defraud the Party over his travelling 
expenses, that they intend to get the sections to pass resolutions against 
him and, afterwards, to denounce him as a swindler in a circular addressed 
to the working men's parties of Europe. She even had the cheek to suggest 
I tell Kautsky that he would be well-advised not to print anything further 
of Aveling's. And, withal, never the slightest suggestion that the accused 
might at least have a right to be heard! You can imagine what my reply 
was! a Well, what should arrive the day before yesterday but the 
Executive's first circular, full of ridiculous accusations against Aveling32 
and not very difficult to demolish. But there is no time to be lost; the 
American sections have got to send their votes to New York on 15 March; 
and the Executive has delayed sending the circular to this country so long 
that putting up a defence is virtually impossible. Aveling is in Hastings, 
whither he was sent by the doctor, and will be home on Friday. In the 
meantime we are sending out a circular announcing his intention of 
defending himself and asking that the vote be suspended until then. As 
soon as he returns we shall set to work on the defence. I enclose Aveling's 
first circular on this affair which is conclusive enough so far as fundamen­
tals are concerned. It would be useful to know whether the Executive has 
sent its circular to the Parti ouvrier 31 or to the Germans in Paris; in Zurich 
Kautsky has already taken what steps are necessary. But, with all this 
going on you will realise how exceedingly busy Tussy is. 
I no longer remember whether I wrote and told you that Fortin is satis­
fied with the arrangement with Laura in regard to his manuscript, 23 so all 
that remains to be done is to let Lavigne know that his manuscript is with 
you, and this I would ask you to do since I do not know whether his old 
address is still the right one and am therefore unable to write to him. 
I do not know whether you have seen Materialismul economical lui 
Karl Marx de Lafargue! 0 I have seen a notice of it in the Jassy Revista 
Sociala, of December, in which there is a translation of my Socialiste arti­
cle 0—pretty crude as it happens. Roumanian is a funny sort of language. 
Their term for 'to work' is 'lucrare' —in Latin to appropriate surplus value; 
the working man, on the other hand is ''muncitorul'', a word of Slav

origin of which the literal and etymological equivalent is the Russian 
moutchitel, meaning martyr. For rebellion they use the Slav word 
rascaole, that is to say, ecclesiastical schism (Russian raskolnik, schis­
matic, heretic). In fact, for a Latin language it is fairly difficult, since they 
maltreat Latin and Slav (from which many of their words and sounds are 
derived) with disarmingly impartial nonchalance. Bulgarian (a Bulgarian 
Journal has been sent to Kautsky) is much easier for anyone familiar 
with Russian or Serbian. 
Laura will have seen our reply to Professor Menger34 , in the February 
number of the Neue Zeit. 
From all that I have seen the French press is adopting an excellent 
attitude towards Bismarck's foolish provocations.14 The man's tempera­
ment is such that it's impossible to say whether he does or does not want 
war. But anything that forces upon him the necessity either of staying 
pacifically at home or of becoming an overt aggressor can only benefit 
ourselves. He has today reached the same stage with France as he had 
reached with Williama in May 1866, after paving the way for the 
Austrian war35 which the latter abhorred: 'I have succeeded in leading 
the old horse to water, but I cannot make him drink.' And if the French 
stand their ground Bismarck will be in the devil of a mess. He already 
hopes to attain a majority with the help of the people. The Popeb will 
have ensured his septennium (having voted him the new regiments for 
three years, they will let him have them for seven)36 but, if the majority 
in the Reichstag remains in opposition on all other issues, Bismarck will 
not get a farthing. In the meantime everyone is agreed that all parties in 
Germany have reason to fear electoral defeat save for the Socialists, who 
are certain to have a resounding victory. 
Zetkin has asked me to let him have a letter for the meeting of the 
19th. I shall send it you tomorrow. I don't know yet what to say.37 
Give Laura a kiss from me, 
Yours ever

ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 17 
IN ST PETERSBURG 
London, 19 February 1887 
Dear Sir, 
I was glad to receive your letter of 22/3rd of this month38 because I 
saw from it that the publisher1 instead of sending you a copy of the 
English Capital^ had merely forwarded a prospectus. There have been 
several of these irregularities which cause us all sorts of vexation and 
uncertainty as to what has been done. However I have at once forwarded 
to you per post a copy, registered, on February 12th, and hope you 
received it safely. I am glad to say the book sells uncommonly well. The 
high price for the first edition was an unavoidable evil, but as the book 
is stereotyped, a cheap edition at about one-third of the price of the first 
will be brought out after some time; at the present moment the high 
price in no great obstacle here, though it is so to a certain extent in 
America. 
I think you will be doing a good work in showing to the public of 
your country the application of our author's0 theory to their circum­
stances. But perhaps you had better wait, as you say, until the comple­
tion of his work. The chapter on the Rent of Land,d  although written 
before he had studied Russian economic conditions, and written without 
reference thereto, will still be very necessary to you. The 3rd volume will 
be taken in hand after clearing off some other accumulated work; with 
the exception of three Abschnitte, the greater part is almost ready for 
press. 
I thank you very much for the Fairy Tales of Scedrin which I shall 
take in hand as soon as ever possible; a slight conjunctivitis of the left eye 
prevents me reading it at present, as the Russian type very much strains 
my eyesight.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
IN PARIS 
London, 24 February 1887 
My dear Laura, 
The Révolution en Allemagne-Prise de Berlin 3-—does not exactly 
come off in the way depicted in the Way of the People. The Voie du 
peuple on the other side of the Vosges is not exactly along the Boulevards 
of beautiful Paris. Not to speak of their mistakes about seats lost and 
gained, etc., the success of our German friends lies in another direction 
than where they seek it. 41 First of all, we have so far lost seats and not 
gained any, but that, though a fact, counts for nothing. The decisive fact 
is that, while we are very slowly losing ground in the Saxon districts of 
hand-weaving (which is dying out) and which were our original strong­
holds,  we are gaining far more rapidly not only in the large towns but in 
all rural industrial districts. I have the exact figures of 43 districts with 
one deputy each, including Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Munich, Leipzig, 
Hanover, Magdeburg, Elberfeld, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Nürnberg, 
Stuttgart, Frankfurt etc, mostly large towns of course.

or 27 per cent on the votes of 1884, in 3 years; and these include 5 
districts in which we lost votes. In a day or two I shall have more data to 
extend my list which comprises all districts the figures of which I know. 
Berlin has come out splendidly and I begin to have some confidence in 
that otherwise ridiculous town. 
The pressure brought to bear on our people was tremendous. Not 
even public proclamation of their candidates was allowed. Every one 
who took a part in the election by distributing bulletins de vote 3- etc. was 
noted—which means expulsion in the numerous towns under state of 
siege. Wherever possible, the manufacturers conducted them to the poll 
and saw that they voted for Bismarck unless they wanted immediate 
discharge from work. And all this will be repeated and increased on the 
day of ballotage where we expect to secure most of our seats. 
Singer is the Lockroy 42—le premier élu de l'Allemagne. He had 
32,227 votes which no other member can boast of. Bebel is in for 
Hamburg, Liebknecht out for Offenbach 0; had he had 50 more votes, he 
would have been in the ballot at Bremen and then sure of election. But 
there are sure to be double elections so that he will not want the place 
whereon to rest his hind quarters.43 The exact number of ballots in 
which we are interested I do not know; 16 at the least. These we shall 
almost all carry, as far as I can see—and unless we are left in the lurch by 
the Centre44 or Progressists,45 which is quite on the cards. 
While ordinarily but 55 to 65% of the voters polled, this time the 
philistine came up in force; 85 to 90% of the number on the list. And this 
accounts for many defeats. 
I am extremely glad of the Alsatian vote.46 That will help us to get rid 
of these non-descripts—neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring—all 
the easier. 
In a day or two you will get a printed circular with Aveling's reply to 
the charges of the New York Executive.47 If this circular has not been 
sent to the German club in Paris, then it has not been sent to Paris at all.

they lived extravagantly on the pence of the working man. Fortunately 
we have a good reply. 
Tell Paul that his discovery about Oriental Circumcision* shares the 
fate of many of my discoveries in natural science viz. that it had been 
made before. I have read the same thing long ago in German books and 
should not wonder if it was already in old Creuzer's Symbolik^ 1 which is 
as old as the battle of Waterloo. 
Poor Edward had an awful shock about these ridiculous accusations, 
so soon after his quinsy. He is not over-endowed with power of resis­
tance to malady, and so this threw him back very much. He has been off

30 Letters -1887 
The Executive over there is going to the most amazing lengths to 
obtain approval for its puerile action against Aveling. You will see from 
Aveling's circular (no doubt you will also have had a look at that of the 
Executive) what they tried on with the sections. But since then, and 
without waiting for the sections' vote, they have handed over the whole 
business to the Board of Supervisors in the hope that the latter may get 
them out of the soup. Aveling, of course, is also taking it up with the 
Board of Supervisors, to which he is now sending all the documents, and 
we shall see how things turn out. 
The Executive is wisely confining itself to the age-old and, to German 
expatriates, eternally new story of squandering the workers' pence; so 
presumably the additional charges of attempted embezzlement, etc., are 
only being disseminated in private. No doubt you will find some oppor­
tunity of putting the circulars to use. 
We have good reason to be satisfied with the elections in Germany.15 
The increase in the number of votes is marvellous, especially consider­
ing how much pressure is being exerted not only by the government but 
also by the industrialists who, wherever feasible, presented the workers 
with the choice either of being dismissed or of voting compulsorily for 
a Bismarckian. I fear this will again be in evidence in the second ballot, 
the results of which are not yet known over here. The Pope3 is forbid­
ding Catholics to vote for us, the men of Progress45 voluntarily prefer a 
Bismarckian to a Socialist, while the industrialists exercise outright 
coercion—so if in these circumstances we capture one or two more 
seats it will be a victory truly won.50 But it's not the number of seats 
that matter, only the statistical demonstration of the party's irresistible 
growth. 
You suggest that our people have made fools of themselves in electing 
such men as Geiser, Frohme, Viereck, etc. There's no alternative. They 
have to take the candidates as and where they find them. That is a fate 
shared by all workers' parties in parliaments where there is no remuner­
ation. Nor does it matter. The chaps are under no illusion regarding their 
representatives; of this the best proof is the total defeat of the 'parlia­
mentary group' in its trial of strength with the Sozialdemokrat. 51 And 
the deputies are well aware of it; the gentlemen of the right wing know 
that, if they are still tolerated, it is only by reason of the Anti-Socialist 
Law 52 and that they will instantly be thrown out on the day the party

regains its freedom of movement. Even then, all will be by no means well 
with the representation but I think I'd rather see the party superior to its 
parliamentary heroes than the other way round. 
Nor need you worry about Liebknecht. They realise perfectly well 
what he's like in Germany. I have seldom known a man about whom the 
opinions of the most diverse people are so closely agreed as they are 
about Liebknecht. While he imagines he's got them all eating out of his 
hand, they are sizing him up quite critically. His incorrigible optimism, 
particularly about anything in which he himself has a hand, his firm 
belief that he is the life and soul of the movement, the chap who does 
everything and manages everything for the best and that it's only the 
other 'jackasses' who spoil things, his urge to create order everywhere 
and to cover up all contradictions by resolving them into commonplaces, 
his yearning for outward and momentary successes, even at the expense 
of enduring losses—all this is very well known. But our people also 
know that all these failings are only the obverse of most valuable quali­
ties and that without those foibles he simply could not achieve what he 
does in fact achieve. So long as he has Bebel at his side he won't perpe­
trate any serious blunders although he may cause a lot of unnecessary 
trouble and strife. And when it comes to parting from the philistines, he 
will defend them up to the very last, but at the crucial moment will be 
found in the right place. 
I hope that your health will improve with the coming of spring.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 53 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 10 March 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
Postcard of the 22nd and letter of the 25th of February received. You 
guessed rightly. It would have been useless to send a copy of the long 
letter, since the wording of the complaints in the Executive's circular is 
not only milder but differs materially, while everything else up till now 
has been private tittle-tattle. The way people in Europe view the affair is 
evident from Singer's reply to the circular sent him by Aveling.47 'It's the 
old story though it's a pity that the Avelings also have to suffer through 
it.'a I sent you 4 copies of this circular in English and 4 in German; no 
doubt you will have received them, as also my letter of about a week 
ago.b 
La Wischnewetzky is incapable of translating the Manifesto. Only 
one person can do that, namely Sam Moore, and he is working on it at 
this moment; I already have the first section in ms.54 In this connection, 
however, it should be remembered that the Manifesto, like virtually all 
the shorter items by Marx and  myself,  is still much too abstruse for 
America. The workers over there are only now entering the movement; 
they are still quite raw and, particularly as regards theory, tremendously 
backward, owing to their generally Anglo-Saxon and particularly 
American nature and upbringing—hence it is to practice that the lever 
must be directly applied and for this purpose entirely new literature is 
required. I have already suggested to la Wischnewetzky that she bring 
out separately a popular digest of the main points in Capital in the form 
of short pamphlets.0 Once the chaps are more or less on the right path, 
the Manifesto cannot fail to make an impact; just now the impact will 
only be felt by a few. 
Your remarks about Das Kapital in English have been passed on to 
a P. Singer's letter to Engels of 7 March 1887. - b See previous letter. - c  See

the publisher/-55 who came back with a very practical answer to the 
effect that a favourable article in the North American Review would be 
enough to create a demand for an American edition and, for that reason, 
he would like to skim the cream off first. As it is, the thing is selling very 
well in America too; another big bookseller besides Bordollo has been 
ordering away merrily,56 while sales over here have been so brisk that all 
but 50 copies of the first edition have been snapped up and the second— 
still at the same price—is printing. And this despite very little advertis­
ing and before any of the large papers mentioned it. The first serious 
review appeared in the Athenaeum of 5 March—very favourable.57 The 
rest will now follow suit and help us sell the second edition, after which 
the cheap edition can doubtless come out.58 
Irrespective of what the Socialist Labor Party3 may purport to be 
and however much it may take the credit for the successes achieved by 
the work of its predecessors, it is the only labour organisation in 
America which by and large stands on our basis, it is distributed in 
more than 70 sections over the whole of the North and West and as 
such, and only as such, have I recognised it. I have expressly stated that 
it is a party only in name.59 And I'm convinced that the gentlemen of 
the Executive were very disappointed by my prefaceb and would rather 
have done without it. After all, they themselves belong to the school of 
which I have said that it will ruin the party if it gains the upper hand. 
And they seem to be intent on doing so. Injustice here, Rosenberg has 
attacked the Knights of Labor on account of the longshoremen's 
strike60; though he may not be altogether wrong about individual facts, 
he shows insufficient awareness of the course the movement is taking, 
a course that will quickly destroy the party if these chaps remain in 
control. It is precisely the follies of the place-seeking leaders of the 
Knights of Labor and their inevitable conflicts with the Central Labor 
Unions61 in the big cities of the East that must provoke a crisis within 
the Knights of Labor and bring it to a head. But the blockhead doesn't 
see it. 
Over here the unemployed agitation by the Social Democratic 
Federation62 has also proved to be a complete flop; the church parade in 
St Paul's was a silly attempt to ape the Chartists and was likewise a 
flop,63  in short nothing has happened yet. Next autumn things may get

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
IN PARIS 
London, 10 March 1887 
My dear Laura, 
Pleasant news. The first edition of Capital* 500 copies, is sold with 
the exception of about 50 copies and the 2nd edition is in preparation. 
Nearly half the edition, as far as I can calculate, has gone to Americab 
and the 2nd edition will still find a good market there unless a piratical 
edition is brought out which however will not probably be undertaken 
before the success of the book in America is manifest and moreover it 
will take some time. As the clichés are there, the 2nd edition will soon be 
in the market, and on that we shall have 3/9 in every copy instead of 3/-
as on the first. It will again be a 30/- edition. 58 
We saw the article in the Athenaeum57 and Tussy will send you a 
copy. It is very fortunate that the press begins to speak of the book just 
a the English edition of  Vol.  I - b See previous letter

as the 1st edition is sold out, and the Athenaeum article is worth a good 
deal to us. The gentlemen of the press evidently did not know exactly 
how to speak of the book, hence the delay, but now the Athenaeum has 
given them the key-note, the others are sure to follow suit. 
Between the above and what follows lies a long-winded visit from old 
Jakins the house agent who took the rent and payment for coals and two 
glasses of gin and a cigar—a repeated ringing of the dinner-bell to drive 
the old fellow away—successful at the third repetition—then a rather 
heavy dinner with Nim's potato-cakes as a wind-up, and so I am wound 
up, but not for letter-writing. I think you will not be sorry if under these 
circumstances I make no further attempt, but proceed at once to 
subscribe  myself.

ENGELS TO JULIE BEBEL

Dear Mrs Bebel, 
I am taking'the liberty of writing to you today in the hope that you 
will be able to give me news of how my friend Bebel is getting on at the 
charitable institution in Zwickau.64 I have heard nothing further of Bebel 
since Singer was over here in December. I know, of course, that deten­
tion will have no effect whatever on his intellectual powers, but I should

health. He must have found it very hard to be behind bars with nothing 
to do during the election campaign, but that is all the more reason why 
he should have been pleased with the results; they tally exactly with the 
prediction he gave me months ago: a big gain in votes but a drop in 
mandates.15 The latter is not only easily borne—only Liebknecht's 
absence is a real loss—but in many ways is also an advantage. Indeed this 
is now being admitted by people of whom one would least expect it; 
people who themselves took a quiet pleasure in parliamentarism are now 
loudly proclaiming to all and sundry what a good thing it is that the 
party and, in particular, the parliamentary group should no longer be in 
danger of lapsing into parliamentarism! All to the good if grapes are sour 
now and again. On the other hand, the 225,000 new votes we have 
gained, despite the most cruel oppression, are a step forward which has 
made itself felt throughout Europe and America and has even soured the 
momentary triumph of the gentlemen in power. This very lack of undue 
haste, this measured but nonetheless inexorable advance, has about it 
something tremendously impressive which cannot but arouse in the 
rulers the same sense of dread as was experienced by the prisoners of the 
state inquisition in that room in Venice where the walls moved inwards 
an inch each day, so that as time went on they were able to estimate the 
day on which the walls must squash them. 
Throughout the past autumn and winter Russian and Prussian diplo­
macy has been at pains to engineer a localised war and prevent a 
European one. The Russians would have liked to crush Austria alone, 
the Prussians France alone, while the rest were supposed to look on.14 
Unfortunately these well-intentioned endeavours were mutually incom­
patible in that whoever attacked first would have provoked a world war. 
That the days of localised wars were over was, of course, obvious to any 
child, but not to the clever men who govern Europe; only now are the 
great statesmen finding this out and they really are somewhat afraid of a 
world conflagration, for its effects would be incalculable and more than 
even the Prussian and Russian armies could cope with. And so far as I'm 
concerned herein lies the only remaining guarantee of peace we have. 
Would you please be kind enough to tell Bebel when you see him that 
the first edition of the English translation of Das Kapital* was sold out 
in 2 months and that the second is printing. And this before any of the 
bigger papers had devoted an article to the book!

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 29 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 16 March 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
Very many thanks for your letters of 28 February and 2 March along 
with enclosures, and also for all the trouble you have taken. I return 
herewith the Executive's circular32 as we have got a copy. Concerning 
the Volkszeitung's article (so the charming Jonas had suppressed 
Aveling's answer for a whole month before deciding to print it), we 
promptly sent Jonas the enclosed reply today. Should he not print it and 
if you could then put some sort of pressure on him, that would be splen­
did.65 But his article does seem to indicate a partial retraction. 
The great controversy over the dubious items in Aveling's accounts 
will no doubt have now been resolved by our circular of 26 February.47 
Nevertheless it is strange that people should make a fuss about details 
such as these which cannot possibly be understood except in context— 
that these people haven't said to themselves that they ought first to hear 
what the other side has to say about that context before permitting 
themselves to pass judgment. Every one of these items would also have 
appeared in Liebknecht's accounts if he had ever submitted any. But 

=====第49页=====
38 Letters -1887 
what he said was this: the party must meet all my expenses and I shan't 
put down anything at all. And with that they were satisfied. The fact that 
Aveling subsequently met virtually all the expenses incurred, e.g. in 
Boston, not only by Liebknecht, but also by his daughter, a is not 
mentioned by the Executive, although these are shown in the accounts 
and we were decent enough not to put it in the circular. Thus, during the 
time they were travelling together, Liebknecht ordered all their wine, 
etc., to be sent up to Aveling's room and hence charged to Aveling's 
account. The Executive knows all about it and is keeping it dark. But 
shabbiest of all is their failure to send us their circular, released over there 
on 7 January, until 3 February, so that they had a clear month in which 
to spread their slanderous stories at their leisure before we so much as 
discovered what Aveling was actually accused of. 
Pending further information, I don't believe that the resolution was 
accepted by the majority of the sections. If I am to go by what Aveling 
and Tussy say, the Knights of Labor60 attitude is directly opposed to the 
views of all the sections in the West. And if this should nevertheless 
prove to be the case, the whole 'party' can go to the devil. 
It is truly fortunate that you should send me the Sozialist. Hitherto I 
have been able to pass on my second copy, which I get from the 
Executive, to Kautsky or the Avelings, so that it has been turned to good 
account. This week no paper has arrived from those charming people, 
from which I can only conclude that the next Nos will contain more 
scurrilities about Aveling. 
A letter has been sent to Müller in St Paul asking him if he would also 
publish the 2nd circular of 26 February. 66 While the Executive, covertly, 
as is its wont, makes the most of every journalistic ploy, it evidently 
intends to push the responsibilities onto Aveling should he himself be 
the first to go into print. 
To us over here it seemed quite natural that Aveling should not reply 
to the New York  Herald.  The article was quite abysmally absurd, on top 
of which they both say that it is not the custom in America to reply seri­
ously to such tomfooleries. From my own knowledge of the Herald it is 
most unlikely that the paper would have accepted it. And when the arti­
cle was reprinted over here, Aveling replied at once.25  But even if Aveling 
had replied to the Herald article, how would that have helped him vis-
à-vis the Executive} It sounds to me like a lame excuse by Shevich. All 
in all I'm surprised at the utter spinelessness of most of the people in 
a Gertrud Liebknecht

New York as revealed by this affair. The Executive spreads whopping 
lies and everyone believes them—from Jonas to Shevich and the

It is truly fortunate that our people no longer constitute a 'faction' in 
the Reichstag—for the next few years, at any rate, this will be just as 
well.681 also like the way so many have all of a sudden come to regard 
'parliamentarism' as discreditable. Irresistible, gradually accelerating 
growth in the number of votes—that is the main thing. Our struggle is 
a form of siege warfare and so long as the approach trenches keep 
moving forward, all will be well. We are already close to the second 
parallel, where we shall be able to establish our dismounting batteries 
and silence the enemy's guns. And, if we get as far without the 
besieged's gaining temporary respite from a world war, we shall then be 
able to estimate when it will be possible to establish breaching batteries 
on the crest of the glacis, make a breach with our guns and mount an

the best safeguard against an overhasty assault and unnecessary casual­

are in a state of siege!

My dear Laura, 
I have received Fortin 's Ms. 23 which, I am afraid, will have to rest a bit 
in my drawer, as I must still nurse my eye. Of course the inflammation 
was merely symptomatic of the real affliction, a weakness brought on by 
over-exertion of the eye especially at night-time, and that can be cured 
by nothing but the removal of the cause; in consequence Nim and I pass 
our evenings now at card-playing and I find it acts, but has to be contin­
ued yet a bit. If Paul continues his work at the Bibliothèque etc. in the 
usual way, I am afraid he will have to suffer for it, though of course his 
doctor ought to know. 
To settle business first: I enclose cheque for £12, and further inform 
you that nothing has been heard here from Longuet. I sent him a post­
card 69 about the copy of Capital addressed to La Justice, asking if he had 
got it; no reply either.

The gifles 3- between the Voie and the Cri may amuse the Parisians 
but I should be very sorry to see our friends there sinking to the level 
of saltimbanques at foires^ forcing themselves upon the attention of the 
public by quarrels and fights provoked for that purpose. If that will go 
down in Paris, it will certainly not anywhere else, and it is certainly not 
the way to raise our Parisian friends in the esteem of the working class 
out of France. I can conceive Goullé boxing Labruyère's ears while 
they had the Voie to give their own account of the affair, 0 but the repe­
tition by Goullé and Deville after the paper was dead, and they had to 
take refuge in the Radical, seems to me utterly out of all common 
sense. The version of the Cri reaches all the foreign socialist papers; 
that of the Radical does not, unless forwarded express. And whether or 
not, this mode of settling disputes after the manner of the German 
Knoten d before 1848 will give foreigners a very poor idea of the lead­
ers of French Socialism and makes one almost regret the duelling prac­
tices of the Second Empire journalists, as being only ridiculous. The 
sooner the whole affair is forgotten, the better it will be for our 
people.70 
Old William, if not actually dead, seems to be dying—vide enclosed 
cut from the Weekly Dispatch.71  And the dynamite shells of St 
Petersburg seem after all not to have missed their aim. Vide the abject 
declaration which through Reuter (!!) the Russian government have sent 
round Europe. 72 The Czare goes on his knees before revolution, and 
even the Russophile Daily Newsi  says this abject document can be 
compared only to the abject telegram of Alexander Battenberg to the 
Czar. 73 This thing looks indeed like the beginning of the end in Russia, 
and that would be the beginning of the end in Europe too. What a fool 
that Czar must be! Not to see that when he ordered the plot to kidnap 
and, if necessary, to kill that poor ass Alexander Battenberg, he justified 
the same proceedings against  himself,  and called upon his own enemies 
to apply to him his own methods!

Dear Sorge, 
Have received postcard together with the Dietzgen cutting, 24 March, 
and letter of 25 ditto. Hepner could hardly be in a position to judge from 
those few disconnected facts whether Aveling ought to have been 'more 
frank'.75 I myself wouldn't venture to say so; all I know is that Aveling 
is as unfortunate in money matters as Hepner  himself.  Both have an 
enviable talent for getting mixed up in money squabbles through no 
fault of their own. 
Whoever told you that Kautsky had become restive was either lying 
or had been lied to. I would trust Kautsky as I would trust  myself;  like 
most young men he is sometimes apt to be a bit opinionated, but if he 
harboured any doubts I would be the first to whom he would confide 
them. Anyway, I shall ask him this evening to what, if anything, the 
statement can refer.

contain  himself.  He writes as follows (this between ourselves; please 
don't pass on the exact wording, but only as much of the contents as you 
think fit) (25 March): 
'The New Yorkers will probably toe the line. I had already—weeks 
ago—written and told them in no uncertain terms that, no matter what 
the circumstances, I refused to allow myself to be played off against 
Aveling and Tussy. I have categorically insisted upon a full apology 
and, as I have said, I think they will comply. It's a great pity Aveling 
didn't write to me immediately after his return.' 
(this is an empty excuse, since I had already informed him of the 
essentials round about 20 January,76 in so far as they were known to 
ourselves at the time) 
—'it was from you I first learnt about the whole thing and by then we 
were in the midst of the electoral hurly-burly which, of course, 
claimed my whole attention. And so a lot of time was lost. But every­
thing's bound to come out all right. If the New Yorkers dig their heels 
in, I shall attack them publicly. You can tell Aveling and Tussy so.' 
On the whole the tide seems to be turning very much against the 
gentlemen of the Executive. Aveling has received sympathetic letters 
from several private quarters in New York; the American Rochester 
section has expressed its continuing confidence in him, the German 
Cleveland (or Buffalo? I forget) section has come out unanimously in his 
favour. And as much as a month ago the Executive—without waiting for 
the sections' votes—submitted all the files to the Board of Supervisors 
for a decision—i.e. appealed to another tribunal! We, of course, immedi­
ately wrote to them as well, sending documents and insisting that they 
examine certain letters, etc. 
You will have had a copy of Aveling's reply to the second and, indeed, 
even more infamousq article in the Volkszeitung. 65 
Our Parisians have again got themselves into a fix. They had lost the 
Cri du Peuple,™ and now the Socialiste has also died for want of funds. 
The Paris working men have so spoilt their digestions with 50 years of 
sectarian and phrase-mongering socialism that they cannot at present 
stomach wholesome fare. Paris, le centre des lumières, la ville de l'idée,

78 In Russia, on the other hand, a crisis would seem imminent. The 
recent assassination attempts77 were just about the last straw, every­

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 53 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 9 April 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
I wrote to you on the 6tha and have had your letter of 29 March. 
Many thanks for your efforts re Jonas.79 I think they will bear fruit. 
So the Executive intends to reply. That will mean a further suppres­
sion of facts. But the decision to reply is in itself proof of how base and 
silly it was to try and worm a verdict out of the sections merely on the 
strength of the Executive's first allegations. First the sections were 
supposed to decide. Then, even before the expiry of the time limit they 
had been set, the Executive goes and implores the Board of Supervisors 
for a verdict. And now the Executive itself admits that further investiga­
tions will be necessary before a decision can be reached.

At all events, the chaps have cut their own throats. And if the 
Wischnewetzkys who, throughout, have behaved more like 
Dishragskis,3 have been forced to describe them as liars, etc., things must 
have come to a pretty pass. The very fact that Wischnewetzky decided 
to show you my letterb is proof of the quandary these two people are in. 
As much as a year ago, however, I was 'humane' enough to dismiss the 
Executive as true German louts. 
I'm glad in as much as I can now hope to be relieved of Mrs 
Wischnewetzky's importunities in the matter of translations. In the first 
place she translates mechanically, leaving all the real work to me, in the 
second, having delayed publication0 in the most deplorable way, she let 
the thing fall into the hands of the said louts.80 But we are now no longer 
in the position of having to hawk around our manuscripts. And now that 
I've written a preface0" for her into the bargain, something's evidently 
amiss just because the said preface is not to the liking of the Executive! 
The Avelings have also had sympathetic messages and resolutions 
from the section in Springfield, Massachusetts; no doubt others will be 
coming in from the West during the next few days. 
The Swiss government would seem—according to conservative 
English reports—to be preparing to move against the Zurich 
Sozialdemokrat. 81 I have been expecting this ever since the war-like 
hubbub first arose; endanger his neutrality and your Swiss turns really 
nasty. However, it may yet blow over. 
On the other hand it looks very much as though the 2 latest assassi­
nation attempts in Russia77 have been the last straw. For a long time no 
one has had any faith in the government, and now they've lost faith in 
the Tsar as well. The army is full of discontented, conspiring officers. 
The Pan-Slavs82 want to place the half-brothere of the present Tsar/ the 
eldest son of Alexander II and la Dolgoruky on the throne. And the 
police are powerless against the Nihilists.83  According to the Frankfurter 
Zeitung, 482 officers were sent from Moscow via Odessa to the convict 
settlement on Sakhalin in the Pacific. I don't believe that it will last out 
the year, unless war provides a loophole, and even that might come too 
late. And once the fun begins in Russia, then hurrah!

making good progress.84 The relatively successful results obtained in the 
recent elections in Chicago and Cincinnati85 have been of great assis­
tance to him here—John Bull has no wish to see himself outstripped by 
those fellows. It's the only foreign influence that is at all effective in this 
country. At the big Anti-Coercion meeting in Hyde Park the day after 
tomorrow, Aveling will be speaking from two and Tussy from one of the 
fifteen platforms.86 It promises to be one of those big meetings whereby 
the London working men make manifest a crisis in English politics.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
IN PARIS 
London, 13 April 1887 
My dear Lafargue, 
Herewith the letter for your publisher.* I hope you will be successful 
this time but in any case make sure the copy is returned to you since I 
have no other to send you.88 Also negotiate for 20 to 25 free copies for 
us; we shall be sorely in need of them. 
I shall send you the Daily Telegraph's report on the meeting of the 
day before yesterday, in which there in much talk of Tussy.86 
Schorlemmer was there. It was undoubtedly the biggest meeting we have 
ever held here. 
The New York affair24 is going very well. The gentlemen of the 
Executive Committee have done so many silly things that they have 
already scuppered themselves. It has been a very long business and a 
very tortuous one, but we no longer have anything to fear from that 
quarter. 
You must have a high opinion of Mr Sonnenschein if you suppose 
that we have at our disposal copies of the article by Aveling and Tussy. I 
have only seen the proofs, but I shall ask Tussy to have a copy sent me 
for you. 89 They'll have to pay for it; Sonnenschein treats his authors as 
though they were mere clerks.

The day before yesterday the great anarchist Kropotkin accepted the 
hospitality of the Social Democratic Federation62  and was with them and 
Davitt on their waggonnette. Typically, when someone suggested taking 
Davitt to see Aveling, Davitt said: I cannot meet him because he is an 
atheist! 
Impossible to press for the appearance of your article in Time—Price 
is in the midst of leaving Swan & Sonnenschein, says it is his partner 
Lowrey who is running the review—a man we have never set eyes on. If 
only you knew the confusion and disorder that reign in that business, 
you'd be far more patient. 
Put yourself forward as candidate in any case, whether or no you stand 
a chance.90 It is something you have got to go through, especially in Paris 
and especially now that you have managed once again to kill off all your 
periodicals.91 There's nothing else you can do, for agitation involves 
keeping oneself in the public eye. With 10,000 francs you can maintain a 
weekly paper for a long time, and you ought to be able to raise that sum. 
Come to that, I hope that revolution in Russia will relieve your difficul­
ties and will set Europe in motion. Three assassination attempts in thirty 
days92—enough, I should have thought, even for a Tsar.a According to the 
English press, even the pro-Russian, everything is topsy-turvy in Russia; 
faith in the power of the administration has been shattered, the army 
teems with Nihilists83—482 officers exiled to the island of Sakhalin 
(Pacific)b—, while the peasants, crushed by emancipation,93 taxation and 
usury, have been dealt a mortal blow in the shape of compulsory military 
service on the Prussian system.78 Add to that the permanent financial 
crisis,  the paper ruble worth 2 fr. 8 or 9 centimes instead of 4, American 
and Indian competition in corn and not a banker in Europe prepared to 
lend—such a state of affairs cannot last out the year! 
Schorlemmer sends his regards.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 53 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 23 April 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
I wrote to you on the 9th inst.a  Postcard and packages received with 
thanks. The publication in the Volkszeitung of my preface 12 in a trans­
lation made over there is doubly scandalous. Firstly because I wish to 
have nothing to do with the paper so long as it goes on behaving so 
despicably towards Aveling. Secondly, however, because I cannot 
approve of my English works being rendered into German by a 
stranger, especially when the said stranger makes a mass of mistakes and 
misconstrues the most important passages. The person13 has had my 
preface since the beginning of February (posted on 27 January)0 and in 
the only letter I have received since then, dated 19 March, postmarked 
8 April, she merely mentions her intention of bringing out a German 
edition and asks for my assent—she knew I had no copy here. I wrote 
at once76 asking her to return me the original so that I could translate it; 
there are passages in it where every word must be meticulously 
weighed. And meanwhile she has been conniving with Jonas & Co. 
behind my back. 
I immediately protested. You should ask her to show you my letter.76 
This is the last straw. It's utterly impossible to work with someone 
who keeps on playing such tricks. 
But there's one more thing she's got coming to her. Her last long letter 
about the Aveling affair24 may be summed up in one word: abominable. 
An attempt by someone who is weak, who is swayed by every puff of 
wind, to uphold the Tightness of a cause she herself knows to be rotten. 
I shall reply to her next week con amore. A person like that mustn't 
imagine that I can be bamboozled like a baby. 
Hyndman's letter to The Standard^ is both pitiful and pusillanimous.

He wants to remain in George's good graces when the latter is becoming 
ever more embroiled with his hobby-horse, land,94 and hence must 
suppress everything of a socialist nature. He is down on his luck again. 
The sensational effects have vanished into thin air, nor are new ones to 
be had every day. Without them, however, Hyndman cannot sustain his 
role.  On the other hand the Avelings have begun agitating to consider­
able effect in the Radical Clubs22 of the East End and in so doing are 
laying special emphasis on the example of an independent labour party 
set by the Americans.84 And the American example is the only one that 
has any pull here—along with that of the German elections.15 The cause 
is progressing well and may—if things go on in America as they have 
been doing—cost the Liberals the entire East End of London before the 
year is out. 
In the Socialist League, too, matters are slowly approaching a crisis. 
At Whitsun the delegates hold their conference when a decision will, I 
hope, be reached in the struggle with the anarchist elements who have 
wormed their way in and have Morris as a supporter.95 
In Germany there are reprisals upon reprisals.96 It's as though 
Bismarck wants to get everything ready so that when revolution breaks 
out in Russia, in what is now probably only a matter of months, the fun 
can likewise begin in Germany.

the animal kingdom than the rest of us, he is undoubtedly the most 
appropriate representative of that district.90  Let us hope the animaux 
will have the best of it in this struggle against the bêtes.* I am rather 
surprised at Baslu's holding back, but if a set of men succeeds in being 
excluded from the press altogether, 91 what can they expect? Fom Mesa's 
letter in the Spanish Socialista I see that the Blanquists too are making 
volte-face and approaching the Possibilists19 —another bad sign. A little 
success—even relative—at the elections would therefore be very 
welcome when our people are under such a momentary cloud. I know 
very well that that cloud will pass, that Parisian party life is a continual 
change of ups and downs, but at the same time I cannot but wish that 
next time they will cherish their own little weekly paper a little more 
than those disreputable dailies to which they work hard to give a repu­
tation in order to be kicked out as soon as they have succeeded. 
That Stanton of yours seems to be an out-and-out Yankee. But the 
cutest Yankee in Europe is as often and as much out of his element as the 
toughest Polish Jew. They misjudge the people they have to deal with.97 
The New York Executive have launched in their despair another 
circular against Aveling saying that his statements are lies, yet making 
very important admissions in our favour.98  We shall of course reply. But 
the affair is practically ended, the Executive are themselves accused in 
New York as swindlers and liars in another affair and on their trial 
before the New York sections; so that whatever they have said, say, or 
may say, loses all importance. In the meantime the Aufsichtsbehörde^ of 
the American party appeals to them (to Edward and Tussy) to let the 
matter drop, and from very many places they receive very nice letters 
both from Americans and Germans. So that matter is virtually settled. 
Edward and Tussy's agitation in the East End clubs is going on very 
favourably. The American example has its effects; it at last offers a handle 
to stir up the English working people.84 
In the League21 the Anarchists are on the decline, as everywhere when 
they are seriously handled instead of being trifled with. Their last 
proposal yesterday in the Council was, that at the Conference of 
Delegates95  all vérification des mandats should be suppressed and 
anybody accepted who said he was a delegate—to allow them to manu­
facture their usual bogus votes. This however was too much even for 
Morris; yet a minority of five was found to vote for such nonsense!

The Pagny affair" is not quite clear to me yet. The gist of the matter 
lies in Art. 4, No. 1, of the German Penal Code: 
'Pourra être poursuivi selon les  lois pénales de l'empire allemand: 
1) un étranger qui aura commis, à l'étranger  {en pays étranger) un acte 
de haute trahison contre l'empire allemand ou contre un des états fédérés, 
ou qui aura fait de la fausse monnaie.'* 
To apply this article to anybody but a political refugee not naturalised 
abroad, must produce a collision with the country of the man prose­
cuted. No nation in its senses will stand such treatment and if they tried 
it upon an Englishman, the most peaceable minister would be compelled 
to send at once the British fleet to the German coast. Therefore this 
looks as if Bismarck wanted to place France between war or humiliation. 
For that he was ignorant of the warrant against Schnaebelé is impossible. 
And yet the state of Europe is such that a war would be, for Bismarck, 
to play va banque. The man must be completely mad to act thus. 
Perhaps a few days more will give a clue. I really cannot imagine him to 
be such a consummate ass.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 100 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 4 May 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
I trust you are feeling better and that your fears about becoming quite 
incapable of writing will not be realised. I too have found writing diffi­
cult; since the New Year I have had chronic ophthalmia, which has 
greatly restricted my reading and particularly my writing. Next week I 
shall be consulting one of the leading ophthalmologists here. 
What you say about the New York louts in your letter of 20 April 
last101 is certainly quite right, but you mustn't forget that I can only 
answer the points you yourself raise, not those about which you say 
nothing. 
The Manifesto has been translated, and only these damned eyes of 
mine are preventing me from going through it. In my desk I have one 
French, one Italian and one Danish ms. which are also waiting to be gone 
through!102 Besides, you were Germans 40 years ago, with a German 
sense of theory, and that was why the Manifesto was effective, whereas 
it had no effect at all on other peoples, although it had been translated 
into French, English, Flemish, Danish, etc. And for the untheoretical, 
matter of fact Americans different, plainer fare will, I believe, be more 
wholesome, since we took part in the events depicted in the Manifesto 
while they did not. 
As to my book,3  the business has been well and truly bungled by la 
Wischnewetzky, who gave Miss Foster plein pouvoir} 1 which Miss 
Foster then gave to the Executive. 80—I immediately protested, but the 
thing had been done. Up till now la Wischnewetzky has bungled every­
thing she has laid her hands on and I'll never give her anything again; she 
can do as she pleases and I shall be happy if she accomplishes something, 
but I've had enough and she must leave me in peace in the future. I 
replied to her last letter a week ago today.76

At Liebknecht's request I have sent him the copy of the circular you 
sent me, but on condition he returns it. He has promised to send the 
necessary piece for publication.98 
Aveling is doing famously with his agitation in the East End of 
London.84 The American example is proving a draw there and the 
Radical Clubs—which the Liberals have to thank for their 12 seats out 
of 69 in London—have approached him about lectures on the American 
movement and he and Tussy are hard at work. The immediate intention 
is to found an English labour party with an independent class 
programme. This would, if all went well, push both the Social 
Democratic Federation62 and the Socialist League21 into the background, 
which would be the best way of resolving the impending rows. 
Hyndman knows that it is a matter of life or death to him, especially as 
he has made enemies of nearly all his people. He has therefore taken up 
injustice the Executive's charge against Aveling.103 This is just as well, as 
it will put an end to the backbiting, while Aveling will have an opportu­
nity to air the matter in public. At Whitsuntide the attitude of the 
Socialist League will also be clarified, I hope; the Anarchists must be 
chucked out, or the whole business will be ruined.95 
The Avelings arranged to send you Time with their articles on 
America. I imagine you must have got them (March, April, May 
numbers)." Even the Tory Standard praises them! At the moment the 
Avelings are doing more and to much better effect than anyone else over 
here and yet I'm supposed to reply to Mother Wischnewetzky about her 
childish misgivings over the grave charge under which Dr Aveling will 
stand until he has disproved the circular of the Executive! Surrounded as 
she is by her tongue-wagging German sisters, Madame has evidently lost 
sight of the fact that it is not for Aveling to disprove but rather for the 
Executive to prove. 
Commonweal, Gleichheit and To-Day are going off to you by today's

Dear Ede, 
You're the most incorrigible Hamlet I have ever come across. You are 
aware that Kautsky and I keep completely aloof from the local German 
goings-on here105 and have to do so if all our time is not to be wasted on 
piffling tittle-tattle. You are aware that we haven't got a single 
spokesman in the local association because all these people are involved 
in embittered feuds of the pettiest kind.106 So if we do anything at all in 
this matter, it will cause a stir, the chaps will want to know the whys and 
wherefores, and the next day it will be the gossip of all the anarchist 
clubs.  If you were to come over here, a visit to the club and a chat there 
would at once put you in a position to find out all you want within the

space of two or three days, and without causing any stir at all. So in addi­
tion to depriving us of a pleasure if you stay away, you would fulfil only 
half the purpose of your journey. The only person we could bring into 
play would be old Lessner, and he has grown so rusty that he'd make a 
pauvre* diplomat. 
There's nothing about the Babeuf affair in Avenel's Lundis* 0 or 
Anarchasis Cloots.—Yes, there is—pp. 42 and 94. 107—So I shall send you 
the Lundis by registered post. Please let me have it back soon, i.e. in 
about a fortnight, since I need the book for reference and can't very well 
dispense with it. I used to have the main source, namely Buonarroti's 
Conspiration de Babeuf,  in an English translation 0 brought out by the 
Chartists but, like so much else, it has been pinched; I have had another 
good look for it, but without result. 
As regards the Russians, there is a point that ought now to be stressed 
but of which I have nowhere seen any mention.108 All over Europe reac­
tionaries are fuming about Nihilist regicide83  and the use of dynamite in 
particular, special objects of odium being Russian revolutionaries, whose 
extradition to Russia they are demanding not without success, even in 
America. But what is the Russian government up to? In Sofia it gets 
Alexander Battenberg deposed and, if he wasn't shot in the process, this 
was thanks solely to his own ineptitude. 109 In Bucharest it instigates 
assassination attempts on Bulgarian civil governors.d And, lastly—some 
four weeks ago in Sofia—it gets a dynamite bomb thrown at the house 
of Major  Popoff, e the commandant or whatever he  is. 110 So everything 
the Russian government reproaches the Nihilists with and for which it 
demands their extradition as common criminals, it  is itself doing through 
the medium of its notorious agents in Bulgaria. We must demand that, in 
respect of these specifically Russian modes of procedure, the same stan­
dards should be applied to revolutionaries and government alike. This is 
already felt fairly generally, but it is important that it be said—and pretty 
loudly at that. 
The Schnaebelé affair" was obviously a put-up job to get Boulanger 
into difficulties. The only person to have got the story right, and this as 
much as a fortnight ago, was Mother Crawford, the Paris correspondent 
of the Daily News and the Weekly Dispatch, as is confirmed by 
Bismarck's dispatch.

fact of her choosing just now, on the eve of a clash with the anarchists in 
the League (at the Whitsun delegates' conference95), to consort with the 
latter—so much so that the others already call her the Anarchist 
Countess—is something that must be taken into account. Strictly between 
ourselves, however, I think she is, all in all, pretty innocuous. 
Aveling and Tussy are conducting a splendid propaganda campaign in 
the East End Radical Clubs,84 which have been galvanised into life by 
the example of America and are now seriously thinking of forming an 
independent labour party. The chaps came to Aveling of their own 
accord and that's an excellent sign. Should we succeed in gaining a firm 
foothold there, the Social Democratic Federation62 and the Socialist 
League21 will both be pushed into the background, and a start will have 
been made on the conquest of London. What is immediately at stake in 
this instance is a dozen parliamentary seats—these clubs have hitherto 
been a source of strength to the Liberals here. And even Hyndman has 
seen the red light, which is why he is repeating in Justice the calumnies 
levelled against Aveling by the New York Executive.103 This is just what 
we want for the furtherance of our campaign. But you can see how diffi­
cult our work over here is being made by the lubberly calumnies of the 
wretched New York Executive. 
Mumma,1 who is here at the moment, sends her regards.

ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY 10 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 7 May 1887 
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
I have received your note of April 25 with thanks but no preface; if I 
receive it per next steamer on Monday I shall send you word at once. In 
the meantime as I received no copy of the book" as yet, will you please 
see that I get at least something to work upon, a proof-sheet or whatever 
it is, as the Volkszeitung translation 12 cannot pass under any circum­
stances, I shall work at the translation as fast as my inflamed eye will 
allow. I am only sorry you did not send the ms. or a proof as soon as the 
idea of a separate German edition occurred to you.111 
Sorge writes to me: 
'Wischnewetzky's bedauern sehr, durch die Verheimlichungen und 
Unterschlagungen der Executive zur Absendung des bekannten Briefs 
an Dich veranlasst worden zu sein, und haben sich alle erdankliche 
Mühe gegebeng, Aveling in der New Yorker Sektion Gerechtigkeit zu 
verschaffen.' b'112 
If this, as I must suppose, was written with your consent, then I am 
perfectly satisfied, and have no desire whatever to return to that subject 
in a spirit of controversy. 
Nobody was more rejoiced than I when I learnt that the book was 
finally out of the hand of that despicable Executive and of the Socialist 
Labor Party80 generally. Forty years' experience have shown me how 
useless and literally thrown away are all these publications, by small 
cliques, that by their very mode of publication are excluded from the 
general book-market, and thereby from literary cognizance. It was the 
a The American edition of Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in 
England - ° 'The Wischnewetzkys regret very much having been induced—by 
the Executive's suppression of facts and misappropriation of funds—to send you 
the notorious letter and have been making every effort to secure justice for 
Aveling in the New York section.'

same thing even with the party publications in Germany up to 1878; and 
only since the Sozialistengesetz*' 52 which forced our people to organize 
a book trade of their own. b in opposition both to the government and to 
the officially organized Leipzig book-trade, has this been overcome. 
And I do not see why in America where the movement begins with such 
gigantic and imposing force, the same mistakes, with the same draw­
backs in their wake, should be quite unnecessarily gone through over 
again. The whole Socialist, and, in England, Chartist literature has 
thereby been made so extinct that even the British Museum cannot now 
procure copies at any price! 
I remain, dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
very sincerely yours

about la Wischnewetzky and her sorrow over the denunciatory letter* 
she sent, I can only assume that you wrote it with her consent in order 
that she be spared an outright pater peccavi!0 I had to write to her today 
and therefore told her: if that, as I must suppose, was written with her 
consent, I was perfectly satisfied and had no longer any reason to revert 
to that subject in a spirit of controversy. So you see, I want to make 
things as easy as possible for her. However she's not only inept, but a 
Jonah if ever there was one. She has written to say that she wants to 
bring out my preface in German.111  Naturally I have no objection to 
that. But though aware that I hadn't got a copy, she nevertheless omit­
ted to send me the ms. at the same time so that I could translate it. Nor 
have I received either the book itself or a proof-sheet of the preface— 
instead, the preface was handed over to the Volkszeitung for translation. 
This last has proved to be a thoroughly insipid affair and, what's more, 
the mistakes it contains almost lead me to imagine that she has not even 
made an accurate copy of my English ms. 12 Well, she now writes to say 
that the ms. has at last gone off (not a word about the Volkszeitung 
translation)—but there' s still no sign of the ms.! 
I'm particularly pleased that Mr Jonas has had to eat humble pie.113 
Considering his jealousy of the Executive in the business sphere, he was 
the last person one would have expected to bestir himself on their behalf 
and, precisely because he knew he had burnt his fingers, he has behaved 
as shabbily as could be throughout the whole episode. 
Friend Liebknecht, too, is suddenly proving reluctant 'to break with 
the Executive'. As to the $8,000 that has been sent, the Executive is 
trying to use it as a bribe, nor could the Germans possibly stand up to 
such people! However I have put a pistol to the head of the worthy 
Liebknecht, who has grown anxious all of a sudden not to fall out with 
either side, and he'll come round all right. If he hadn't made such fools 
of us, our reply to Circular II would have long since been ready. 98 But it 
is not really so urgent and should clinch the matter. We have won, thanks 
to your support and all you have done; without you we should still be a 
long way from where we are now. What a good thing that we old chaps 
can still depend on one another.

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI 
IN BENEVENTO 
London, 21 May 1887 
Dear Citizen Martignetti, 
I'm glad to be able to inform you that my efforts on your behalf have 
not been entirely unsuccessful.8  Johannes Wedde, editor of the (soc.) 
Bürger-Zeitung in Hamburg, has written to me as follows: 
'A businessman here (cotton firm), who is a personal friend of mine 
and has no political prejudices, may perhaps have an opening for 
Martignetti, though only a modest one to begin with. However he 
would like Martignetti to send a photograph first. I find this rather 
odd—as does my friend himself—but it is necessary on practical 
grounds. It would be a good idea if the photograph were sent to this 
gentleman by Martignetti in person, together with a letter of recom­
mendation. His name is Johannes Paul, of the firm of Paul & 
Steinberg, Alterwall 58.' 
So if you want to find out whether a post is available there, you would 
be well-advised to send Mr Paul your photograph. Overleaf is the draft 
of a letter for you to send him, worded in conformity with German 
commercial usage. I would remind you not to engage in any overt polit­
ical activity while in Hamburg, because if you do you will certainly be 
expelled. The position of socialists in Germany gets worse every day and 
further coercive legislation is in the offing. On the other hand this may

give you a chance to find an opening in commerce and thus embark on 
a new career. 
My eye seems to be getting better at last. But I can't yet turn my mind 
to serious work, so your manuscript* is still in abeyance. 
With kindest regards, 
Ever yours, 
F. Engels 
To Johannes Paul, Hamburg. 
I was pleased to learn through Mr Joh. Wedde that there is a prospect 
of my securing employment with your esteemed firm but that you 
would like to see my photograph first. I enclose same herewith and 
would mention that for the past (il numéro degli anni h) ... years I have 
been employed in the Royal Notary's Office here. I should be greatly 
obliged if you would be so good as to furnish me with particulars of the 
work I should be required to do and of any other conditions. Were the 
prospect of this post to materialise, I should gladly do all in my power 
to discharge my new duties in accordance with your wishes. With 
sincere thanks for your sympathetic interest.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
IN PARIS 
London, 21 May 1887 
My dear Laura, 
A few words in a hurry. There is hope of a place for Martignetti in 
Hamburg—correspondence about this has kept me busy to-day.a You 
will have seen injustice how Hyndman has tried to bring out Edward's 
American bother,103 but has apparently got more than he expectedb—his 
retreat in this week's No. is undignified enough.114 A 3rd Circular on 
this affair is in the printer's hands.115 1 have had some droll correspon­
dence with Liebknecht about the letter from him it will publish. In New 
York we are completely victorious and that is the chief point; and our 
final circular I hope will settle the business. 
Paul's success is though externally negative, still quite satisfactory.90 
Only the ballotage seems to have been attempted on rather too Parisian 
grounds. However it gives him a better standing for the future. 
I confess the success of Brousse and Co. is inconceivable to me. 116 It is 
no use crying after a new 'journal quotidien c after having been kicked out 
of ever so many and after having secured so little permanent effect out of it 
while our friends had it. 91 But all the same the next best thing to a victory 
of our people is the entry of Brousse and Co. into the City Council—there 
they will have to show what they are. Cremer, Howell and Co. were never 
lower in London than now since they are in Parliament. 
My congratulations to Paul for having cudgelled one of his electors. 
Ça doit avoir produit un effete 
My eye is considerably better since I have taken to smoke different 
cigars. There was the determining cause of the whole affair. You may 
laugh but I shall as soon as I have time explain to Paul medicinally that 
the thing was entirely caused by applying too much guano to the 
tobacco-fields of the Vuelta Abajo, Of course I have to be very careful 
still, limit reading and writing. I am rather curious to see how the 
Ministerial crisis in France will end117 —unless it brings in Clemenceau,

66 Letters -1887 
it will be the old affair over again, and I doubt whether Clemenceau will 
go in just now. He is the last resource of the bourgeois republic and 
would be soft to go in without a dissolution. 
Edward and Tussy speak to-day in an open air meeting in Victoria 
Park, Hackney; the weather was boisterous and wet though, showery up 
to 4 p.m., now better. Don't know the hour of meeting, but hope it's late 
in the afternoon. Their agitation in the East End is going on quietly and 
steadily.84 Next Sunday Delegate Conference of the League.95 Will 
decide its fate. Both League and Federation62 are in a bad way; 
Hyndman is in very bad odour again amongst his lot, has fallen out with 
Champion, and Burns goes about preaching an independent union of the 
working men of both societies leaving Hyndman, Morris, Aveling and 
Co. to fight out their quarrels themselves. 
So much for to-day - the implacable Nim calls with the dinner-bell.

Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
I find both Injustice and Sozialdemokrat of this week a notice of the 
English Lage, 11 but have myself up to now not received a single copy, nor 
even seen the book. There seems to be some queer management some­
where, which may want looking into by you.—Just this moment Karl 
Kautsky comes in and says he has received a box with 18 copies, of 
which he kindly places a few at my disposal, so that I have at least a 
chance of a look at the book. 
I am informed that the London Agentb of Mr Lovell is the firm which 
specially represents Bismarckism in the London Book Trades. This 
cannot of course be helped but is an unfortunate circumstance for us. 
Translation of preface111 just too late for this Steamer, per next mail 
certain. 
Yours faithfully

Dear Sorge, 
No movement causes so much fruitless work as one that is still at the 
sectarian stage. You know that as well as I do. For everything then still 
revolves round tittle-tattle. As will this letter about English affairs.

Well, last Sunday the conference of the Socialist League was held.95 The 
anarchist elements which had gained admission to it were victorious, being 
supported by Morris, who has a mortal hatred of all things parliamentary, 
is generally muddle-headed and, as a poet, considers himself above 
science. Resolution—in itself quite innocuous as there can after all be no 
question of parliamentary action here and now—adopted by 17 votes to 
11 (see Commonweal,  4 Junea).  Of these one was cast by an ad hoc recon­
stituted bogus branch (three men, their three wives and—Mrs Schack!) 
and three by London delegates with mandates from the provinces, which, 
however, involved an obligation to vote against any such pro-abstention 
resolution. Hence three stolen votes and one invalid one. 
What really clinched the matter was Morris' declaration that he 
would quit the moment any parliamentary action was accepted in prin­
ciple. And since Morris makes good the Commonweal's deficit to the 
tune of £4 a week, this was for many the decisive factor. 
Our people now intend to get the provinces organised, which they are 
at present well on the way to doing, and to call an extraordinary confer­
ence in about three or four months' time with a view to quashing the 
above. But it's unlikely to succeed; in the fabrication of voting sections, the 
anarchists are vastly superior to ourselves and can make eight enfranchised 
sections out of seven men. But nevertheless the farce is not without its 
good points and, having regard to the mood of the working men in the 
League, it was unavoidable. Bax is for us, of course, and, of the working 
men, Donald, Binning and Mahon amongst others—the best. None of 
ours stood for election to the Executive Council. The anarchists, by the 
way, may shortly throw our people out, and that might be all to the good. 
The main thing is that, with the emergence of a genuine labour move­
ment in the offing, our people should not be shackled with an organisa­
tion which lays claim to the leadership of the whole— à la Executive in 
New York and the Social Democratic Federation 62 over here. 
Everywhere in the provinces the workers are organising local associa­
tions (socialist) independently of London. They have a tremendous 
contempt for everything that hails from London. 
Now for some further tittle-tattle. Hardly had we finished dealing 
with the New York Executive115 than Mother Schack wrote to say she 
could no longer frequent my house because unable to meet Aveling, 
against whom there were grave imputations far more serious than the 
a 'The Socialist League', Commonweal, No.  73, 4 June 1887 

=====第82页=====
Letters- 1887 71 
charges made in America, etc. On my request that she should specify and 
provide evidence, she replied with mysterious insinuations worthy of the 
most inveterate scandalmonger, refused to provide any details or 
evidence, suggested that I should myself make inquiries in London about 
Aveling's antecedents and promised her  help!  I, of course, replied76 saying 
that / felt neither obliged nor inclined to supply proof of anything she 
might assert; this was up to her and, as she refused to do so, I could only 
thank her profusely for her decision not to call on me in future. 
I am bothering you with this only because la Schack will undoubtedly 
write to her bosom friend, Mrs Wischnewetzky, expatiating on the 
subject, and people might come pestering you about it. All this tittle-
tattle emanates from pious souls enraged by the fact that Aveling, the son 
of a parson of high repute (Congregationalist)a'122—with whom, by the 
by, he was on the best of terms until his death not long ago—had joined 
in Bradlaugh's disreputable atheist campaign; and now that Aveling has 
gone over to socialism, it is being gleefully redisseminated by Bradlaugh 
& Co. It revolves round two points, first the fact that his first wife lives 
apart from him and runs him down—she left him for a parson—and, 
secondly, his being up to his eyes in debt. He contracted those debts 1. 
through being stupid enough to endorse substantial bills for Bradlaugh's 
printer out of sheer willingness to oblige, and all unaware that Bradlaugh 
had sacked the man, thus forcing him into bankruptcy; 2. because, in 
company with Bradlaugh, he had set up a physiological laboratory and 
schoolb in Newman St, and the crafty Bradlaugh—a former attorney's 
clerk—had so arranged matters as to place sole legal responsibility on 
Aveling. When things went wrong and it came to a split between Aveling 
and Bradlaugh, it was easy for the latter to encumber Aveling with all the 
liabilities while himself openly appropriating all the assets. Aveling has 
now got to go on discharging these debts till he's blue in the face. He is 
as easy to diddle in money-matters as a three-year-old—only appeal to 
his sense of honour and he'll do anything you want. And as always, it's 
those people who are honourable to the point of absurdity when it 
comes to money, who are reviled as swindlers. All this la Schack could 
have learned from me simply by asking. But that wouldn't have suited 
her book. It was something quite different she was after. 
La Schack—in other respects a sociable, amusing person—is intent on 
cutting a figure, à tout prix. Having been pushed into our party as a result

of harassment by the police, with whom she had crossed swords over their 
control of prostitution, she embarked on a women's campaign in Germany 
which, under different circumstances, might have had some point but 
which, because of the Anti-Socialist Law,52 brought down upon the party, 
or so Singer tells me, three prosecutions for conspiracy; for no sooner did 
the women fall out among themselves than they began to gossip about, if 
not denounce, the activities of the men in the party organisation. Here 
again the police fortunately put a spoke in her wheel.a Thereupon she 
comes over here, consorts continually with the pious bourgeois women of 
the Anti-Contagious-Diseases Acts Agitation (against the attempt to 
introduce state-licensed and state-controlled brothels, and in favour of free 
trade in whores, a cause for which there is much to be said), from whom 
she picks up all the tittle-tattle about Aveling etc., also with the anarchist 
elements in the League21—some of whom listen avidly as she retails the 
self-same tittle-tattle, while others redisseminate it themselves—and 
throws herself more and more into anarchistic goings-on. When things 
came to a head in the League,95 she realised that her regular visits to me 
must cease, and cast around for a seemly or unseemly pretext for breaking 
off relations herself before they were broken off for her. Aveling was to 
serve as scapegoat to this end and hence all this tittle-tattle, which for me 
has meant nothing but an extra dose of correspondence about cock-and-
bull stories and hasn't done my eyes much good. 
And with that, goodbye for today. By the same post I am sending off 
a parcel containing I To-Day, 2 Commonweals, I Gleichheit, 5 English 
and 5 German copies of Aveling's circular. 115 
I have now sent Mrs Wischnewetzky the preface in German111 by 
registered post (Wednesday'sb steamer).

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
IN PARIS 
London, 7 June 1887 
My dear Laura, 
Here is a heap of gossip for you—while the movement is still in the 
sectarian stage it resolves itself all into gossip—and such is the case in 
England. 
Last Sunday was the Delegate Conference of the League.95 Morris 
and the Anarchists carried a resolution that the League was to hold to an 
anti-parliamentary policy—vote 17 to ll.a Amongst the 17 one bogus 
Anarchist section and 3 who voted against their instructions. The real 
reason was Morris' money which is to continue to pay the £4. weekly 
deficit of the Commonweal; if the resolution fell through, Morris would 
have resigned. 
Our friends are now going to try to organise their sections better in 
the provinces and to call an extraordinary conference to upset this. I 
don't believe in it, neither does Tussy, but the attempt is unavoidable on 
account of the feeling among the working-class element. 
One of the prominent (in a small way) members of the above bogus 
Anarchist section was Mother Schack (who by the bye is exactly your 
age!) who has lately patronized the Anarchists considerably, this appear­
ing to her the most likely means to jouer un rôle quelconque  ici} 3 As by this 
she placed herself in a position where she must either discontinue her visits 
at my house or expect an unpleasant explication, she took the initiative in

committed discreditable acts and also is slandering whom?—Tussy! I 
replied asking for particulars and proofs, and stating that unless I received 
them, I should communicate her letter to Edward. 76 Reply: she could state 
no particulars but invited me to inquire into Edward's character and 
antecedents generally, in which case she would assist me. This I naturally 
declined and again summoned her to particularise and prove, or take the 
consequences. Again she declines, warns me that 'the credit of my house'

must suffer if I take the responsibility for Edward, etc. Nothing but 
gossip, insinuations, infamies. The charge of Edward's slandering Tussy 
reduces itself to an insinuation that he spreads the idea that Tussy is 
extremely jealous!—Well, I told her in my reply that the credit of my 
house requiring from the people that met there the courage to stand by 
what they said about one another, I could only be extremely grateful to 
her for the resolution she had come to, to break off her visits. Of course 
I read the whole of the letters to Tussy and Edward who intend calling on 
her to-morrow and try to force her to some definite statement in the pres­
ence of the Kautskys. I don't think it will lead to much but let them try. 
I am glad we are happily rid of this madam who has a foot in every 
camp,  religious cranks, Anarchists, etc., and is a thorough 
Klatschschwester.* She first got the myths about Edward from her reli­
gious friends and had them confirmed by Mother Besant who has every 
reason to hold her noise but reckons on Edward's melodramatic 
generosity. And it is merely because he insisted on doing the virtuous 
hero of melodrama who is slandered right and left and rather glories in 
it because it belongs to the part and the eternal justice will end in bring­
ing out the truth and show him resplendent in all the glory of his virtue, 
that all this slander has spread. But we shall stir him up a bit, and I think 
experience has told on him a little too, so that as soon as we get hold of 
something tangible, we shall soon put an end to it all. 
Yesterday Sam Moore left here, and to-day we find a post-card 
announcing Schorlemmer for to-night. Pumps and her children are here, 
the boy is really a splendid fellow, with more irony in him than both his 
parents together can boast of. 
At last I can sit by an open window! That is something. 
Sam Moore wishes to know whether Paul has received the Beckmann, 
History of Inventions, he sent him.

ENGELS TO JULES GUESDE 
IN PARIS 
London, 11 June 1887 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Citizen Guesde, 
I would gladly lend a hand in getting the 18th Brumaire* published in 
the resuscitated Socialiste ,23 but to this there are two minor obstacles. 
In the first place, as you know, it was intended that, at the time of its 
publication in the Socialiste, the Communist Manifesto^ should also 
appear in book form. 123 For reasons which are not known to me, that 
edition never appeared, and I should like to be assured that such a thing 
will not recur. 
In the second place—and this is a matter of far greater moment—I am 
prevented by eye-trouble, which has been dragging on for the past six 
months, from taking on any literary commitments at the present time. 
And, since a great deal still remains to be done before the translation is 
completed, it is ten to one that printing will be held up and that we shall 
miss the boat altogether. 
Hence I would ask you to allow the matter to drop, for the time being 
at any rate; later on, when I am again fit for work, we might discuss it 
further. 
With best wishes for the success of the Socialiste, 
Yours very sincerely

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
IN PARIS 
London, 11 June 1887 
My dear Laura, 
Mother Schack has had her punishment. Yesterday Tussy and Edward 
went to the Kautskys, with whom she lives. Found her in. She refused to 
see Edward. Tussy and Mrs Kautsky went in to her bedroom. 
Interpellated as to what were the facts against Edward and what her 
proofs, she declined repeatedly to say anything. Tussy, after various 
severe hits, told her this refusal was a Gemeinheit* She: das lasse  ich mir 
von niemand sagen! 0—Tussy: Dann werden Sie sich es jetzt von mir noch 
einmal in Gegenwart von Louise Kautsky sagen lassen, dass es eine 
Gemeinheit ist, wenn Sie solche Anklagen vorbringen und nicht dafür 
einstehn. c Upon which she bolted out of the room, leaving Tussy in 
possession of her own bedroom! 
She even tried to get old Lessner to fall in with her slanders but got 
the worst of it. She also says Pumps is sat upon by Percy! All this comes 
out now at once, but it has had two good effects, it will make Edward 
see what his treating all that stuff with contempt leads to and will make 
him speak out about various matters about which he ought to have 
spoken in his own defence; and secondly it has helped the Kautskys out 
of their unfortunate position in the house with Scheu. They are going to 
leave and take a flat for themselves. 
I don't know whether I told you she had Mother Besant to tea the 
other day and said in her presence that all our deputies, Bebel, 
Liebknecht, Singer and all were corrupt. Kautsky jumped up and put his 
fist under her nose, he was in such a rage. If it had not been for her stay­
ing with them, we should have shaken her off long ago. 
Schorlemmer is still here, doing business as Vice-President of 
a a filthy thing to do - b I won't let anyone speak to me like that - c In that case, 
I shall repeat here, in the presence of Louise Kautsky, that to bring such charges 
against someone and refuse to substantiate them is a filthy thing to do

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 125 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 18 June 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
I shall send this letter to Rochester or better still, perhaps—to abide 
strictly by your instructions—to Hoboken. 
Postcard received. You guessed aright. The delay was all WilhelmV 
fault and I have had to hold a pistol to his head. Meanwhile you will have 
had the circulars (6 English, 6 German), sent off in my parcel of 4 June. 
End of the Schack affair: after I had thanked her heartily for propos­
ing not to visit me any more, Tussy and Aveling went to see her on 
Friday, 10 June. She received only Tussy, who demanded to know what 
facts she had to adduce against Aveling, and upon what evidence.— 
Reply again refused.—Tussy observes:-—Mrs Kautsky being present— 
That's a filthy thing to do.—La Schack: I won't let anyone speak to me 
like that.—Tussy: In that case, I shall repeat, here in the presence of 
Louise Kautsky, that to bring charges against someone else and not have 
the courage to substantiate them is a filthy thing to do.—Thereupon la 
Schack flounced out of her own bedroom, where this was taking place, 
and that was the last Tussy saw of her. A few days later she left for 
Germany. She is one of the most vulgar scandalmongers I have ever 
known, typical Prussian Junker aristo. 
I shall for the time being go on sending you the Commonweal 
because of the debate between Bax and Bradlaugh.126 Bax will hardly get 
the better of the crafty Bradlaugh—in the eyes of the public at large. He 
is very talented, studies a lot, but is still deeply immersed in German 
philosophy, which he will, no doubt, get over in the long run, but has as 
yet by no means digested. 
In the interests of accuracy I should rectify the assertion in my last 
letter about Aveling's first wife running away with a parsonb; in fact, 
they separated by mutual consent, so I shall let the matter of the said 
parson—although he did play some part in the affair—rest at that.

The Socialiste has resumed publication. Having had a legacy from his 
old man, Deville put 12,000 francs at its disposal. I shall write and tell 
Lafargue to have it sent to you, but whether or not this is done, I shall 
presumably learn only from  yourself.  I know how they go about things 
over there. 
Yesterday the Irish Coercion Bill was whipped through the House of 
Commons, clause by clause, in two minutes.86 It is a worthy companion-
piece to the Anti-Socialist Law.52 Arbitrary powers for the police, no 
less.  Things regarded as fundamental rights in England are forbidden in 
Ireland and become crimes. It will be the death-knell of the present 
Tories, whom I wouldn't have thought so stupid, and of the Unionist 
Liberals,127 whom I should hardly have thought so base. What's more, 
the Bill is to remain in force, not just for a time but for ever. The English 
Parliament has descended to the level of the German Reichstag. Not that 
it's likely to last very long. 
It will soon be time to publish Marx's letter to you about Henry 
George.128 Maybe after next November's elections in New York when 
George is again throwing his weight about there.129 He should be given 
enough latitude, either to develop further or to run to seed, the latter 
course being evidently the one he prefers. 
Another parcel will be going off to you. I have not yet had the last 
Commonweal; will follow shortly. 
I hope a rest in Rochester will soon put you to rights again. In this 
marvellous weather the enforced idleness, due to the condition of my 
eye, suits me very well. Let's hope it goes on like this.

ENGELS TO JOHN LINCOLN MAHON 130 
IN LONDON 
London, 23 June 1887 
Dear Mahon, 
I returned you yesterday the programme with some notes which may 
perhaps be of use at some future time.132 
What you say about the leaders of the Trades Unions is quite true. We 
have had to fight them from the beginning of the International. From 
them have sprung the Macdonalds, Burts, Cremers and Howells, and 
their success in the parliamentary line encourages the minor leaders to 
imitate their conduct. If you can get the Trades Unionists of the North 
to consider their Unions as a valuable means of organisation and of 
obtaining minor results, but no longer to regard 'a fair day's wage for a 
fair day's work' as the ultimate end, then the occupation of the leaders 
will be gone. 
I think your plan of organisation rather premature; the provinces 
ought first to be aroused thoroughly, and that is as yet far from being the 
case.  And unless there is an overwhelming force from the provinces 
brought to bear on London, the London squabblers will not be 
silenced—except by a real movement of the London masses. There has 

=====第93页=====
82 Letters -1887 
been in my opinion already too much impatience shown in what is called 
by courtesy the socialist movement in England; experimentalising with 
fresh attempts at organisation will be worse than useless until there is 
really something to organise. And when the masses once begin to move 
they will soon organise themselves. 
As to the League, if it upholds the resolution1 of the last Conference,95 
I do not see how anyone can remain a member who intends using the 
present political machinery as a means of propaganda and action. 
In the meantime it is necessary, of course, that the propaganda be 
kept up and I am quite willing to contribute my share. But the means 
for this must be got together and distributed by some English 
Committee, and as far as they are to come from London, by a London 
Committee. I shall speak to the Avelings about this and give them my 
contribution. 
I do not know any books where you could get information about the 
Luddite movement133; it will be a laborious task to trace out reliable 
sources from the references in history books and pamphlets of the time. 
Yours faithfully

Dear Sorge, 
Have received letters, etc., up to 16 June. 
I shall write and tell the Wischnewetzkys76 to word the note thus: 'to 
a See 'The Socialist League', The Commonweal, No. 73, 4 June 1887 

=====第94页=====
Letters-1887 83 
repudiate the silly calumnies to which Aveling has been exposed as a 
result of his American propaganda tour'.134 If they don't like that either, 
I shall tell them to refer to you and you may, if necessary, authorise them 
to delete the entire note. For I cannot possibly cite Aveling without 
saying a word about all that nonsense. 
Aveling sends the enclosed postcard re Time.135 The copies will have 
gone to Rochester. 
The business of Scribner's advertisement for Capital has the appear­
ance of a deliberate piracy.136  Thanks for the information; I shall pass it 
on to Sonnenschein. So far as I know, Scribner is not Sonnenschein's 
agent in New York. 
That the members of the Executive should have believed they had 
bought Liebknecht's silence with the electoral fundsa was predictable 
and not altogether unjustified. Luckily Liebknecht's first boastful letter 
had put him wholly in my power115 and of this, when he tried to with­
draw, I made the most determined use. 
Over here Hyndman has been continually defaming Aveling,103 in 
which he is strongly abetted by Aveling's reticence about such things. If 
we could catch the fellow out just once, he'd have cause to remember it. 
However, he is gradually bringing about his own demise. He's so 
wretchedly envious that he cannot tolerate a rival and is openly or 
secretly at war with all and sundry. And Aveling is at last eager for the 
fray and Tussy will see to it that he stays that way. 
You mustn't forget what I told you about la Schack. The creature 
wants to come back and is partout determined to cut a figure over here. 
So it's better to know exactly what she's up to. The affair between her 
and the Wischnewetzkys caused the Kautskys and Avelings much glee; 
may very well have had something to do with her going over to the 
Anarchists so as to prove that she had finished with us. Liebknecht 
writes to say that, in a letter to Dresden, she came out with the shock­
ing news that Aveling already had a previous wife from whom he was 
not divorced, and that he lived with Tussy without being married to 
her! So profound a secret is it in this country that any Englishman 
harbouring doubts on this score and desirous of making the Avelings' 
acquaintance, is informed of it by them in writing so that he cannot 
claim to have been kept in the dark and received under false pretences.

One day she was sentimentalising away to old Lenchen, saying how 
very much in love with one another the Avelings seemed to be, if only 
they always remained so, etc. 'Well, supposing they don't,' Lenchen 
burst out, 'they'll just part company again, and that will be that.' Which 
brought Madame Tittle-Tattle up sharp—she hadn't expected Lenchen 
to take such a practical view of things. 
I have written to Lafargue76  telling him to send the Socialiste to you 
at Rochester, but have had no reply. 
I trust the warm weather will put you to rights again. It is doing me a 
power of good. During these four weeks of drought I have had all my 
windows wide open and lived so to speak in the open air; I find it as 
good as a visit to a spa and am also hoping it will make my eyes better 
again. 
I am sick to death of Father McGlynn and George is turning out to 
be a proper founder of sects. Not that I really expected anything else; 
considering how recent the movement is, however, this was a transi­
tional stage that could hardly have been avoided. Such people must be 
given the length of their tether; the masses will learn only from the 
consequences of their own mistakes. 
I wish you a good recovery and good weather in Mount Desert!

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40

London,  15 July 1887 
My dear Laura, 
Thanks for your letters. I have Schorlemmer still here; a chronic 
catarrh of the stomach, the great heat, and the absence of a very pressing 
wish to revisit his dear country keep him here. Besides him, Fritz Beust 
from Zürich, whom you saw here eight years ago, has arrived too. So I 
must confine myself to urgent matters. 
I was obliged to give a card of introduction (to Paul) to a young Dr 
Conrad Schmidt of Königsberg, who dabbles in question sociale. He is 
about the greenest youth I ever saw, he was here about 3 months, seems 
a decent fellow, as decent fellows go nowadays, frisst keine Schuhnägel 
und säuft keine Tinte? If Paul deposits him in rue Richelieu, 
Bibliothèque nationale, he will not trouble him much. He admires Zola 
in whom he has discovered the 'materialistische Geschichtsanschauung \ h 
The Boulanger fit of paroxysm 137 ought to make our people demand 
again and again l'armement du peuple as the only guarantee against 
Caesaristic velleities on the part of popular generals. That is the only 
argument against the outcry of the Royalist press with regard to 
Boulanger being a danger to—the Republic they say, and the future 
monarchy they mean. 
Saturday week, 23 July, we move to Eastbourne, 4 Cavendish Place,138 
same as last year. If your Jersey trip is realised, let us know. I should not 
wonder if Tussy and Edward caught the Jersey fever.

IN LONDON 
Eastbourne, 26 July 1887 
4 Cavendish Place 
Dear Mr Mahon, 
Your postcard with address was forwarded to me here, hence the 
delay. 
If your letter means anything, it means that you intend, as far as you 
can, to shove Aveling entirely out of the movement.141 If you decline to 
work along with Aveling on public grounds, you are bound to come out 
with them, so as either to enable Aveling to clear himself or to free the 
movement from a dangerous and false co-operator. If not, then you are 
bound, in my opinion, to set aside your personal feelings in the interest 
of the movement. 
Of all the various Socialist groups in England, what is now the 'oppo­
sition' in the League,21 was the only one with which so far I could thor­
oughly sympathise. But if that group is allowed to fall to pieces from 
mere personal whims and squabbles, or from mutual suspicions and 
insinuations which are carefully kept away from the light of day, it can 
only dissolve into a number of small cliques held together by personal 
motives, and utterly unfit to take any sort of lead in a really national 
movement. And I do not see on what grounds I should sympathise with 

=====第99页=====
88 Letters-US7 
any of these cliques more than with another, or with the Social 
Democratic Federation62 or any other body. 
I have no right to ask you why you refuse to co-operate with Aveling. 
But as you have worked with him for years,142 he has, and therefore I 
consider myself bound to communicate your letter to him. 
Yours sincerely

Dear Kautsky, 
I return Mandl herewith; signature  overleaf. 143 I'm glad you like 
Ventnor. It is lovely here too, except for the Bank Holiday144 today, 
besides which Bax has set up his headquarters here for a week and cate­
chises me for an hour and a half every morning with the conscien­
tiousness of an American interviewer. Schorlemmer was here until last 
Saturday when he went off to Germany. F. Beust leaves on Thursday. 
So far as I remember, when dealing with the iron law of wages neither 
Mandl nor L. Frankel correctly emphasised its elastic rather than iron 
character.145  And, while Lassalle may sometimes formulate the law more 
or less correctly, 146 he is wont to apply it in practice in such a way as to 
declare the minimum wage to be the normal wage. 
It's very difficult to write here, with four people sitting at one's back, 
chatting and drinking beer. So good cheer and goodbye. 
Warmest regards from us all,

Dear Sorge, 
All postcards, letters and packages up to 27 July gratefully received, 
save for a few newspapers which are still in London and awaited daily. 
We have been here for a fortnight and shall be staying until about the 
25th of this month. 138 It's terribly hot, hardly a drop of rain since the 1st 
of June, in other words an American summer. There's only one remedy 
for your leg, rest and patience; then, with any luck, it will get well again, 
but at our age things of this sort always drag on for the devil of a long 
time. 
Let Monsieur Grunzig see what sort of a job he can make of a biog­
raphy of  myself. 148 You were quite right to leave the man to his own 
resources; who knows what rubbish he might not have written on the 
strength of your notes, only to cite you as his authority. Kautsky has 
written a biographical piece about me which is appearing in the Österre­
ichischer Arbeiter-Kalender 1^ and which I have read over, corrected and 
added to; hence, so far as the facts are concerned, it can serve for any 
future eventuality and I shall send it to you. Needless to say, I am not 
responsible for anything else that may be in it. 
I had to do most of the proof-correcting of Das Kapital I, 3rd ed., 
while ill in bed so that various mistakes slipped through. The punctua­
tion was deliberately altered to approximate to the French and English, 
as is now largely done in Germany. For that matter, the only place where 
the old pedagogic German of our boyhood days is still taught and writ­
ten is America. 
Aveling has told me that he himself sent you the copy of Time.89 But 
if only one halfpenny stamp too few is affixed to a parcel of books for 
abroad it will be withheld by the English post office. I shall make further 
inquiries on my return.—Aveling and Tussy are having a holiday at 
Stratford-on-Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace. 
The business of the Wischnewetzkys is becoming ever more of a 
joke. 149 In Germany an Executive such as this would have long since 
been removed from office. The chaps would seem to think that they can

afford to do anything, and that the party will stand by them through 
thick and thin in return for their requiring the Americans to place them­
selves under the command of a German society wherein sheer lubberli-
ness would appear increasingly to be gaining the upper hand. But if your 
Germans over there make that a condition for their co-operation, the 
movement will soon outdistance them. Things have at last got going in 
your part of the world and, unless I am much mistaken in my 
Americans, they will astonish us all by the magnificence of their move­
ment and also by the immensity of the blunders they will perpetrate, 
thereby ultimately clarifying their ideas. Pre-eminent when it comes to 
practice and still in swaddling clothes as regards theory—such is the 
situation, nor could it be otherwise; but at the same time a country with­
out any traditions (save religious) and with a democratic republic for its 
point of departure, and a people more abounding in energy than any 
other. The course of the movement will by no means follow a classic 
straight line but will zig-zag badly and at times appear to turn back on 
its tracks, though in America this will matter far less than it would over 
here.  Henry George was an unavoidable evil but will soon be consigned 
to oblivion, as will Powderly, not to say McGlynn, whose momentary 
popularity is understandable enough in so pious a country. In the 
autumn, a great deal will become—I wouldn't say clearer—but rather 
even more involved, as the crisis looms closer. The annual autumn elec­
tions are a real boon in that, over and over again, they impel the masses 
towards unity. 
Mount Desert is undoubtedly very beautiful, but this place isn't to be 
sneezed at either—long avenues of ancient elms and oaks right next the 
sea, the chalk cliffs of Beachy Head right next the town, which last has 
quite a continental air with its tree-lined promenades—if only I could 
again walk 4 or 5 miles (English ones)! 
I shall go on writing to Mount Desert from here up till about the 18th 
or 20th of August, and after that to Rochester unless instructed other­
wise. 
I am sending you the August number of To-day containing some 
comments, not altogether unfounded, on Aveling's circulars.150 The lad 
has brought all this down on his own head through his utter ignorance of 
the world, of men and of business, and his predilection for poetical dream­
ing. I, however, have woken him up a bit and Tussy will see to the rest. 
He's a very talented and serviceable sort of chap and thoroughly honest, 
but gushing as a flapper, with a perpetual itch to do something silly. Well, 
I can still recall the time when I was much the same kind of idiot.

In Paris our people are making a very brave stand against the chau­
vinists and Russophiles and, had it not been for them. La Justice wouldn't 
have dared to attack the Katkov cult.151 This is particularly important 
just now when Bismarck is doing everything in his power to chivvy the 
French into war152 before old Williama kicks the bucket. 
On the whole I am feeling better, as I hope you are.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
IN PARIS 
Eastbourne, 9 August 1887 
4 Cavendish Place 
My dear Laura, 
We have now been here more than a fortnight138  and nothing to 
complain of but the heat. This is indeed an exceptional summer as the 
sneaks in Nature call it: 'the Jubilee Anticyclone'. I have taken some 
light work with me for a rainy day but the rainy day will not come and 
the work remains fast asleep in my drawer. Jollymeier was here with us 
for a week and Fritz Beust a fortnight—he had to begin teaching again 
the day before yesterday in Zürich —there was considerable and quite 
undisguised flirtation between Pumps and him and nobody was prouder 
of it than Percy. Oh les maris! h 
a William I - b Oh, those husbands!

Whoever translated that preface of mine for the Socialiste 153 did it 
exceedingly  well.  I never was so well done in French. One or two passages 
make me suspect that it was done from the German, at least in part. 
The determined stand our people have made against Russophilism 
and Katkoffolatrie has evidently had a good effect. I see the Justice is 
coming round, and Kropotkin has tackled Rochfort. Guesde's article in 
l'Action shows that he knows more about the matter of Russia than I 
dared to hope for. 151 
Otherwise French, like all other, politics are under the influence of 
the hot weather. Tout rate, même les duels.* 154 
I hope that great Polish oculistb  will be the last and finally successful 
of Paul's panaceas. When he wrote before of operations, I thought they 
consisted in the opening out of the lachrymal duct, as this is the most 
common of all slight operations on the external eye. But most old men 
with watery eyes suffer from that rétrécissement, 0 and I am almost 
certain I have got it myself on one eye at least. But that I can get set right, 
if need be, in London, and before rushing into the arms and tools of that 
miraculous Pole, I shall await Paul's final report. There is nothing to give 
you such mountain-moving faith in individual doctors, as a general 
scepticism with regard to scientific medicine. 
I have had Bax here for a week and was daily interviewed by him with 
the regularity of a clock and the inquisitiveness of an American journalist. 
But it gave me an opportunity of quiet talk with him on many subjects, 
and when he has done with his set questions (which, as with most people 
here,  are meant to save them study) and has exhausted his sudden flashes 
of original ideas about le lendemain de la révolution^ and so on, he begins 
to talk sense and more sense than the preliminary conversation led you to 
expect. Then you find that after all he has a largeness of view that is but 
too scarce here amongst the sectarians calling themselves Socialists. But as 
to unacquaintance with the world that is, as to hermit-like simplicity and 
Fremdheit^ in the midst of the largest town of the world, an English 
Stubengelehrter^ beats his German compeer hollow. 
Paul's article on the services publics was very good.g  It would do good 
in Germany too, where the Vierecks and Co. are only too eager to use 
'Verstaatlichung^ in the same bamboozling way as Brousse and Co. the 
services publics.

Sunday evening all of a sudden Charley Rosher arrived—after ten. Had 
tricycled it—the hottest day of the season—from London; got to 
Haywards Heath (about 40 miles), done up, had to take the train. Next 
day diarrhoea and general breakdown. And on the following day, scarcely 
recovered, he had a telegram that his wife was ill and he was to return at 
once.  A subsequent telegram informed us that she had had a 'Miss Carry'. 
Nim was at first, while here, suffering from slight muscular rheuma­
tism—pains all over, as poor Lizzie a used to say—but she is all right now 
and very jolly. So is Pumps and her two children. Percy has to spend 
most of the week in London. I am lazy and give way to it, as being the 
best thing under the circumstances to do. And here comes the whole 
brigade ready for dinner and the children want me to make them paper 
boats,  so it's all up with writing and I close in haste.

Dear Bebel, 
Tomorrow or the day after you will be released from prison64 and I, 
for my part, hope to realise a plan which I have had in mind ever since 
you took up lodgings with the King of Saxony. Namely, to invite you to

make a short trip to London at my expense to help you recover from the 
wear and tear of martyrdom. But you must do me the favour of accept­
ing my proposal in its entirely, especially as regards it's being at my 
expense, for my conscience would not allow me to impose upon you any 
sacrifices, however small, in this connection. A holiday of this kind 
would seem to me absolutely essential to your health; you would at long 
last be able to breathe the air of liberty again, for over here the air is as 
free as it ever can be in a capitalist society. An abrupt transition from the 
narrow confines of Zwickau prison to the wider ones of the prison that 
is Germany would be altogether too hard. But I can think of nothing 
that is of more vital concern to the party now than your state of health, 
and therefore beg you to allow me to make my contribution to the party 
in the shape that seems to me most fitting. 
I shall be here for the next fortnight, i.e. shall return to London on the 
27th inst.1381 imagine it will take you roughly the same amount of time to 
put various matters in order, and I myself am unable to go back to town 
before then because my house is being refurbished from attic to cellar and 
everything is at sixes and sevens. But if you can come over any earlier and 
spend a few days with us here at the seaside, so much the better and the 
sooner the better. You can take the night boat from Flushing and travel to 
Victoria Station in London; the trains for Eastbourne leave from the same 
station and will get you here in 2 or 2x h hours. Kautsky, who returns to 
town from Ventnor on Monday (address 35 Lady Somerset Road, High-
gate,  London, N. W.), will gladly pilot you around London. Liebknecht, 
who also paid us a visit last year, was enthusiastic about the locality. 
So I eagerly await your answer and, provided this is in the affirmative 
and you are not coming straight away, shall send you an advance remit­
tance and thus make even more sure of you. 
All other discussions have best be left until we meet. So much has 
happened which you are better qualified than anyone else to explain to 
me. On the whole I am satisfied with the course the world has taken 
since you went into isolation; things are going ahead everywhere. 
Now I must close, for down here the post goes at 1.15 p.m. and if I 
miss it my letter won't leave London until Monday morning. I am 
addressing it for safety's sake to your wife, to whom, as to your daugh­
ter,3 kindly give my warmest regards.

Dear Kautsky, 
Please excuse the belated return of the enclosed, which I have read 
with thanks.155 I shall be interested to peruse the clean proofs of the 
More,a though I don't see of what help I can be to you in this. 
We shall be coming back on Saturday week, 27 August,138 by which 
time my house will presumably be habitable once more. 
If you happen to be passing Regent's Park Road I should be greatly 
obliged if you would drop in there and leave 3 or 4 large (long) 
envelopes, addressed to me here; I had left some there but they would all 
seem to have been used up. I mean the sort of envelope in which my 
people will be able to send me 3 or 4 letters at a time. 
For the rest, we are as merry as grigs and are expecting Sam Moore 
this evening. Last night we at last had a storm, but it's fine again now. 
Regards from my family to yours. The Avelings are at Stratford-on-
Avon, revelling in Shakespeariana at source.

ENGELS TO BRUNO SCHOENLANK 
IN NUREMBERG 
Eastbourne, 29 August 1887 
Dear Mr Schoenlank, 
Your letter, forwarded to me here by Kautsky, places me in something 
of a quandary. I read with interest the excerpts, published in the Neue 
Zeit, from your valuable work on the looking-glass industry and would 
not object on principle to your doing me the honour of dedicating the 
book to me. 156 But, in the first place, dedications are now rather out of 
fashion and, in the second, Marx and I have always felt a certain aversion 
to such more or less uncalled-for-tributes. And at present I happen to be 
in a frame of mind which makes me think my merits grossly overrated 
in some quarters. If one is so fortunate as to collaborate for forty years 
with a greater man and measure oneself against him day by day, one is 
given the chance of evaluating one's own achievements in accordance 
with a true standard. And I feel instinctively that to place any undue 
emphasis on my own activities is unwittingly to detract from what we all 
of us owe to Marx. 
Nor can I agree with you when you dub me the father of descriptive 
economics. You will find descriptive economics in Petty, Boisguillebert, 
Vauban, and Adam Smith, to name only a few. Such accounts, notably of 
proletarian conditions, were written by Frenchmen and Englishmen 
before I did mine. It was just that I was lucky enough to be precipitated 
into the heart of modern large-scale industry and to be the first whose 
eyes were opened to its implications—at any rate the most immediate 
ones.

Eastbourne, 30 August 1887 
Dear Bebel, 
I am tremendously glad that you are so willing to fall in with my little 
plan.a I shall expect to see you in London in the early part of October 
and only regret that you cannot come straight away and spend a week 
here in the bracing sea air. My house still being at sixes and sevens, I have 
had to stay here another week but we shall be going home on Friday, 2 
September.138 
Everything else I shall leave until we meet but, since you are going to 
Hamburg, just one more word. I have been corresponding with Wedde 
about a plan they have been hatching there. Unfortunately, however, I 
could not comply with his wishes since the plan—at any rate so far as I 
could judge from what Wedde told me—had been worked out in total 
ignorance of the law in this country and, more especially, of procedure 
in civil cases.157 Might I now ask you, when in Hamburg, to get Wedde 
to explain the whole plan in detail to you again so that we can discuss it

exhaustively over here, for if the thing is at all feasible, I would gladly do 
all I could, both for the sake of the cause and to oblige Wedde. If the worst 
comes to the worst and nothing can be done, I hope to convince you that 
such is really the case, and even this would mean quite a lot to me. 
So in about 3 or 4 weeks' time I hope to hear when you will be arriv­
ing. In the meantime please remember me most kindly to your wife and 
daughter.* With warmest regards,

hand over to Aveling who has just returned from the country to be 
distributed partly amongst the Socialist periodicals, partly at his East 
End Meetings at his lectures on the American movement.84 I shall also 
try through him to get an Agent for its sale and let you know the result. 
What I wrote about Trübner 3 has come true stronger than I expected. 
Yesterday Dr Baernreither, Austrian M.P., told me that he had asked 
Trübner —with whom he dealt regularly—to procure him a copy of our 
book. b Trübner said he had none, and that Dr Baernreither had better 
order it through an American Agency whose address he gave to 
Baernreither and through which Baernreither ordered the book. Thus 
Trübner not only boycotts but actually burns the book. 
As to the copies sent to Kautsky he could hardly act otherwise than he 
did.160  Neither Lovell nor yourself ever wrote him a line of instruction. I 
myself never heard whether any copies had been sent to the press here and 
to what papers. We were completely in the dark, and if the book has not 
got into the hands of the English press and not been noticed, that is 
entirely the fault of mistakes committed on your side of the water. Had I 
been informed of what had been done in that respect, or had I been told 
that that was left to me I could have acted. There is no doubt of a sale for 
it here, but not while it is in Trübner's hands; and if I was authorised to 
find an agent here I have no doubt of being able to do so; of course you 
would have to send a limited number of copies as a consignment. 
The repudiation of the Socialists by George161 is in my opinion an 
unmerited piece of good luck which will redeem to a great extent the— 
unavoidable—blunder of placing George at the head of a movement he 
did not even understand. George as the standard-bearer of the whole 
working-class movement was a danger; George as the Chief of the 
Georgeites will soon be a thing of the past, the leader of a sect like the 
thousands of sects in America. 
Your pamphlet on philanthropy'1 has not yet come to hand. 
Your translation of Marx's Free Trade speech I shall look over with 
pleasure and compare it with the French original of which I have 
perhaps the only copy extant. We will see about the preface later on. The 
7th Bemerkung^ from the Misere de la Philosophie would fit in very well.

deal of reference to Proudhon's notions in it, and I doubt whether Mr 
Tucker's lucubrations deserve any attention.162 
The reply of the Executive to my footnote is in itself so deprecatory 
and meaningless that to reply to it would be a work of supererogation.163 
I cannot reply in time for the Congress, and the fact remains that I have 
openly taken sides against the Executive in this matter. A fresh contro­
versy across the Atlantic can lead to nothing. As to the Sozialist and 
Volkszeitung boycotting me, I am sorry for it on account of the sale of 
the book and pamphlet, otherwise it is a matter of perfect indifference to 
me. I have got too often over such chicanery by simply waiting and 
looking on. 
Your expulsion I read in the Volkszeitung at the time, it was what was 
to be expected. I hope your pamphlet will come in time for the 
Congress, it would have been well if it had been out a month ago so as 
to come into the hands of the sections before they sent delegates. I am 
curious what the Congress will do but do not hope for too much. 
Faithfully yours

Fortunately the movement in America has now got such a start that 
neither George, nor Powderly nor the German intriguers can spoil or 
stop it. Only it will take unexpected forms. The real movement always 
looks different to what it ought to have done in the eyes of those who 
were tools in preparing it.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 121 
IN ROCHESTER 
London, 16 September 1887 
Dear Sorge, 
Letter of 1 September received. I hope your leg will gradually 
improve again; rest and patience, that's the main thing. 
This summer has been appallingly disrupted and my house full of 
visitors from all over the world, as it will continue to be until the middle 
of October since I am expecting Bebel in a fortnight's time. I shall not 
be able to look out Marx's letter about George128 until I can get things 
in order, i.e. until the new bookcases I have ordered arrive and provide 
me with more space. Then you shall at once have the translation. 
There's no hurry. Let George get himself into rather more of a fix. His 
repudiation of the Socialists161 is by far the best thing that could have 
happened to us. His elevation to the status of standard-bearer last 
November6  was a mistake that was unavoidable and was bound to have 
repercussions. For the fact remains that the masses can only be set in 
motion along a course—usually a circuitous one—appropriate to the 
country and the circumstances concerned. Everything else is of 
secondary importance, provided only they are galvanised into life. But 
on each occasion the penalty has to be paid for the blunders which 
inevitably ensue. Thus, it might have been feared in this instance that 
the elevation of the founder of a sect to the status of shield-bearer might 
have encumbered the movement with sectarian nonsense for years to 
come. By chucking out the founders of the movement, by constituting 
his sect a special, orthodox, Georgian sect, and by proclaiming his 
borné views to be the bornes 3 of the movement as a whole, George is 
saving the latter and ruining  himself. 
Needless to say, the movement as such still has many unpleasant 
phases to go through—unpleasant in particular for anyone who lives in 
the country and has to endure them. But I am absolutely convinced that 
things are now going ahead over there, and perhaps more rapidly than 
a limits

here,  despite the fact that, for the time being, the Americans will have to 
learn almost exclusively from practice, and relatively little from theory. 
The New York Executive's reply to my note is deplorable.163 Nor do I 
expect very much of their congress.164. The chaps in the east—the 
sections—don't seem to be up to much and yet there seems little likelihood 
of the Social Democratic Party's centre of gravity shifting to the west. 
The Trades Union Congress over here has again gone to show that a 
revolution is taking place within the old trades unions. It was resolved, 
in opposition to the leaders, notably Broadhurst, and to the other labour 
members of parliament, to form an Independent Labour Party.165 An 
armchair socialist and Austrian parliamentary deputy11 was quite amazed 
at the vast changes that had come about since he was last here in 1883. 
I haven't heard a word, or seen anyone, from France since Lafargue 
left for Jersey, where he is spending a week or two. 
I shall write to you about Germany as soon as I have discussed things 
over here with Bebel. 
As regards politics generally, everyone is getting ready for old 
William'sb death, whereupon the Russians will behave rather more cock-
ily in the East and Bismarck will egg them on in order to maintain his own 
position. But I hardly suppose it will come to a war. The uncertainty of 
what a war might entail is so great, the reciprocal intention of cabinets to 
betray each other so manifest, the certitude that the war would be more 
violent, bloody, costly and prostrating than any previous war (10 or 12

Dear Mr Koch, 
I have lately wasted so much time replying to anonymous tittle-tattle 
that I have made it a rule to reply only to such rumours as are substan­
tiated by those who spread them. Before I can reply to your query, 
therefore, I must ask you to tell me: 
1. To whom I am alleged to have made the remarks in question, 
2. who passed them on to you.

imagine without my expressly assuring you of the fact, I have for years 
been subjected to demands from every possible quarter—and not just 
Germany and England—in an ever increasing number of cases, these 
being for the most part cases from which, for private or party consider­
ations, I cannot possibly dissassociate  myself.  In this way I have 
contracted such a vast quantity of permanently recurring liabilities that 
I am myself in some perplexity—particularly at this moment—as to how 
I am to meet them. So much so, indeed, that were I now to tie up a sum 
such as you desire for, say, 2 or 3 years, I would patently find myself 
unable to meet those obligations into which I have already entered. This 
being so, I am forced to look at your proposal from a wholly busi­
nesslike point of view and this, unfortunately, leaves me no alternative 
but to say again how sorry I am that to comply with your wishes would 
be quite beyond my means. 
Trusting that you will succeed in obtaining the money in question

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40

London, 11 October 1887

rather anxious about news with regard to it.

I hope by this time you have settled down again, and are not too 
much disturbed by the precious scandals cropping up around you. This 
Caffarel affair168  seems to have been brought forward by the Rouvier-
Ferry lot, but if so it was a great mistake. It looks very much like the first 
scandals brought out by Girardin in 1846/47 and which led much farther 
than le rusé  Emile 11 expected. 169 The ball is once set rolling; and no doubt 
a good crop of further scandals will come to daylight. There are plenty 
of them going on behind the scenes and this single affair having been 
dragged forth, will frighten a lot of petty dabblers in the same kind of 
thing; in their anxiety to get out of danger they are sure to compel 
madame la justice to come forward, however reluctantly, and tackle the 
people who will be denounced by their frightened associates. Even this 
one affair bodes no good to the ruling lot; if Wilson is implicated, what 
is old Grévy to do? 
It would be a splendid piece of historical irony if the bourgeois 
republic was doomed to kill itself by the same révolutiondu  mépris* 0 
which swept away the bourgeois monarchy in 1848.17° 
The Raon-sur- Plaine affair was simply this: within Bismarck's empire 
this way of treating civilians is quite the rule with the military. 171 They 
are trained to it, and rewarded for it; and the cowardly bourgeois press 
praises such things if committed upon working men, and excuses them 
if committed upon bourgeois. And then it is of course impossible to 
drive into the same soldiers that on the frontier they must act differently, 
and that a Frenchman, a Russian or an Austrian is to be treated with 
more consideration. That drunken brute Kauffman will either be acquit­
ted or, if sentenced, for appearances' sake, to a nominal imprisonment, 
will be treated like le bon dieu en France^ and promoted hereafter. 
The Socialiste in its new shape is a considerable improvement upon 
the old one. 172 Paul could not do everything and his own articles look 
more worked out since he has not the whole burden upon his shoulders. 
It will do Deville good to contribute an article per week, his journalistic 
practice wanted developing and his articles are getting less ponderous. 
Next week I expect Bebel here173 and also probably Singer. Their 
Congress seems to have been a great success, and the right wing of the 
party have got a direct snub:174  Geiser and Viereck have been too 
cowardly to sign the Aufrufe for the Congress, and have consequently 
been declared incapable of further occupying eine Vertrauensstellung in

he will be more or less under Bernstein's care and go to Beust's school. 
Here things are moving slowly but they are moving. The Trades 
Union Congress was a splendid symptom.165 The Tories help us here by 
all sorts of little police chicanery with regard to open-air meetings— 
what confounded jackasses they are both here and in Ireland! 
Jackasses—unless they intend opening next parliament with the 
announcement that they have tried coercion and broken down and that 
nothing therefore remains but Home-Rule175—thus taking the wind out 
of Gladstone's sails and bringing in a half-and-half Home-Rule Bill of 
their own shaping. But I cannot think Salisbury has either so much sense 
or so much boldness. 
In the meantime Champion has openly attacked Hyndmanb in his 
paper Common Sense (rather Uncommon Nonsense) and the 
Fabians176 —a dilettante lot of egregiously conceited mutual admirers 
who soar high above such ignorant people as Marx—are trying to 
concentrate the 'movement' in their hands. Very nice amusements en

Clemenceau is a bourgeois and, as such, is closer to Ferry than to the

labour question was unknown—no longer exists, he must be in a curi­

My dear Laura, 
Nous voilà en plein  1847V-  The parallel is indeed striking; for Teste 
read: Wilson, for Emile de Girardin read: A. E. Portalis; and if Grévy is 
not an exact counterpart of Louis Philippe, he is a very well got-up 
combination of both Louis Philippe and Guizot, uniting the money-
greed of the first with the false dignity of the other. 181 I have devoured 
this morning the papers Paul was good enough to send me, and thought 
myself forty years younger. Only that the république bourgeoise beats 
the bourgeois monarchy in out-and-out in cheek. Girardin's study was

never broken into nor was his head smashed, and the wholesale suppres­
sion of documents seized by police and  parquet** 1*2 has no counterpart 
in 1847. But all these tricks will be useless, the ball is set a-rolling and roll 
on it will. What we see now is only the 'exposition' of the drama which 
seems likely to be as creditable to the innate dramatic genius of French 
history as any of its predecessors. 
The most important feature is that this commencement de la fin de la 
république bourgeoise^ does not come alone. In Russia, too, the end 
seems near. The ever-repeated promises of an energetic and successful 
policy with regard to Bulgaria, followed by ever-renewed checks and 
moral defeats, seem to have again united the various elements of opposi­
tion—it looks as if there might soon be a crisis. Then there is Unser 
Fritz 0 with a now undeniable cancer in his throat—if anything happens 
to him, the successor to Old William will be a dummer schnoddriger 
Junge, d of the Gardelieutenant type, at present an adorer of Bismarck 
but sure soon to fall out with him because he will want to command; a 
fellow who will soon drive things to extremes and upset the present 
alliance between feudal nobility and bourgeoisie by sacrificing the latter 
entirely to the former and who even in army matters is almost sure to fall 
out with the old experienced generals. And then a crisis is certain. Thus, 
the critical point is coming nearer everywhere, and I only hope that 
everywhere people will find as much work cut out for them at home as 
to prevent them from rushing into war. 
La belle Limouzin alias Scharnetm  is indeed a beauty of a peculiar 
kind to fascinate French officers. But then, she aimed at nothing less than 
generals, and generals are people of a certain age when tastes begin to be 
uncertain with some people. It is certainly a very queer new edition of 
the Victoires et conquêtes de l'armée française^ —the conquest of a 
hunchbacked, lame, repulsive old hag from Karlsruhe! Anyhow she 
looks energetic and has roused Thibaudin to a rare enthusiasm. 
The stories you tell me about the men of the agglomération^ are char­
acteristic too. 184 The transformation of Paris into a Luxusstadtf under 
the Second Empire could not help telling on the working-class too. But 
any serious movement will shake off a good deal of that. The effect upon 
the intellect of the masses, I am afraid, will be more lasting.

Tomorrow we shall have here a bit of a tussle too. After a deal of hesi­
tation and vacillation the police have at last forbidden all meetings on 
Trafalgar Square; the Radical Clubs have answered by calling a great 
meeting thither for to-morrow afternoon.185 Tussy and Edward are of 
course bound to go. I do not anticipate a serious collision. But it is just 
possible that Matthews and his colleagues of the Tory government for 
once show fight; especially as the daily Liberal press have taken the side 
of the police, and as there is no general election in sight just now, as was 
the case at the time of the Dod St affair.186 If so, there may be a scrimmage 
and a few arrests. So you better look out for tomorrow evening's papers. 
I must shut up now, it's past five and no time to lose if you are to have 
this letter to-morrow morning. So good-bye. Nim keeps cutting her

about seven o'clock, her coat in tatters, her hat crushed and torn by a 
blow from a  staff,  having been arrested by bobbies but released on the 
orders of an inspector; practically no one was held and Edward got 
through unscathed, the contingent he was with having done a bunk at 
the very outset.185 
The case is to be heard in the courts and it remains to be seen whether 
the jury endorses Matthews' famous doctrine which holds that any 
person walking in Trafalgar Square without the Crown's permission is a 
trespasser. The Liberals, from Gladstone to Labouchere and Bradlaugh, 
are begging the people to leave the question in abeyance since it is to be 
settled in court. But so exasperated have the working men been by police 
brutality that there may well be another clash next Sunday. Then— 
provided, that is, that nothing unforseen happens—there'll be another 
rout, Trafalgar Square being the place most favourable to the govern­
ment. It is easily defended, can be approached from the east only by 
narrow streets, is far removed from the abode of the working class and 
is situated at the heart of the shopping centre, with barracks close by and 
with St James's Park—in which to muster reserves of troops—a stone's 
throw away from the field of battle. Since your philistine, both of the 
bourgeois and the working-class variety, is in favour of constitutional 
action, it is to be expected that the next demonstration will be too  half­
hearted to attempt anything serious. In which case it would be a shame 
to see the best elements sacrifice themselves to preserve the honour of 
the chicken-hearted who are now pulling out. 
And in France? If you get Ferry in place of Grévy, not only will you 
get a thief of a son-in-law in place of a father-in-law who is at worst a 
fence; you'll get a son-in-law who's a thief of the first water. 168 For what 
Wilson has stolen throughout a whole lifetime does not amount to 
anything like the sum stolen by Ferry during the Tunis affair alone. To 
admit the possibility—even pro tern—of such a dénouement seems to me 
too incompatible with the dramatic genius of French history. Rather 
than a solution, it would be intrigue at its most extreme and tending 
towards a crisis. And, from that point of  view,  Ferry's accession is almost 
to be wished for—the accession of the head of the firm of Roublard & 
Co. in place of humble clerk. Grévy, for having merely turned a blind 
eye to corruption, toppled by Ferry who indulges in it openly and boasts 
of so doing—that would be fine! But Ferry as President—that would be 
a call to revolution: the bourgeoisie's 'I don't give  a fig for you!' flung in 
the face of the people. 
As for peace, no one but a fool would try to end it just now. The

Crown PrinceV cancer would be enough to restrain any warlike 
impulses Bismarck might feel; the Central Alliance, with England in 
reserve, is strong enough to ward off, almost effortlessly, any Franco-
Russian attack. On the other hand, an offensive war against France with 
her newly entrenched positions, and against vast and impoverished 
Russia, would present more problems than pleasures. The impossibility 
of a true alliance between the Tsarb and the Republic, both of whose 
governments are manifestly labile, becomes increasingly evident. In 
Russia, even the Slavophiles187  are turning against the internal system of 
government. One of their leading men, Lamansky, openly says that the 
obstacle to the march on Constantinople does not lie in Vienna or in 
Berlin but in a system of government which prevents the Russians from 
attaining the same intellectual level as the West and thus becoming 
worthy of the rôle of leading Slav nation. All things considered, coups de 
tête c on the part of both Petersburg and Paris are to be anticipated. It 
remains to be seen what the Tsar will do at Berliin after the public slap 
in the face he has just received from Bismarck via the Imperial Bank of 
Germany. 188 
As for your army, the soldiers with 2 or 3 years' service have not yet 
been used against the people, hence it is impossible to say how they 
might conduct themselves. But they are no longer the undisciplined 
troops of the Empire. One would have to know how the regiments are 
constituted, from what regions they are recruited, and whether there are 
many Parisians in their ranks. 
By the way, has the Socialiste again succumbed? My last number is

getting bourgeois. 
It is a misfortune that overtakes all extreme parties as soon as the day 
for them to become 'possible' draws near. But ours cannot go beyond a 
certain limit in this respect without betraying its own cause, and it seems 
to me that in France as in Germany we have now reached that point.

ENGELS TO CONRAD SCHMIDT 
IN KÖNIGSBERG 
London, 26 November 1887 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Dr Schmidt, 
I was delighted to hear from you again and to learn that you had left 
behind the fogs of London and the exuberant air of Paris and were 
back in the atmosphere of 'pure reason'. I had learned from the press 
about the strange adventures connected with the arrival of your crate 
of books190  and imagined I was back again in those long-forgotten days 
when I myself was in Berlin, an occasional contributor to the 
Hartungsche Zeitung, 3- and when everything was banned save a 
'narrow slave mentality'. 191 But no doubt there are even better things 
in store! 
As regards Heine's letter, I cannot throw any definite light on it.192 
Up till 1848 Lassalle cut no sort of political figure at all; he became 
known only as a result of the Hatzfeldt trial. 193 And in it both parties 
had recourse to all possible means, no matter what, provided they gave 
promise of success, and brought into play, whenever and however they 
thought fit, anyone who might conceivably be of use. On the other 
hand, the ban placed by the Federal Diet on Heine's books, even future 
a Königsberger Hartungsche  Zeitung 

=====第129页=====
118 Letters-1887 
ones,  forced him to use all available methods of advertisement in order 
to ensure the sales that he would otherwise have automatically enjoyed. 
In the circumstances, Lassalle could become most useful to Heine; on 
the other hand, Heine was impressed by his energy, ruthlessness and 
knowledge of the world—all things rare in the majority of young 
Germans then as they are today. 
So it is more than probable that Lassalle sought to make use of Heine 
for the benefit of the Countess, and the letter in question almost 
certainly relates to some aspect of the case—very probably the casket. 
Whether la Meyendorf was in Paris at the beginning of 1846, I cannot 
say for certain but, from what I remember of the proceedings, I think she 
was. Either the proceedings in the casket case of 1846, or those in 
Lassalle's of 1848 should provide a clue (best source Kölnische Zeitung). 
If she was in Paris, it was doubtless for the purpose of making an attempt 
on the casket. Heine and I never discussed Lassalle, whom neither Marx 
nor I knew at that time. 
Your fellow-townsman Weiss came to see me here; has gone to Berne 
to complete his studies." 
A fortnight ago we had a rumpus of our own over here during which 
Mrs Aveling became involved in a scuffle with the police without, 
however, coming to any serious harm.185 The fact is that our Tory 
government's stupidity is such as almost to rival Puttkamer's. If old 
Disraeli were to rise up out of his grave, he would lambast these school­
boys good and proper. 
May I thank you in advance for the article you promised to send 
me. 194 
Recently I was called upon by Herkner, a quite intelligent man when 
one comes to converse with him, and a good deal more radical than his 
book.b  He seemed very anxious to impress upon me that in reality even 
Brentano is, at heart, less tame than he makes himself out to be in his 
books. Indeed, if the gentlemen at German universities only had the 
courage of their convictions, we should at any rate be as far on as we 
were in 1837 and 1840. But whether, in that case, they would find an 
audience is questionable to say the least. 
Otherwise, everything goes jogging on in the same old way over here, 
so there's nothing new to report.

ENGELS TO NATALIE LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 29 November 1887 
Dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
Thank you and Liebknecht very much indeed for your good wishes 
on the occasion of my birthday, which we celebrated yesterday. A whole 
lot of people foregathered; there had first been, in the evening, a 
rehearsal in a public house of  a French play adapted by Aveling, in which 
he and Tussy both acted and met with great applause, as did the play 
itself,  which has been accepted by a popular actress and hence is now 
more or less assured of success. Afterwards, the whole company 
repaired to my house; Lenchen had made some doughnuts and pretzels 
and Mrs Kautsky a Viennese apple-tart, while midnight ushered in 
Aveling's birthday, so that we were able to celebrate that as well. 
Percy* would undoubtedly have come to see you in Leipzig, but he was 
making only a brief business trip to Dresden and Berlin and had to get 
back as soon as possible because his buttonholing machine was to figure 
in an exhibition here which was remaining open only until last Saturday. 
He arrived in Leipzig in the middle of the night, had to stop there a few

hours after missing his connection and left again that same morning for 
Dresden. Otherwise he would not have failed to pay you his respects. 
As far as Mrs Schack is concerned, she has, to my knowledge, 
declared on three separate occasions that all the German deputies in our 
party are corrupt and, on two of those occasions, expressly included the 
names of Liebknecht and Bebel. a After she had done this, it was impos­
sible for me to have any further dealings with her, even if she herself had 
made the first move, which was certainly not the case. Bebel had an 
opportunity of seeing her in her new role and seemed in no way edified 
thereby. Liebknecht likewise had that opportunity at St Gallen, 174 she 
having had the, to my mind, unbelievable impertinence to go there. 
What she told him while there I, of course, don't know, but it cannot 
alter the fact that she spoke about him over here in such a way as, in my 
eyes,  to constitute a complete breach. The creature is absolutely deter­
mined to cut a figure and if, after what has happened, Liebknecht should 
help her in any way, whether direct or indirect, to do so, or if he should 
allow his behaviour to be governed by the moderate attitude you have 
described, there would be a danger that his enviers, of whom we all have 
our fair share, would look for other motives for his actions. Of course, 
you and Liebknecht must know best what attitude you should adopt 
towards the woman. I, for my part, am glad to be rid of her. 
In her conflict with the powers that be, Tussy came to no harm, unlike 
her coat and hat which were irretrievably damaged. As a matter of fact she 
wasn't attacked; rather it was she who did the attacking. Now the rumpus 
is virtually over and, while some trifling incident may be staged in Trafalgar 
Square, it will only be for fun. But the government will have something to 
think about. Were old Disraeli to know what dunderheads his successors 
were, he'd rise up out of the grave and lambast them good and proper. 
I am tolerably well again and so is Lenchen. She and the Roshers, 
ditto the Kautskys and Avelings, send you and your husband their 
cordial regards. 
Very sincerely yours, 
F. Engels

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN ROCHESTER 
[London, November 1887] 
Dear Old Man, 
Have received and burned the letter concerned. Had a shrewd idea 
that the isolation of Rochester wouldn't suit you. In a little hole like that 
one even misses the irritation of seeing the movement ruined by inept 
would-be big wigs and business men on the make. But perhaps you'll get 
used to it. Being in business is, after all, no more boring than teaching 
music to lazy, recalcitrant pupils. One gets used to counting-house 
chores; I had to do them for close on thirty years,9 though I must say I'm 
glad to be quit of them. Well, let me know honestly how you get on. 
Your old friend,

Socialist literature, has undertaken the sale of the book.a He writes 
December 1: 
'Regarding our conversation of to-day (Wednesday) in reference to 
the agency of The Condition etc. by Engels we shall be pleased to under­
take the same and have copies from you or the publisher in America b at 
the rate of 3s. net bound—the future copies should be sent unbound. 
The sole charge will be the necessary printing of titles and insertion of 
same which will cost about 10s.' 
And further, December 2: 
'In answer to your enquiry as to date of making up accounts we beg 
to say that every six months is the time and payment made a month after. 
We understand until other arrangements are made we are dealing with 
you.' 
This latter proviso I made as otherwise Reeves could have evaded 
settlement of accounts by saying he did not know whom to pay, Mr 
Lovell or  myself,  and then cause delay and procrastination. In future 
transactions other arrangements can be made. As to these he writes 
December 1st: 
'The rates for other works similar in character could be taken at about 
the same rate of discounts—it depends a little on the price to be put on 
for retail price, for instance a 6s.- book is supplied to the trade at a little 
cheaper rate than a 5s.- one.' 
So the fellow will keep a door open for haggling and in future cases it 
will be well to inform me in time, so as to arrange definitely his discount 
before you put his name on the title as London agent. These people are 
all alike. 
The above terms are of course for books delivered to him carriage 
paid and free of all expense on his part. He says the carriage is but trifling 
and so it may be to the trade and for bales, but I know that for parcels 
sent to private people they stick it on pretty well; Kautsky had to pay 
above 10s for the copies sent to him, and the Liverpool agent (Wheatley) 
made me pay 2s.6d. extra expenses on the parcel containing the 1,000 
pamphlets,0 altho' no carriage whatever was charged to me.

Commonweal (I sent a copy to Morris) has begun a series of extracts 
from the book,195 the first of which I mailed to you to-day. Altogether 
the prospects are very good. Only we must not send the copies to the 
press until after Christmas, otherwise they would be wasted. 
As to the pamphlet,a as I told you, Reeves had it pirated and will of 
course sell his own lot first. I shall hand the 1,000 copies to Aveling to 
do the best he can—either sell at meetings or give to Reeves as he may 
want them; but I am afraid a good deal of them will have to be given 
away gratis in the long run at meetings. 
Your translation of Free Trade shall have attention as soon as ever 
possible.196 I shall also write a preface, only I am sure it will not in any 
case be what you want. It is impossible for me to answer the probable 
arguments of American protectionists beforehand. I do not know that 
sort of literature and have no time to go into it. My reasoning in nine 
cases out of ten would miss the mark, and moreover whatever we may 
say, they will always find a way out, and have something to say that 
we cannot foresee. To enter into polemics with them directly, one 
must be in America. And I have always found that a good book makes 
its way and has its effect whatever the penny-a-liners of the day may 
say.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 
IN PARIS 
London, 5 December 1887 
My dear Lafargue, 
Like you, I cried 'VictoryI' yesterday morning. It is clear that, had it 
not been for the people of Paris, the Right would not have dreamed of 
voting for an impossible candidate3 and would have rallied to Ferry with 
the opportunists-cum-speculators.197 In which case—battle and, as 
likely as not, defeat. 
The drama is unfolding in complete accordance with the rules. In 
1878 victory of the people and the army over the monarchists alone;198 
in 1887 victory over the monarchists and opportunists199 combined. The 
next victory must be victory over monarchists, opportunists and 
radicals200 combined. 
Clemenceau would seem after all to have contributed not a little to 
that result by dropping Freycinet in favour of Carnot. It was the least he 
could do after falling headlong into Ferry's trap. But it's better than 
nothing. And, circumstances being what they are, a legal solution of this 
kind, brought about under the menacing pressure of the Parisian work­
ers, is all we might wish. As in the case of most days during the great 
revolution, it is a period of ascent. 
What attitude did the soldiers adopt—those of the line, I mean? 
Peaceful victories such as this are a capital way of familiarising troops 
with the supremacy and infallibility of the popular masses. Another day 
or two of the same sort and the troops will undoubtedly mutiny. 
Sadi Carnot won't do much. The presidency is done for after what has 
happened. The president has been reduced to a puppet, appointing and 
dismissing ministers at the command of the Chamber. 
All the same, I hope the scandals will continue to be relentlessly 
followed up. Things have gone too far, I think, to be halted now. The 
bourgeois will cry that enough is enough, that one should display 
generosity and let bygones be bygones—but let us hope that the

We shall have to omit the Neue Rheinische Zeitung article/ for in the 
first place it would today require an additional explanatory section 
(because of our Russian friends) and, in the second, I intend at some later 
date to bring out a collection of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung articles by 
Marx and  myself.  We might discuss this later on. 202 
Herewith The Bakuninists at Work with the paragraphs in Section III 
correctly numbered in the order in which they should appear. Would 
you kindly send this sheet for me to look at, so that I know what I'm 
about. The remaining proof reading can be attended to over there. 
If you could get hold of one or two copies of the Revue of the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung (complete), I will gladly pay for them. I have only 
got vols 3, 5 and 6, and should like to have 1, 2 and 4 as well.

without an introduction and wouldn't be time-consuming; 3.1 have sold 
the Prussian Military Question to Meissner, with whom I cannot start a 
row, and much of what I say in it would be very difficult to understand 
today without a commentary. 
After the New Year I shall have to tackle Volume III of Das Kapital, 
for which I must spare my eyes. Aside from what I have already under­
taken, therefore, I can at present do absolutely nothing for you; I'm 
very sorry, but I have no alternative. As soon as this ms. has gone to 
press,  and while correcting the proofs, I shall have time to spare for you, 
provided my eyes are all right again. But you must remember that I can 
only really write for a few hours each day and then only by daylight—

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
IN PARIS 
London, 29 December 1887 
My dear Lafargue 
I held back my reply until today when I should have received more 
precise information from Kautsky about the worthy Oberwinder. I 
knew about the business in general terms, but I wanted to be sure.204 
After 1873 Oberwinder played a fairly important part in the Viennese 
movement. He was an erstwhile Lassallean, and editor of the Volkswille, a 
weekly paper. At that time, the deputies to the Austrian parliament were 
elected by the provincial diets, and the Liberals were agitating for direct 
election by the districts. Oberwinder espoused their cause with a fervour 
all the more disinterested for his being in the pay of the Liberals—through 
an intermediary, a Mr Szeps of the Neue Wiener Tagblatt. On the pretext 
that the Liberals' demand was the first step towards universal suffrage, he 
urged the workers to support them. Scheu opposed this, but in Vienna 
Oberwinder had a majority and compelled Scheu and his friends to secede; 
the latter, who had a majority in the provinces, founded Die Gleichheit in 
Wiener Neustadt and used their journal to attack Oberwinder in all kinds 
of ways,  reproaching him for the above-mentioned activities and for other 
things besides. Oberwinder brought a libel action against Scheu, but the 
jury found that Scheu had proved his case and acquitted him. In the course 
of the proceedings it was further established that Oberwinder had 
expended on his weekly paper the sum of 10,000 florins (25,000 francs) 
subscribed towards the founding of a daily, and had done other things of 
a similar nature. In short, the case ruined Oberwinder's position in Vienna 
and the Liberals could have no further interest in paying him. He went to 
Hamburg where he associated with the Breuerist group of Lassalleans— 
one of those sects in which moribund Lassalleanism was ending its days. 
Its members were out-and-out petty bourgeois and their sect has been 
extinct for ten years or more. Next, Oberwinder came to Paris. About a 
year ago he published a pamphlet" in which he called on the German 
workers to rally to Bismarck's policy and support him so that he, in 
return, should grant them social reforms. 
a H. Oberwinder,  Sozialismus  und Sozialpolitik,  Berlin, 1887 

=====第141页=====
130 Letters -1887 
As you can see, he's a Lassallean who can say he has never betrayed 
his own opinions. 1) He believes in the omnipotence of universal 
suffrage, which is why he supported the Austrian Liberals; 2) Lassalle 
demanded that, in the struggle between royalty and the bourgeoisie, the 
workers should side with royalty—and that is why Oberwinder is a 
partisan of Bismarck's. Seeing that Lassalleanism is extinct in Germany, 
why should not this erstwhile Lassallean take Bismarck's money just as 
he had taken it from the Austrian Liberals? Except that, once he had 
drawn his first Bismarckian penny, he must have realised he was dealing 
with one more wily than himself and that he was trapped. 
The discovery made by our people in Switzerland11  may be of the 
utmost importance—the Swiss authorities will do all in their power to 
compromise Prussia, and the Geneva affair—a nihilist plot—will have 
repercussions. It is typical of the stupidity of the Prussian  police!  The said 
Haupt, caught red-handed by a handful of intrepid workers who, while 
searching his house—which he allowed them to do!—discovered his 
correspondence with Krüger —the Haupt is such a muffzs to admit having 
been an informer for the past seven years! And that's the man to whom 
they entrust a mission of this kind! After that, the suborning of Nonne 
and Oberwinder surely comes as no surprise. But as Heine always used to 
say: the Prussian informers are the most dangerous because they are not 
paid but always live in hopes, which makes them active and intelligent; if 
Prussia were to pay them, they would no longer be good for anything. 
I hope that the Pucks and Judges sent off yesterday have reached 
Laura.b 
That your protégé Stead is very useful just now, no one will deny, but 
it doesn't prevent this man, who defends in Russia what he attacks in 
Ireland, from living in a century which is not our own. You ought like­
wise to take the Salvation Army 205 under your wing for, without it, the 
right to hold processions and discussions in the street would be in a far 
more parlous state in England than it now is. 
Nim, Jollymeier, Pumps and the little ones have gone to the theatre to 
see Hans the Boatman, an American play in which there are lots of chil­
dren and a large dog.

ENGELS TO ION NADEJDE 
IN JASSY 
London, 4 January 1888 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Citizen, 
My friend Karl Kautsky, editor of the Neue Zeit, has sent me several 
consecutive numbers of La Revista Sociala and of Contemporanul 
containing, amongst other things, your translations of some of my 
works, in particular my Origin of the Family, etc. 207 Allow me to  prof­
fer my sincere thanks for the trouble you have been so good as to take 
in making these writings accessible to the Romanian public. In addition 
to the honour you have thus done me, you have also rendered me, 
personally, the service of enabling me at long last to learn something of 
your language. I say at long last because, almost fifty years ago, I tried 
to do this, if in vain, with the help of the Grammaire comparée des 
langues romanes* by Diez. Recently I succeeded in getting hold of 
Cionca's little grammar but, having no texts to read and no dictionary, 
I did not get on very well. But with your translation I have been able to 
make some progress, the original text and the Latin and Slav etymology 
having taken the place of the dictionary and now, thanks to you, I can 
say that Romanian is no longer, for me, a completely unknown 
language. However, if you could tell me of a passable dictionary, 
whether Romanian-German or Romanian-French or -Italian, you 
would be doing me another signal service; for it would help me the

better to understand your original articles and the pamphlets Ce vor 
socialistii romîni? and Karl Marx si economistii nostri, which Kautsky 
likewise sent me. 208 
From these I have, with much pleasure, gained the conviction that the 
socialists of your country have adopted in their programmea the funda­
mental principles of the theory formulated by my late friend Karl 
Marx—a theory which has succeeded in welding together into a single 
fighting force the vast majority of European and American socialists. At 
the time of that great thinker's death, the social and political situation, 
and the progress being made by our Party in all civilised countries, 
enabled him to close his eyes in the conviction that his efforts to unite 
the proletarians of the two worlds into one big army and under the same 
flag would ultimately be crowned with success. But if only he had been 
able to catch a glimpse of the immense strides we have since made in 
America no less than in Europe! 
So great have been those strides that, for the European party at any 
rate, a common international policy has become imperative. In this 
regard, I again have the satisfaction of seeing that you agree, in principle, 
with ourselves and with the large majority of western socialists. Your 
translation of my article 'The Political Situation in Europe', as also your 
letter to the Editor of the Neue Zeit, are proof enough of this. 
Indeed we are all confronted by the same great obstacle that is 
hampering the free development of all the nations and of each individual 
nation; in the absence of that development we could not embark upon, 
still less accomplish, social revolution in the various countries merely by 
means of mutual cooperation. That obstacle is the old Holy Alliance209 
between the three assassins of Poland, led since 1815 by Russian Tsarism 
and surviving until today despite occasional domestic squabbles. It was 
founded in 1815 to combat the revolutionary spirit of the French people; 
in 1871 it was ratified by the annexation of Alsace, which turned 
Germany into the slave of Tsarism and the Tsar into the arbiter of 
Europe; in 1888 it is maintained for the purpose of crushing the revolu­
tionary spirit within the three empires—the national aspirations no less 
than the political and social movements of the working classes. Since 
Russia enjoys a virtually impregnable strategic position, Russian Tsarism 
forms the nub of that alliance, great repository of all European reaction. 
To topple Tsarism, to destroy that incubus which lies heavy on the

whole of Europe, such, in my eyes, is the first condition for the eman­
cipation of the nationalities of central and eastern Europe. Once Tsarism 
has been crushed, the nefarious power represented today by Bismarck 
will in turn crumbled Austria will fall to pieces, having lost its only 
raison d'être, that of preventing by its very existence the annexation by 
conquering Tsarism of the scattered nations in the Carpathians and the 
Balkans. Poland will be reborn, Little Russia will be free to choose its 
political position, the Romanians, the Magyars and the South Slavs will 
be able to settle their own affairs and their new boundaries amongst 
themselves, unhampered by any foreign meddling and, finally, the noble 
nation of Great Russia, no longer engaged in pursuing chimerical 
conquest for the benefit of Tsarism, will be free to carry out its true civil­
ising mission in Asia and to develop its vast intellectual resources in 
exchanges with the West, instead of squandering the best of its blood on 
the scaffold or in the katorga. h 
You in Romania must know what Tsarism is, having had more than 
enough experience of it through Kiselev's 'règlement organique', 
through the intervention of 1848, through the theft—perpetrated not 
once,  but twice—of Bessarabia, 210 through the innumerable invasions of 
your country, a mere Russian staging-post, no more, on the way to the 
Bosphorus, and through the sure knowledge that your independent exis­
tence will cease on the day the Tsar fulfils his dream—the conquest of 
Constantinople^ 
At this moment the alliance appears to have disintegrated and war 
to be imminent. But even if war does come, it will be merely in order 
to make recalcitrant Prussia and Austria toe the line. I hope that peace 
will be maintained: in such a war it would be impossible to sympathise 
with any of the combatants; rather, were such a thing possible, one 
would wish that all should be beaten. It would be a terrible war—but, 
come what may, everything will eventually turn to the advantage of 
the socialist movement and bring nearer the accession of the working 
class. 
Pray excuse these elucidations, but just now I could not well write to 
a Romanian without expressing an opinion on these burning questions.

ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 211 
IN ST PETERSBURG 
London, 5 January 1888 
Dear Sir, 
I have removed and my new address is: Mrs Rosher, Cottesloe, 
Burton Road, Kilburn, London N. W. There is no number, Cottesloe 
being the name of the house. 
I have at once ordered from my bookseller here the work of Dr 
Keussler. b Even if the first volumes are based on imperfect materials I 
have seen enough of the work of your Zemstvos to know that the 
résumé of them must contain immensely valuable material and, being 
written in German, prove a perfect revelation to Occidentals. 212 I shall 
take good care that these materials are made use of. 
I am afraid your land-bank for the nobility213 will have about the

same effect as the Prussian land-banks have had. There the nobility 
took up loans under pretext of improving their estates, but really spent 
most of the money in keeping up their habitual style of living, in 
gambling, trips to Berlin and the provincial chefs-lieux 3 etc. For the 
nobility considered it their first duty standesgemäss zu lebend and the 
first duty of the state seemed to them to enable them to do so. And so, 
in spite of all banks, of all the enormous direct and indirect money-
presents made to them by the state, the Prussian nobles are over head 
and ears indebted to the Jews, and no raising of the import duties on 
agricultural produce will save them. And I remember one well-known 
half-German Russian, attached illegitimately to the Russian nobility, 
finding these Prussian nobles still too stingy. When, on arriving from 
one shore to another, 0 he saw them at home he exclaimed: why these 
people try to save money while with us a man would be considered the 
meanest of the mean unless he spent half as much again as his income! 
If this be really the principle of the Russian nobility,d then I wish them 
joy of their banks. 
The peasants' bank214 too seems similar to the Prussian peasants' 
banks,  and it is almost inconceivable how difficult it is for some people 
to see that all fresh sources of credit opened up to landed proprietors 
(small or large) must result in enslaving them to the victorious 
capitalist. 
My eyes still require des ménagements? but anyhow I hope in a short 
time,  say next month, to be able to resume my work on the 3rd volume f; 
unfortunately I cannot as yet make any promises as to the time of finish­
ing it. 
The English translation? has sold and is selling very well, indeed 
surprisingly well for a book of that size and class; the publisher11 is 
enchanted with his speculation. The critics are on the other hand very, 
very much below the average low level. Only one good article in the 
Athenaeum^7; the rest either merely give extracts from the preface or, if 
trying to tackle the book  itself,  are unutterably poor. The fashionable 
theory just now here is that of Stanley Jevons,215  according to which 
value is determined by utility, i.e. Tauschwert-Gebrauchswert' and on

the other hand by the limit of supply (i.e. the cost of production), 
which is merely a confused and circuitous way of saying that value is 
determined by supply and demand. Vulgar Economy everywhere! 
The second great literary organ here, the Academy, has not yet 
spoken. 
The sale of the German edition of I and II volumes goes on very well. 
There are a great many articles written about the book and its theories, 
an extract, or rather independent reproduction in: Karl Marx's 
Ökonomische Lehren von a K. Kautsky, not bad, though not always 
quite correct, I will send it you. Then a miserable apostate Jew Georg 
Adler, Privatdozent in Breslau, b has written a big book, the title of 
which I forget, to prove Marx wrong,0  but it is simply a scurrilous and 
ridiculous pamphlet by which the author wants to call attention—the 
attention of the ministry and bourgeoisie—on himself and his impor­
tance. I have asked all my friends not to notice it. Indeed if any miser­
able impotent fellow wants to faire de la réclame^ for himself,  he attacks 
our author. e 
Friends in Paris have doubted the accuracy of your very sad news 
about Mr Mutual/ Could you give me in some way or other any partic­
ulars of this event?'216 
I enclose a little thing published some years ago.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 217 
IN ROCHESTER 
London, 7 January 1888 
Dear Sorge 
First, let me wish you a Happy New Year and express the hope that 
you will soon settle down in your new locality 218 and that you have 
completely recovered from your accidents last summer. 
We can only hope that the gathering war clouds will disperse— 
everything is already going as nicely as we could wish and we can very 
well dispense with the interruption through a general war and one, 
moreover, on a vaster scale than ever before, although this too must 
eventually redound in our favour. Bismarck's policy is driving the 
working and petty-bourgeois masses over to us in their thousands; the 
pitiable inadequacy of the social reforms, so pompously proclaimed, 
and which are a mere pretext for coercive measures against the workers 
(Puttkamer's anti-strike edict, the proposed re-introduction of employ­
ment books, the purloining of trades union and provident funds) is 
proving enormously effective.219 The new Anti-Socialist Law will do 
little harm; this time, the expatriation clause is unlikely to go through 
and, if it does, it's questionable how long it will last.220 For if—as would 
be best for us—old William* were shortly to kick the bucket and the 
Crown Princeb came to the helm, if only for six months, everything 
would probably be thrown into confusion. Bismarck has laboured so 
hard at getting rid of the Crown Prince altogether and bringing about 
the regency of that insolent guards' subaltern, the younger William,0 
that he would, in such an event, probably be got rid of and replaced by 
a short-lived, head-in-clouds liberal regime. That would be enough to 
destroy your philistine's confidence in the stability of the Bismarckian 
system; and if, along with the young whippersnapper, Bismarck were 
subsequently to return to power, your philistine's faith would nonethe­
less be gone, the lad being after all no substitute for the old man. For the 
bogus Bonapartes of today are as naught unless people believe in them

and in their invincibility. And if the boy and his mentor Bismarck were 
then to grow cocky and produce measures even more insolent than the 
present ones, things would be all set for a crisis. 
On the other hand, a war would set us back by many years. 
Chauvinism would swamp all else since there would be a struggle for 
survival. Germany would place some 5 million men under arms, or 10 
per cent of the population, the others, say, 4 or 5 per cent, Russia rela­
tively less. But there would be some 10 to 15 million combatants in the 
field. And how they are to be fed beats me; it would mean devastation 
like that of the Thirty Years War.221 And it wouldn't be over quickly, 
despite the colossal military forces engaged. For France is protected by 
very extensive fortifications along its frontiers in the northwest and 
southeast, and the new works at Paris are models of their kind. So it will 
take a long time, and Russia is not to be reduced by storm either. Even 
if everything goes in accordance with Bismarck's wishes, therefore, 
unprecedented demands will be made on the nation and it is quite possi­
ble that the postponement of a decisive victory and partial reverses 
would evoke revolution inside the country. But if the Germans were 
beaten from the start, or forced permanently onto the defensive, then the 
fun would surely begin. If the war were fought to a finish without inter­
nal disorder, the state of prostration would be unlike anything Europe 
has experienced in the past 200 years. Then American industry would 
triumph all along the line and we should all be faced with the alternative 
either of a complete reversion to agriculture for domestic consumption 
(any other kind being precluded by American grain) or—social trans­
formation. Hence I suspect that they do not intend to go to extremes, to 
have recourse to anything more than a mock war. But once the first shot 
has been fired, control will have been lost and the horse can take the bit 
between its teeth. 
So everything is tending inexorably towards a decision, war or peace, 
and I must hasten to complete the third volume.a  But events demand that 
I remain au courant and this, particularly as regards the military side, 
requires a great deal of time, and yet I must still take care of my eyes. If 
only I could simply withdraw into my study! However, it's got to be 
done and I shall set to work next month at the latest. 
Shorlemmer, who is here, sends his kindest regards.

the day in the office of the Municipal Council. If the fun begins soon, 
Vaillant will be the guiding light of the next provisional government. 
He's lucky—as a Blanquist he has no need to vindicate an economic 
theory and this enables him to keep out of many a squabble. The 
Possibilists 19 have discredited themselves completely and utterly; having 
advocated total abstention from action, they unsuccessfully sought, in 
company with the reactionaries, to bring a vote of censure in the 
Municipal Council on its office, which had behaved as well as might be 
expected of Radicals of that ilk. 
You have, I trust, been getting Commonweal, Gleichheit and To-day

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 10 January 1888 
Dear Liebknecht, 
As regards expatriation, things are unlikely to move very rapidly. 
However contemptible the German bourgeoisie may be, such 
cowardice calls for a modicum of courage and in my view it will take 
Bismarck a year to knock that courage into them. But quite a lot can 
happen in a year. By intriguing against the Crown Prince,a Monsieur 
a Frederick William (later Frederick III) 

=====第152页=====
Letters- 1888 141 
Bismarck has tripped up badly and if, after the old man3 has pegged 
out, the Crown Prince's turn lasts only six months, it will be enough to 
throw everything into confusion and thoroughly undermine the philis-
tine's confidence in the permanence of the Bismarckian system. After 
that the insolent lad Williamb is welcome to take his turn; he'll do far 
more good than he can do harm. So I trust that your visit to America 
next year will only be a temporary one222 and that we shall see you 
here both on the way out and on the way home. You will find plenty 
of work to do in America for, as you say, the chaps over there have 
bungled things badly.223 The Americans themselves are still too new to 
the movement as a whole and too unfamiliar with it not to perpetrate 
a series of stupendous blunders. But we can also come to their assis­
tance and in such a case a man like you, who is familiar with the 
English movement and capable of handling an English audience, would 
be exceedingly useful. 
There's nothing new to report here. The old Communist Society106  is 
going steadily downhill, being now in the hands of the rascally Gilles; it 
is becoming increasingly chummy with the anarchists whose headquar­
ters are now in London. The Trafalgar Square affair 224 is being celebrated 
afresh with the wholesale sentencing—both in the magistrates' and in the 
criminal courts—of those who took part in the demonstration. Graham 
and Burns are to appear shortly. If they too are sentenced, the London 
juryman will, by his action, have passed a vote of thanks to Warren and 
the police, which can only further the split between the classes. The 
workingmen have an enormous hatred of the police and at the next elec­
tion the stupid Tories will have cause to be aware of it. 
I wish you belatedly a Happy New Year and let's hope there will be 
peace both internally and externally. I have no wish either for war or for 
attempted coups. Everything is going much too famously for that.

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER 225 
IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH 
London, 10 January 1888 
Dear Mr Schlüter, 
I have no objection to Ede's printing the final part of the introduction 
to the Blood-and-Thunder Patriots.226 
Kindly tell me when, approximately, you will be able to start printing 
the Theory of Force. For I am working on a fourth chapter to it in which 
I examine Bismarck's use of force and the reasons for its momentary 
success. I am writing it now, but shall have to revise it immediately 
before printing and make additions in accordance with the latest facts. 
Naturally I shall be happy to place this chapter too at Ede's disposal, 
once everything has got to that stage.203 
I shall shortly be putting my books in order and it may be that 
another copy of the Holy Family will turn up; if so, the archives227  shall 
have it. Meanwhile please continue to keep an eye open for the Revue 
der Neue Rheinischen Zeitung —isolated articles would be of use only in 
cases of direct necessity. 228 
Bruhn's distorted account is mentioned in Herr Vogt, p. 124. Note— 
Bangya, having represented himself as the agent of a chap called 
Eisenmann, or some such name, who was supposedly setting up as a 
bookseller in Berlin, had promised that the latter would print the ms. 229 
This was by Marx and myself and the original is here in my house. 
However, the actual purchaser of the copy was Stieber, who was silly 
enough to imagine that the Prussian police would find in a ms. intended 
by us for publication secret revelations and not merely a derisive 
portrayal of the great men of the emigration, for there was, of course, 
nothing more to it than that. We were done out of  its publication, but the 
people who were really done were the Prussian police, who no doubt 
also took care never to boast about it and, along with them, Mr Kossuth 
who,  until this episode, had been unaware of the unsavoury nature of his 
protégé, though subsequently he still sought to support him. 
Your kind wishes for the New Year are heartily reciprocated. 
Ever yours, 
F. E.

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI 
IN BENEVENTO 
London, 10 January 1888 
Dear Friend, 
I would have written to you long ago, but could only suppose that you 
were no longer in Benevento, for one of the periodicals you very kindly 
sent me bore a different address with a domicile I didn't know. So I have 
been awaiting further word from you. 
The ludicrous charge brought against you in connection with the 
embezzlement of LI5,000 is best refuted by the fact that you have been 
given employment by the government prefect  himself.  I trust that the 
whole intrigue will fizzle out before things get to the stage of public 
proceedings. 
I don't know how the Hamburg business passed off; I have heard no 
further news on the subject from Wedde.230 But it is just as well that 
nothing has come of it. The Prussian government has at last managed to 
bring the government of the Hamburg 'republic' to heel. Our newspa­
per therea has been banned; Wedde, the editor, though a citizen of 
Hamburg, has been banished from his native city, and some twenty 
socialists have been sentenced in Altona (the neighbouring Prussian 
town) and will, on release, be expelled from Hamburg. Under the 
circumstances you too would have been expelled from there and, as a 
foreigner, from the German Empire as a whole; and the cost of the 
double removal complete with family would have been ruinous.

20th of this month and, as you can well imagine, the thing has got to be 
carefully considered and reconsidered. Now, that is something that 
would have done nicely for the Socialiste had you not killed it off just by 
this time. 
The disappearance of the Socialiste spells your own disappearance 
qua party from the Paris scene. 234 After all, the Possibilists manage to 
keep the Prolétariat going and, if you cannot do as much, it means you 
are contracting instead of expanding; it is not the weekly organ that is to 
blame—the other's a weekly too. Meanwhile I refuse to believe that the 
Paris workingman has embarked irretrievably on a period of decadence. 
The French are unpredictable and capable of springing all manner of 
surprises. So I shall wait and see. 
As for Bismarck he, no less than the Russian Panslavists82  and French 
chauvinists, is playing with fire. The present situation suits him so long 
as a glimmer of life remains in old Lehmann (nickname for William, a as 
you doubtless know). Bismarck has every reason to make himself indis­
pensable against the day the old man dies. He and young Williamb have 
hatched something of a plot against the Crown Princec in an attempt to 
induce him to have a laryngotomy, i.e. to have his throat slit.d Since the 
Crown Prince and his wifee are perfectly well aware of this, Bismarck 
has made himself all but impossible so far as they are concerned. And 
that's one of the reasons why the new Anti-Socialist Law has failed to get 
through the Reichstag.235 A Catholic from Colognef declared in open 
session that, before 30 September (when the existing law expires) the 
ministry might well have changed hands. 
That debate on the Anti-Socialist Law was, for us, a real masterpiece. 
It is the first time our men have scored an out-and-out victory in the 
Reichstag. The law will be extended for two years, probably for the last 
time.  But not all the arguments nor all the facts in the world would have 
sufficed to bring about the rejection of the government's demands had 
there been any immediate prospect of young William's succession; he is 
your true Prussian, insolent and arrogant as the officers in Berlin in 
1806,  who would use the steps of the French embassy to whet their 
swords on only, vanquished, to surrender those swords to Napoleon's 
soldiers two months later.236

The possibility of war led me to embark once again on the study of 
things military. If there isn't a war, so much the better. But if it does 
break out—and this depends on all manner of imponderable events—I 
hope that the Russians will be well and truly trounced and that nothing 
very decisive will happen on the French border—for then there might be 
a chance of reconciliation. With five million Germans under arms, called 
upon to fight for things of no concern to themselves, Bismarck would no 
longer have the upper hand. 
In the meantime I am taking care of my eyesight which is improving

Would you let me know as exactly as possible when printing ought to 
begin? The 3 chapters of the original Theory of  Force  are ready for the 
press but the new section is not quite finished yet in the first draft; I am 
not at all satisfied with the latter and, as usual, it is turning out longer 
than I had intended. Moreover, the theme is such that it must be dealt 
with powerfully or not at all. 
As soon as you give me a definite date I can let you know whether or 
not I shall be able to manage it by then. If not, it might be best if you 
could print something shorter in the meantime, for it will be a question 
or 3 or 4 weeks at most. 
Whether the ms. is suitable for publication in the Sozialdemokrat is 
something that had better be decided on the spot when it arrives. 
In any case, having regard to the present critical political situation, a 
certain amount of delay—to see how things turn out—would seem to 
me almost mandatory.

Vincennes, 20 minutes from Paris by train, and are amusing themselves 
doing rural tasks. The Socialiste has died yet again. 234 The workers of 
Paris don't want to read a weekly. Vaillant is acquitting himself famously 
in the Municipal Council; he was much in evidence during the presiden­
tial crisis 197 when the menacing attitude of the workers prevented the 
election of Ferry. He will be the guiding light of the next provisional 
government provided it's not too long in coming. 
Bebel and Singer have inflicted a formidable defeat on the Prussians 
over the Anti-Socialist Law.235  For the first time the whole of Europe 
has had to pay attention to our people in the Reichstag. You will have

he excelled  himself. 0

long years of universal military service and education, Germany can 
mobilise between 2Vi and 3 million trained men and provide them with 
officers and NCOs. France not more than VA to IV2 million. Russia 
barely 1 million. At worst Germany is a match for them both in terms 
of defence. Italy can raise and sustain 300,000 men. Austria roughly 1 
million. Thus, as far as war on land is concerned, the odds are in favour 
of Germany, Austria and Italy, while the war at sea will be determined 
by Britain's attitude. It would be splendid if Bismarck were to be forced 
to cut away his own stay and support, Russian tsarism! 
War or no war, everything is heading for a crisis. The state of affairs 
in Russia can't go on very much longer. The Hohenzollerns are done for, 
the Crown Prince3 is mortally ill, his son,b a cripple and insolent young 
guardee.0  In France the downfall of the exploiters' bourgeois republic 
looms ever closer; as in 1847, scandals threaten to bring about a révolu­
tion du mépris. 238 And in this country the masses are coming increas­
ingly under the sway of an instinctive socialism which still, I am glad to 
say, resists definite formulation in accordance with the dogma of this or 
that socialist organisation, and hence will accept it all the more readily 
when something crucial happens. All that is needed is for the fun to 
begin somewhere or other, and the bourgeoisie will be dumbfounded by 
the hitherto latent socialism which will then vent itself and become 
manifest.

ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY 239 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 22 February 1888 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
I have duly received your letters [of] 21 December and  8 January and 
return LovelPs letter with thanks. 
I am astonished at Grönlund's proceedings, I was rather glad he did 
not call on me here. From all I hear he is full of vanity and self-conceit, 
to a degree unattainable even to a German, to be reached only by a 
Scandinavian, but also so naif in it as only a Scandinavian can be—in a 
German it would be offensive. Es muss auch solche Käuze geben. 3- In 
America not less than in England all these self-announced grands 
hommes' 0 will find their own level as soon as the masses begin to stir— 
and will then find themselves shifted to that level of their own with a 
velocity that will astonish them. We have had all that in Germany and 
France, and in the International too. 
I have since heard from poor old Sorge, in a way that fully confirms 
all you say. I fully expected from the beginning that he would not be able 
to live in that solitude and wilderness. 218 I hope his return to Hoboken 
may prove a success. 
I sent you a No. of Bradlaugh's National Reformer with an article 
No. 1 on my book.0 Copies were sent to: National Reformer, Weekly 
Dispatch, Reynold's Newspaper, Club Journal, Our Corner (Mrs 
Besant), To-day (H. Bland), Christian Socialist, Pall Mall Gazette. I have 
requested friends to look at these papers and magazines and let me know 
if anything appears, when you shall have it. 
Reeves has also sent for the 1,000 pamphlets,d whether that is merely 
a ruse to keep competition out, remains to be seen. The thing seems to 
sell exceedingly well.

Justice had a copy of the book from you, the Commonweal did not 
require one as I sent one to Morris personally. 
Justice brought out again the old American translation of the 
Communist Manifesto.240 This set Reeves inquiring about an authorised 
translation. I had one by S. Moore, and Sam happened to be here. So we 
revised it and sold it to Reeves; he got the proofs last week and as soon 
as it is out you shall have a copy. Sam Moore is the best translator I know 
but not in a position to do work without getting something for it. 
I do not quite understand your remark about the book being sold 
here 1 shilling dearer. $1.25 is equal as far as I know to 5s. and that is the 
selling price here. 
Mrs Campbell has not yet called on me so far. 
Your remarks about my books being boycotted by the official 
German Socialists of New York241 are quite correct, but I am used to 
that sort of thing, and so the efforts of these gentry amuse me. Better so 
than to have to undergo their patronage. With them the movement is a 
business, and 'business is business'. This kind of thing won't last very 
long, their efforts to boss the American movement as they have done 
with the German-American one, must fail miserably. The masses will set 
all that right when once they move. 
Here things go slowly but well. The various little organisations have 
found their level and are willing to co-operate without bickerings. The 
police brutalities in Trafalgar Square185 have done wonders in helping to 
widen the gap between the working men Radicals and the Middle Class 
Liberals and Radicals, the latter have behaved cowardly in and out of 
Parliament. The Law and Liberty League—a body gaining ground every 
day—is the first organisation in which Socialist delegates, as such, sit 
aside of Radical delegates.242 The stupidity of the present Tory govern­
ment is appalling—if old Disraeli was alive, he would box their ears right 
and left. But this stupidity helps on matters wonderfully. Home Rule175 
for Ireland and for London is now the cry here; the latter a thing which 
the Liberals fear even more than the Tories do. The working-class 
element is getting more and more exasperated, through the stupid Tory 
provocations, is getting daily more conscious of its strength at the ballot-
box, and more penetrated by the Socialist leaven. The American exam­
ple has opened their eyes, and if next autumn there was to be a repeti­
tion, in any large American town, of the New York election campaign of 
1886, 7 the effect here would be instantaneous. The two great Anglo-
Saxon nations are sure to set up competition in Socialism, as well as in 
other matters, and then it will be a race with ever accelerated velocity.

Can you get me the American Customs' Tariff and the list of internal 
taxes upon American industrial and other products? And if possible 
some information as to how the latter are balanced by the former with 
regard to cost of production? That is, for instance, if the inland duty on 
cigars is 20%, an import duty of 20% would balance it as far as foreign 
competition is concerned. That is what I should like to have some infor­
mation about, before I write my preface to the 'Free Trade'.*

Dear Liebknecht, 
The debate on the Anti-Socialist Law235 was the biggest triumph we

longer, since you will, after all, be taking Hasenclever's place shortly.43

We also have a Puttkamer over here—Balfour, Secretary for Ireland. 
Just as Puttkamer is Bismarck's cousin, so Balfour is Salisbury's nephew. 
An arrogantly obstreperous stuck-up squire, exactly like Puttkamer. He 
too gets soundly thrashed and last week succumbed to a lambasting at 
the hands of O'Brien,244  just as Puttkamer does at those of our own 
people. Moreover, he's as useful to the Irish as Puttkamer is to us. 
However, you'll glean absolutely nothing from the deplorable Saturday 
Review, supposing you still take it, about what's going on over here; so 
far as anything of importance is concerned, a conspiration du silence 3, 
prevails. 
Bismarck's speech was addressed to Tsar Alexander in person in order 
that the Gatchina prisoner might at long last learn the truth.245 Whether 
it will help is doubtful. The Russians, such is their irresolution, are 
becoming ever more deeply embroiled and in the end they may not be 
able to draw back with honour. Therein lies the danger. As a rule they 
behave like utter jack-asses when they embark on a war. It's a repeat of 
Croesus by crossing the Halys will ruin a mighty  realm.* 0 They can place 
barely a million men on the border and haven't enough officers for 
more. France disposes of VA million very good troops, but no longer has 
sufficient seasoned men and still fewer officers to provide more. With 2 Vi 
million seasoned troops and an adequate supply of officers and NCOs, 
Bismarck has, however, still pitched Germany's strength too low. Nor is 
it a bad thing that this should be so. Until the revolution gets under way 
in Russia, Bismarck must not be brought down by an external defeat. 
That would only restore his popularity. 
But it is impossible to foretell what will come of the affair if it really 
gets to the stage of a war. They'll certainly try to turn it into a mock war, 
but that is not so easy to do. If it is to be done in the way that suits us 
best, and the odds are strongly in favour of it, then let it be a static war 
with changing fortunes on the French border, an offensive war with the 
capture of the Polish fortresses on the Russian border, and a revolution 
in Petersburg which will all at once throw an entirely different light on 
everything, so far as the gentlemen prosecuting the war are concerned. 
This much is certain—there will be no rapid decisions, no triumphal 
marches either on Berlin or on Paris. France is very strong and very clev­
erly fortified; so far as their disposition is concerned, the works round 
Paris are a masterly affair.

Graham (Communist, Marxist, on the above occasion he called for 
nationalisation of all means of production) and Burns,246 Mother Schack 
was running round selling Freedom, the most extreme and strident of the 
local anarchist papers. She inadvertently offered one to Lessner, among 
others. Her unsatisfied craving for action seems to have driven her quite 
dotty. 
Reuss has instituted proceedings against the Commonweal (Morris) 
for denouncing him as a spy.247 Obviously the Prussian embassy wishes 
to regain over here the ground lost in Berlin. It may, however, be making 
hellish blunder. Mr Reuss has to go into the witness box, and in this 
country perjury is not to be trifled with. There's no Puttkamer over here 
to help!

Apropos, Pfänder's widow is living over here in the most wretched 
circumstances. I do what I can and have just sent her another couple of 
£s. The louts' society 106 put on a concert for her and collected about £5. 
She herself is ill, her daughter paints, and the pair of them do bits of 
needlework, but all is wretchedness. Might the party not set aside a 
trifling sum every quarter? The doctor says she'll barely get through the 
winter. See what you can do. We really ought to set aside pensions for 
our veterans' widows.

ENGELS TO FERDINAND DOMELA NIEUWENHUIS 
IN THE HAGUE 
London, 23 February 1888 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
My dear Nieuwenhuis, 
I informed Kautsky of the contents of your letter immediately it 
arrived and understand that he has since seen to everything you wanted. 
The news from here is pretty good on the whole. The various social­
ist organisations have refrained from forcibly accelerating the natural, 
normal and hence somewhat slow process of development of the 
English working class; hence less fuss, less vainglory, but also less disap­
pointment. Moreover they get on amongst themselves. As to setting the 
masses in motion, that has been taken care of by the incomprehensible 
stupidity of the government and the imperturbable cowardice of the 
Liberal opposition. The Trafalgar Square affair185 did not simply 
breathe new life into the working men; the deplorable way in which the 
Liberal leaders behaved then and subsequently is driving more and 
more radical workers over to the socialists, the more so as the latter 
behaved very well on that particular occasion and were to be seen 
everywhere in the front rank. Cunninghame-Graham is a declared 
Marxist and at the meeting last Monday246 demanded outright that the 
nation confiscate all the means of production. So here too we are repre­
sented in Parliament. 
The best proof of how far the workers over here have advanced is 
provided by the radical working men's clubs22 in the East End. What 
impressed them above all was the example set by the New York election 
campaign in November 1886;7 for what America does makes a greater 
impression over here than anything the whole of the continent of 
Europe may do. The example set by New York made it clear to the chaps 
that in the end the workers would do best if they formed their own 
party. When the Avelings returned, they seized on this mood and since 
then their activities have proved most effective in these clubs84—the only 
political workingmen's organisations of any importance that exist here. 
Both Aveling and his wife give several lectures a week down there and 
exert a great deal of influence; there's no doubt that they are now the

158 Letters -1888 
most popular speakers with the workers. The main thing, of course, is to 
wean the clubs from their dependence on the great Liberal Party, prepare 
the ground for their own labour party and gradually bring the chaps 
over to conscious socialism. For, as I have said, the cowardice of the 
Liberal leaders, as also of the majority of London Liberal and Radical 
Members of Parliament, has been of enormous help to us over here. The 
people who were elected 3 or 4 years ago as workingmen's representa­
tives,  the Cremers, Howells, Potters, etc., are already completely played 
out. Were a second ballot to be introduced here instead of the matter's 
being decided, as it now is, by a relative majority at the first ballot, we 
should be able to organise a labour party within six months; under the 
present electoral system the creation of a new, third party is made very 
difficult. But it will come, no question of that, and in the meantime we 
can content ourselves with the knowledge that we are advancing all 
along the line. 
An English edition of the Communist Manifesto, revised by  myself, 
will be coming out in the next week or two; I shall send you one—there's 
a big demand for it over here, which is also a good sign. 
You too will have been delighted at our brilliant victory in the 
Reichstag in Berlin. Bebel surpassed  himself.235  He came to stay with me 
last autumn173 and I only hope that gaol suits you5 as well as it does 
him.64 He says he always feels very much better afterwards (he suffers 
from nerves and in gaol his nervous excitation dies down). 
Shall you be coming over here again next summer? 
With kindest regards. 
Yours,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 25 February 1888 
My dear Laura, 
I have just half an hour before post-time to give you a sign of life after 
sending off the last proofs of the Manifesto.3' I hope you have better 
weather than we here: nothing but East winds, frost, snow showers, 
varying with a few hours' thaw. Very uncomfortable with the English 
system of fire-places, but then this winter cannot last for ever. 
I have not sent the Pall Mall Gazette of late because there is literally 
nothing in it. It is strictly a London local paper, and consequently deadly 
dull when nothing is stirring in London. 
Bebel and Singer had a glorious victory in the Reichstag, not only at 
the first but also at the third reading of the bill.235 It was exactly like 
O'Brien's victory over Balfour244 (who is a Scottish Puttkamer all over). 
Most of our people were at the meeting last Monday to welcome 
Cunninghame-Graham and Burns246; O'Brien spoke there again, and 
very well. Cunninghame-Graham who already before, at Glasgow, had 
publicly stated that he stood on the basis of Karl Marx 'absolutely and 
entirely', here again proclaimed the nationalisation of all means of 
production. So we are represented in the British Parliament too. 
Hyndman, who had not been asked to speak, had got some of his fellows 
to call for him, took possession of the platform, but only to attack 
violently and personally some Radical M.P.s present—invited guests— 
who by the way had been told before by others, quite sufficiently, about 
their shortcomings.b This attack of Hyndman's however was so uncalled 
for and out of place that he was hooted down. 
You will have heard that Reuss has sued Morris for libel for calling 
him a spy in the Commonweal.1*7 Evidently the work of the 
Bismarckian embassy. Morris was very funky at first, not having any 
evidence ready at hand, but I think we have since secured enough to

make it a defeat for Puttkamer and Co. if they should persevere, which 
I doubt. I don't think Reuss will venture going into the witness box, 
perjury is only allowed to regular British police constables. 
Nim wishes me to ask you again to give Longuet a hint that he better 
begin repaying a little of that money. She seems very sore on that point. 
Shall we have war? If so, it will be the most foolish thing on the part 
of the Czara  and the French chauvins^ that they can be guilty of. I have 
lately studied the military chances. What Bismarck says, that Germany 
can send out  2Vi-}>  million of drilled and well-officered men, is rather 
below than above the truth. Russia will never have as many as a million 
actually on the seat of war, and France can send out VA-IV2 million of 
drilled and well-officered men; beyond that, officers and sergeants will be 
either absent or unfit. Thus Germany alone will be quite capable of resist­
ing, for a time at least, an attack on both sides at once. The great advan­
tage of Germany is in the greater number of drilled men, and especially 
of sergeants and officers. As to quality, the French will be fully equal to 
the Germans, as far as the line is concerned; beyond that, the German 
Landwehr 2** is far better than the French territorials. The Russians I 
consider worse than they used to be, they have adopted a system of 
universal liability to service 78 for which they are not civilised enough and 
certainly are very short of good officers. And corruption is there as rife 
as ever—and probably will also play a certain part on the French side, if 
we are to judge from the Wilsoniades168 and other scandals. 
Jollymeier is very melancholy that you have not written him a line yet 
with that gold pen. Have you no mercy with him? He will be here again 
in about 4 weeks for Easter, which this year falls on Bismarck's birthday, 
alias All fools; day.c Very proper too, after people have been foolish 
enough for 1,800 years to celebrate such a fantastical festival! 
Methinks I hear a certain bell calling me to the consumption of—I 
dare say veal cutlets. Farewell for today, and may the breeches of Paul, 
with their excessive length, lose also their perfume of sour size—a 
perfume too well known, alas, to an old Manchesterian!

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 125 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 29 February 1888 
Dear Liebknecht, 
If you people will allocate 100 marks a quarter to Mrs Pfänder, I shall 
do the same, in which case she will have £40 a year and that will safe­
guard her against extreme indigence. 
After Pfänder's death she had a little money, opened a lodging house, 
but was necessarily restricted to a very second-rate neighbourhood; she 
was also unfortunate in other respects (e.g. let rooms to several paed­
erasts who were found out)—in short, it didn't work. Next she took a 
little shop, whereupon the daughter died who alone understood how to 
manage a small business of that sort—in short, the money melted away. 
Pfänder's brother, whom the former had at one time bought out of the 
army and supported for a long period, and who is in New Ulm, 
Minnesota, insisted upon her going over there with her other daughter. 
On arrival they found they were to be treated as 'poor relations' and do 
domestic service. Mrs Pfänder was not slow to decide; she returned 
forthwith, having been there barely a fortnight. That ate up what little 
resources she had left. Since then everything possible has been done for 
her over here, but I am the only person here who can provide for her in 
the long run, though not with a sufficiency in view of all the other calls 
upon me. But, as I say, if your proposal goes through, the worst will be 
taken care of. In any case, it won't be for very long. 
I read the Daily News in the morning, the Evening Standard and Pall 
Mall Gazette in the evenings and the Weekly Dispatch on Sundays. At the 
moment, that is; I sometimes ring the changes. But if there is anything 
interesting in them, I send it to Paris for Laura and cannot very well depart 
from this. However, I shall see what I can send you. Provided you are look­
ing for literary contributions rather than politics, the Weekly Dispatch is at 
all events better than the Saturday Review. Belongs to Mrs Ashton Dilke, 
editor Dr Al. Hunter, M. P. for Aberdeen. It's bigoted, middle class-radical, 
but comprehensive so far as English news is concerned, has much parlia­
mentary gossip during session time, and first-rate correspondence from 
Paris (Mrs Crawford of the Daily News, who can speak her mind much 
more freely here). I'll send it to you sometimes.

I have never heard of the Irish tricolour you mention. The Irish flags 
in Ireland and over here are simply green, with a gold harp, but no crown 
(in the British Empire's coat-of-arms there's a crown above the harp). At 
the time of the Fenians, 1865-67,249 many people wore green and orange 
to show the Orangemen of the North250 that they didn't want to smash 
them but to accept them as brothers. But there's no question of that now. 
I don't think Bismarck is so stupid as to believe that the Russians would 
be a party to his crushing France. Constant squabbling between France and 
Germany is, after all, their chief means of dominating Europe and this 
implies their holding the scales. That Bismarck desires nothing more 
ardently than to sink France, if possible, beneath the waves is, of course, 
undeniable. But it won't be so easy to do. The new French fortifications— 
the Mass and Moselle Lines, the two groups of fortresses in the north and 
southeast (Belfort, Besançon, Lyons, Dijon, Langres, Epinal) and, finally, 
the wonderful new groups of forts round Paris—have taken the wind out 
of his sails; as things are now, Germany cannot get the better of France or 
France the better of Germany. And that's a very good thing. If the worst 
comes to the worst, the frontier will probably be the scene of a static war 
with changing fortunes, which will instill respect for their opponents into 
both armies and make possible a reasonable peace. On the other hand, the 
Russians may suffer a formidable drubbing, and that would be best of all. 
It's just begun to snow again—for the past 3 weeks nothing but snow, 
frost and east wind, with a bit of a thaw in between-whiles. You would 
also seem to be having really filthy weather where you are. 
Many regards.

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER 49 
IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH 
London, 17 March 1888 
Dear Mr Schlüter, 
Once again it's no go with the pamphlet203 so far as the date you give 
is concerned. I am very sorry to have played fast and loose with you like 
this, but it's not my fault. I have to do exactly what my eye specialist tells 
me if I want to get back into proper shape again; I am not allowed to 
write for more than 2 hours, i.e. am forced to break off when I'm just 
getting into my stride, and frequently cannot even make a start because 
of the pressure of correspondence. So it would be better if I were to take 
my time over the thing and do it properly. Also, there's a mass of essen­
tial material which has only just turned up and requires perusal. In short, 
it would be best if you were to look to your own convenience and, when 
I have made enough progress, I shall write and tell you. 
Lehmann the Younger 3 writes a hideously affected German. He has 
every reason to warn people against the dangers of an inadequate educa­
tion, of which he  himself,  in his muddled, liberal-conservative 
Manchesterist proclamation, 251 presents such a terrifying example. 
However, it's hard to have to play the Emperor when you have one foot 
in the grave. Anyhow, if he holds out for another 6 months he will intro­
duce a measure of instability and uncertainty into the economic system, 
and that's all we need. As soon as your philistine has any inkling that the 
system will not go on as it is for ever but is, on the contrary, tottering, it 
will be the beginning of the end. The building has lost its keystone, 
Lehmann I, b and it will soon become evident how rickety the whole 
contraption is. That may mean things will be momentarily better for us 
but also—in certain circumstances—momentarily worse; alternatively it 
may mean war. At all events, we are once more in for a lively time. 
Kindest regards to Ede and Liebknecht if, as I suppose, he is there.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 19 March 1888 
My dear Lafargue, 
I am sending you a Weekly Dispatch which sheds light on the reason 
why 'friend Fritz' is made to work so hard.252 Bismarck would give two 
years of his life to reduce him—Fritz—to a state in which he would be 
obliged to acknowledge himself unfit to rule. That is why his nose is 
kept to the grindstone, and that is why Fritz is having to sweat. The 
intrigue is of long date, its original object being the total elimination of 
Fritz before the old man's3  death; this having failed, they are trying to 
kill him by dint of hard work, state occasions, etc. All this can only lead 
to an open breach, provided Fritz does not succumb too soon; if he 
recovers a little in the course of the summer and then brings about a 
ministerial reshuffle, it will be greatly to our benefit. The main thing is 
that home affairs should become unstable, that the philistine should lose 
his faith in the perpetuity of Bismarck's régime and that he should find 
himself face to face with a situation in which he, the philistine, will have 
to decide and act instead of leaving it all to the government. Old William 
was the keystone and, now that it has fallen, the whole building is threat­
ened with collapse. What we need is at least six months of Fritz to 
undermine it still further, to make philistines and functionaries uncertain 
of the future, and to conjure up the possibility of a change in home 
affairs. Fritz is spineless and, even when in good health, he agrees with 
a William I

his last interlocutor, almost always his wife.a The only things that will 
force his hand are the intrigues of Bismarck and of his own son.b Once 
he has brought about a change of front it matters little how long he lasts 
or does not last; whatever the case, William II will accede in circum­
stances that are favourable to ourselves. 
On the other hand, if Fritz dies sooner, William II will not be the 
same as William I and we shall nonetheless experience a sudden volte-
face on the part of the bourgeoisie. This young man is bound to perpe­
trate follies which will not be forgiven him as were the old man's. If the 
doctors slit his father's throat0 he, the son, may well suffer a similar fate, 
but at the hands of others. He is not paralysed, by the way. His arm was 
fractured at birth, no one noticed this at the time, hence the atrophy of 
that limb. 
In any case the ice has been broken. Continuity in home affairs has 
been disrupted, and movement will take the place of stagnation. That is 
all we require. 
Boulanger is undoubtedly something of a charlatan, but he's not a 
cipher for all that. He has given proof of military gumption and his char­
latanism may serve him well in the French army; Napoleon had his fair 
share of it, too. But he seems politically inept, perhaps because of his 
overweening ambition. There can be no doubt that, if the French want 
to throw away any chance they have of recovering the lost provinces, 
they need only ape Boulanger's friends—in particular Rochefort, who 
seems stupid to the point of folly. All that is needed to reconcile the 
numbskull Alsatians with Germany is an abortive war of revenge; the 
peasants are mercenaries who, given the choice, will always serve in the 
victor's army, while the bourgeois will find their profits assured by the 
German tariff no less than by that of the French. As for the Russians, 
they are sure to be defeated; I have just been studying their 1877-78 
campaign in Turkey 253—98 incompetent generals to 2 tolerable ones, an 
exceedingly ill-organised army with officers beneath all criticism, with 
brave soldiers inured to the utmost hardship (they waded through fords, 
in minus 10 degrees Reaumur, with water up to their chests), very obedi­
ent, but also totally incapable of understanding the only kind of fighting 
possible today—fighting in extended order. Their strength lay in fight­
ing in close order, a form which no longer exists, and anyone seeking to 
revive it would be swept by the fire of modern weapons.

ENGELS TO MARGARET HARKNESS 256 
IN LONDON 
[Draft] 
London, early April 1888 
Dear Miss Harkness, 
I thank you very much for sending me through Messrs Vizetelly your 
City Girl. I have read it with the greatest pleasure and avidity. It is 
indeed, as my friend Eichhoff your translator calls it, ein kleines

Kunstwerk*; to which he adds, what will be satisfactory to you, that 
consequently his translation must be all but literal, as any omission or 
attempted manipulation could only destroy part of the original's value. 
What strikes me most in your tale besides its realistic truth is that it 
exhibits the courage of the true artist. Not only in the way you treat the 
Salvation Army,205 in the teeth of supercilious respectability, which 
respectability will perhaps learn from your tale, for the first time, why 
the Salvation Army has such a hold on the popular masses. But chiefly 
in the plain unvarnished manner in which you make the old, old story, 
the proletarian girl seduced by a middle-class man, the pivot of the 
whole book. Mediocrity would have felt bound to hide the, to it, 
commonplace character of the plot under heaps of artificial complica­
tions and adornments, and yet would not have got rid of the fate of being 
found out. You felt you could afford to tell an old story, because you 
could make it a new one by simply telling it truly. 
Your Mr Arthur Grant is a masterpiece. 
If I have anything to criticise, it would be that perhaps, after all, the 
tale is not quite realistic enough. Realism, to my mind, implies, beside 
truth of detail, the truthful reproduction of typical characters under 
typical circumstances. Now your characters are typical enough, as far as 
they go; but the circumstances which surround them and make them act, 
are not perhaps equally so. In the City Girl the working class figures as 
a passive mass, unable to help itself and not even making any attempt at 
striving to help  itself.  All attempts to drag it out of its torpid misery 
come from without, from above. Now if this was a correct description 
about 1800 or 1810, in the days of Saint-Simon and Robert Owen, it 
cannot appear so in 1887 to a man who for nearly fifty years has had the 
honour of sharing in most of the fights of the militant proletariat. The 
rebellious reaction of the working class against the oppressive medium 
which surrounds them, their attempts—convulsive, half-conscious or 
conscious—at recovering their status as human beings, belong to history 
and must therefore lay claim to a place in the domain of realism. 
I am far from finding fault with your not having written a point-blank 
socialist novel, a 'Tendenz-roman' as we Germans call it, to glorify the 
social and political views of the author. That is not at all what I mean. 
The more the opinions of the author remain hidden, the better for the 
work of art. The realism I allude to may crop out even in spite of the 
author's opinions. Let me refer to an example. Balzac whom I consider a 
a a little masterpiece

far greater master of realism than all the Zolas  passées,  présents et à venir, 1 
in La Comédie humaine gives us a most wonderfully realistic history of 
French 'Society', especially of le monde parisien^ describing, chronicle-
fashion, almost year by year from 1816 to 1848 the progressive inroads of 
the rising bourgeosie upon the society of nobles, that reconstituted itself 
after 1815 and set up again, as far as it could, the standard of la vieille 
politesse française? He describes how the last remnants of this, to him, 
model society gradually succumbed before the intrusion of the vulgar 
moneyed upstart, or were corrupted by him; how the grande dame, 
whose conjugal infidelities were but a mode of asserting herself in perfect 
accordance with the way she had been disposed of in marriage, gave way 
to the bourgeois, who horned her husband for cash or cashmere; and 
around this central picture he groups a complete history of French 
Society from which, even in economical details (for instance the re­
arrangement of real and personal property after the Revolution) I have 
learned more than from all the professed historians, economists and 
statisticians of the period together. Well, Balzac was politically a 
Legitimist 257; his great work is a constant elegy on the irretrievable decay 
of good society; his sympathies are all with the class doomed to extinc­
tion. But for all that his satire is never keener, his irony never bitterer, 
than when he sets in motion the very men and women with whom he 
sympathises most deeply—the nobles. And the only men of whom he 
always speaks with undisguised admiration, are his bitterest political 
antagonists, the republican heroes of the Cloître d Saint-Méry,258  the men, 
who at that time (1830-36) were indeed the representatives of the popu­
lar masses. That Balzac thus was compelled to go against his own class 
sympathies and political prejudices, that he saw the necessity of the 
downfall of his favourite nobles, and described them as people deserving 
no better fate; and that he saw the real men of the future where, for the 
time being, they alone were to be found—that I consider one of the great­
est triumphs of Realism, and one of the grandest features in old Balzac. 
I must own, in your defence, that nowhere in the civilised world are 
the working people less actively resistant, more passively submitting to 
fate, more hébétés e than in the East End of London. And how do I know 
whether you have not had very good reasons for contenting  yourself,  for 
once,  with a picture of the passive side of working-class life, reserving 
the active side for another work?

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 10-11 April 1888 
My dear Laura, 
Schorlemmer returned to Manchester yesterday and so I can sit down 
today and write a few lines, that is to say if Edward and Tussy, who are 
returning from their 'Castle' and will be here about 5, do not drop in too 
soon. 
First of all I must congratulate Paul on his splendid discoveries in 
etymology, which are truly astonishing.259  That a great many French 
words which we used to derive from the Latin bos ox, are descended 
from the Greek bous ox, is already something. But that bouillon comes 
from bous and not from bullire to boil, is a great discovery and only pity 
that Paul did not follow it up a little further. Thus 5o«-strapa 260 is 
evidently of the same derivation, and 5«o-naparte (for 2?o«-naparte) 
also,  and Bonapartism being thus connected with ox, Bou-lznger must be 
derived from bous; and then also its English equivalent Baker, which 
throws a completely new light on the adventure of Colonel Baker in the 
railway-carriage: how could he help rushing on Europa-Robinson, being 
descended from bous Jupiter? 261 Moreover there can be no doubt that in 
mou-tarde the m stands for an original b, and that thus its derivation 
from bous is assured—what a flood of light this throws on the fact that 
mustard is eaten to beef only and not to mutton! 
Another great progress is to treat Sanskrit on the same level as cran-
iology, and to have discovered des linguistes d'Allemagne et 
d'Angleterre 3- who say that le finnois offre plus d'analogie avec les 
idiomes aryens que le sanscrit.^ I have only heard of some who, ascribing 
a the German and English linguists - b Finnish shows more analogies to Aryan 
idioms than Sanskrit 

=====第181页=====

to the Aryan nations a European origin instead of an Asiatic one, find 
themselves placed before the awkward predicament of having to accept 
a Finnic origin of the Aryan language without being able, so far, to show 
the least trace of connection between the two. If Paul had tried to derive 
French from Japanese instead of from Greek, he would have done what 
he maintains these poor devils of Germans and English have done. They 
are badly off enough, as it is. They are second-rate and third-rate 
epigones—the Germans that is—some are even Bohemians—who for 
sensational purposes have started—or rather (by a series of mistakes) 
been conducted to—a paradox theory which has landed them in face of 
a dead wall; the Englishmen have taken the thing up as a fashion, as was 
to be expected from beginners who want to show off as masters—they 
have ventilated their rubbish at the last British Association262  Meeting 
quite en-famille—but that which Paul ascribes to them—the discovery 
of the connection between Aryan and Finnish, a connection closer even 
than that of the other Aryan languages with Sanskrit their sister-
tongue—that they are still panting for, and it is to be hoped they do not 
read the Nouvelle Revue or else they would indeed want to know who 
is this Fergus who holds the magic wand which transforms Aryan into 
Finnic and vice versa. But in case they come, Fergus can point to his Irish 
name in justification of his Irish Bulls or bous. 
But joke à part the articles are very good, and what does it matter to 
the Parisians qui s'en fichent* whether Fergus tells them a few bulls 
about etymology. It is far more important that they should learn a little 
about their own language, and that they find here. Only I don't think it 
is necessary to the amusement of the Parisians that an author should 
commit himself by such assertions. But then we all of us have the incli­
nation to brag most of what we know least; at all events I know I am. b 
11th April. Exactly as I expected. The two hungry soulsc dropped in 
just as I finished the preceding page, bringing eggs, butter, pork pie, 
sausages from their truly rural retreat, and two good appetites. Today I 
had my American mail-day and now try to finish this. 
In France things seems to me to go very well. Boulangism is the just 
and deserved punishment for the cowardice of all parties in the face of 
that bourgeois chauvinism which thinks it can make the clock of univer­
sal history stand still until France has reconquered Alsace. Fortunately

Boulanger proves himself more and more a political ass, more dangerous, 
in my opinion, to himself than to anybody else. Un homme qui a  son plan 
comme Trochu kann sich begraben lasssen? 
For the rest, the Opportunists199  are getting more and more worn out, 
verschlissen^ and have to fall back upon the alliance with the 
Monarchists, that is to say upon political suicide. The great progress in 
French public opinion is this: that the Republic is recognised as the only 
possible government, that Monarchy is equivalent to civil war and 
foreign war. The action of the Opportunists (besides their flagrant 
corruption) drives public opinion more and more towards the Left, and 
compels the nomination of more and more radical governments. All this 
in strict harmony with the regular development since 1875. We can wish 
for no more than that this should continue, and if Boulanger assists this 
move unintentionally all the better. The sense which the French have 
unbeknown to themselves—the necessary logical inheritance of a great, 
unconsciously logical history—will I hope prove more powerful than all 
the nonsense they set to work consciously and intentionally. 
The German philistine convinces himself more and more that with 
old Williamc  the clef de voûte à of the present system has gone, and that 
the whole voûte 11 will gradually follow. I only hope Bismarck will not be 
sent to the right-about merely in order to re-enter in triumph. 
Otherwise he had better stop. 
What a fool that Rochefort is. Quotes Catholic Munich papers to 
prove that the Germans are only awaiting the French again invading 
Germany in order to join them, upset Bismarck and restore French 
domination in Germany! Cannot that idiot see that nothing would more 
fortify Bismarck than such a French attempt to 'free' Germany, and that 
we intend to settle our internal concerns ourselves!

ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLY- WISCHNEWETZKY 239 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 11 April 1888 
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
Your call for the ms.a  comes upon me very suddenly and I am afraid 
I shall not be able to oblige you. I am allowed to write two hours a day, 
no more; have a large correspondence to attend to; find that at the end 
of the two hours, am only just getting warm in harness, and then, just 
then, must stop. Under these circumstances I am quite unable to do arti­
cles de saison to order, especially for a distant market, and do not see my 
way to having the pamphlet ready in ms. by 15th May, much less have it 
ready printed in New York by that time. Still I will set about it at once, 
after clearing off urgent letters, and do my best. I interrupt an important 
piece of business 13 on purpose, to clear this matter off. 
Still in my opinion you need not fear of losing your opportunity. The 
Free Trade question will not disappear from the American horizon until 
settled. I am sure that Protection has done its duty for the United States 
and is now an obstacle, and whatever may be the fate of the Mills bill,263 
the struggle will not end until either Free Trade enables the United States 
manufacturers to take the leading part in the world market to which they 
are entitled in many branches of trade, or until both Protectionists and 
Free Traders are shoved aside by those behind them. Economic facts are 
stronger than politics, especially if the politics are so much mixed up 
with corruption as in America. I should not wonder if during the next 
few years one set of American manufacturers after the other passed over 
to the Free Traders—if they understand their interests they must. 
Thanks for the official publications0—I think they will be just what I 
want.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN 
London, 12 April 1888 
Dear Bebel, 
Since you wrote on 8 March, I have been taking a bit of a look at 
events; things now seem to be settling down sufficiently for one to size 
them up. Your policy of saying that nothing has changed is, when 
applied to the masses, tactically quite correct; but in my view it by no 
means does justice to the historical situation. 

=====第185页=====
174 Letters-1888 
Fritz's proclamations251 show him to be of exceedingly mediocre 
intellect. Anyone who, after so many years as Crown Prince, can find 
nothing better to put forward than the elimination of this or that petty 
tax and, on the military side, the abolition of the third rank, which is 
quite pointless because long since abolished in a fighting formation, is 
unlikely to change the face of the world. The plaint about the evils of an 
inadequate education is apt to be the monopoly of the inadequately 
educated—as in this instance. So much for his intellect. 
In assessing his character one must—because of the state of his 
health—proceed with the utmost caution. If a man is in constant danger 
of having his throat slit by his doctors," he may be excused from bestir­
ring himself unduly; this would only be appropriate were his health to 
improve. Hence it is understandable that in internal affairs Bismarck and 
Puttkamer should have a freer hand than ever before. 
But that is not to imply that nothing has changed. In William1,  the 
building has lost its keystone and the fact that it is tottering is plainly 
manifest. Their internal policy betrays how desperately Bismarck and 
Co. are clinging to their positions. Nor is yours unchanged; it has dete­
riorated precisely because Bismarck wishes to demonstrate that nothing 
has changed. The ostentatious exclusion of the Social Democrats from 
the amnesty, the mass scale of house searches and persecution, the 
desperate efforts to kill off the Sozialdemokrat in Switzerland 81—all this 
proves that Bismarck & Co. feel the ground quaking under their feet, as 
do the efforts of the supporters of the Kartell265 to make Fritz realise 
what a monarch is. 
In true monarchical fashion they give way over all political questions, 
yet it's a court intrigue which brings the conflict to light. The thing's 
absolutely farcical—according to Bismarck, the Tsarc has the right to 
forbid Battenberg's marriage, while according to Fritz and Victoria, in 
their particular case, all the profound and inscrutable political axioms 
whereby they have been guided throughout their lives are suddenly to 
be abolished!266 
Being in such a parlous state, Fritz will doubtless be forced to give 
way here again—unless he gets better and can really weather a minis­
terial crisis. It is not at all in our interests that Bismarck should sulkily 
withdraw, only to return in triumph 4 weeks later, the idol of your 
coalitionist philistine. We should be more than satisfied if the said

=====第186页=====
Letters -1888 175 
coalitionist philistine were to lose all faith in the stability of Bismarck's 
regime. Nor will that stability be restored in Fritz's lifetime. 
Since absolutely nothing more is being divulged about the nature of 
the disease—not even Waldeyer's report which, if favourable, would 
certainly have been made public—there can be no doubt that it's a case 
of cancer. And here again our men of Progress45 are showing what stuff 
they are made of. Virchow who, if only in his capacity as a medical man, 
and one who has already been consulted, ought now to be on the spot, 
is digging for antiquities in Egypt! No doubt he wishes to be called in 
officially! 
There can be no empire without an empereur, no Bonapartism with­
out a Bonaparte. The system is tailored to the man, stands or falls with 
him. Like the old Slav idol of Pomerania, Triglav, our Bonaparte had 
three heads; the middle one has been cut off and, of the other two, 
Moltke is already past his prime and Bismarck tottering. He won't get 
the better of Victoria, she having learnt from her mother 3 how to deal 
with ministers, even all-powerful ones. The old security is gone. The 
insecurity of the foundations will also become apparent in their policy; 
blunders abroad, at home recurrent coups de main. And it will become 
apparent in your philistine's loss of faith in his own idol, in the dwin­
dling energy and zeal of civil servants, their minds bent on the possibil­
ity of change and consequently of a changed future for themselves. All 
this if, as seems probable, Bismarck stays where he is. But should Fritz 
get better and Bismarck's position become seriously endangered, then, 
so Lenchen maintains, they'll take a pot shot at Fritz. This might in fact 
actually happen, should Puttkamer and his Ihrings and Naporras be 
endangered. 
So whatever happens there'll be an interregnum, with Bismarck 
yearning for the exit of Fritz and the entry of the other William.b In that 
case,  however, things won't be at all the same as they used to be. In that 
case there'll be bedlam. Our Bonapartism has now just about reached its 
Mexican period. When that comes, so will our 1866, followed shortly by 
1870;  i.e. it will come from within, a domestic Sedan.267 Well, let it! 
In France things are taking a perfectly logical course—the right-wing 
Republicans are being forced into an alliance with the Monarchists and 
are foundering as a result, and possible governments have to be formed 
ever further to the left. Boulanger is obviously a political nitwit and will

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 16 April 1888 
Dear Liebknecht, 
I was on the point of answering your letter of the 4th when your 
second one arrived with an enclosure for Karl Kautsky and giving me to 
understand that my answers no less than your questions were already 
things of the past. 
All I want to do now is point out how this is connected with the 
Social Democratic Federation's circular.268 
1. The Social Democratic Federation still poses as the only socialist 
organisation in England and the only one entitled to act and speak on 
behalf of the movement over here as a whole. This was why it was neces­
sary, having regard to the preparations for the congress, to emphasise 
that position, the more so as the Socialist League21 in its present form 
will probably fizzle out before long and the Social Democratic

Federation would like to absorb the disjecta membra.3- Fortunately, 
however, that won't come off, for if it did the same old personal squab­
bles would at once begin all over again. 
2. The Social Democratic Federation is closely in league with the 
Possibilists in Paris and, since these in their turn are in league with 
Broadhurst & Co.,269 the Social Democratic Federation must manoeu­
vre. This second reason is the crucial one. Hyndman & Co. have become 
so deeply embroiled with the Possibilists that they can no longer draw 
back, even if they wanted to. 
My opinion of all this congress business? I'm barely capable of 
expressing one, since I haven't the faintest idea of what has been 
discussed and anyway views change, kaleidoscope-fashion, even in your 
own case. By and large I regard all such congresses as exceedingly risky 
unless one is absolutely sure of success from the outset and, unless some­
thing definite and attainable is to be discussed, as somewhat unnecessary. 
The small fry, in particular the Belgians, have the chief say and, since the 
foreign department in Belgium is run, not by the Flemings, but by the 
old Brussels clique—the Brismée family—the same old dish is served up 
every time. But to want to hold your congress over here, 270 one week 
after the Trades Unions have held theirs, would spell utter ruin. Your 
funds would be used up, your people would run off and you'd be irre­
deemably delivered up into the arms of London's wirepullers—ad 
majorem gloriam Hyndmanni.^ 
That Geneva is the place where the French—never mind what sort— 
ought to hold a congress to celebrate the French Revolution of 1789 and 
à propos of the Paris Exhibition 0 is something you'll certainly never get 
them to believe. 
So even if your congress doesn't materialise, it will, in my view, be no 
great disaster. In any case the agenda is needlessly restricted. A congress 
convoked by our Reichstag group would, after all, be attended exclu­
sively by socialists and anarchists, not by Trade Unionists pure and 
simple. A social-democratic congress could throw the anarchists out, a 
general workingmen's congress cannot, and they are capable of being 
thoroughly obstreperous. 
Fritz had better make haste and perk up—from the point of view of 
his health; otherwise Bismarck will prove too much for him. I hope that

Bismarck goes too far and gets sacked, the dissolution to be followed by 
fresh elections under some sort of interim administration. That would 
provide a nice dose of désillusionnement for the philistines. But obvi­
ously when you may be condemned any day to have your throat slit by 
the doctors/ you're unlikely to have much zest for a serious fight. And 
on his own showing Bismarck is already defending himself tooth and

Dear Friend 
I'm glad to hear that a fresh prospect appears to be opening up for 
you and hope you'll manage to prepare for the exam.272 
I cannot, unfortunately, suggest any books that might assist your 
studies in this direction. For an Italian examination German books 
would cover too much ground on the one hand and too little on the 
other; moreover, I am not familiar with the more recent short

compendiums. Still less do I know of any Italian books that would suit 
your purpose; the most I could recommend would be Carlo Botta, 
Storia dei Popoli d'ltalia which begins with Constantinus Magnus, 
circa AD 300. Perhaps also Pietro Colletta, Storia del Reame diNapoli, 
covering the years 1735-1825, a classic. But probably most helpful of 
all would be the textbooks currently in use in your grammar schools 
(corresponding to the French lycées and collèges and our Gymnasien), 
since most of the candidates for archivist's appointments will have 
attended these establishments and the examiners will therefore have to 
conform to the syllabus laid down in those schools. 
But since it is impossible for you in your present straitened circum­
stances to purchase these books I deem it my duty to offer you my assis­
tance. I have therefore permitted myself the liberty of taking out the 
enclosed money order in your name for the sum of four pounds sterling 
or fr. 10080 centesimi and trust you won't be angry with me for sending 
you this small amount without first obtaining your consent. I only hope 
that it will be enough, and that you will be able to procure what you 
need and pass your exam. 
You will have read about our Zurich friends' expulsion from 
Switzerland.81 
I shall look over and return the translation shortly231—as soon as I 
have finished an important piece for America.a Going through a whole 
lot of numbers at the same time cuts down the work. 
With most cordial regards.

Dear Citizen Deville, 
Thank you for your book on Balzac,a which I will read with pleasure. 
After Cervantes Balzac is, or so I think, the greatest novelist of all time, 
as well as the most faithful recorder of French society between 1815 and 
1848.  I am fond of Balzac in whatever form. 
Your interpretation of Marx's formula is faultless. In manuscript it 
read:  M — c ^C  MP  an<^ ll  was  only f°r his own convenience and delecta­
tion that the printer put the symbol <, which has given rise to endless 
misunderstandings. 
Hence the complete formula on p. 18b 
M—CCT P ... C'-M' or 
-MP 
M—C^ P ... (C + c) - (M + m) 
"-MP 
means: 
M, money, converted into C (commodity), which commodity is made 
up of L (labour power) and of MP (means of production); the said 
commodity C is subjected to a process of production P, this last result­
ing in a new commodity C (of different quality, but this does not 
concern us here where we have to do only with values), of greater value 
than and hence equal to C plus an increment c (C + c); this C is once 
more exchanged for money, that is to say for an amount M' greater than 
M, or equal to M plus an increment m (M + m). 
The symbol — serves to mark the conclusion of an exchange; the ....

indicates that the value in question undergoes a change of form which is 
not an exchange—in this case the process of production. 
Should you wish to have anything else explained, I shall always be at 
your service. This second volume will, I am afraid, prove something of a 
headache for you, while failing to reward you with brilliant new solu­
tions.  It is concerned with transactions between bourgeois and the 
results are very nice theoretically but do not have any practical applica­

It's just as well that Fritza is a bit better. If young Williamb  comes to 
the throne at this particular juncture, he and Bismarck—unless all the 
indications are deceptive—will compound with Russia so as to secure 
her permission for a war with France. It would seem that certain contin­
gent agreements have already been concluded. In this way, and only in 
this way, would Boulanger constitute a danger, to France no less than to 
Germany. The French would be beaten, but because their fortifications

are so strong, the war would be a protracted one and other people would 
join in. Probably Austria and Italy against Germany, since Russia's 
permission for something like this could not be obtained without both 
being sacrificed to the Russians. So that means that Bismarck will help 
the Russians to take Constantinople, and that means a world war on 
terms that will quite certainly ensure our eventual defeat—in alliance 
with Russia against the world! I trust this danger will pass.

Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
By this mail I send you registered the ms.a that is to say the copy Mrs 
Aveling made of it when she found that with your close handwriting and 
absence of margin it was impossible to insert in pencil legibly the 
suggested alterations. There were many, arising from the fact that you 
translated from a German translation and we had the original to work 
upon. Many alterations have therefore no other purpose than to bring 
the English text nearer to the French original. In others, I have for the 
sake of clearness taken more liberties. 
The prefaceb is nearly done in the rough, but as you will require a 
German translation, I shall have to keep it a little longer on that account.

Anyhow I will hurry on as much as the two hours a day will allow 
me to do—my doctor has again last week bound me strictly to that 
limit. 
Will you please tell Sorge that according to present arrangements the 
Sozialdemokrat^ 1 is going to be removed to London. But it will be well 
to keep this quiet for the present, when our friends intend this to be 
talked about and to get into the news-hunting press, they will no doubt 
arrange that themselves. 
I am boycotted here almost as much as you are in New York—the 
various socialist cliques here are dissatisfied at my absolute neutrality 
with regard to them, and being all of them agreed as to that point, try to 
pay me out by not mentioning any of my writings. Neither Our Corner 
(Mrs Beasant) nor To-day nor the Christian Socialist (of this latter 
monthly, however, I am not quite certain) have mentioned the Condition 
of the Working-Class though I sent them copies  myself.  I fully expected 
this but did not like to say so to you until the proof was there. I don't 
blame them, because I have seriously offended them by saying that so far 
there is no real working-class movement here,a and that, as soon as that 
comes, all the great men and women who now make themselves busy as 
officers of an army without soldiers, will soon find their level, and a 
rather lower one than they expect. But if they think their needle pinks 
can pierce my old well-tanned and pachydermatous skin, they are 
mistaken.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 274 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 9 May 1888 
My dear Laura, 
I have just finished, after many interruptions, a lengthy preface to the 
English edition of Mohr's discourse on Free Trade (Brussels 1848)a 
which is to come out in New York, and as this is the last piece of work 
which had to be done within a certain time I make use of my recovered 
liberty in order to write to you at once. And I have a rather important 
object too to write about, viz. that we want you here in London. You 
have planted, as I hear from Schorlemmer, some Waldmeister^ in your 
garden, and as it will be utterly impossible for us to come over and use 
it there, there is nothing left but that you should come over and bring it 
here,  when the other ingredients shall be duly and quickly found. The 
weather is beautiful, on Saturday, 0 Mohr's birthday, Nim and I went to 
Highgate, and today we have been on Hampstead Heath, I am writing 
with both windows open, and by the time you come which I hope will 
be next week we shall have lilacs and laburnums ready to receive you. If 
you only say by return that you are willing to come, je me charge du 
rested Moreover you will by this time have brought your country-house 
and garden to such a state of perfection that you can leave it in charge of 
Paul who must be by now an accomplished gardener. Nim has been 
sighing for Löhr for some time past, and surely you ought to be present 
at Edward's great dramatic triumph on the 5 of June when his dramati­
sation of N. Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is to be brought out at a matinée. 
And I need not add that I want you here as much as anybody else. There 
are moreover so many other reasons for your coming that I must refrain 
from stating them here for fear of missing the post and killing you with 
ennui. So make up your mind at once, and say you will. 
Of Edward's remarkable preliminary successes in the dramatic line 
you will have heard. He has sold about half a dozen or more pieces 
which he had quietly manufactured; some have been played in the

provinces with success, some he has brought here himself with Tussy at 
small entertainments, and they have taken very much with the people 
that are most interested in them, viz. with such actors and impresarios as 
will bring them out. If he has now one marked success in London, he is 
a made man in this line and will soon be out of all difficulties. And I 
don't see why he should not, he seems to have a remarkable knack of 
giving to London what London requires. 
Paul's letter in the Intransigeant* was very good indeed. He managed 
to hit the Radicals 200 without the slightest concession to Boulangism137 
and with the demand for general armament, put a spoke in both their 
wheels. It was done with great tact. 
Have you heard that Fritz Beust is engaged—to an Italian-Swiss girl 
from Castasegna, hard on the border of Lombardy. I don't know who she 
is, we shall soon hear from our Zurich friends,b who are expected here in 
less than a fortnight. Maybe you will see Bernstein in Paris on his journey; 
he may be there any day. How they are going to manage here with regard 
to the paper01 am curious to see.81 For many reasons London is not the 
best place for it, though perhaps the only one now. However we shall see, 
and generally things do settle down at their natural level. 
Paul's 'Victor Hugo' in the Neue Zeit is very good. I wonder what 
they would say in France if they could read it. 
The great Stead is off to Petersburg to interview the Czar'1 and to 
make him tell the truth about peace or war. I sent you his Paris inter­
views,6  profound man left Paris exactly as wise as when he came there. 
The Russians will soft-sawder him to his heart's content, I am afraid he 
will return from Petersburg a greater ass than what he is now. Perhaps in 
tonight's paper we may read that he has fathomed Bismarck. 
The Romanians are queer people. I wrote to Nadejde in Jassy a letterf 
in which I tried to work them up in the anti-Russian line. Now the Jassy 
Marxists are quarrelling with the Bucharest Anarchists on account of the 
peasant revolt275 stirred up by Russia, and so they translate and print my 
letter at once!g This time I am not sorry, but it shows what indiscreet 
fellows they are.

What's the position as regards your coming over here? All we have

we are, in a state of suspense and unable to do anything. 
So would you be good enough to get in touch with the others and let 
us know when you are all arriving—yourself, Motteler and Tauscher, we 
presume—and whether we can do anything for you here in the mean­
time.  Let us also know at which station you will be arriving and by what 
route, so that you can be met. Otherwise there could be a glorious 
muddle, in the course of which quite a lot of money might go down the 
drain.

nice if you were here to take your share. We have 6 bottles of Moselle to 
sacrifice tonight. 
Our Zurich friends3  are getting used to London ways a little, and it is 
time,  for their notions of the possibilities of a settlement here were uncom­
monly kleinstädtisch. b Next week I hope the principal questions as to local­
ity etc. will be settled and then there will be less difficulties and discussions. 
Paul's arguments about Boulanger are rather derogatory to the French 
character. First he says, c'est un mouvement populaire ', but not dangerous 
because Boulanger is an ass. But what to think of a peuple capable d'un 
mouvement populaire in favour of an ass? This he explains thus: En France 
on patauge pendant un temps donné dans un semblant de parlementarisme, 
puis on réclame un sauveur, un gouvernement personnel ... en ce moment 
on réclame un sauveur et Boulanger  se présente. c That is to say: the French 
are such that their real wants require a Bonapartist régime, while their 
idealistic illusions are republican and do not go beyond parliamentarism. 
Why, if the French see no other issue than either personal government, or 
parliamentary government, they may as well give it up. What I want our 
people to do, is to show that there is a real third issue besides this pretended 
dilemma, which is a dilemma but for the vulgar philistines, and not to take 
the muddling philistine and au fond chauvinistic Boulangist movement for 
a really popular one. 277 The chauvinistic claim, that all the history of the 
world is to resolve itself into the recovery of Alsace by France, and that 
until then nothing shall be allowed to happen—this claim has been far 
too much bowed to by our friends in France, by every one in fact, and 
this is the upshot. Because Boulanger incorporates this claim, which has 
been silently admitted by all parties, he is powerful. His opponents— 
the Clémenceaux and Co.—do not, dare not contradict that claim but are 
too cowardly to proclaim it openly, and therefore they are weak. 
And because the movement is at bottom chauvinistic and nothing else, 
therefore it plays into Bismarck's hands who would be only too glad to 
entangle that poor devil Fritz d into a war. And all this at a time when even 
among the German philistines the consciousness is dawning that the sooner 
they get rid of Alsace the better, and when Bismarck's crazy

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 279 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 30 June 1888 
My dear Lafargue, 
Little MacDonnell of the General Council, 3 who is editor of a work­
ing-class paper at Paterson, New Jersey, b has sent me a young man 
named R. Block, son of an old New York Socialist—his father is editor 
of a German bakers' newspaper0  and secretary of their trades union. As 
the young man will be spending some days in Paris, I have given him a 
card addressed to you—his only other introduction in Paris is to 
Delahaye—also telling him that, since you live in the country, you can 
be of little use to him, save perhaps as a source of information. He is not 
involved in politics or socialism, and all he wants is to see Europe 'in the 
most approved fashion'. If, then, he should find his way to Le Perreux, 
I would be obliged if you could give him some good advice of the kind 
one might provide for a traveller desirous of seeing as much as possible

position to show him the sights of Paris. 
Aveling is back in London for a play that is to be performed tonight— 
his fifth, while his sixth will probably be performed next week. There 
can be no doubt that, by devoting himself to drama, 'He has struck oil', 
as the Yankees say.

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN ST GILGEN 
London, before 6 July 1888 
Dear Baron, 
Now that I've smelt you out Stieber-fashion,a and having noted from 
its longitude and latitude that it must be a very lovely district, let me 
reply briefly re Shelley.280 I will gladly do the thing but ought, for the 
sake of the context, to have a copy of Shelley which, however, I have not 
got, nor do I know where to obtain one in a hurry. E. Aveling, when he 
was here yesterday, said he would go and fetch his for me, but has left 
London without keeping his word. If I had the passages, I should be able 
to get hold of a Shelley all right. 
I trust that the taenia mediocanellatah  will by now have been happily 
reduced ad absurdum. Pumps' son has got the measles which so far has 
taken an altogether favourable course; Lili c is therefore staying with us. 
Mrs Schlüter and Mrs Ede d are here and we are still expecting the 
Aunte—when, we don't know. On Sunday they were all of them here. 
The muddle has not yet been [...]* out. E. Aveling has been extraordi­
narily lucky with his [.. .]f—unanimously [. .  .]f Louise? if, as I hope, she 
is there.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 6 July a 1888 
My dear Laura, 
Today I write on business and therefore short and, I hope, sweet. 
Jollymeier1,  came last night and leaves next week, probably Wednesday, 
for Germany. He will not have time to return by way of Paris, but the 
present plan is that Nim is going with him as far as Coblenz, and then to 
St Wendel to see her friends, and she does intend to come back by way of 
Paris provided you and the children 0 are there. Will you therefore be good 
enough to let us know if possible by a letter written on Sunday, but on 
Monday at latest, whether 1) you will be at home and 2) whether the chil­
dren will be in Asnières, about the 26th or 28th July? 
It is almost certain that you would have had a visit from Pumps at the 
same time, as she hoped to go with Jollymeier too, but last Sunday she 
came with the news that her boy has got the measles and that will keep 
her here. 
Tussy and Edward are still at their 'Castle'd  and expect to sail some­
time in August to America where Edward is to superintend the mise en-
scène of three of his pieces, to be played simultaneously in New York, 
Chicago and God knows where besides. I don't think they will be away 
more than 8-10 weeks altogether. If his dramatic success goes on at this 
rate, maybe he will have to go next year to Australia, at the expense of 
some theatrical impresario. 
Our Zurich friendse are not settled yet—but on the way towards it. It 
is most astonishing, the bother, delay and kicking about of heels that is 
caused by the London system of monopolist landlords who prescribe 
their own terms to their leaseholders so that when you want to take a 
business-place from one of these latter—and that you have to do—you 
have to wait the great landlord's pleasure in giving you leave to set up the 
necessary machinery. French or Prussian bureaucratic interference

Dear Sorge, 
In great haste a piece of news which, however, you must keep 
absolutely secret. Don't be surprised to see me suddenly turn up about 
the middle of August or a few days after that—I may be taking a quick 
trip across the ocean. 281 Could you please let me know by return where 
you lie, so that I can look you up or, should you happen not to be at 
home at the time, where you are to be found? Also whether the 
Wischnewetzkys will be in New York at the time. I shall not see anyone 
else when I come over, for I have no wish to fall into the hands of the 
worthy German Socialists—which is why the thing has got to be kept 
secret. If I do come, I shall not come alone but with the Avelings, who 
have business over there. More anon.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 274 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 15 July 1888 
My dear Laura, 
You ask why Schorlemmer cannot come too, and you hope to see 
Pumps over at Le Perreux. Well, I am afraid you will have your wish 
fulfilled and your question answered with a vengeance. 
Pumps' boy having improved extra-rapidly, sudden resolutions were 
come to last Monday, and on Wednesday the lot—Jollymeier, Nim and 
Pumps, all three set off for Germany. Pumps to Paulis', Nim to St 
Wendel. And then, according to what was arranged here, Pumps and 
Schorlemmer are to take up Nim at St Wendel and all three start for 
Paris,  where they will arrive somewhere about the 29th or 30th July— 
but they will let you know. Nim and Schorlemmer must be here again 
on Saturday, 4th August; Pumps talked of going from Paris to St Malo 
and Jersey where Percy intends taking the children. 
How you will manage to quarter the lot of them is more than I know. 
But Nim thought you would get over that difficulty right enough. 
Anyhow you will be wanting some little cash for the occasion which I 
shall not omit sending you in time. 
Last night your letter with Longuet's document came to hand—at the 
same time as Edward who is again brought to London by his dramatic 
industry. He is going to read two plays today to speculative actors (Alma 
Murray is one) who intend to invest in a bit of novelty. Of course 
Longuet is again counting without his host, as Edward and Tussy will be 
going to America for at least two months and I shall take my holiday as 
soon as Nim comes back—if he likes to leave Jean with Nim at my place, 
all right, and Nim would be glad of his company; but is that what 
Longuet contemplates? Anyhow Tussy will return the plaidoyer* to you 
and write, and you and Nim can settle the remainder. 
What a nice mess that was which Boulanger and Floquet cooked 
betwixt the two of them the other day—Boulanger's coup de théâtre, 
a speech for the defence 

=====第208页=====
Letten- 1888 197 
pre-arranged in every detail and yet miscarried because he could not keep 
up his part to the end—Floquet's rage and invective where a cool reply 
would have been required—the insults, the duel, and le beau, le brave 
général worsted by an avocaû 12,2 Decidedly, if the Second Empire was the 
caricature of the First, the Third Republic is getting a caricature not of the 
First, but even the Second. Anyhow, let's hope this is the end of 
Boulanger, for if the popularity of that fool continued, it would drive the 
Czar a into the arms of Bismarck, and we don't want that any more than 
the Russo-French war of revanche. If the popular masses in France 
absolutely require a personal god, they had better look out for a different 
man, this one makes them ridiculous. But moreover it is clear that this 
desire for a sauveur de la société}' if really existing in the masses, is but 
another form of Bonapartism and therefore I really cannot bring myself 
to believe that it is as deeply rooted and vraiment populaire 0 as some 
people say. That our people fight the Radicals, well and good, that is their 
proper business, but let them fight them under their own flag. And as a 
journée^ is only possible—so long as the people are unarmed—with the 
help of the Radicals 200 as on Carnot's election197), our people have only 
the ballot-box to rely on for the present, and I do not see the advantage 
of having the voters' minds muddled by this plebiscitary Boulangism.283 
Our business is not to complicate but to simplify and make clear the 
issues between the Radicals and ourselves. What little good Boulanger 
could do, he has done, and the chief good he did is to bring the Radicals 
to power. A dissolution would be a good thing—while a Radical govern­
ment is in, upon whom we can exercise pressure; but Boulanger seems to 
me the least likely person to bring that dissolution about. 
Here, after two fine days, it rains again cats and dogs since this morn­
ing. This is really a solution—summer dissolved in rain water—which 
makes one dissolute and drives one to drink. In fact I shall go and open 
a bottle of Pilsener and drink your health. Sur ce, je vous embrasse.^ 
Bien a vous}

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 23 July 1888 
My dear Laura, 
Tussy returns me Longuet 's letter, instead of direct to you, so I send 
it herewith. She said she would write to him. Edward told me last week 
they would be here again yesterday, but he has a capacity of neglecting 
facts,  when they are contrary to his wishes, that is worthy of a more 
juvenile age. So they won't be here before end of week. 
Of course Pumps and Nim can sleep in your room and if you can find 
a bed for Schorlemmer somewhere in Le Perreux, he will be all right. I 
enclose a cheque for £15—so as to set you at ease with regard to the ways 
and means. 
Our Zürichers 3 are at last in a fair way of settlement. Their wives 
have arrived, they have got a business-place—that is, the agreement for 
an empty and not quite finished house—and private houses for them­
selves, so that in a week or 14 days they will all be unter Dach und 
Fach. h The female part of the Sozialdemokrat is not over charming. Ede 
Bernstein's wife seems the pleasantest, a sharp little Jewess, but she 
squints awfully; Schlüter's is an exceedingly good-natured and retiring 
little Dresden article, but uncommon soft; and as to the Tante, c id est 
Mrs Motteler, let Nim give you a description of this dignified juvenile 
of fifty (so they say), this Swabian Kleinstädter^ affecting the dame du 
monde e—I am told she is a very worthy woman after all, but I don't 
think she feels at home among our undignified lot, and I anticipate 
some pleasant little sparrings when Tussy and she do meet. But Nim 
and Pumps will give you a description of her to your heart's content. I 
had them all here yesterday for supper, as our new girl (I think I told 
you that I sent Annie away) cooks quite passably and rather prides in 
cooking for company, and Mrs Motteler lost no time in telling me that 
the custard was burnt (just as she told Pumps: Sie sind aber mal fettl f

—imagine Pumps's horror!) When they are once settled in their own 
establishments—all about Junction Road and the Boston—I hope 
distance will lend enchantment to the view—of considerably reduced 
visits from the lot—I don't quite intend to have the German element 
swamping everything at No. 122.a

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 30 July 1888 
My dear Laura, 
Hope by this time you have got the travellersa with you. 
This morning letter from Schorlemmer. When he arrived at Bonn, his 
friends advised him to have his wound cured there and so he went to the 
University Klinik from which he was on Saturday discharged cured, but 
he still suffers from a Magenkatarrh^ or, as his brother 0 who is with him 
and serves him as amanuensis, more properly spells it, Magenkater; A and 
is ordered to keep quiet for some time—he is even afraid that ulterior 
plans we had about a sea-trip 281 of some duration may fall to the bottom 
as far as he is concerned. That however we shall see by and by. Anyhow, 
he intended to go to Darmstadt yesterday and will write again from 
there. 
For Nim's information: yesterday we had roast beef and peas, very 
well cooked; there were only Edward and Tussy, as Percy and the chil­
dren dined at Sandhurst Lodge, it being his mother's birthday. After 
dinner they came over (and Charley,e  whose wife had called for supper 
the Sunday before, and I was only sorry she did not drop in then) and 
later on the four Zürichers^ with Mrs Bernstein and Mrs Schlüter —the 
Tante%  was out of sorts fortunately—and we were very jolly. I am getting 
on right enough with the girl, only her sweets are not what they exactly 
should be; she makes a beautifully leathery paste and makes up for other 
defects in her custard by putting in about as much essence of bitter 
almonds as sugar—that however I have stopped. The girl is right 
enough, only she wants a bit more breaking-in by Nim; longer than 
three weeks' more or less independent management she is not yet fit for, 
as she imports a lot of superior notions from the East End lodging-house 
where she was attending upon 'Ladyships'. But as these are confined to 
a Helene Demuth and Mary Ellen Rosher - b stomach cold - c  Ludwig 
Schorlemmer - d stomach hangover - e presumably Charles Roesgen - f  Eduard

cooking chiefly, Nim will soon break her of them, and on the whole I 
have no reason to complain, though sometimes to laugh. 
I hope you have better weather. I went to town about 2, it began rain­
ing before 3, and is still at it. 
Love to all of you.

Dear Sorge, 
Your two letters* received with thanks. I am most grateful for the 
hospitality you offer me, but whether I shall be able to take advantage of 
it is somewhat problematical, as you will see from what follows. 
For if all goes well, Schorlemmer will be coming too—he is in 
Germany and not particularly well but has telegraphed saying he'll be 
here on Monday. Since we shall have to remain together—Schorlemmer 
and I, at any rate—Aveling has already booked rooms for all of us at an 
hotel, which means that I shall have to go there—to begin with, at least. 
What happens after that remains to be seen. At all events Schorlemmer 
and I shall stay in town for a few days only and set off as soon as possi­
ble on a tour of the country, for at the beginning of October he has got 
to start lecturing again and we are anxious to see as much as we can.

That I shall find little Cuno lying in wait for me is to be expected. But 
I think I've got a magic formula that will make him tractable. If I go back 
there just before I leave for home, I suppose I shall have to see one or 
two of the Volkszeitung people; it would be unavoidable and wouldn't 
do any harm. It's just that I'd rather they left me alone at the start. 
We are sailing on the City of Berlin on the 8th of this month. Aveling 
has made a successful début in the field of drama and is to help stage 4 
plays (of which  3V2 are by him) in 4 cities over there. 
Since Monday is a Bank Holiday,144 when nothing can be done 
because all the shops are closed, and we have got to leave here on 
Tuesday/ there's a lot of shopping to be done—besides which I have got 
to be at Charing Cross at 5.40 to meet Lenchen and Pumps (who has 
been married for 7 years and has 2 children) on their return from 
Germany resp. Paris, and hence must close. I, too, look forward tremen­
dously to seeing you again. So no more till we meet.

My dear Laura,

New World.281 The plan has been of pretty long standing, only it was

constantly being crossed by all sorts of obstacles, last not least 
Schorlemmer's misadventure—but he will be here tonight (fresh acci­
dents excepted) and tomorrow we expect to be off, leaving Liverpool 
landing-stage at five p.m. on Wednesday.3  The affair had to be kept 
secret, firstly because indeed of the series of obstacles which threat­
ened to wreck it, and secondly in order to save me as much as possi­
ble from the interviewers of the New York Volkszeitung and others 
(among whom, Sorge writes, little Cuno is now one of the most 
formidable) and from the delicate attention of the German Socialist 
Executive, etc. of New York, 223 on arrival, as that would spoil all the 
pleasure of the trip and undo all its purpose. I want to see and not to 
preach, and principally to have a complete change of air, etc., in order 
to get finally over the weakness of the eyes, and chronic conjunctivi­
tis which Dr Reeves, Edward's friend, says is due entirely to want of 
tone and will most likely give way to a long sea voyage, etc. When I 
proposed the job to Schorlemmer, he fell in at once, but of course 
must be back by beginning of October, so that his Flushing accident 
came at a very awkward time. But that seems all right now and he is 
due tonight. 
Edward and Tussy will not come back with us, as far as we can see; 
they are sure to be kept there at least a fortnight longer. 
Our travellers arrived here all right, though half an hour behind 
time,  on Saturday and as our post-card will have informed you, your 
currants—both raw and in the juice extracted by Helen—I mean 
Nim —found the fullest and most general appreciation; the enthusiasm 
as to your garden is almost wild in its manifestations and I think both 
Pumps and Nim dream of it. In spite of their partly rough passage 
neither was sick, they were wise enough to lay down at once. 
I enclose a cheque for £25—to go on with during my absence. Shall 
let you hear again on arrival and report on adventures, sea-monsters, 
icebergs and the other wonders of the sea, unless captured by the Irish 
fleet which has succeeded in breaking the blockade of the English on 
Saturday night and is now destroying British commerce, capturing 
Scotch coast towns, etc.b—a capital augury of the real political victory of 
the Irish over the British philistine which the next general election is sure 
to bring.

Liverpool and Queenstown, 
9 August 1888 
Dear Hermann, 
I set sail yesterday on a quick trip to America281  and just wanted to 
tell you as much before we leave the last European port. We are a merry 
party of four—myself,  Prof.  Schorlemmer of Manchester, Dr Aveling of 
London and his wife, Marx's youngest daughter. Schorlemmer and I 
shall be returning towards the end of September and expect to be back 
in England on 2/3 October. My being able to realise this long-standing 
plan this summer was most propitious and I had also been strongly 
advised on medical grounds to make the two longish voyages and get a 
complete change of air. 
Our ship is much more beautiful than the Berlin ashore; she is nearly 
6,000 tons and the Avelings came back from New York on her eighteen 
months ago. They know the captain, purser and crew, which is very nice. 
We have charming cabins, the fare is excellent and on top of that there is 
American lager beer, which is by no means bad, a long deck to rove 
about on and not too many passengers, provided a large number don't 
join us at Queenstown—in short, it all promises to be very pleasant. I am 
most eager to see the world on the other side; we shall be staying for 3 
or 4 weeks, which is just long enough, I think. 
We are nearing Queenstown, so I had better close. Mind you all keep 
well. I shall write to you again from the other side of the ocean. Regards 
to your wife and children3 and all other relatives. 
With much love from

you straight in the eye with none of the hang-dog look of the usual

The Europeans, as I told the superintendent, are not bold enough for 
that. To which he replied in true American fashion: well, we try to make 
it pay, and it does pay. I acquired a great respect for the Americans in 
that place. 
Concord is really beautiful, elegant in a way one wouldn't have 
expected after New York or even Boston, but a splendid little place in 
which to be buried, though not alive! four weeks there would either kill 
me or drive me crazy. 
My nephew Willie Burns is a wonderful fellow, bright, energetic and 
with his heart and soul in the movement. He is doing well, works for the 
Boston and Providence Railroad (now the Old Colony0), gets $12 a 
week, has a nice wife (whom he brought with him from Manchester) and 
three children. Nothing would induce him to return to England; he's just 
the lad for a country like America.

been here since Monday. a Tomorrow we go to Niagara and if possible 
from there to Chicago, otherwise to the Oil Regions, and then, after 
Toronto, Montreal, Lake Champlain, the Adirondacks and Albandy, 
down the Hudson back to New York, whence we sail for Liverpool by

My dear Laura, 
Here we are since last Sundayb  morning, after having spent a week in 
New York and another in Boston. Don't you believe that America is a 
new country—it is the most old-fashioned place in the world; vis-à-vis 
de nous autres Européens c'est tout simplement la province, et nous nous 
sommes tous Parisiens comparés aux Américains.' The American girls on 
the Steamer already struck me as having all the manners of the Unschuld

Letters -1888 211 
London in 1838,290 and upon this primitive state of things they have 
grafted a lot of supra-modern novelties many of which are no improve­
ments and none of which are beautiful. They say they are the most go-
ahead nation and that is true in this sense, that an American cannot bear 
the idea of anyone walking in front of him in the street, he must push 
and brush past him—roughly too, even in Boston which is their 
Athens—and women as well as men shove you about in that way, and 
sure when we poor benighted Europeans cannot see the slightest occa­
sion either for the hurry or the rudeness. 
But for all that they have very very grand features and the making of 
a very great nation in them, such as are only to be found in a people 
which never knew feudalism. They are long-suffering as to grievances of 
their own making, like all Anglo-Saxons, but when they do a thing they 
do it thoroughly. The way in which the State of New York bought up all 
the grounds (on the American side) about the falls," turned out all the 
touts,  hucksters and extortionists, and transformed the whole into a 
public park where you go about freely and unmolested, not a policeman 
or park-keeper to be seen, on good footpaths and safe stairs quite up to 
the edge of the falls—that is a thing you do not find anywhere in such 
places in Europe. And the simple fact of the Americans having done this 
compelled the Canadian government to do the same on their side, in 
order to attract the visitors who ran away from Canadian exploitation. 
New York is the grandest site for the capital of Capitalist Production 
you can see. But everything there, made by man, is horrid—save 
Bartholdy's Statue of Liberty which is not only fine but in exact propor­
tion—as to size—to the surroundings. We got into New York after dark 
and I thought I got into a chapter of Dante's Inferno. London is a fool 
to it as to noise, crowd, pushing—a pavement worse than in the sunken-
est European village—elevated railways thundering over your head, 
tram-cars by the hundred with rattling bells, awful noises on all sides, 
the most horrible of which are the unearthly fog-horns which give the 
signals from all the steamers on the river (the whistle is unknown here)— 
naked electric arc-lights over every ship, not to light you but to attract 
you as an advertisement, and consequently blinding you and confusing 
everything before you—in short a town worthy to be inhabited by the 
most vile-looking crowd in the world, they all look like discharged 
croupiers from Monte Carlo.

Niagara is very fine. The falls are only the crowning feature. I like the 
rapids above and below, the beautiful little islands crowded with trees 
above the falls, and the fine winding gorge below, even better than the 
'grand' feature. 
We go from here into Canada, down the St Lawrence to Montréal, 
thence back to the States, via Lake Champlain and Lake George, then 
per Steamer down the Hudson to New York and sail per City of New 
York any time about 18th, hoping to be back in London about 28 or 29th 
at latest. 
The little Steamer on the photo is the Maid of the Mist and goes quite 
close up to the falls (they lend you waterproof coats and helmets for the 
occasion) and yesterday we went quite into the mouth of the Horseshoe 
falls (the one facing you). 
We are all very well and jolly, Edward conducts and commands, and 
we have appointed him General Boulanger of the port, which post he 
fills most creditably. As to European politics we are quite out of reach of 
everything. So now I close. Kind regards to Paul.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 291 
IN HOBOKEN 
Montreal, 10 September 1888 
Dear Sorge, 
Arrived here yesterday, having had to turn back because of a storm 
between Toronto and Kingston (it really blew pretty hard) and put into 
Port Hope. So the two-day trip from Toronto to here turned into 
three. The St Lawrence and the rapids were very fine. Canada is richer 
in ruined houses than any country save Ireland. We are doing what we 
can to understand Canadian French; that language beats Yankee 
English hollow. Tonight we go to Plattsburg and from there to the 
Adirondacks and if possible the Catskills as well, so we're unlikely to 
be back in New York before Sunday. 3 As we have to embark on 
Tuesday eveningb and there are still various things we must see in New 
York, and as during these last few days we shall all have to keep 
together more than would otherwise be necessary, Schorlemmer and I 
shan't be able to stay with you in Hoboken this time, much though we 
regret it, but must go to the St Nicholas with the Avelings. However 
we shall come and see you as soon as we get there. The transition from 
the States to Canada is a curious one. First of all you imagine yourself 
back in Europe and then you feel you're in a land that is positively 
retrogressing and going to rack and ruin. Here you can see how essen­
tial the Americans' feverish spirit of speculation is to the rapid devel­
opment of a new country (given capitalist production as its basis). In 
ten years this sleepy Canada will be ripe for annexation—by which 
time the farmers in Manitoba, etc., will be demanding it themselves. In 
any case this country has already been half annexed from the social 
point of view—hotels, newspapers, advertisements, etc., all conform to 
the American pattern. And however much they may struggle and 
resist, the economic need for an infusion of Yankee blood will assert 
itself and abolish this ludicrous boundary line—to which, when that 
time comes, John Bull will say Yea and Amen.

well through the winter. To-morrow afternoon we are leaving per the 
City of New York and look forward to a little excitement, breakdowns 
of machinery and such like things, but hope to arrive, in spite of all, in 
8-9 days in London. I cannot leave America without again expressing 
my regret that unfortunate circumstances prevented me from seeing 
you more than once and but for a few moments. There are so many 
things that we should have talked over together, but it cannot be 
helped and I shall have to go on board without taking leave of you 
personally. Anyhow I do hope that the troubles you have gone 
through lately149  will be the last, that your own health and that of Dr 
Wischnewetzky and the children will be all you can wish for. I shall 
be glad to hear soon again from you, and all your wishes shall have my 
best attention. 
I have some copies of the pamphlet3  from Mrs Sorge, it is very cred­
itably got up and so far I have discovered only two misprints. Please 
let me know how many copies you are sending me to England and how 
many I may distribute to the press; I believe it ought to be sent to all 
the chief dailies and weeklies in London and some in the provinces, 
also the monthlies. Of course, unless instructed to the contrary, I shall 
entrust the sale to Reeves. As he has accepted the agency for your 
American publication generally, his name might have been put on the 
title page; he will have to print a new title page and send in a bill for 
that. 
Hoping to see Dr Wischnewetzky in London on his return, I remain,

ENGELS TO HERMAN ENGELS 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
S.S. City of New York 
Thursday, 27-28 September 1888 
Dear Hermann, 
I am writing to you under difficult circumstances as our ship is rolling 
abominably and half the people on board are still sea-sick. We have had 
a very agreeable, interesting and instructive trip. After a good crossing— 
only one really nice storm—we arrived in New York on 17 August, 
stayed there about 8 days, then spent 7 days in Boston, 5 days at the 
Niagara Falls, then, via the Lake of Ontario to the St Lawrence River, 
down which a steamboat took us to Montreal, thence back to the States 
and Plattsburg, whence we diverted to the Adirondacks, which are very 
lovely, then on by steamer via Lake Champlain and Lake George (like 
parts of Lake Como, but smaller and quite untamed) to Albany and, 
finally, down the Hudson and back to New York by steamboat. As ill-
luck would have it, we had booked a passage aboard the new vessel City 
of New York, the largest passenger ship afloat, 10,500 tons and said to be 
capable of 500 sea miles a day. But this is only her fourth voyage, the 
engines tend to fail, one is ailing and is operating at barely half power, 
while the other is put to considerable strain and is constantly having to 
be tinkered with. Luckily we have reached this spot, latitude 51 degrees 
north, longitude roughly 21 degrees west of Greenwich, without any 
particular mishap to the engines, and hope to be at Queenstown a tomor­
row afternoon, and in London on Saturdaya evening. The crossing has 
been pretty rough, two whopping great storms and high seas all the time 
except for the first two days. No one in our small company has been in 
the least affected by sea-sickness, we have eaten, drunk and smoked 
incessantly and I have just this moment—11 o'clock in the morning— 
been summoned to take my morning Tipple. 
The voyage has done me a tremendous amount of good; I feel at least 
5 years younger, all my little infirmities have faded into the background,

even my eyes have improved, and I would advise anyone who is feeling 
decrepit and under the weather to cross the Atlantic and spend a fort­
night or 3 weeks at Niagara and a similar period in the Adirondacks 
2,000 feet above sea level. The air there is quite excellent, while the 
August sunshine of Lombardy is combined with the fresh breeze of our 
Rhenish October. I already feel an urge to go out there again next year, 
if I can get someone to go with me. You ought to consider it; you and 
Rudolf c could, I am sure, do with a tonic of this kind. The tour isn't at 
all fatiguing; everywhere, in the better hotels, the food is first-rate and 
the German beer, i.e. brewed after the German fashion, quite excellent, 
only wine being dear, though a good bottle of Rhine wine is to be had 
anywhere for 1 dollar or 1 dollar and 50 cents, nor is American wine at 
all bad, though unfortunately not as a rule obtainable in the hotels. We 
have got 24 bottles on board, which we are drinking with gusto—Ohio 
wine (Reisling and sparkling wine) and Californian Riesling with a very 
good flavour but no bouquet. 
Much love to Emmab and the children,0 ditto to all our relations.

ENGELS TO CONRAD SCHMIDT 4 
IN BERLIN 
London, 8 October 1888 
Dear Dr Schmidt, 
I should have answered your letter of 2 February long since had I 
known where to write to. I had been daily expecting news of your 
successful Habilitation* in Switzerland and hence of your removal to 
Zurich or Berne. Finally I took it with me to America, which I visited 
last August and September in company with Dr Aveling and his wife and 
Schorlemmer, but once again did not get round to answering it during 
the trip and now, on my return, I find a further message from you dated 
23 August (on which day I was battling with mosquitoes in New York, 
much more dangerous adversaries than all your German professors of 
political economy put together). 
Your account of the adventures attending your Habilitation bring 
back vivid recollections of the wretchedness of the German universities. 
That's what passes as freedom of scholarship. It's the old story of Bruno 
Bauer in the forties, 295 except that we have come on a bit and now have 
not only theological and political heretics but economic ones also. Still, 
I trust that Thucydides296 is in a humane mood and won't place any seri­
ous difficulties in your way in Leipzig. 
I was most interested to learn that a 'confessional' university still 
actually exists in Germany.297 What odd things the 'reborn' fatherland 
continues to harbour! 
I am very anxious to hear about your work. Apart from  yourself, 
Lexis also tried to solve the problem to which I am obliged to revert in 
my preface to Volume III of Capital.™ That you should finally have 
arrived at Marx's viewpoint in the course of your studies doesn't surprise 
me at all; I believe that this would happen in the case of anyone who 
tackled the matter painstakingly and with an open mind. After all, many 
professors nowadays, exploiting Marx as they do, have trouble enough 
in maintaining a more or less seemly distance between themselves and 
a Qualification for lecturing at universities 

=====第232页=====
Letters -1888 221 
conclusions that are necessarily bound up with what they have annexed, 
while others, as the passage you extracted from our Thucydides goes to 
show,299 must needs relapse into utter puerility to provide any sort of 
answer at all! 
If, as I hope, my eyesight lasts out—my American jaunt did me a 
power of good—Volume IIP will be ready for the press this winter and 
in a year's time will hit that company like a bombshell. I have broken off 
or postponed all my other jobs so as finally to be done with it and am 
exceedingly hard pressed. The greater part is almost ready for the print­
ers, but two or three of the seven sections need a great deal of revision, 
especially the first, of which there are two versions. 
I found America most interesting. It is a place one really must have 
seen with one's own eyes, this country whose history goes back no 
further than commodity production and which is the promised land of 
capitalist production. People's usual conceptions of it are as false as those 
a German schoolboy has of France. There was also much natural beauty 
to be enjoyed at Niagara, on the St Lawrence, in the Adirondacks and on 
the smaller lakes. 
I have read Platter's critique of G. Cohn.b The beginning is very good 
and witty, but further on the good Platter runs out of steam. 
Over here all is much as it was, save that the four people expelled 
from Zurich0 have arrived, and Aveling is now writing plays which have 
been very well received by the impresarios. He was sent to America to 
rehearse 3 of his plays over there. 
I still have a whole pile of letters to answer and if I miss this post I 
fear I shall be interrupted, so I had better close straight away. Goodbye 
and let me have further news of you very soon, by which time I trust 
you will have been duly installed as a lecturer. 
Yours very sincerely,

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 29 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 10 October 1888 
Dear Sorge, 
We finally got back here last Saturday week3  and since then I have 
sent off to you 2 To-Days and a pile of Commonweals and today a pile 
of Gleichheits as well as 2 more Commonweals. One Gleichheit is miss­
ing. Ede Bernstein took it and I haven't got it back yet. 
Little has changed over here; the next No. of the Sozialdemokrat will 
be printed in this country. 81 Otherwise nothing at all seems to have 
happened. 
The City of New York is a humbug; in a calm sea she is steady, of 
course, but once she starts rolling, no one can do anything to stop her. 
Moreover, her engines are in a deplorable state; one of them was operat­
ing at barely half power, while the other threatened to break down at any 
moment because of the excessive strain. We never did more than 370 sea 
miles in a day and once it was only 313. 
In so far as the political situation makes a survey possible, the esti­
mate we formed of it over there was quite right. Bismarck has gone on 
for so long spinning silly young Williamb the yarn that he's a greater 
version of old Fritz0 that the lad is now taking it seriously and wants to 
be 'Emperor and Chancellor in one person'. Bismarck is presently 
letting him have his way in order that he may make a thorough ass of 
himself,  whereupon Bismarck will step into the breach as his guardian 
angel. Meanwhile he has assigned his Herbert^ to the insolent lad as spy 
and custodian. A row between the two will not be long in coming and 
then the fun will begin. 
In France the Radicals200  in the government are making bigger asses 
of themselves than one could have hoped for. They have renounced the 
whole of their old programme vis-à-vis the workers and are behaving 
like out and out Opportunists 199; they are pulling the chestnuts out of 
the fire for the Opportunists and doing their dirty work for them. That

would be quite splendid but for Boulanger and provided they weren't 
virtually forcing the masses into his arms. 137 As a person the man is not 
particularly dangerous but his popularity among the masses is driving 
the entire army over to the his side and that constitutes a grave danger— 
the temporary ascendancy of the said adventurer and, by way of an 
escape from his predicament, war.

ENGELS TO LOUISE KAUTSKY 301 
IN VIENNA 
[Draft] 
London, 11 October 1888 
My Dear, Dear Louise, 
Immediately after our return, your letter got into Tussy's hands and 
then went to Schorlemmer, from whom I have only just retrieved it. 
Hence the lateness of my reply.

224 Letters -1888 
The news, which Ede had already passed on to Nimmie, left us all 
thunderstruck. But when I read your letter, my mind positively reeled. 
You must know that, ever since we first met, my regard for you has 
constantly augmented and you have grown ever dearer to me. But all 
that is as nothing by comparison with the admiration aroused by your 
heroic and ineffably magnanimous letter—not only in myself but in all 
those who have read it— Nim, Tussy and Schorlemmer. Having just been 
dealt the most terrible blow a woman can possibly receive—at that very 
moment you muster sufficient aplomb to release the man whose hand 
was, after all, responsible for dealing the blow. And to relinquish such a 
noble-minded woman after five years—one's mind reels! 
You say there can be no question of guilt on KarlV part. Very well, 
you are the best judge of that, but it does not entitle the rest of us to do 
you an injustice. You speak of a divorce as the only possible solution, 
your characters being what they are. But if your characters had really 
been incompatible, this must needs have been apparent to us too and we 
should have long anticipated a divorce as something both natural and 
unavoidable. But let us suppose it to have been a case of true incompat­
ibility. Karl had wooed and won you in defiance of his family and yours, 
he knew what you had given up for his sake and, so far as we could tell, 
lived with you happily for five years. That being so, he should not have 
allowed himself to be flummoxed by what, to use your own expression, 
was a momentary unpleasantness. And if he was driven to take so 
extreme a step by a new and sudden onset of passion, he ought not to 
have taken that step impetuously, and should above all have avoided the 
remotest semblance of doing so under the influence of those who had 
objected to his union with you and who, perhaps, have not altogether 
forgiven you for becoming his wife. 
Of Karl you say that, in the absence of love or passion, his personal­
ity would go to pieces. If one of the traits of that personality is to require 
a new love every few years, he would surely be the first to admit that, in 
present-day circumstances, a personality of this kind has got to be kept 
in check if it is not to involve him and others in one long series of tragic 
conflicts. 
So much, dear Louise, I feel it behoves me to say. Apart from 
anything else, our social conditions are such as to make it positively easy 
for a man to do a woman a gross injustice, and how many men are there 
a Karl Kautsky

who can absolve themselves from all guilt in this respect? 'Go! You are 
not worthy of women!' as one of our greatest men once said, with a 
knowledge born of experience. And in reading your letter I could only 
re-echo his words. 
We cannot get the business out of our minds. Nim and I constantly 
revert to it as to something incomprehensible, impossible. One of these 
mornings, I told her, Karl will wake up as if out of a dream to find that 
he has committed the greatest folly of his life. And this is what seems to 
be actually happening if, as he wrote and told Ede, his new love has left 
him after having, within the first five days, fallen in love with his brother 
Hans and become engaged to him. 
We had all of us so much looked forward to seeing you here again and 
had been correspondingly cast down when we heard through Percy 
while in New York that you and Karl would be staying in Vienna for the 
winter. But neither Nim nor I can really take in the fact that we shall 
never see your dear face in this house again. Yet who knows what may 
not happen? Who knows whether, one of these days, you may not be 
sitting in the same old chair where you have so often sat before? 
Whatever happens, of one thing I can be sure—your courage will help 
you to overcome all difficulties and to emerge victorious from every 
struggle. My own and Nim's most cordial good wishes go with you. 
What we can do for you, we shall gladly do—we are at your beck and 
call and, should fate ever bring you here again, you must in all circum­
stances regard this house as your own. 
Yours, from all our hearts

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 13 October 1888 
My dear Laura, 
At last. The heap of letters which Paul foresaw would meet me here 
and which was indeed frightful, is mostly brushed away and I can sit 
down to write to you a few lines. 
And to begin with, a bit of gossip. When we arrived, the first news 
Nim told us, was that Kautsky and his wife were going to be divorced, 
that Kautsky had fallen in love with a girl in the Salzburg Alps, informed 
his wife of the fact, and Louise had set him free as far as she was 
concerned. We were all thunderstruck. However, a letter from Louise to 
me—a really heroic letter—confirmed the news, and with a generosity 
beyond all praise even acquitted Kautsky of all blame. We all of us here 
were very fond of Louise and could not make it out how Kautsky could 
be such a fool—and such a mean one; except that an intrigue was at the 
bottom, planned by his mother 3 and sisterb  (who both hated Louise) and 
that he had fallen into the trap. This seems indeed to have been the case, 
from all we can learn. The girl is a BezirksrichterY daughter, longing 
evidently for a husband and especially for one who will take her to 
Vienna. Kautsky flirted with her while his wife was in Vienna nursing 
her sick mother; and one fine morning the discovery was made that 
neither could live without the other—the sister, of course, working both 
puppets behind the scenes, while the mother pretended not to see 
anything. Well, Kautsky came here, told Bernstein, sold his furniture, 
took his books with him and returned, with his younger brother Hans, 
to St Gilgen near Salzburg, the scene of the above drama. When the 
youthful Bella (such is her name) saw the equally youthful Hans, a flot­
ter strammer Bursch, A she at once discovered that she had, in Karl, really 
loved Hans alone, and Hans reciprocated with the alacrity becoming to 
a young Viennese; within five days they were engaged and Karl found 
himself between two stools of his own setting. Karl in his generosity has

forgiven both, but the old mother fumes and threatens to forbid the 
young woman her house—and this throws a peculiar light, or rather 
shade, on her pretended innocence of the affair. 
Of course, now Kautsky discovers at once that he has lived unhappily 
with Louise for the last 12 months (that is since his mother and sister 
were here and spent a month with them at the Isle of Wight) and Ede 
Bernstein will also have noted some disharmony when he came from 
Switzerland. This is all the more curious that during this time when he 
could not agree with her, we all here liked her all the better, the longer 
we knew her; which proves that she is not only a heroic woman, for that 
she is undoubtedly (and such are certainly not always the best for 
domestic use), but a woman with whom reasonable people can get on. 
Well I think and said to Nim: this is the greatest Dummheit Kautsky ever 
committed in his life and I do not envy him the moralischen Kater* 
which will be the upshot (sans calembourg\ h) of it all. 
The matter is up to the present kept quiet. Here only Ede Bernstein 
and his wife, Nim, and Schorlemmer know about it, also Tussy and 
Edward, and probably one or two of Louise's and Tussy's common lady 
friends. How it will all end, I do not know, but I guess Kautsky wishes 
it was all a dream. 
Now to business. Enclosed account of Capital, for the last 12 months, 
according to which I owe you £2.8s.9d, and as you must be by this time 
pretty short of cash I add £15—making the cheque £17.8s.9d in all. 
Nim informs me dinner is getting ready and so I stop short, using the 
rest of the page for the account. Love from Nim and your old General.

ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON 211 
IN ST PETERSBURG 
London, 15 October 1888 
Dear Sir, 
I was prevented from replying to your kind letters of 8/20 January 
and 3/15 June—as also to a great many other letters—first by a weakness 
of my eyes which made it impossible for me to write at my desk for 
more than two hours a day, and thus necessitated an almost complete 
neglect of work and correspondence, and second by a journey to 
America during August and September from which I am only just 
returned. My eyes are better but as I now shall take in hand Volume IIP 
and finish it, I must still be careful not to overwork them, and conse­
quently my friends must excuse me if my letters are not too long and not 
too frequent. 
The disquisitions in your first letter on the relation between rate of 
surplus value and rate of profits are highly interesting and no doubt of 
great value for grouping statistics; but it is not in this way that our 
authorb attacks the problem. You suppose, in your formula, that every 
manufacturer keeps all the surplus value, which he, in the first hand 
appropriates. Now upon that supposition, merchant's capital and 
banker's capital would be impossible, because they would not make any 
profit. The profit of a manufacturer therefore cannot represent all the 
surplus value he has extracted from his workmen.

Letters -18S8 229 
On the other hand, your formula may serve to calculate, approxi­
mately, the composition of different capitals in different industries, 
under the rule of a common and equal rate of profit. I say may, because 
I have not at this moment materials at hand from which to verify the 
theoretical formula established by you. 
You wonder why in England political economy is in such a pitiful 
state.  It is the same everywhere; even classical economy, nay, even the 
most vulgar Free Trade Hausierburschen 3- are looked upon with 
contempt by the still more vulgar 'superior' beings who fill the univer­
sity chairs of economy. That is the fault of our author, to a great extent; 
he has taught people to see the dangerous consequences of classical 
economy; they find that no science at all, on this field at least, is the safe 
side of the question. And they have so well succeeded in blinding the 
ordinary philistine, that there are at the present moment four people in 
London, calling themselves 'Socialist' 302 who claim to have refuted our 
author completely by opposing to his theory that of—Stanley Jevons!215 
Paris friends insist upon saying that Mr Mutualb is not dead;216 I have 
no means of testing their information. 
I have read with great interest your physiological observations upon 
exhaustion by prolonged labour time and the quantity of potential 
energy in the shape of food required to replace the exhaustion. To the 
statement of Ranke quoted by you c I have to make a slight exception: if 
the 1,000,000  kgmetres in food merely replaced the amount of heat and 
mechanical work done, it will still be insufficient, for it does not then 
replace the wear and tear of muscle and nerve; for that not only heat-
producing food is required but albumen and this cannot be measured in 
kgmetres alone, as the animal body is incapable of building it up from 
the elements. 
I do not know the two books of Ed. Young and Phil. Bevan,d but 
there must be some mistake in the statement that spinners and weavers 
in the Cotton Industry in America receive $90-120 a year. That repre­
sents $2- a week,—8/- sterling, but in reality equals, in purchasing 
power, less than 5/- in England. From all I have heard, the wages of spin­
ners and weavers in America are nominally higher but in reality only

fully equal to those in England; that would make them about $5-6 a week, 
corresponding to 12/- to 16/- in England. Remember that spinners and 
weavers now are all women or boys of 15-18 years. As to Kautsky's state­
ment, he made the mistake of treating dollars as if they were pounds ster­
ling; in order to reduce them to marks, he multiplied by 20 instead of by 
5, thus obtaining fourfold the correct amount. The figures from the 
Census {Compendium of the 10th census of the United States, 1880, 
Washington,  1883; a p.1125, specific Cotton Manufacture) are: 
Operatives and officers 174,659 
Deduct clerks, managers etc. 2.115 
172.544 operatives 
(Men 59,685 (over 16 years) 
boys 16,107 (under 16 years) 
women 84,539 (over 15 years) 
girls 13,213 (under 15 years)) 
172,544. total wages $42,040,510 or $243.06 per head per annum, 
which agrees with my estimate given above, as what the men get more 
will be made up by what girls and boys get less. 
To prove to you to what depths of degradation economical science has 
fallen, Lujo Brentano has published a lecture on Die Klassische 
Nationalökonomie (Leipzig, 1888), in which he proclaims: general or theo­
retical economy is worth noting, but special or practical economy is every­
thing. Like natural science (!), we must limit ourselves to the description of 
facts;  such descriptions are of infinitely higher value than all apriori deduc­
tions.  'Like natural science'! That is impayable in the century of Darwin, of 
Mayer, Joule and Clausius, of evolution and the transformation of energy! 
Thanks for the No. of Russkiye Vedomosti with the interesting article 
on the interference with the statistical work of the Zemstvos. It is a great 
pity that this valuable work should be interrupted. 
Very sincerely yours

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN VIENNA 
London, 17 October 1888 
Dear Kautsky, 
In reply to your letter, I can only begin by repeating what I have 
already written and told Louise,a that my mind reels at the thought of 
what has happened between you two. If there had been any serious 
discord, this must have been apparent, however slightly, to us over here, 
particularly when you were at Dodwell with the Avelings. But no one 
noticed a thing—except Ede. 
You yourself say that Louise likewise refused to admit as much and, 
in view of the remarkable magnanimity of which she has given proof 
throughout, I can only assume that she feels and believes what she says. 
However, it could be that you are both right. According to you, your 
dissatisfaction began over a year ago. That takes you back more or less 
to your time in Ventnor. Your relations never approved of your 
marriage. From my experience of my own family I know how difficult 
and, for a time, impossible, it is for parents to do justice to a daughter-
or son-in-law who has come into the family against their wishes. For all 
that, the parents are conscious of having the best of intentions, the only 
result of which is, as a rule, to pave the streets of hell for their son- or 
daughter-in-law and, indirectly, for their own child. Every husband has 
something to criticise in his wife, and vice versa; that is as it should be. 
But as a result of well-meaning Ingerentzk by third parties, this critical 
attitude may be exacerbated to the point of resentment if not lasting 
discord. If this is what has happened in your case, you are both of you 
right: Louise in saying that there is no cause for discord between you, 
you in saying that your relationship is, in fact, discordant. 
But if the discord—no matter what the reason for it—was so grave 
that you seriously contemplated divorce, what you should have borne in 
mind above all was, I should say, the differing status of husband and wife 
in present-day conditions. No social stigma whatever attaches to the 
a See this volume, pp.223-5 - b intervention 

=====第243页=====
232 Letters-1888 
husband as a result of divorce; his position in life remains intact and he 
simply reverts to bacherlorhood. The wife loses her status altogether; she 
has got to begin all over again and do so under more difficult circum­
stances. Hence, if a wife speaks of a divorce, the husband may beg or 
implore or do anything else he likes without demeaning  himself,  whereas 
if the husband so much as hints at a divorce, the wife, if she has any  self-
respect, is all but compelled to take him instantly at his word. It follows 
that only in an extreme case, only after mature reflection and when he is 
absolutely clear in his mind as to its necessity, should the husband take 
this extreme step, and then only in the most considerate manner possible. 
Again, profound discord cannot occur without both parties being 
aware of it. And you know Louise well enough to realise that in such an 
event she would have been the first to release both herself and you. If, 
however, you were intent on making the first move, then surely you 
owed it to Louise to do so while in full command of your faculties and 
not in a state of euphoria such as you were in at St Gilgen, and which 
was destined to evaporate so soon. 
Enough. As I have said, the thing's utterly inconceivable to all of us 
except Ede. While you were becoming dissatisfied with Louise, she was 
acquiring one friend after another here, and we were growing fonder of 
her every day, and envying you for being married to her. And I still 
maintain that this is the silliest thing you have ever done. 
You say you think that you'll have to stay in Vienna. Of that you are, 
of course, the best judge. In your place I should feel impelled to with­
draw for the time being into relative solitude, away from all the inter­
ested parties, in order to get a clear idea of the nature and implications of 
what has happened. 
And that's enough of that. Your news about the state of the party in 
Austria is not particularly edifying, although hardly unexpected. Strife 
between nationalities is still too deeply engrained, even in the mass of the 
workers, to permit of a general surge forward, and that will take time. Of 
the 3 groups you mention, the Alpine provinces hardly come into it— 
except for Vienna, which I do not count. The chaps in Brno have the 
great advantage of being an international group. Finally, the bickering 
about leadership only goes to show—just as it does over here—that the 
masses as a whole are not yet in process of going over to the party, that 
everything's proceeding too slowly, which is why everyone tries to put 
the blame on someone else, while hoping that this or that panacea will 
produce better results.303 Your only course is to be patient, and I'm glad 
that I needn't have anything to do with the business.

I must now get down seriously to Volume III.a  Otherwise I'd do you 
something for the Neue Zeit about my experiences in America 304; but I 
am unlikely to find the time—I have already spent more than a fortnight 
over correspondence, going through what has come in, etc. My sight has 
temporarily improved, but what it will be like when I have to go back 
into harness remains to be seen. I shall be seeing the eye specialist again 
tomorrow.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 25 October 1888 
Dear Bebel, 
I have sent you through Schlüter Der Hülferuf der deutschen Jugend 
together with its sequel, Die Junge Generation, Weitling's periodical of 
the forties. Schlüter had got the other stuff and has sent it to you; the 
Garantien, Das Evangelium des armen Sünders, etc. 305 
In my view, it would be better to distinguish between the 3 trends in 
the German movement during the forties. There is very little connection 
between them, Weitlingian communism 306 in particular having remained 
aloof until it fizzled out or its members came over to us—a phase which 
does not figure in the literature on the subject. As regards the history of 
a of Capital 

=====第245页=====
234 Letters- 1888 
'true socialism'307  (Hess up to a point, Grün and a number of other 
belletrists), the material in the archives 227 is far from complete, and use 
would have to be made besides of Marx's and my old mss.a Which, 
however, I can in no circumstances allow out of my possession. Again, a 
great deal of what went on behind the scenes—notably the estrangement 
between Hess and ourselves—and what cannot be dismissed in a couple 
of lines, would be indispensable here, and this would mean that I myself 
would have to go through all the old stuff again. Finally, as regards the 
third trend—our own—the course of its development can be studied 
nowhere save in the old mss., while its outward history was recorded by 
me in the introduction13 to the Communist Trial.0 Weitlingian commu­
nism, on the other hand, is a subject all on its own and accounts of it are 
available in print. 
Here it occurs to me that you ought also, perhaps, to have 
Kuhlmann's book—the prophetic religion that succeeded Weitling in 
Switzerland and to which many of his followers were converted. 308 I 
completely forgot to give it to Schlüter. 
I enclose a letter from Weitling to Hess (from the archives). It was at 
a meeting of a small band of close associates that the breach between 
Weitling and ourselves took place. (An account of the said meeting, writ­
ten by Annenkov, a Russian who was present, also appeared in the Neue 
Zeit a few years ago.) 309 What happened was as follows: Hess had been 
to Westphalia (Bielefeld, etc.); the chaps there— Lüning, Rempel et al— 
wished, he said, to put up the money for the publication of our writ­
ings. 310 Then Weitling came up with the proposal that his disquisitions 
re his Utopian system be placed with them forthwith, as also his other 
great works (including a new grammar in which the dative was abolished 
as the invention of aristocrats) 311—things we would have had to criticise 
and combat the moment the plan came off. The letter shows the 
distorted form in which our arguments were reflected in Weitling's 
mind. Everywhere he saw nothing but professional jealousy, nothing but 
an attempt to suppress his genius, to 'come between him and the sources 
of money'. But in points 5 and 6 of his resume the fundamental differ­
ence between him and ourselves emerges plainly enough, and that's the 
main thing.312 
P. 3, lines 10-12: This refers to our intention of bringing out the great

Utopians in German translation with critical introductions and notes—as 
opposed to the piffling accounts by Lorenz Stein, Grün 313 et al. In this 
poor Weitling sees only unfair competition with his system. 
P. 3, bottom: E. is Ewerbeck in Paris. 
N.B.  It finally transpired that Mosesa had omitted to tell us the essen­
tials,  namely that all the Westphalians had offered was to guarantee other 
publishers against the  losses  they might make on our  stuff.  Moses had led 
us to believe that they, the Westphalians, would themselves undertake 
publication. As soon as we learnt what the position was, we naturally 
washed our hands of the whole business; to be writers guaranteed by the 
Westphalians was something that would never have occurred to us. 
The affair of the Kautskys has astonished us all. Louise has conducted 
herself throughout with exceptional heroism. Kautsky was in a state of 
complete euphoria but was sadly sobered down when jilted within 5 
days by his new beloved, who thereupon got engaged to his brother 
Hans.  Now they both intend to wait and see how things go; the strangest 
part of it is that Louise is now complaining how unfair we are all being 
to Karl! I have written and told Kautsky that it's the silliest thing he has 
ever done and, if Louise thinks this too unkind, I suppose I shall have to 
return my sword to its scabbard. 
I am now working on Volume III of Capital. I am still supposed to 
take great care of my eyes and not write for more than 2 hours daily and 
that only by daylight. So my correspondence will have to be severely 
curtailed. 
Regards to Singer.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 274 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 24 November 1888 
My dear Laura, 
I was going to write two lines to Paul just when your letter3 arrived. 
I have been busy with a very important chapter in Book IIIb which I 
have had to re-write entirely, the materials left by Mohr being all in the 
rought, and as it is a mathematical one, it required much attention.314 
And when one has only two daily fragments of IV2 hours each allowed 
for work by the doctor, a thing which otherwise could be settled in 14 
days takes more than 6 weeks—and so I determined to do it all before I 
allowed myself any interruption for correspondence. Well, the main 
portion is finished to-day and so I can just send a line to ask Paul to let 
me know as usual when he wants any money and I will do what I can. 
As soon as my chapter is definitely got rid of, I shall write again—I 
have such a lot of letter-debts!—in the meantime hope to get the Figaro 
to-night, so far it has not come. The position in France seems indeed 
very curious—our friends have allowed themselves by their hatred of the 
Radicals200  to take Boulanger too little au sérieux and find now that he 
is a real danger 137—anyhow he has the lower ranks of the army on his 
side and that is a power not to be disdained. And anyhow the way the 
fellow not only accepts but courts the support of the monarchists makes 
him more contemptible in my eyes than even the Radicals. Let us hope 
that the conscious breaches of logic committed by all parties—but then 
one must not forget that the form of all unconscious development is the 
Negation der Negation, 0 the movement by contrasts, and that this in 
France means Republicanism (or respectively Socialism) and 
Bonapartism (or Boulangism). And Boulanger 's avènement^ would be a 
European war—the very thing most to be feared.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 4 December 1888 
My dear Lafargue, 
I have just finished editing a very important chapter in Volume III," a 
chapter Marx left uncompleted—and a mathematical chapter at that,314 
in order to cope with it I have had to set aside all other occupations, 
notably letter-writing. Hence my silence. 
Bernstein has sent your article to Bebel to find out what he thinks of 
it. As for me, my advice to you would be to withdraw it. The things you 
say in your historical introduction are common knowledge and we are 
all of one mind about them. But when you come to the Possibilists,19 all 
you do is to say they've sold themselves to the government, and this 
without the slightest proof or even circumstantial evidence. If you 
haven't anything else to say about them, it would be better to say noth­
ing at all.316  Had you given an account of all the dirty tricks they 
allegedly played on the Municipal Council and on the Bourse du 
Travail 317 affairs, and had then gone on to provide facts and reasons in 
support of your assertion of their venality, it might have amounted to 
a of Capital

something. But the bald assertion that they sold themselves cuts no ice 
whatsoever. 
Don't forget that, in reply, these gentry will say that you have sold 
yourselves to the Boulangists. There is no denying the fact that your atti­
tude to Boulangism has done you tremendous harm in the eyes of 
Socialists outside France.277 You have coquetted and flirted with the 
Boulangists out of hatred of the Radicals200  when you might easily have 
attacked both, thus leaving no room for ambiguity regarding the inde­
pendence of your position vis-à-vis the two parties. Nothing forced you 
to choose between these two sets of nincompoops. You could have 
cocked a snook at one no less than at the other. But instead, you made 
much of the Boulangists, you even mentioned the possibility of sharing 
an electoral roll with them at the next elections—with people allied to 
the Bonapartists and Royalists, who are certainly no better than Mr 
Brousse's Radical allies! If you have been seduced by the attitude of the 
Blanquists 318 who, idealists though they be, are also circumspect in their 
dealings with Boulanger because of the money received from Rochefort, 
you ought to have known 'those idealists', since we used to have some 
in London too. 
You say it is necessary for the people to personify their aspirations— 
if that were true, the French would be Bonapartists from birth, in which 
case we might as well shut up shop in Paris. But even if you did so 
believe, would it be reason enough to take the said Bonapartists under 
your wing? 
Boulanger, you say, doesn't want war. What the poor fellow wants is 
neither here nor there! He has to do what the situation demands, 
whether he likes it or not. Once in power, he'll be a slave to his chau­
vinist programme, the only programme he's got, aside from his accession 
to power. Within less than six weeks Bismarck will have enmeshed him 
in a web of complications, provocations and frontier incidents, etc. Then 
Boulanger will either have to declare war or else abdicate; have you any 
doubt what his choice will be? Boulanger spells war, nothing could be 
more certain. And what war? France allied to Russia, and hence no 
possibility of revolution; the least movement in Paris, and the Tsar a 
would so arrange things with Bismarck as to stifle revolutionary ardour 
for good and all; worse still, once war had been embarked upon, the Tsar 
would be absolute master of France and would impose on you what 
a Alexander III

Letters-1888 239 
government he chose. Hence to throw yourselves into Boulanger's arms 
out of hatred for the Radicals is one and the same thing as throwing 
yourselves, out of hatred for Bismarck, into the arms of the Tsar. Is it 
really so difficult to make yourself say that they both of them stink, as 
Queen Blanka says in Heinea? 
I don't know what Liebknecht may have done about the Possibilists. 
Whatever the case, I feel sure that our party in Germany could hardly 
bring itself to attend the Possibilist congress 319 and, if it did, this could 
only be as the result of grave mistakes on your part. But do not forget 
that the Possibilists have succeeded in posing as the official representa­
tives of French socialism, that they are recognised as such by the 
English,269 the Americans and the Belgians, that they fraternised at the 
London Congress320 with the Dutch and the Danes because you, having 
abdicated, were not represented there. If you do nothing in the way of 
advertising and preparing for your 1889 congress,321 everybody will 
attend that of the Broussists, there being no following for those who 
abdicate. So advertise your congress, make a bit of to-do in the socialist 
press of all countries, so that others may realise that the little chap's still 
alive and kicking. And if your Troyes322 Congress is successful—and 
succeed it must, for otherwise your party will be done for—beat the big 
drum, have a central committee that bestirs itself and to which people 
may refer and, if possible, have a little weekly paper which will give the 
world proof of your existence. And make a clean break with the 
Boulangists, otherwise no one will come. 
Circumstances permitting, Liebknecht will have his congress—any 
old congress—provided he himself is there. And if your congress seems 
to him to offer little chance of success, he'll go to the Possibilist one. I'll 
do what I can to see that others are informed; Bebel already has been, 
by Bernstein, who will himself write about the Possibilists in the 
Sozialdemokrat! 0 But he hasn't the power to bind the Party. 
Has Liebknecht been in touch with you, and what did you reply? 
That's what I must know if I am to act in accordance with the facts. 
Last Sunday Anseele and Van Beveren came to see me, and who do 
you think was with them? Adolphe Smith-Headingly! Needless to say, 
I lost no time in showing him the door. Can you imagine such impu­
dence!

Dear Mr Walter, 
The first time you wrote to me I knew nothing about you and hence 
could take no more account of your letter than of the many others on a 
similar subject which I receive from strangers. 
You now refer to Most from which I must conclude that you belong 
to the anarchists. But as long as the weight of the anarchists' attack is 
directed at our embattled party in Germany rather than at the common 
enemy, my resources will be devoted to the victims of persecution at the 
hands of the German governments, and it cannot be expected of me that 
I should support people who maintain a hostile stance towards my 
friends and party comrades in Germany and elsewhere. 
In no circumstances would I be capable of getting the broker out of 
your house. 
If, however, I should be mistaken about your political affiliations, 
you will have no difficulty in establishing your bona fides with my old 
friend Lessner, 12 Fitzroy St, in which case I shall be happy to do some-

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 324 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 2 January 1889 
My dear Laura, 
All our best wishes for the New Year to yourself and Paul! 
We got into it in a very queer way—we went as usual to Pumps' in a 
cab, the fog was thickening—in Belsize Road we stuck fast—the man 
had to lead the horse; by and bye that was not sufficient; a man with a 
lantern took hold of the horse and led; after a full hour's drive in the dark 
and cold we arrived at Pumps' where we found Sam Moore, Tussy and 
the Schlüters (Edward never turned up) and also Tauschen Dinner of 
course was an hour late in consequence of our adventure. Well, it got 
blacker and blacker, and when the New Year came, the air was as thick 
as pea-soup. No chance of getting away; our cabman, ordered for one 
o'clock, never arrived, and so the whole lot had to stop where they were. 
So we went on drinking, singing, card-playing and laughing till half-past 
five, when Sam and Tussy were escorted by Percy to the station and 
caught the first train; about seven the others left, and it cleared up a little; 
Nim slept with Pumps, Schorlemmer and I in the spare bed, Percy in the 
nursery (it was after seven when we went to sleep) and got up again at 
out 12 or  1 to return to Pilsener etc.; the sun shone brightly on a beauti­
fully frozen ground. The spree agreed with all of us most amazingly and 
none of us is any the worse for the bout. The others drank coffee about 
half past four, but I stuck to claret till seven. 
I am glad to hear that the Boulangitis was a personal affection of 
Paul's though the Parti ouvrier pretends that Guesde and Deville have 
given in to him. 325 What you say about the Possibilists we are 
perfectly agreed on,326 but I was bound to place before you and Paul 

=====第255页=====
244 Letters-1889 
the excuses which Liebknecht and others—for instance the Belgians— 
may draw from the tender treatment the Boulangists undoubtedly 
have had from our side. All I insisted on from the beginning, and all 
Paul declined to let me have, was a clear and unmistakeable assurance 
that the Boulangists should be treated as bourgeois enemies quite as 
much as the Cadettists. 327 For under no circumstances could I encour­
age our German friends to attend a congress the convokers of which 
had so far forgotten the old traditional policy of the proletariat as to 
coquet with a bourgeois party, et encore un parti tel que les 
boulangistes.* 
Well, the impending Paris election must bring our people to their 
senses—that was my first thought on Hude's death,328 and indeed the 
Troyes Congress has taken at least one step in the right direction by 
proclaiming the necessity of an independent socialist candidature329  (I 
hope Vaillant 's who seems to me at present the only one to unite a certain 
number of suffrages, as our own people appear to be quite out of the race 
at this moment). But no paper says what the other resolutions of the 
Congress are; there have been individual anti-Boulangist pronunciamen-
tos (though none of Paul's that I saw) but nothing on the part of the 
Congress officially except the above resolution. 
Now Liebknecht will come to Paris about middle of January 330 and I 
have to write to Bebel in a few days.b  Therefore if Paul wishes me to act 
in the interest of their congress, he must enable me to do so by a clear 
and unequivocal declaration as to what our people may expect of him 
and the others with regard to the Boulanger mania. And the sooner the 
better, there is not much time to lose. 
I have never doubted the really anti-chauvinist character of the 
Marxists, but that was the very reason why I could not conceive how 
they could think of an alliance open or disguised with a party which lives 
upon chauvinism almost alone. I never asked more than the open 
acknowledgment that Cadettists and Boulangists, dass sie alle beide 
stinken, 0 surely such a self-understood thing I ought to have had long 
ago! Also the Troyes resolutions I ought to have. 
If there has been an idea of getting some of our people into the 
Chamber by having them placed on the Boulangist list, that would be far 
worse than not getting into the Chamber at all. After all, if the poor old 
a and, moreover, a party like the Boulangists - b See next letter - c that both of 
them stink (Heine, 'Disputation', Romanzero)

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN BERLIN 
London, 5 January 1889 
Dear Bebel, 
First of all let me heartily reciprocate your kind New Year's wishes. 
Today, fog permitting, I must write to you by request concerning two 
delicate matters. Both have to do with the fear that Liebknecht might 
commit the party to a not altogether desirable course when, as has been 
announced, he visits London and Paris 330 (if he comes on bis own, that 
is), nor, in view of his dependence on passing moods (which again is 
often due to self-deception), can I altogether disagree with the chaps. 
In Paris it is a question of the congress or rather two congresses—the 
Possibilists' and our own, in other words the international congress 
decided upon at the Trades Unions Congress in Bordeaux in November331 
and again at the Socialist Congress in Troyes.329  Lafargue is afraid that 
Liebknecht has had dealings with the Possibilists and that you might 
perhaps send delegates to their congress. I have written and told Lafargue* 
that in my view you cannot possibly do this. The Possibilists, having joined 

=====第257页=====
246 Letters -1889 
in mortal combat with our people, the so-called Marxists, have now set 
themselves up as the one true church which absolutely prohibits any inter­
course, any cooperation with the others—Marxists no less than 
Blanquists—and have formed an alliance with the one true church over 
here (the Social Democratic Federation269 ), an alliance not the least of 
whose aims is to oppose the German Party everywhere so long  as it refuses 
to join this unsavoury league and cease associating with other Frenchmen 
and Englishmen. Moreover, the Possibilists have sold themselves to the 
present government, their fares, congress expenses and periodicals are paid 
for out of secret funds, and all this on the pretext of combating Boulanger 
and defending the republic, hence also France's Opportunist exploiters, the 
Ferrys, etc., their present allies. 199 And they defend the present Radical 
government which, in order to remain in office, must do all the 
Opportunists' dirty work for them, a government which ordered an assault 
on the people on the occasion of Eudes' funeral 332 and in Bordeaux and 
Troyes, just as in Paris, is more rabid in its opposition to the red flag than 
any government before it. To go along with this gang would be a denial of 
your entire foreign policy to date. Two years ago in Paris the same lot made 
common cause with the venal English trades unions against the socialist 
demands333 and if they took a different stand over here in November,320 it 
was because they had no alternative. Moreover, it is only in Paris that they 
are strong; in the provinces they're a negligible quantity, proof of this being 
that they cannot hold a congress in Paris because the provinces would 
either stay away or prove hostile. Nor are they able to hold one in the 
provinces. Two years ago they went to a little place tucked away in the 
Ardennes334 ; this year they expected to find accommodation in Troyes, 
where several of the labour town councillors, having betrayed their class 
after the election, had joined them. But they were not re-elected and the 
comité —their own comité —extended an invitation to all French Socialists. 
Thereupon, dismay in the Paris camp; an attempt to rescind this—in vain. 
And so they didn't go to their own congress, which was taken over and 
brilliantly run by our Marxists. What the provincial trades unions think of 
them can be seen from the enclosed resolution passed at the Bordeaux 
Trades Unions Congress in November. On the Paris Municipal Council 
they have 9 men, whose main purpose it is to oppose, on no matter what 
pretext, Vaillant's socialist activities, to betray the workers and in return to 
secure not only grants of money for themselves and their supporters but 
also sole control of the labour exchanges. 317

The Marxists, who control the provinces, are the only anti-chauvinist 
party in France; the stand they have taken on behalf of the German 
labour movement has made them unpopular in Paris, and to send dele­
gates to a congress there that is hostile to these people would be to cut 
off your nose to spite your own face. They also know how best to comb 
at Boulanger, 326 who stands for the general feeling of dissatisfaction in 
France. When Boulanger wanted to hold a banquet in Montluçon, our 
people took 300 tickets so as to put to him through Dormoy—a most 
able little chap—some highly categorical questions about his attitude to 
the labour movement, etc. When the worthy general learned of this, he 
cancelled the whole banquet. 
The fog precludes any further writing today. More in a day or two.

As regards the French peasants, the thing should be taken cum grano 
salis. 3- The cultivation of parcels of land was the rule in France as it was 
in Germany and Eastern Europe while, so far as acreage is concerned, 
farming on a large scale with corvée labour was relatively rare. As a 
result of the Revolution, 335 the peasant gradually came into possession 
of his parcel of land, but he often for some time at least remained a nomi­
nal tenant (without as a rule having to pay rent). What happened to 
state-owned land (much of which Napoleon and the Restoration336 
returned to the aristocracy, the other part of it being purchased after 
1826 by the aristocracy with the help of the émigré milliard 337), and how, 
by 1830, small peasant landownership had reached its highest degree of 
development, is to be found in Avenel's Lundis Révolutionnaires and 
Balzac's novel, Les Paysans. Taine isn't up to much. b I haven't read the

My health was given a tremendous fillip by my American jaunt, but

ENGELS TO CONRAD SCHMIDT 4 
IN ZURICH 
London, 11 January 1889 
Dear Sir, 
I am in receipt of your two letters of 5 November and 28/31 
December and have followed with much interest the progress of your 
experimentation with German universities.339 The domination of the 
Junkers in alliance with the bourgeois differs from the pre-'48 domina­
tion of the Junkers in alliance with the bureaucrats only in having a 
broader basis. In those days their treatment of Bruno Bauer295 stirred up 
indignation throughout Philistia; today, when similar treatment is being 
meted out to Diihring,340 and the doors of all the universities are being 
slammed in your face, that self-same Philistia considers it perfectly right 
and proper. 
You will, in fact, have no other recourse than to take up writing, and 
for that purpose there is, of course, no better place in the Empire than 
Berlin. I am glad that you say no more (in your second letter) about your 
American plans, for you would have experienced a bitter disappointment 
over there. I can see that anyone subject to the Anti-Socialist Law52  might 
think highly of the American-German socialist press, particularly from 
the viewpoint of a journalist. In actual fact it isn't up to much, either from 
the theoretical or from the local, American standpoint. The best paper is 
the Philadelphia Tageblatt; the St Louis Tageblatt is well-meaning but 
feeble; the New Yorker Volkszeitung is managed in a proper, businesslike 
way, but is first and foremost a business; the Sozialist (New York), the 
official organ of the German party, is very poor. Just now there is little 
place in America for theoretical thinkers. The Germans—at any rate in 
their official organisation—insist upon remaining a branch of the 
German metropolitan party, look down with a truly Lassallean arrogance 
upon the 'ignorant' Americans and expect them to join their German 
party, i.e. place themselves under German tutelage—in short, they behave 
with sectarian pettiness and bigotry. Further inland things are better, but 
the New Yorkers still retain the upper hand. I seldom see the Chicagoer 
Arbeiter-Zeitung (now edited by Christensen). In America, in short, the 
only possible openings are in the daily press, and you would have to be

over there for at least a year in order to gain the necessary confidence and 
personal insights; in addition you would have to adapt yourself to the 
prevailing opinions, which are often all the more parochial for the persis­
tence amongst the Germans there of that loutish mentality which, in 
Germany, has been eradicated by large-scale industry (one of the curious 
things about America is that what is most antiquated and out of date 
continues to vegetate happily alongside what is newest and most revolu­
tionary). Things can and will, no doubt, improve within a year or two, 
but anyone who wishes to promote the scientific side will find a far 
better prepared public here in Europe. 
Incidentally, you will also find that a career as a writer offers ample 
scope for worthwhile work. You will presumably have access to Braun's 
Archiv/ Conrad's Jahrbücher etc., b and to Schmoller's collection of 
papers. 341 For instance, a work on the system of exploitation by middle­
men (sweating system)—at least as prevalent in the Berlin garment trade 
as in that of London, etc.—would be very useful as providing a parallel 
to the English Report by the Select Committee of the House of Lords0— 
which I will gladly send you if you'd care to have it. Many other types 
of economic conditions would similarly reward investigation and 
description, quite aside from actual theoretical works, which might now 
and then provide relief from the common run of writing. We can discuss 
this further once you are in Berlin and have started work. 
If your experiences (which might well be worth publishing) recall the 
time of Frederick William IV, those of Hoch hark back directly to the 
worst period of demagogue-hunting. 342 It must surely be the first time 
since 1835 that anyone has been refused matriculation because of his 
political views. 
As regards Volume III,d  Section I (of seven) is ready for the press, and 
I am busy with II and III, which I hope to finish shortly. The work is

London, 12 January 1889 
Dear Sorge, 
A very Happy New Year and my most cordial greetings to you and 
your wife.0 
Have got your letter of 29 December. I am sorry to hear that you as 
well as your wife are beginning to find the work a strain. But I hope this 
is only a passing phase and that you will gradually get used to it. I am 
well, but during the ghastly December fogs my eyes got rather worse 
again. I have pretty well sorted that out by taking more exercise and 
spending more time out of doors. 
The chief characteristic of European socialism just now is 
contentiousness. In France the Possibilists have sold themselves to the 
government and are using the secret funds to keep their unsaleable news 
a willy-nilly - b That's London life for you - c  Katharina Sorge

papers afloat; at the elections on the 27th they will vote for the bourgeois 
Jacques, while our people and the Blanquists have put up Boulé, 344 of 
whom Lafargue believes that he will get no more than 16 to 20 thousand 
votes,  and this they regard as a defeat. In the provinces, on the other 
hand, things are healthier. The Possibilists had convoked their congress 
at Troyes, but cancelled it when the local organisers issued an invitation 
to all Socialists. 322 So only our lot went, proving there that, if Paris was 
dominated by the Possibilists, the provinces were theirs. Now there are 
going to be 2 congresses (international ones) in Paris this year—ours and 
the Possibilists'. The Germans probably won't go to either. 
Here in London the tuck3 of an army of officers sans soldiers still goes 
on. It's like Robert Blum's column of 1849345—one colonel, 11 officers, 
1 trumpeter and  1 private. Outwardly and before the public they appear 
to hit it off all right but the cliquishness behind the scenes is all the 
greater. Every now and again the bickering comes out into the open. 
Thus Champion, having been thrown out of the Social Democratic 
Federation,62 has founded a paperb  (of which one No. goes off to you 
this week) and is now attacking Hyndman, but more especially his ally, 
Adolphe Smith Headingley, who is half French, swears by the 
Possibilists and is chief mediator in the Hyndman-Possibilist alliance. In 
the days after the Commune, the fellow was co-loafer c of the London 
Branche  française 1**' by whom we were abused and misrepresented, then 
ditto of the pseudo-General Council consisting of Jung, Hales & Co. I 
have evidence that he is still telling lies about us. This lout-interpreter at 
the international Trades Congress over here had the effrontery to come 
to my house one Sunday under the aegis of Anseele and Van Beveren d; 
when Schlüter arrives, he will tell you how I sent the fellow packing. 
As soon as the working class, as yet only just stirring, really gets 
under way here, every one of these gentry will be relegated to his level 
and station—some inside, some outside the movement. It's now at the 
tooth-cutting stage. 
Contentiousness also prevails in the office of the Sozialdemokrat. 
Schlüter will be able to tell you about it. By the way, he is also to some 
extent party to it and capable of concealing what doesn't suit his book. 
When I see how badly mismanaged the paper is here at headquarters, I 
can only admire our workingmen the more for the way in which they 
counterbalance and neutralise it all.

Mother Wischnewetzky is much offended because, instead of paying 
her a visit at Long Branch, I stayed with you so as to recuperate from my 
indisposition and get back into shape for the voyage. She seems to have 
been pained by the breach of etiquette and the want of gallantry towards 
ladies.  However, I refuse to allow these little madams, who clamour for 
women's rights, to demand gallantry into the bargain—if they want the 
same rights as men they should submit to being treated as such. She will 
probably simmer down however. 
We spent New Year's Eve with Pumps and, because of the fog, had to 
stay the whole night tippling there. Tussy only left at 5 a.m. by the first 
train. She is now staying in Cornwall for a week or two. 
Bismarck has been nicely cuffed over the ears by Geffcken and 
Morier. 347 If the Supreme Court has not yet gone so far as to accept his 
undergraduate-bully boy's version of the penal code, this is thanks to the 
singular contempt with which young William a lately favoured those 
gentlemen at Leipzig. 
Diplomatic intrigue is at its height. The Russians have received 20 
million pounds,348  in April the Prussians will get their new 8 mm maga­
zine rifle (the 11 mm one—a new version of the Mauser—was utterly 
unsuitable for war), the Austrians are boasting like mad, claiming to be 
prêts et  archiprêts,* 0 which proves that they're ready for another drub­
bing, and in France Boulanger might come to the helm. Bismarck's 
machinations with Salisbury in East Africa 349 have only one purpose, 
namely to involve Britain so deeply in a joint operation with Germany 
that, even under Gladstone, it wouldn't be able to draw back. Thus it 
was definitely against his will that William staged the Morier affair, but 
it's he who has to carry the can. In short, the situation is becoming crit­
ical and could lead to war in the spring.

ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY 10 
IN NEW YORK 
London,  12 January 1889 
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, 
No doubt you feel disappointed at my having left America281  without 
coming to see you at your sea-side retreat. But I was really too unwell, 
while in New York, to attempt an excursion of any kind—as you are aware 
I arrived with a severe cold which Dr Wischnewetzky declared to be bron­
chitis.  This got worse, instead of better, and moreover I got a severe indi­
gestion which made me feel on shore the sea sickness I had not had on the 
ocean. Under these circumstances, and with a long journey over unknown 
ground before me, I felt bound to get cured at once and to subordinate 
everything else to this consideration—I therefore placed myself under the 
motherly care of Mrs Sorge, did not leave Hoboken for days together, and 
at last got right again—about the time when we had to leave New York. 
Had it not been for this, I should certainly have come to pass a day with 
you; as it was, I had to choose between perfect rest at Hoboken, and an 
excursion which was almost sure to have upset me for the whole of the 
journey and maybe laid me up somewhere far out in the country. 
The 500 copies3 from Lee and Shepard have arrived—but too late to 
be sent out before the Christmas holidays, when nothing but holiday 
literature is noticed—I have therefore kept them back until now. On 
Monday the copies to the press will go out and the rest be handed to 
Reeves. As the boycott of the London Socialists against Marx and myself 
(exactly like that of English prehistoric old fogies against Morgan)350 
seems still in force, I am curious what the effect will be. 
With best wishes for the New Year. 
Yours faithfully 
F. Engels

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 14 January 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
Reply from Liebknecht and Bebel after mutual consultation. 351 It 
would appear that they never had any intention of going to the 
Possibilist congress direct and without reference to you. But 
1) Since the London congress320 resolved to convene a congress in Paris 
and entrusted its organisation to the Possibilists, the latter do have certain 
rights,  notably in regard to the nationalities represented in London who 
concurred with that resolution. (Why, by the bye, have you abdicated so 
completely and abandoned the field to the Possibilists?) 
2) The Dutch have expressly asked that the Possibilists be invited to 
the congress, making this a condition for their (the Dutchmen's) atten­
dance. 
3) And Liebknecht is right when he says that the Germans cannot 
expose themselves to attack by French workers in Paris—a hazard, he 
avers,  against which you have been unable to give them any sort of guar­
antee. 
Apparently, then, it has been resolved to convene a preliminary 
conference at Nancy,352 one delegate per foreign nationality, and one 
delegate from each of the three French parties—yourselves, Blanquists, 
Possibilists; also to move that, at the congress, the right to speak be with­
drawn from any speaker alluding to the internal affairs of those three 
parties and to the differences between them. In this way there would be 
only one congress, at which everyone would be represented. 
I don't see how you can turn this down. If it then be seen that you are 
prepared to act along with everyone else, and that the Possibilists are 
trying to exclude you, it would be enough to put the Possibilists in the 
wrong, even in the eyes of the Dutch and Belgians (the Flemings are all 
right but, where their foreign policy is concerned, they are under the 
thumb of those false brethren in Brussels of whom you know); if, on the 
other hand, they accept, you will only have yourselves to blame should 
you fail to prove to one and all that it is you, and not they, who repre­
sent French Socialism.

256 Letters -1889 
Here is the text of what Liebknecht says: 
'Ich richtete also am Dienstag 8. Januar nach Besprechung mit Bebel 
eine formelle Einladung an das Blatt a (der Possibilisten).b  Kommt kein 
Delegierter derselben (zur Konferenz) so haben wir freie Hand. Kommt 
einer oder kommen mehrere, so werden wir schon mit ihnen fertig 
werden. Fügen sie sich, dann gut. Fügen sie sich nicht, dann sind sie 
isoliert und werden von uns tot gemacht' ... 'In jedem Fall sichert die 
Konferenz das Gelingen des Kongresses und die Lahmlegung der 
Broussisten.' c 
If all this is correct, I cannot see that you have cause for complaint; on 
the contrary, it would provide an excellent opportunity to force the hand 
of the Possibilists. Before answering, however, I am anxious to ascertain 
the facts and to hear what you have to say. After consulting your friends, 
therefore, and after seeking the advice of the Blanquists, do write and tell 
me what you think about all this; and do it soon, it's urgent. 
Give Laura a kiss from Nim and from  myself. 
Yours ever,

The proposed discussion with Tussy and Edward3 cannot take place as 
they are both in Cornwall and don't intend to return until next week or 
later. Meanwhile Tussy has already written to tell your wife what she could 
about the case in point. But however that may be, we've got to get you both 
back here and no doubt this can be done somehow or other by the spring. 
Now I must return to my mss.,a which I have had to neglect for the past 
month—on account of the fog and all manner of correspondences to do 
with the rumpuses in Paris and London. Warm regards to Louise

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 211

London, 28 January 1889 
Dear Kautsky, 
Today I have a proposal to make to you which has Ede's, Gina'sb and 
Tussy's blessing.

continue to spare my eyes for a very long time if they are to get right again.

And that rules out the possibility, at least for several years to come, of 
anyone taking down the ms. of Book IV of CapitaP5i at my own dictation. 
On the other hand, I must see to it that not only this but Marx's other 
mss. remain usable even in my absence. There is no way of my doing so 
other than by giving coaching in these hieroglyphics to people who can, 
if necessary, take my place and in any case help me with the editing in 
the meantime. And for this purpose you and Ede are the only ones I can 
employ. So for the time being I propose that that is what the three of us 
should do. 
But then the first thing to be tackled is Book IV, and Ede is too preoc­
cupied with the editing of the Sozialdemokrat and with the many hold­
ups and intrigues that are part and parcel of the shop here. But I imagine 
that, after a bit of coaching and practice and with the help of your wife, a 
you would in the course of, say, two years, find sufficient time to turn 
the 750 pages or so of the original (a good part of which will probably 
be dropped as having been included in Book IIIb) into a legible ms. Once 
you were able to read the writing fairly well, you could dictate to your 
wife and then things would go faster. 
Now I have worked it out as follows: if, as hitherto, I could dictate to 
Eisengarten for 5 hours a day, that would take me a year—allowing for 
interruptions. In return I would have to pay Eisengarten £2 a week— 
£100.  So that is what it would cost me in any event and, if you are 
prepared to take the work on for that amount, that is what I shall pay. 
Spread over two years it would mean a payment of £50 each year; should 
the work go ahead faster, payment would be forthcoming sooner. We 
here are of the opinion that in these circumstances you might perhaps 
have no objection to returning. I would suggest that I pay you in quar­
terly advances of £12.10, for progress would be slow at first and faster 
later on, and hence there would be no sense in proposing that payments 
should be related from the outset to the quantity of work done. 
Ede simply cannot wait to be initiated in the hieroglyphics. I have in 
fact some other mss. for him and shall likewise give him coaching, but I 
told him, of course, that I could only pay one of you and this he readily 
accepted. 
What I have in mind here is the ultimate publication at some later 
date—though perhaps this won't be possible during my life time—of 
collected editions of things by Marx and  myself,  and it is in regard to this

particular matter that I would now like to make the necessary provi­
sions.  I have also mentioned it to Tussy and we can expect all possible 
help from that quarter. Once I have got you both to the stage of reading 
Marx's handwriting well, a heavy load will have been lifted from my 
shoulders and I shall then be able to spare my eyes without neglecting an 
important duty, for by that time there will be two people, at any rate, to 
whom the mss. are no longer a book with seven seals. 
Apart from Lenchen, only Ede and Aveling and their wives know of 
my plan and, if you are in agreement, no one save the two of you need 
know anything about the details of the affair. It might also provide 
Louise with a congenial occupation. 
So give the matter some thought and, if you agree to it, come over as 
soon as you can. You'll be able to secure Schlüter's furniture at little cost 
and at the same time attractive, if temporary, lodgings. Louise will 
doubtless want to get her course and exams 354 over first, but how that 
can be arranged is something of which the two of you are better judges 
than we over here. 
Boulanger's election344 is bringing the situation in France to a head. The 
Radicals, in their haste to come to power, have made themselves the 
servants of opportunism and corruption and by doing so have virtually 
become a breeding ground for Boulangism.137  But it bodes ill for Paris that 
in its rage at these goings-on it has cast itself into the arms of a barely 
disguised Bonapartism. For the present, the only conclusion I can draw 
from all this is that Paris is renouncing its traditional revolutionary 
mission. Fortunately the provinces are better. The worst of it is that the 
danger of war looms ever larger and that Bismarck can now have a war 
whenever he wants one. He only needs to provoke another Schnaebelé-
type incident"—which Boulanger won't be able to swallow as Ferry did. 
Best wishes to Louise from Nim and myself, 
Your 
F. E. 
Give my regards to those trusty friends who sent me their New Year's 
greetings, in particular Frankel. You all seem to be going strong again

So it's well that another speculative bailleur de fonds* has turned up. That 
our people can make a paper a success they have proved at the Citoyen 
and the Cri where in both cases other intruders tried to make capital out 
of our people's success and came to  grief.  And the composition of the 
comité is in their favour, the Blanquists secure them the majority on 
economic questions, and the Hovelacque elements will help holding 
Blanquist madcap notions in check. But how long will these various 
elements hold together? Anyhow, let us wait till everything is shipshape. 
The Boulanger election 344 I cannot look upon otherwise than as a 
distinct revival of the Bonapartist element in the Parisian character. In 
1798,  1848 and 1889 this revival arose equally from discontent with the 
bourgeois republic, but it took this especial direction—appeal to a 
saviour of society—entirely in consequence of a chauvinistic current. 
And what is worse: in 1798 Napoleon had to make a coup d'état to 
conquer those Parisians he had shot down in Vendémiaire; 356 in 1889 the 
Parisians themselves elect a butcher of the Commune. To put it mildly, 
Paris has, at least temporarily, abdicated as a revolutionary city; abdi­
cated, not before a victorious coup d'état and in the midst of war, as in 
1798;  not six months after a crushing defeat, as in December 1848; but in 
the midst of peace, 18 years after the Commune, and on the eve of a 
probable revolution. And when Bebel says in the Vienna Gleichheit: 
'Die Pariser Arbeiter haben sich in ihrer Mehrheit einfach erbärmlich 
benommen — mitt ihrer sozialistischen und klassenbewussten 
Gesinnung muss es sehr traurig stehn, wenn nur 17,000 Stimmen auf 
einen sozialistischen Kandidaten fallen und ein Hanswurst und dema­
gog wie Boulanger 244,000 Stimmen erhält' b357 
— Nobody can say that he is wrong. The effect upon our party every­
where has been that if Floquet has suffered a crushing defeat, so have we. 
Cutting off your nose to spite your face is no doubt also a sort of policy, 
but what sort? 
Well, Boulanger is now sure to be master of France unless he commits 
some egregious blunder, and the Parisians will have their bellyful of him. 
If the thing goes off without war being brought on, it will be something 
gained—but the danger is great. Bismarck has every reason to hurry on 
a investor (Jules Roques) - b 'The majority of Paris workers behaved downright 
despicably  - their socialist and class consciousness must be in  a sorry state indeed 
if a socialist candidate only gets 17,000 votes and a clown and demagogue like 
Boulanger polls 244,000 votes.'

a row, because William3  is doing his best to ruin the German army by 
putting his favourites in the places of the old generals, and if he is 
allowed to proceed, in five years hence the Germans will be led by noth­
ing but nincompoops and conceited jackasses. And how Boulanger, once 
in power, can outlive the effects of the universal désillusionnement which 
he must produce, without going to a war—that is more than I can see. 
In all this mess it is but a poor consolation that the Possibilists have 
ruined themselves a little sooner than they would have done otherwise. 
But such as it is, let us rejoice over it. I send you two Recht voor Allen 
in which you see how they are getting treated by the very mass who 
insisted on their presence at the Congress. 358 Bernstein has given it them 
this week in the Sozialdemokrat^ too, and even Hyndman has not the 
courage to stick up for them in Justice. To take his revenge, he writes a 
letter to Bax (5 Canning Road, Croydon) and asks him what it was that 
he, Bax, said about this point at the office of the Sozialdemokrat and 
what was repeated to me yesterday by Joos (one of the men there). I 
should be the more glad of this, as Bax was here yesterday too and never 
mentioned a word to me about it—it came out only after he had left. He 
can tell Bax that I told him so. 
Well, I hope the new paper0  will come out; we must take the situation 
as it is and make the best of it. When Paul gets to work at a paper again, 
he will brace himself up for the fight and no longer say despondingly: il 
n'y a pas à aller contre le courante Nobody asks of him to stop the 
current, but if we are not to go against the popular current of momen­
tary tomfoolery, what in the name of the devil is our business? The 
inhabitants of the Ville lumière^ have proved to evidence that they are 2 
million 'mostly fools' as Carlyle says, but that is no reason why we 
should be fools too. Let the Parisians turn reactionists if they cannot be 
happy otherwise—the social revolution will go on in spite of them, and 
when it's done they can cry out: Ah tiens!  C'est  fait— et sans nous —qui

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 11 February 1889 
My dear Laura, 
Well this Egalité anyhow is quite a relief after the dear dull deadly 
Cri du Peuple {ennuyeux*). The last few numbers of that defunct paper 
were really crushing. Poor Vaillant who can write a very good article 
when a critical point has been reached, but who is the last man in the 
world to spin out yarns by the yard day after day—you actually saw him 
perspire over his daily task, and it was a desponding sight. The involu­
tions,  evolutions and circumvolutions of Longuet in his attempts to set 
himself right (and at the same time wrong) with his Radical ex-friends 
are at least amusing, and artistically done. 359 Paul's [article on] night-
work is really good; though he might have tapé un peu plus dur 0 on 
Boulanger. Today I had no Egalité —perhaps the snow has delayed it. We 
are six inches deep in it here. 
I read your admonition yesterday to Tussy and she pleads guilty. 
How far she will mind is beyond my cognizance. 
Nim was rather out of sorts last week, some sort of derangement of 
the bowels, but is all right now. 
Of Capital, III, vol. I finished section IV yesterday—about 1/3 of the 
whole cubic foot of ms. 
In the Dispatch I send you please note A. Smith on page 2C —full of 
lies as usual—but it shows what the Possibilists are after. That the 
Germans are going to their congress is a barefaced lie, and that the 
Danes, Dutch etc. are, is probably another. Bax told Tussy that 
Hyndman had sounded him as to what the Germans intended doing in 
this respect, and Bax asked him: are you then the representative of the 
Possibilists in London? to which Hyndman said he was and in that 
capacity wanted the information. Whereupon Bax said: then you better 
write me a letter which I can submit to Engels and Bernstein. There the 
matter rests at present. But you see how busy they are.

ENGELS TO JOHN LINCOLN MAHON 130 
IN LONDON 
[London],  14 February 1889 
As far as I know G. J. Harney is still in England. Will let you know posi­
tively as soon as I can, will try to write to him and ascertain his where­
abouts at once. If I can be of any use to Mr. Atherley Jones, 361 shall be 
glad to see him, am at home almost every evening. 
Have not yet had the time to study your programme131 sufficiently to 
give an opinion. I am very much debarred from reading by gas by 
medical orders. 
Yours truly

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 362 
IN VIENNA 
London, 20 February 1889 
Dear Kautsky, 
I return herewith the Neue Zeit articles* with brief marginal notes. 
The chief defect lies in the want of good material—Taine and 
Tocqueville, those idols of the philistines, are inadequate here. b Had you 
been working over here, you would have found material of quite a 
different order—better secondary and masses of primary sources. Quite 
apart from the fact that the best book on the peasants, by Kareyev, is in 
Russian. But if, over there, you can get hold of: 
Moreau de Jounès, Etat économique et social de la France depuis 
Henri IV jusqu'à Louis XIV, Paris 1867, you could profitably read the 
same. 
Section II, p. 3. Here you could do with a clear exposé showing 
how absolute monarchy comes into being as a natural compromise 
between aristocracy and bourgeoisie and hence must protect the inter­
ests of, and share out favours to, either side. To the—politically super­
annuated—aristocracy falls the share of plundering the peasants and 
the Exchequer, and of exercising indirect political influence through 
the Court, the army, the Church and the upper reaches of the admin­
istration; to the bourgeoisie, protection by means of tariffs and 
monopolies, and a relatively well-organised administration and judi­
ciary. If you make that your starting-point, much will be elucidated 
and simplified. 
This paragraph also omits all mention of the judicial aristocracy

Gedenkfeier der grosen Revolution', Die Neue Zeit,  7. Jhg, 1889, Hefte 1-4 - b

{noblesse de robef and of lawyers— la robe —in general who, in fact, also 
constituted a privileged estate and wielded considerable power in the 
parlements where, in their political capacity as the champions of institu­
tions curbing the power of the Crown, they took a stand against the 
latter, i.e. sided with the people but were, in their judicial capacity, the 
very soul of corruption (cf. Mémoires de Beaumarchais^. What you say 
further on about this gang will not suffice. 
III, p. 49. Cf. Note I from Kareyev herewith. 
P. 50 'this species of bourgeois' suddenly becomes 'the' bourgeois par 
excellence, which gives the lie to the dichotomy of the bourgeois class of 
which you are speaking. Altogether you generalise far too much and this 
often makes you absolute where the utmost relativity is called for. 
IV, p. 54. Here there ought to be some mention of how it was that 
these plebeians, who were outside the system of estates and thus more or 
less disenfranchised or outlawed, arrived in the course of the revolution 
only by degrees at what you call 'Sansculottism' (yet another ism!); like­
wise some mention of the role they played. That would get you over the 
difficulties on p. 53, which you seek to cope with by means of casual 
references and veiled allusions to new modes of production. Then it 
becomes plain that, here as always, the bourgeois were too cowardly to 
stand up for their own interests, that, from the time of the Bastille 
onwards, all their work had to be done for them by the plebs, that with­
out the latter's intervention on 14 July, 5/6 October, and right up to 10 
August, 2 September, etc., the bourgeoisie would invariably have been 
defeated by the ancien régime and the revolution have been crushed by 
the Coalition in alliance with the Court, and hence that it was those 
plebeians alone who effected the revolution; 363 but that this would not 
have been possible had the said plebeians not put a construction on the 
revolutionary demands of the bourgeoisie which these did not possess, 
had they not pushed equality and fraternity to their furthest logical 
conclusion, thereby standing the bourgeois meaning of those catch­
words completely on its head because, if taken to extremes, that mean­
ing in fact turned into its opposite; that this plebeian equality and frater­
nity must have been sheer moonshine at a time when it was a question 
of producing precisely the opposite and that, as always, this plebeian

construction placed upon the revolutionary catchwords became, by a quirk 
of history, the most powerful lever in effecting that opposite—namely 
bourgeois equality—before the law—and fraternity—in exploitation. 
I would say a great deal less about the modern mode of production. 
In every case a yawning gap divides it from the facts you adduce and, 
thus out of context, it appears as a pure abstraction which, far from 
throwing light on the subject, renders it still more obscure. 
As regards the Terror, it was essentially a military measure, so long as 
it had any point. It enabled the class or faction of the class group which 
alone could secure the victory of the revolution, not only to remain at 
the helm (the least of their problems once the rebellions had been 
subdued), but also to ensure that they had freedom of movement, elbow-
room,  and could concentrate their forces at the crucial point, the frontier. 
By the end of 1793 this last had been pretty well secured; 1794 began 
well, with the French armies advancing almost everywhere. The 
Commune364  with its extremist tendencies became redundant, its pro-
revolutionary propagandism became an embarrassment to Robespierre 
no less than to Danton, both of whom—if each after his own fashion— 
wanted peace. In this conflict of three elements Robespierre was the 
victor, but now the Terror became for him a means of self-preservation 
and therefore absurd: when, at Fleurus on the 26th of  June,  Jourdan laid 
the whole of Belgium at the Republic's feet, 365 it became unwarrantable; 
on 27 July Robespierre fell and the bourgeois orgy began. 
'Prosperity for all based on labour' is far too definite a way of 
expressing the aspirations of the plebeian 'fraternité' of those days. What 
they wanted no one could say until, long after the fall of the Commune, 
Babeuf gave it definite form. 366 If the Commune with its aspirations to 
fraternity came too soon, Babeuf for his part came too late.

Note I. Fourth Estate 
The conception of a Fourth Estate, alongside I, II and III, arose very 
early in the Revolution. Dufaurny de Villiers' Cahiers du 4 e ordre, celui 
des pauvres journaliers, des infirmes, des indigents, etc., l'ordre des infor­
tunés —25 avril 1789 appeared at the very start. But as a rule the Fourth 
Estate was regarded as consisting of peasants. E.g. Noilliac, Le plus fort 
des pamphlets. L'ordre des paysans aux États-généraux. 26 février 1789, 
p. 9: 'Prenons de la constitution suédoise les quartre ordres.'* —Vartout, 
Lettre d'un paysan à son curé, sur une nouvelle manière de tenir les 
États-généraux, Sartrouville, 1789, p. 7: 'J'avons entendu dire que dans 
un pays qui est au Nord ...on admettait aux États assemblés l'ordre des 
paysans. * 
A few other versions of the Fourth Estate also occur; one pamphlet 
suggests a Fourth Estate of merchants, another, of magistrates, etc. 
According to Kareyev, The Peasants and the Peasant Question in 
France in the Last Quarter of the 18th Century, Moscow, 1879, p. 327. 
Note II. Beggars

means beggar) was highest in the provinces which were considered the

most fertile; this was due to the fact that there were very few landown­
ing peasants in these areas. 
'But let the figures speak. In Argentré (Brittany), out of the 2,300 
inhabitants not living by industry or trade, more than half can barely 
make ends meet, and over 500 people have been reduced to destitution. 
In Dainville (Artois), 60 families out of 130 are impoverished. 
Normandy: in Saint-Patrice 400 out of the 1,500 inhabitants, and in 
Saint-Laurent three-quarters out of the 500 live on alms (Taine). From 
the Cahiers 369 of the Douai bailliage we learn that in one village 
(Bouvignies parish) half of the 332 families live on alms, in another (Aix 
parish) 65 families out of the 143 are impoverished, in a third (Landus 
parish) about one hundred out of the 413 are destitute, and so on and so 
forth. In the Puy-en-Velay sénéchaussée, according to the Cahiers of the 
local clergy, 58,897 of the 120,000 inhabitants are not in a position to 
pay any taxes at all (Archives Parlementaires de 1787 à 1860, Vol. V, p. 
467).  In the villages of the Carhaix arrondissement the position was as 
follows: Frerogan: 10 well-to-do families (dostatochnyi, possessing 
enough), 10 poor, and 10 destitute.  Motref:  47 well-to-do families, 74 
less prosperous ones, 64 poor ones and families of day labourers. Paule: 
200 households, most of which fully deserve the description of beggars' 
homes (Archives Nationales B A, IV, 17). The Cahier of the Marboeuf 
parish states that out of the 500 inhabitants nearly 100 are destitute 
(Boivin-Champeaux, Notice historique sur la Révolution dans le 
département de l'Eure, 1872, p. 83). The peasants of Harville village say 
as many as one-third of them live in poverty for lack of employment 
('Requête des habitants de la Commune d'Harville', Archives 
Nationales). 
'In the cities the position was no better. In Lyons 30,000 workmen 
were destitute in 1787. Paris, with a population of 650,000 had 118,784 
indigents (Taine I, [p.] 507). In Rennes 1/3 of the inhabitants lived on 
alms and another 1/3 were in constant danger of destitution 
(Duchatellier, L'agriculture en Bretagne, Paris, 1863, p. 178). The 
Jurassian town of Lons-le-Saunier was so poor that, when the 
Constituante 370 introduced the electoral qualification, only 728 of the 
6,518 inhabitants were qualified as eligible to vote (Sommier, Histoire de 
la révolution dans le Jura, Paris, 1846, p. 33). Small wonder, therefore, 
that during the revolution those living on charity were counted by the 
million. For instance, a church pamphlet published in 1791 says there 
were 6 million paupers (indigents) in France (Avis aux Pauvres sur la rév 
olution présente et sur  les biens du clergé, p.  15). This is doubtless a some-

what exaggerated estimate, but that given for the year 1774—1,200,000 
paupers—perhaps does not fall below the actual figure (Duval, Cahiers

Dear Sorge, 
Your postcard of 19 January and letter of 10 February received.372 I 
take The Labor Standard and shall give Mrs Wischnewetzky's articles to 
Tussy, who will use them, should the 'Labor Movement' happen to be 
re-issued. The stuff in them is typical of America. Neglect of fire precau­
tions,  etc., on that scale simply would not pay in Europe. But it's the 
same attitude as you take to railroads and everything else; provided only 
that they exist, no matter how, that is sufficient. 
Thank you for the item on Appleton. 373 On being approached,

I shall write and tell Kautsky what you have said about Rappaport.375 
Lack of material and a desire to be versatile mean that many get in who 
have no business to be there. Kautsky has been in Vienna since July and 
won't be returning here before July. 
I have sent you The Holy Family by registered book packet along 
with some French  stuff.  But you mustn't tell Schlüter that I sent it to you; 
I had more or less promised him my spare copy for the archives 227 before 
my trip to America, but you come first. It will probably arrive in March 
or April. 
In addition to this—all of them by today's post—there's a further 
parcel of French stuff as well as Commonweal and Gleichheit. Lafargue's 
and Deville's lectures 376 are no longer to be had here and I can't get a 
reply out of the authors. However I keep pegging away at them. 
You will have received the copies of the Egalité. The Blanquists have 
had no luck with their Cri du Peuple; having bored people to tears, they 
found themselves compelled to join forces with Guesde, Lafargue, etc. 
(which Vaillant wanted to do from the beginning but was outvoted). In 
addition there are a few discontented Radicals. Up till now they have all 
got on well together—let's hope it will remain so. Some more copies will 
go off shortly. 
During the latest election in Paris the Possibilists thoroughly 
disgraced themselves and actively supported the Opportunist Jacques.344 
The workers are now beginning to desert them. In the provinces, which 
are far better than Paris, they have lost all support. Their attempt, with 
the help of the English Trades Unions and of Hyndman, their trusty ally 
over here, to arrange an international congress in Paris without our 
Frenchmen but with the Belgians, Danes, Dutch and hence, or so they 
hoped, the Germans as well, is proving an ignominious failure. The 
Germans say they will not attend either congress if 2 of them are held in 
Paris.  And both parties have been summoned to a conference at The 
Hague on the 28th of this month360 ; of the Germans, Liebknecht, Bebel 
and Bernstein will be there, and so will the Dutch and Belgians. Lafargue 
is going. So they must either eat humble pie or face universal opposition. 
In Germany things are getting more and more confused. Now that 
old William3 is dead and Bismarck is tottering, the philistines have lost 
all confidence in the wielders of power. That vain young fool,b the new,

Chancellor in one; the arch-reactionaries, priests and Junkers at court are 
doing their utmost to incite him against Bismarck and to bring about a 
clash—and meanwhile little Willie is pensioning off all the old generals 
and replacing them with his favourites. Another three years and the 
commands will all be in the hands of impudent coxcombs and the army 
will be ripe for another Jena.377  Bismarck knows this and that is what 
might induce him to embark on a quick war, especially if that vagabond 
Boulanger gets to the top. And then we'll have a pretty state of affairs: 
an alliance between France and Russia which will completely rule out 
any revolution in France, for otherwise Russia will turn against her. But 
I hope it blows over.

My dear Lafargue, 
The Possibilists have behaved just as they should—both as regards 
themselves and as regards  us. 378 I was afraid they would accept—with 
reservations which, though apparently insignificant, would have been 
enough to bedevil the whole issue. Fortunately they appear to be too

much committed to the course already embarked upon—the financial 
exploitation of their position on the Municipal Council. This time they 
have dealt themselves the coup de grâce. 
As for the Municipal Council's 50,000 frs, they will probably get 
them, you cannot prevent it. Let them use the money for their 
congress—what does it matter? Not all the money in the coffers of the 
Municipal Council of Paris would suffice to manufacture a socialist 
congress, except as a joke.379 
The Germans have made concessions enough and are unlikely to 
make any more. The Dutch have been subjected to direct attack by the 
Possibilists, the Swiss and the Danes are following the German lead and 
the Belgians are divided, for while the Brussels people are, as you say, 
Possibilists at heart, the Flemings are very much better, and all that is 
wanted is to extricate them from the Brussels sphere of influence. Up till 
now they have left their foreign policy entirely in the hands of the 
Brussels people, but this time we may well see a change. 
It is a great misfortune that you should be without a paper at this vital 
juncture. M. Roques is an idiot and is simply throwing his money down 
the drain. The present editors will cost him ten times the 35 frs a day on 
account of which he has let go the only editors who might have made a 
success of his paper. 380 But that does not alter the fact that this business 
has happened at the most inopportune moment. 
If you have invited the League21 to the conference without also invit­
ing the Federation,62 as I can only conclude from your letter,a it was a 
mistake on your part. Either both should have been invited, or both 
should have been left out. In the first place, the Federation is indubitably 
more important than the League and, in the second, it gives them an 
excuse to say that the whole conference has been arranged without their 
knowledge. Hyndman, face to face with all of you, couldn't have done 
the least harm—quite the contrary and, although he claims to represent 
the Possibilists over here in matters connected with the congress, he has 
not dared of late to stand up for them in his paper,b  but rather has rapped 
them over the knuckles, if very gently. And Bernstein, who is aware of all 
this, would have kept him within decent limits. However, it was the 
Germans who were to convene the conference and, as always, Liebknecht 
acted—or refrained from action—in response to some passing whim.

Dear Dr Schmidt, 
You must excuse me for being unable to reply to your note of the 5th 
inst. Until today. I have had a family over here from Germany on a visit 
and there hasn't been a moment to spare. 
So your academic adventures have been followed by adventures with 
the press.382 It's just like it was between 1842 and 1845383 and you'll now 
have some idea of how we fared then. However, we have made a bit of 
progress since that time and the tricks played by the world of official­
dom today, even though they may be quite as beastly as they were then, 
are no longer so far-reaching.

know that he usually rejects pamphlets on principle and it wouldn't 
surprise me if that is the reason he will give. 
However, I have yet another suggestion: You should write and ask 
Karl Kautsky, whom you know, of course, from the time you were both 
over here— Igelgasse 13/I, Vienna IV—whether he cannot arrange for 
Dietz in Stuttgart to take the piece. Or again to Dr H. Braun, Munich, 
to see whether he can suggest a publisher. 
If you would like me to send you an introduction to Bebel, Liebknecht 
or Singer while the Reichstag is in session, you are very welcome to one. 
If the thing isn't too long, Kautsky might possibly take it for the Neue 
Zeit.™ 4 
So you too live in the Dorotheenstrasse—I myself lived there in 
1841191  on the south side, a bit to the east of the Friedrichstrasse —it will 
all have changed a great deal by now. 
I was also glad to get your note of 18 January. I trust the plan you 
outlined in it to live by your pen will come off. Obviously you will first 
have to learn the ropes to some extent in this new world and if the 
gentlemen of the press are of the same breed over there as they are here, 
you can hardly fail to make a number of unavoidable, if somewhat unde­
sirable, acquaintanceships. 
I have taken a look at the Sweating Committee report3—there are two 
fat folio volumes (containing the witnesses' statements) and hardly 
believe you will feel impelled to work your way through them. 
However, if you want to take a preliminary look at them, you will find 
them in the Reichstag library; one or other of the deputies could get hold 
of them for you, and if you then felt inclined to go into the matter more 
thoroughly, I should be happy to send them to you. 
Meanwhile my sincere regards combined with the request that you 
send me further news of yourself from time to time.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
[London],  21 March 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
You and Bebel are both right and the thing is quite simple. 
It was resolved at The Hague385 that, should the Possibilists not 
accept the conditions laid down, the Belgians and Swiss would together 
take steps to convene a congress in Paris, and that a joint declaration 
would be made against the Possibilists; the congress would be held by 
the end of September. 
This was resolved—if you were absent—in the presence of Bonnier, 
who was your interpreter from the German and who should know. The 
Belgians gave their express consent. 
Now, if the Belgians and Swiss take the initiative, it will be your 
organisation to which the organisation and all the preparations will be 
entrusted, which means that you will be getting everything you have 
asked for, so do be a little patient. 
If your groups prove to be as unreasonable as the Possibilists, it will 
be their own fault if the whole thing ends up in victory for the latter. 
It's a matter of making the Possibilist congress a failure, of which 
there are good prospects, provided you don't spoil everything by your 
impatience. 
The Possibilists have put themselves in the wrong in the eyes of all 
the world. Now, mind you don't go and do the same yourselves by 
appearing to want to lay down the law for the Socialists of other 
nations. 
Either the Belgians must comply or they too will put themselves in 
the wrong—I would beg you not to provide them with a plausible 
excuse for extricating themselves from their quandary. Even if the 
Belgians cannot comply, all will not yet be lost, not in my opinion, at 
any rate. Always providing you don't spike your own guns by undue 
precipitation. 
That you will not be able to hold your congress on  14 July is beyond 
doubt, unless you choose to hold it in isolation. I am not arguing about

which date is or is not suitable but, since the matter appears to have been 
decided at The Hague, there's no changing it, do what you will. 
In negotiations one cannot always get one's own way. The Germans 
for their part have had to concede quite a number of points in order to 
ensure common action. So accept what is offered you which, in fact, is 
all you are entitled to ask and which, provided you don't put a foot 
wrong, will result in international exclusion of the Possibilists and 
recognition of yourselves as the only French Socialists with whom 
contact should be maintained. 
It was a mistake that you should not have been officially presented with 
a copy of the relevant resolution taken at The Hague. But, as you are 
aware, it is not the first case of carelessness at an international conference. 
Yours ever, 
F. E. 
Herewith a copy of Justice. 
We are preparing a reply in which Possibilists' intrigues386 will be 
unmasked to the English. So, as you can see, we are doing everything we 
possibly can but, if you are as obstinate as the Possibilists, it will be all 
to no avail.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 23 March 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
There is no denying that agreement was reached at The Hague385 that, 
should the Possibilists fail to comply, the Belgians and the Swiss, the two 
neutral nations, should convene the congress; that a joint declaration 

=====第291页=====
280 letters-1889 
against the Possibilists be  issued;  and that the congress be convened in 
Paris for the end of September. 
According to what Bernstein tells me, he told you as much, besides 
which, it seems impossible that something so important could have 
happened without your knowing anything at all about it. And Bonnier, 
so Bernstein tells me, was present—even if you were not. 
Well, now, if things are to be taken to a successful conclusion, it is 
absolutely essential that everyone abides by what has been resolved. 
You can perfectly well leave the initiative of the convocation to the 
Belgians and Swiss; an international congress can perfectly well meet 
without its having been convened by the Socialists of the locality where 
it is to be held. What is certain is that the real business—organisation and 
preparation—will be in your hands, and this must suffice you. If you ask 
anything more, you will not have a congress at all and the Possibilists 
will emerge victorious from the fray. Before the eyes of all Europe they 
will hold their own congress, which will then be the only international 
working men's congress of the year. 
If the matter were still open to discussion, I myself would be 
inclined to share your view that the congress should be held alongside 
that of the Possibilists, even at the risk of a fight with them. But it was 
thought fit to hold it in September and resolved accordingly. There 
is no going back on that and, should you insist, you will hold a 
congress all on your own, to the glee of Europe and the delight of the 
Possibilists. 
On the other hand, I have written to Bebel telling him he has no right 
to present you with an ultimatum or to say: if the Belgians go back on 
their word, we shall be free and will not attend the congress. Also that 
they, the Germans, are too deeply committed to pull out in such a way, 
and that a Belgian withdrawal, should it take place—and this we cannot 
tell—would not relieve the others of their mutual obligations. Bebel is a 
man of great common sense and I have every reason to believe that he 
will think better of it, provided you do not raise fresh objections and 
attempt to go back on the resolutions taken once and for all at The 
Hague. 
Things are going admirably and you are the only people who can put 
a spoke in the wheel. 
But even supposing the Belgians were to withdraw—in that event 
the Swiss would convene the congress on their own and, as they 
would be acting on behalf of the other nationalities, success would be 
assured. 

=====第292页=====
Letters-1889 281 
But there is only one way in which the Belgians can be relieved of 
their responsibility or given a pretext for breaking faith and that is for 
you, the French, to act in contravention of the Hague resolutions and to 
be the first to do so. If you abide by them, I am pretty sure the Belgians 
will also assent, in which case the Possibilists will be isolated, which is, 
after all, the main objective to be kept in view. 
Our reply to the attacks in Justice3*6  (essential, now that the 
Sozialdemokrat has set up in London) has appeared and, at the same 
time as this, but by book post, I am sending you six copies, of which 1 
each for Laura, Longuet and Vaillant. On Monday the thing is going to 
be disseminated throughout London, handed out at all socialist meet­
ings,  and despatched into the provinces. It will, I hope, give the 
Possibilist gentry and Mr Hyndman something to think about. 
You have doubtless seen the attack injustice, which I believe I enclose 
in my last letter.3 
Now, let me repeat: Be reasonable, carry out faithfully what has been 
resolved, do not make it impossible for your best friends to lend you 
their support, give and take, use the position gained at The Hague for 
your point of departure, as the first position wrested from the enemy 
and as a base for future victories. But do not force down the throat of the 
other nationalities things which they certainly will not swallow. The 
battle's as good as won, I tell you, and if you were to lose it now, you 
and you only would be to blame. 
Yours ever, 
F. E.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 387 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 25 March 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
You speak of a congress in August, although you know that the 
conference385 resolved to hold it at the end of September. I repeat: If you 
deviate by so much as a fraction of an inch from what was agreed to by 
everyone at The Hague, you will provide the Belgians with a pretext for 
withdrawing, and then, as Bebel has told you, everything will be jeopar­
dised. I am quite willing to urge the Germans to put pressure on the 
Belgians, but I shall do nothing until I know for certain that you, the 
French, like everyone else, unreservedly assent to the resolutions taken 
at the conference. Otherwise people will tell me, and with reason: How 
can you ask us to commit ourselves for the sake of people who do not 
respect their own commitments? 
Either, then, you hold a congress as resolved at The Hague, or you 
do not hold one at all. And only on the day when I am given the assur­
ance that you Parisians whole-heartedly and unreservedly assent to the 
resolutions that have been taken, only then shall I feel able to act, and 
shall act. 
It is not a question of deciding which would be better, August or 
September—that question has already been decided and to raise it again 
would be to play into the Possibilists' hands. 
As for Boulanger, I myself feel pretty sure that you will have to put 
up with him and that that idiot Rochefort, if he doesn't become a 
complete scoundrel, may, as a reward for his services, find himself once 
again in Caledonia. 388 Every now and again the French go through a 
Bonapartist phase, and the current one is even more shameful than the 
last. They will pay for the consequences of their own actions—that is 
the law of history—and the day of reckoning will probably be the 
centenary of their great revolution.—That is the irony of history. What 
a fine spectacle it will present to the world at large—France celebrating 
her revolutionary jubilee by paying homage to an adventurer such as 
this. 
Doubtless he will bleed the big financiers, if only to pay the debts 

=====第294页=====
Letters- 1889 283 
incurred during his dictatorial campaign and to reward his gang. And the 
money from the big financiers will not be enough. As Marx said of 
Boustrapa,260 he would have to rob France of all her money in order to 
use that money to bribe the whole of France." And as for you, he will 
crush you. 
As for war, that is, to my mind, the most terrible of eventualities. 
Otherwise I shouldn't give a fig for the whims of Mme la France. But a 
war in which there will be 10 to 15 million combatants, unparalleled 
devastation simply to keep them fed, universal and forcible suppression 
of our movement, a recrudescence of chauvinism in all countries and, 
ultimately, enfeeblement ten times worse than after 1815, a period of 
reaction based on the inanition of all the peoples by then bled white— 
and, withal, only a slender hope that that bitter war may result in revo­
lution—it fills me with horror. Especially when I think of our move­
ment in Germany, which would be overwhelmed, crushed, brutally 
stamped out of existence, whereas peace would almost certainly bring 
us victory. 
Nor, during such a war, would France be able to have a revolution for 
fear of impelling her only ally, Russia, into the arms of Bismarck and 
finding herself crushed by a coalition. The slightest revolutionary move 
would be a betrayal of one's country. 
How the Russian diplomats would laugh!

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 27 March 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
You know what Hegel says: Anything that is spoiled is spoiled for the 
best possible reasons.3 And your Parisians are going to the greatest pains 
to prove it. 
This is the position: 
After the demise of the Socialiste 91 your Party disappeared from the 
international scene. You had abdicated, you were dead so far as the other 
Socialist Parties abroad were concerned. It was entirely the fault of your 
workingmen; for they did not choose to read or support one of the best 
papers the Party had ever had. But, after having killed off your medium 
of communication with other Socialists, they must inevitably suffer the 
natural consequences of their behaviour. 
The Possibilists, left in sole possession of the battle field, took advan­
tage of the situation you had yourselves created for them. They had 
friends in Brussels and in London with whose assistance they have 
presented themselves to the world at large as the sole representatives of 
the French Socialists. They have succeeded in enticing the Danes, the 
Dutch and the Flemish to their congress. And you know what trouble 
we have been to in neutralising the victories they have won. 
Now the Germans are offering you an opportunity, not only of re­
entering the stage with éclat, but also of seeing yourselves recognised by 
all the organised parties of Europe as the only French Socialists with 
whom they wish to fraternise. They are offering you an opportunity of 
wiping out at one stroke the effect of all the mistakes you have made, 
and of all the defeats you have suffered, and of rehabilitating yourselves 
in the position to which your theoretical understanding entitles you, but 
which has been compromised by your faulty tactics. They are offering 
you a congress which all the genuine workingmen's parties, even the 
Belgian, will attend, they are offering you a chance of isolating the

Grundrisse.  Theil I. Die Logik.  Werke,  Vol. VI, p.249.

Letters- 1889 285 
Possibilists so that they will have to confine themselves to a bogus 
congress—in other words, they are offering you far more than you had 
a right to expect, having regard to the position you had placed your­
selves in. And then—what do you do? Seize it with both hands? Not a 
bit of it. You behave like spoilt children, you haggle, you ask for more 
and, when you have at last been persuaded to assent to what has been 
agreed by everyone else, you insist on conditions which jeopardise 
everything that has been gained for you. 
So far as you are concerned, what is important is that there should be 
a congress and that it should be in Paris, where you can be acknowledged 
by all to be the only French Socialist Party to have gained international 
recognition; also that the Possibilist congress should, for its part, be a 
bogus congress, notwithstanding the éclat deriving from secret funds and 
the 14th of July. a Everything else is of secondary, indeed less than 
secondary, importance. If you are to be set on your feet again, your 
congress must be held, no matter if it's a flop in the eyes of the bourgeois 
public. In order to regain your position in France, what you need above 
all is international recognition of yourselves and international condem­
nation of the Possibilists, etc. You are offered it—and all you do is sulk! 
As I have already said, I believe your date to be the better one for 
creating an impact in France. But then this should have been explained 
at The Hague.385 You can't blame anyone else if, at the critical moment, 
you went to the next room and everything took place in your absence. 
And I have conscientiously explained your line of reasoning to Bebel, 
asking him to give it his serious consideration. However, I felt impelled 
to add that, in my opinion, the meeting of the congress, on no matter 
what date, must be assured, and that any move that might jeopardise that 
meeting would be a false one. You cannot but be aware that, by re-open­
ing the question of the date, we shall all become embroiled in endless 
discussions and disputes and that we can expect, probably some time 
towards the end of October, to obtain general assent to the date of 14 
July—if,  indeed, in the absence of another conference, which will 
certainly never take place, any new date is agreed at all. 
And then, with typically Parisian naivete, you say: We impatiently 
await the fixing of a date for the international congress! But the date 
had been fixed for the end of September, and it is the same 'we' (who 
'await', etc.)—the same 'we' that want to cancel this date and open a 
a 14 July 1889 was the centenary anniversary of the capture of the Bastille

fresh debate. 'We' will have to wait until the others have familiarised 
themselves with the new proposals of these same 'we', have discussed 
them and have reached an agreement on the matter, if such an agree­
ment is at all possible. 
'We also await protests from the Belgians.' But the Belgians will not 
be the only ones to protest, all are resolved to protest in common. This 
protest would probably already have been lodged, had you not put 
everything in question by demanding a change of date. And as long as 
there is no agreement on this score, nothing will be done. 
So accept what is being offered you, it is, in effect, what matters most: 
victory over the Possibilists. Don't jeopardise the holding of the 
congress. Don't give the Brussels people a pretext for extricating them­
selves from the business, for tergiversating and intriguing, don't upset 
afresh what has already been gained for you. You cannot have all you 
want, but you can have victory. Don't press the Germans, who are doing 
everything for you, to the point where they might despair of the possi­
bility to co-operate with you. Withdraw your demand for a change of 
date,  act like men, not like spoilt children who want to have their cake 
and eat it. Without this, I believe, there will be no congress and the 
Possibilists will jeer at you, and with good reason. 
Yours ever, 
F. E. 
Needless to say, I have written to tell Bebel that you assent to all the 
Hague resolutions, but he will say that, after all this, you are putting 
everything in question again. 
I have not found Bernstein, so shan't be able to send you the 
addresses of the Swiss before yesterday.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 387 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 1 April (St. Bismarck's Day)389 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
If this business of the congress has done nothing else, it has at least 
taught me a capital lesson in patience, a virtue in which I can hardly be 
said to excel. Barely do we succeed in eliminating one difficulty than you 
conjure up another, and wax wroth about nothing at all. I have again 
questioned Bernstein, in whose word I have complete faith, and he has 
again assured me that no resolution of any kind was taken clandestinely 
in your absence. It is ridiculous to suppose that they were trying to hide 
something from you. If you did happen to be absent, Bonnier was there 
and could, besides, understand everything that was said in German. And 
unless I hear anything to the contrary, I must suppose he was sufficiently 
in the know to pass the information on to you; if not, what the devil was 
he doing there? Especially since I have drawn your attention on more 
than one occasion to the fact that Bonnier was, or ought to have been, 
exceptionally well-posted, and you have never replied to, let alone 
contradicted, this. 
And what will be the result of this squabbling with the Germans, 
unless to preclude any sort of congress and to enable Messrs Brousse & 
Co. to flaunt their victory before the eyes of all the world and his wife. 
That the Germans should have no desire to expose themselves to a 
bout of fistcuffs with Possibilists, aided and abetted as these would be by 
the police, nor to have their heads broken, as Prussians and 
Bismarckians, by the Paris riff-raff—valiant as in all big cities when the 
odds are ten to one—I can readily understand. We know from our expe­
rience in Lassallean days how unprofitable hand-to-hand fighting with a 
rival party can be when that party is in alliance with government and 
police390—and that was on our home ground. You certainly cannot hold 
it against them if they hesitate to engage in a similar struggle on ground 
where the mere cry of Prussian, of Bismarck's agent, would be enough 
to rouse against them an ignorant mob, eager to prove its patriotism at 
small cost to  itself.  And although it is my personal belief that the impact 
of the congress would be far greater in July than at any other time, I have 

=====第299页=====
288 Letters -1889 
no right to tell Liebknecht or Bebel that they would not be exposed to 
such risks, were they to fall in with your plan. 
So you can see that in no circumstances is your July congress feasible. 
The more you insist, the less you will get. You have the majority against 
you and, if you wish to co-operate with it, you will have to submit. 
Demand everything and you get nothing, grasp all, lose all. You should 
remember that, though the Germans, the Dutch and the Danes can get 
along very well without a congress, you cannot. For you, the congress is 
essential if you are not to disappear for years from the international 
scene. 
If only you had a tiny little paper, as a token of your existence! The 
most puny party in other countries has its weekly, and you have nothing 
with which to make your presence felt or to keep you in regular touch 
with the rest. For you, it was either a daily or nothing at all. Are you 
going to make the same mistake over the congress?—Either all or noth­
ing? All right, then, it'll be nothing, and no one will ever allude to you 
again and, six months from now, Boulanger will do the rest and snuff 
you out, you and the Possibilists as well. 
To the best of my knowledge, Antoinea never did anything in the 
Reichstag other than protest. From his own point of view he could do 
nothing else. 
The Radicals are mad. It is the height of stupidity to try and destroy 
Boulanger by means of a lawsuit 391 and to suppose that the tide of 
universal suffrage (foolish as this is) will be turned by a political verdict. 
You will get him all the same, the good Boulanger whom you crave, and 
the Socialists will be his first victims. For a First Consul has got to be 
impartial and, for every time he lets the blood of the Stock Exchange, he 
will place another curb on the proletariat, if only to even things out. If it 
weren't for war, this new development would be a prize joke, it would 
soon be over, and then there really would be something to laugh about. 
Yours ever,

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 4 April 1889 
Dear Liebknecht, 
Besides your letters to  myself,  I have before me those to Bonnier and 
Ede. 392 
From them I see that, as usual, we diverge very considerably as soon 
as it comes to taking action. 
Your 'politeness' post festum* would now simply make you look 
ridiculous in the eyes of the English. 
Your advice to the French, namely that they might ultimately arriver 
à un arrangement quelconque avec les Broussistes, h i.e. deliberately go 
and present their backsides to be kicked, has, quite understandably, infu­
riated them. The above advice, and your annoyance at the fact that we— 
for the pamphlet was embarked upon at my instigation and almost 
wholly edited by me 386—should have presented the Possibilists for what 
they are—recipients of reptile funds30 of the Opportunists,199 i.e. haute 
finance0—thereby opening the eyes of large numbers of Englishmen to 
things which had been deliberately withheld from them,—your annoy­
ance,  I say, is explicable only if you were intent on keeping a foot in the 
back door so that—even after being spurned by the Possibilists—you 
might cook up some little deal for the account and at the risk of the 
German party. If that's how things are, then I am not at all sorry to have 
taken some of the wind out of your sails. 
This,  along with your opinion393  that Ede should have replied to the 
Justice with an editorial, i.e. in the Sozialdemokrat, i.e. in German and 
thus in a form neither accessible nor comprehensible to the English, 
shows that you are totally out of touch with conditions both in France 
and over here, and that your calculations are based on out-of-date infor­
mation and imaginary situations. Nor is anything else to be expected 
since you receive none of the relevant journals there and have no regular 
correspondence with anyone of note (I mean, of course, in the socialist 
a after the event - b  corne to an arrangement of some sort with the Broussists -

parties) in England and France. Ede is infinitely better informed than 
you are about all these matters, and you would do better to turn to him 
for information rather than haul him over the coals about matters in 
which he is and must needs be far and away your superior. 
That the pamphlet was not only the greatest service we could do you 
people, but also completely indispensable, is something I trust I shall be 
able to bring home, if not to you, then at least to Singer, when the two 
of you come over here. 
One thing I do know—you can arrange the next congress yourselves; 
I shall wash my hands of it. 
The Hague resolution was sent to me by Lafargue expressly for 
publication, as was absolutely essential after the brazen rebuff meted 
out to you by the Possibilists.394 So I'll damned well forget about 
etiquette and just wait and see whether anyone else besides you 
complains. 
As regards the date of the congress, any alteration to what has 
already been resolved will put fresh difficulties in the way of an under­
standing, since everybody will propose a different date and it will be 
the 10th of October before they have agreed upon, let us say, the 10th 
of August. For us to make proposals to you on this matter will serve 
no useful purpose and I can only hope that, after all this bother—for 
the past 4 weeks I haven't been able to do a stroke of work on Volume 
IIP because of this damned business—something real will actually 
come of it. 
Cordial regards to your wife and to the others when you see them. 
Your 
RE. 
I fully understand—and have plainly intimated as much to Lafargueb 
that you should want to avoid a set-to with the Possibilists which, be it 
noted, would take place with the consent of the powers that be, and with 
police protection for the Possibilists; in other words, out of gratitude for 
the favourable attitude you have adopted towards France since 1870, 
you would be beaten up as Prussians0 by the French.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 5 April 1889 
Dear Liebknecht, 
When I wrote to you yesterday I hardly expected that by today I 
should already be in a position to point the moral of my letter. 
Our pamphlet386—of which, 2,000 copies were distributed in London 
and 1,000 in the provinces and, thanks to Tussy, just at the right places— 
has acted like a bombshell, making a tremendous rent in Hyndman's and 
Brousse's tissue of intrigue, and this at the most crucial spot. The people 
over here, suddenly enlightened as to the real state of affairs, have now 
discovered that Hyndman has shamefully deceived them about the 
congress, the French socialist parties, the Germans and the Hague 
affair385 and has concealed the essentials from them. The rebellious, 
progressive elements in the Trades Unions,395 whom Hyndman was just 
in process of annexing, are now turning to Ede, and all are anxious for 
further enlightenment. Inside his own camp, the Social Democratic 
Federation,62 Hyndman has also encountered opposition, which means 
that our pamphlet has induced some uncertainty in the ranks of the 
Social Democratic Federation, the only sure ally the Possibilists had. 
The consequence, enclosed herewith, was Hyndman's backward-look­
ing and, as compared with his previous insolent language, almost hang­
dog, reply injustice* Never before has Hyndman beat so ignominious a 
retreat, and the article will bring us further victories. At one fell swoop

the Sozialdemokrat has attained in London a position of respect such as 
would otherwise not have accrued to it for years. And instead of abus­
ing us, they are now all but begging us to ensure that there should not, 
after all, be two congresses. 
Well, Ede is going to reply to the effect that he can only speak in his 
own name, but believes he can say that, should the Possibilists now 
instantly and unreservedly accept the Hague resolutions, it might not be 
too late to reach an understanding and he would be glad to do what he 
could to bring it about. 
Now that the Possibilists have also had bad news from Spain, their 
agent Gély having simply been sent packing in Madrid—where we are in 
full control—and having no prospects whatever anywhere else if you 
except a Trades Union in Barcelona, and now that the Belgians also 
appear to be taking a tougher line than they, the Possibilists, expected, 
there's every possibility that this final blow, which is causing their chief 
reserves to waver, will make them more amenable. In order that you may 
strike while the iron is hot, it might be a good idea for you to copy,— 
more or less—the enclosed letter to Ede, preferably just as it stands, and 
send it to him without delay. 396 I am sending the same letter to Bebel 
with the same request.397 Preferably just as it stands, however, for one 
single expression inappropriate to the situation over here would prevent 
us from using the thing. Then the letters might be published. What we 
hope to do is to induce Hyndman to influence the Possibilists along the 
lines we want, in which case they'd be bound to submit and we should 
have salvaged one congress. 
All this was agreed today between Ede and  myself. 
And now, having regard to my letter of yesterday,3 you may again call 
me the rudest man in Europe.

Dear Ede, 
I am very glad to hear that the Social Democratic Federation is show­
ing itself more conciliatory. But the rejection of the Hague resolutions 
by the Possibilists has forced us into the position of proceeding inde­
pendently and convoking a congress to which all will be admitted and 
a See previous letter

which will have the last word in its own affairs. Preparations for this are 
already under way and cannot be broken off. 
If the Social Democratic Federation earnestly desires an understand­
ing, it might perhaps still contribute thereto. There may yet be time. 
Such an understanding might possibly still be reached if the Possibilists 
were to accept the Hague resolutions purement et simplement* —but 
without delay, for, having already once been rebuffed, we can no longer 
allow ourselves to be trifled with. 
I cannot speak here in the name of the German Party since the faction 
is not now in session, and still less in the names of the other groups 
represented at The Hague. But one thing I will gladly promise: If, by the 
20th of April at the latest, the Possibilists can lodge with the Belgian 
delegates Volders and Anseele written notice of their unconditional 
acceptance of the Hague resolutions, from which we cannot deviate by 
a hair's breadth, I shall do all I can to promote an understanding and 
likewise the attendance of all concerned at the congress convoked by the 
Possibilists with due regard for the Hague resolutions. 
Your 
W.L. 
The date, 20 April, is important—because of the need to come to a 
decision before the Belgian National Congress on the 21st.398 
I also enclose something from the Sozialist™ —the Americans are 
wholly of one mind with Ede as to this. 
What has proved more effective than anything else over here has, in 
fact, been the publication of the Hague resolution385 concerning which 
Hyndman had disseminated nothing but lies and which has struck home 
all the more forcibly for restricting itself to the demand for things that 
were pretty well axiomatic.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 10 April 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
I have just seen Bonnier and we discussed the situation. 
As I expected, your request that the date of the congress be changed 
has spread confusion everywhere. Liebknecht has stated in the Berlin 
press that, since there is little hope of the congress being held this year 
in Paris, it would be advisable to hold it next year in Switzerland. The 
Swiss press has seized on this idea with enthusiasm. Bebel, evidently 
tiring of all these difficulties, is prepared to leave the whole thing to 
Liebknecht. And the Belgians will not reply, either to Bebel or to 
Liebknecht. 
Fortunately we know the Belgians' secret. Anseele, who is an honest 
man, wrote and told Bernstein about it: They intend to submit the 
Hague resolutions385 to their national congress at Jolimont on 22 April, 
and their national council will act only after authorisation by the 
congress. That is how the good folk of Brussels interpret international 
action. 
The thing's as plain as daylight. It will give the Brussels Possibilists a 
whole month to compound and intrigue with the Paris Possibilists; at 
the Jolimont congress they will put forward a proposal made by Brousse 
& Co., offering a few more or less derisory concessions (depending 
upon the position at the time), the Belgians will accept and will suggest 
that the others be satisfied with these great and magnanimous conces­
sions.  And, since the masses are always in favour of conciliation, and 
since the lesser nationalities dote on congresses, the Dutch, the Danes, 
the Swiss themselves, the Americans and,—who knows?—maybe also 
Liebknecht, will come out in favour of unity and of a Paris congress in 
1889,  short of having another tipsy session in Switzerland in 1890. For 
this much is certain: should the idea gain ground that the 1889 anti-
Possibilist congress in Paris has been shelved, the Possibilists will have 
won the day, and everyone will attend their congress save only, perhaps, 
for the Germans. 
It is what I have been telling you from the very start. You wanted 

=====第306页=====
Letters -1889 295 
everything and now you run the risk of getting nothing. 
There is still a chance of saving the situation, and this we have 
resolutely seized upon. 
Our pamphlet386 has created an immense stir here, as I have told you. 
You have no doubt had a letter from the committee of the rebellious 
Trades Unionists395 who have written to Bernstein and to others besides. 
Although they incline towards the Possibilist congress, they are still in 
doubt. And in the Social Democratic Federation,62 too, there are rebel­
lious elements, otherwise Hyndman would not have written last 
Saturday's article.* We have thus undermined the Possibilists' reserves 
and must now follow up the advantage we have gained. 
Bernstein has therefore written to Justice^ saying that, in view of that 
journal's more conciliatory style, and speaking only for  himself,  it 
might not be too late to come to an understanding; that {{Justice so 
greatly desires such an understanding, it need only urge the Possibilists 
to accept the Hague resolutions unreservedly and forthwith; that two 
points—the admission of all on an equal footing, subject to ratification 
by the congress, and the sovereignty of the congress—are not open to 
discussion; they must take it or leave it; but that, if the Possibilists were 
to accept immediately, he would do his best to promote general agree­
ment. 
He and Tussy went to see Hyndman on Monday evening to hand him 
this reply, which is going to be inserted. They took advantage of the 
occasion to let him know that they were better acquainted than he with 
the situation abroad and no less well than he with that in England, and 
that there was no hope of his bamboozling them with his usual tricks. 
They told him that, if there were two congresses, ours would be 
attended, not only by the Germans, Dutch, Belgians and Swiss, but also 
by the Austrians, Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, Romanians, Americans 
and by those Russians and Poles living in the West. They made it clear 
to him that they knew perfectly well the extent to which his personal 
position over here had been undermined by our disclosure of the lies 
disseminated by him regarding the situation in France, etc. They gained 
the impression that his friends the Possibilists had themselves deceived 
him on several counts, and left, convinced that he would do all he could 
to make the Possibilists give way.

We have also had a letter from Liebknecht in which he undertakes to 
do what he can to bring about conciliation, on condition that the Hague 
resolutions are unreservedly accepted by the Possibilists before 20 April. 
I am also awaiting one from Bebel, whereupon we shall make use of 
them. It is stated in both that in no circumstances shall we budge an inch 
on the two main points. 
According to Hyndman, the Possibilists were afraid of being chucked 
out of their own congress, hinc Mae  lacrimaeH 
In this way we shall foil the Brussels intrigues, by letting it be known 
from the outset that no compromise is possible. Either the Possibilists 
accept, in which case our victory over them will be complete; we shall 
have forced their hand, made them eat HUMBLE PIE, and trampled 
underfoot for good and all their claim to be the one and only French 
Socialist Party worthy of recognition; you will have all that you require 
and the congress will see to the rest if, as Bonnier tells us, you can satu­
rate it with delegates from the provinces. Or else they refuse, and then 
we shall enjoy the advantage of being seen by everyone concerned to 
have done our utmost towards conciliation. All the waverers will be for 
us, and we shall hold a congress in Paris in the autumn whatever 
Liebknecht may say, for by that time there will not be any one sitting on 
the fence anywhere. 
I am sending you two papers with articles relating to the congress 
from which you will see how much we are bestirring ourselves. 
What could be better, after all, than to destroy the Possibilists 
through their own congress, supposing it can be managed? 
Liebknecht thought he could get the Possibilists to rally round him in 
opposition to Brousse, in Brousse's despite and over Brousse's head! 
What an idea—ruling the world with Borsdorf for your capital! 
Give Laura a kiss from me. What is she doing? She isn't ill, is she?

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 17 April 1889 
Dear Liebknecht, 
I never doubted for one moment that you aborigines of Borsdorf 
were the better men—better, I might almost say, to the point of incorri­
gibility. 
Your conference at The Hague385 gets funnier and funnier. Lafargue 
and Bonnier (who is over here) know nothing about one resolution— 
what was to happen after the Possibilists' refusal—and neither Lafargue, 
nor Bonnier, nor Ede know anything about the other, the maintenance 
of secrecy. It must have been a curious sort of presidency and an odd sort 
of secretariat for something like that to have happened. So what we 
didn't know about we couldn't have abided by. 
That silence should have been observed until the Possibilists had 
refused goes without saying and this is what in fact happened. But after­
wards it was essential to let fly at once. And if, as usual, you yourself 
were unlucky enough to be prevented by unforeseen circumstances from 
doing so and if none of the rest of you stepped into the breach and 
Lafargue sent me the resolution precisely for the purpose of getting it 
published, it was damned well up to us—especially so, considering the 
circumstances over here—to take this responsibility upon ourselves and 
commit this horrendous breach of etiquette. 
Your joint protest,* you say, would certainly have had an effect alto­
gether different from that of our pamphlet386—indeed it would, if it had 
ever appeared in the first place. Why then hasn't it yet done so? What the 
devil is stopping you? You know as well as I do that it will never mate­
rialise or not at any rate until six months post festum.b 
Your little scheme for busting up the Possibilists by means of moral 
exhortations from Borsdorf and coming to an understanding with them 
over Brousse's head is a childish chimera from the execution of which, 
come to that, our 'railing' at the Possibilists will not be able to deter you.

After all, you can protest your innocence to the gentlemen for all you are 
worth. So long as the gentlemen you correspond with sail under 
Brousse's flag, they too are responsible for his intrigues, and to present 
these in the right light could not, one might have thought, be other than 
helpful to you. If everything that Brousse gets them to do is good and 
apparently they have, after all, absolutely no cause to oppose him. 
If Ede, who throughout the pamphlet speaks on his own behalf and 
adopts a line no different from the one he adopts in the paper*  itself,  has 
provided the public prosecutors with grist for their mill, the paper itself 
constitutes a far greater danger to you people than the pamphlet. In 
which case for heaven's sake write to the chaps over here, telling them to 
attack rather than defend you, or better still to shut up shop. And if 
you're on such uncertain ground, you ought above all to avoid meddling 
in such things as international congresses, etc. 
As to the Schlesinger business, 400 we should like to discuss this 
further by word of mouth. I haven't seen the piece yet, but this really 
cannot go on, a situation in which something of the kind—if only the 
advertisement—is able to appear under your own aegis and without you 
yourself protesting. What I myself shall feel it necessary to do about the 
matter will of course depend on the concoction's contents.

their regards.

Your letter to Edeb will not be  used.  It would be far better if you 
wrote to Leec along the same lines. 
In lighter vein: Last Friday Ede was at a socialist soirée for the eddi-

of political economy at the Working Men's College and has actually 
refuted Marx's theory of  value,  that 'we are only 2000 socialists in England 
but we are doing more than all the 700,000 Socialists in Germany'

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN VIENNA 
London, 20 April 1889 
Dear Kautsky, 
As regards Schlesinger, I shall have a word with Liebknecht when he 
comes over here in about a fortnight. I have already written to him 
outlining the essential points. But you might be so good as to send me 
the thing*—stuff of this sort is unobtainable over here and I shouldn't 
like to be in the position of having to accept everything he says at its face 
value. 
As to Schmidt, I have advised him to send you the ms. and see 
whether you can place it.b Schmidt has quietly developed into a Marxian 
and, as a result, no longer has any prospect of a university career, having 
been turned down by Halle—that noble university is confessional!—as 
a dissident and by Leipzig as a socialist,297 while the Swiss have begged 
him to spare them his presence. Just now he is trying to get someone to 
publish the thesis he wrote for his habilitationf the academic socialists402 
tell him it is too Marxist and really won't do. So the publishers are none 
too many. Schmidt came over to us entirely of his own accord, without 
any prompting and, indeed, despite numerous indirect warnings from 
myself,  simply because he could not set his face against the truth. As 
things are today that is greatly to his credit and he has, moreover, acted 
most courageously. 
Now the point is that I am the very person who must not read and 
pass an opinion on his ms. He is seeking to reply to the question I raised 
in the preface to Volume  II.298  But I mustn't come out prematurely with 
the contents of Volume III, and that is what is preventing me from 
taking a direct hand in the business. So I can't be of any help to you this 
time. 
He—Schmidt—has thrown himself into journalism in Berlin; how 
he'll get on I have no idea. At all events he has behaved with more energy 
and good sense than I credited him with. For a journalist, his style is

then take a rest.354 That damned Paris congress is causing me nothing but 
vexation. What a muddle! Ede helps me and I help him, where possible,

Letters-1889 301 
international existence, for a Party which can neither communicate 
with the others nor make its presence felt ceases in their eyes to exist. 
But enough of that. Can you really not see that what the Belgians 
have done405 has restored your freedom of action? That now, since you 
are so intent on it, you can convene your congress for whatever date you 
choose,  1 July, 14 July or  1 August? That it's by no means too late to do 
something about it now, provided you act at once and provided, as seems 
to be the case, you have at your back a Party prepared to foot part of the 
bill? 
I have written and told Bebel that I shall no longer feel able to advise 
you not to act and that, since mistakes have been made on all sides, you 
were right to complain.406 That was yesterday; today he writes407 to say 
that the Dutch intend to follow the example of the Belgians and send 
delegates to each of the two congresses; that the Germans will not go to 
the Possibilist congress, despite the votes of Auer and Schippel, who 
expressed a contrary opinion (Bonnier replied to both)408; that he, Bebel, 
is in favour of sending a delegation to your congress, which he suggests 
should be held in August; but that, in order to pass a definitive resolu­
tion, the deputies would have to meet,409 which cannot be done until the 
next session of the Reichstag on 7 May. 
Now, having already waited long enough, you cannot wait until 7 
May for an uncertain result. I shall therefore write to Bebel saying that 
you will probably act now, in accordance with your own views, and I 
shall beg him to prevent over-hasty resolutions, should the date you 
select not be altogether agreeable to them. 
There is very good reason for the Germans' reserve. Within the next 
day or two there is to be a monster trial of 128 Barmen-Elberfeld 
Socialists. In the bill of indictment now being drawn up, the public pros­
ecutor has made it known that, after sentence has been passed on the 128 
and the Reichstag has adjourned, he intends to accuse all the Party 
deputies of constituting the central committee of Germany's vast 
Socialist secret society.410 It's the most sinister ploy they have ever 
concocted against us. Included in the evidence is the convocation of the 
Wyden411  and St. Gallen congresses. We knew all about this five or six 
weeks ago and it was fear of providing additional material for the indict­
ment which inhibited Bebel from doing anything. 
As for the attitude of the Dutch, it seems a bit dubious to me, consid­
ering the way Nieuwenhuis behaved at The Hague.412 
Bernstein believes that, if the two congresses meet at the same time, 
this would suffice to create a climate of opinion, especially among the 

=====第313页=====
302 Letters- 1889 
foreign delegates, that would be strongly in favour of a merger. You will 
be able to judge whether or not this view holds water; in any case, 
supposing the above should happen, your congress might very well join 
the other, on the invitation of the whole  congress  and after verification of 
credentials by each congress individually. If you freely assent to voting 
by nationality, the sovereignty of the congress will be saved. 
Bernstein also tells me that, as regards propaganda in Germany in 
support of your congress, the Sozialdemokrat will do its utmost, despite 
the right honourable deputies; he says: 'They have asked me so often to 
pursue an independent policy that would enable them to disown the 
Sozialdemokrat, supposedly their organ, that I shall oblige them for 
once.  This might, of course, lead the deputies to issue a categorical order, 
but we haven't nearly got to that stage yet.' 
So my advice is that you assemble your committee,413 convene the 
congress, settle on the date you think best in the circumstances, and 
write a convocation circular, which Laura will translate into English and 
I shall gladly translate into German. All this will take until next week 
and if, in the meantime, further news arrives involving, perhaps, some 
minor alteration, there will still be time enough. Your circular should be 
printed in French by the end of next week and distributed forthwith. I 
shall send you the addresses you will need. Printing in English and 
German would be done over here. Your congress once convened for a 
definite date, the dispute will again revive and we shall help to keep it 
going. 
In your convocation circular you must stress the sovereignty of the 
congress and the purely provisional character of the rules laid down by 
you. You would also have to suggest some basis for representation, i.e. 
one delegate per local group—subject, of course, to confirmation by the 
congress. This has been kept open by the others in order that they might 
have three or four delegates per Paris group in the event of your being 
represented by one delegate per provincial group. By proposing a cut-
and-dried basis, you would force the others to lay their cards on the 
table. 
To work then! You have a good two months ahead of you and that 
should be ample. And see that your convocation circular is concilia­
tory—the Possibilists are not sparing of soft soap, so the more thickly 
you apply it, the better things will go. You are perfectly entitled to say 
that, while yet there was hope, you submitted to all the demands made 
by the others, but that it has now become your duty to take the initia­
tive. But play down the Belgian betrayal as much as you can—so as not

to give the Possibilists cause for rejoicing. Of one thing, however, we 
may be sure, and that is that, this time, the Belgians have done for them­
selves. They won't ever mislead anyone again.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 1 May 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
Since my letter of yesterday,3  Bernstein has received the following 
from Liebknecht: 
'In the present circumstances the congress can be saved only if the 
French act in such a way as to present a fait accompli; they should 
therefore convene the congress—seeing that the Belgian resolution405 
has made combined action on the part of members of the Hague 
conference385 impossible—and without the assent of the Germans, 
Austrians, Swiss (Danes, etc.) which, at this late date, cannot be ascer­
tained in advance. 
Tt is essential that the congress be convened for precisely the same 
day as that of the Possibilists (14 July) and strictly in accordance with 
the procedure laid down at The Hague, while expressly stating that the 
a See previous letter 

=====第315页=====
304 Letters -1889 
date,  14 July, was chosen, not in any spirit of competition with the 
other congress, but in the firm hope that feelings of solidarity would 
compel the two congresses to hold their sittings jointly.' 
This would be foolish; we, too, anticipate such an outcome, but to say 
so would be to play into the hands of the Possibilists, who would there­
upon dictate their own conditions. You might, perhaps, say that the two 
congresses, by holding parallel sessions, might themselves resolve all 
their differences. 
'At the same time, of course, a short exposé of the situation should be 
given, comprising recent events (the congresses at Troyes 329 and 
Bordeaux,331 negotiations with a view to achieving a merger, the 
conference, etc.)—but omitting any kind of anti-Possibilist polemic. 
'It should further be said: We would ask working-class and Socialist 
groups in other countries to indicate their assent to our convocation 
address by appending their signatures, there having been no time to 
obtain that assent beforehand. 
'If there is no fait accompli, there will be no congress; the Belgian 
vote has restored freedom of action to our French friends. Once 
presented with a fait accompli, people will come to the congress.' 
There you are—that's Liebknecht all over. He is capable of heroic 
determination, but only after he himself has so clouded the issue that 
nothing else will serve. 
For that matter, I agree with what he says, with the exception of what 
I have noted above. In drawing up your Convocation you cannot be too 
mealy-mouthed, not that this need prevent your saying that the raison-
d'être of your congress is the Possibilists' refusal to recognise the full 
and absolute sovereignty of that congress. 
After Liebknecht 's letter, you have no reason whatever to hesitate. So 
do something, hold your national congresses and, if you can, get all the 
delegates who attend them to go to the international congress that is to 
result therefrom. 
As soon as your circular414 comes out, we shall begin to agitate, first 
to promote your congress, and next to ensure that those delegates whom 
we cannot prevent from attending the Possibilist congress—Belgians, 
etc.,—be told that they must insist on a merger of the two congresses. 
But now that you have a free hand, don't hesitate, do not lose a 
moment; if your circular reaches us by Monday, or Tuesday morning

even, it will go into the Sozialdemokrat and be advertised in the Labour 
Elector. As soon as the date of your congress has been settled, there may 
be something further to be done over here, although the dishonourable 
action of the Belgians has done us untold harm. 
Yours ever,

London, 2 May 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
Now things are beginning to move. This is what Bebel writes: 
'Liebknecht and I have agreed that Lafargue and his friends should be 
urged to convene a congress immediately for 14 July. This we are 
doing in the conviction that, once the two congresses have met on the 
same day, it will prove impossible for them to hold separate sessions, 
and that they will join forces, whether the Possibilists like it or not. 
I think you people should now be satisfied. As soon as the convo­
cation circular is published by the French, we shall issue an open 
appeal to the Germans, asking them to elect delegates to the congress 
and indicating the procedure by which this may be done' (under 
German law). T have written in the same vein to the Austrians, and the 
Danes and Swiss will likewise be notified. In this way we shall, I hope, 
manage to expropriate the Possibilists—or at any rate well and truly 
thwart their plan.'415

4.30 p.m. I am just back from Bernstein's who, however, was not at 
home. He has had a postcard from Liebknecht in which the latter says 
that you are at liberty to make use of 'their names' as having assented to 
your congress. 'Their names' presumably means Bebel and Liebknecht, 
for they are not as yet officially entitled to commit the German Party. I 
didn't see the card but Bonnier, who dropped in while I was out, told 
Nim about it. 
I hope to get a few lines from you tomorrow morning which would 
enable me to rekindle Bebel's ardour by telling him that you are now 
taking action. 
Don't forget, by the bye, to return to me, deciphered, the letter from 
Lyons.416 I must not keep the workmen there waiting for an answer. 
Now that you've got several provincial papers, choose one to be your

The (German)3 Americans although pressed by the Possibilists and 
Hyndman have said that it is you they still favour, and not the 
Possibilists. If they get your circular in time, I have no doubt they will 
give their assent, but they will go to some congress or other. 
Arbejderen is the radical opposition paper run by Petersen (who was 
acquainted with Rouannet and Malon in Paris, but has changed greatly 
since then) and by Trier, translator of my Origin of the Family. For tacti­
cal reasons you would be well-advised not to send them anything that is 
not simultaneously dispatched to the Socialdemokraten, organ of the 
moderate majority.418 
The address of P. Christensen, delegate to London (a good one)419  is

for Anseele (E.). At the Jolimont congress 405 the Ghent people declared 
that they would not attend the congress of the Possibilists so long as the 
latter persisted in their claims. The report in the Prolétariat is riddled 
with Possibilist lies. 420

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 7 May 1889 
My dear Laura, 
I was very glad to receive this morning the Convocation.414 As you 
say, there is no time to lose, and Paul who seems boiling over with virtu­
ous indignation had made me expect an interminable series of bureau­
cratic difficulties and delays. Now, as there has been such quick and 
determined action, everything is all right. The Convocation is short and 

=====第319页=====
308 Letters -1889 
sweet, contains the needful and no more, and all the fault I can find with 
it is that it would have been better to state in it, that the second circular 
with the signatures of the foreigners, unobtainable on account of want 
of time, would follow. Moreover I hope that the announcement, that the 
Socialist League21 had beforehand adhered to the Hague resolutions,385 
is founded upon fact and not upon a misunderstanding, as a disavowal 
on their part would be awkard. As to obtaining their signature, we ought 
to be informed of the contents of Morris' reply to Paul, so as not to be 
quite in the dark. 
Now will you make an English translation and Paul put at the 
bottom: 'For the English translation, Paul Lafargue'—and will he autho­
rise me to do the same with a German translation to be made by me? We 
will then get them printed here at once and spread them by the thousand; 
also forward you copies as you may require them. 
The loss of time is entirely due to Liebknecht who considers  himself, 
or would like to figure as, the centre of the international movement, and 
who,  being cocksure of bringing about a union, allowed himself to be led 
by the nose by the Belgians for six or eight weeks. Even now he is certain 
that if only he shows himself on the scene at Paris, the union will follow. 
But as it is not too late now, the lost time is not lost in reality. It has 
rallied round to the date desired by the French the mass of foreigners 
who at first objected and certainly would have abstained, had the date 
been settled without these preliminaries and against their wishes. 
Nobody suffers in reality through Liebknecht 's action, but we here, 
who,  having entered upon our campaign with uncommon success, were 
entirely left to our own resources, as all the letters addressed by the 
working men here whom we had stirred up against the Possibilist 
congress, were replied to in the most uncertain and vague way by Danes, 
Dutch, Belgians and Germans; and nobody could tell them anything 
about the other congress, in consequence of which they fell into the 
hands of Smith Headingley and Hyndman. Well, as soon as the English 
Convocation is out, we must begin afresh and I hope with better success. 
But if Paul thinks we can cram down people's throats, here in 
England, the fictio juris3 that the Possibilists are no socialists, that conse­
quently their congress does not exist at all or does not count, he is 
strangely mistaken. He says Bonnier's letter to the Labour  Elector* 21 was 
a bêtise 0 because it did not start from that point of view. Now I am 
a legal fiction - b a blunder 

=====第320页=====
Letters- 1889 309 
responsible for that bêtise as I wrote the letter and Bonnier only signed it. 
The Possibilists may be all that Paul says, and I believe him, but if he 
wants us to proclaim that publicly, he ought to have proved it first 
publicly, and before there was any question of a congress. Instead of that, 
our people made a conspiration du silence against themselves, left the 
whole wide world of publicity to the Possibilists, who anyhow were 
recognized as socialists by the Belgians, Dutch and Danes and some 
English last autumn in London 320; and the decree of excommunication 
launched by a party which even now has not a paper in Paris in which it 
can make itself heard, cannot and will not be accepted by the rest of the 
world without further  proof.422  We must speak to people here a language 
which they understand and to talk in the way Paul wants us to do, would 
be to make ourselves ridiculous and to be shown the door at every office 
of a paper in London. Paul knows too well that the Possibilists are a 
power in Paris, and though it may be very well for our Parisian friends to 
ignore them, we cannot do the same, nor deny the fact that there will be 
two rival congresses on  14 July. And if we were to tell people here that in 
our Congress 'ce sont les ouvriers et les  socialistes  de France sans distinc­
tion de parti qui convoquent le congrès' * that would not only be a bêtise 
but a gross untruth, as Paul knows well enough that the ouvriers de Paris, 
as far as they are socialists at all, are in their majority Possibilists. 
Anyhow we shall here continue to work for the Congress in our own 
way and never mind faultfinding. I have not yet done a single act in this 
affair but it has been found fault with by someone. So I am quite used to 
that sort of thing and go on acting as I think is right. 
The finest thing of it all is that three months after these two 
congresses Boulanger will be in all probability dictator of France, do 
away with parliamentarism, epurate the judges under pretext of corrup­
tion, have a gouvernement à poigne 0 and a chambre pour rire, c and crush 
Marxists, Blanquists and Possibilists all together. And then, ma belle 
France— tu l'as voulu\ AA2i 
Six months after that we may have war—that depends entirely on 
Russia; she is now engaged in vast financial operations to restore her 
credit and cannot well go in for a fight until these are finished.424 In that 
war the neutrality of Belgium and Switzerland will be the first thing that 
goes to smash, and if the war becomes really serious, our only chance is 
a 'it is the workers and socialists of France, without distinction of party, that 
convene the congress' - b strong government -c mock chamber - my beautiful 
France - that's what you wanted!

that the Russians be beaten and then make a revolution. The French 
cannot make one while allied to the Czar—that would be high treason. 
But if no revolution interrupts the war, if it is allowed to run its course, 
then that side will win which is joined by England, if England goes in for 
the war at all. For that side can then, with the help of England, starve out 
the other side by cutting off the corn supplies from abroad, which all 
Western Europe requires nowadays. 
To-morrow there will be a deputation to the Star to protest against 
last Saturday's article on the Congress (Bax, Tussy, Edward)425 which 
article was smuggled in, probably by Hyndman and Smith Headingly, in 
Massingham's absence.

Ever yours

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 343 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 11 May 1889 
Dear Sorge, 
There's so much writing and running about to be done in connnection 
with the damned congress that I hardly have any time left for other 
matters. It's the devil of a job—nothing but misunderstandings, rows 
and vexation all round, and in the end there'll be nothing to show for it. 
The Hague Conference people385 allowed the Belgians to make fools 
of them. Instead of at once proceeding, as had been decided after the 
Possibilists'19 refusal, to protest and convoke a rival congress (which 

=====第322页=====
Letters- 1889 311 
ought to have been done jointly by the Swiss and Belgians), the Belgians 
did nothing, obstinately refused to answer any letters and ended up by 
trotting out the lame excuse that they had got to submit the matter to 
their national congress—21/22 April405  —! Whereupon the others did 
nothing whatever (because, through the Swiss, Liebknecht was intrigu­
ing with some of the Possibilists since it was he who must succeed in 
bringing about an understanding), and thus the Possibilists captured all 
the publicity with their proclamations while our chaps either remained 
silent or, when asked about the possibility of a rival congress by such 
Englishmen as were still wavering, returned nothing but non-committal 
answers. The ultimate outcome of this cunning policy was that even in 
Germany our people turned rebellious, and Auer and Schippel 
demanded that delegates be sent to the Possibilist congress. 408 This 
finally opened Liebknecht's eyes for him and, after I and Ede Bernstein 
had told the French they were now at liberty to convoke their congress, 
also on the 14th of Julya as originally intended, he wrote and told them 
exactly the same thing. And so the French have got their way, but are 
rightly cursing Liebknecht's procrastination and general jiggery-pokery, 
the blame for which they are laying on the Germans as a whole. 
In this country, however, it is we who are having to suffer worst from 
Liebknecht's clever-clever goings-on. Our pamphlet386  had struck home 
like a thunderbolt and shown up Hyndman & Co. for the liars and 
cheats they are; everything was in our favour and, if Liebknecht had 
been prompt to act vis-à-vis the Belgians, as he damned well ought to 
have done, or else had let them go hang and himself negotiated with the 
others, either convoking, or getting the French to convoke, the congress 
at some definite date, we should have won over the masses, and the 
Social Democratic Federation 62 would have deserted Hyndman. But as 
it was, we were fobbed off with assurances and told to wait; and, since 
the chief bone of contention in the Trades Unions here was whether to 
comply with the leaders' wishes and not send delegates to the congress 
or whether to defy them and send delegates regardless—the quality of 
the congress being of secondary importance and their sole concern, 
entry or non-entry into the international movement—it was clear that 
the chaps would join forces with those who know their own minds 
rather than with those who didn't. And thus we lost a splendid position 
we had only just won, nor, unless some miracle happens, will any 
Englishman of note attend our congress.

London, 11 May 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
We have never called you anything but 'the so-called Marxists' and I 
would not know how else to describe you. Should you have some other, 
equally succinct name, let us know and we shall duly and gladly apply it 
to you. But we cannot say 'aggregate',325 which no one here would 
understand, or anti-Possibilists, which you would find just as objection­
able and which would not be accurate, being too all-embracing. 
Tussy must have returned you your letter to the Star yesterday. Since 
Tussy's translation of the Convocation had already been in the hands of 
the Star the day before that, your paraphrase of the said document stood 
no earthly chance of being inserted. 
What we need are letters from Paris, sent direct to the Star, bearing the

Paris postmark and refuting the Possibilist calumnies which appeared in 
Saturday's and Tuesday's editions, namely, that Boulé's election 
campaign was run on Boulangist money, that Vaillant had acted as an 
ally of the Boulangists, etc. 426 I should say that you could do this 
perfectly well without ruffling your newly-found dignity as the one and 
only Catholic Church in matters connected with French Socialism. 
No other daily is so widely read by working men as the Star—the only 
one to which we have a measure of free access. In Paris, Massingham had 
Adolphe Smith for his guide and interpreter and was steered by him into 
the arms of Brousse and Co., who took possession of him, refused to let 
him go, made him tipsy with absinthe and vermouth, and thus succeeded 
in winning over the Star to the cause of their congress and making it swal­
low their lies. If you wish us to be of use to you over here, you must help 
us regain some influence over the Star by demonstrating that the course 
which it has been led to embark upon is a dangerous one and that, in fact, 
Brousse and Co. have been feeding it with lies. And here nothing will 
serve but letters of complaint about such articles, sent direct from Paris. 
Otherwise we shall be told as before that no one in Paris has complained, 
hence these things must be true. 
Aside from the Star we have only the Labour Elector, a very obscure 
and distinctly shady paper which depends on money from unavowed 
sources and is therefore highly suspect. You could most assuredly do 
with a bit of publicity here in England, so bombard the Star with 
complaints—you, Vaillant, Longuet, Deville, Guesde and tutti quanti? 
But if you leave us in the lurch, you can't complain if your congress is 
passed over in silence by the press and if the Possibilists are regarded 
over here as the only French Socialists and yourselves as a worthless 
clique of intriguers and nincompoops. 
For the past three months Tussy and I have done virtually nothing 
but labour on your  behalf;  we had won the first battle with Bernstein's 
pamphlet,386  when Liebknecht 's inertia and irresolution lost us in rapid 
succession all the positions we had previously gained. Now that we are 
back on the defensive and threatened with the loss of even those posi­
tions we originally held, it is very hard to find ourselves similarly aban­
doned by the French when a few letters, however short, arriving at the 
right moment, could prove so very effective. But if you are bent on 
losing all means of publicity in England at the very time when it could 
be of greatest moment to you, there's nothing we can do about it; I, for 
a all the rest

one, will certainly have learnt my lesson; I shall go back to Volume 3,a 
abandoned for the past three months, and shall not be unduly upset if 
the congress comes to nothing. 
To organise lodgings and eating-places for the delegates is an excellent 
idea—Bebel wrote and told me about itb and, since Paris in July will be 
positively swarming with people, this is of the utmost importance. 
We shall have Laura's English translation414  printed. As for the 
German translation, one has appeared in the Sozialdemokrat of which 
one sentence towards the end was amended by Bernstein (No. 3 in your 
invitation) as being too dangerous for the Germans. Send the French text 
of the Convocation which is to be signed by everyone to Bebel and 
Liebknecht so that they can let you know what passages they cannot 
sign without compromising themselves in the eyes of the law, for other­
wise you will run the risk of not getting any German signatures. I shall 
wait until I have heard from Bebel before printing the German transla­
tion here, and shall first submit to you the changes he suggests. 
It is some time since Labusquière's name has appeared in the 
Possibilist press—can he, too, have joined the ranks of the malcon­
tents? 427 The incipient disorganisation of the Possibilists is undoubtedly 
agreeable to ourselves, but our onslaughts upon them, combined with 
the congress, may well bring about a return to unity. In any case, the 
disintegration is not yet so far advanced as to make any impact on the 
Possibilists' allies abroad. 
Herewith cheque for £20.—As for Ferry's coup d'état, 428 it might well 
fail, for in 1889 the foot-slogger is much more of a Boulangist than he 
was a Republican when he disrupted MacMahon's coup. 198 The worthy 
Boulanger would not be so stupid as to evoke a call to arms over the 
High Court affair, but the same might not apply if there were to be a 
direct violation of the Constitution. That Ferry will not surrender 
power, direct or indirect, without a struggle, I can readily believe. But 
there is a risk.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 14 May 1889 
My dear Laura, 
Could not your people in Paris, now that things are mending and 
going on swimmingly, look with a little less morosity upon what we are 
trying to do in order to help them? Nobody has asked them to enter into 
polemics with the Star, nor write long refutations. But supposing 
Vaillant wrote to the Star: 'In your No.- you assert, on the strength of 
Possibilist assertions made to you, that I ... (did so and so, Star, May 
7th). b I have not the time nor you the space to refute in detail such 
rubbish. I merely ask you to allow me to state, in your next issue, that 
this is an infamous calumny' (or something of the sort).

And supposing the Treasurer, Chairman, or Secretary of Boulé's 
Committee 344 wrote: 'In your issue etc. you say that Boulé's election was 
supported by Boulangist money. As Chairman (or whatever he was) of 
Boulé's Committee, I know where the very small amount of money we 
could dispose of, has come from—all from working men's subscriptions. 
I therefore declare the above assertion which was made to you by 
Possibilists, to be an infamous lie' etc. 
And so a few more by different people. That would strengthen our 
hands with the Star very much. 
Especially at this moment. This morning's Star has Paul's invita­
tion430—I am afraid, put in in order to give hima an excuse not to put in 
the official Convocation with all the signatures. Still, Bernstein shall try 
him again with that (copy enclosed) in a day or two. And Edward and 
Bonnier saw him this morning, when he promised to put in a letter of 
Bonnier's tomorrow1, and asked Bonnier to dinner for next Monday 
when Bonnier must try and work him. You see the iron is still a little hot 
and may be welded if only we could be supported by a few blows from 
Paris.  If we do not strike now, it will be too late soon. 
You say the Paris Committee413 will work by its numerous procla­
mations and that is better than letters to the Editor. Most certainly; but 
the letters to the Editor are wanted exactly for the purpose of getting 
him to insert the proclamations when they come. What use will be all the 
proclamations here when we cannot get them into any paper except the 
Labour Elector, which does perhaps more harm than good if it is the 
only paper to notice them? 
As part of the conversation with Massingham was carried on in 
English, not understood by Bonnier, I do not yet know all that 
happened. Anyhow I hope you will see that our plan of campaign—to 
maintain the position we had from the beginning and to keep the Star 
open for communications from our side—was the only one possible, and 
not quite so absurd as our Paris friends seem to think. We know that at 
the Star office great weight is laid upon such bombardments with letters 
from the outside public, and in this case it is the more important as you 
know yourself that Possibilists, Smith Headingly and Hyndman 
all'unisono shout into Massingham's ears that the whole affair is a 
personal affair of the Marx family and nothing else.

I have written to Bebel431  to write to Danes and Austrians to hurry on 
with their signatures, and through the Danes, work on the Swedes and 
Norwegians, and also I have consoled him about his fear of not getting 
lodgings and meals in Paris at the impending festive time. Bebel never 
having seen anything bigger than Berlin (for here he was only a few days 
and under good protection) is a little kleinstädtisch* in these matters. The 
sooner the circular with all the signatures appears, the better; that will 
tell best with people here. 
I am sure your people in Paris have every reason to be content. They 
have got what they wanted, and there is plenty of time left for every­
thing. Why then should they be so anxious to take revenge on friend and 
foe alike, look glum at every proposal made to them, try to find out diffi­
culties where there are none and grumble like John Bulls? Surely tout le 
gaîté française ne s'est pas évanouie* 0—let them become French again, the

defeat but this is not the decisive position and as you see we keep fight­

in flagrant contradiction to the facts and laying yourselves open to 
protests and refusals from abroad—and quite needlessly at that. Your 
dicta will not cause the Possibilists and their Paris majority to vanish 
into thin air. 
I have sent out the English circular to the weekly papers, tomorrow 
it will go to the daily press, to the London radical clubs,22 to Socialist 
organisations and to such influential people as may be interested. 
This will account for perhaps 1,000 copies, Tussy will dispose of 500 
others and Keir Hardie of another 500 in Scotland. The addresses and 
wrappers are ready, and everything will go off tomorrow so that by 
Saturday evening, when the clubs, Trade Unions, etc., meet, all will have 
been distributed. 
Bonnier's letter is in the Star.433 
Clara Zetkina has written an excellent article in the Berlin Tribune— 
had we had so exact an account of things three months ago, it would 
have helped us a great deal. Bernstein will make good use of it when he 
goes to see Massingham tomorrow, as also of the affair of the 13th427 
whose significance was not apparent from the Egalité article, but all the 
details of which she has given to Bernstein. 
You are quite right not to locate the National Council in Paris—since 
your strength lies in the provinces, it is there rather than in Paris that the 
official leadership belongs. That the provinces should be better than 
Paris is, moreover, a very good sign. 
Tomorrow will see the first performance of another of Aveling's 
plays. 434 Although he has not taken the public by storm, he is attracting 
the notice of some critics, even those who have hitherto adhered to the 
conspiracy of silence. 
The miners' strike in my part of Germany (Barmen lies some five or six 
miles from the edge of the coal-field) is an event of the very greatest  signif­
icance.435  Whatever the outcome, it will open up territory hitherto closed 
to us and, as of now, will earn us 40,000-50,000 more votes in the elec­
tions.  The government is scared  stiff,  for any attempt at resolute action or, 
as they say in Prussia (although the term is an Austrian one), 'schneidiges 
Handeln \b might precipitate a week of bloodshed, as happened in Paris in 
1872.  Henceforward the miners will be ours throughout the length and 
breadth of Germany—and they are a force to be reckoned with.

POST-TIMEI 
Yours ever, 
F. E. 
I shall write to Danielsona 
International Socialist Working Men's Congress. 
14th to 21st July, 1889. 
Workers and Socialists of Europe and America, — 
The Bordeaux331 Working Men's Congress, held by the delegates of 
upwards of 200 trades unions from all the industrial centres ofFrance,h 
and the Troyes329 Congress, constituted by the delegates of 300 work­
men's  andc  Socialist groups representing the French^ working class 
and revolutionary Socialism at large, have resolved to convene an 
International Congress in Paris, during the Exhibition, that shall be 
open to the workers of the whole world. 
This resolution has been joyfully welcomed by the Socialists of 
Europe and America, happy to be able to meet and to clearly formu­
late the demands of the working-class on the subject of international 
labour legislation, which question will be treated at the Berne 
Conference, to be held by the representatives of the Governments of 
Europe in September. 
The capitalists invite the rich and mighty to the Universal 
Exhibition, to contemplate and admire the achievements of the work­
ers doomed to misery in the midst of the most colossal wealth ever 
possessed by any human society. We, Socialists, whose aim is the 
emancipation of labour, the abolition of wage-slavery, and the creation 
of an order of things in which all workers—without distinction of sex 
or nationality—shall have a right to the riches produced by their 
common toil; it is the producers whom we invite to meet us on the 
14th July in Paris. 
We call on them to seal the  bond e of fellowship that, by consolidat­
ing the efforts of the proletariat of all countries, will hasten the advent 
of the new world.

—to seal the bond may give rise to difficulties. The Germans are 
forbidden to have any kind of organisation whatever and such as they 
have in defiance of the law is regarded as a secret society. Hence one 
must avoid any expression which suggests the idea of formal organisa­
tion. Bid them to a fête of solidarity, to a public demonstration of frater­
nity—anything you please, so long as you do not invite them to form an 
official organisation or words to that effect, as the English jurists say. 
It also seems to me that one or two good sentences are needed to 
make an effective ending. 
And you might tell the international Socialists who are going to sign 
this that the details of place of meeting, etc., will be communicated later 
by the Paris commission. A little prose after so much rhetoric would not 
come amiss. It would be more businesslike.

My dear Lafargue, 
Herewith 25 English circulars.422 
When are you going to send me back the—deciphered—letter from 
Lyons  ?a I wouldn't like to seem negligent or in any way discourteous 
towards French working men. 
Since the Sozialdemokrat and the Berlin Volksblatt have published 
a See this volume, p.306

German translations, there is no further need for a separate edition to be 
printed over here. In any case, which text ought we to use? 
1) French text: The Socialist League of England21 and the Danish 
Socialists ... have given their prior assent to the resolutions to be taken. 
2) English text: W. Morris of the Socialist League and the Danes, etc., 
etc. 
3) German text in the Berlin translation (probably Liebknecht's): The 
Socialist League and the Danes have made their excuses, and the Socialist 
League has given prior assent to the resolutions, etc., (according to this 
version the Danes did not assent). 
Since the Possibilists have German friends in Paris and English ones 
over here, it seems not unlikely that they will get wind of these discrep­
ancies. That would be most undesirable, and we can only hope it won't 
happen; but you can also see what might result from yet another circu­
lar,432  featuring yourselves as 'the whole of the French working class'— 
the translations would again vary, for you may be sure that Liebknecht 
would change that in the German. 
A hundred English circulars go off to America tomorrow. 
The Star hasn't printed the circular yet. Massingham was out when 
Bernstein called yesterday. 
Aveling's play went off better than I had hoped—it's a sketch, very 
well made, but ends, after the manner of Ibsen, without a solution— 
something to which English audiences are not accustomed. The piece 
preceded another—by Baby Rose and someone else436 —a very free 
English version of Conflicto entre dos deberes* by Echegaray. This one, 
being strongly spiced with sensationalism, went down very well, 
although ponderous and vulgar and in the English taste. 
Yours ever,

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 20 May 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
I am sending you two newspapers, 1) Reynolds3  which, at Tussy's 
request, printed the circular but without the signatures. This provides you 
with a first-rate pretext for writing to them as follows: 'The Commission 
of Organization is very much obliged to you for publishing in your paper 
our circular of convocation for the International Working Men and 
Socialist Congress at Paris to be opened on July 14th, but as you have not 
given any address will you allow me to state, through your columns, that 
all communications from abroad are to be sent to the undersigned Foreign 
Secretary to the Commission. Yours etc. P. Lafargue, Le Perreux, Paris, 
Banlieue, May—etc.,' or something of that sort. 
2) The Sun, a new radical Weekly, which carries one paragraph, again 
thanks to Tussy's influence.437 We shall have to see if there isn't some 
way in which we can make further use of this newspaper, but the influ­
ence of the Star might do us a mischief here. 
Injustice, which I shall send you as soon as I have some copies of it, 
Hyndman gives vent to a cry of triumph438  in the belief that, along with 
the Star, he has deprived us of all means of publicity in London. He says 
that, though you are an amiable and estimable man, you are making a 
fool of  yourself,  and Bebel, Liebknecht and Bernstein likewise; and he 
hopes that we shall at last desist from our futile intrigues, etc. 
Have you seen the Prolétaire (or Parti ouvrier}) in which the 
Possibilists say they are sure of the Danes? 439 Bernstein has written to 
Germany to find out what it's all about. 
The moment he no longer feels the boulevards under his feet, 
Rochefort insists on making a fool of himself—in Geneva when he quar­
relled with old Becker, here, by drawing his revolver in Regent Street 
after he had been given a slap in the face. The case is to be heard today 
in the Police Court 440; I shall send you the paper.

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN VIENNA 
London, 21 May 1889 
Dear Kautsky, 
At last a few minutes in which to write to you. The damned congress 
and everything connected with it has taken up all my time for the past 3 
months; there's the devil of a lot of writing, running about and slaving to 
do, and nothing comes of it but vexation, trouble and strife. At St 
Gallen, 174 our worthy Germans imagined, as they have done ever since, 
that they only had to convoke a congress for it to happen—jehi  ôr, vajebi 
ôr*\ (get Adler to tell you what that means). Having themselves got over 
their internal quarrels, they imagined that love and friendship, peace and 
harmony, prevailed throughout the socialist world, and it never occurred 
to them that convoking a congress would mean either submitting to the 
Brousse-Hyndman alliance or else combating it. Now, however, having 
had ample experience they still seem to be somewhat in the dark and flat­
ter themselves with dreams of the merger of both congresses at the 
instant of meeting; thus they abjure the only mode of combat capable of 
bringing this about, namely snarling defiance at Brousse and Hyndman. 
Anyone who knows anything about these men is aware that they will 
only cede to force and regard every concession as a sign of weakness. 
Instead, Liebknecht demands that we treat them considerately, not only 
handling them with kid gloves but even going so far as to give them a 
helping hand. Liebknecht has made a mess of the whole business. The 
a let there be light: and there was light (Genesis, 1.3)

324 Letters-1889 
Hague Conference, described over here as a caucus441 by Hyndman 
because he wasn't invited (which in itself was a stupidity), could, in the 
absence of the Possibilists, only acquire significance and become some­
thing more than a caucus if other signatures—those of the Austrians, 
Scandinavians, etc.—had been secured after the event. That would also 
have brought pressure to bear on the Belgians. Nothing of the kind, 
indeed nothing whatsoever, was done; the Hague business, which had 
been a good start, was also, it seemed, to be the finish. Well, after the 
Possibilists' refusal, the Belgians dragged their feet, refused to reply and 
eventually said that they wanted to leave the decision to their congress 
on 21 April.405  Instead of sending somebody to force the Belgians to give 
a prompt yes or no and then induce the others to act accordingly, they 
allowed everything to slide. Liebknecht made commemorative speches 
in Switzerland 442 and, when we let fly over here—at a crucial moment so 
far as this country was concerned—, he began to fume, alleging that we 
had infringed the secrecy agreed upon in regard to the Hague resolu­
tions385  (secrecy it would have been madness to observe after the 
Possibilists' refusal, and of which, moreover, we knew nothing), that we 
had frustrated, etc., his move to bring the Possibilists over to our side 
over the heads of Brousse, etc. (!). And when, at our instigation, the 
English—discontented Trades Unionists 395 —, sought information from 
Belgium, Holland, Germany and Denmark about the position as regards 
our congress, they got nothing but vague, noncommittal replies and, 
needless to say, came down in favour of the men who knew their own 
minds, the Possibilists. So months were spent dithering and dawdling 
while the Possibilists swamped the whole world with their circulars, 
until in the end people lost patience, even in the German camp, and 
insisted on attendance at the Possibilist congress.408 This made its mark 
and, 24 hours after we over here had told the French that the resolutions 
of the Belgian congress405  had set them at liberty to do as they pleased, 
and that they, too, could convoke their congress for the 14th of July,— 
24 hours later, up comes Liebknecht with this self-same and hitherto so 
hotly contested proposal. The fact of the matter is that, if he is to be 
capable of reaching a bold decision, he must first get himself into a 
complete and utter mess. 
But now it is, in many ways, too late. Over here the battle has been 
lost all along the line because we were left in the lurch at the crucial 
moment. People who sympathised with us could count themselves 
lucky to be selected—to go to the other, Possibilist congress. In 
Belgium, thanks to those intriguers in Brussels, the Possibilists have all

Letters-1889 325 
but gained the upper hand; Anseele, in other respects a good chap, 
seems anxious to avoid a breach with the Brussels lot. And even the 
Danes seem to be wavering, and they'll be followed by the Swedes and 
Norwegians, who admittedly do not yet count for very much, but 
nevertheless represent 2 nations. When one considers the way in which 
Liebknecht has so utterly compromised, if not actually in part ruined, 
the magnificent international position enjoyed by the Germans, it's 
enough to drive one mad. 
Close alliance with the Austrians; the Americans up till now merely 
a branch of the German party; the Danes, Swedes, Norwegians and 
Swiss as it were offshoots of the Germans; the Dutch a reliable inter­
mediary for the West; add to that, German colonies everywhere and 
the non-Possibilist French almost wholly dependent on their alliance 
with the Germans; likewise the Slav colonies and refugees in the West, 
who have also been gravitating towards the Germans ever since the 
fiasco of the anarchists:—what a magnificent position it is! And all 
this placed in jeopardy by Liebknecht's illusion that he only has to 
open his mouth for all Europe to dance to his tune, and that, unless he 
gives the order to advance, the enemy won't do anything either. And, 
thanks to Bebel's comprehensible but most regrettable ignorance of 
foreign affairs, Liebknecht has had a pretty free hand. If things go 
wrong, it will be he who is to blame because of his failure to do 
anything (save intrigue) and his failure to make a public stand between 
the time of the Possibilists' refusal early in March and the Belgian 
congress on 22 April. 
However, I think all may yet be well, provided we all of us pull 
together. If we can win over the Danes, we shall carry the day—but it so 
happens that it's only from Germany—i.e. through Liebknecht —that 
influence can be brought to bear on them. Yet it's absolutely maddening 
that we should have got into this frightful predicament at all, when swift 
action in March and early April must have secured us the whole of 
Europe. The Possibilists acted, whereas Liebknecht not only failed to 
act, but also made it impossible for anyone else to do so—the French 
might not lift a finger, come to any decision, issue a circular or convoke 
a congress—until it finally dawned on him that for the past six weeks the 
Brussels people had been leading him by the nose and that the effect of 
the Possibilists' activities, in contrast to his own masterly inactivity, was 
to make his own Germans desert him. And on top of all that there was 
the business of that scoundrel Schlesinger. 400 He, Liebknecht, has 
appealed to my better feelings, saying that the least public move might

ruin him, load him with debts to the tune of 6,000 marks and force him 
to emigrate to America. In these circumstances I shall wait—or so I 
think just now at any rate—until the whole thing has been published, 
and then see what ought to be done. However, the business is most 
compromising so far as he's concerned, and if he imagines he can simply 
get away with allowing his name to be attached to anything so 
unsavoury, he's in for a surprise. Would you be so kind as to send me the 
next instalments? The rascalV overweening arrogance is only matched 
by his crass ignorance. You're perfectly right; if Liebknecht's name 
didn't feature on it, it would simply be a joke. 
What is Louise doing? Is she still busily engaged in helping to multi­
ply the human species? I trust she is well and happy and that she got 
through her last exam.354  Nim and I send her our love. Presumably she 
will now be able to take a bit of a rest. 
I have had to give up smoking because of its effect on my nerves and 
more especially on my heart, which is otherwise very sound. I have also 
got to cut down my drinking a lot, its effect being more marked when 
the nerves are disordered. I am taking sulphonal to help me sleep, and 
spend a lot of time in the open air in Hampstead and Highgate. That, 
too, is time-consuming. If only the damned congress were over, so that 
one didn't have to plough through so many newspapers; it prevents me 
from doing anything else and, when I do at last get round to some sensi­
ble reading, my eyes are too tired and I have to turn to some other occu­
pation. The doctor tells me my eyes won't ever be quite right again, 
though it's nothing serious, only a constant nuisance—i.e. having to

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 24 May 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
Do for goodness' sake expedite the circular432 with the foreign signa­
tures!  Here as everywhere else it will be of the greatest importance to us. 

=====第339页=====
328 Letters -1889 
Never mind the content, however colourless and devoid of rhetorical 
flourishes—it's the signatures that count. If it reaches us within the next 
eight or ten days, it will mean victory for us here, otherwise we shall lose 
the battle for the second time, and this time it will be the Parisians' fault. 
It is really so difficult to write a circular anyone can sign? 
Herewith Justice with a manifesto* of which the fury and bare-faced 
mendacity betray all too plainly the effect created here by the 
Convocation,414 even at this late hour. The Social Democratic 
Federation,62 you see,—or rather Hyndman—are well aware that what 
is at stake is their position over here, and likewise that of the Possibilists 
in France. We shall, of course, reply. But if we could append to our 
flysheet the Convocation with the foreign signatures, the effect would be 
tremendous. 
The Convocation has appeared in Commonweal}3 and Morris has 
come out openly in support of our congress. In the Labour Elector W. 
Parnell, a delegate to the London congress320 and a very good and capa­
ble chap—a worker—says he has got copies of the Convocation for 
anybody who may want one.443 A very good acquisition. Tussy has 
arranged a meeting for tomorrow at which Bernstein (over here we call 
him Ede, so if I happen to use that name, you will know whom I mean) 
will meet Burns, Tom Mann and other influential working men. Burns 
has been nominated for the Possibilist congress by his branch. It will be 
a very good thing to have men of that stamp at the Possibilist congress, 
supposing we cannot have them at our own. 
The Star has not yet printed Okecki's letter,0 but only Bax's on 
Vaillant.d We shall remind hime  about the former. As he wishes to 
promote the sale of his paper in Paris, we shall give him introductions to 
the radical Socialists of the Municipal Council, Longuet, Daumas, etc. 
What does Okecki say in his letter? Does he deny outright the imputa­
tion that Boulé accepted Boulangist money? You cannot conceive the 
importance—both to ourselves and to you—of this English daily, nor 
how much it would repay the trouble of getting it out of Hyndman's 
clutches. 
The manifesto in Justice claims that Farj at voted for the Possibilist 
congress (at the London congress). This cannot be true! I am asking him 
a 'Manifesto of the Social-Democratic Federation. Plain Truths about the

by this post to send us a letter we can publish.444  But no, on second 
thoughts, I haven't got his address, and the man I had in mind was Fréjac 
of Commentry and not Farjat. So you would be doing us a great service 
if you could obtain a letter of this kind for us, and as soon as possible, 
for over here there's no time to be lost if we are not to lose our public. 
I have written to Denmark to find out what is holding things up 
there445—but my correspondent belongs to the radical opposition and 
not to the moderates who lead the party. We have also written to Bebel, 
telling him how important it is to secure the Danes who, in turn, will be 
followed by the Swedes and Norwegians, and have suggested that one of 
the Germans should go there in person if things don't go well. 
And now, my dear Lafargue, make haste with the Convocation, 
signed by everybody concerned. It is the only effective way of stifling all 
the calumnies and lies put about by the others. And it is most important 
for the countries still hesitating that they should get it before they have 
made up their minds. Liebknecht, with his irresolution and dilatoriness, 
has cost us many a position; do not follow his example. For of one thing 
you may be certain—if you cause us to lose another battle by what 
others can only regard as incomprehensible delays, we over here shall be 
fully justified in losing patience and leaving you to 'shift for yourselves'. 
It is impossible to help people unless they are willing to help themselves 
just a little. So send out a circular of some sort, but not one liable to 
arouse opposition, to the Parties abroad without further delay, collect 
the signatures and have the thing printed, or send it to us for that 
purpose—with an English translation by Laura to save time. The 
prospects are so good, if only the lot of you would deign to put first 
things first, setting aside all petty rivalries and matters of detail. Don't 
ruin your own congress, don't be more German than the Germans. 
Love to Laura, 
Yours ever,

My dear Lafargue, 
From a letter written by Guesde to Bonnier I learn that the 
Convocation with the foreign signatures 432 has gone to the printers. You 
may add: 
K. Cunninghame-Graham, English Member of Parliament, and, 
unless you hear to the contrary by telegram on Monday, also 
W. Parnell 
Tom Mann . delegates to the 1888 London congress. 320 
The latter have not given their official assent. Bernstein saw them this 
morning, as also Graham and Burns, when the latter declared his inten­
tion of disassociating himself entirely from the Social Democratic 
Federation,62 saying that he is sick and tired of the underhand methods 
of Hyndman, who has ruined the Federation, that the circulation of 
Justice has dropped from 4,000 to 1,400 etc. Although elected to the 
Possibilist congress by his branch, he is going to support our line. How 
he can best set about doing so is still under discussion. 
Send a copy of the Convocation as soon as possible. 
Yours ever,

Send me the article for the Russian review,446 and I'll send it on to 
Danielson. 
Since Lavrov has turned coy,447  write to N. Axelrod, Képhir-Anstalt, 
Hirschengraben, Zurich and ask him to get you, besides his own, the 
signatures of Vera Zasulich (since you haven't got her address), and 
those of G. Plekhanov and other Russian Marxists. That will astound 
our worthy eclectic. 
The English Convocation432 is already at the printers; tomorrow I 
shall have the proofs, and distribution will begin the day after. 
Parnell has refused his signature as a private person, but has given it 
in his capacity as the HONORARY SECRETARY of the LABOUR 
ELECTORAL ASSOCIATION.449 
Since you must have received this signature, together with those of its 
other members (Champion, Mann, Bateman), I did not telegraph you, 
for you would, of course, take the signatures as sent to you direct, and 
not from my letter. 
The reason is that he is being sent by his TRADES UNION (cabinet 
makers) to the Possibilist congress, where he and Burns will support our 
line.  If the Possibilists oppose their proposal for a merger, they might 
even part company with them and join us. But that is, as yet, the music 
of the future.449

not agreement had been reached as to the text of the Convocation. But 
now things will get going over here as well.—It will be a thunderbolt. 
Your tactics are best, more especially since you haven't got a paper 
and since everyone in France has already taken sides. Here, where not a 
few are still sitting on the fence and where, in addition, we must try and 
shake the faith of those who have already gone over to the enemy—and 
it can be done—we must go into the attack. 
Tomorrow I shall at least, I hope, be able to put in a little anti-
Hyndman work450; today, all my time has been taken up with arrange­
ments for the English Convocation and with running errands. 
The letter from Lyons was in the enclosed envelope. I sent it to you 
so that you might decipher the name and address of the signatory for 
me. 416 It contained a request for copies of my writings. However, you 
appear to have received my accompanying letter asking you to enlighten

failure to call; I can only assume, however, that he forced your hand by 
the uncouthness of his behaviour vis-à-vis  yourself. 
The mood re the congress in which you wrote your letter was also 
mine from mid-March until nearly mid-May. Now, miraculously, all is 
saved, as you will see from the second circular we sent you containing 
the convocation with signatures from almost everywhere in Europe 
(brought up to date in the appendix to Bernstein's No.  II,450  sent off 
today). 
The first pamphlet, signed by Bernstein,386 was edited by me, like 
everything else that appeared in English on the subject. Such of it as you 
are able to find fault with was necessary from a local point of view. 
Particularly the explanations concerning the Possibilists which you see 
as attacks. But most necessary of all was the publication of the Hague 
resolutions394 which, in their wisdom, the chaps at The Hague had 
decided to keep secret, and ad infinitum at that. Fortunately no one 
either here or in Paris knew of this canny decision and we therefore let 
fly, since the Possibilists and their supporters over here were daily harp­
ing on those very resolutions, telling the most whopping lies about 
them, etc. 
Prompt action ought, of course, to have been taken after the 
Possibilists' refusal. But the Belgians, who were, after all, supposed to be 
convoking the congress along with the Swiss, didn't lift a finger—they 
wanted to put the matter off until their congress at Easter in Jolimont,405 
and take refuge behind such resolutions as might be adopted there. And 
of the Swiss, Scherrer, too, was a wee bit dilatory on the pretext that, 
with Liebknecht 's assent, he would lure the bulk of the Possibilists onto 
our side 'over the heads of Brousse & Co.'!! Liebknecht, however, was 
making commemorative speeches in Switzerland, 442 and Bebel was 
insufficiently acquainted with the terrain to go ahead independently in 
his absence. 
The real battlefield was here. The impact of Bernstein's pamphlet 
No. I here was that of a thunderbolt. People realised they had been 
outrageously hoodwinked by Hyndman & Co. Had our congress been 
convoked straight away, they would all have rallied to us, and Hyndman 
and Brousse would have found they were on their own. The discon­
tented elements in the Trades Unions here 395 appealed to us, to the 
Germans, the Dutch, the Belgians and the Danes. But from no one did 
they obtain any information about our congress—when, where or how 
it would be held. Their main concern, however, was with opposing 
Broadhurst, Shipton & Co. by sending delegates to a congress, no matter

which, and they therefore came down in favour of the one that had been 
convoked. 
Thus,  step by step, we lost ground here, and our foothold in this 
country's radical press grew distinctly precarious, on top of which came 
the resolution of the Belgian congress whereby one delegate was to be 
sent to each of the two congresses. And, even in the German party press, 
Auer and Schippel declared themselves in favour of attending that of the 
Possibilists,408  if only to show that the Germans weren't Francophobes 
and chauvinists. In short, I gave the thing up for lost, at any rate so far 
as England was concerned. 
However, I at once wrote to the French3  (who from the start had 
insisted that the congress must be held on 14/21 July, alongside that of 
the Possibilists, if it was to be worth holding at all) and told them that the 
Belgian resolution had restored their liberty of action and that they 
should immediately convoke the congress for that time. And Monsieur 
Liebknecht, galvanised by Auer's and Schippel's articles, tendered the 
same advice to the French, b having suddenly discovered that he had been 
dragging his feet long enough and rapid action was now called for. The 
convocation followed—and the impact it made exceeded all edpecta-
tions.  Letters of adhesion came flooding in and continue to do so. And 
even over here we have scored more than a succès d'estime, while the 
sensation created by the publication of the signatures has still not died 
down. Even in this country everything outside the (very down-at-heel) 
Social Democratic Federation is ours, as is, morally speaking, part of 
what's still inside it. For John Burns, the socialist London County 
Councillor, 451 is probably going to resign, along with the entire Battersea 
Branch,452 and may already have done so. He and Parnell (who signed 
our circular) have already been selected as delegates to the Possibilist 
congress and, while there, will be working for us. 
With the exception of the Social Democratic Federation, the 
Possibilists haven't got a single socialist organisation anywhere in 
Europe. Hence they are falling back on the nonsocialist Trades Unions 
and would do anything in the world to get hold of even the old Trades 
Unions, Broadhurst and Co., but the latter had their fill of that last 
November here in London.320 From America they'll be getting one 
Knight of Labor.60 
The point of all this—and the reason why I've thrown myself into it 
as I have done—is that what we are now witnessing is the re-enactment

of the old rift in the International, the old battle of the Hague.453  The 
antagonists are the same, save only that the anarchist flag has been 
exchanged for the Possibilist—principles sold to the bourgeoisie in 
return for concessions on minor points, more particularly in return for 
well-paid positions for the leaders (Municipal Council, Labour 
Exchange, etc.). And the tactics are identical. The manifesto of the Social 
Democratic Federation, which has clearly been written by Brousse, is a 
new version of the Sonvillier circular. 454 And Brousse knows it full well: 
He still uses the same lies and calumnies in attacking le Marxisme autori­
taire, and Hyndman apes him—his chief sources of information about 
the International and Marx's political activities being the malcontents of 
the General Council here, i.e. Eccarius, Jung and Co. 
The alliance between the Possibilists and the Social Democratic 
Federation was meant to constitute the nucleus of the new International 
which was to be founded in Paris—with the Germans as the third party in 
the alliance,a  provided they toed the line, otherwise in opposition to them. 
Hence the series of little congresses, each one larger than the last, hence the 
aloofness towards all other French and English tendencies, which were 
treated as though nonexistent by the allies, and hence the clique-forming, 
notably with the small nations, which had also been the mainstay of 
Bakunin. But these goings-on were rudely interrupted when the Germans 
naively—and in absolute ignorance of what was happening elsewhere— 
also entered the congress stakes with their St Gallen resolution. 178 And 
since the fellows preferred to oppose rather than co-operate with the 
Germans—whom they regarded as altogether too Marxified—a struggle 
was inevitable. But you have no idea how naïve the Germans are. I had to 
go to immense pains to make even Bebel see what was really at stake, 
although the Possibilists are very well aware of, and constantly proclaim, 
it. And because of all these mistakes I had little hope that things would 
turn out well, that the immanent reason, which throughout this affair has 
gradually been gaining awareness of  itself,  would triumph so soon. I am 
all the more glad to receive proof that what happened in 1873 and 1874 is 
no longer possible today. 455 The intriguers have already been beaten, and 
the significance of the congress—whether or not it absorbs the other—lies 
in the fact that the concord of the socialist parties of Europe will be plain 
for all the world to see, while the handful of intriguers, should they refuse 
to toe the line, will be left out in the cold.

Otherwise the congress is of no great significance. I, of course, shall 
not attend it, being unable to throw myself into agitation again for any 
length of time. But if the chaps are intent on playing at congresses once 
more, it's better that these shouldn't be directed by Brousse and 
Hyndman. For it is high time a spoke was put in their wheel. 
I am curious to see what effect Bernstein's No. II will have.450 Let's 
hope it will be the concluding document in this affair.

Congress. But I am afraid I shall have as yet to delay accepting it. There 
are two things which I avoid visiting on principle, and only go to on 
compulsion: congresses and exhibitions. The din and throng of your 
'world's fair',a to speak the slang of the respectable Britisher, is anything 
but an attraction for me, and from the Congress I must keep away in any 
case;  that would launch me in a new agitation campaign, and I should 
come back here with a load of tasks, for the benefit of a variety of nation­
alities, that would keep me busy for a couple of years. Those things one 
cannot decline at a congress, and yet I must, if the 3rd volumeb  is to see 
the light of day. For more than 3 months I have not been able to look at 
it, and it is too late now to begin before the holidays I intend taking; nor 
am I sure that my congress troubles are quite over. So if I do not come 
over to Le Perreux this year, aufgeschoben ist nicht sufgehobene but this 
summer I shall take a little rest in a quiet seaside place and try to put 
myself in condition again to be able to smoke a cigar which I have not 
done for more than two months, about a gramme of tobacco every other 
day being as much as I can stand—but I sleep again, and a moderate 
drink does no longer affect me unpleasantly. 
Here is a bit of news for Paul; Sam Moore gives us tonight a parting 
dinner, he sails on Saturday for the Niger, where, at Asâba, in the interior 
of Africa, he will be Chief Justice of the Territories of the Royal Niger 
Company, Chartered and Limited, with six months' leave to Europe 
every other year, good pay, and the expectation of returning in 8 years or 
so an independent man. It was chiefly in honour of Paul d that he 
consented to become Lord Chief Justice of the Niger Niggers, the very 
cream of Nigritione Niger Niggerdom. We are all very sorry to lose him, 
but he has been looking out for some thing of the sort for more than a 
year and this is an excellent place. He owes his appointment not only to 
his legal qualifications, but very much, also, to his being an accomplished 
geologist and botanist and ex-volunteer officer—all qualities very valu­
able in a new country. He will have a botanical garden, and make a mete­
orological station; his judicial duties will mainly consist in punishing 
German smugglers of Bismarck's potato spirit and of arms and ammuni­
tion. The climate is far better than its reputation, and his medical exami­
nation was highly satisfactory, the doctor telling him he would have a 
better chance than young men who kill themselves—out of pure

ennui—with whisky and black harems. Thus when the 3rd volume comes 
out, a portion, at least, of it will be translated in Africa as I shall send him 
the advance sheets. 
To return to our beloved congress. I consider these congresses to be 
unavoidable evils in the movement; people will insist on playing at 
congresses, and though they have their useful demonstrative side, and do 
good in bringing people of different countries together, it is doubtful 
whether le jeu vaut la chandelle* when there are serious differences. But 
the persistent efforts of the Possibilists and Hyndmanites to sneak into the 
leadership of a new International, by means of their congresses, made a 
struggle unavoidable for us, and here is the only point in which I agree 
with Brousse: that it is the old split in the International over again, which 
now drives people into two opposite camps. On one side the disciples of 
Bakunin, with a different flag but with all the old equipment and tactics, a 
set of intriguers and humbugs who try to 'boss' the working class move­
ment for their own private ends; on the other side the real working-class 
movement. And it was this, and this alone that made me take the matter 
up in such good earnest. Debates about details of legislation do not inter­
est me to such a degree. But the position reconquered upon the Anarchists 
after 1873 455 was now attacked by their successors, and so I had no choice. 
Now we have been victorious, we have proved to the world that almost all 
Socialists in Europe are 'Marxists' (they will be mad they gave us that 
name!) and they are left alone in the cold with Hyndman to console them. 
And now I hope my services are no longer required. 
As they have nobody to come to them, they fall back upon non-
Socialist or half-Socialist Trades Unions and thus their  congress  will have 
a quite distinct character from ours. That makes the question of fusion a 
secondary one; two such congresses may sit side by side, without scan­
dal. 
My dear Laura, I was going to write a lot more, but I cannot see 
hardly, it is so foggy, and thus I had to interrupt for brighter intervals, 
until now it is post-time. So I can but enclose the cheque £10.—about 
which Paul writes. 
As to money for Congress, the Germans ought to do something—if I 
can, will write to Paul about that tomorrow.b

ENGELS TO CONRAD SCHMIDT 
IN BERLIN 
London, 12 June 1889 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Sir, 
A thousand apologies for having been so thoroughly remiss in 
answering the inquiry in your esteemed letter of 15 April.456 Contrary 
to my intentions I have got involved in the debate over the international 
congress and have thus taken upon myself a great deal of work, corre­
spondence, running about, etc., which unfortunately has meant my 
neglecting a mass of other things, among them many letters, which 
remain unanswered. 
So as not to keep you waiting a moment longer, I must inform you 
that I have not seen the pamphlet in questiona  since the time it appeared 
in Cologne, nor, to my knowledge, is there a copy among Marx's papers. 
The pamphlet came out shortly before the trial began and I have never 
heard of a second part. Something of that kind would probably have 
been advertised in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung but all I can find there is 
the announcement, which first appeared on 9 July 1848, of this one 
pamphlet, described as Part I; the proceedings began on 5 August. There 
are no advertisements for a second part in the intervening numbers and 
I feel sure it never appeared. After his acquittal Lassalle would have had 
no cause to continue with a critique whose sole purpose had been to 
secure that acquittal. 193

I am most anxious to see that piece of yours,3  which has found a berth 
at last. I shan't be able to read the article on Kant in the Vossische until 
after the post has gone, so for the present I can do no more than say how 
very grateful I am to you for sending it. 
If you join the Vossische and are required to belabour the East, the 
Standard is the only paper I would commend to your attention. Of all 
the London and, possibly, European, papers (a few in Hungary 
excepted), none is better informed on the East in so far as Russia's inter­
ests are concerned. A day or two ago, for example, it was first with the 
news of Russia's little scheme, which has now re-emerged into the light 
of day, for a greater Serbian empire under the Prince of Montenegro—a 
little scheme whose furtherance has, for the present, been entrusted by 
the Russian government to the pan-Slav Comité so that, depending on 
circumstances, the former can either itself pursue it, or shelve it again for 
a while; 2., with the news of the secret agreement between Tsar b and 
Shahc whereby Persia would not grant railway, shipping, etc., conces­
sions without Russia's approval and, in case of war, would place 
Khorassan at the Russians' disposal (i.e. make possible their strategic 
encirclement of Afghanistan). Months often go by without anything of 
this kind appearing in the Standard, but then the disclosures usually 
come thick and fast. The Standard is supplied with the stuff by 
Russophobes in the Conservative Party, the army and the Indian Civil 
Service. 
I fear that, once Russia has fixed up the conversion of her debt424 and 
acquired thereby a financial status she has never enjoyed before, the pan-
Slav party on the one hand and, on the other, the need to provide 
employment for the army (whose younger, educated officers are without 
exception constitutionalists,457 hence far in advance of the Prussians), 
thus keeping its mind off political conspiracies, will precipitate the 
Russian government into war. What will happen then, no one can tell; 
the old oracle of Delphi comes to mind: Croesus by crossing the Halys 
will ruin a mighty realm. 
In any event much will be destroyed in the process, including, 
perhaps, the German army, provided a certain conceited young rascald is 
given a bit of time to disorganise it. 
Meanwhile there has also been the splendid business of the coalminers'

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 15 June 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
I have written and told Bebel458  that your contributions are coming in 
rather slowly, and that you are hard put to it to obtain adequate funds 
for the congress, etc. I explained to him the reasons (your numerical 
weakness in Paris, the necessity for the provincials to scrape up their 
funds for their delegations, the habitual sluggishness of the French in 
paying contributions, etc.) and I suggested that here was an opportunity 
for the German Party to make a grant as a good international invest­
ment. You would be well-advised to ginger up Liebknecht with a view 
to obtaining the said grant since you would be better able than I to put 
your case to him, at the same time mentioning that you have written to 
him on the subject at my instance. 
I am sending you Justice, containing Hyndman's reply.459 It is an 
outburst of impotent rage from a man aware that he has been well and 
truly trounced. What he says about Parnell and Stepniak is an out-and-
out lie. I have before me a letter from Stepniak, sent to Tussy yesterday 
just after he had  seta.  Justice, in which he says it is false and that he will 
be writing to Justice without delay.460 As for Parnell, his name was given

to us officially by the LABOUR ELECTORAL ASSOCIATION448 
and, so long as he has not divested himself of his functions as secretary 
to that Association, he cannot contest the validity of his signature.3 He 
had refused to sign as  a private person and we had respected his scruples 
on that score. 
No one knows who this Field is—the chap who has evinced such 
ardour in defending our congress.461 
The Danish paper run by Trier and Petersenb has come out publicly 
in our favour, but they are right not to have gone further than this. 
Should they propose sending a delegation to our congress, they would 
impel the official Danish Party into the arms of the Possibilists. We have 
the satisfaction of knowing that these cryptic-Possibilists will not dare 
go to the other congress. 
Since the nature of the two congresses is now quite distinct—ours 
consisting of all the Socialists combined, the other of men who stop 
short at Trades Unionism (it'll get nothing more, except for the 
Possibilists and the Social Democratic Federation), it is beginning to 
seem unlikely that there will be a merger, and if there is none there will 
be no disgrace. For it is a matter of common knowledge that Socialism 
has, as yet, failed to unite under its banner the whole of Europe's work­
ing class—knowledge which the existence of two parallel congresses 
would merely go to confirm. 
On the other hand, our congress being now more progressive than 
the other, we now have different responsibilities. If the two congresses 
were both avowedly Socialist, we could avoid a rumpus by making 
sundry concessions of a formal nature. But now that the forces have 
been mustered, without intervention by us, in two different camps and 
under two different banners, it behoves us to safeguard the honour of 
the Socialist banner, while the merger—if it happens—will be not so 
much a merger as an alliance. Hence it is a matter of thoroughly thrash­
ing out the terms of that alliance. 
Whatever the case, we must wait and see how things go, and not tie 
ourselves down beforehand by making irrevocable decisions. The real 
aim must always be to put one's adversary in the wrong and so to 
arrange things that, in the event of a breach, it is he who will take the 
blame. 
You may be sure that, after what has happened, neither the Possibilists 
a See this volume, p.331 - b Arbeideren

Letters-1889 343 
nor the Social Democrat Federation will be animated by a desperate urge 
to effect a merger, but rather by an ardent desire to saddle us with the 
blame for the breach they secretly desire and which alone could give 
them some semblance of continued existence. To do them the kindness 
of provoking a breach would mean giving them a new lease of life. Only 
mistakes on our part would enable them to recover from their defeat, 
and those mistakes are going to be made by us if we let ourselves be 
swayed by passion or any kind of sentiment. It is a matter of pure calcu­
lation, nothing else.

344 Letters -1889 
As to this Congress of yours I see, from your letter to Maggie 
Harkness, that it is intended to keep the administrative sittings in 
private. Now I am fully convinced that this question can only be decided 
by the Congress  itself,  and after having heard the Germans, Austrians, 
etc. But as far as the order of the day questions are concerned, I do not 
see any necessity for insisting upon private meetings at all, and should 
think the Germans themselves would prefer public sittings all through— 
unless there is in some quarters a hankering after a restoration of the 
International in some form or other, and that the Germans would and 
ought to oppose with might and main. Our people and the Austrians are 
the only ones that have a real struggle to go through, real sacrifices to 
make, with always a hundred men or so in prison, and they cannot 
afford to play at international organisations which are at present as 
impossible as they are useless. 
On the other hand, the Possibilists and Co. will do everything to give 
retentissement 3- to their congress, will probably have no private meetings 
at all, after the vérification des  pouvoirs}'  and perhaps not even for that— 
and with the odds in their favour in their connection with the bourgeois 
press in France and here, they will get the pull of us—handicapped heav­
ily as we are—unless we act boldly and have the press admitted as often 
as ever possible. 
From all this, I conclude that it will be best not to have any settled 
opinion upon this or other questions connected with the Congress, but 
to wait until the others have been heard and then come to a conclusion. 
This I would apply also to what Paul writes about making the fusion of 
both congresses impossible.462 It strikes me that when that question 
crops up, there will be so many practical difficulties that, unless the 
Possibilists give way on every point, nothing is likely to come of it. But 
the Possibilists won't give way, and as they are sure to make up by 
Trades Unions what they lack in Socialists, and will have a pretty fair 
show of French and English (which two nations, as you know, make up, 
in their own opinion, the whole civilised world) and as they will have 
one Knight of Labour,60 representing, on his own statement, at least 
500,000, and one American Federationist of Labor,463 representing 
600,000, they will represent, on paper, an immense number of working 
men and expect us poor Socialists to give in. All I fear is that they may 
make a sham move to put us in the wrong before the public (a trick they

understand to a T) and that Liebknecht will fall into the trap. In that case 
I reckon upon you especially, upon Tussy and D. Nieuwenhuis to 
open Bebel's eyes and to prevent the success of Liebknecht's 
Vereinigungswut.* 
Tussy has replied to Paul's question about Lavy; I was not there, she 
knows all about it.464 
In my opinion the two congresses might sit side by side without any 
harm—they are essentially different in character, the one of Socialists 
and the other chiefly of aspirants to Socialism, and I do not think Bebel 
would under these circumstances be prepared to go in for union at any 
price. He wrote to me that the fusion could only take place on the foot­
ing of perfect equality, and that will no doubt be the minimum of his 
conditions. But he has never lived outside Germany, and is no judge of 
English or French conditions of life or ideas—and there Liebknecht may 
become dangerous, especially as he is unfortunately, for want of a better 
informed man, the foreign minister of the Germans. One point you must 
press upon Bebel is that the Possibilists and SDF intend using the 
Congress as a means of restoring the International, a thing the Germans 
cannot countenance without calling down upon themselves prosecutions 
innumerable; and that therefore the Germans had better keep away from 
such a congress.

enough at Paris without me. 
I suppose our people in Paris are preparing  a projet de règlement^ for 
the Congress? That is absolutely necessary to save time, and it should be 
very short and leave all details to the chairman.

lines from Madeira in a day or two.

quence of various unavoidable circumstances, and as the summer season 
is always a very idle time, I am afraid I shall not be able to do much at it 
before September or October. The section on Banks and Credit offers 
considerable difficulties. The leading principles are announced clearly 
enough, but the whole context is such that it presupposes the reader to 
be well acquainted with the chief works of literature on the subject such 
as Tookeb and Fullerton,c and as this is not the case generally, it will 
require a deal of explanatory notes, etc. 
By the way I have a second copy of Fullerton's Regulation of 
Currencies, the chief work on the question; if you have not got the book 
I shall be most happy if you will allow me to send it to you. 
The last section 'on rent of land' will, as far as I recollect, require but 
formal revision, so that, the Bank and Credit section once finished (it is 
1/3 of the whole), the last third (Rent, and the different classes of 
revenue) will not take long. But as this crowning volume is such a splen­
did and totally unanswerable work, I consider myself bound to bring it 
out in a shape in which the whole line of argument stands forth clearly 
and in bold  relief.  And with the state of this Ms.—a mere first sketch, 
often interrupted, and left incomplete—that is not so very easy. 
I am trying to make arrangements to have two competent gentlemend 
to copy out for me the elements of the fourth volume from the Ms. 
which my eyes will hardly allow me to dictate. If I succeed in this, I shall 
also have trained them to the deciphering of these manuscripts which at 
present are a sealed book to everyone except myself who am used to the 
handwriting and abbreviations, and thus the author'se other manuscripts 
will remain available, quite independent of my life and death. I expect 
that these arrangements too may be concluded this next autumn.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 5 July 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
I quite appreciate that a congress consisting of delegates from an asso­
ciation should hold private meetings for the discussion of matters that 
concern no one but its members and, indeed, this would as a rule be 
obligatory. But that a congress of working-class and Socialist delegates, 
convened in order to discuss general questions such as the 8 hours' day, 
legislation on female and child labour, the abolition of standing armies, 
etc.,—that such a congress should close its doors to the public and delib­
erate in camera, strikes me as unjustifiable. The presence or otherwise of 
the Parisian public is of little moment, although the interest your Party 
must take in the said congress should certainly suffice to ensure it some 
sort of audience. But even if the usual nincompoops were to be conspic­
uous by their absence, the public meetings would, I opine, be none the 
worse. What we need is some reaction from the press, and for that to 
happen, publicity is essential. The press can only write about those things 
to which it is admitted. And the evening meetings devoted to oratory, in 
which French is obligatory as the only language the public understands, 
will hold out few charms for delegates who cannot speak it. After a 
lengthy afternoon or morning session they will want to look round Paris

rather than listen to incomprehensible speeches. Not that this should 
prevent you from holding one or two evening meetings in a large hall, but 
to close the doors for fear of it's being said that the hall was half empty is 
to attach, I should say, an exaggerated importance to the Parisian public. 
The congress is being held for the benefit of the world at large, a fact 
which the absence or otherwise of a handful of Parisians does nothing to 
alter. You, who are for ever saying that the Possibilists carry no weight, 
and that it is you who represent the French proletariat, now tremble lest 
they may have a bigger audience than yourselves! 
For that matter, Bebel has writtena saying that, for them, there can be 
no question of closed meetings and that, so far as the Germans are 
concerned, publicity is the only guarantee against renewed accusations 
of being a secret society. In the face of that argument, lesser considera­
tions relating to the Parisian public and its possible abstention will prob­
ably have to go by the board. 
He further says that 60 German delegates will probably be coming. In 
Germany, enthusiasm seems to be boundless. 
The Social Democratic Federation is well and truly in the shit. And 
who do you think has come to the rescue? Poor H. Jung, who this week 
declares in a letter^ that our congress is of no consequence whatsoever, 
that it's a HAPPY FAMILY of enemies, that Longuet is not a Socialist, 
that Jaclard is not a Socialist, that Liebknecht voted for Bismarck's 
colonial policy (which is a lie), etc. Poor fellows, they are at their wits' 
end. 
You doubtless know that Ferdinand D. Nieuwenhuis is going to 
propose a merger 'in view of the fact that the agenda is the same for both 
congresses'. Since the agenda is not the same, I cannot see that anyone 
can vote for this motion. At all events I have written to Bebel,470 point­
ing out that things are no longer at the stage they had reached at the 
Hague385; that since that time you have been authorised by them to 
convene your congress; that this was supported by the whole of Socialist 
Europe and that, in consequence, you were entitled to lay down new 
conditions for a possible merger; that the mania for unity may force the 
unionists to adopt a course ultimately leading to union with their 
enemies and separation from their friends and allies; and, finally, that 
there will be a host of minor difficulties. Indeed, in my opinion, there

will not be the slightest chance of a useful merger unless detailed condi­
tions are hammered out between committees from both congresses, and 
are agreed by the latter. Otherwise the union will not last for more than 
a couple of hours. And if a solution is to be reached, time will be needed, 
which means that the merger, if it happens at all, could not be effected 
until things are nearly over. 
Your article went off to Russia yesterday, REGISTERED. 
What you tell me about the wine-growers of Champagne471 is 
extremely interesting—the ruination of the peasant is now gathering 
speed, thanks to advanced capitalism! 
It is most fortunate that Liebknecht should be staying with Vaillant; 
I have strong suspicions that he will make another attempt to join forces 
with the 'good elements' among the Possibilists, going 'over Brousse's 
head', as in March and April.

6th inst.472 has reassured me on that score. 
The harsh blow that fate has, I'm sure, quite undeservedly dealt you

As things are now, I certainly believe that your family is right about

Dear Sorge, 
Our congress is in session473  and proving a brilliant success. By the day 
before yesterday 358 delegates had arrived and more are on their way. 
About half are foreigners, 81 of them being Germans from all the larger 
and smaller states and provinces excepting only Posen. On the first day

whereupon a search was made for a third. The sessions, despite various 
objections on the part of the French (they thought that the Possibilists 
would attract larger audiences in Paris and that it would therefore be 
preferable to meet in camera), are all being held in public—the only safe­
guard against mouchards 3-—at the unanimous request of the Germans. 
All Europe is represented. The Sozialdemokrat will be informing 
America of the numbers by the next post. For the first time Scottish and 
German miners from the colliery districts are foregathering there for 
joint discussions. 474 
The Possibilists have 80 foreigners (42 British, of whom 15 are from 
the Social Democratic Federation and 17 from the Trades Unions), 7 
Austro-Hungarians (obviously little more than eyewash, this, since the 
whole of the genuine movement over there is on our side), 7 Spaniards, 
7 Italians (3 representing Italian societies abroad), 7 Belgians, 4 
Americans (2 of whom, Bowen and Georgei from Washington, DC,b 
visited me), 2 Portuguese, 1 Swiss {nommé par lui-même^), 1 Pole. 
Almost all of them are Trades Unionists. Besides these there are 477 
Frenchmen who, however, represent only 136 chambres syndicales^ 
and 77 cercles d'études socialistes^ since each little clique may send 3 
delegates, whereas each of our 180 Frenchmen represent one particular 
society. 
The eyewash with regards to fusion is, of course, much in evidence at 
both congresses; the foreigners want fusion, but in both cases the French 
are holding back. Fusion on rational terms is perfectly all right; the 
eyewash, however, consists in the clamour for fusion a toutprixj which 
some of our own people are raising. 
Have just seen in the Sozialdemokrat that Liebknecht's motion in 
favour of fusion has actually been carried by a large majority. What it 
consists in and whether it signifies genuine fusion based on private nego­
tiations or merely an abstract desire which might lead up to them is not, 
unfortunately, apparent from the report. The easy-going nature of the 
Germans is above such trifles, but the fact that the French have accepted 
it is sufficient guarantee, so far as I'm concerned, that no disgrace will be 
incurred vis-à-vis the Possibilists. I shan't know more until after the post 
has left, probably not until tomorrow.

In any case you'll no doubt hear the essentials as soon as I shall, for the 
Avelings have made arrangements regarding cabling with the New York 
Herald's man in Paris. Today I shall send you Saturday's Reynolds* and 
Monday's Star—which contain everything of any importance to have 
appeared in the press over here up till now. More on Saturday. 
At all events the intrigues resorted to by the Possibilists and the Social 
Democratic Federation in order that they might worm their way into the 
leading position in France and England respectively have proved a total 
failure and their pretensions to the international leadership still more so. 
If the two congresses, one alongside the other, merely fulfil the purpose 
of deploying their forces—Possibilists and London intriguers here, 
European socialists (who, thanks to the former, figure as Marxists), 
there—so that the world may see where the genuine movement is 
concentrated and where the bogus, that will be enough. Obviously any 
real fusion, supposing it came, would do nothing whatever to stop the 
squabbles continuing in England and France—quite the contrary. It 
would merely mean an imposing demonstration for the benefit of the 
great bourgeois public, a working men's congress more than 900 strong, 
ranging from representatives of the most docile Trades Unions to the 
most revolutionary communists. And it would put an end once and for 
all to the machinations of the intriguers at subsequent congresses, for 
they have now seen where the real power lies, they have seen that we are 
a match for them in France and their superiors throughout the 
Continent and that their position in England is also very precarious.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 343 
IN MOUNT DESERT 
London, 20 July 1889 
Dear Sorge, 
In my last letter I forgot to ask you if possible to question Hartmann 
about the article in the Evening News and Post. If you could get him to 
write a brief note in his own hand to the effect that the story is false and 
that he has not been to Europe, it would be important for us over 
here. 476 Because, 
1. Bismarck is trying to make the Tsara beholden to him by revealing 
alleged plots against his (the Tsar's) life. 
2. Hitherto these have been going on in Switzerland, but now that the 
Swiss have expelled all potential plotters, operations must be transferred 
to London. 
3. This end is being served by the mouchardh  Carl Theodor Reuss, 
who had already, on a previous occasion, used the Evening News as a 
repository for his lying allegations with regard to dynamite. 
4. This latest Reussiad was telegraphed from Berlin to all German 
newspapers. 
If we can expose this business outright, there'll be a nice rumpus over 
here. 
Yours of the 7th inst. received yesterday evening.477  I don't demand 
any particular satisfaction of Wischnewetzky for his failure to visit me.— 
It didn't grieve me. So if he eats humble pie vis-à-vis  yourself,  that will 
suit me. I did not call on his wife, 0 whereat she took umbrage, which was 
why he failed to visit me, so that makes us quits. If these people view the 
matter in a similar light, I shall be content. Obviously if they demand 
more, I shan't be able to oblige them. But as I have business matters to 
settle with his wife, it's always best to be at least on speaking terms; I'll be 
in no hurry to let them revert to anything more intimate, now that I 
know as much about them as you do. They're a couple of conceited fools.

that the Possibilists and the Social Democratic Federation, having rightly 
understood their position, should have preferred to deal our people a kick, 
thereby bringing the silly business to an end. That the thing had been 
prepared de longue main* is evident from the whole series of now compre­
hensible manoeuvres and utterances on the part of these gentry over the 
past 2 months. It is the old Bakuninist libel against the Hague Congress, 453 
etc., to the effect that we had always operated with false credentials.478 
This libel, which Brousse has been raking up off and on ever since 1883, 
was bound to come to the fore again on the present occasion, once they 
saw that they had been abandoned by all the socialists and that they could 
only save themselves with the help of the Trades Unions. The nature of 
their credentials will doubtless be revealed in the course of the furious 
polemic that is now flaring up. Unfortunately this old rubbish cuts no 
more ice today than it did back in  1873 455; but something had to be found 
to cover up the fact that they have been utterly disgraced. However it's 
just as well that our sentimental brethren, the advocates of reconciliation, 
received a savage kick on the backside in return for all their assurances of 
friendship. That will doubtless cure them for some time to come. 
I shan't be able to send you any more papers until the next post (week­
lies which Aveling writes for but which won't come out until this evening 
and tomorrow); I have not had a single letter from Paris since Tuesday. 
As regards Lingenau,479  congratulations on the sum extracted. 
Liebknecht alone was at fault here; Bebel is methodical and precise in 
such matters. No doubt Mount Desert will do you good; I too shall 
make for the water before long.

My dear friend Martignetti, 
All I can say in reply to your letter of the 14th inst. is that my funds 
are only limited and, furthermore, that there are calls on them from a 
great many quarters. Hence, if your Buenos Aires plan goes ahead, I 
cannot possibly assume the responsibility of guaranteeing your liveli­
hood until such time as you are able to lay the foundations of a new 
livelihood  yourself.  I will tell you quite candidly what more I can do. I 
can place another five pounds sterling at your disposal and, should 
something very important be at stake, shall try and send you another 
five, i.e. ten pounds in all. That, however, would in fact exhaust my 
funds for a long time to come and render it impossible for me to do 
anything further for you. 
I hope you will be justly treated by the court of appeal and remain

Dear Citizen, 
I have just received a letter from Brocher 480 enclosing the one you had 
written him and asking me on your behalf for a loan of  £20.  As I am not 
used to reading Russian handwriting, I was not really able to decipher 
enough of your letter to find out exactly what is involved. But however 
that may be I have to tell you with infinite regret that it is out of the 
question for me to advance the sum for which you ask. My expenditure 
has of late been quite extraordinary as a result of my having to help 
numerous personal and political friends and then, to compound matters, 
there has been the congress, 473 which has necessitated my making further 
advances of all kinds, so that I am now completely cleaned out. Having 
been asked by Brocher to let you have an immediate reply, I am losing 
no time in so doing, and am sorry that I am not able to give you a more 
favourable answer.

4, Cavendish Place 
Dear Sorge, 
Letters of 1 August received.481 So we are both taking a summer holi­
day—a summer of which the main feature over here is plenty of nice 
fresh rain. 
I can't send any papers, since these are forwarded to me only at very 
irregular intervals from London. Just the Labour Elector, a paper which 
is now assuming some importance. It was started by Champion in oppo­
sition to Hyndman, but kept afloat with suspect funds (from a Liberal-
Unionist quarter482), and hence was egregiously pro-Tory and inanely 
anti-Irish, so that one had to be very wary of it; but because it was 
suspect and already so notoriously Tory-Socialist483  people stopped 
buying the thing. This, however, brought about a revolution. The Tory 
funds would seem to have run out and thus Champion— au fond 3 a no 
less unreliable bloke than Hyndman—found himself forced to do some­
thing he had long resisted, namely accept the terms offered by a commit­
tee—Burns, Bateman (typographer), Mann (engineer), Cunninghame-
Graham—whereby the said committee became proprietor of the paper 
and Champion its temporary editor. The names of the committee 
members are a guarantee that all association with other parties and their 
funds has been broken off, and the paper, which is clearly on the up and 
up, is said to be almost paying its way. The Tory and anti-Irish nonsense 
has ceased, while the paper has done us yeoman service in the matter of 
the congress. 473 
The plan of Hyndman and Co's gang was to cast doubt on the creden­
tials—which they alleged to be false—of the Marxist congress. Hence 
their unacceptable terms for fusion. The same old Bakuninist tactics as of 
yore,  but specially adapted for English consumption. That it wouldn't

be much of a catch on the Continent was plain, but all one to them; 
provided it caught on here in England, their position would, for a time, 
be secure—and here all the odds were in their favour. But our vigorous 
offensive brought the business to an abrupt conclusion—Burns' arti-
clea and mineb (on the Austrian credentials) in the Labour Elector have, 
I think, robbed them of all desire to cast doubt on other people's 
credentials, an activity in which the Possibilists themselves have 
recently indulged to such good purpose as to leave small scope for 
anyone else. 
There is now some prospect that a viable socialist organisation may 
be formed here which will gradually undermine the Social Democratic 
Federation62 or else absorb it. Nothing can be done with the League;21 
they're just a bunch of anarchists and Morris is their lay figure. The idea 
is to agitate for an eight hour day among the democratic and radical 
clubs22—our recruiting grounds here—and the Trades Unions, and to 
organise the May the First 1890 demonstration. Since the latter was 
decided upon at our congress, the Social Democratic Federation must 
either adhere to it—i.e. submit to our resolutions—or oppose it and thus 
commit suicide. As you can see from the Labour Elector, the movement 
is at last taking hold amongst the Trades Unions484, and the star of 
Broadhurst, Shipton and Co. would seem to be rapidly on the wane. By 
next spring we shall, I believe, have made considerable progress. 
Russian jiggery-pokery continues amain. First the Armenian atroci­
ties, followed by others on the Serbian border. Next, for the benefit of 
the Serbs, magic lantern slides of the Greater Serbian Empire, and hints 
about the necessity of a Serbian military convention with Russia. And 
now the Cretan fracas which began, strangely enough, with internecine 
carnage among the Cretan Christians, until the Russian consul contrived 
to get them to sink their differences and massacre the Turks. And the 
stupid Turkish government goes and sends Shakir Pasha to Crete, a man 
who spent 8 years as Turkish ambassador to Petersburg and, while there, 
was bought by the Russians! The whole of this Cretan affair was 
intended, amongst other things, to prevent the British concluding an 
alliance with the Prussians.485 That is why it was launched when William 
came over here0—so that Gladstone could return to his hobby of phil-

hellenism and the liberals wax enthusiastic about the Cretan sheep steal­
ers. Little Willie wanted to be 'one up' on the Russians, wangle Crete for 
the Greeks as a dowry for his sister1 and, by the magic of his presence, 
induce the Sultanb to abdicate. But once again the Russians have shown 
him that, by comparison with them, he is but a babe in arms. If Greece 
gets Crete, it will be by the grace of Russia. 
Thanks for the news about Hartmann. I'd very much like to have 
further details as I want to put paid to this Prussian pack of lies in the

It's very sensible of your sonc to want to find a post. I only wish my

Dear Liebknecht, 
I have put off answering your letter of 19.4 until after the congress 
because there seemed to be no prospect of agreement beforehand; the fact 
is that our ways were utterly divergent. And even now I shall make no 
mention of your attempts to foist your sins of omission on to other people. 
You say: 'Your complaint that, even in the matter of the congress, I 
was "as usual" prevented by "unforeseen circumstances" from carrying 
out my duty, is more than merely blunt; it is downright insulting.' 
You can only make an insult of my words if you distort their meaning, 
turning something passive—that it is the usual thing for such and such to 
happen to you,—into something active—that you deliberately make a 
habit of such and such. You thereby turn a complaint of weakness into a 
complaint of wilfulness and there you have your insult ready-made. 
But you must yourself by now have noticed that you very often 
happen not to be at home when someone wants to keep you to your 
word or to make a quite common or garden request. What about the 
Aveling business in America?3 At the beginning, while the turpitude of 
the New York Executive was still fresh in your mind, you wrote: 
'The New Yorkers owe Aveling an apology; I shall demand one of 
them and, if they dig their heels in, shall come out publicly against them.' 
But later on, when it came to doing as you had said, it was a different 
matter: You sent a statement that was neither one thing nor the other, and 
did Aveling no good and the New Yorkers no harm,—unforeseen 
circumstances! And it was only gentle pressure from me that induced you 
to make a statement containing at least part of what you had promised. 
Even in your letter of 19.4. you can't help providing fresh  proof. 
Under the aegis of your name as editor, your son-in-law* brings out a 
series of books. You, knowing what he's like, entrust him with the selec­
tion, the editing—in short, the entire management of the thing. The

inevitable happens. There appears, under your name, a trashy work by a 
more than dubious scoundrel, a really vile concoction in which the said 
ignorant scoundrel presumes to improve on Marx.400 This vile concoction 
is recommended to German working men as instructive reading along 
party lines by the appearance on the title page of your name as editor. That 
such a vile concoction should be published somewhere or other is, of 
course, a matter of complete indifference, nor would it be worthy of 
mention. But that it should be published by you, under your sponsorship, 
as having been sanctioned and recommended by you (for what else does the 
appearance of your name on it signify?)—that is what's intolerable. Of 
course your son-in-law pulled the wool over your eyes—you'd never have 
done it deliberately. But now, when it's your bounden duty to rid yourself 
of the said vile concoction, to declare that you have been scandalously 
imposed upon and that not so much as one more sheet of it will appear 
under your name—what happens? You devote an entire page of your letter 
to the unforeseen circumstances that prevent you from doing so. 
Why then the moral indignation over my having for once called this 
habit of yours by its proper name? Anyhow, I'm not the only person to 
have remarked on it. And if anyone has been insulted on this occasion it 
is I rather than you. 
If you have taken any further steps in the Schlesinger affair, I for one 
have heard nothing of it. But one thing I do know: if you put a stop to the 
publication of Schlesingers vile concoction, I shall be able to let the matter 
rest at that. But should a sequel or conclusion appear under your name I 
shall owe it to Marx to make a public protest. I trust you will not let things 
go as far as that, for I feel sure that this changeling that has been foisted 
onto you is altogether more than you can stomach. And as, no doubt, you 
yourself realise, Mr Geiser cannot be allowed to sell for a mess of potage 
the position you have attained in the party, the fruit of forty years' labour. 
I have been here a fortnight and shall probably stay on through the 
first week in September—in the same house I was in when you left for 
America.486 
Warm regards,

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 487 
IN LONDON 
Eastbourne, 22 August 1889 
4 Cavendish Place 
Dear Ede, 
Who is Paul Fischer? He wishes to translate my old article in 
Progress 4*9 for the Berliner Volks-Tribüne. Since I should have to do 
some notes for it and thus appear as an actual contributor to the Volks-
Tribüne, I have my reservations which, having sent a non committal 
answer, I shall keep in abeyance until my return. 
In your next numbera you ought to deal with the dock labourers' 
strike.489 The matter is one of crucial importance so far as this country is 
concerned. Hitherto the East End had been in a state of poverty-stricken 
stagnation, its hallmark being the apathy of men whose spirit had been 
broken by hunger, and who had abandoned all hope. Anyone who 
found himself there was lost, physically and morally. Then, last year, 
there came the victorious strike of the match-girls.490  And now, this 
gigantic strike of the most demoralised elements of the lot, the dock 
labourers, not the regular, strong, experienced, relatively well-paid men 
in steady employment, but those who have happened to land up in dock­
land, the Jonahs who have suffered shipwreck in all other spheres, 
starvelings by trade, a welter of broken lives heading straight for utter 
ruin and for whom Dante's words, 'lasciate ogni speranza, voi che' 
entrate' h might be written up on the dock gates! 
And this dully despairing mass of humanity who, every morning 
when the dock gates are opened, literally fight pitched battles to be first 
to reach the chap who signs them on—literal battles in the competitive 
struggle of the redundant workers amongst themselves—that mass, 
haphazardly thrown together and changing every day, has successfully 
combined to form a band 40,000 strong, maintain discipline and inspire 
fear in the powerful dock companies. It is something I am glad that I 
have lived to see. For this stratum to be capable of organisation is a fact 
a of Der Sozialdemokrat - b 'Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.' Dante, 
Inferno, III, 9 

=====第376页=====
Letters -1889 365 
of great significance. Whatever the outcome of the strike may be—and 
I'm never sanguine about such matters before the event—it means that, 
with the dockers, the lowest stratum of East End working men has 
entered the movement and that the higher strata are bound to follow 
suit. The East End has a greater number of ordinary labourers, those 
whose work requires little or no skill, than anywhere else in England. 
The organisation of these strata of the London proletariat, hitherto 
treated with contempt by the Trades Unions of skilled working men, 
will set an example for the provinces. 
And there's more to it than that. Because of the lack of organisation 
and the passively vegetable existence of the real East End workers, the 
lumpen proletariat has hitherto had last say there, purporting, and 
indeed being  held,  to be the prototype and representative of the million 
starvelings in the East End. That will now cease. The hawker and his ilk 
will be pushed into the background, the East End working men will be 
able to develop a prototype of their own and so organise themselves as 
to assert it, and this will be of enormous value to the movement. Scenes 
such as took place during Hyndman's procession along Pall Mall and 
Piccadilly491 will no longer be possible; a ne'er-do-well who tried to go 
on the rampage would simply be put down. 
In short, it is an event. And just look how even the abject Daily News 
is covering the affair!3 That alone shows what a tremendous impact it has 
made. It's just like the miners' strike at home435—a new stratum is 
coming into the movement, a new army corps. And your bourgeois 
who,  only 5 years ago, would have been cursing and fuming, now finds 
himself forced to applaud half-heartedly just when, and precisely 
because, his bowels have turned to water. Hurrah! 
What you said about parliamentarianism and its decline in your arti­
cle on the anarchistsb is absolutely right. I was delighted. 
Here it's so-so—changeable weather—am again somewhat lame as a 
result of too much walking, and hence teetotal, whatever Julius0 may 
say—but I'm not allowed tea in the evenings because of my nerves, and 
therefore I do take a glass of beer instead—on teetotal grounds!

Dear Hermann, 
The statement of account received with thanks; no doubt it will be 
correct. 
Would you be so kind as to forward the enclosed note to young or 
now, I suppose, old Caspar"—I don't know whether he lives in Krefeld 
or Barmen. As I learn from R. Blank, whom I ran into here a week ago, 
things aren't going too well with those chaps; if so, I am sorry. 
I have been here a fortnight but am, alas, having more rain than I can 
do with. Ever since the English have begun holding their naval manoeu­
vres in August, the weather during that month has been truly atrocious 
and yesterday the words of the old song came true here: 
On 21 August, just gone by, 
In storm and rain there came a spy, 
Who tidings to the prince did give, etc.492 
In consequence of which three big warships sailed past this morning, but 
we still await the famous naval battle which is to take place in the 
Channel, before our very eyes.

I shall probably be staying here another fortnight or three weeks, if 
the rain isn't too bad, for 
'Back to my home I cannot go', 
the place being full of whitewashers, paperers, painters and other work­
men, who make three-quarters of the rooms uninhabitable and, once 
they're in the house, you never know when you'll be rid of them again. 
This is because in England large-scale industry has ruined the crafts but 
has not been able to find anything else to put in their place. For a long 
time now the Germans have not had the sole prerogative of providing 
shoddy wares in return for good money; the Londoners have a positively 
stunning aptitude for this. In America, however, it's altogether different. 
So far as ordinary, everyday business dealings are concerned, in which no 
speculation is involved, America is, I believe, the most reliable country in 
the world—the only one in which you will still find 'good workmanship'. 
I trust you are all well. Much love to Emmaa  and to the children and 
grandchildren, as well as to the rest of the Engels-kirchen, from

AT LE PERREUX 
Eastbourne, 27 August 1889

My dear Laura, 
That letter-writing at the sea-side is well nigh an impossibility, I 
thought you knew long since. And if, as in my case, a lot of people 
* Emma Engels

whom I never saw seem to have conspired to overwhelm me with letters, 
visits,  inquiries, requests of all sorts, the impossibility becomes a 
complete fact. Austrian student-clubs, a Viennese inquirer after 'truth' 
who wishes to know had he not better devour Hegel (better not, I 
replied), a Romanian socialist in propria persona, an unknown man from 
Berlin now in London, etc, etc., all have come down at once upon me 
and all expect to be attended to at once. So, with six people around me 
in the room whither they are but too often driven by rain, nothing 
remains for me but to retire from time to time to my bedroom and to 
turn that into my 'office'. 
You had your adventures with Séraphine, Nim had hers with Ellen. 
Which Ellen having been long suspected by the knowing ones was one 
morning reported by the doctor to be six months gone in the way all 
flesh comes into the world and had consequently to leave—about a 
month before we came here. When we return there will be fresh engage­
ment of someone—perhaps worse. 
I am glad Paul is off on his election trip465 and moreover with funds 
from his Mamma." Of the three put up for Marseilles, one, perhaps two, 
may get in; I hope Paul may be one. But anyhow it is a distinct step in 
advance to have once been put up as candidate for the party, and facili­
tates further moves; especially with a rising party as ours at this moment 
undoubtedly is in France, once a candidate generally means always a 
candidate. 
I do hope Boulangism will come to grief next elections. Nothing 
worse could happen to us than even a succès d'estime of that humbug 
which might prolong, at least, the apparent dilemma: either Boulanger or 
Ferry—a dilemma which alone gives vitality to either scoundrel. If 
Boulanger got well thrashed, and his following reduced, more or less, to 
the Bonapartists, it would prove that this Bonapartist vein in the French 
character—explicable by the inheritance from the great Revolution—is 
gradually dying out. And with the elimination of this incident the regu­
lar development of French republican evolution would reprendre son 
course the Radicals 200 would, in their new incarnation Millerand, grad­
ually discredit themselves as much as in the incarnation Clemenceau, and 
the better elements among them pass over to us; the Opportunists 199 
would lose their last pretext for political existence, that of being at least 
defenders of the republic against pretenders; the liberties conquered by 
"Anna Virginia Armaignac - b resume its course 

=====第380页=====
Letters -1889 369 
the Socialists would not only be maintained but gradually extended, so 
that our party would be in a better position for fighting its way than 
anywhere else on the Continent; and the greatest danger in war would 
be removed. To believe as the Boulangeo-Blanquists494  do that by 
sustaining Boulanger they can get a few seats in Parliament is worthy of 
these ignorant purs 3- who would burn down a village in order to fry a 
côtelette. It is to be hoped that this experience will do Vaillant good. He 
knows perfectly what sort of fellows the mass of those Blanquists are, 
and his delusions as to the work to be got out of such materials must 
have received a severe shock. 
Hyndman's campaign with regard to the discredit to be thrown on 
the Marxist credentials478 seems to have utterly broken down. Burns' 
disclosuresb were a ready blow, and our further revelations, especially 
about the Austrian Possibilist credentials,0  did the rest. These people 
never know what a glass-house they are living in themselves. And as in 
France the Possibilists seem to have kept quiet with regard to that point 
(these fellows are far cleverer than Hyndman and Co—in their small 
way) there will be no further necessity to follow up the victory unless 
fresh attempts are made. The whole trick was calculated for the British 
market, and there it has failed— cela suffit.^ Then there is the resolution 
about the 1st of May demonstration. That is the best thing our Congress 
did. That will tell immensely here in England, and the Hyndman lot dare 
not oppose it; if they do, they ruin themselves; if they don't, they must 
follow in our wake; let them choose. 
Another great fact is the Dock Labourers strike.489  They are as you 
know the most miserable of all the misérables* 95 of the East End, the 
broken down ones of all trades, the lowest stratum above the 
Lumpenproletariat. That these poor famished broken-down creatures 
who bodily fight amongst each other every morning for admission to 
work, should organise for resistance, turn out 40-50,000 strong, draw 
after them into the strike all and every trade of the East End in any way 
connected with shipping, hold out above a week, and terrify the wealthy 
and powerful Dock Companies—that is a revival I am proud erlebt zu 
haben? And they have even bourgeois opinion on their side: the

blame the workmen, but the obstinate Dock Companies. So that if they 
hold out another week they are almost sure of victory. 
And all this strike is worked and led by our people, by Burns and 
Mann, and the Hyndmanites are nowhere in it. 
My dear Laura, I am almost sure you are in want of some cash and I 
should have sent a cheque with this if I was not myself hard up. My 
balance at the bank is at the lowest ebb; a dividend of some £33, due 
generally about 18th August, has not yet been paid and Edward has 
borrowed £15 till end of month, as he was quite fast. So I have hardly 
room to turn round in, but as soon as I receive a supply I shall remit; at 
latest next Monday, I hope before. 
Domelaa  becomes quite incomprehensible. Is he perhaps after all not 
Jesus Christ, but Jan van Leiden?  la prophète de Meyerbeer} Vegetarianism 
and solitary confinement seem apt to produce queer results in the long run.

cheque for £30, ten of which are the second half of the money I 
promised Paul for his electioneering expenses and for which he applied 
in a letter, to hand here last Friday, from Cette. His prospects in the 
town seem good but then Cette is but small and the country votes will 
decide—hope I shall hear more from him in a few days. Let's hope for 
the best. 
Cannot write much being Sunday and our people always in and out, 
moreover have to write to Tussy about the strike489 which was in an 
important crisis yesterday. As the dock directors kept stubborn, our 
people were led to a very foolish resolution. They had outstripped their 
means of relief and had to announce that on Saturday no relief could be 
dealt out to strikers. In order to make this go down—that is the way at 
least I take it—they declared that if the dock directors had not caved in by 
Saturday noon, on Monday there would be a general strike—reckoning 
chiefly on the supposition that the Gas works for want of coal or of work­
men or both would come to a stand and London be in darkness—and this 
threat was to terrify all into submission to the demands of the men. 
Now this was playing va banque, staking £1000 to win, possibly, £10; 
it was threatening more than they could carry out; it was creating 
millions of hungry mouths for no reason but because they had some tens 
of thousands on hand which they could not feed; it was casting away 
wilfully all the sympathies of the shopkeepers and even of the great mass 
of the bourgeoisie who all hated the dock monopolists, but who now 
would at once turn against the workmen; in fact it was such a declaration 
of despair and such a desperate game that I wrote to Tussy at once: 406 if 
this is persisted in, the Dock Companies have only to hold out till 
Wednesday and they will be victorious. 
Fortunately they have thought better of it. Not only has the threat 
been 'provisionally' withdrawn, but they have even acceded to the 
demands of the wharfingers (in some respect competitors of the docks), 
have reduced their demands for an increase of wages, and this has again 
been rejected by the Dock Companies. This I think will secure them the 
victory. The threat with the general strike will now have a salutary effect, 
and the generosity of the workmen, both in withdrawing it and in acced­
ing to a compromise, will secure them fresh sympathy and help. 
On Friday* we shall return to London. Shorlemmer has left about a 
fortnight ago for Germany, where he is now, what he is doing and what 
his intentions are, I don't know.

As to Boulanger his weakness is shown in his electoral proceedings: 
he takes Paris and leaves to the monarchists all the provinces. That 
ought to disabuse his most obstinate adherents if they pretend to be 
Republicans. Paul writes to me that a Marseilles Boulangist has owned 
to him that Boulanger has had from the Russian government 15 
millions. That explains the whole dodge. The Russian dynasty, now 
allied by Denmark to the Orléans, 496 wishes for an Orléans restauration 
and one brought about by Russia; for then the Orléans would be its 
slaves. And only with a monarchical France can the Czar a have a sincere 
alliance, such as he requires for a long war with dubious chances. To 
bring this about, Boulanger is put forward as the tool. If he is success­
ful as a stepping stone to monarchy, he will, at the proper time, be 
bought off or in case of need put out of the way, for the Russian govern­
ment will not have in that case the scruples which our Socialists have; 
'denn die abzumurksen ist uns Wurscht'^ is their motto. As to Millerand 
I believe you are right. In his paper c there is, for all its attempted radi­
calism, a tone of weakness, half-despondency, and above all so much of 
the milk of human kindnessd  (stale as it is, it has not the stuff in it to 
turn sour) that compared even with La Justice as I have once known 
that paper, it inspires pity mingled with a drop of contempt. And these 
be the successors of the old French Republicans,  les fils des héros de la

AT LE PERREUX 
London, 9 September 1889 
My dear Laura, 
Today I have the pleasant task of remitting you cheque for £14.6.8, 
one-third share of Meissner 's Remittance of £43,—the account is to 
follow. A fourth edition of Vol. I a 497 is impending, maybe before New 
Year we shall begin printing it. 
Tussy was here yesterday with Liebknecht, his son and daughter 
Gertrud, Singer, Bernstein, Fischer, etc. etc. She is still over head and ears 
in the strike. 489 The Lord Mayor's,13 Cardinal Manning's and Bishop of 
London's0 proposals were ridiculously in favour of the Dock Companies 
and had never a chance of acceptance. This is the busiest time; from 
Christmas to April nearly no work is done at the docks, so that the real 
purport of delaying the advance to January would have been to delay it 
till April. 
You will have Liebknecht in Paris in about a week, that is if you are 
there still. And also his wife and one or two more of the family. 
Domelad  and his Dutchmen seem to stick to their new line. Another 
proof that the little nations can play but a secondary part in Socialist 
development, while they expect to be allowed to lead. The Belgians will 
never give up the idea that their central situation and neutrality give 
them the manifest destiny of being the central seat of the future 
International. The Swiss are and always were philistines and petits bour­
geois, the Danes had become the same and it remains to be seen whether 
Trier, Petersen and Co. can move them on out of this their present stag­
nation. And now the Dutch begin the same way. None of them can 
forget and will forget that at Paris the Germans and French led the way, 
and that they were not allowed to occupy the Congress with their petti­
fogging troubles. Never mind, there is a greater hope now of French, 
Germans and English pulling together, and if the little babies get 
obstreperous, nous en ferons cadeaux aux possibilistes. e

Liebknecht now is awfully anti-possibilistic, says they have turned 
out rogues and traitors and it's impossible to act with them. Whereupon 
I told him we knew that six months ago and told them—him and his 
party—so but they knew better. He pocketed that in silence. He is not 
at all as cock-sure of his infallibility as he used to be—at least if other­
wise,  he does not show it. Otherwise he is personally the opposite of 
what he is in correspondence—he is the old jovial hail-fellow-well-met 
Liebknecht. 
But I must conclude. I have got the two boysa here who were 
enchanted at little Marcel'sb  letter. They have been to the Zoo and want 
to write to their cher papa and I must clear out from the desk. 
Success to Paul in the Cher—I fully expected his fate at Cette, the

math of the congress in the shape of letters of all kinds still pursued me 
and, on top of that, six persons in one room—reflection or repose impos­
sible.  Then back home, only to find Paul* and the soldier,b not to mention 
2 children,0 here, then the dock strike,439  etc. Today at last a brief respite. 
Longuet's two sons, d who have come to stay, do not disturb me. 
We are all of us, Nim, Tussy, Edward and  myself,  tremendously sorry 
that your relations with Louise should have ended in so negative a fash­
ion. But there's no help for it. You two alone are competent to judge, and 
whatever you think is right, the rest of us must accept. But what I don't 
understand—if I can be said to understand anything at all of this busi­
ness—is your continual use of the word 'compassion'—that all you now 
feel for Louise is 'compassion'. Louise has conducted herself throughout 
with such heroism and such womanliness that we cannot admire her 
enough. If anyone is to be pitied in this affair, it certainly isn't Louise. 
And I still maintain you have perpetrated a folly which you will yet live 
to regret. 
As I have already told Adler, this turn in your relations does nothing 
to alter the proposal I made you in regard to the ms. of Volume IV. e The 
work has got to be done and you and Ede are the only people to whom 
I can entrust it. The business of the archives227 has, Paul tells me, like­
wise now been settled which means, no doubt, that you will be coming 
over here again this winter, when we can discuss and make a start on 
what is to be done. Because of the damned congress I've been able to do 
no work at all on Volume III since February, and even now I am kept 
from it by the necessity of bringing out a fourth edition of Volume I, 
which I must attend to first. It's no great task but when one is not 
allowed to spend more than three hours a day at one's desk, it tends to 
be rather long-drawn-out. And then we have got two months of perpet­
ual fog and darkness ahead of us. 
A correspondent in St Petersburg has informed me that the Revue du 
Nord has published a translation of your Klassengegensätze in 
Frankreich and that this has caused a furore in Russia. When you come 
over here I shall give you a hint or two as to how you might, perhaps,

Your articles on the miners in Thuringiaa are the best you have done 
so far—a genuine study that deals exhaustively with the main issues and, 
moreover, aims simply at investigating the facts and not, as in your paper 
on population13 or that on the primaeval family,c at confirming a precon­
ceived opinion. That is why you have succeeded in producing something 
substantial. The work throws light on an important part of German 
history and, though there may be a few minor gaps in the argument, this 
is of no real moment. Reading it, I realised clearly for the first time (what 
I had only dimly and vaguely perceived in Soetbeerd) the extent to which 
gold and silver production in Germany (and Hungary, whence precious 
metals were distributed throughout the West via Germany) provided the 
final impulse which, between 1470 and 1530, put Germany in the lead 
economically in Europe, thereby making her the focal point of the first 
bourgeois revolution, in the religious guise of the so-called Reformation. 
The final impulse in the sense that the guild crafts and the commission 
trade reached a relatively advanced stage of development, thus turning 
the scales in Germany's favour rather than in that of Italy, France or 
England. 
Liebknecht has now come to see that there's nothing to be done with 
the Possibilists 19; when you're talking to him he's not nearly so cocksure 
as he otherwise tends to be, particularly when he writes. How lucky it 
was that the Possibilists refused, since a union of the two congresses 
would have led to fighting and general loss of life and we should have 
been hugely discredited. The campaign launched by the Possibilists and 
the Social Democratic Federation with a view to casting doubts on our 
people's credentials has failed miserably.478 Not only were Adler's reve­
lations about the possibilist Austrianse (in the Labour Elector here) quite 
devastating, but in this country—and this made an even greater impact 
over here—the idiots had admitted Burns to the credentials committee, 
whereupon he mercilessly demolished the credentials of the Social 
Democratic Federation in the columns of the Labour Elector} Hyndman 
represented 28 people! The entire Federation, alleged to be but 1,925 
strong, consists, in fact, of less than half that number!

The Trades Union Congress499 was Broadhurst's swan song. Burns, 
Mann and Bateman, the only people to know the details of the charges 
against Broadhurst, were tied down here by the Dock Strike, and 
Broadhurst benefited from it; but the congress was rigged, everything 
having been done to ensure that only Trades Unionists of the old type 
attended, as was still feasible on this occasion. Nevertheless, there is 
every sign that the old is in the process of disintegration. 
In Denmark the old party leadership have put their foot in it badly 
over the matter of the congress, and the opposition, Trier, Petersen, etc., 
are gaining ground.418  You ought to engage Trier as correspondent for 
the Arbeiter-Zeitung —Gerson Trier, Ahlefeltsgade 16, Copenhagen. 
The Dock Strike has been won. It's the greatest event to have taken 
place in England since the last Reform Bills500  and marks the beginning 
of a complete revolution in the East End. The reason for the universal 
sympathy shown by the press, and even by the philistines, is, 1. Hatred 
of the monopolistic Dock Companies who, instead of writing off the non 
existent capital they have squandered, fleece the shipowners, business­
men and workers so as to be able to declare dividends on it; 2. The knowl­
edge that the Dockers are voters and need to be cajoled if the 16 to 18 East 
End M.P.s of Liberal and Conservative complexion wish to be re-elected 
(which they won't be; this time there'll be Labour M.P.s). What decided 
the victory was the £14,000 from Australia, whereby the Australian 
workers will prevent themselves from suddenly being landed with a mass 
influx of English workers. Burns, Champion, Mann and Tille« have 
earned their laurels, while the Social Democratic Federation was nowhere. 
The strike is to England what the coalminers' strike 435 was to Germany— 
it means that a new system, a vast army, has entered the labour move­
ment. If we can now get by without a war, the fun may soon begin. 
Guesde is standing for parliament in Marseilles, Lafargue in Saint 
Amand (Cher).

Thanks for the Volkszeitung, etc. I was much tickled by the revolution 
in a tea-cup you have had over there. 501 May possibly be a turn for the 
better. The progress of Nemesis is slow but sure and, by a quirk of 
history, it's the very people who have always relied on the support of the 
New Yorkers against the bulk of the party, especially that in the West, 
who are now being overthrown by the New Yorkers.

If I'm writing no more than a postcard it's because there's so much 
work to do. Awaiting me on my return from Eastbourne was the news 
that a fourth edition of Capital, Vol. I, was wanted. Though only a few 
alterations and additional notes will be needed, they will have to be 
selected and worked out all the more carefully, and the printed text will 
require a minute scrutiny in order that no distortion of the sense slips 
through. Again, the references to Book III will now have to be made 
more precise.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 504 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 3 October 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
So after all ours is the only Party able to register an increase in 
strength at the elections. Altogether, though our information is by no 
means complete, we can reckon on 60,000 votes for our candidates, i.e. 

=====第391页=====
380 Letters -1889 
those put forward by the groups represented at our congress473 and, in 
addition, 19,000 which may be accounted ours (the candidates being 
neither Possibilists nor 'Radical Socialists'), but to which we would not 
venture to lay claim in the absence of further advice. 
But how comes it that we over here have been left without any statis­
tical information regarding the elections except for that contained in the 
bourgeois press, from which we cannot possibly deduce the position of 
all those unknown candidates? How are we to know how many votes 
are ours when the papers fail to classify the candidates save in the vaguest 
possible manner? Yet I should say that it would be very much worth 
your while to keep German and English Socialists informed about your 
doings, seeing that you no longer possess a paper through which this 
might be done. And, as you know, we over here are all of us ready to 
work in the interests of your Party as, indeed, we have always done to 
the very best of our ability; but if you French gentlemen will not deign 
to keep us au fait with las cosas  de Francia* we shall be powerless, and 
more than one of our number will tire of a task so little appreciated by 
those for whom it is performed. 
So as soon as possible after the poll send us a complete list of Socialist 
candidates belonging to the groups represented at our congress, as also 
of other Socialists (if any) who are neither Possibilists nor Radical 
Socialists, with the number of votes cast for each in both the first and the 
second ballots. We cannot here run the risk of having our facts contested 
by men like Hyndman, etc., as is bound to happen if we are again 
thrown back on our own sources of information. 
At the congress you set up a National Council505  which passed certain 
resolutions. Not one of you deemed it necessary to breathe a word to us 
about it; and if I hadn't come upon the thing by chance in the Madrid 
Socialista,  it would not have appeared either in the German Sozialdemokrat 
or in the Labour Elector—and, what is more, two months after the event. 
You yourselves must realise that, by carrying on in this way, you are 
playing into the hands of the Possibilists and of their friends in this 
country. 
I have written and asked Bebel506 to send some money for Guesde's 
election campaign, of the importance of which I am very well aware. I 
hope it will be voted, but it must be remembered that the Germans have 
already contributed 500 fr. towards the congress, 1,000 for Saint-
a French affairs 

=====第392页=====
Letters -1889 381 
Etienne,507  900 for the congress report (the first instalment of which 
hardly redounds to the credit of those who compiled it and who seem to 
have gone to undue pains to garble the names), 3 2,500 for the Swiss paperb 
for which, furthermore, they are holding more than 3,500 fr. in reserve. 
In all,  8,400  fr. voted for international purposes, and this on the eve of 
their own general election! And, after all these sacrifices, M. Jaclard goes 
and gratuitously insults them in the Voix by calling them machines who 
vote to order. 508 As if it was the Germans' fault that the workmen of Paris 
are Possibilists or Radicadets327 or Boulangists or nothing at all! It would 
seem that, in Jaclard's eyes, the Germans' ability to accept a majority vote 
and to act in concert of itself constitutes an insult to the Parisian gents, 
and that, if Paris marks time, the rest are forbidden to march on. 
But if memory serves me aright, M. Jaclard is a Blanquist for whom 
Paris is therefore a holy city, Rome and Jerusalem at the same time. 
To come back to the elections. If it is true that Guesde and Thivrier 
stand a chance, and if they are successful, we shall be vastly better placed 
in the Chamber than the Possibilists.—Baudin appears to be a certainty, 
then there's Cluseret, Boyer and Baslu, 509 one or the other of whom will 
succeed and, with four or five such, Guesde could form a group which 
would not only impress the Chamber and the public, but would also 
place the Possibilists in a rum sort of position. It was the co-existence in 
the Reichstag of our deputies and those of the Lassalleans which, more 
than any other circumstance, brought about a merger between the two 
groups, i.e. the capitulation of the Lassalleans. 510 In this case, too, our 
group would be the stronger and would end up by forcing the Dumays 
and the Joffrins to enter its orbit, so that the Possibilist leaders would 
have to choose between capitulation and abdication. 
For the time being, however, all this is the music of the future.449 But 
of one thing you may be sure, and that is that Boulangism is in extremist 
And to my mind that is something of the utmost significance. This has 
been the third attack of Bonapartist fever; the first, involving a genuine 
and great Bonaparte, the second a bogus ditto,d the third a man who isn't 
even a bogus Bonaparte, but simply a bogus hero, bogus general, bogus 
everything, whose chief attribute has been his black charger. And, even 
with this charlatan-cum-adventurer, it was a dangerous business—as you

know better than I. But the acute stage of the attack, the crisis, is over, and 
we may hope that the French people will now cease to suffer from such 
Caesarean fevers—proof that its constitution has grown much more 
robust than it was in 1848. But the Chamber was elected to combat 
Boulangism and is suffering the consequences in the shape of an inher­
ently negative character, which leads me to doubt whether it will be capa­
ble of reaching its natural term. Unless the majority becomes convinced 
of the necessity for constitutional revision, it will soon have to be 
replaced by a new Chamber with a revisionist but anti-Boulangist major­
ity. You, being better acquainted with the elements that make up the new 
majority, will be able to tell me if I am wrong. But I believe that, had it 
not been for the Boulangist episode, there would by now already have 
been a revisionist republican majority, or at any rate a healthy minority. 
All this if there is no war. The Portland Place HUMBUGV defeat will 
at least postpone that but, on the other hand, the amassing of armaments 
by all the powers will have the reverse effect. And if war does come, then 
goodbye to the Socialist movement for some time. Everywhere we shall 
be crushed, disorganised, deprived of elbow-room. France, bound to 
Russia's chariot wheel, will be unable to move and will have to renounce 
all revolutionary pretensions for fear of seeing her ally go over to the 
other camp. With the forces of the two sides pretty well equal, England 
will be in a position to tip the scales in favour of whichever side she may 
take.  This will hold good for two or three years to come but, if war does 
break out later, I am willing to wager that the Germans will be beaten 
hollow for, within three or four years, young Williamb will have replaced 
all the good generals with his favourites—imbeciles or fake geniuses, like 
those who commanded the Austrians and Russians at Austerlitz,511 and 
each with a prescription for military miracles in his pocket. And just now 
Berlin is swarming with that breed, which has every chance of success 
since young William belongs to it  himself. 
Give Laura a kiss from Nim and me. I shall be writing to her soon. 
Yours ever,

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
[Draft] 
[London,] 3 October 1889 
Dear Liebknecht, 
On hearing for certain that Guesde was in the second ballot, i.e. a 
week ago yesterday, I at once sent a most urgent letter to Bebel. What 
was decided I don't know. 512 
As regards your letter from Paris, I stick as firmly to my opinion 
concerning your conduct apropos the congress473 in March and April as 
you do to yours. So it's useless to bicker over what is past. 
As to the Schlesingeriad, I should be very happy were you to succeed 
in ridding yourself of it. Meanwhile you have seen that the affair cannot 
really be hushed up in that way and have been forced to issue a state­
ment, which pleases me greatly.513 Had you issued it at once, the two of 
us would have been spared this unpleasant correspondence. I know as 
well as you do, and you as well as I, that it was by no means just Kautsky 
and I who considered it a scandal that your name should have served to 
shelter a piece such as this by so worthless a fellow. 
At all events your statement relieves me of the need to criticise the 
concoction  myself.  But the thing will inevitably be singled out, precisely 
because your name has unfortunately found its way onto it and not, 
what's more, simply as publisher, but as editor. 
I too regard Guesde's election as highly important. So far as the 
number of votes is concerned, the elections have turned out very well for 
us. I estimate that 60,000 votes were certainly cast in favour of ourselves 
(of those represented at our congress) and a further 18,000 probably so. 
Against this some 43,000 throughout France for the Possibilists. Baudin 
seems a certainty, also Boyer, Cluseret and Ferroul and besides these 
there are a few others whose prospects look bright. If Guesde gets in as 
well, he's the sort of man round whom they would all rally. In which 
case the Possibilists, Joffrin and Dumay, will be in the same situation as 
the Lassalleans were in the Reichstag in 1874 and then, but only then, can 
there be any question of our having dealings with them, just as we had 
dealings with the Lassalleans in Germany; 510 and it is a condition of our 

=====第395页=====
384 Letters-1889 
success that until that time they should be treated as enemies and 
belaboured as such, that they should learn to respect the might of our 
people. 
At all events Boulangism137  is done for and will presumably be dealt 
further blows at the second ballots, unless the fatuous annulment of the 
poll in Montmartre 514 brings it new supporters, at least in Paris. If the 
Russians' cash then fails to appear, le brave général will have to move 
from Portland Place to Soho, a or rent a couple of rooms from Lessner.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 274 
London, 8 October 1889 
My dear Laura, 
What a melancholy set our French friends are! Because Paul and 
Guesde have not succeeded, they seem to despair of everything and Paul 
thinks the less said about these elections, the better! Why, I consider the 
result of the elections not a déroute 0 but a relative success worth regis­
tering both in England and Germany. At the first ballots we had between 
60 and 80,000 votes, which is quite enough to show that we are nearly 
twice as strong as the Possibilists, and while they got but two men d (of 
whom one moribunde) elected, we have Baudin, Thivrier, Lachize, and 
a then  a poor district, where many émigrés lived - b Liebknecht's son -  c defeat -
d J. B. Dumay and J. F.  A. Joffrin -  e Joffrin

Letters -1889 385 
then Cluseret and Ferroul who are bound to cast in their lot with the 
first three; that makes five to two, and will be sufficient, with proper 
management, to put the two Possibilists in a very impossible position. 
But both in England and Germany, the effect will be made, not by the 
number of seats secured but by the number of votes given. So let me ask 
you to see to it that we get, as soon as possible, say not later than 
Monday morning next, but if possible before, the list of votes cast for 
our candidates at 1st and 2nd ballots, for the Labour Elector and the 
Sozialdemokrat. Surely Paul will not push the droit à la paresse 35^ far 
enough to refuse us that little bit of work. 
Of course Guesde's defeat is a misfortune, but then while I thought 
it necessary to do everything to prevent it, I never believed much in his 
success, after the 1,445 votes au premier tour! 0 What cannot be helped 
we must put up with. It is a far greater advantage for us to have got rid 
of Boulanger. Boulanger in France and the Irish question in England are 
the two great obstacles in our way, the two side-issues which prevent 
the formation of an independent working men's party. Now Boulanger 
is smashed up, the road is cleared in France. And at the same time, the 
monarchist attack on the Republic has failed. That means the gradual 
passage of monarchism from the ground of practical to that of senti­
mental, politics, the transfer of Monarchists to Opportunism, 199 the 
formation of a new Conservative party out of both, and the struggle of 
that Conservative-Bourgeois-party with the petits bourgeois and peas­
ants (Radicals 200) and the working class; a struggle in which the work­
ing-class Socialists will soon get the upper hand of the Radicals, espe­
cially after the way they have discredited themselves. I do not expect 
that everything will pass off in this simple, classical form, but the innate 
logic of French development is sure to overcome all side-issues and 
obstacles, especially as both forms of antiquated (not simply bourgeois) 
reaction—Boulangism and monarchism—have been so well beaten. 
And all we can ask for is that all these side-issues be removed and that 
the field be clear for the struggle of the three great sections of the 
French society: bourgeois, petits bourgeois et paysans, ouvriers? And 
that I think we shall get. 
Then Ferry is got rid of and I think Mother Crawford is right when 
she considers him an obstacle to even his own party.516 Colonial adven­
tures will no longer bar the way; nor will the formation of the new 
a right to idleness - b in the first ballot - c and peasants, workers 

=====第397页=====
386 Letters -1889 
bourgeois party be trammelled by the necessity of respecting the tradi­
tions of Ferryism. 
Thus I do not despair at all, on the contrary; I see a distinct advance 
in the result of the elections, eine sehr bestimmte Klärung der Lage* Of 
course you will get Conservative government to begin with; but not 
what you had, the government of a distinct set of the bourgeoisie only. 
The Opportunists were as much a mere section of the French bour­
geoisie as were the satisfaits^ 17 of Louis-Philippe and Guizot: these were 
the haute finance}' the others are the set which strives to become the 
haute finance. Now, for the first time, you will get a real government of 
the entire bourgeoisie. In  1849-51,  the Rue de Poitiers 518 under Thiers, 
too, formed a government of the whole bourgeois class, but that was by 
the truce between the two opposing monarchical parties, and by its very 
nature passager. c Now you will get one based upon the despair to upset 
the republic, upon its recognition as an unavoidable pis-aller^ and there­
fore a bourgeois government which has the stuff to last until its final 
smash-up. 
It was the splitting-up of the French bourgeoisie into so many 
sections, fractions and factions which has so often deceived the people. 
You upset one section, say the haute finance, and thought you had upset 
the whole bourgeoisie; but you merely brought into power another 
section. There are 1/ the legitimist or generally monarchist landed 
proprietors, 2/ the old haute finance of Louis-Philippe's time, 3/ the 
second set of haute finance of the Second Empire, 4/ the Opportunists199 
who to a great extent have still their fortunes to make, 5/ the industrial 
and commercial bourgeoisie chiefly of the provinces, who are generally 
hangers-on, practically, to whatever section happens to be in power, 
being themselves scattered and without their common centre. Now these 
all will now have to unite as 'Moderates' and 'Conservatives', will have 
to drop their old shibboleths and party-cries which divided them, and 
for the first time act as a bourgeoisie une et indivisible? And this concen­
tration bourgeoise will be the real meaning of all the concentrations 
républicaines et autres 1 so much talked about of late, and it will be a great 
progress, leading gradually to a scattering of Radicals and a real concen­
tration of Socialists. 
Ouf! Now that's enough on this blessed subject. Tonight I expect 
a a very definite clarification of the position - b high finance - c short-lived -
evil - e one and indivisible - i republican and others

I don't know whether I wrote and told you that Sam Moore left for 
Asaba on the Niger (Africa) in June as Chief Justice for the territories of

is not very great—75° F in the mornings and 81°-83° a in the afternoons. 
Cool, therefore, by comparison with New York. Thus the 3rd volume of 
Capital will probably be translated into English in Africa. I am working

My dear Laura, 
Many thanks from Nim and myself for the splendid box of pears which 
arrived in capital condition and into which we have already eaten a 
considerable hole. I stick to my American habit 1 of eating fruit every 
morning before breakfast and so you may imagine that the rate of disap­
pearance of the produce of your garden is anything but slow. Tussy and 
Pumps, too, will claim their shares—in fact they are already set apart. 
Since the Dock Strike489 Tussy has become quite an East-Ender, 
organising Trades Unions and supporting strikes—last Sunday we did 
not see her at all, as she had to speechify both morning and night. These 
new Trades Unions of unskilled men and women are totally different 
from the old organisations of the working-class aristocracy and cannot 
fall into the same conservative ways; they are too poor, too shaky, too 
much composed of unstable elements, for anyone of these unskilled 
people may change his trade any day. And they are organised under 
quite different circumstances—all the leading men and women are 
Socialists and Socialist agitators too. In them I see the real beginning of 
the movement here. 
The Federation62  is for the moment played out—the violent attacks of 
Justice on Champion, Burns, etc., have suddenly ceased, there is instead 
a sort of hidden, verschämtes 0 sighing for some sort of universal broth­
erhood—the last report of the French elections 521 for instance gives our 
results too, and without any nasty allusions or remarks; it looks as if the 
rank and file had become rebellious. If our lot here—I mean Champion 
especially—don't make mistakes, they will soon have it all their own 
way. But I confess I cannot get myself to have full confidence in that 
man—he is too dodgy. He used to go to Church congresses and preach

Socialism there, and now he has formed a Committee for organising the 
East End women with a lot of middle class philanthropists who held a 
meeting with the bishop of Bedford in the chair—and of course from 
this business they took good care to exclude Tussy! Now I don't like 
that, and if they go on that way I shall soon leave them alone. Burns is 
too fond of popularity to be able to resist such things and goes in with 
Champion—if I once see him alone, I shall speak to him. 
Longuet told us you had said you were coming over at Christmas. We 
shall be very glad to see you here and have everything comfortable for 
you, unless you prefer coming in the better season, as you said to Nim 
you would do next time. But then what is the better season here? After 
the exceptionally fine summer we had (and are having, for it is a regular 
rheinischer Altweibersommer* now) perhaps we are in for a whole year's 
rain! 
Sam Moore has arrived at Asaba and has sentenced, as soon as he put 
his foot ashore in Africa, a Nigger Captain of a Steamer to 9 months 
hard labour for attempted rape. He says the climate is very fine, 23°C in 
the morning, 26-29° at 3 in the afternoon (in July and August!) and to all 
appearance healthy. Fuller news we are promised, but alas, between 
Akassa and Asaba (both on the Niger) there seems to be no regular mail, 
and the post-mark of Akassa is the stamp of the Niger Co. with the date 
filled in in ink! 
Love from Nim.

ENGELS TO CONRAD SCHMIDT 
IN BERLIN 
London, 17 October 1889 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
Dear Schmidt, 
Your work,a which you kindly sent me and for which I am most 
grateful, has brought us so much closer together that I no longer can 
bring myself to address you in the ceremonious style required by 
custom and, if you would like to oblige me, perhaps you would treat me 
similarly. 
Even though I cannot actually say that you have solved the problem 
under discussion,298 your own line of reasoning coincides with that of 
Volume III of Capital at many, and indeed, at important, points, and 
does so in such a way that the reading of Volume III will give you quite 
exceptional pleasure. For obvious reasons I am barred from making a 
detailed criticism of your work just at present; this will be done in the 
preface to Volume IIIb, when it will give me particular satisfaction to 
accord your work the full recognition that is its due. So until then, 
perhaps you will be patient. This much however is now quite certain— 
that your work has secured you a place in economic literature that must 
be the envy of all the worthy professors. 
The work has been a source of particular pleasure to me personally in 
one further respect, namely by showing that we now have someone else 
who can think theoretically. Among the younger generation in Germany 
there are remarkably few who are capable of doing so. Bebel, who has a 
fine theoretical brain, is prevented by his practical party work from exer­
cising this, the best of his attributes, other than in the application of 
theory to practical cases. Consequently there have hitherto been only 
Bernstein and Kautsky, though in Bernstein's case far too much of his 
time is taken up by practical activities for him to be able to participate 
in, and further his knowledge of, the theoretical side as much as he 
would no doubt like and be capable of doing. And there is, after all, so 
aSchmidt, Die Durchschnittsprofitrate auf Grundlage des Marx'schen 
Werthgesetzes  - b See present edition, Vol. 37

much still to be done here in the way of theory, especially in the field of 
economic history and its links with political history, as with the history of 
law, religion, literature and civilisation generally where the only sure guide 
through the labyrinth of facts is a clear theoretical insight. So you can 
imagine how I patted myself on the back for finding a new collaborator. 
It's a very good thing that you should be re-editing Knapp's 
Bauernbefreiung for the Neue Zeit. Excellent material for this task is 
provided by Wolff's Schlesische Milliarde from the Neue Rheinische 
Zeitung of 1849, reprinted as No. VI of Volume I of the 
Sozialdemokratische Bibliothek. I shall send it to you in separate sheets 
enclosed in English newspapers, which would seem to be a pretty safe 
way. Kautsky will also be glad to have found another capable contribu­
tor—he has to accept quite enough trash. 
I haven't been able to do a stroke of work on Volume III since 
February. That damned Paris congress473 saddled me with such a mess of 
correspondence to all parts of the globe that everything else had to be 
pushed into the background. The chaps had everywhere lost their inter­
national contacts and as a result hatched up the most incredible 
schemes—sheer good will and a lack of knowledge of one another, as of 
things and circumstances, would have given rise to some fine old set-tos 
and everywhere the chaps would have made enemies of their friends, yet 
failed to appease their enemies. But luckily that's all over now and I've 
just had news that a 4th edition of Volume I is needed. And since the 
English edition2 has appeared in the meantime and a comparison by Mrs 
Aveling of each quotation with its original revealed occasional formal 
discrepancies but an even greater number of copyists' and printers' 
errors in the relevant passages, I cannot possibly allow the 4th edition to 
appear unless I put these right. All this will take time, after which I shall 
have the proofs to correct, but in a fortnight or so I shall get back to 
Volume III and thereafter allow nothing whatever to get in my way. I 
think I'm past the most difficult bits. 
Kindest regards from 
Yours very sincerely,

ENGELS TO MAX HILDEBRAND 522 
IN BERLIN 
London, 22 October 1889 
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W. 
Dear Sir, 
In reply to your note of the 19th,523 I made Stirner's acquaintance 
around the beginning of 1842 in Berlin191 when he was hobnobbing with 
E. Meyen, Buhl, Edgar and subsequently Bruno Bauer, etc. It is true that 
his name was Schmidt; he owed the nickname of Stirner1 to his remark­
ably high forehead. He cannot have been hobnobbing with this circle for 
very long, since he didn't know Marx, who had left Berlin, if my 
memory is correct, less than a year previously524  and was much 
respected by the others. He was, I think, no longer a grammar school 
master or at any rate ceased to be one shortly afterwards. Apart from the 
above named, others who used to meet together at that time were a 
certain von Leitner, an Austrian, K. F. Koppen, who taught at a grammar 
school and was a special friend of Marx's, Mussak, his colleague, 
Cornelius, the bookseller who appears in Fritz Reuter's Festungstid, 
Miigge, Dr J. Klein, the dramatist and dramaturgist, a certain 
Wachenhusen, Dr Zabel, subsequently editor of the National-Zeitung, 
Rutenberg who, however, left for Cologne shortly afterwards to join the 
first Rheinische Zeitung, a certain Waldeck b (not the jurist and high 
court counsellor0 ) and others whose names escape me; there were in fact 
several groups which would meet and mingle depending on the time and 
the opportunity. Jungnitz, Szeliga and Faucher did not arrive until after 
November 1842, the month in which I completed my year of military 
service and left Berlin. We would meet at Stehely's and, in the evenings, 
at this or that Bavarian ale-house in Friedrichsstadt d or, if we were in 
funds,  at a wineshop in the Poststrasse, which was Köppen's favourite 
haunt. I knew Stirner well and we were on Du e terms; he was a good 
sort, not nearly as bad as he makes himself out to be in his Einzige^ and

with a slight suggestion of pedantry that had clung to him since his 
teaching days. We discussed Hegelian philosophy a great deal; at that 
time he had made the discovery that Hegel's logic begins with an 
error. Being, which proves to be Nothing and thus becomes the 
antithesis of  itself,  cannot be the beginning; the beginning must 
consist in something which is itself already the immediate, sponta­
neously evolved unity of Being and Nothing and from which alone 
that antithesis arises. And this, according to Stirner, was 'It' (it 
snows, it rains), something which is and which, at the same time, is 
Nothing. Later on he seems to have come round to the realisation 
that there was, after all, nothing in It, any more than in Being and 
Nothing. 
I saw less of Stirner during the latter part of my time in Berlin; no 
doubt he was even then pursuing the lines of reasoning that resulted in 
his magnum opus. By the time it came out, our views had already 
diverged a great deal; the two years I had spent in Manchester had left 
their mark on me.525 When, later on in Brussels,526 Marx and I felt it 
necessary to join issue with the offshoots of the Hegelian school, we 
criticised Stirner amongst others—the critique is as bulky as the book 
itself.  The ms.,a which has never been published, is still here in my house 
in so far as it hasn't been eaten by mice. 
Stirner enjoyed a revival thanks to Bakunin who, by the way, was also 
in Berlin at the time and, during Werder 's course of lectures on logic 
(1841-42), sat on the bench in front of me along with four or five other 
Russians. Proudhon's harmless, purely etymological anarchy (i.e. 
absence of government) would never have resulted in the present anar­
chist doctrines had not Bakunin laced it with a good measure of 
Stirnerian 'rebellion'. 527 As a result the anarchists have themselves 
become nothing but a collection of 'Unique Ones', so much so that no 
two of them can abide one another's company. 
For the rest I know nothing about Stirner; I never found out what 
subsequently befell him, except that Marx told me he had almost liter­
ally starved to death; where he got this from, I don't know. 
I saw his wifeb  in this country on one occasion; while here she took 
up with - ah que  j'aime  le militaire^ - ex-Lieutenant Techow and, if I'm 
not mistaken, accompanied him to Australia.

Dear Sir, 
In reply to your circular529 I regret to inform you that as the papers 
in my possession have not been sorted for the past 20 years, I cannot 
possibly search out  F. A. Lange's letters—there are only a few—from the 
pile until I have 3 or 4 weeks' spare time in which to put the whole lot 
in order. As soon as I have finished the final editing of Volume III of 
Marx's Capital—some time early next year—I must address myself to 
this task, for it admits of no further delay, whereupon I shall be glad to 
place the aforementioned letters at your disposal. 
You may, of course, publish my letters to Lange in full or in part 
depending on the circumstances, but in the latter case I would ask you to 
be good enough to ensure that the passages concerned appear in their full 
context. 
Yours faithfully,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 274 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 29 October 1889 
My dear Laura, 
A solemn vote of thanks I have to transmit to you for the fresh batch 
of pears sent by Edward and consumed, in great part, last Sunday with 
the port wine. They were splendid, and what was left will be mellow by 
next Sunday. 
The Christmas trip legenda was also explained by Edward—that it 
was little Marcelb  who caused the misunderstanding in Longuet 's brain. 
Anyhow, whenever you are ready to come, we shall be ready to receive 
you. 
I must have expressed myself rather badly about the impending rule of 
the French bourgeoisie as a class.0 1 meant that zunächst^ the rank and file 
of the Royalists and Bonapartists will pass over—gradually—into the 
ranks of the Moderate Republicans, and forsake, as in  1851,  when the mass 
of the Republicans and Royalists passed over to Bonaparte, such of their 
leaders as will stick to their old-fashioned party shibboleths. That will 
mean a strengthening of the Moderate Republicans (though not necessar­
ily of the Ferryist or the Léon Sayist cliques of speculators) but at the same 
time a cessation, once for all, of the power of the old cry: La république en 
danger? 53° Then, and only then, the Radicals200 can come to the fore as 
'Her Majesty's, the Republic's, most faithful opposition', and then you 
have the real conditions of the rule of the whole bourgeois class, of parlia­
mentarism in full blossom: two parties struggling for the majority and 
taking in turns the parts of Ins and Outs, of Government and opposition. 
Here, in England, you have the rule of the whole bourgeois class; but that 
does not mean that Conservatives and Radicals coalesce; on the contrary, 
they relieve each other. If things were to take their slow, classical course, 
then the rise of the Proletarian party would no doubt finally force them to 
coalesce against this new and unparliamentary opposition. But that is not 
likely to come off; there will be violent accelerations of the development.

=====第408页=====
Letters -1889 397 
The progress consists, to my mind in the proof that to fight against 
the Republic has become hopeless; in the consequent gradual dying out 
of all anti-Republican parties, which means the participation of all 
sections of the bourgeoisie in the government—as Ins, or as Outs; the 
Ins to be, for the present, the reinforced Moderates, and the Outs the 
Radicals. One election cannot do everything at once, let us be satisfied 
that this one has cleared the ground. 
About the defeat of the Socialists we agree perfectly. Only that I 
expected it—and a far worse one—and that our Paris friends have 
expected miracles which of course did not come off. I am perfectly satis­
fied with the result—under the circumstances. That we got six or seven 
men in against either the Cadettists327 or the Boulangists, and something 
like 120,000 votes, is more than I expected. 
As to the policy with regard to the fellows that came in under 
Boulanger's flag, I am rather of the opinion of Vaillant and Guesde than 
of Paul. If you admit the Boulangists, you must admit the Cadettists 
too—Joffrin and Dumay. But moreover, after the infamous way in 
which the Boulangeo-Blanquists 494 behaved to Vaillant in his circon­
scription* and brought him to fall, we ought I believe not to have 
anything to do with them. Moreover, we have no interest to reconstitute 
the dissolving Blanquist faction as such. We know what peculiarly 'pure' 
elements it always contained. Granger is an imbecile chauvin, to have 
got rid of whom appears to me a blessing. As to Jourde (who seems to 
me the one after whom Paul really longs), perhaps he can be made to slip 
in later on, if he vaut la peine, ce que j'ignore^  and if he breaks off point 
blank with the Boulangists. But there is no mistake, Paul's whilom 
Boulangist sympathies have done us an immense deal of harm and are 
now being used by Liebknecht who throws them into my face. 
As it is, the new socialist faction will be hard to manage, and the less 
its numbers are swelled by doubtful (still more doubtful) elements, the 
better it will be. Especially as Guesde is not elected. If the thing is found 
to work well, then fresh additions of the above sort might be less harm­
ful and could be taken into consideration; and then, the novices ought to 
do public penance, unless the French party is to stand out as corrupt 
before the Germans, Swiss, Dutch and even Belgians. What a triumph 
would it be for the Possibilists 19 if they could point to declared 
Boulangists in our ranks! And how difficult then for me to make the 
Germans understand the doings of our French party! 
a constituency - b deserves it, which I do not know

Now another subject. Percy is completely smashed up. In order to

avoid an open bankruptcy, but how that may end nobody can tell; and 
unless it comes to something, he will have to declare himself bankrupt

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 
London, 29 October 1889 
Dear Liebknecht, 
I can tell you very little about the Prophet Gottschalk, having long 
since forgotten the creature. Moses Hess brought him into the League 531 
prior to 1848 and made him out to be a veritable prodigy. In Cologne

early in March 1848 he posed as a working men's leader.532 For the 
conditions as they then were, he was the perfect demagogue who flat­
tered the masses at the very moment of their awakening and pandered to 
all their traditional prejudices—but apart from that he was a complete 
numskull, as befits a prophet, and for that reason actually regarded 
himself as a prophet. Moreover, as a genuine prophet he was above all 
scruples and thus capable of every kind of dirty trick. Whether he ever 
uttered the words you cite533 seems to me doubtful; he would systemat­
ically invent legends about  himself.  In short, he played a certain role in 
Cologne at the beginning of March and had quite crazy schemes, the 
details of which I have forgotten, that were supposed to work miracles 
overnight. All this was before our time. When we arrived in Cologne in 
April his star was very much on the wane and, when we foregathered 
there again, having finally decided to publish the paper,a it had all but set. 
The paper and our Workers' Association534  placed him in a quandary; 
either he went along with us or he opposed us. Luckily for him, he and 
Anneke were arrested at the beginning of July—on account of speeches 
of some sort, I believe. They were acquitted at the end of 1848 or the 
beginning of 1849 (I have been vainly searching through the Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung for the date, etc., and shall have to discontinue the 
search if this letter is to go off). Thereupon the Prophet Gottschalk went 
into voluntary exile in Paris in the expectation of being recalled by 
gigantic demonstrations. But no one lifted a finger. After our departure 
Gottschalk returned to Cologne (it might even have been just before we 
left) and, having gained his former popularity on the strength of his 
medical practice in the poorer districts, went back into harness with a 
will at the outbreak of the cholera epidemic, treated his proletarian 
patients free of charge, contracted cholera  himself,  and died. 
That is all I know. 
In Paris things would seem to have settled down again. Laf argue is by 
no means as bad as you make him out to be—Jourde is no Boulangist; 
rather, he masqueraded as a Boulangist in Bordeaux with the consent of 
the local party comrades, which I, of course, definitely disapprove of. 
The man has blundered and will have to pay for it, at any rate for the 
time being. If, however, he is all right in other respects, and that is some­
thing I don't know, he may be restored to grace later on. 
I'm very sorry that the Volks-Bibliothek 535 should have involved you

in such losses. But in view of your lack of business experience it was 
only to be expected that Geiser would land you in the cart. After all, the 
rotten stuff he published was made no better by having your name on it, 
while the Schlesingeriad must inevitably have proved the last straw. 
That, I think, explains it all quite naturally, without your needing to seek 
the reason in the ill-will of others. You surely can't expect the party to 
enthuse over this Volks-Bibliothek. 
I too am having a bad time. Percy has gone bankrupt and the whole 
family is living here so as to avoid execution at their house; nothing has 
been decided yet. Negotiations are going on with the old mana but he 
maintains that he himself is in a mess—and he's really a bit cracked. In

gone.b How it will all end I don't know.

Only one thing can be said with certainty, and that is that neither here 
not anywhere else in Europe would it be possible to find anything for 
you. Your proximity to Italy would mean that, wherever you were, they 
would demand your extradition, and not for a moment would you be 
safe. 
To find you even temporary employment in this country would be 
utterly impossible. Neither I nor my friends could procure this for you— 
your having been sentenced could not be kept secret. It would be impos­
sible to accommodate you on the Sozialdemokrat. And in any case, the 
demand for your extradition would soon catch up with you. On the 
other side of the Atlantic things might be different. 
So there only remains the choice between prison and Buenos Aires. 
If you are finally convicted by the court of appeal and go to prison, it 
seems unlikely that, on the day of your release, you will have any other 
alternative but to go to Buenos Aires, for you would surely not be able 
to find work in Europe. In my opinion, therefore, the only question is 
whether you want to go now, or after having spent three or four years 
in gaol. 
Should you decide to go now, I can put 200 francs at your disposal as 
a contribution towards your travelling expenses. But this is the last help 
I shall be able to give you. At the moment I am having to maintain two 
families who are related to me, which means that I am myself sometimes 
at a loss to know where to turn for the necessary cash. 
I am sorry that I cannot do more for you. But the funds I have avail­
able are limited, and I am powerless against the Italian judiciary. I know 
full well how desperate your plight is and assure you of my sincere 
sympathy but it is not in my power to help you beyond the extent indi­
cated above. 
Very sincerely yours,

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN 
London, 15 November 1889 
Dear Bebel, 
I got your letter of 17 October when I was up to my eyes in work on 
the 4th edition of Capital3'—no small task, as it meant comparing yet again 
all the quotations Tussy had checked for the English edition and correct­
ing the numerous copyist's and printer's errors. Hardly had that been done 
than I had to set to work again on Volume III, which has now got to be 
brought out quickly, for in Berlin little Schmidt has published a work on 
the average rate of profitb which shows that the laddie has—greatly to his 
credit—puzzled out more than one could wish. So you can see that my 
hands are already completely full; add to that the necessity of keeping up 
with the international party press and referring back to the economic liter­
ature relevant to Volume III, some of which has to be read cover to 
cover—and you will see that I'm pretty well bogged down and hence you 
must forgive me if I don't communicate with you as often as I should like. 
As for the French,537 if you were to spend longer in their midst and 
become more closely acquainted with the sort of effect produced by 
their curious modes of procedure, you would probably take a more 
lenient view. The Party33 there found itself in what was, for France, the 
unprecedented, if in the long run favourable, position of being strong in 
the provinces and weak in Paris. Thus what was needed was a victory of 
the steady-going provinces over arrogant, domineering, supercilious and 
partially corrupt Paris (the corruption being evident in 1. The domi­
nance there of the corrupt Possibilist leaders, 2. The fact that successful 
opposition to that domination could, in Paris, only take the form of 
Boulangism). On top of that, there were two executives in the 
provinces—one in Bordeaux for the Trades Unions and one in Troyes538 
for the socialist groups, these being organised as such. So they lacked not 
only the customary executive in Paris (or any possibility thereof) but

also a unified provincial executive resp. the intellectual aptitude for such 
and the general recognition it would call for. 
That the position during this interregnum should seem to you people 
exceedingly confused and unsatisfactory I can quite understand. It is but 
temporary, however, but it was typical of the French that, despite such a 
disorganisation of their own party, and despite having made one mistake 
after another, they should nevertheless have convoked a congress in 
Paris 473 where all this must be plain for Europe to see. They rightly 
considered that any discredit incurred would be far outweighed by the 
fact of Europe's being represented at their congress and no more than a 
few sects at that of the Possibilists.478 
That the creation of an immediate impact on the public should be to 
them a consideration of greater moment than it is to you and me and the 
bulk of the German party is a failing that is not confined to France. Here 
and in America the case is just the same. It comes from the greater free­
dom of their political life and their long familiarity with it. Besides, 
Liebknecht is acting in just the same way in Germany (one of the chief 
reasons for our perpetual rows), and, if you were to abolish the Anti-
Socialist Law 52 tomorrow, you'd soon see how quickly the deplorable 
consideration mentioned above would come to the fore. 
Again, I think you would be deceiving yourself were you to conclude 
from what you experienced at the Paris congress that the working men 
were being thrust into the background by, say, the literary men. Such 
may appear to be the case at a congress in Paris, the more so as the 
impossibility of communicating in foreign languages thrusts the work­
ing men into the background. In actual fact the French workers set far 
greater store than those of any other country by complete and, in partic­
ular, formal, equality with men of letters and bourgeois, and, had you 
read the reports I received regarding Guesde's, Lafargue's, etc., agitation 
during the last elections,539 you would probably take a different view. 
It was only on account of Protot (see enclosed proclamation) that 
Guesde wasn't elected at Marseilles. 540 In France (because the number 
of candidates is not restricted in the second ballot, while the relative 
majority is decisive) it is the general rule that where there are 2 candi­
dates of the same party, the one who polled fewer votes at the first 
ballot must stand down. Protot was in that position, but he remained a 
candidate and disseminated the most infamous calumnies about 
Guesde. Neither was known locally in Marseilles but, as an old member 
of the Commune, Protot was supported by the followers of that brag­
gart Pyat, the former deputy for Marseilles. Hence it was understand-

able that he should obtain the 900 votes that would have put Guesde in 
the Chamber. The best constituency in Marseilles had been chosen by 
Boyer who had, indeed, previously been returned there, and it was he 
who got in. 
So now we have 7 men—by no means the best possible ones. They 
have chosen Guesde for their secretary and he is to concoct their 
speeches for them. On the Municipal Council, Vaillant, Longuet and 
others likewise constitute a separate group. The two groups will enlist 
the co-operation of Lafargue, Deville, etc., and afterwards form a central 
committee of the united (or federated) Blanquists and Marxists. 541 In this 
way an organisation will gradually take shape. 
Besides the above, 3 socialists were elected as Boulangists and 2 as 
Possibilists but these will, of course, be excluded and allowed to fend for 
themselves. 
I am very sorry that Auer should be in such poor case542—but no 
doubt you'll be getting better news anon. I can only deplore the relative 
weakness—and this also applies in the field of theory—of the younger 
generation. But now we have got little Schmidt; he was here for a year 
and I should never have guessed how much he had in him. If he retains 
his former modesty—megalomania being today the most insidious and 
commonest of diseases—he may do excellently. 
Over here everything is going swimmingly, but not along the same 
simple, straightforward lines as in Germany. That calls for people with a 
natural aptitude for theory. In this country we shall have blunders and 
to spare. But never mind; the masses are now in motion and every new 
blunder will bring its own lesson with it. So man tau, 3- as the Lower 
Saxons say.

ENGELS TO J. H. JOHNSON, J. JOHNSON 
AND G. B. ELLIS 
IN LONDON 
[London, 15 November 1889] 
[Draft] 
Dear Sirs, 
I have received and considered your letter of the 7th inst.543 It strikes 
me as rather peculiar that you expect me to treat your enquiries as 'confi­
dential', but never offer to extend the same treatment to my reply. Of 
course I cannot undertake such one-sided engagements. 
If I understand you rightly, I am to report to you and eventually name 
the author of any reports I may have heard on board, from passengers, 
officers, or sailors, as far as they may have been disrespectful towards the 
circulating pumps of the City of New York. Such communications, if 
any, could only be made to me in the expectation that I would treat them 
after the manner of gentlemen, and not bring their authors into difficul­
ties even supposed they had used an unguarded word or two. To act 
otherwise, would in my opinion be to turn common informer. Unless I 
misinterpret what seems to me the clear meaning of your proposal, that 
is what it amounts to; and in that case it is of a naivete equalled only by 
its refreshing coolness. 
Anyhow, to set your minds at rest, I will tell you that I don't recol­
lect that anybody in my presence, cast the slightest slur upon the immac­
ulate circulating pumps which you have the honour to represent and that 
I neither know nor care who made them. 
I will not condescend to ask you to treat this letter as confidential. A 
perusal of this correspondence by a Continental or American lawyer or 
man of business might lead to some valuable hints as to the manner of 
conducting similar enquiries.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 274 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 16 November, 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
Let us say no more about your proclivity for Boulangism, now happily 
a thing of the past, and why re-read, at this late date, your letters of yester­
year? In any case the gallant general has ruined  himself,  not only by his fail­
ure to remain on the field of battle, but—and this was infinitely worse—by 
his royalist and Bonapartist alliances; this he now sees and would like to 
recover his Republican virginity but, as in the case of the fair Eugénie: 
Should he this night find a maidenhead, 
(Bonaparte, on his wedding-night) 
It'll mean the fair lady had two. 
No one is in any doubt that the discontent underlying Boulangism137 
is justified, but it is precisely the form assumed by that discontent which 
goes to show that the majority of Parisian working men are as little 
aware of their situation as in 1848 and 1851. Then, too, their discontent 
was justified; the form it assumed, Bonapartism, cost us eighteen years 
of Empire—and what an Empire! And at that time a fair number of the 
Parisian working men were still fighting against it; but in 1889 they 
thought fit to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of 1789 by grovelling 
at the feet of a mere scallywag. That being so, you can hardly expect 
other people to defer to the Parisians with the same respect they so read­
ily accorded their forebears. 
I am much relieved to hear that the Boulangists—genuine or other­
wise—have been kept at arm's length by the Party, and the Possibilists19 
likewise. Had they been admitted such as they are I should have been at 
a loss what to say to the English, Danes, Germans, etc. For the past 
twenty years we have been advocating the formation of a Party that was 
distinct from and opposed to all bourgeois parties—and the inclusion of 
men elected under Boulanger's banner, a banner whose protection, in 
those same elections, was extended to the Monarchists and repudiated 
by them—would have spelt our French Party's ruin vis-à-vis other 

=====第418页=====
Letters -1889 407 
national parties. And how exultant would the Hyndmans and Smiths 
have been then! 
You say that the attacks on Boulé achieved nothing save to gain him 
access to the Intransigeant and to get him nominated as a municipal candi­
date—in other words, publicly profess himself a Boulangist, fall into line 
with that crew and receive the due reward of his treachery. 544 Thank you! 
Your plan is very good if it is practicable—if, that is to say, the 
provinces are prepared to assume the leadership of this committee.3 
You keep talking about your provincial papers, but you hardly ever 
send me any.545  A few used to be forwarded to me by Bonnier, but now 
I seldom see one. Everything you send me, or get others to send me, will 
bear fruit in that it will help me keep Bebel posted, and Bebel is ten times 
more important than Liebknecht; if, moreover, I know what is going on, 
I can get to work on Ede and the Sozialdemokrat. 
It would be a good idea if all your newspapers were to arrange 
exchanges with the Sozialdemokrat and the Labour Elector, 13 Paternoster 
Row, E. C. In all other countries this is done as a matter of course; but the 
French gentlemen wait to be begged—and sometimes begged in vain—to 
put us in a position to work in their interest. Should this kind of behaviour 
exceed certain limits, we for our part might begin to tire. Is it really too 
much to expect some small modicum of order and organisation? 
But enough of that. I stand up for you so often and with such ardour 
vis-à-vis other people that, by way of return, it is only fair that I should 
give you a thorough dressing-down. At the moment I have no means of 
checking M. de Paepe's intimations 546 and the Vienna Arbeiterzeitung 
has received confirmation of his death b from St. Petersburg; in view of 
the Russian government's mendacity and the myths about Russian revo­
lutionaries, there's no knowing what is true and what is false. 
Now for Laura. 
Yours ever,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 16 November 1889 
My dear Laura, 
After I finished the enclosed to Paul, I went in the kitchen and had 
some Pilsener with Nim and Pumps, partly for the sake of the Pilsener 
and partly because I am ordered to write with interruptions only. 
Having been, before, to the bank to pay in Sonnenschein 's cheque, 
because I cannot afford to run the risk of keeping it, it will not astonish 
you to learn that it is now close upon four p.m. and as I dare not write 
by the gas-light you see I am rather pinched for time. 
Anyhow you have done a marvellous thing in the Senator^7, about 
the most difficult thing on earth to be put into English. Not only that 
you have done it with all the proper impropriety, but even with a near 
approach to the lightness of the original. And that while both subject 
and metre are rebellious to translation, the Senator of Empire No. la 
being an unknown quantity over here. If you were a boy I should say: 
Molodétz, but I am not versed enough in Russian to know whether that 
epithet (equal about to the English: you're a brick!) can be feminised 
into:  Molodtzàl 
The reflex of Thivrier's blouse has fallen upon, and lighted up for a 
moment, even the English press.548 If he tears a hole into it, the whole 
respectability of great Britain will cry out about the bad manners of 
these Frenchmen. Barring old Mother Crawford, who is Irish and with 
all her crotchets immensely superior to the other lot—because she does 
move on—the rest of the British journalists in Paris beat your French 
ditto into fits as far as imbecility goes. 
The wise men of Cette appear to be quite up to our Krähwinkler and 
Schildbürger}' If Senegas has retired, Paul would be deputy. 465 If they 
had not put up Senegas—they inside or outside the town—Senegas (who 
seems to be a worthy descendant of Seneca) would never have been in a 
position not to retire.

Glad to learn that the barometer is rising again with our French 
friends—it is sure to rise more than it ought, but that we are used to and 
cannot be avoided; how else could the proper average be restored. 
Kautsky is in London and has been in possession of Paul's letter, etc., 
for about a fortnight, I will tell him tomorrow that Paul expects news 
from him. 
Your pears are gradually being eaten up, but we keep them religiously 
until at their best, and then I get most of them for my breakfast. Nim has 
just discovered that the long-shaped ones are sold here at 5d a piece 
today. Nim has what my poor wife 3 called 'a gammy leg', rheumatism 
(articular) wandering from knee to hip and back. That of course is a most 
variable quantity though not, unfortunately, une quantité négligeable}' 
The asthma will become less whenever the weather allows me to take her 
out a bit to Hampstead. Gumpert told her hill-climbing would mend it 
and so it does. 
Pumps and Co are still here—if a settlement is come to today, they 
will go back to Kilburn on Monday. The family of Percy has been forced 
to fork out a bit, but the job will cost me some 60 pounds at least, and 
then fully half their keep. Percy works for his brother Charlie who has 
some inventions that seem just now to suit the British philistines, but the 
pay is but trifling, and the whole thing uncertain. 
The 4th edition Vol. Ie is in the press and I am back to my Vol. III. 
No easy job, but mun be done as they say in Lancashire. 
Tussy is hard at work—tomorrow she won't be here at all, having two 
speeches afternoon and evening, so she won't get her cheque before 
Monday. Yours is enclosed, also the account—your share unfortunately 
but £1.17.6, but then in francs it looks much bigger. 
We have got hold of another Mother Schack in Miss Harkness. But 
this time we have nailed her, and she will find out whom she has to deal 
with. 
Ever yours

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 18 November 1889 
My dear Lafargue, 
Herewith cheque for £20. 
If the editors of your newspapers do not understand foreign 
languages, it would be sensible for them to send out their papers, with­
out the others (the foreigners) having to reciprocate with what is, for the 
French, incomprehensible gibberish. But I can't see that this would be 
any reason for the French not to send their papers to people who can 
read them and who are more than willing to make use of them in the 
interests of the French Party. 
The Pumpses are still here and it is hoped that things will be settled 
today. 
Last night I read Laura's translation of the Sénateur 3- to some friends. 
Everyone was delighted. That ought to be printed, Aveling said—But 
where? I asked—in the Pall Mall Gazette}—whereupon Aveling's face 
assumed almost unlimited vertical dimensions. 
Suppose Laura was to set about translating some of Heine's  stuff— 
next time she comes over here she could go to the British Museum, 
compare the translations that have already appeared, and choose some 
different piece—it might be possible to do something with it over here. 
Heine is fashionable at the moment and the translations are so British! 
Give Laura a kiss from Nim and myself— Nim is pretty fit. 
Yours ever,

ENGELS TO JULES GUESDE 
IN PARIS 
London, 20 November 1889, 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
Dear Citizen Guesde, 
I have just had a letter from Mrs Aveling who asks me to write to you 
if I should happen to have your address. Luckily it had been given me 
by Bonnier and hence I am doing so without delay. The case is as 
follows: 
In Silvertown, a London suburb, Mrs Aveling is conducting a strike549 
in Messrs Silver's works where rubber goods, etc., are produced. The 
strike, in which three thousand working men and women are involved, 
has been going on for ten weeks and has every prospect of success. That 
it should succeed is important, for its failure would mean the interrup­
tion of the long series of successes scored by the workers since the dock 
strike,489 and would spell victory for the English employers whose 
rapidly dwindling confidence would thus be restored. 
A few days ago, the Silver company received very urgent orders they 
would not possibly be able to carry out with 3,000 out of their 3,500 
work people on strike. Furthermore, there was an order for a consider­
able quantity of submarine cables, which was to be shared out between 
four factories, among them Silver's. They will miss their chance, if the 
strike continues. They made tempting offers to some of the strikers, but 
to no avail. They then played their last card. 
Messrs Silver (a joint stock company which operates under that name) 
owns a similar establishment at Beaumont-Persan near Paris, where 
Frenchmen work under English foremen. Some of them were brought 
over to England. It is known for certain that 70 working men and 
women from Beaumont have arrived at the docks, but whether they have 
been introduced into the Silvertown factory is not yet known. It is now 
imperative that a stop be put to this. They were probably induced to 
come over under false pretences, without having been told that it was 
because of a strike. 
Mrs Aveling at once telegraphed to Lafargue and Vaillant but, the 
matter being urgent, we are also addressing ourselves to you, with the 

=====第423页=====
412 Letters -1889 
request that you do everything in your power to prevent the French 
workers from coming to replace the Silvertown strikers, and that you 
make known the true situation, thus calling upon the class feeling of 
your workers. It would be frightful were the strikers' resistance to be 
broken by the arrival of a number of French Blacklegs. There would be 
a revival of old national animosities and no means of suppressing them. 
For the past four months the workers of London's East End have not 
only given themselves to the movement body and soul; they have also 
provided, for their comrades in all other countries, an example of disci­
pline, self-sacrifice, courage and perseverance equalled only by the 
Parisians when under siege from the Prussians.550 Just imagine what the 
effect would be if now, in the midst of the struggle, they were to find 
French workers fighting under the standard of the English bourgeoisie! 
No, that is unthinkable! Only let the true situation be known in France 
and it will, on the contrary, be thanks to the action of the French prole­
tariat that the English strikers will achieve victory. 
When, during the dock strike, we sent Anseele a telegram informing 
him that the employers were bringing in Belgian workmen, he immedi­
ately took the necessary action and his letters and telegrams went a long 
way towards reviving the sometimes flagging spirits of the combatants. 
If you feel able to offer similar encouragement to the people of 
Silvertown, you should write direct to Mrs Aveling, 65 Chancery Lane, 
London, W. C, which would create an excellent impression. 
I hear from Bonnier that your health has greatly improved and that 
the Marseilles campaign551  has strengthened your constitution instead of 
weakening it. I am delighted, for we need every ounce of your energy. It 
is good news that your slogan 'Neither Ferry nor Boulanger' should 
have excluded the renegades and traitors of both these camps from the 
Socialist Workers' Party 552 in the Chamber. 
With cordial and fraternal greetings,

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER 554

Dear Adler, 
I suggest that you undertake a revision of Avenel's Cloots3 for the 
following reasons: 
a G. Avenel,  Anacharsis  Cloots:  d'orateur  du genre  humaine 

=====第425页=====
414 Letters-1889 
In my view (and Marx's) the book contains the first accurate account, 
based on a study of the records, to deal specifically with the critical epoch 
of the French Revolution, namely the time between 10 August and 9 
Thermidor. 555 
The Paris Commune364  and Cloots were in favour of a propaganda 
war as the only possible expedient, whereas the Comité de salut public 556 
went in for politics, was afraid of the European coalition and sought 
peace by dividing the members of that coalition. Danton wished for 
peace with England, in other words with Fox and the opposition party, 
which hoped to come to the helm at the elections. Robespierre was 
conducting intrigues in Basle with Austria and Prussia and wished to 
compound with those powers. Both joined forces against the Commune, 
primarily with the intention of overthrowing the men who wished for a 
propaganda war—the republicanisation of Europe. They succeeded and 
the Commune (Hébert, Cloots, etc.) had their heads cut off. From then 
on, however, no peace was possible between those who wanted to 
conclude peace only with Britain and those who wanted to conclude 
peace only with the German powers. The English elections turned out in 
favour of Pitt, which meant Fox's exclusion from power for years to 
come; as a result Danton's position was ruined, Robespierre emerged 
victorious and cut off Danton's head. But—and this was a point upon 
which Avenel didn't lay enough stress—whereas the reign of terror was 
now intensified beyond all reason, because indispensable if Robespierre 
was to remain at the helm in the conditions then obtaining in France, it 
was rendered wholly superfluous by the Fleurus victory of 26 June 
1794, 365 which not only liberated the frontiers but delivered up to France 
both Belgium and, indirectly, the left bank of the Rhine, whereby 
Robespierre was also rendered superfluous and fell on 28 July. 
The whole of the French Revolution is dominated by the war with the 
coalition, a war upon which its every pulsation depends.—Let the coali­
tion army advance into France, and the vagus takes over, the heart 
pounds, there's a revolutionary crisis. Let it be pushed back—and the 
sympathetic ganglion takes over, the heart slows down, reactionary 
elements again push themselves to the fore, the plebeians—the forerun­
ners of the later proletariat, thanks to whose energy alone the 
Revolution was saved—are restored to reason and order. 
The tragic thing about it was that the party of war à outrance, 3- of war 
for the liberation of the peoples, eventually turned out to be right, and 
a to the knife 

=====第426页=====
Letters -1889 415 
that the Republic successfully tackled the whole of Europe, but not until 
after that party had itself long since been decapitated, while instead of 
the propaganda war, there ensued the Peace of Basle557 and the bourgeois 
orgy of the Directory.558 
The book must be completely revised and abridged—the bombast 
must be excised, and the facts, having been supplemented from ordinary 
history books, made to stand out clearly. In the process Cloots can be 
completely relegated to the background; the most important things from 
the Lundis révolutionnaires can be interpolated 3—and in this way it can 
be made into a work on the Revolution such as has never existed before. 
The account of how the Battle of Fleuras precipitated the collapse of 
the reign of terror appeared in 1842 in the (first) Rheinische Zeitung, in 
an excellent review by C. F. Koppen of H. Leo's Geschichte der franzö­
sischen Revolution.™

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 563 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 7 December 1889 
Dear Sorge, 
Letters of 8 and 29 October received with thanks. 564 
That the 'Socialist Labor Party'3 might go into liquidation is too 
much to hope. Apart from Shevich, Rosenberg has other heirs in plenty, 
and the conceited, doctrinaire Germans out there will certainly not be 
anxious to give up their position as self-appointed tutors to the 'imma­
ture'  Americans. Otherwise they'd be complete nonentities. 
Here, too, we have seen that it's not so easy to educate a great nation 
in doctrinaire and dogmatic fashion, even if one is in possession of the 
best of theories deriving from that nation's own mode of existence, and 
has relatively better educators than those of the Socialist Labor Party. 
Now the movement has at last got going—as I believe for good. But it 
isn't actually socialist and those Englishmen who have understood our 
theory best remain outside it—Hyndman because he's an incorrigible 
intriguer and dog-in-the-manger, Bax because he's too much of an acad­
emic.  In form, the movement is first and foremost a trades union move­
ment, but totally different from the movement of the old Trades Unions, 
that of the skilled labourers or working men's aristocracy. The way the 
chaps are tackling the job now is altogether different; they are leading 
vastly greater masses into the fray, are convulsing society far more 
profoundly and making much more extensive demands—8-hour day, the 
universal federation of all organisations, complete solidarity. Thanks to 
Tussy, the Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union565 has, for the 
first time, got women's branches. Moreover, the chaps consider their 
present demands to be merely provisional, although they themselves 
don't yet know what their ultimate goal will be. But this obscure presen­
timent is deep-seated enough for them to choose only avowed socialists 
for their leaders. Like everyone else, they will have to learn by experi­
ence and from the consequences of their own mistakes. But it won't take 
them long since, unlike the old Trades Unions, they greet with derision 
any reference to an identity of interests between capital and labour. I 
hope there won't be any general elections for the next three years, 1. so

that Russia's minion, Gladstone, should not be at the helm at the time 
when the threat of war is greatest, this being alone sufficient to make the 
Tsara precipitate a war: 2. so that the anti-Conservative majority grows 
big enough to ensure genuine Home Rule for Ireland,175 for otherwise 
Gladstone will again play a dirty trick on the Irish and this obstacle—the 
Irish question—won't have been removed: 3. but also so that the labour 
movement can develop still further and, perhaps, mature more quickly 
as a result of the bad trading conditions that will surely come as a back­
lash of the present boom. Then the next parliament might boast between 
20 and 40 labour M.Rs, and they of a quite different calibre to your 
Potters, Cremers & Co. 
What is most repellent here is the workers' deeply ingrained sense of 
middle-class 'respectability'. The division of society into innumerable, 
incontestably recognised grades, each having its own pride but also an 
innate respect for its 'betters' and 'superiors', is so old and so firmly 
established that it's still pretty easy for the middle classes to practise their 
allurements. I am by no means sure that John Burns, for one, isn't 
secretly prouder of his popularity with Cardinal Manning, with the 
Lord Mayorb and with the middle classes generally than he is of his 
popularity with his own class. And Champion—an ex-subaltern—has 
always indulged in intrigue with middle-class, and notably 
Conservative, elements, preached socialism at the priest-ridden Church 
Congress, etc. And even Tom Mann, who to my mind is the best of the 
lot, likes to say that he's going to lunch with the Lord Mayor. You only 
have to compare them with the French to see what the benefits of a revo­
lution are. Incidentally, it won't greatly profit the middle classes if they 
do succeed in luring a few of the leaders into their web. By then the 
movement will be strong enough to cope with things of that kind.

For all his talent and good intentions, Bax is an unknown factor—an

somewhat thrown off balance as a result. Add to that his peculiar notion 
that nowadays it is men who are downtrodden by women. 
Your catalogue of the Tribune articles by Marx568 is doubtless buried 
under a mountain of unsorted letters. I have got the Tribune articles 
pasted in somewhere, but whether they are complete I can't say just 
now. I only came upon them again this autumn. 
Strictly between you and me, I have only just heard that, before leaving 
here,  Schlüter's wife apparently alleged that Kautsky had elbowed 
Schlüter out of his post. If she should say anything of the sort out there, 
there is no truth whatever in it. Schlüter resigned of his own accord and his 
resignation was accepted by the parliamentary group in Germany. 409 He 
had a personal quarrel with Motteler, with whom no one can get on, but 
who is of great value to the party leadership because of his absolute and 
universally acknowledged reliability in money matters. If on this occasion 
Schlüter didn't get from Ede Bernstein all the support he might have 
expected, the blame rested partly with Ede but also partly with Schlüter 
himself.  Our thoughts only turned to Kautsky as a replacement for 
Schlüter in the post of archivist 227 after Schlüter's resignation. I would not 
have bothered you with this tittle-tattle, but now feel obliged to do so. 
A fortnight ago a long letter arrived from Sam Moore. He finds the 
district salubrious, the situation very fine, and the company tolerable,

more proficient agitator than Bismarck, the miners of the Ruhr are 
certainly ours, those of the Saar soon will be, and the Elberfeld trial, with 
its revelations about mouchards 0 is also doing its bit. 569 In France our 
parliamentary group now numbers 8 men, amongst whom 5 of the dele­
gates to the Marxist congress in Paris473 , Guesde is their secretary and 
prepares their speeches for them. There is once more some prospect of a 
daily paper. The group is going to put forward as a motion the resolu­
tions taken by the congress. Everywhere work is under way for May 
Day 1890.—In Austria things are also going very well, Adler 0 has 
managed splendidly and the anarchists there are done for.

ENGELS TO CONRAD SCHMIDT 570

Dear Schmidt, 
Best thanks for your letter of 10 November. I am glad to hear that you 
are getting along so well in your journalistic career, only you should 
make sure you are properly paid, otherwise it's only half the battle. 
Journalism is a very useful training ground, particularly for us Germans 
since we all of us tend to be a bit clumsy (which is why the Jews are so 
'superior' to us in this sphere too); it makes one more flexible in every 
way, one gets to know and assess one's own abilities better and, above 
all, one learns to do a given piece of work in a given length of time. On 
the other hand, it can also lead to superficiality because shortage of time

accustoms one to dashing off things one knows one has not yet fully 
mastered. But someone like you with a scientific bent will nevertheless 
be able to preserve his powers of discrimination and not be tempted to 
place a dazzling tour de force, calculated for immediate effect and drawn 
exclusively from the handiest sources, on a par with a scientific work 
painstakingly produced if outwardly, perhaps, not so brilliant; although 
here too the cash forthcoming tends to be in inverse proportion to the 
actual value. 
Once you have made a position for yourself in journalism you ought 
to try and establish contacts that would enable you to return to London 
for a year or two. It's pretty well the only place that is any good for the 
study of political economy. Despite the great advances happily made by 
German industry during the past 25 years, we still lag behind others—in 
the customary manner—in this respect too. England has anticipated us 
in heavy goods, and France in fashion goods; for the export trade, as I 
once said in an article for the Paris Égalité, our industry could have 
recourse only to goods that 'étaient trop mesquins pour les Anglais ou 
trop vilains pour les  Français'.*  Hence, too, the remarkable phenomenon 
in Germany that the most notable feature of the present industrial boom 
is a drop in exports because, with the rise in internal consumption and 
thanks to protective tariffs, the manufacturers can sell more goods at 
home at monopolistic prices and are therefore having to sell fewer 
abroad at give-away prices. Hence all the economic phenomena there are 
manifested, firstly in a derivative form and, secondly, in a form vitiated 
by the protective tariff system, and are therefore always special instances 
nor, save as exceptions and after having been thoroughly purged of irrel-
evancies, can they be used to demonstrate the general laws and phases of 
development of capitalist production. Today, more than ever before, free 
trade has made England the classical field for the study of those laws and 
this all the more in that England, though in absolute terms still increas­
ing its production, is, in relative terms, definitely declining by compari­
son with other countries and rapidly becoming a Holland-type nation. 
However, the decline of British industry is, in my view, coincidental 
with the collapse of capitalist production generally. And whereas there 
can be little doubt that Germany will be the ground on which the strug­
gle will be fought out, it may well be in England that the issue is decided.

Which is why it's so splendid that here too, and at this particular 
juncture, the movement should have got under way in real earnest and, 
as I think, for good and all. The strata of working men who are now 
buckling to are infinitely more numerous, energetic and aware than the 
old Trades Unions, which represented only the aristocracy of the 
working class. They have far more drive. Whereas the old men still 
continue to believe in 'harmony', the young deride anyone who 
mentions an identity of interests between capital and labour. And 
whereas the old reject all socialists, the young refuse to have anyone at 
all except avowed socialists for their leaders. Here I have a splendid 
informant in the person of Tussy, who is deeply involved in the said 
movement. 
As I have already said, do try and come back here. You could risk it 
if you were to work as correspondent and do various other jobs for the 
Neue Zeit, Braun's Archiv and one or two other magazines. We should 
all—and I especially—be delighted to see you here again. 
Sam Moore is in Africa, in Asaba on the Niger, as Chief Justice to the 
territories of the Royal Niger Company. He left in the middle of June 
and writes very contentedly; he finds the region salubrious and the 
company tolerable. Sleeps sweetly, I hope, in a negress' arms. 
Otherwise everything here is much as it was. Aveling seems to be 
doing well with his dramatic endeavours—his last piece, a fortnight ago, 
was much liked. The Swiss expellees81 are gradually settling down. Time, 
a monthly controlled by Bax, will be appearing as from  1 January.b

ENGELS TO GERSON TRIER 571 
IN COPENHAGEN 
London, 18 December 1889 
[Draft] 
Dear Mr Trier, 
Many thanks for your interesting communication of the 8th.572 
Since you ask my opinion about the recent dramatic events in 
Copenhagen418 to which you fell victim, let me begin with one point 
upon which I am not of one mind with you. 
You reject on principle any kind of collaboration, however transient, 
with other parties. I am revolutionary enough not to deprive myself even 
of this recourse in circumstances in which it would be more to our 
advantage or at any rate do us least harm. 
That the proletariat cannot seize political power, which alone will 
open the doors to the new society, without violent revolution is some­
thing upon which we are both agreed. If the proletariat is to be strong 
enough to win on the crucial day, it is essential—and Marx and I have 
been advocating this ever since 1847—for it to constitute a party in its 
own right, distinct from and opposed to all the rest, one that is conscious 
of itself as a class party. 
This does not mean, however, that the said party cannot occasionally 
make use of other parties for its own ends. Nor does it mean that it 
cannot temporarily support other parties in promoting measures which 
are either of immediate advantage to the proletariat or spell progress in 
the direction of economic development or political freedom. I would 
support anyone in Germany who genuinely fought for the abolition of 
primogeniture573 and other feudal relics, of bureaucracy, protective 
tariffs, and Anti-Socialist Law52 and restrictions on the right of assembly 
and of association. If our German Party of Progress45 or your Danish 
Venstre418 were genuine radical-bourgeois parties and not just a miser­
able bunch of windbags who creep into their holes at the first threat 
uttered by Bismarck or Estrup, I would by no means unreservedly reject 
any kind of temporary collaboration with them having a specific end in 
view. When our deputies vote for a motion tabled by a different party— 
as they all too often have to do—even this could be described as a form 

=====第435页=====
424 Letters -1889 
of collaboration. But I would be in favour of it only if its immediate 
advantage to ourselves or to the country's historical progress towards 
economic and political revolution was instantly apparent and worth the 
effort. And provided the proletarian class character of the party were not 
jeopardised thereby. Thus far and no further I am prepared to go. You 
will find this policy propounded as early as 1847 in the Communist 
Manifesto*; we pursued it in 1848 in the International, everywhere. 
Disregarding the question of morality—a point I am not concerned 
with here and shall therefore not discuss—I would, as a revolutionary, 
countenance any means, the most violent but also what may seem the 
most moderate, that were conducive to the ends. 
Such a policy demands insight and strength of character, but what 
policy does not? It exposes us to the dangers of corruption, or so say the 
anarchists and friend Morris. Very well, if the working class is an assort­
ment of blockheads and weaklings and downright venal blackguards, 
then we might as well pack up at once, for in that case neither the prole­
tariat nor any of the rest of us would have any business to be in the polit­
ical arena at all. Like all other parties, the proletariat will be best taught 
by its own mistakes, and from those mistakes no one can wholly save it. 
In my opinion, therefore, you are wrong when you elevate what is 
primarily a question of tactics to the level of a question of principle. And 
so far as I'm concerned, the only question that confronts us at the start 
is a tactical one. A tactical error, however, may in certain circumstances, 
lead to an infringement of principle. 
And here, so far as I can judge, you are right in criticising the tactics 
of the Hovedbestyrelsen.h For years the Danish Leftc has been acting out 
an undignified comedy of opposition, nor does it ever tire of demon­
strating its own impotence to the world at large. It has long since missed 
the opportunity—if ever it had one—of avenging the infringement of the 
Constitution574 by force or arms; indeed, an ever increasing proportion 
of the Left would seem to be yearning for reconciliation with Estrup. A 
genuinely proletarian party could not, or so it seems to me, collaborate 
with a party of that kind without in the long run forfeiting its class char­
acter as a working men's party. Hence, in so far as you stress the class 
character of the movement as arguing against this policy, I can only agree 
with you.

Letters -1889 425 
Now as regards the methods adopted towards you and your friends 
by the Hovedbestyrelsen, such summary expulsion of an opposition 
from the party certainly occurred in the secret societies of  1840-51;  the 
very secrecy of the organisation made this inevitable. It also occurred— 
not infrequently—among the English Physical  Force  Chartists575 under 
the dictatorship of O'Connor. But the Chartists, being a party specifi­
cally organised for the use of force as their very name implies, were 
subject to dictatorship, and expulsion was an act of military discipline. 
On the other hand I have heard of no such high handed procedure in 
time of peace save in the case of the Lassalleans in J. B. von Schweitzer's 
'rigid organisation'; von Schweitzer had to make use of it because of his 
suspect dealings with the Berlin police, and in doing so only precipi­
tated the disorganisation of the General German Workers' 
Association.576 It would be most unlikely to occur to any of the social­
ist labour parties presently in existence—now that Mr Rosenberg has 
happily made himself scarce in America501—to treat along Danish lines 
an opposition it had nurtured in its own bosom. No party can live and 
prosper unless moderate and extreme tendencies grow up and even 
combat one another within its ranks, and one which expels the more 
extreme tendencies out of hand will merely promote their growth. The 
labour movement depends on mercilessly criticising existing society, 
criticism is the breath of life to it, so how can it itself avoid being criti­
cised or try and forbid discussion? Are we then asking that others 
concede us the right of free speech merely so that we may abolish it 
again within our own ranks? 
If you should wish to publish the whole of this letter, I should have 
no objection.

ENGELS TO NATALIE LIEBKNECHT 
IN LEIPZIG 
London, 24 December 1889 
Dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
First of all my most sincere thanks for the greetings you and your 
sona so kindly sent me on my last birthday, which was a most merry 
occasion. We all had to sit up until midnight so as to kill two birds with 
one stone, for the next day was Aveling's birthday and this we proceeded 
to celebrate together. 
We were glad to hear that you are all in the best of health. We, too, are 
getting on pretty well; Nimmi has had some bad colds and all of us have 
had attacks of rheumatism—not that it can be wholly avoided in this 
climate, but so long as it doesn't get too bad, no one complains about it. 
All is also well with the Roshers, except that last Sunday Papa Percy 
caught a bad cold which very nearly developed into pneumonia. 
However he's improving though it will, of course, put paid to any 
Christmas jollifications so far as he is concerned and he won't be allowed 
to leave the house tomorrow. At the moment Pumps is without a maid; 
the last one upped and left a fortnight ago while she and the children 
were out, and when Pumps returned she found the house deserted and 
locked and, since she had no key, the company had to come round to me 
and await Percy's arrival; until then they were unable to get in. So here 
too, you see, all kinds of petits  misères^ 1 keep cropping up. 
There will be a big party here tomorrow evening if Pumps and her chil­
dren are able to come; besides them, the Mottelers, Fischers and Bernsteins 
will be coming, as will the Avelings, of course, and then there'll be 
Schorlemmer, who has been here since yesterday. The number coming 
corresponds exactly to the number we can, at a pinch, find place for. 
Nimmi  is busy cooking and baking—the plum puddings were made  a week 
ago. It's an awful chore, with no purpose other than to bring on attacks of 
indigestion! But such is required by custom, and one has to conform. 
Nevertheless we'll make merry, even if we're sorry for it on Boxing Day.

Ever since the dock strike,489 when she worked day and night on the 
committee—the real executive work was done by 3 women—Tussy has 
been deeply involved in the strike movement. While the dock strike was 
on, a small strike broke out in Silvertown549 on the furthest outskirts of 
the East End, some 3,000 people. She was in the thick of it, organised a 
branch of the union for the girls and had to make her way there every 
morning—after 12 weeks, however, the strike ended in defeat. She is 
presently taking part in the gas strike in South London577 and on Sunday 
morning spoke in Hyde Park, but it isn't so exhausting, of course, and 
gives her more free time. She and Aveling will be taking on the assistant 
editorship of a monthly3 which has been acquired by E. B. Bax with 
effect from  1 January and that will be work enough in  itself.  Besides this 
she is secretary to two women's trade societies. 
I also got a letter from Liebknecht yesterday 578 and would ask you to 
be good enough to thank him for it on my  behalf.  He will doubtless be 
with you tomorrow. We over here are anxiously awaiting the verdict at 
the Elberfeld trial.569 I have long since lost all faith in the Prussian judi­
ciary and only trust that Bebel won't be convicted along with others. 
The people in Paris are, it seems, to have a daily paper again—but my 
hopes on this score have so often been dashed that I won't really believe 
it until I see it. Our French parliamentary group of eight men has not 
done at all badly up till now and has shown remarkable discipline when 
one considers that they have come together from all parts of France and 
are, to a great extent, strangers to one another. 
And now, dear Mrs Liebknecht, I should like to send my best wishes 
for a merry Christmas and a thoroughly enjoyable New Year to you, 
Liebknecht, Theodor and all the other children, not forgetting Mrs 
Geiser. I heard from the Schlüters yesterday; they seem to be getting on 
pretty well. 
With warm regards from Nimmi, the Roshers and myself

Dear Mrs Zadek, 
We were both, Lenchen and I, as surprised as we were delighted 
when we received the beautiful pieces of handwork you so kindly sent 
us. It was surely too much for you to have sat down, your eyes being 
as troublesome as they are (and I know what that means from my own 
experience), and made such complicated things. And for that reason 
they will be all the more treasured. Lenchen is in absolute raptures 
over her fine warm skirt and, even though you may have flattered me 
a shade too much in regard to the smallness of my feet, I'm perfectly 
sure that the slippers and I will, on longer acquaintance, become most 
intimate friends. We both of us thank you from the bottom of our 
hearts. 
I hope your health permitted you to spend a happy 70th birthday 
surrounded by your dear ones; may we please send you our belated 
congratulations? This distinction still lies ahead of Lenchen and 
myself—in my case it actually falls this year. It is a peculiar decade in 
which to enter it. 
With my kindest regards to you and Dr Zadek.

Percy is better, but Pumps is laid up with bronchitis and congested 
lungs,  will however be up soon. Charley R.a is the only one I know who 
can boast of having the influenza. 
Old Harney is laid up at Enfield with chronic bronchitis; I shall have to 
go some day this week and see him. Poor fellow, but he feels happy in one 
thing: being out of America1. It is most amusing to see how America makes 
all Englishmen patriotic, even Edward was not without a touch. And all on 
account of a quarrel about 'manners' and 'breeding'! The Yankees, too, 
have a rather provoking way of asking you how you like the country, what 
you think of it, and expect of course an outburst of admiration. And so 
poor old Harney has got so disgusted with the 'Land of the free' that his 
only wish is to be well back to the 'effete monarchy' and never to return to 
Yankeeland. I am afraid he will have his wish; bodily he is aging very much, 
no wonder after the eight years' torture with rheumatic gout he has had. 
But in spirit he is the old inveterate punster and full of humour. 
I was glad, on receiving Paul's letter about the new paper,581  that I had 
written to Bonnier my opinion that they ought formally to engage you 
on the rédaction for the German part. So he will see that I had no idea of 
the situation and at the same time considered it as self-understood that 
everybody got paid. He has not written again to me but to Tussy, saying 
the paper will come out 11th January, and wanting them to write and to 
get Burns, etc. to do the same. 
I really think you are about the only person who can keep his or her 
head above water and clear in Paris; that place seems to make people 
cracked. Here is Bonnier who was sensible enough as long as he was here 
and now all at once he is as mad as Guesde can be over this impossible

It strikes me this affair will end in all sorts of muddles, if not in quarrels 
amongst our own people at the moment when everything seemed to 
promise well. 
Anyhow I shall feel obliged and it will be useful to all of us if you or 
Paul will keep us well posted up with regard to this matter; for we shall 
surely be bombarded with all sorts of demands when once the paper is 
out, and experience shows that 'in the interest of the cause' one half of 
the facts are kept from us. Of course we shall be very shy in engaging 
ourselves, but at the same time it will be better if we have not in every 
case first to inquire from you how the matter really stands. 
I don't understand how Guesde can act in that way upon his own 
hook and let his meridional imagination run away without the consent 
of Paul, Deville and others. Bonnier's letters sound as if these people 
thought the whole world was idle, had more time on their hands than 
they knew to employ, and was anxiously waiting for the chance of a 
French paper coming out to which they might contribute gratis! Such 
things would not be suffered in the German or any other party—that 
one man engages the responsibility of all without a special mandate; that 
he acts upon delusions, as to the chances of his getting foreign contrib­
utors,  which you and Paul would have at once destroyed, or if you had 
a chance of refuting them, acts in spite of your better experience. Really 
if our friends will be guided by their delusion and fancies alone, nobody 
can prevent them from coming to  grief. 
I am called away suddenly and must conclude. 
Ever yours

ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS 
IN ENGELSKIRCHEN 
London, 9 January 1890 
Dear Hermann, 
Many thanks for your good wishes which, and this goes for you all, I 
heartily reciprocate. I'm glad to hear that you're all getting on so well and 
I, too, cannot complain. I put on weight again last year and am now back 
to 168 English lbs, which is about as heavy as I've ever been, though all 
of it is firm muscular flesh without any loose adipose tissue. My eyes are 
also improving; as a rule the foggy season, when the days are shortest, 
used to be the critical time during which they invariably got worse, but 
I've come through the present season in better shape than I've known for 
years and so there's a fair prospect of my being able to return to full-time 
work before long. Even the doctors won't believe me when I tell them 
I'm in my seventieth year; they say I look ten or fifteen years younger. Of 
course all this is simply on the surface and even in my own case may 
prove deceptive, for all kinds of minor ailments may be lurking under­
neath and over a period these many little things can add up to quite a lot, 
but all in all I can't complain and when I see how so many people make 
their lives an utter misery for nothing and less than nothing and to no 
purpose whatsoever, I can count myself lucky that I have retained my joie 
de vivre unimpaired and can laugh at such idiotic behaviour. 
But by now you will doubtless have heard enough about my 
esteemed person to last you for a long time and I too believe that it's high 
time I stopped. 
I duly got your circular about the boys and at once drank a hearty toast 
all on my own to the health of the new partners.582  It is very wise of you 
to have brought the boys into the partnership; after all, most of the work 
fell to them, as did most of the responsibility whenever the two of you were 
away from Engelskirchen, and it will give them quite a different incentive 
if their status in the firm corresponds to the work they do. I now advise 
you and  Rudolf 1 to devote as much as possible of your well-earned leisure 
to open air pursuits and, in summer, to travelling (you won't, I imagine, 
forget to go shooting in the autumn). Just you see how that sets you up.

I was notified by circular of Fritz Boelling's death (I was about to say 
August Boelling) and I think I heard about Fritz Osterroth in the same 
way. August Boelling may have been a pretty frail little chap, but he still 
managed to live to eighty, though no doubt he was careful not to overdo 
things towards the end. People like that can get away with it, while we, 
who enjoy better health, take on more and more work as we grow older, 
catch some beastly ailment and crack up as a result. That, however, is not 
altogether a bad thing, and also has its advantages. You at any rate will, 
in 2 or 3 years' time, reap the benefit of having reared your own doctor,3 
to whose care you can consign your body, thereby relieving yourself of 
any further responsibility in that respect also. 
I trust Emmab enjoyed the New Year's cake as much as I have the 
numerous German dainties I have been consuming during the past three 
weeks over and above the obligatory plum pudding, mince pies, etc. For 
we now have a gas stove, as our range has ceased to draw and the land­
lord hasn't installed a new one. This transition from difficult to easy 
cooking has put my old housekeeper0 into a real culinary frenzy and I 
must now eat my way through the fruits  thereof. 
Influenza, so-called, which, however, is said to be actually quite 
different from our old, familiar grippe, has also begun to take hold over 
here and a number of my acquaintances have already got it. An 
Englishman who came here for a meal last Sunday is in a state of such 
trepidation that he always keeps a bottle of ammoniated quinine in his 
pocket to drink from at table. May it do him good, but I'd rather have 
influenza than guzzle the bitter, evil-smelling stuff between meat and 
vegetables and spoil my good wine! 
So I trust that all of you will remain in good health and good spirits. 
My love to Emma, the children, Rudolf and family and  yourself. 
Ever yours, 
Friedrich

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER 583 
IN NEW YORK 
London, 11 January 1890 
Dear Schlüter, 
Warmest thanks for your and your wife's good wishes, most cordially 
reciprocated by all of us over here. I also received your letter of  1 July,584 
shortly after that date, likewise the Commonwealth with Marx as a 
gigantic tree and, all round it, the inhabitants of the new communist 
Jerusalem. Also the article about G. Weerth, but unfortunate only No. 1 
and not the final part. 
Now as for Reid, I have sent your letter to Tussy and asked her to 
make inquiries from Champion (Labour Elector), but haven't so far had 
an answer.585 The chaps over here are frightfully dilatory about anything 
with which they are not immediately concerned and are, besides, exceed­
ingly busy; Tussy may have something to tell me tomorrow, in which 
case I'll let you know by the next post. 
As regards the matter of John Burns' trip to America, this would seem 
to me highly problematical; he cannot really leave this country without 
making way for his rivals and he also has to be present on the County 
Council,451 since he is the only labour representative there. 
The movement's headlong progress last summer has slackened off a 
bit. And, best of all, the bourgeois rabble's mindless sympathy for the 
labour movement as manifested during the dockers' strike has also 
abated and is starting to give way to a far more natural feeling of mistrust 
and anxiety. During the gas strike in South London,577 which the Gas 
Company forcibly imposed on the workers, the latter have again been 
left completely in the lurch by the philistines. This is excellent, and I 
only hope that some day Burns will himself meet with a similar experi­
ence in a strike led by him, for in this respect he is subject to all manner 
of illusions. 
On top of that there is, as was only to be expected, all manner of fric­
tion, e.g. between gas workers and dockers. But despite all this the 
masses are in spate and there's no restraining them. The longer the tide 
is dammed back, the more violent the irruption will be when it comes. 
And these unskilled men are a very different proposition from the stick-

lers of the old Trades Unions; not a trace of the old formalist spirit, of 
the narrow guild outlook of, say, the engineers;586 on the contrary, a 
general call for the organisation of all Trades Unions into one brother­
hood and for an outright struggle with capital. During the dockers' 
strike, for instance, there were three engineers at the commercial docks 
who kept the steam-engine going. Burns and Mann—both are engineers 
themselves and Burns is on the Executive of the Amalgamated 
Engineers Trades Union—were asked to induce the men to leave, for in 
that case the cranes would be unable to work and the Dock Co. be 
forced to give way. The three engineers refused, nor did the engineers' 
Executive intervene—hence the long duration of the strike! Again, at 
the Silvertown Rubber Works—12 weeks' strike549 —the strike failed 
because of the engineers, who didn't join in, even doing labourers' work 
in contravention of their own union's rules! And why? In order to 'limit 
the supply of workers', these idiots have a rule whereby only those who 
have served a proper apprenticeship are admitted to their  UNION.  In 
this way they have created a host of competitors known as black-legs, 
who are no less skilled than themselves and who would like to join the 
union but are forced to remain black-legs because kept out by this 
pedantic regulation, which today has become quite meaningless. And 
because they knew that, both in the commercial docks and in 
Silvertown, they would immediately have been replaced by the said 
black-legs, they remained where they were, thus themselves becoming 
black-legs vis-à-vis the strikers. Therein you may see the difference: 
The new unions stick together—during the present gas strike, the 
sailors and (steamers') firemen, lightermen, coal carters, etc., are all 
standing shoulder to shoulder, but here again not the engineers, need­
less to say; they just carry on working! 
However, the old Trades Unions, the big self-opinionated ones, will 
soon be cut down to size; their mainstay, the London Trades Council,587 
is gradually being worsted by the new unions and, in 2 or 3 years at the 
most, the Trades Union Congress269 will itself have been revolutionised. 
Even at the next one your Broadhursts are going to get the shock of their 
lives. 
The main thing about your revolution in the American socialist tea­
cup is that you have killed off Rosenberg & Co.501 As such, the 
German party over there has got to go; it is proving the worst obsta­
cle. The American workers will come along all right but, just like the 
English, they will go their own way. You can't drum theory into them 
before the event, but they will soon light upon it as a result of their

own experience, their own blunders and the undesirable consequences 
thereof—and then it'll be all right. Independent peoples go their own 
way and the English and their offshoots are the most independent of 
all. Their insular, stubborn inflexibility may often be irritating but it 
also ensures that, once they have got going, they will finish what they 
have begun. 
I am pretty well and my eyesight has improved at last, but I'm not 
allowed to write for more than 3 hours a day (by daylight). Nim is also

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI 588 
IN BENEVENTO 
London, 13 January 1890 
Dear Friend, 
I have been deliberating the matter of the letter of introduction for 
Buenos Aires.* I cannot conceal what has happened from the comrades 
out there. In so far as I enjoy the workers' trust, this rests upon the 
assumption that what I tell them is the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth, no matter what the circumstances. 
If I were you, I would prefer not to have any such letter of recom­
mendation. The moment one person out there gets wind of your convic­
tion, a hundred others will get wind of it too, and notably those who 
would neither read nor give a rap for my testimonial. And then you 
would be no better off there than you were at home; your conviction 
would pursue you everywhere. Better a new life under a new name. You 
are young and, to judge by your photograph, strong—just take courage! 
But in order to take care of all eventualities, I enclose a document in 
which I say in your favour whatever can and may be said with a clear 
conscience. However, I would again advise you not to make use of it. 
This may render the struggle more arduous in the early days. But in the 
long run a complete break with the past cannot but make it easier. 
Well, you must be the best judge of what you ought to do. But I hope 
that none of this will be necessary and that the Court of Appeal will 
pronounce you innocent. 
Very sincerely yours, 
F. Engels

440 Letters- 1890 
Mr Pasquale Martignetti of Benevento (Italy) has corresponded with 
me regularly for some six years past. Under the most difficult circum­
stances and with great perseverance he has learned German so as to make 
German scientific socialism available to his compatriots in translation. 
He then proceeded to translate, first my Entwicklung des Sozialismus 
von der Utopia zur Wissenschaft* and later my Ursprung der Familie}' 
etc., into Italian and to publish the translations after they had been 
looked over by me. Unfavourable circumstances 232 prevented the publi­
cation of his translation of Marx's Kapital und Lohnarbeit? 
Mr Martignetti was employed as clerk in the Royal Notary's Office— 
a legal agency—in Benevento. There he was accused of embezzlement 
and this, or so it seems to me, simply by way of retaliation for his activ­
ities as a socialist writer; and Mr Martignetti was eventually sentenced to 
imprisonment by the Italian stipendiary magistrates of two courts. I 
have read neither the documents of the case nor the reports of the 
proceedings, but only the accused man's defence. However, I believe that 
he was wrongly convicted, and this for the following reasons: 
1. Because he was accused only as an accomplice of the chief defen­
dant; the said chief defendant, however, was acquitted whereas Mr 
Martignetti, who was allegedly only his abettor, was convicted. 
2. Because the sums alleged to have been embezzled were first stated 
to be over 10,000 francs but dwindled as the trial went on until finally 
only 500 fr. were said to have been embezzled. 
3. Because the Prefect of Benevento, a highly placed civil servant, was 
so convinced of his innocence that he employed him in his office after 
his dismissal from the Notary's Office and even while the trial was in 
progress. 
4. Again, because he was simply a clerk, no court funds passed 
through his hands, so that he could not very well have embezzled any. 
Whatever the outcome of his trial may be, Mr Martignetti will prob­
ably choose to leave Italy and seek out a new home for  himself.  If such 
be the case, I hereby authorise him to make use of this, my testimonial, 
in any way he thinks fit. Should he anywhere encounter German 
comrades to whom my opinion is not a matter of complete indifference, 
I would ask them to rest assured that the above is strictly in accordance 
a Socialism:  Utopian  and Scientific  - b Origin of the  Family  - c Wage Labour and 
Capital.  In the draft the ensuing sentence reads: 'By engaging in these activities, 
Mr Martignetti has done signal service to the labour movement, notably in 
furthering mutual understanding between Italian and German socialists.'

with the truth and that I have withheld nothing whatsoever. Should they 
be able to help him find a post in which he could earn an honest living 
and upon which he could found a new existence, they would be doing a 
kindness to a man who, in my opinion, has been prosecuted only 
because of his activities on behalf of the international labour movement.

And as soon as I had replied in the negative, you did terminate it. You 
can hardly deny, that if you intended to convey the idea that the engage­

better. But you now say there was no connection whatever between the 
two,  and of course I am bound to believe you.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 592 
IN BERLIN 
London, 23 January 1890 
Dear Bebel, 
Congratulations on the Elberfeld acquittal569  and no less on your bril­
liant handling of the case, which emerged quite clearly despite the bad 
reporting. It was no small thing to steer your way through it as you did, 
with a train of 90 accused, including a Röllinghof 593 and, no doubt, a 
number of other worthless elements: but I don't suppose that Mr Pinoff 
will ever want to see you confronting him from the dock again. So that 
chap is the ultimate of which the Prusso-German Public Prosecutor's 
Office is capable. He interprets the law just as Bismarck does the 
Constitution, i.e. as an undergraduate in a pub interprets the students' 
beer drinking ritual—the greater the uproar the better. It's enough to 
make a French—not to mention English—lawyer's hair stand on end. 
Today, no doubt, the Anti-Socialist Law will again be debated in 
Berlin.594  I think you are right when you say (in the Arbeiter-Zeitung 595) 

=====第455页=====
444 Letters -1890 
that, if Bismarck doesn't cop it from this Reichstag, he'll cop it from the 
next one; the ever-mounting tide of our votes will break the back of any 
and every bourgeois opposition. In this I do not see eye to eye with Ede. 
He and Kautsky—they both have something of a bent for 'higher poli­
tics'—believe that what we should aim for in the next elections is a 
majority hostile to the government. As though anything of the sort still 
existed among the bourgeois parties in Germany! The men of Progress45 
will disappear with the suspension of the Anti-Socialist Law; the bour­
geois elements among them will go over to the National Liberals,596 and 
the petty bourgeois and working men to us. That is why they will cry 
off every time it looks as though the Anti-Socialist Law might be thrown 
out. And in other respects also Bismarck will always obtain a majority; 
even though they may still show some tendency to bridle and jib in the 
first year, he'll talk them round in the second and they are, after all, safe 
from their constituents for the next 5 years! But if Bismarck goes off the 
rails or otherwise disqualifies  himself,  it doesn't really matter what sort 
of people (bourgeois, I mean, not Junkers) there are in the Reichstag; let 
the wind but shift and they are all equally capable of reviling their idols 
of yesterday. On this occasion, therefore, I can see absolutely no reason 
for not repaying the Progress people in kind for their infamous behav­
iour in 1887597 and bringing it home to them that if they exist at all, it is 
only by courtesy of ourselves. It was ParnelPs decision in 1886 to get the 
Irish in England to vote everywhere against the Liberals and for the 
Tories, i.e. to abandon the role of a tame Liberal electorate for the first 
time since 1880, which, in the space of 6 weeks, turned Gladstone and 
the Liberal leaders into Home Rulers.598 And if ever something is to be 
made of the men of Progress, this can only be done by showing them ad 
oculos*—in the second ballot—that they are dependent upon ourselves. 
I am looking forward enormously to the actual elections.595 For then 
our German working men will again show the world what finely 
tempered steel they are made of. It's possible that you'll have a new 
element in the Reichstag—labour representatives who are not as yet 
socialists. The movement amongst the miners435 will have given you an 
idea of the way in which the movement is progressing over here—a hith­
erto indifferent stratum of the working class, largely proof against agita­
tion, is being galvanised out of its lethargy by having to fight for its 
immediate interests and is virtually impelled into the movement by the 
a plainly

bourgeoisie and the government, which, in present circumstances and 
provided we don't insist on precipitating matters, means that they are 
impelled into our arms. It is much the same here, save that they have 
behind them, not a powerful socialist party, but only small cliques, at 
variance amongst themselves and for the most part led by ambitious 
men of letters or poetic dreamers. But here, too, things are proceeding 
inexorably and it is precisely these people, now coming over to us en 
masse, who will soon make short work of the cliques and create the 
unity that is needed.—In our case this new element lends added inter­
est to the elections. 
I have just received your Hamburg speech600 but shall not be able to 
read it till after luncheon. 
The French are making a collection for your election fund, though I 
doubt that very much will come of it; the point is that it's an interna­
tional gesture. 
Unless something unforeseen happens, peace would seem assured so 
far as this year is concerned—thanks to the tremendous advances in 
technology whereby every new gun, every new type of gunpowder, etc., 
is already obsolete even before it can be introduced into so much as one 
army, and thanks to the universal fear of unleashing these vast masses of 
men and powers of destruction, of which no one can say what their 
effect would be in practice. Thanks also to the French and the way they 
have dropped Boulanger, who was in the pay of Russia (they'd put 15 
million francs at his disposal), thereby eliminating all prospects of a 
restoration of the monarchy (that being the only purpose Boulanger was 
supposed to serve). But neither the Tsar a nor Russia's diplomats care to 
embark on anything they are not sure of attaining; an alliance with the 
Republic is to them too dubious—the Orléans would better suit their 
book. 601 Nor does the anti-Turkish campaign launched by Gladstone for 
the benefit of his Russian friends602 cut any ice here and, since Gladstone 
is not yet in office and the Tory government is decidedly pro-German, 
pro-Austrian and anti-Russian, the Little Father will have to bide his 
time.  But we are indeed sitting upon a live mine and a spark would be 
enough to set it off. 
Our people's Paris daily, already advertised by Liebknecht in German

Au fond, 3- not a bad thing. A genuinely American party is of far greater 
use to you and the world generally than the few pence you used to get, 
precisely because the so-called party over there was not a party but a 
sect, and a purely German sect at that, a branch on foreign soil of the 
German party and of its specifically Lassallean and outmoded elements 
in particular. But now the Rosenberg clique has been thrown out 501 and, 
with it, the greatest obstacle to the development and rise of a genuinely 
American party.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 604 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 8 February 1890 
Dear Sorge, 
Have got your letter of the 14th and 2 postcards re H. Schlüter. 
What we shall lose as a result of the official socialists in America going 
a Basically

over to the Nationalists503 is, to my mind, scarcely worth considering. If 
it meant the disintegration of the entire German Socialist Labor Party,3 
it would be a gain, but we're unlikely to be so fortunate. For, after all, 
the really useful elements will eventually come together again, doing so 
all the sooner for the rapid self-separation of the dross, and will be suffi­
cient, by reason of their superior theoretical insight and experience, to 
assume the leading role the moment events themselves set the American 
proletariat in motion. And then you will find that all your years of toil 
have not been in vain. 
The movement over there, just like the one in this country and now, 
too, in the mining districts of Germany, cannot be produced by exhor­
tation alone. It's the facts themselves that will have to bring all this home 
to the chaps, after which, however, things will move fast—fastest, of 
course, where an organised and theoretically educated section of the 
proletariat already exists, as in Germany. Today the coal miners belong 
to us, potentially and of necessity; in the Ruhr, the process is well under 
way, the Aachen and Saar Basins will follow, then Saxony, then Lower 
Silesia and, finally, the Wasserpolaken of Upper Silesia. 605 Considering 
our party's position in Germany, all that was needed to call forth an irre­
sistible movement was the impulse arising out of the miners' own living 
conditions. 
Over here the same thing is happening. The movement, which I now 
regard as irrepressible, arose out of the dock strike,489 out of the sheer 
necessity of their standing up for themselves. But here again the ground 
had been so well prepared by the various propaganda campaigns of the 
past eight years that the men, though not themselves socialists, refused 
to have any but socialists for their leaders. Now, without themselves 
being aware of it, they are adopting a theoretically correct course, they 
drift into it, and the movement is so vigorous that I believe it will 
survive, without undue damage, the inevitable blunders and the friction 
between the various trades unions and the leaders resulting therefrom. 
More about this below. 
And that, I think, is what will also happen in America. For now we 
know that it's not lectures that will convert the Schlewswig-Holsteiners 
and their successors in England and America;606 that stubborn and 
presumptuous breed have got to learn by bitter experience. They are 
doing so increasingly from year to year; but they are ultra-conservative 
precisely because America is so utterly bourgeois, has absolutely no 
feudal past and is therefore proud of its purely bourgeois system—and 
that is why only practice can ride them of their old, traditional, ragbag

of ideas. So if it's to be a mass movement it will have to begin with trades 
unions, etc., and each successive step will have to be forced on them by 
defeat. But once the first step beyond the bourgeois outlook has been 
made, then things will go ahead rapidly like everything else in America, 
where the natural momentum of the movement, as it gathers speed, will 
startle the Schleswig-Holstein Anglo-Saxons, normally so sluggish, into 
a semblance of life whereupon, by reason of its greater mobility, the 
foreign element in the nation will also prove its worth. The decay of the 
specifically German party, with its absurdly muddled theoretical 
notions, its corresponding arrogance and its Lassalleanism is, to my 
mind, a real blessing. Only when these separatist conspirators have been 
got out of the way can the fruits of your labours again become manifest. 
The Anti-Socialist Law 52 was a misfortune, not for Germany, but for 
America, whither it sent the last of the louts. While in that country, I was 
often surprised at encountering so many genuine examples of your lout, 
who flourishes out there but is extinct in Germany. 
Here we are having yet another storm in a tea cup. You will have seen 
the outcry in the Labour Elector on the subject of Parke,607  the assistant 
editor of the Star, who, in a local paper, and à propos the buggery scan­
dals among the aristocracy here, actually accused Lord Euston of paed­
erasty. It was a scurrilous article, but only in a personal sense, the matter 
being hardly a political one. But it caused a great scandal, the Star took 
it up and challenged Burns outright and Burns, instead of consulting the 
committee, disavowed Champion outright in the Star. There was a great 
rumpus on the committee of the Labour Elector, all of whose members 
were opposed to Champion but each of whom wishes to get into parlia­
ment and must look to his own particular interests; nothing, therefore, 
was decided, which may also have been because they had no power (last 
autumn Champion told Tussy that the paper belonged to the committee, 
he being merely a temporary editor, but I doubt whether that was really 
the entire truth)—in short, Burns and Bateman resigned from the 
committee on account of this affair (Burns also on account of the chau­
vinistic article on the Portuguese rumpus), 608 and this week the entire 
committee absented itself from the paper. Tussy, too, has now written off 
Champion, whom she used to provide with international items on 
France, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Scandinavia—(the crazy stuff 
about Spain, Portugal, Mexico, etc., is by Cunninghame-Graham, a very 
honest, very brave but very muddle-headed ex-ranchman). 
All that the case has proved, so far as I'm concerned, is that 
Champion did in fact accept Tory money and then, with the opening of

Parliament, found himself under an obligation to do something for the 
value received. The actual author of the articles is alleged to be our some­
time friend of The Hague, Maltman Barry, who is regarded over here as 
a Tory agent and of whom Jung, Hyndman, etc., tell marvellous if untrue 
stories of a cock-and-bull nature. But all these gentlemen are behaving 
stupidly, for Champion has utterly ruined himself in the process and, at 
a meeting of his own Labour Electoral Association,448 was shouted 
down and had to leave the platform under the protection of  2 policemen. 
Wonderful grist to Hyndman's mill, of course, but I believe both these 
gentlemen are finished for good. What happens next remains to be seen. 
But it will no more wreck the movement than did the defeat of the gas 
stokers in South London.577 The chaps were too cocky, everything had 
been made too easy for them, and at this juncture a few checks will do 
no harm. 
In Paris our people are still trying to bring a daily into being. The 
Possibilist Parti Ouvrier, a daily financed by the government, has 
perished; on n'a plus besoin de ces messieurs? 
Bax's Time is quite an ordinary, middle-class affair and he's terrified 
of making it socialist. Well, it can't carry on just as it is, but there is still 
no room here for  a purely socialist monthly, especially at 1/- a copy. As 
soon as there's anything interesting in it, I shall send it to you. 
Here too we have our Nationalists, the Fabians,176 a well-meaning 
gang of eddicated middle-class folk who have refuted Marx with Jevons' 
worthless vulgar economics215—so vulgar that you can make anything of 
it, including socialism. As in America, its chief object is to convert your 
bourgeois to socialism and so introduce the thing peacefully and consti­
tutionally. They have brought out a bulky tome on the subject, written 
by 7 authors.15 
I trust you are keeping well and the work is becoming easier as you 
grow accustomed to it. 
I am having the same trouble with Percy Rosher as you are with your 
Adolph,c  only more so. The laddie has got into such a hole with his 
mania for speculation that his family and I have had to compromise with 
his creditors, and now all he can do is try and find some position or 
other for  himself.  But it would be better not to mention this to the 
Schlüters, lest word of it gets back here.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN 
London, 17 February 1890 
Dear Bebel, 
Karl Kautsky says you are proposing to telegraph to me on the 
evening of the 20th such results as are known to you, and it occurred to 
me that I had better let you have some information about the night deliv­
ery service here so that you might not err through ignorance and we not 
get the telegram until the following morning after all. Ede, Fischer and 
Kautsky all take the view that it would be best to telegraph me, as they 
will all be here on Thursday evening and, I hope, also Julius.b 

=====第462页=====
Letters-1890 451 
Details below, as I am still awaiting the information. 
For the rest I cannot congratulate your people enough.  Yourself,  first 
of all, on the perspicacity with which, in your last-but-one Viennese 
letter, you smelt out William the Younger's edicts before they had been 
promulgated,609 and the whole lot of you not only on the splendid situ­
ation in which you have been placed by our opponents—never have 
things been so favourable on the eve of an election—but also on the new 
situation which is apparently about to arise in Germany. 
From the start I have thought that, because of his thirst for action qua 
efficient new broom, and because of his imperiousness that was bound 
sooner or later to clash with Bismarck's, William the Younger3 was better 
suited to the task of undermining the ostensibly stable system in 
Germany, destroying the philistines' faith in the government and stabil­
ity and causing a general state of confusion and uncertainty, than was 
even the 'noble' Frederickb  (of whom, by the way, I have here seen a 
photograph in which he has exactly the same shifty, hereditary, 
Hohenzollern expression as his half-uncle Willich, son of Prince August, 
Frederick William IFs brother). But I couldn't have expected that he 
would attend to this with such promptitude and brilliance as he has 
done. The man is worth more than his weight in gold to us; he need fear 
no attempts on his life, for shooting him would not only be a crime but 
a colossal blunder. If the worst comes to the worst, we ought to provide 
him with a bodyguard against anarchist assininities. 
As I see it, the position is as follows: The Christian Social 
Conservatives have got the whip hand with young William and, since 
Bismarck can do nothing to prevent this, he is giving the laddie a free 
rein in the hope that he will get himself into a thorough fix, at which time 
he, Bismarck, will step into the breach as guardian angel and thereafter 
be safe from any relapse. Hence Bismarck hopes for the worst possible 
Reichstag, which would soon be ripe for dissolution, thus enabling him 
once again to invoke the philistines' fear of the threat posed by the 
labour movement. 
But here there is one thing Bismarck has forgotten, namely that, from 
the moment the philistine becomes aware of the discord between old 
Bismarck and young William, the aforesaid philistine will become an 
unknown quantity so far as Bismarck is concerned. The philistine will 
still be afraid, more so even than now, if only because he won't know 
a William II - b Frederick III 

=====第463页=====
452 Letters-1S90 
whom to look to for support. For now their own fear will drive the 
cowardly herd, not together, but apart. Confidence will have been lost, 
never to return in the same form as before. 
From now on all Bismarck's expedients will avail him less and less. He 
wants to avenge himself on the National Liberals for having thrown out 
his expulsion clause.610 In so doing he will kick away his last, feeble 
prop.  He wants to bring the Centre44 over onto his side, and in so doing 
will dissolve the Centre. The Catholic Junkers ardently desire to ally 
themselves with the Prussian Junkers, but the day that alliance is sealed 
the Catholic peasants and workers (on the Rhine the bourgeoisie is 
predominantly Protestant) will cease to be of any use. This breakup of 
the Centre will benefit no one so much as ourselves; for Germany it is, 
on a small scale, what the agreement over nationalities was for Austria 
on a large one—the elimination of the last party structure not resting 
upon a purely economic basis, in other words, an important factor in the 
process of clarification, a setting free of labour elements hitherto ideo­
logically enslaved. 
The philistine can no longer put his faith in little Willie because he is 
doing things which the philistine necessarily regards as foolish pranks; 
he can no longer put his faith in Bismarck because he sees that it's all up 
with his (B's) omnipotence. 
What will come of this confusion, seeing how craven our bourgeoisie 
is, we cannot possibly say. At all events the old order has been smashed 
for good and can no more be resuscitated than an extinct species. Things 
are livening up again, and that's all we require. At first you will be better 
off, but it's worth considering whether Puttkamer's prediction of a 
greater state of emergency611 might not eventually be realised. That too 
would be a step forward—the last, the very last panacea—pretty fright­
ful for you while it lasted, but beyond all doubt heralding our victory. 
Before then, however, a great deal of water will have flowed down the 
Rhine. 
Since conditions for the elections are favourable to a degree we could 
never have hoped for, my only fear is that we shall obtain too many seats. 
Every other party in the Reichstag can have as many jackasses and allow 
them to perpetrate as many blunders as it can afford to pay for, and 
nobody gives a damn, whereas we, if we are not to be held cheap, must 
have nothing but heroes and men of genius. Well, the fact is that we are 
becoming a great party and must learn to take the consequences. 
In Paris the Boulangists have scored yet another victory.137 It's all to 
the good. Paris has been greatly spoiled by the sybaritism of the many 

=====第464页=====
Letters- 1890 453 
novices in this sphere and by a chauvinism (not only the general French 
variety, but the specifically Parisian) that is based on the city's great past; 
the workers are either Possibilists19 or Boulangists or Radicals—and the 
more the provinces thrive, as they are doing by comparison with Paris, 
the better we shall progress. The provinces have spoiled many a move­
ment set in train by Paris; Paris will never spoil a movement emanating 
from the provinces. 
Well, as regards telegraphing, I shall write to the head office here to 
say that, this week, telegrams should be delivered to me at any hour of 
the night. But if your telegrams are to be of any use, they must arrive 
here before  1 o'clock in the morning. So if, on Thursday night, you tele­
graph before 11.30, that will leave 2Vi hours for transmission, allowing 
for the time difference; but not any later, as it wouldn't be much use. So 
11.30 p.m. on Thursday at the latest. Ede is going to arrange for 
telegrams to be sent to us direct from Berlin, Hamburg, and Elberfeld. 
But if you have no results to telegraph before 11.30 on Thursday, then 
it would be better to wait until about midday or 1 o'clock on Friday, 
when you are bound to know something, and perhaps again on Friday 
night at about 10 or  11; the latter would be desirable whatever happens. 
Further, only the names of towns where we have won or got into the 
second ballot. Where there are several constituencies in one town, I 
suggest the following: For Hamburg write Hbg, all  3 seats; for Hamburg 
one two, write Hbg I and II constituency. Again: All victories first, then 
all second ballots that we are in; e.g. thus,—victory Berlin four, five, six, 
Hamburg, Breslau one, Chemnitz, Leipzig Province, etc., second ballot 
Berlin three, Breslau two, Dresden one, Leipzig city, etc. If that's too 
long, then: Fifteen victories, seventeen second ballots, etc. And in the 
second telegram: So many victories all told and so, etc. second ballots. 
This will save money and time. 
Cordial regards and  1,200,000  votes.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 26 February 1890 
My dear Laura, 
Since last Thursday evening when the telegrams announcing victory 
came raining in here thick and fast, we are in a constant intoxication of 
triumph, brought, provisionally at least, to a climax this morning by the 
news that we had obtained  1,341,500  votes, 587,000 more than 3 years 
ago. And yet—next Saturday612 the orgy may begin again, for the stupe­
faction of all Germany at our success is so enormous, the hatred against 
the Kartell265 swindlers so intense, and the time for consideration so 
short that fresh successes, as unexpected as those of last Thursday, are 
quite possible, though I for one do not expect many of them. 
The 20th February 1890 is the opening day of the German revolution. 
It may be a couple of years yet until we see a decisive crisis, and it is not 
impossible that we have to pass through a temporary and severe defeat. 
But the old stability is gone for ever. That stability rested on the super­
stition that the triumvirate Bismarck, Moltke, William, was invincible 
and all-wise. Now William is gone and replaced by a conceited 
Gardelieutenant? Moltke is pensioned off, and Bismarck is very shaky 
in his saddle. At the very eve of this election, he and young William had 
a squabble over the latter's itching to play the working men's friend; 
Bismarck had to give way and took care to let the philistine know he had 
done so; he himself evidently wished for 'bad' elections, in order to give 
his master a lesson. Well, he has got more than he bargained for, and the 
two have made it up again for once. But that cannot last. The 'Second old 
Fritzb  only greater', cannot and will not stand leading by the chancellor's 
hand, 'in Preussen muss der König regieren' 0—this he takes au sérieux,^ 
and the more critical the time, the more divergent will be the views of 
these two rivals. One thing is certain to the philistine: the man he can 
trust is losing his power, and the man who holds the power, he cannot 
trust. Confidence is gone even among the bourgeoisie.

Letters -1890 455 
Now look at the state of parties. The Kartell265 has lost a million votes, 
has had 2Vi milliions for,  AV2  against  itself.  That ministry of Bismarck's 
parliamentary power has gone to smash, and all the King's horses and all 
the King's men cannot put Humpty Dumpty together again. To form a 
government majority, there are but two parties: the Catholics (centre44 ) 
and the Freisinnigen. 613 The latter, although already burning with the 
desire to form a fresh cartel, cannot do so—as yet at least—with the 
Conservatives, but only with the National Liberals, 596 and that gives no 
majority. The Centre? Bismarck reckons upon it, and the Catholic Junkers 
of that party are eager enough to unite with the old Prussian  Junkers.  But 
the sole raison d'être of the Centre is hatred of  Prussia,  and just you try 
and make a Prussian government party out of that! As soon as the Centre 
becomes anything like that, the Catholic peasantry—its force—break 
loose, while the 100,000 votes the Centre had less (against 1887) have been 
taken away by us in the Catholic towns, see Munich, Cologne, Mainz, etc. 
So this Reichstag is unmanageable. But Bismarck's last resource, a 
dissolution, will hardly help him. The confidence in the stability of things 
being gone, the supreme factor now is the discontent with the oppressive 
taxes and increasing dearness of living. That is the direct consequence of 
the fiscal and economic policy of the last 11 years, and by this Bismarck 
has driven the people right away into our arms. And Michel is rising 
against that policy. So the next Reichstag might even be worse. 
Unless—Bismarck and his master—on this point they will always 
agree—provoke riot and fighting and crush us before we are too strong, 
and then alter the constitution. That is evidently what we are drifting to, 
and the chief danger to be avoided. Our people, you have seen, keep 
excellent, wonderful discipline; but we may be forced to fight before we 
are fully prepared—and there is the danger. But when that comes on, 
there will be other chances in our favour.

in more peaceable times—also about Paul's articles.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 87 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 7 March, 1890 
My dear Lafargue, 
Election timea is over at last. Impossible to do anything amidst such a 
commotion, such comings and goings and perpetual running of errands. 
But never mind, for once it's all been worth while. Our working men 
have made the German Emperorb  travailler pour le roi de Prusse 0 and 
have sent the Gaulois reporter out to Le Perreux. 614 
The worthy William is first and foremost an emperor. One cannot, as 
you seem to suppose, send a Bismarck packing as simply as all that. Only 
give the quarrel time to come to a head. William can no more part 
company so abruptly from the man who compelled the younger man's 
grandfather^ to turn himself into a panjandrum, than can Bismarck from 
the same William whom he, Bismarck, has accustomed to seeing himself 
as a Frederick II2. But there is one thing, and one thing only, upon which 
both will be agreed, and that is to open fire on the Socialists at the earli­
est opportunity. On all other matters, divergence, and later on, an open 
breach. 
The 20th February marks the beginning of the revolution in 
Germany,e  and that is why it is our duty not to let ourselves be prema­
turely crushed. As yet only one soldier out of four or five is ours—on a 
war footing, maybe one in three. We are making headway in rural areas, 
witness the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and, more especially, in 
Mecklenburg, not to mention the eastern provinces of Prussia. 615 In 
three or four years' time we shall have won over the farm labourers and 
hired hands, in other words the staunchest supporters of the status quo, 
and then Prussia will cease to exist. That is why we must, for the time 
being, advocate lawful action, and not respond to the provocations they 
will lavish upon us. For short of a blood-letting, and a pretty rigorous 
one at that, there will be no saving either for William or Bismarck.

These two stalwarts, it is said, are in a blue funk and have no settled 
plan, while Bismarck is kept pretty busy combatting the innumerable 
court intrigues of which he is the object. 
The petit bourgeois parties will muster on common ground, namely 
fear of Socialists. But they are no longer the parties they were. The ice is 
cracking and will soon begin to break up. 
As for Russia, she will yet need many millions from France before she 
is fit to go to war. Her army is equipped with weapons that are 
completely out of date, and there is still some doubt as to whether 
Russian soldiers should or should not be issued with repeating rifles; the 
Russians are extremely steady when fighting in massed formations— 
which, however, is no longer done; as sharp-shooters they are useless 
and totally lacking in personal initiative. Besides, where find the officers 
for all these men in a country without a bourgeoisie? 
The April and May numbers of Die Neue Zeit and Time will carry 
articles of mine on Russian foreign policy. a We over here are trying to 
wean the English Liberals from Gladstone's Russophilia; the time is ripe, 
for the unheard-of cruelties perpetrated on political prisoners in 
Siberia616 have made it almost impossible for the Liberals to continue in 
this strain. Aren't they talking of it in France? But your bourgeoisie has 
grown almost as stupid and rotten as in Germany. 
As for Time, it is not a Socialist review, quite the contrary; Bax quails 
at the very thought of the word 'socialism' appearing in its pages. By not 
replying to his 'reply paid' telegram you have drawn down upon youself 
his sovereign displeasure. But it would be a mistake for you to take 
offence as he has done. Time could not carry an article signed Lafargue 
too often. Nor could it possibly take one that had appeared in the 
Nouvelle Revue}' just as Mme Adam would not take it if it had already 
appeared in Time. And as for an arrangement that would ensure simul­
taneous publication, would Mme Adam really lend herself to that? Do 
try and be reasonable. The article has been placed with her and in her 
company it will make a world tour. 
Aveling and Tussy intend to publish one article a month by a 
foreigner. The English public would stomach no more and, since you 
had had an article in the February number,0 this gave Bax an excuse to 
reject a second one, the more so since, a few months from now, nobody

will be talking about Huxley's attack on Rousseau. And all this, just 
because you failed to send the 'reply paid'! It's piffling, but that's Bax all 
over! 
Poor Laura! Let's hope she has no further dealings with Castelar. 
He's a man I find as repellent as I did the handsome Simon von Trier in 
1848 whose conversation was wholly made up of SCRAPS taken from 
Schiller and of whom the Frankfurt Jewesses, young and old, were all 
enamoured. Thank you for Iglesias's letter which I shall return in my 
next. The man Back is a German Russian from the Baltic provinces 
who,  some ten years ago in Geneva, used to bring out a Baltic review3 
(in German) and whom old Becker, for want of anyone better, 
attempted to convert to Socialism. He has also sent an article to 
Kautsky on the Spanish party he himself invented, but Kautsky gave me 
the MS without having printed it. What cheek—a Balto-pseudo-
Russian, putting himself at the head of a Spanish party consisting of 
three officers and no men! 
I had wanted to add something about Laura's dogs, but it's already 
five o'clock and the new GONG (a present from Aveling) is summon­
ing us to dinner. Between Laura and Nim, duty pulls in two directions, 
but my stomach joins in the fray and settles the matter. Nim might scold 
me, and Laura is far away. 
Good wishes to you both,

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN DRESDEN 
London, 9 March 1890 
Dear Liebknecht, 
My congratulations on the 42,000 votes that have made you the 
premier élu de l'Allemagne.* 617 When, in future, you are interrupted by 
a Kar-, Hell- or any other Junkerdorf b, your retort can be: 'It would take 
a dozen of the likes of you to muster as many constituents as I've got. So 
draw in your horns—if you can!'0 
After the prolonged intoxication of victory, we over here are sobering 
down by degrees, but without any unpleasant after-effects. I had hoped 
for 1,200,000  votes and everyone said I was unduly sanguine; now we see 
that my figure was too modest.618  Our lads have behaved quite magnifi­
cently, but it's no more than a beginning and they've got a hard fight 
ahead of them. Our successes in Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg and 
Pomerania d mean that we shall now be making tremendous headway 
amongst the agricultural labourers of the East. Now that the towns are 
ours and word of our victories has penetrated to the remotest baronial 
estates, we shall be able to kindle, in rural areas, a blaze of quite a differ­
ent order from the flash in the pan of 12 years ago. In three years the agri­
cultural labourers will be ours and with them the crack regiments of the 
Prussian army. Nor can this be prevented save by one means, the ruthless 
application of which is now the only point upon which little Williee and 
Bismarck are still agreed, namely a hail of shot to the inevitable accom­
paniment of an acute reign of terror. To this end, they will seize upon any 
pretext and, once Puttkamer's 'cannons'611 have sprayed the streets of a 
few big towns with shrapnel, there will be a state of siege throughout 
Germany, the philistine will return to his right mind again and vote 
blindly as directed, and we shall be crippled for years to come. 
a the first among the elected in Germany - b  A play on words in the original. 
Engels made up this word by analogy with the names of two Reichstag deputies 
-c A literal rendering of this German expression would  be: 'Withdraw into your 
foreskin, if you've got one.' -d See this volume, p.456 - e William II

This is something we must prevent. We must not, in our triumphal 
progress, allow ourselves to be diverted from our purpose, we must not 
spoil our own game or prevent our enemies from doing our work for us. 
So I agree with you to the extent of saying that, for the present, we 
should conduct ourselves as peacefully and constitutionally as possible 
and avoid every pretext for a clash. True, your philippics against the use 
of force in any form and under any circumstances seem to me inoppor­
tune,  firstly because none of your opponents would believe you, they 
are not as stupid as all that, and secondly because your theory would 
make anarchists even of Marx and  myself,  since we were never inclined, 
like good Quakers, to turn the other cheek. This time you have defi­
nitely overshot the mark somewhat. 
Nieuwenhuis is, to my mind, more or less innocent of the article to 
which you are replying;619 according to what we have heard over here, 
Croll is the crib-biter who refuses to leave you in peace—he's said to be 
a trouble-maker par excellence. These people from little countries are 
our bane in the international field—they are excessively demanding, 
expect always to be handled with kid gloves while themselves being as 
rude as they please, and constantly feel themselves slighted because they 
cannot always play first fiddle; all the trouble and strife at the last 
congress, both before and during it, was caused by them alone—first the 
Swiss with their deluded idea that they could get the Possibilists to 
defect, then the Brussels people, and after them the Dutch. Well, no 
doubt our German victory will put them more or less on the right track 
and enable us to be magnanimous. 
Will you please let me know in advance when you intend to cross the 
Channel. We've only got one spare room, and in the spring it is often 
occupied—as at Easter, for instance, by Schorlemmer, while the 
Lafargues or Louise Kautsky might also be coming; so a bit of manage­
ment may be necessary to keep it free for you. 
Since you specifically give a Dresden address, I can only take it as an 
indication that I should write to you there. 
The Nineteenth Century is, after The Contemporary Review, the most 
highly thought-of journal in this country—but since I am always confus­
ing the two, I shall not be able to provide details until later today when the 
Avelings have arrived. Meanwhile, I would simply say: 1. Get them to pay 
you well, 2. Under English law the article belongs to the journal and the 
editor can make what alterations he likes unless you have a prior agreement 
to the contrary. In such a case I stipulate, 1. that the copyright remains 
vested in me, 2. that no alterations are made without my  express  consent.

Evening. The Nineteenth Century belongs to Mr Knowles: Gladstone 
sometimes writes for it and for the Contemporary, which belongs to 
Percy Bunting, whom you were taken to see by la Schack. Otherwise I 
have nothing to add to the above. Knowles is every inch a businessman, 
so beware.

for personal details which no doubt they would be glad to give you. 
Other addresses we have not got. 
I will ask Tussy about that niece of Mohr's Paul has written about. I 
have not heard anything about her. Would be curious if you should turn 
out to be connected with little Abraham, vulgo Alexander, Weill! 
Things are getting serious in Germany. The Kreuz-Zeitung, ultra-
conservative, declares the Socialist law useless and bad! Well, we shall 
probably get rid of it, but Puttkamer's word will then become true: we 
shall have the major state of siège instead of the minor one, and cannons 
instead of expulsions. 611 Things go so well for us, we never dared to hope 
half so much, but, but, it will be stirring times and everything depends 
upon our men not allowing themselves to be provoked into riots. In three 
years we may have the agricultural labourer, the mainstay of Prussia, and 
then—feua! 
Ever yours 
F. E. 
We went to-day up to Highgate. Tussy had been already in the morn­
ing, planted Mohr's and your Mama's grave with crocus, primroses, 
hyacinths, etc. very beautifully. If Mohr had lived to see this!

ENGELS TO ANTONIO LABRIOLA 
IN ROME 
[Draft] 
London, 30 March 1890. Labriola. Dear Professor,—Please accept my 
thanks for the pamphlets you were so very good as to send me. I read the 
first, Del socialismo, with much interest and next week, when I hope to 
have some leisure, shall go carefully through the second one, that on the 
philosophy of history.3 This is a subject in which Marx and I had long 
taken a special interest. A new contribution from Vico's mother country 
and from a scholar conversant with our German philosophers calls for 
my fullest attention. I should like to take the liberty of sending you in 
return my little piece of Feuerbach.b 
I am also indebted to you for your kind endeavours on behalf of P. 
Martignetti, which have, I am glad to say, met with their first big success. 
I have been in correspondence with Mr Martignetti since 1884 and am 
morally convinced that he is innocent of the actions imputed to him and 
has fallen victim to a shabby intrigue. Perhaps, when you have occasion, 
you would convey to Mr Aw.c Lollini my most sincere thanks for his 
willing, able and successful defence of Martignetti. I trust that this 
magnanimous intervention on the part of you both will succeed in 
protecting him from undeserved vilification and ruin. 
You must forgive me for writing to you in German. Over the last few 
years,  however, my Italian, such as it is, has, alas, grown exceedingly 
rusty and I dare not mangle the Italian language in front of a master of 
that beautiful tongue. 
Very respectfully yours, 
F. E.

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI 
IN BENEVENTO620 
London, 30 March 1890 
Dear Friend, 
Herewith the letter to Labriola you asked for.a 
As to his terra libera,621 it is in fact altogether too much to expect of the 
present Italian government that it will allocate property in the colonies to 
small farmers for themselves to cultivate and not to monopolists, whether 
companies or individuals. Small-scale farming is the natural and best 
system for the colonies presently being founded by bourgeois govern­
ments, on which point cf Marx, Capital, Volume I, last chapter, 'The 
Modern Theory of Colonisation'.b So we socialists can, with a good 
conscience, support the introduction of the system of small farms into 
colonies that have already been founded. But whether this will be done is 
another question. All governments today are so much the creatures and 
hirelings of financiers and the stock exchange that there's nothing to stop 
the speculators themselves from gaining control of the colonies in order to 
exploit them, and no doubt that will also apply in Eritrea. But one can, 
after all, hit back, even if it's in the shape of a demand that the government 
should give the emigrant Italian farmers an assurance that they will enjoy 
the same advantages there as they seek and generally find in Buenos Aires. 
I can't discover from the Messaggero's article622 whether Labriola 
combines his demand with still further requirements, namely govern­
ment loans for emigrants to Eritrea, co-operatively run settlements, etc. 
Unfortunately I have absolutely no time to spare for revising the 
translation of Wage Labour and Capital.232 I have had some urgent jobs 
to do, and must now get back at once to Volume III of Capital before 
events in Germany take a revolutionary turn, as is very possible. 
Yours sincerely, 
F. Engels

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 1 April 1890 
Dear Kautsky, 
I have just received the Russian Sotsial-Demokrat and have compared 
my article* with the Neue Zeit. 62i I now find that Mr Dietz has had the 
impudence to alter without reference to ourselves various passages 
which he had not even scored in red. Not one of these passages infringes 
the penal code or contravenes the Anti-Socialist Law;52 they were, 
however, too strong for philistine tastes. 
Yet I have behaved as decently as possible and have done all I could 
to make the elimination of harmful matter easier for him. But censor­
ship of this kind, carried out behind my back, is something I won't 
stand for from any publisher. I shall therefore write to Dietz expressly 
forbidding him to print the remainder of the article in any form other 
than that in which it appears in the proof corrected by me, and by that 
I mean word for  word.  What else I shall do remains to be seen. At all 
events, Mr Dietz has made it impossible for me to send further contri­
butions to a periodical in which one is exposed to this kind of treat­
ment.

ENGELS TO JOHANN HEINRICH WILHELM DIETZ 
IN STUTTGART 
London, 1 April 1890 
To 
Mr J. H. W. Dietz, Stuttgart. 
I have just noticed that you have taken the liberty of making various 
alterations to my article on Russian policy* without the consent of myself 
or of the editors,b alterations which are wholly uncalled for, whether 
from the viewpoint of the penal code or of the Anti-Socialist Law. 
I have behaved as decently as possible towards you over this matter. 
I asked Kautsky to get you to score any passages that struck you as 
objectionable when you read the proofs. I in turn altered many of the 
scored passages and sent a request that if you felt further alterations to 
be advisable, you should write to us, stating your reasons. Since no more 
objections were forthcoming, I could only assume that the article would 
appear unaltered. 
Instead of that you have altered passages which you had not even 
scored. 
As it is not my habit to put up with this sort of thing from publish­
ers, / hereby forbid you to print the remainder of the article unless it 
agrees word for word with the proofs corrected by myself and I reserve 
the right to take any other steps I think fit. 
I need hardly say that in future I shall be careful not to write again for 
a periodical in which one is exposed to things of this nature. 
Yours very faithfully, 
F. Engels

ENGELS TO VERA ZASULICH 
IN MORNEX (FRANCE) 
London, 3 April 1890 
My dear Citizen, 
As soon as I got your letter,624 I let Stepniak have the rest of the arti­
cle (in proof) and, since part of it was slightly damaged, I added the 
corresponding MS for you to use as a check. I hope that by now it will 
already have reached you. 
Stepniak also gave me a copy of the Review, for which I thank you; 
I look forward keenly to reading your article and those of Plekhanov.625 
You are perfectly right; in a publication of this kind all the articles in 
any given number should be complete in themselves and quite indepen­
dent of any sequel in the ensuing number. Indeed, I should have acted on 
that principle had I not been pressed for time. 
That it is imperative to combat Narodisma, no matter where— 
whether German, French, English or Russian—I entirely agree. 
Nevertheless, I believe it would have been more fitting if what I felt 
impelled to say had been said by a Russian. Admittedly, the partition 
of Poland, for example, necessarily looks very different when seen 
from the Russian rather than the Polish standpoint, which last has 
become that of the West. But I must, after all, take equal account of 
Polish sentiment. If the Poles lay claim to territory which most 
Russians regard as inalienably theirs and as being Russian by national­
ity, it is not for me to decide between them. All I can say is that—or so 
it seems to me—it is for the populations concerned to decide their fate 
themselves, just as the Alsatians will have to choose for themselves 
between Germany and France. Unfortunately, in writing about 
Russian foreign policy and its effect on Europe, I found it impossible 
not to mention things which the present generation in Russia regards 
as 'internal affairs'a and the impropriety, or apparent impropriety, 
consists in its being a foreigner rather than a Russian who was thus 
holding forth. But that was unavoidable. 
a These words are in Russian in the original

If you think it might be of help to write a short note along these lines 
and to put my name to it, I should be glad if you would insert it wher­
ever you think fit. 
I hope that the publication of my article in English will make some 
impact. The faith of the Liberals in the CzarV liberating zeal has been 
severely shaken just now by the news from Siberia, by Kennan's 
book616 and by the recent unrest at Russian universities.626 That is why 
I hastened into print, so as to strike while the iron was hot. The diplo­
mats in St. Petersburg were counting on the advent of Gladstone, 
Czarophil and admirer of the 'DIVINE FIGURE OF THE NORTH', 
as he called Alexander III, to enable them to embark on their next 
campaign in the East. After the Cretans and Armenians had been 
unleashed, a diversion in Macedonia might have followed; with France 
in thrall to the Czar and a benevolent England, they might perhaps have 
risked yet another step forward, and even the seizure of Czaregrad,b 
without Germany's hazarding a war in such unfavourable circum­
stances. And, Czaregrad once captured, there would be hope of a long 
spell of chauvinist intoxication of the kind we experienced in Germany 
after 1866 and 1870.267 That is why the resurgence of anti-Czarist 
sentiment among the English Liberals seems to me so important to our 
cause; it is most fortunate that Stepniak should be here and thus able to 
fan the flames.627 
Now that a revolutionary movement is under way actually inside 
Russia, her foreign policy, once invincible, is suffering one setback after 
another. And that is highly desirable, for the said foreign policy is our 
most dangerous enemy, and not only ours, but yours. It is the only force 
to have remained unshaken up till now in Russia where the Czar is 
losing his hold even over the army, as evidenced by the numerous arrests 
of officers which prove that Russian officers in the matter of general 
intelligence and character, are infinitely superior to the Prussians. And as 
soon as you have partisans and loyal agents in the ranks of the foreign 
service—you or, come to that, the Constitutionals457—will have won 
hands down. 
Kind regards to Plekhanov, 
Yours very sincerely,

ENGELS TO FERDINAND DOMELA NIEUWENHUIS 
IN THE HAGUE 
London, 9 April 1890 
Dear Comrade, 
I fear that there is no chance of your son being taken on as an appren­
tice in an engineering workshop over here. Thirty or forty years ago, 
engineering firms used to engage apprentices of this kind and my 
brother 3 worked as such in Bury near Manchester for a year. He had to 
pay a premium of one hundred pounds sterling, was enrolled as an 
apprentice in the Engineers' Trades Union and in due course received 15 
shillings a week. But now that the continentals and especially the 
Germans are competing with the British in the engineering field, they 
have ceased by and large to accept any more foreigners as apprentices. I 
shall make further inquiries in Manchester and, if anything more hope­
ful comes to light, shall get in touch with you straight away. 
I'm glad to hear that things are also moving ahead briskly where you 
are; after the excitements of last summer a certain torpor has set in over 
here,  while at the same time the personal, local and other forms of fric­
tion inevitable in England are proliferating again to a greater extent than 
is desirable. However a practical people like the English and, for that 
very reason, one that is very terre à terrè° in its way of going about 
things, must eventually learn from its own mistakes; it's the only way 
here,  and then again the movement has already penetrated far too wide 
sections of the working class for it to be held up more than temporarily 
by all these squabbles. 
The third volume of Capital weighs heavily on my conscience; 
certain parts are in such a state that they won't be fit for publication 
until they have been carefully revised and to some extent rearranged 
and, as you may imagine when so imposing a work is at stake, I shan't 
do anything of the kind without the most mature reflection. Once the 
5th section is polished off, the two that follow will involve less work; 
the first four have to be read over, but apart from that are ready for the 
press.  If I could spend a year right away from the day-to-day affairs of

Dear Kautsky, 
A line or two in great haste before the post goes. First of all my hearti­
est congratulations on your engagement. You have been through a diffi­
cult time and to me this news is a sign that you've got over it, that you've 
put it behind you. May you find the happiness you expect. 
Schorlemmer and Nim also send you their sincerest congratulations. 
Thank you for your letter from Stuckart;a yesterday I also got one 
from Dietz, which I answered straight away, saying that I was entirely 
satisfied and also confirming that, as I had previously told you, I agree 
to a new edition of the Origin, etc.,b  as part of the Internationale

Now as to Dietz's plan to bring you to Stuckart, that is really a 
matter you must settle between the two of you. Schorlemmer and I 
were in Kentish Town 628 today, but Ede was out and so I doubt 
whether I shall be able to consult with him before Sunday. As for 
myself,  all I can say is that I should much prefer to have you here, but 
if your presence in Stuttgart629  is really necessary and you are never­
theless able to visit this country for a month or two each year, I must, 
for better or for worse, content myself with that. The Neue Zeit has 
become a stronghold which is worth defending to the utmost. And 
having an influence over Dietz's publishing business generally, which 
henceforth will be a more important lever in party life than was the 
case during the period of oppression, is also à considération.* To some 
extent, naturalisation and a secure berth in Germany can cut both 
ways,  since it means that you would be liable to be thrown out of 
Austria. And you are also familiar with dear Stuckart and its delights. 
I shall give the matter further thought to see whether there may not be 
some other, not immediately apparent, snags and talk it over with Ede 
on Sunday. 
However I wanted to get this line off to you straight away and it's 
now 5.25, ergo time for the post.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 12 April 1890 
Dear Sorge, 
Letter of 3-6 March received with thanks. The business of Miquel's 
letters 630 is not without considerable snags. 'Wilhelm' 3 would also like to 
have them, only to spring them on the world just at the wrong moment 
and thus deprive us for good of the hold we have over Miquel. For once 
the scandal had blown over, Miquel wouldn't give a fig for us. To me it 
seems far more important to keep some control over the chap by this 
means than to raise an unnecessary clamour as a result of which he 
would elude us and, what's more, have the pleasure of getting away 
unscathed. In any case everyone knows he was a member of the 
League. 531 
Again, my experience of the American press300  has been altogether 
too startling for me to fall for the bait. If someone on the Volkszeitung 
were to get wind of the fact that the afore mentioned letters were in 
America, none of those sensation-mongers would have a moment's rest 
or repose until they had got hold of them—nor would I willingly subject 
anyone to such torment and temptation. Besides, how am I to know 
how long Schlüter will remain with the Volkszeitung and whether they 
mightn't make the publication of the said letters a condition of his 
remaining? 
In short, I cannot possibly agree to this deal. 
In Germany everything's going better than we could have hoped in 
our wildest dreams. Young Williamb is positively mad—as if cut out, 
that is, for the task of thoroughly disrupting the old order, shattering 
what little confidence remains among the propertied classes as a whole— 
whether Junkers or bourgeois—and preparing the ground for us in a 
way even the liberal Frederick III could not have done. His sudden urge 
to be amiable to the workers—purely Bonapartist and demagogic but 
adulterated with muddled dreams of a divinely inspired princely

mission—makes no impression whatsoever on our chaps, something for 
which we have the Anti-Socialist Law to thank.52 Even in 1878 it might 
still have served some purpose, have created some confusion in our ranks; 
it could not possibly do so now. Our people have been all too keenly 
aware of the iron hand of Prussia. A few weaklings—as, for example, Mr 
Bios and, perhaps, some of the 700,000 who have come to us as new 
recruits during the past three years—might waver a bit in this respect, but 
they'll quickly be voted down and, before the year is out, we shall see 
William wondrously disappointed as regards his power over the workers, 
whereupon love will turn to rage, and cajolery to persecution. Hence our 
policy should be to avoid creating any disturbance until the expiry of the 
Anti-Socialist Law on 30 September; for by then the Reichstag will have 
dispersed completely, and to declare another state of emergency would 
scarcely be feasible. But once we have regained our ordinary rights as citi­
zens,  you should witness renewed expansion on a scale such as will put 
in the shade even that which took place on 20 February.599 
Since Little Willie's amiability towards the workers has as its counter­
part an urge for military dictatorship (this shows how the present gang of 
princes are all turning Bonapartist, nolens volens) and he is all set to shoot 
people down at the first sign of resistance, it's up to us to see that he does­
n't get the chance. As we found during the elections, we have made truly 
enormous headway in the country, particularly where, besides the big 
estates, there were, at most, big farmers, i.e. in the East. Three second 
ballots in Mecklenburg, 2 in Pomerania! The 85,000 votes that accrued 
between the first official count (1,342,000) and the second (1,427,000) all 
came from country districts where we were not expected to get any at all. 
Thus there is a prospect of our soon being able to capture the rural prole­
tariat of the eastern provinces and, with it,—the soldiers of the 'crack' 
Prussian regiments. That will bring down the old order with a vengeance, 
and we shall govern. But the Prussian generals would have to be greater 
fools than I suppose for them not to be just as much aware of this as we 
are, and so they must be dying to stage a ceremonial massacre and thus 
put us out of harm's way for a while. That, therefore, is our second reason 
for proceeding in an ostensibly peaceable manner. 
A third reason is that the electoral victory has gone to the heads of the 
masses—particularly in the case of new recruits—and they now believe 
themselves able to take everything by storm. Unless something is done 
to check this, all sorts of silly things will happen. And the bourgeois— 
vide the colliery owners—are doing all they can to encourage and 
provoke such silliness. For this they not only have their former reasons,

but also the additional one of hoping they may thus put paid to little 
Willie's 'amiability towards the workers'. 
I would ask you not to let Schlüter see the passages side-lined above. 
He tends to act impulsively and then, I know my Volkszeitung people— 
as journalists they ruthlessly seize upon anything that may be of  use.  But 
these matters must not get into the press, either out there or here, at least 
not into the German papers, and least of all as emanating from  myself. 
If, in the immediate future, therefore, our party in Germany should 
seem a trifle placatory—even as regards May Day—you will know the 
reason why. We are aware that the generals would gladly take advantage 
of May Day to do some shooting. In Vienna and Paris there is a similar 
intention. 
In the Arbeiter-Zeitung (Vienna), Bebel's contributions from 
Germany are of particular importance. I never make up my mind about 
any point relating to German party tactics before having read Bebel's 
views on the subject, either in the Arbeiter-Zeitung or in one of his 
letters. He is wonderfully perspicacious. It's a pity that only Germany is 
known to him from his own observation. This week's article, 
'Deutschland ohne Bismarck', is also by him. 
You will have had Time (sent a week ago today)3 containing my first 
article on Russian policy.b 
My nerves are settling down a bit now that I have turned almost 
teetotal; in fact, I shall have to go on restricting myself until the autumn. 
Schorlemmer is still a total abstainer. He and I send our cordial regards 
to you and your wife. He is staying here over Easter and will go back to 
Manchester on Monday. Sam Moore is getting on well in Africa;0 in a 
year's time he will be coming home on 6 months' leave.

ENGELS TO CONRAD SCHMIDT 
IN BERLIN 
London, 12 April 1890 
Dear Schmidt, 
I am precluded today by lack of time from replying save very briefly 
to your letters of 25.2 and 1.4, but as the second requires an early 
answer,631 I must get on with it today. 
I realised as much as a year ago that I should require help with 
Marx's mss. I therefore proposed that Ede—i.e. Bernstein—and 
Kautsky should assist me with these, needless to say not without remu­
neration, and both accepted. Well, so far I have had from Kautsky a 
copy of part of the ms. of Book IV, mentioned in the preface to Volume 
II632;  he has got quite adept at reading the handwriting and still devotes 
some of his spare time to this. Now there is, in fact, a possibility that he 
will be leaving London for good, i.e. at any rate for a few years, but in 
that case, as has already been agreed, his place will probably be taken by 
Ede,  particularly in view of the fact that, though his position might 
change should the Anti-Socialist Law52 expire and not be renewed, he 
might still not be able to return to Germany there and then. As things 
stand at present, therefore, I could not offer you any real prospect of 
work in this sphere; but in six months things can change a lot, and I 
shall be all the happier to bear your kind offer in mind in that I am 
anxious to familiarise as many properly qualified people as possible 
with Marx's handwriting—something that can't be done without teach­
ers, of whom I am the only one. For if I were to kick the bucket, as 
might happen any day, these mss. would otherwise be a book sealed 
with seven seals and would be subject to guesswork rather than a 
correct reading. So if a situation should arise in which I lost my present 
collaborators or otherwise obtained a free hand in this respect, I should 
at once apply to you and can only hope that you would then still feel 
inclined to accept; perhaps you will succeed in coming over here 
notwithstanding and, once you were in this country, much might easily 
be arranged which, from a distance, appears difficult. 
Our electoral victory3 was indeed astonishing and the success it 

=====第488页=====
Letters -1890 477 
scored in the outside world was no less glorious. Bismarck's victories 
may have earned  us—i.e.  the Germans generally—respect as soldiers, but 
have tended rather to diminish the respect for our personal characters 
qua Germans; the boot-licking of the bourgeois has seen to the rest: 
Germans fight well if well commanded, but commanded they must be— 
never any question of independence, of character, of ability to resist 
tyranny. Since the elections this has changed. People have seen that the 
German bourgeoisie and the Junkers do not constitute the German 
nation; the brilliant victory of the workers after 10 years of oppression, 
and while subject to that oppression, has impressed people more than 
Königgrätz and Sedan. 633 The world knows that it was we who over­
threw Bismarck, and the socialists of all countries are now aware that, 
like it or not, the movement's centre of gravity has shifted to Germany. 
Nor, after all I have experienced, am I at all afraid that our workers will 
not show themselves equal to this new position. The more recently 
recruited elements may not yet be sufficiently versed in the correct 
tactics, but that is something they will soon learn and, whatever is left 
undone by their older comrades-in-arms, the government will, in its 
wisdom, surely make good. The attitude adopted by the whole of our 
press towards the famous edicts609 shows how much spade-work the 
Anti-Socialist Law had done in this particular. Once bitten twice shy— 
and something which, in 1878, might for a time have had a somewhat 
disruptive effect, now cuts absolutely no ice whatever. I know that there 
are people, even within the new group,b who would gladly go half way 
to meet the amiability manifested towards the workers from on high, but 
they would be voted down as soon as they opened their mouths. 
Puttkamer was quite right—the Anti-Socialist Law has had an enormous 
'educative effect', but not in the way he supposed. 
Have you seen a review of your book by Achille Loria of Siena, c in 
Conrad's Jahrbücher} It was sent me from Italy—maybe indirectly by 
Loria  himself.  I know the said Loria; he was over here and he also corre­
sponded with Marx. He speaks German and writes it as in his article— 
that is to say, badly—and he is the most consummate careerist I have 
ever met. At one time he believed that world redemption lay in small-
scale peasant landownership, but whether he still does, I cannot say. He

writes one book after another and plagiarises with an effrontery that 
would not be possible outside Italy—even in Germany. For instance, a 
few years ago he wrote a little booka in which he proclaimed Marx's 
materialist conception of history as bis most recent discovery, and sent 
the thing to me\ When Marx died, he wrote and sent me an article1 * in 
which he maintained that, 1. Marx had based his theory of value on a 
sophism which he himself had recognised as such (un sofisma consa-
puto c) and 2. Marx had never written Book III of Capital, nor had he 
ever intended to write it, but had merely referred to it in order to pull 
everyone's legs, and knowing full well that the solutions he had 
promised were quite impossible! Despite all rebuffs and incivilities'1 I 
can never be quite sure that he will not again pester me with letters or 
packages; the chap's impertinence knows no bounds. 
Kind regards, 
Yours,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREUX 
London, 16 April 1890 
My dear Laura, 
At last! a free hour to write a line to you. I am pestered almost to 
death with letters, verbal and other applications of all sorts, and wish I 
could shut myself off for a month or so—for I find it impossible to reply 
to all my letters, much less to do any serious work. 
Many thanks for the kind wishes in your poem but I am afraid the 
Lord on high and the lord below will settle my hash for me some day 
and find me a place somewhere. But that need not trouble us now. 
And now a little business: 
1) Will you give me Longuet 's address? 
2) Will Paul procure me the title, publisher's name, etc. of a pocket 
edition (cheap) of the Code Napoléon 634 as at present in force, for Sam 
Moore? (les cinq codes suffiront, civil, procédure civile, pénal, procédure 
criminelle, de commerce 1) and price. 
3) Enclosed a bill found in last lot of French newspapers. 
The Parisian workmen are acting indeed as if they had but one purpose 
to live for, and that is to prove how utterly undeserved was their revolu­
tionary reputation. It's all very well for Paul to repeat over and over again 
that they are Boulangists out of pure opposition against the bour­
geoisie—but so were those who voted for Louis Bonaparte, and what 
would our Parisians say if the German workmen, to spite Bismarck and 
the bourgeoisie, threw themselves blindfold in the arms of young 
William? It is plainly cutting off your nose to spite your face, and the 
Parisians have still so much left of their former esprit that they can still 
back up the worst of all possible causes by the best of all possible reasons. 
No, the cause of this surfeit of Boulangism lies deeper. It is 
Chauvinism. The French Chauvins, after 1871, resolved that history 
should stand still until Alsace was reconquered. Everything was made 
subordinate to that. And our friends never had the courage to stand up 
a five statutes will suffice: civil, civil and penal procedure, criminal procedure and 
commerce 

=====第491页=====
480 Lette« -1890 
against this absurdity. There were fellows at the Citoyen and Qr'f who 
howled with the masses against everything German, no matter what, and 
our friends submitted to that. The consequences are there. The only 
excuse for Boulangism is la revanche, Alsace reconquered. What not one 
party in Paris ever dared to oppose, is it a wonder that the Parisian 
workmen now cling to as a gospel? 
But in spite of French patriots, history did not stand still—only 
France did, after the fall of McMahon.198 And the necessary consequence 
of this French patriotic aberration is that the French workmen are now 
the allies of the Czarb against not only Germany, but against the Russian 
workmen and revolutionists too! In order to preserve to Paris the posi­
tion of revolutionary centre, the revolution must be crushed in Russia, 
for how to reconquer, without the help of the Czar, the leading position 
belonging to Paris by right? 
If the desertion en masse to Boulanger of the French or rather 
Parisian workmen should cause socialists abroad to consider them as 
completely déchus? there would be no cause to be astonished. What else 
can they expect? 
Of course, I should not be so hasty in my judgment. This momentary 
aberration should not lead me to such a conclusion. But it is the third time 
that such an aberration recurs since 1789—the first time Napoleon No. I, 
the second time Napoleon No. 3 was carried to the top by that wave of 
aberration, and now it's a worse creature than either—but fortunately the 
force of the wave, too, is broken. Anyhow, we must apparently come to 
the conclusion that the negative side of the Parisian revolutionary charac­
ter—chauvinistic Bonapartism—is as essential to it as the positive side, and 
that after every great revolutionary effort, we may have a recrudescence of 
Bonapartism, of an appeal to a saviour who is to destroy the vile bourgeois 
qui ont escamoté la révolution et la république^ and in whose traps the 
naïfs ouvrierf have fallen—because, being Parisians, they know every­
thing from birth and by birth, and need not learn like vulgar mortals. 
So I shall welcome any revolutionary spurt the Parisians may favour 
us with, but shall expect them to be again volés 1 afterwards and then fly 
to a miracle-performing saviour. For action I hope and trust the Parisians 
to be as fit as ever, but if they claim to lead with regard to ideas, I shall 
say thank you.

By the bye Boulanger is so deep down now that the other day Frank 
Rosher who was in Jersey on business—a boy of 22, and the most 
conceited snob in London—called on him and was received courteously 
and both assured each other of their mutual bienveillance et  protection*] 
I hope the 1st of May will not disappoint the expectations of our 
French friends. If it turns out a success in Paris, it will be a heavy blow 
to the Possibilists and may mark the beginning of an awakening from 
Boulangism. The 1st May resolution was the best our congress took.473 
It proves our power all over the world, is a better revival of the 
International than all formal attempts at reorganization, and shows again 
which of the two congresses478 was representative. 
I am afraid I shall not be able to take one of your two dogs. The one 
is a bitch and Nim objects firmly to have again to do the massacre of the 
innocents, and the other is a pointer, id est a sporting dog, and there are 
most absurd laws here with regard to them—I could not take him out to 
Hampstead without being stopped by the police as a potential poacher; 
that is the reason why pointers, fox-hounds, setters, etc. are kept only for 
real sporting purposes and never, as with us on the continent, for private 
amusement. Voilà ce que c'est que de vivre dans un pays aristocratique}' 
In Germany we shall have to keep the 1st May as quiet as possible. The 
military has strict orders to interfere at once and not to wait for requisi­
tion from the civil authorities, and the secret police—on the point of being 
discharged—are straining every nerve to provoke a collision. In fact if the 
telegrams just to hand by Reuter are worth anything, they are beginning 
already and have found a few anarchists to provoke some 'outrages'. 
Nim says she can't come, her gardening days are over. She has 
rheumatism in the hip-joint—not much, but there it sticks. 
By the bye our Paris friends seem to go all to pieces. There is the Parti 
socialiste —a paper to work the Municipal elections, that I can conceive as a 
rational purpose. But then there is Okecki's Autonomie, and then a daily 
paper, the Combat in Boyer's hands, and now Guesde wants to organize a 
lithographic correspondence—why this looks like an attempt at 
gaspillage 0—they all cry after a daily paper and now they have one they 
don't seem to use it—or are they all at sixes and sevens? I cannot make it out.

ENGELS TO VERA ZASULICH 635 
IN MORNEX (FRANCE) 
London, 17 April 1890 
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. 
My dear Citizen, 
When I read Beck's article, I had a feeling it might anger you and your 
friends, and I told Bernstein that, in his place, I would not have 
published such twaddle. To this, his answer was that he felt he had no 
right to suppress an article which did, after all, express the views of a fair 
number of young Russians, people who had no other organ in which to 
reply, for the benefit of Sozialdemokrat readers, to the article which had 
preceded it, and that what he had chiefly in mind was to give you an 
opportunity to answer those criticisms; he added that he would natu­
rally, and with the greatest pleasure, print any reply you cared to send 
him. 636 
The position of the Sozialdemokrat vis-à-vis the Russians in the 
West is somewhat delicate. Needless to say, the paper looks upon you 
as the allies and particular friends of the German movement, but other 
socialist groups can also lay claim to some measure of consideration. If 
they are to communicate with German working men, they are more or 
less obliged to write to the Sozialdemokrat; should that paper refuse 
them its hospitality? To do so would be to meddle in the internal 
affairs of the Russians—something to be avoided at all costs. Consider 
the internal struggles of the French and Danish Socialists; for as long 
as it was able, i.e. so long as it was not itself called in question, the 

=====第496页=====
Letters -1890 483 
Sozialdemokrat maintained its neutrality vis-à-vis the Possibilitsts, 19 as 
it has continued to do vis-à-vis the two Danish parties, although its 
sympathies lie entirely with the 'revolutionary' side. 418 And the same 
thing applies to the Russians; Bernstein has never harboured any ill-
will whatsoever towards you, of that you may be assured, but he has 
an exaggerated sense of justice and equity; and rather than perpetrate 
one injustice against an enemy or a man he finds uncongenial, he will 
sooner perpetrate ten against his friends and allies; all his friends criti­
cise him for an impartiality so excessive that it ends up as bias against 
his allies. This is why he always tends to give the enemy the benefit of 
the doubt. 
Add to that the fact that we are all very much in the dark as regards 
the various, and far from immutable, groupings which occur among the 
Russians in the West, so that we are liable at any given moment to drop 
a brick. Bernstein is much better informed than I am, having had at least 
some first-hand experience of this kind of thing in Zurich, whereas I, on 
the contrary, did not know so much as the names, or even suspect the 
existence of the journals you cite.637 Bernstein tells me that, in Beck's 
letter, he detects the accents of Lavrov's followers—whether rightly or 
wrongly, I do not know—but this was one of the reasons which induced 
him to publish the letter. 
He also told me that he had arranged for a translation of Plekhanov's 
preface to be sent him from Paris so that he might print it in its entirety; 
it had arrived, he said, and would appear as soon as possible. He 
arranged this as soon as he got Beck's letter, which can only mean that 
he intended to take advantage of its publication to give Plekhanov 
another say. I would now suggest that you write a reply to Beck—in 
French, if you so wish—and send it to me or else direct to the 
Sozialdemokrat (address 4 Corinne Road, Tufnell Park, London N.). 
While you, for your part, may know the said Mr Beck who, outside 
Russian circles, is quite unknown, and while you may regard entering 
into debate with him as a somewhat demeaning occupation, this is, after 
all, the sort of unpleasantness to which one is all too often compelled to 
submit, as I am only too well aware. 
I know from experience what an upheaval is like when it takes place, 
as now, in the bosom of a small community of the Russians in the West. 
Everyone knows everyone else, having had with them personal relations 
of a friendly or hostile nature and, as a result, any development—accom­
panied as it inevitably is by divisions, schisms and controversies—will 
assume a wholly personal character. Such things are inherent in any 

=====第497页=====
484 Letters -1890 
political emigration, and we had our fill of them between 1849 and 1860. 
But what I also learned is that the first party to have the moral fibre to 
rise above that atmosphere of personalities, to refuse to let itself be 
dominated by the influence of such squabbles, will find itself in conse­
quence at a considerable advantage as compared with the rest. The less 
vulnerable you are to pinpricks of this kind, the better will you be able 
to preserve your strength and husband your time for the great struggle. 
Come to that, what harm can it do you if an article by Beck or by some­
one else appears in the Sozialdemokrat, provided you can be sure of 
being able to reply to it fairly and squarely? It would, after all, be impos­
sible to close the columns of the entire Socialist press in the West to your 
Russian adversaries; and it would surely be to the advantage of the 
Russian movement itself if it ran its course somewhat more openly 
before the wider public in the West, rather than covertly, in small, 
isolated circles which, for that very reason, become hotbeds of intrigue 
and conspiracy. To inveigle his adversaries out into the open, into the 
light of day, and to attack them in full view of the public, was one of 
Marx's most powerful and most frequently used ploys when confronted 
by clandestine intrigue. 
If you wish to rob your enemies of all desire to swagger in front of 
the German Socialists, your best way would be to contribute regularly 
to the Sozialdemokrat and the Neue Zeit. Once the identity of your 
views with those of the Germans has been thoroughly established and 
recognised, let the others say what they will—no one will heed them. I 
am sure that contributions from you would be welcomed with open 
arms,  and was delighted to hear that Plekhanov's article on 
Chernyshevsky was to appear in the Neue Zeit. 
My cordial regards to Plekhanov, as also to  yourself. 
Yours very sincerely, 
F. Engels 
Bernstein is an excellent chap as regards both intelligence and charac­
ter, but it is typical of him that the measure of the esteem in which he 
holds you should be the number of attacks he permits others to make 
upon you in the Sozialdemokrat; the greater his respect for you, the 
more anxious he is to appear impartial where you are concerned.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 237 
IN HOBOKEN 
London, 19 April 1890 
Dear Sorge, 
I get the Nationalist regularly but unfortunately there's not much in 
it. Just feeble reflections of our Fabians176 over here. Dreary and shallow 
as Dismal Swamp,63* but pleased as Punch about the magnanimous 
magnanimity with which they, eddicated middle-class folk, condescend 
to emancipate the workers who, however, are expected in return to be 
sweetly submissive and kowtow obediently to the eddicated cranks and 
their isms. Let them enjoy their little pleasure while they may; one fine 
day the movement will efface all this. Indeed, we continentals are at an 
advantage in that this sort of thing would not be possible in our case 
because of the very different effect the French Revolution has had on us. 
Today I am also sending you The People's Press, which, so far as 
reports on the new Trades Unions are concerned, has now taken the 
place of the Labour Elector. The latter, as you will have seen, no longer 
carries any factual news because the workers flatly refuse to have 
anything further to do with it. Not that this prevents Burns, Mann and 
others (particularly some of the dockers) from consorting a great deal 
with Champion on the sly and allowing themselves to be influenced by 
him. The People's Press is edited by a very youthful Fabian named Dell, 
the second in command being the parson Morris; both, from what I have 
heard so far, are decent people and most obliging to the gas workers. The 

=====第499页=====
486 Letters -1890 
(secret) leader of the gas workers is Tussy and the union is, to all appear­
ances at any rate, far and away the best of the lot.565 The dockers have 
been spoiled by the philistines' subventions and are anxious not to blot 
their copybook with the bourgeois public. Moreover, their secretary, 
Tillett, is the mortal enemy of the gas workers, whose secretary he vainly 
strove to become. The dockers and gas workers, large numbers of whom 
are dockers in the summer and gas workers in winter, really belong 
together; hence the latter proposed an agreement whereby anyone who 
was a member of one of the two Unions should not, on changing his job, 
be forced to join the other. So far this has been rejected by the dockers, 
who demand that a gas worker who turns docker in the spring should 
pay his joining fee and membership dues. Hence a lot of unpleasantness. 
Altogether the dockers are putting up with the hell of a lot from their 
Executive. The Gas Workers and General Labourers take in all the 
unskilled workers, and in Ireland the agricultural day labourers are also 
flocking to join it—to the annoyance of Davitt, who has progressed no 
further than Henry George and considers, though quite without reason, 
his domestic Irish policy to be threatened.639 Here in London, the gas 
workers south of the Thames have been thoroughly trounced by the 
South Metropolitan Gas Co.,577 that was all to the good, as they were 
getting altogether much too cocky and thought they could carry every­
thing before them; in Manchester they suffered a like fate and now they 
are calming down and starting to consolidate the organisation and fill its 
coffers. In the Union Tussy represents the girls and women of 
Silvertown (India Rubber, etc., Works) whose strike she led,549 and will 
probably soon take her seat on the London Trades Council.587 
In a country such as this, with an old political and labour movement, 
there will always be a vast accumulation of traditionally received rubbish 
to be gradually got rid of. There are the prejudices, all of which need to 
be broken down, of the skilled Unions—Engineers, Bricklayers, 
Carpenters, Joiners, Type Compositors, etc., the petty jealousies 
between individual trades which, fomented in word and deed by the 
leaders, are surreptitiously exacerbated to the point of outright enmity 
and strife; there are the incompatible ambitions and the intrigues of the 
leaders—this one wants to get into Parliament, so does that, the other

ary (which means here in England as with you in America, everything 
that's not confined to spouting hot air to the exclusion of everything 
else),  and the Federation,62 which continues to behave as if, except for 
itself,  there were nothing but fools and bunglers, even though the 
modicum of support it is regaining is due solely to the vigour of the new 
movement. In short, anyone who merely considered the surface of 
things would say that all was confusion and personal quarrels. But 
beneath the surface the movement continues, spreading to ever wider 
strata, for the most part precisely those at the very base of the hitherto 
inert masses, nor is the day far off when those masses will suddenly 
discover their identity, when it will dawn on them that it is they who are 
these vast dynamic masses and, on that day, short work will be made of 
all the shabby tricks and petty quarrels. 
Needless to say, the above details as to persons and momentary differ­
ences are solely for your own information and must not on any account 
be allowed to get into the Volkszeitung. Let this be understood once and 
for all—for when Schlüter was over here, he more than once demon­
strated a tendency to take this sort of thing rather too lightly. 
I much look forward to the First of May. In Germany the group in the 
Reichstag was duty-bound to restrain any excess of zeal. The bourgeois, 
the political police, whose 'bread and butter' is at stake, the worthy offi­
cers—all are itching for mayhem and slaughter and are seeking any 
pretext to persuade young William3 that it's never too soon to shoot. But 
this would completely ruin our game. First we have to get rid of the Anti-
Socialist Law,52 i.e. survive the 30th of September. And after that our 
prospects in Germany will be much too brilliant for us to wreck them 
merely for the sake of blowing our own trumpet. Come to that, the 
parliamentary group's proclamation640  is bad; it stems from Liebknecht 
and the nonsense about a 'general strike' was wholly unnecessary. But 
either way, our people have been so elated by the 20th of February 599 that 
a certain amount of restraint is necessary if blunders are to be avoided. 
In France the First of May might be a turning-point, for Paris at any 
rate, provided it helps to restore to their right minds the large numbers 
of working men who have gone over to Boulangism there. For this, our 
people have only themselves to blame. They have never had the courage 
to oppose the outcry against the Germans, qua Germans, and now in 
Paris they are falling victim to chauvinism. Luckily the position is better 
in the provinces. But abroad people look only to Paris.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE 
IN HOBOKEN641 
London, 30 April 1890 
Dear Sorge 
If, next Sunday, a gigantic demonstration for the eight hour day takes 
place here in London, this will be thanks only to Tussy and Aveling. 
Tussy represents her Silvertown working women on the council of the 
Gasworkers' and General Labourers' Union and enjoys so much popu­
larity on that Council that no one calls her anything but our mother. The 
gas workers—the best of the new Unions—were greatly in favour of the 
8 hours demonstration for, besides having fought for and secured an 8 
hour day for themselves, they had also learnt how insecure in practice is 
such an achievement, liable as it is to being reversed by the capitalists

Letters -1890 489 
at the first opportunity; for the gas workers as for the Miners, the main 
thing is that it should be legally established. 
Thus it was the gasworkers and the Bloomsbury Socialist Society642 
(the best section, which seceded from the Socialist League 2 years ago 
and of which Lessner, Tussy and Aveling are members) who initiated the 
thing, and obtained a strong following among the smaller Trades Unions 
and the Radical Clubs,22 which are increasingly splitting up into social­
ist working men's clubs and middle-class Gladstonian clubs. In all 
sincerity, they approached the London Trades Council587  and suggested 
they take part in the proposed demonstration in Hyde Park. That body 
(next year it, too, will be in our hands), consisting mainly of representa­
tives of the old skilled Trades Unions, realised that there was no avoid­
ing the thing and attempted to gain control of it by a coup de main. 
In collusion with the Social Democratic Federation62 (Hyndman), 
they applied to the Commissioner of Works and reserved Hyde Park for 
the 4th of May, something the others had as yet failed to do. For when­
ever a large meeting is to be held in the park, prior notice must be given 
to the Commissioner of Works, who then stipulates how many plat­
forms may be erected, etc. Since the regulations also prohibit the hold­
ing of any other meeting at the same time on the same day, these gentle­
men imagined they now had the upper hand and, having monopolised 
the park, would be able to order the original committee about.643 They 
had applied for 7 platforms, intending to allow the Social Democratic 
Federation to have two of them—thus, or so they thought, preserving a 
semblance of impartiality towards the socialists while at the same time 
gaining a socialist ally. 
Hence they decided that only Trades Societies, not political associa­
tions (thus excluding the clubs), were to parade with banners and 
provide speakers. They edited the resolution, omitting all mention of the 
legal 8 hours day and referring only to the 8 hours to be striven for by 
means of Trades Union action. Not till they had arranged the procession, 
the routes to be taken, etc., did they call a meeting of delegates—of 
Trades Societies only. When this took place, 1. Tussy was not admitted 
on the grounds that she was not herself employed in the calling she 
represented! (and yet Mr Shipton, the secretary of the Trades Council, 
hasn't done a hand's turn in his trade for 15 or 16 years!!) 2. An amend­
ment calling for the re-introduction of the legal 8 hours day into the 
resolution was not allowed to be put to the vote or debated—this matter 
having already been settledl 3. The delegates were given plainly to 
understand that the Trades Council was the man in possession, that the

Park was his for the 4th of May, and if they did not like it they could 
leave it alone. 
Much wrath and consternation among the delegates of the original 
committee. The following day the tables were turned, however. Aveling 
went to the commissioner of Works and told him that, unless the origi­
nal committee were simultaneously awarded a sufficient number of plat­
forms,  there would be a set-to; luckily the Tories are in power (the 
Liberals would have prevaricated and conceded nothing) and cannot 
afford to make any more enemies amongst the workers—Aveling was 
awarded seven platforms, and now it was the turn of the gentlemen on 
the Trades Council to eat humble pie, for a clash at this juncture would 
really have shown how weak they were. 
Our committee then buckled to, settling the details of its plans and of 
the routes to be taken by the procession—these it published forthwith— 
and thus was first to be ready. Yesterday Aveling and Shipton met and so 
arranged matters as to preclude all possibility of a clash, which means 
that Sunday's meeting will be one of the biggest there has ever been. 
You may get this published in the Volkszeitung and also in the 
Workmen's Advocate; I should be only too pleased if it were to come 
back to the gentlemen in English from America. 
I am now sending you a few Stars, which will be comprehensible to 
you in the light of the above (NB each article as a rule contains news 
emanating both from our side and from the other lot, in addition to that 
obtained by the reporters themselves, all of it lumped together indis­
criminately). 
Further, the May number of Time. Also a bundle of Combats 
(belongs to us, Guesde editor-in-chief) and with them the Vienna 
Arbeiter-Zeitung. The object of the threats of expulsion in Bebel's arti­
cle644 is Schippel—one of the chief intriguers and a great adept in sharp 
practice, whom Liebknecht discovered several years ago and introduced 
into the party but now mortally detests. Luckily Schippel is a  coward, 
like Hyndman. 
This is our first major victory in London and it shows that we now 
have the masses behind us in this country too. Four strong branches of 
the Social Democratic Federation, which is to have two platforms of its 
own, will be marching with us and are represented on our committee. 
The same applies to many of the skilled trades—the old, traditional lead­
ers side with Shipton and the Trades Council—the majority with us. The 
whole of the East End is on our side. The masses over here, though not 
yet socialist, are well on the way there and have already got to the stage

of wanting to have only socialist leaders. The Trades Council is the only 
labour organisation of note to be still anti-socialist but already includes 
a socialist minority and, the moment the gas workers—who so far have 
been kept at arm's length by all manner of little ruses—get into it, things 
will begin to move fast. I feel convinced that, after the 4th of May, the 
movement here will take on an altogether different character, and then 
you will hear more about Tussy's public activities. We have shown the 
intriguers of the Trades Council and the Social Democratic Federation 
that we are a match for their wiles and ruses and, much though the chaps 
hate us, they cannot deny the facts. The English proletariat would now 
at long last appear to be entering the movement en masse and, should 
this be the case, all the petty intrigues, swindlers and would-be bigwigs 
will, by this time next year, either have been relegated to the modest 
position that is their due or else swept away.

ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 
IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN 
London, 9 May 1890 
Dear Bebel, 
Thank you for your news from Zurich—I am glad that we should 
have arrived at the same opinion in regard to this point too.645 Your 
corroboration was of particular importance to me, the likes of us being 
so dependent in matters of this sort upon conclusions that are inade­
quately founded as to feel reluctant to use those unreliable conclusions 
as a basis for further inferences, let alone actions, without corroboration 
from an authoritative quarter. 
My hearty congratulations to you and your wife on your daughter's 
engagement.* The fact that it will eventually mean her emigrating to 
America is certainly most unpleasant for you, though for me it might 
have the agreeable consequence of our some day making a trip together 
across the Atlantic. What do you feel about it? I am firmly convinced 
that you would get over your sea-sickness within 2 or 3 days and quite 
possibly for good and all. And a sea voyage of that kind is an invaluable 
antidote to wear and tear—even now, almost two years later, I can still 
feel the beneficial effects of my jaunt. Moreover, Zadek claims to have 
discovered a sure remedy for sea-sickness (anti-pyrin is said to be excel­
lent) and, according to medical opinion, only 2 or  3 per cent of all human 
beings are unable to get used to the motion within 2 or 3 days. So 
consider the matter. 
If you find my articleb wanting in logic, the fault lies probably more 
with me than with Bios. To compress such a lengthy and complex matter 
into less than 2 printed sheets is a difficult feat and I am aware that there 
are all too many passages in which the thread gets lost and the reasoning 
is inadequate. In the event of my going into the subject—which is of the 
greatest importance to us—in rather more detail, some critical notes 
from you would be very welcome indeed just brief indications as to 
where you lost the thread and bow you think it got snarled up.

Letters -1890 493 
Well, no doubt the bourgeoisie will everywhere have had time enough 
to sweat out the fear inspired in them by the First of May and to wash 
the linen they dirtied in consequence. The Daily News correspondent in 
Berlin, one of the most vociferous Jeremiahs, complained on the First of 
May that the workers had made April fools of all and sundry, nor, until 
4 days later, did the truth dawn on him that, despite the workers having 
insistently declared beforehand that all they wanted was a peaceable 
demonstration, no one had believed them. 
You did perfectly right in so arranging things as to preclude the possi­
bility of clashes. After 20 February599 there is no longer any need for the 
German workers merely to kick up a row. Under the circumstances 
Germany was bound to make a more modest showing on the First of 
May than the others did, and no one thought the worse of you for that, 
either here or in France. But there is, I think, one lesson to be drawn 
from the Schippel business,646 namely the need to ensure that, next time 
there's an interregnum between the general elections and the convoca­
tion of the Reichstag, the leadership of the parliamentary group is either 
empowered to continue functioning as before, or is expressly reinstated 
in office by the newly elected representatives for the period of the inter­
regnum. It could then confidently intervene and also act, if necessary, 
while the gentlemen in Berlin, who would like to behave Paris-fashion, 
as though they were natural party leaders, would not be given the 
opportunity of throwing their weight about prematurely. Always 
providing that, after 1 October,52 the organisation stays as it is. 
Over here the demonstration on 4 May647 was quite overwhelming, as 
the entire bourgeois press actually had to admit. I was on platform 4 (a 
heavy goods waggon) and could only see part—a fifth, say, or an 
eighth—of the crowd, but it was one vast sea of faces, as far as the eye 
could reach. Between 250,000 and 300,000 people, about 3/4 of them 
demonstrating workers. Aveling, Lafargue and Stepniak spoke from my 
platform—I was just an onlooker. Lafargue, with his mixture of south­
ern vivacity and excellent English—if spoken with a strong French 
accent—elicited a storm of applause. So did Stepniak, while Ede, who 
was on the same platform as Tussy, was accorded a stunning reception. 
Each of the 7 platforms was 150 metres away from the next, the last ones 
being 150 metres from the edge of the park,a so that our meeting (the one 
in favour of international legal enforcement of an 8 hours working day) 
a Hyde Park 

=====第507页=====
494 Letters-1890 
occupied an area more than 1,200 metres in length and at least 400-500 
metres in breadth, the whole being absolutely jam-packed, while beyond 
it were the 6 platforms of the Trades Council587 and the 2 of the Social 
Democratic Federation,62 but with audiences barely half the size of ours. 
All in all, the biggest meeting that has ever been held here. 
And, what's more, a stunning victory, particularly for us. You will 
have read the details in Ede's report in the Volksblatt.MS The Trades 
Council and the Social Democratic Federation had, or so they thought, 
done us out of the park for that day, but they were bilked. Aveling 
persuaded the Commissioner of Public Works to allow us to have 7 plat­
forms in the park as well, though this was, in effect, contrary to regula­
tions.  But luckily the Tories were in power and he succeeded in intimi­
dating them by saying that our people would otherwise storm the other 
lot's platforms. And our meeting was the biggest, the best organised and 
the most enthusiastic. The vast majority here are already in favour of an 
eight hours law. Aveling and, even more so, Tussy organised the whole 
thing, and their position in the movement is now altogether different 
from what it was. The Union of Gasworkers and General 
Labourers565—by far the best of the new trade societies—supported 
them manfully nor, without them, would the thing have been possible. 
Now it behoves us to keep together the committee that organised our 
meeting—delegates of Trades Unions, and of radical and socialist 
clubs—and to make it the centre of the movement over here.643 The first 
moves towards this end will probably be made tonight. Of one thing we 
may be certain: the workers, the bourgeoisie, the heads of the old, rotten 
Trades Unions and of the many political and social sects and sub-sects, 
and the careerists, place-seekers and men of letters intent on exploiting 
the movement, are well aware that the real socialist mass movement 
began on the fourth of May. Now the masses are at last on the move and, 
after a few battles and a certain amount of wavering to and fro, will, just 
as it happened in Germany, put an end to the personal ambitions and 
attempts at exploitation of the careerists and to the rivalries of the sects, 
and will relegate every man to his proper place. And since an interna­
tional mentality will evolve very strongly in the process, you will soon 
discover what stuff your new allies are made of. All that the English do 
in the way of action, agitation or organisation shows that they are much 
more akin to us than the French, and once everything has got going 
along the right lines here and the internal friction, unavoidable at the 
start, has been overcome, you will be able to march alongside these 
people in truly fine style. What wouldn't I give for Marx to have

Have you had his letters  ? I shall send you the MS as soon as I get it. 
You would be well-advised to let him have another, non-suspect, address 
in Paris where he could send his letters for you, and also not to put your 
name to your own letters. That is what I do  myself,  and our correspon­
dence has never been interrupted by such mishaps. 
It's good that your Eight Hours Committee should continue to func­
tion—we are doing the same thing here, the Legal Eight Hour Day 
League is in process of formation, the Committee,643  in particular, will 
continue to function, and new societies (among them branches of the 
DOCKERS Union) are affiliating themselves. Since the question is a 
completely practical and straightforward one, it might, perhaps, bring 
back those of your adherents who defected to Boulanger's camp two 
years ago. By a strange quirk of history the Parisians, after having upset 
their digestions with grandiloquent phrases dubbed ideas, have now 
been reduced to a diet of 'DR RIDGE'S FOOD FOR INFANTS', the 
eight hour day, and suchlike easily digested  stuff. 
The end of the Boulangea is comic indeed. Having been given a kick by 
universal suffrage, the gallant general passes it on to his 'committee'653 so 
that there may be no intermediary between himself and universal suffrage! 
Rumour has it that Frank Rosher's visit gave him the coup de grâce. b 
After that, he could sink no lower.

500 Letters -mû 
statement yesterday, I found that they already had it there, in print in 
the Berliner Volksblatt. So Schlüter had sent it off before. That's what 
I call Schlüter's excess of zeal and what tends to be a bit embarrass­
ing to a chap like me when he turns up at a newspaper office with an 
allegedly brand new ms. only to find the thing has already appeared 
in another paper. Not that I've had any other indiscretions to 
complain of since he's been in America, but I know him from days of 
yore. 
I must now burden you with another piece of gossip about Schlüter 
which I would not otherwise have thought worth mentioning. But 
Motteler, a mortal enemy of Schlüter's, who was also responsible for 
Schlüter's leaving here, has recounted his version of the affair to Jonas 
and so it is necessary for you, at any rate, to know the true story. 
Motteler is a crib-biter of the first water and is very difficult to get on 
with; he's a faux bonhomme," a Swabian and an unrecognised genius 
who feels he has been downgraded because, though he was at one time 
solely responsible for managing the Sozialdemokrat and for party affairs 
abroad, others had to be appointed alongside  himself,  things having 
expanded. Not only is he absolutely reliable in money matters, however, 
but, more important still, he is generally recognised to be so by the 
whole of the party, and no one would venture to doubt him. In the post 
of party treasurer abroad, therefore, he is a most valuable man, and the 
others can only be glad to have been relieved of that responsibility for so 
long. Well, should anyone he dislikes happen to join the business, the 
results will be perpetual squabbling and never-ending persecution. 
That's what happened, first with Derossi and then with Schlüter, both of 
whom were hounded out by him. He now brings two charges against 
Schlüter —first, that he embezzled money. There is absolutely no proof 
of this save that, in accounts that were over a year old at the time and had 
already been passed by the auditors, Motteler discovered a sum of 150 
marks in respect of which Schlüter had failed to provide either proof of 
payment or a signed receipt. No one in Germany or over here, save for 
Motteler, cares a rap about this, for the sums paid out by Motteler 
himself are said frequently to have been certified only by the entries he 
made, and the way the chaps run the business, while egregiously pedan­
tic like everything Motteler does, is far from businesslike and accurate. 
That Schlüter was careless and guilty of small oversights—which he 
a speciously benevolent 

=====第512页=====
Letters- 1890 501 
glossed over in such a way as not himself to be the loser—may well be. 
But nothing more could be alleged against him.—Again, Schlüter is much 
given to the pursuit of the Eternal Feminine, and likes variety at that, and 
it would seem to be a fact that he had flirtations with one or two of the 
book-binding girls they employed in Zurich and even seduced them. But 
since there aren't any girls in the business over here, that no longer 
applied and the only grounds for quarrelling with Schlüter was Motteler's 
ineradicable dislike of him. That's the whole story and, if Schlüter had 
only stood up to Motteler a bit more, things might have gradually settled 
down. We others didn't make anything of it because the affair of the girls 
had long been a thing of the past, because Motteler himself had refused to 
have the matter out with Schlüter in the presence of the party's auditors, 
and because the same thing could not have recurred over here. 
So if Jonas should start spreading gossip, you will be in possession of 
the true facts. 
Jonas did indeed come to see me, somewhat embarrassed, but found 
Tussy and Edward Aveling here (it was just after the Hyde Park meet­
ing) 647 who gave him a very cool reception (on applying to the Central 
Committee643  for a journalist's pass for the meeting, Jonas had already 
been told by Aveling that he hoped the Volkszeitung would be more 
truthful in its report than heretofore) 3. So he very soon went away again 
when the Bernsteins had to leave on account of their children. The more 
elegantly the man tries to dress, the commoner he looks. 
One more thing. For the new edition of the Origin etc.a I have got to 
have Morgan's last work,b but cannot go to the British Museum early 
enough in the morning to compete for a seat in the Reading Room with 
the novel-readers. I am therefore sending you the enclosed letter for the 
department concerned, and two copies of the book. The question now 
is how these things—the letter and 1 copy—should be conveyed, 
whether direct to the department or through an intermediary who 
would vouch for me? Aveling believes that Ely in Baltimore would be 
glad to oblige. You are better acquainted with the chap, and I shall 
therefore leave it to you to decide what the best procedure would be. In 
case you should decide on an intermediary, I have included a second 
copy for him. I also include a note for Ely in case you think fit to use 
him as an intermediary.

502 Letters- 1890 
I am very glad that the Volkszeitung and the Workman's Advocate put 
in the piece about the preliminaries to the Hyde Park meeting; through 
doing so they have made possible a rapprochement between the Avelings 
and the Americans. Even Mr Jonas cannot fail to have realised while here 
what a blunder he had made when he contented himself with simply 
parroting the Executive's accusations against Aveling. 
The meeting, by the by, did not mark the end of the matter over here. 
You will have seen from the last People's Press that the Central 
Committee is remaining in existence and is founding a Legal Eight 
Hours and International Labour League.657 The constitution has been 
drafted and will be submitted on 22 June to a delegates' meeting to 
which all London labour organisations, radical clubs, etc., have been 
invited. The constitution demands 1. the implementation of the resolu­
tions of the Paris Congress473 in so far as these are not yet law in 
England, 2. such further measures for bringing about the full emancipa­
tion of the workers as may be decided upon by the Association, 3. the 
founding of an independent labour party with its own candidates for all 
constituencies in which they would stand some chance of getting in. You 
may publish this. 
In the Vienna Arbeiter-Zeitung (by the next post) there is a longish 
article of mine a about the happenings over here. 
Cordial regards to your wife,b

ENGELS TO PAUL ERNST 658 
IN BERLIN 
[Draft] 
London, 5 June 1890 
Dear Sir, 
Unfortunately I cannot do as you ask and write a letter to you for use 
against Mr Bahr. 659 This would involve me in a public polemic with the 
same, and for that I should literally have to rob myself of my own time. 
What I am writing to say, therefore, is solely for your private informa­
tion. 
Moreover, what you describe as the northern women's movement is 
totally unknown to me; all I know is a few of Ibsen's plays, nor could I 
possibly say whether, or how far, Ibsen can be held responsible for the 
more or less hysterical lucubrations of middle class and lower middle 
class female careerists. 
Again, the field which we have accustomed ourselves to describe as 
the woman question is so extensive that nothing of an exhaustive or even 
moderately satisfactory kind can be said about it within the confines of 
a letter. But of one thing you may be sure—Marx could never have 'made 
such a fuss' as Bahr asserts he did. He was not as crazy as that. 
As regards your attempt to handle the matter in a materialist way, I 
should say first of all that the materialist method turns into its opposite 
if, in an historical study, it is used not as a guide but rather as a ready-
made pattern in accordance with which one tailors the historical facts. 
And if Mr Bahr believes he has caught you out in this respect, it seems 
to me that he may not be altogether unjustified. 
You subsume the whole of Norway and everything that happens 
there under one category, philistinism, and then unhesitatingly and erro­
neously apply to that Norwegian philistinism your opinion of German 
philistinism. But here there are two facts which present an insuperable 
obstacle. 
Firstly: When, throughout Europe, the victory over Napoleon turned 
out to be the victory of reaction over the Revolution, the fear inspired 
by the latter sufficing only in its cradle, France, to wrest a bourgeois-
liberal constitution660 from the returning legitimists, Norway took occa-

=====第515页=====
504 Letters -1890 
sion to give itself a constitution661 that was far more democratic than any 
of its coevals in Europe. 
And, secondly, Norway has, during the past 20 years, experienced a 
literary revival unparallelled in any other country during that period 
save Russia. Philistine or not, this people has been far more creative than 
all the rest and is, indeed, putting its stamp on other literature, not least 
the German. 
These facts, in my view, render it necessary to examine Norwegian 
philistinism in the light of its particular characteristics. 
And in so doing you will probably find that a very important distinc­
tion emerges. In Germany philistinism was born of a failed revolution, a 
development that was interrupted and repressed. Its idiosyncratic, 
abnormally pronounced character made up of cowardice, bigotry, inep­
titude, and a total lack of initiative, resulted from the Thirty Years War221 
and the period that ensued—the very time in which practically all the 
other great nations were experiencing a rapid rise. That character 
persisted, even after Germany had again been gripped by the historical 
movement, and was strong enough to imprint  itself,  more or less as a 
generalised German type, on all the other social classes in Germany until 
such time as our working class broke out of these narrow confines. If the 
German workers are flagrantly 'unpatriotic',662 it is precisely because 
they have completely shaken off German philistine bigotry. 
Hence German philistinism is not a normal historical phase but a cari­
cature taken to extremes, a form of degeneration, just as your Polish Jew 
is a caricature of the Jews. The English, French, etc., lower middle class 
is not at all on the same level as your German lower middle class. 
In Norway, on the other hand, the class of small peasants and the 
lower middle class with a slight admixture of middle class elements—as 
it existed, say, in England and France in the 17th century—have, for 
several centuries, constituted the normal state of society. Here there is no 
question of an archaic state of affairs having been forcibly imposed upon 
them by the failure of a great movement or by a Thirty Years War. The 
country has been retarded by its isolation and by its natural circum­
stances, but its state was commensurate with the conditions of its 
production, and hence normal. It is only quite recently that large-scale 
industry has, sporadically and on a very small scale, begun to come into 
the country, where, however, there is no place for the most powerful 
lever for the concentration of capital—the stock exchange; and even the 
tremendous expansion of maritime trade has proved to be a conservative 
factor. For whereas everywhere else steam is superseding sail, Norway is

enormously increasing the number of its sailing vessels and possesses, if 
not the largest, then certainly the second largest, fleet of windjammers in 
the world, most of them owned by small and medium-sized shipping 
firms,  as in England in, say, 1720. But nevertheless this has brought some 
animation into the old, sluggish existence—animation which finds 
expression in, among other things, the literary revival. 
The Norwegian peasant was never a  serf,  so that the whole process 
takes place against an entirely different background as in Castile. The 
lower middle class Norwegian is the son of a free peasant and, such 
being the case, is a man compared with the degenerate German philis-
tine. And in the same way the Norwegian lower middle class woman is 
infinitely superior to the German lower middle class wife. And whatever 
the failings of, for example, Ibsen's plays, these reflect a world which is, 
it is true, lower middle and middle class, but utterly different from the 
German world—a world in which people still have character and initia­
tive and act independently if, by the standards of other countries, often 
eccentrically. Personally, I would prefer to get to know all I could about 
things of this sort before passing judgment. 
But in return to the above-mentioned sheep, namely Mr Bahr, I can 
only marvel at the fact that people in Germany take each other so terri­
bly seriously. Wit and humour seem to be more than ever taboo there, 
and boredom to be a civic duty. Otherwise you would surely have taken 
a closer look at Mr Bahr's 'woman' from whom all that is 'historically 
evolved' has been removed. Her skin is historically evolved, for it must 
perforce be either white or black, yellow, brown or red—hence she 
cannot have a human skin. Her hair, whether crinkled or woolly, 
whether straight or curly, whether black, red or blond, is historically 
evolved. Hence human hair is forbidden her. What, then, remains after 
you have removed what is historically evolved along with skin and hair, 
and 'the woman as such appears'? What is revealed? Simply a female ape, 
anthropopitheca, and may Mr Bahr take her to bed with him, 'purely 
tangible and perceptible', together with her 'natural instincts'.

ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON (NICOLAI-ON) 592 
IN ST. PETERSBURG 
London,  10 June 1890 
My dear sir, 
I am in possession of your kind letters of 18th December, 22 January, 
24th February and 17th May, as also of Mr. Lafargue's article returned 
which was sent back to him. I wrote to hima that you had written to him 
twice in March and April but have not had any positive reply as to 
whether he received these two letters. His wife who is here at present, 
cannot from memory tell positively. She regrets very much the change of 
ownership in the Northern Review and desires me to convey to you her 
and her husband's thanks for your kind efforts in their interest. 
Of the 4th edition Capital I am now reading proof-sheets 39-42, there 
will be less than 50 in all, as the print, though larger, is closer. As soon as 
out, it will be forwarded to you. 
I have had the letters of our authorb you kindly lent me, copied by type­
writer (the author's youngest daughter0 did them) and shall now return 
them to you in a registered letter, unless you instruct me to the contrary. 
I thank you very much for your continued and interesting information 
respecting the economic condition of your great country. Under the 
smooth surface of political quietude there is as great and as important an 
economical change going on as in any other European country, to watch 
which is of the highest interest. The consequences of this economic 
change must sooner or later develop themselves in other directions too. 
We had heard here of the death of N.G.C.d, and with much sorrow 
and sympathy. But perhaps it is better so. 
Many thanks for your congratulations of 24th February—they have 
rejoiced more than one.663 
I have been so exceedingly busy, and my eyes, though improving, are 
still so much affected by reading Russian printing, that I have not as 
yet been able to read the article in the Statistical Yearbook but

shall do so as soon as I find a free moment.664 The misuse of economic 
terms,  you point out, is a very usual defect of all literatures. Here in 
England, Rent is applied as well to the payment of the English capitalist 
farmer to his landlord, as to that of the Irish pauper farmer, who pays a 
complete tribute composed chiefly of a deduction from his fund of main­
tenance, earned by his own labour, and only in the smallest consisting of 
true rent. So the English in India transformed the land-tax paid by the 
ryot (peasant) to the State into 'rent', and consequently have, in Bengal at 
least, actually transformed the zamindar (tax-gatherer of the former 
Indian prince) into a landlord holding a nominal feudal tenure from the 
Crown exactly as in England, where the Crown is nominal proprietor of 
all the land, and the great nobles, the real owners, are by juridical fiction 
supposed to be feudal tenants of the Crown. Similarly when in the begin­
ning of the 17th century the North of Ireland was subjected to direct 
English dominion, and the English lawyer Sir John Davies found there a 
rural community with common possession of the land, which was peri­
odically divided amongst the members of the clan who paid a tribute to 
the chief,  Davies declared that tribute at once to be 'rent'.a Thus the 
Scotch lairds—chiefs of clans—profited, since the insurrection of 1745, of 
this juridical confusion, of the tribute paid to them by the clansmen, with 
a 'rent' for the lands held by them, in order to transform the whole of the 
clan-land, the common property of the clan, into their, the lairds', private 
property; for—said the lawyers, if they were not the landlords, how 
could they receive rent for that land? And thus this confusion of tribute 
and rent was the basis of the confiscation of all the lands of the Scottish 
Highlands for the benefit of a few chiefs of clan who very soon after 
drove out the old clansmen and replaced them by sheep as described in 
Capital, chapter 24, 2 (p. 754, 3rd edition).b 
With kind regards 
Yours very faithfully

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 
IN BERLIN 
London, 19 June 1890 
Dear Liebknecht, 
Hardly a minute goes by without a changement de décoration* 
Schorlemmer has asked me to join him on a cruise in July—a variety of 
plans have been submitted for my kind consideration. My doctor tells 
me I must get away as soon as possible and devote this summer to the 
betterment of my health so as to be up to the mark again when winter 
comes. I myself have noticed that my bad nights have also been 
conducive to bad work and that I shall have to break off as soon as possi­
ble. So I can't very well reject the plan out of hand. 
On the other hand Laura is pressing Lenchen to accompany her on a 
fortnight's trip to Paris, which would be perfectly feasible during my 
absence and would do the old lady a power of good. 
A further consideration is that your Reichstag is still in session and 
there's no knowing a fortnight in advance when or whether it will 
adjourn. 
So it could be that in about 10 days' time I shall take myself off for 3 
weeks. I shall in any case be back here by 25-26 July and Lenchen prob­
ably a few days before that. So if you could arrange your trip in such a 
way as to arrive after, say, 21 or 22 July, you would find everything 
ready for you, and a few days later I myself should also be back. 
All this is, of course, provisional for the moment, and I shan't be able 
to tell you anything more definite for a day or two, but I thought it as 
well to inform you immediately of this circumstance; that I shall go is 
pretty certain, but there's still some doubt about the details. All that is 
certain is that I shall be back in London before the end of July and 
Lenchen before me. None of these plans would keep me away later than 
the 26th. 
So Heligoland is to become German.667 I really look forward to the 
outcry of the good Heligolanders, who will fight tooth and nail to 
prevent their incorporation into the vast barracks of the fatherland. And 
a change of plan

they have every reason to do so; no sooner has it been annexed than their 
island will be converted into a large fortress commanding the anchorage 
to the north-east, and they, poor devils, will be subject to eviction, as 
though they were so many Irish tenant farmers or, perhaps, Scottish 
sheep who must make room for deer. 
O nay, O nay, enlarge his fatherland they say,a  yet not one German 
from without, therein would make his way. A sea-girt Alsace à la 
Schleswig-Holstein! That was the only prop still lacking in the German 
imperial force.

ENGELS TO NATALIE LIEBKNECHT 
IN BERLIN 
London,  19 June 1890 
Dear Mrs Liebknecht, 
If I made a reference to your remarks about your being isolated and 
virtually ostracised in Leipzig, this was perfectly natural. From what 
you said I was bound to conclude that you found Leipzig insufferable 
and am glad to learn that such was by no means the case. 
As to any other comparison between the merits of Leipzig and the 
drawbacks of Berlin, this is something I am really unable to discuss, as I 
don't know the former at all, while the latter are no more than a distant 
memory and since those days Berlin is said to have improved quite mirac­
ulously, or so the Berliners maintain. However I'm perfectly willing 
a E. M. Arndt, Des  Deutschen Vaterland 

=====第522页=====
Letters - 1890 511 
to believe you when you say that, from the point of view of family life, 
Leipzig has immeasurably more to offer than the metropolis of the 
Brandenburgian Sahara.668 
All these, I have written to tell Singer and Liebknecht, are matters 
which everybody must thrash out with  himself,  his family and the party 
and in which we outsiders must acquiesce. However I can only say that 
I am also firmly of the opinion that Liebknecht's place is in Berlin if the 
party leadership and the party organ are transferred there. Whether or 
not that happens is not for me to say; I can only express an unauthorita­
tive opinion. But should it happen and Liebknecht remain in Leipzig, he 
would, by so doing, lower himself to the status of a second-class party 
leader, pension himself off, so to speak, and find himself in a situation in 
which he could be neither consulted nor heard when an important prob­
lem arose—in short, it would be the first step towards resignation and 
you wouldn't want that. 
People like us are tossed around by politics in a quite singular way. 
When in 1858 Lassalle wanted to bring out a paper with Marx and myself 
in Berlin, we couldn't actually say no and were prepared to move to the 
sandy metropolis—fortunately negotiations broke down. 669 And for me 
that would have meant terminating my contracts with the firma  and for us 
both a removal with much more far-reaching consequences than those of 
a transition from Leipzig to Berlin. If, therefore, circumstances arise 
which make your removal to the imperial sand-box unavoidable, you can 
certainly draw comfort, not only from the belated discovery that life there 
is bearable after all, but also from the certain knowledge that Liebknecht 
is thereby assuming the position in the party that is his by right and that 
he has come to the place where he can do full justice to his position. 
At all events this business will be decided before very long and it is 
my hope that, whatever that decision may be, you will in the long run 
become reconciled to it. 
Kindest regards from Nim, Mme Lafargue, the Roshers and 
Yours very sincerely,

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
[Odde],  Friday, 4 July 1890 
My dear Laura, 
I hope you got as safe to Paris as we did to Norway. We had a very 
quiet passage, though lots of people sick, sighted the coast of Norway 
yesterday afternoon, and by 6 were between the islands and rocks. Went 
up the Harvanger Fiord which leads right into the heart of the country, 
and are now at the farthest point, Odde, where we remain until to­
morrow. Had a drive up the valley this morning and only just back; it 
rained a little, but not enough to spoil the scenery which is grand. The 
sun set yesterday at 10 and there was no real night, only a rather deep 
dusk, and red sky in the north. The people are very primitive, but a 
sound strong handsome race; they understand my Danish but I cannot 
make much of their Norwegian. Here at this place the invaders coming 
by this one ship have cleared the place of Norwegian money in change 
for English, and the post-office of postage stamps.

We sail from here to-morrow and shall on Monday be at Trondheim, 
a good way farther up north. If the scenery does not get worse than what 
we saw to-day, I shall be quite satisfied. It is in some respects like 
Switzerland, in others very different. So far the beer is not what one 
might expect, but I shall reserve judgment until I have seen the towns. 
This Odde is about twenty houses, including church, hotel, post-office 
and skolehus.a Everything built of timber, although they have about

Saturday the 26th inst. And look forward to seeing you as soon as may 
be. Come straight away if that suits you, since we shall probably be

516 Letters -1890 
The first news to reach us from the outside world is today pinned up 
in our vessel and reads: The German Social Democracy will reorganize 
on October 1st and is preparing a plan of organization to be discussed and 
adopted at a congress in October.67* Otherwise nothing of any impor­
tance—but it's enjoyable to be promptly presented with that news. 
As young William3 was favouring Norway with his presence at the 
same time,675 I kept as quiet as possible about my itinerary, lest there 
should be any police chicanery. On our way home we met the fleet in 
Molde; 'young Hopeful', however, was not present, having gone off 
gallivanting in a torpedo boat; he sneaked past us in the Geiranger Fjord, 
much to the annoyance of the middle-class English gang on board our 
ship,  who would have liked to give three cheers for a real live emperor. 
While the sailors in the fleet were splendid chaps, the junior officers 
and midshipmen differed little from the ensigns of the Prussian guards, 
their every turn of phrase being of the kind we've known from time 
immemorial; the senior officers we met in the hotel dressed in mufti 
were quite different and were in no way distinguishable from ordinary 
civilians. The predominant accents were those of old Prussia. We nearly 
died of laughter at the sight of two fat admirals sitting squashed together 
in a minute Norwegian cab (there was barely room in it for one) as they 
went to pay their calls (Primrose Hill would accommodate the whole of 
Molde twice over); all one could see from behind were apaulettes and 
tricorns. 
It was a very pleasant and very interesting trip and I liked the 
Norwegians a great deal. Up in Tromsö we visited the Lapps and their 
reindeer and in Hammerfest saw piles of dried cod—at first I took it to 
be firewood—and, at North Cape, the famous midnight sun. But there's 
nothing one gets sick of more quickly than perpetual daylight when for 
a solid week there's literally no night at all and it's always quite light 
when one goes to bed. 
We sampled the beer conscientiously right up to 71 degrees of lati­
tude;  it was good but not so good as the German  stuff,  and invariably 
bottled. Only in Trondheim could one actually get draught beer. Here 
too, by the way, the legislators are much concerned with temperance and 
it would seem that sales of Bismarck's spirits have been steadily drop­

The train from Gossevangen to Bergen covers 108 kilometres in 4 1/2 
hours—24 kilometres per hour! But it passes through rock of all kinds 
out of which pretty well the whole line had to be blasted. 
Up north on the Svartisen, which is one enormous ice field, we 
walked on a glacier separated from the sea only by the low moraine, i.e. 
it drops to approximately 100 feet above sea level. 
But now it's time for breakfast and I shall close so as to be able to 
hand this letter in for posting immediately it is over. 
Warm regards to your wife and children and to yourself from

The People's Press is also likely to go under in a fortnight's time. It 
was an attempt by the Fabians176 to insinuate themselves into the lead­
ership of the movement—at the same time there was much good will 
but to an even greater extent a lack of journalistic and business experi­
ence on the part of the 2 men actually running it,a with the result that 
the whole thing has got into a muddle. There'll be an unpleasant hiatus 
but it will, I trust, lead to the founding of an organ representative of the 
new unions. 
Those two battles in Leeds were magnificent.677 It was splendid news 
to be greeted with on our return. 
There is also a social democratic organisation in Bergen, but we had 
neither the time nor the occasion to look it up; I merely saw in the news­
papers that it had its own premises and had applied for a licence to sell 
beer.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE 40 
AT LE PERREU X 
London, 30 July 1890 
My dear Laura, 
Here we are again from the icy regions of the North—temperature 
mostly 10° in cloudy weather, very hot when the sun shone, two flannels 
and a topcoat not too much on an average! The journey has done us both 
a world of good, and with a Nachkur* at the seaside I hope to be 
completely set up again. I found Nim quite enthusiastic about her stay 
in Paris, she never enjoyed herself so much, and if I am not mistaken and 
you do not take care, you will have her an annual customer. 
We met the German fleet at Molde but young Williamb  was not 
there—he sneaked past our steamer later on in the Sunelvsfjord in a 
torpedo boat—so that with the impossibility of getting papers we were 
out altogether of la grande politique. Fortunately nothing happened 
worth knowing—the first news at Bergen were about the reorganisation 
of the German Party after Oct. 1st, 52 and on arriving here, the splendid 
news about the two fights in Leeds677 where young Will Thorne proved 
himself a leader in battle of both courage and ability. This mode of 
lawful resistance is very much to be approved of, especially here in 
England—and it succeeded. 
Enclosed I found on my return and opened, but it is for Même. 
Cannot anyone in Paris give us any information about that de 
Lavigerie who here gives as references Baudin, Ferroul, Guesde, the 
whole of the party in the Chamber and those in the Conseil Municipal} 
Of course, if none of all these gentlemen will either disavow or acknow­
ledge this man, or give any information about him, what must the people 
here do? So long as none of his references repudiate him, the people here 
cannot but take him for genuine. And if afterwards he turns out a black 
sheep, or does harm to our French friends (for to the people here he can 
do none), they must blame themselves. 
Now I must conclude. You will not want telling that I found an 
immense heap of correspondence, papers, etc. here and that I have my 
" after-cure - b William II

PAUL LAFARGUE TO NIKOLAION (DANIELSON) 
IN ST. PETERSBURG 
Le Perreux, 14 December 1889 
Dear Sir, 
Thank you for your letter and for the news it contains about my arti­
cles: I have still not received anything from the directress of the Review.3-
Engels' eyes are still ailing: however I think that, thanks to the 
precautions he is taking, they are better rather than worse. Engels does 
not like to talk about  himself;  it is only from third parties that I learn 
about his state of health which, fortunately, is satisfactory. 
He is working at the moment on the 3rd volume;b Kautsky is helping 
him.678 You are familiar with Williams'0  cramped handwriting; on the 
manuscripts it is even worse; since they contain abbreviations which 
have to be guessed at, crossings-out and innumerable corrections which 
have to be deciphered; it is as difficult to read as a Greek palimpsest with 
ligatures. Kautsky reads the manuscript through and makes a copy 
which Engels then verifies with the other manuscripts. In one of his 
recent letters, Engels wrote that he was satisfied with this way of work­
ing, and that Kautsky was very good at making out Williams' writing. 
Engels has just passed his sixty-ninth birthday and, as he wrote to me, 
even if one turns the figures upside down, they still read 69; I replied that 
he had only to wait until he was 99 to become 66 by inversion. It is extra­
ordinary that he is able to work on the publication of Williams' works, 
and keep up his vast correspondence with almost all the countries of 
Europe and America. I do not know if he writes to you in Russian, which 
he reads fluently, but he insists on corresponding in the language of the 
1 A. M. Yevreinova - b of  Capital  -c Marx's pen-name

522 Appendix 
person he is writing to. He is a veritable polyglot and knows not only 
literary languages, but even dialects such as Icelandic, and ancient 
languages such as Provençal and Catalan. His knowledge of these 
languages is not superficial; in Spain and Portugal I read letters to friends 
there who found that they were written in perfect Spanish and Portuguese, 
and I know that he writes in Italian. There is nothing more difficult than 
to write in these three sister-languages full of similarities, and not become 
confused. Engels, however, is a marvellous man, I have never come across 
such a mind, so young and alert and an erudition so encyclopedic. When 
one thinks that for more than 20 years he worked as a legal consultant 
with a Manchester trading establishment, one wonders when he found the 
time to amass all the knowledge contained inside a head which, be it said, 
is not very large, in spite of the fact that he is very tall. 
I shall pass on to Kautsky what you say about him, and he will be 
happy, as I am, to learn that his work is appreciated in Russia as it is in 
Germany and France. 
My articles will contain tables to illustrate, it is impossible to engage 
in comparative and philosophical statistics without illustration. I am 
sending you one of the tables. If the Review so wishes, I can send the 
cliches for the tables; but I would prefer it if they had them remade, since 
I shall extend my research up to 1888, and not 1886. I shall have the 
engravings made, it will not be very expensive; because they will be 
reproduced using the photo-engraving method, as was the one which I 
am sending you. 
My best regards

Notes 
1. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard. The address, written by him on the 
back, reads: F. A. Sorge Esq., Hoboken N.J., U.S. America. 
2. Marx first thought of the need for an English translation of Das Kapital 
while working on the manuscript in 1865 (see his letter to Engels of 31 July 
1865;  present edition, Vol. 42, pl72). The English journalist Peter Fox, a 
member of the General Council of the International, was to look for a 
publisher. However he died, in 1869, and the matter remained unsettled. 
The English version of Volume I, edited by Engels, was published by Swan 
Sonnenschein, Lowrey & Co. in January 1887, after Marx's death. The 
translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling, between mid-
1883 and March 1886. Eleanor Marx-Aveling helped prepare the edition. 
The translation was based on the third German edition of Das Kapital, due 
account being taken of the French edition and Marx's directions for the 
English translation, which failed to materialise, planned for late 1877. 
3. Between September and December 1886 Wilhelm Liebknecht, Eleanor 
Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling toured the United States at the invita­
tion of Executive of the Socialist Labor Party of North America. They gave 
talks and lectures in a number of cities on the theory and history of social­
ism, on the working-class movement in Europe and on other themes. After 
the tour the Executive, which had financed it, accused Aveling of over-
expenditure. This charge was taken up by the bourgeois press and used for 
anti-socialist agitation. The conflict between Aveling and the Executive 
lasted for several months. Engels took part in settling it. The Socialist Labor 
Party of the United States (originally called the Workingmen's Party) was 
set up at the Philadelphia union congress, 19-22 June 1876, through the 
merger of the US sections of the First International, led by F. A. Sorge and 
Otto Weydemeyer, with the Lassallean-type Labor Party of Illinois and the 
Social Democratic Party, led by A. Strasser, A. Gabriel and Peter J. 
McGuire. It was the first Marxist party in America. However, it failed to 
win a mass following because of the sectarian policy of its leaders, who 
wanted no links with the mass organisations of the indigenous US workers, 
and because of the Lassalleans' prevalence in a number of local branches. 
4. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: K. Marx and F. 
Engels, On the United States, Moscow, Progress Publishers, 1979. 
5. In June 1886, a Hague court sentenced F. D. Nieuwenhuis to one year in

524 Notes 
prison and a fine of 50 guldens on charges of 'lese majesté' and 'denigration 
of officials' in the press. Early in January 1887 the conviction was upheld by 
the Netherlands Supreme Court. The charges were based on two articles by 
Nieuwenhuis published anonymously in the newspaper Recht voor Allen. 
He was released from prison on 1 September 1887. 
6. In the Mayoral election in New York on 2 November 1886 Henry George, 
the candidate of the United Labor Party, got 68,110 votes, 31 per cent of the 
total cast. During the preparation for the municipal election in New York 
in August 1886, the United Labor Party was founded to rally the workers 
for joint political action. The initiative came from the New York Central 
Workers' Union, an association of New York trade unions formed in 1882. 
Similar parties were set up in many other cities. 
7. In November 1886 elections were held to the US Congress and the State 
legislatures. Led by its parties, the working class achieved substantial 
success in the elections in New York (see note 6), Chicago and Milwaukee. 
In Chicago, ten Labor Party candidates were elected to the State Legislative 
Assembly (one to the Senate and nine to the Lower Chamber). The party's 
candidate to the US Congress was short of only 64 votes. In Milwaukee, the 
Labor Party candidate was elected Mayor, one of its men got into the State 
Senate, six into the Lower Chamber, and one into the US Congress. 
8. In his letter of 9 January 1887 Martignetti informed Engels that he was 
being persecuted for his socialist views and was, as an official of the govern­
ment notary archives, in danger of dismissal. He asked Engels to help him 
find employment outside Italy. 
9. From November 1850 Engels supervised the Manchester branch of the 
Ermen and Engels German textile firm. The German side of the enterprise 
was run by Fr. Engels Sr., with the assistance of Anthony Ermen. The firm's 
office was in Barmen. In 1860, after his father's death, Engels received 
£10,000 from his brothers in compensation for his share in the family 
concern in Engelskirchen, which consolidated his financial and legal stand­
ing in the Manchester firm. From June 1864 to June 1869 Engels was a co-
owner of the Ermen and Engels firm. After five years in this capacity he 
withdrew from the firm and devoted himself entirely to party work, schol­
arship and journalism.

Americans. 1848-1895. A Selection, International Publishers, New York, 
1953. 
11. In a letter dated 10 December 1886 Kelley-Wischnewetzky asked Engels to 
write a preface to the American edition of The Condition of the Working 
Class in England in 1844, which she had translated into English. She argued 

=====第536页=====
Notes 525 
that Engels' Afterword, written for this edition in February 1886, was out 
of date (see present edition, Vol. 26), and suggested that the new preface 
should, above all, contain a critique of Henry George and that the words 'in 
1844'  should be omitted from the title. In reply to her request Engels wrote 
the article 'The Labor Movement in America', which was to open the 
book. 
12. Engels' article 'The Labor Movement in America' opened the American 
edition of his The Condition of the Working Class in England, published in 
New York in 1887. That same year the article appeared, in Engels' German 
translation, under the heading 'Die Arbeiterbewegung in Amerika', in the 
Sozialdemokrat (10 and 17 June). In July separate prints, in German and 
English, were distributed in New York. The article was also published as a 
pamphlet in London (see present edition, Vol. 26) and, in French, in Le 
Socialiste (9, 16 and 23 July). Even before the publication of the book the 
article was, without Engels' knowledge, translated into German by 
Alexander Jonas, editor of the New Yorker Volkszeitung, and published in 
this paper in April 1887. Engels, displeased with the quality of the transla­
tion, lodged an official protest. 
13. This letter was first published in English, abridged, in: Frederick Engels, 
Paul and Laura Lafargue, Correspondence. 1887-1890,Vo\. 2, Foreign 
Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1960. 
14. Russo-German rapprochement appeared to be on the cards in early 1887. In 
the course of negotiations between the two countries, the Russian ambas­
sador, P. Shuvalov, proposed to Bismarck that the 'alliance of three emper­
ors', which was expiring in the summer of 1887, should be resumed, but 
without Austrian participation. Shuvalov's proposal also envisaged Russia's 
neutrality in the event of another Franco-German war and a free hand for 
Russia in the Balkans. Addressing the Reichstag on 11 January 1887, 
Bismarck urged the need for friendly relations with Russia. An anti-French 
press campaign, the mobilisation of reservists and other steps on the part of 
the German government gave rise to fears of an imminent military clash 
with France (the 'war alarm' in January 1887). However, the Russian 
government refused to back up Shuvalov's proposals and Bismarck's 
actions. 
15. On 14 January 1887, Bismarck dissolved the Reichstag in view of its refusal 
to endorse the proposed seven-year military budget (the bill on the septen-
nate).  The elections to the new Reichstag, held on 21 February, were 
attended by a brutal campaign of terror, directed above all against the 
Socialist Party. Nevertheless, the Social Democrats polled 763,128 votes 
(10.1 per cent of the total), 213,038 more than in the 1884 elections. 
However, owing to the undemocratic additional ballots law the number of 
Social Democratic deputies declined to 11, as against 24 in the previous 
Reichstag. 

=====第537页=====
526 Notes 
16. In January 1887 the Daily News reported that the Bismarck government 
intended to demand that the French government explain the concentration 
of French troops on the German border. On 25 January the semi-official 
Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung emphatically denied this report. 
17. An excerpt from this letter was first published, in the language of the orig­
inal (English), in K. Marx and F. Engels, On Literature and Art, Progress 
Publishers, Moscow, 1976. 
18. On 1 February 1887 Laura Lafargue informed Engels of the conflict that 
had arisen between Caroline-Rémy Séverine-Guebhard, publisher of the 
newspaper Le Cri du Peuple, on the one hand, and the associate editors of 
this paper - Jules Guesde, Gabriel Deville, Albert Goullé - on the other. 
The latter emphatically objected to Séverine's public pronouncements in 
defence of the anarchist Duval, convicted on charges of burglary, and to the 
publication in the paper, as a leader, of an anti-German article by one 
Bienvenu. They also demanded the dismissal of the journalist Georges de 
Labruyère, notorious for his Boulangist views (see note 137). As a result of 
the conflict, almost all leading members of the editorial board withdrew 
from the Cri du Peuple. They started a new paper, the Voie du peuple, the 
first issue of which appeared on 2 February 1887. The paper lasted only a 
few weeks, the last issue appearing on 17 March. 
19. The Possibilists (Broussists) were a reformist trend in the French socialist 
movement between the 1880s and the early 20th century. Its leaders - Paul 
Brousse and Benoit Malon -caused a split in the French Workers' Party (see 
note 33) in 1882 and formed the Federation of Socialist Workers. Its ideo­
logical basis was the theory of municipal socialism. The Possibilists pursued 
a 'policy of the possible' ('la politique des possibilités'). At the beginning of 
the 20th century the Possibilists merged with the French Socialist Party. 
20. Presumably Engels means the newspaper Le Citoyen, of which Jules 
Guesde was a co-founder. It appeared from 1 October 1881 to 8 March 
1884.  In October 1882 it merged with the newspaper La Bataille, edited by 
Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray. As a result, the French Workers' Party (see note 
33) lost its influence on the paper. 
21. The Socialist League was founded in December 1884 by a group of English 
socialists who had withdrawn from the Social Democratic Federation (see 
note 62). The League's organisers included Eleanor Marx Aveling, Ernest 
Belfort Bax and William Morris. 'The Manifesto of the Socialist League' (see 
The Commonweal No.l, February 1885) stated that its members advocated 
'the principles of Revolutionary International Socialism' and sought 'a 
change in the basis of Society ... which would destroy the distinctions of 
classes and nationalities'. The tasks of the League included the formation of 
a national socialist party, the conquest of political power through the elec­
tion of socialists to local government bodies, and the promotion of the trade 
union and co-operative movement. In the League's early years its leaders 

=====第538页=====
Notes 527 
took an active part in the working-class movement. However, in 1887 the 
League split into three factions (Anarchist elements, 'parliamentarists and 
'anti-parliamentarists'). With sectarian tendencies growing stronger, the 
League gradually distanced itself from the day-to-day struggle of the British 
workers and finally disintegrated in 1889-90. 
22. Radical Clubs began to emerge in London and other cities in the 1870s. 
They consisted of bourgeois radicals and workers. In the Clubs of London's 
poorer areas, such as the East End, the workers predominated. The Clubs 
criticised the Irish policy of Gladstone's Liberal government and urged an 
extension of the suffrage and other democratic reforms. From the early 
1880s they engaged in socialist propaganda. In 1885 London's Radical 
Clubs united in the Metropolitan Radical Federation. 
23. Two French translations of Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte were made, almost simultaneously, by the French socialists Paul 
Lavigne and Edouard Fortin. Fortin's translation, sent to Engels somewhat 
earlier (see Engels' letter to Paul Lavigne of 1 December 1885 in Vol. 47 of 
the present edition) and edited by Engels at Fortin's request, was published 
first in Le Socialiste, the newspaper of the French Workers' Party, in 
January-November 1891 and appeared in book form in Lille the same year. 
24. This concerns the charges the levelled at Aveling by the Executive of the 
Socialist Labor Party of North America (see note 3). This letter was the first 
of the many Engels wrote to American and German working-class leaders 
in defence of Aveling. 
25. On 30 December 1886 The New York Herald published an article headlined 
'Aveling's Unpaid Labor', containing accusations against Aveling (see note 
3). Cabled to London, it was reprinted, abridged, in The Daily Telegraph (1 
January 1887) and The Evening Standard (13 January 1887). After the 
publication of the article in England, Aveling cabled a denial to America, 
which appeared in The New York Herald on 10 January 1887. An official 
denial by the Avelings addressed to the Executive of the Socialist Labor 
Party was published in the Herald on 15 January 1887. 
26. This refers to the article 'Aveling und die Sozialisten' in the New Yorker 
Volkszeitung, No. 10,12 January 1887, which was the first public statement 
of the charges levelled at Aveling (see note 3). The article was reprinted in 
the Wochenblatt (weekly supplement) of the New Yorker Volkszeitung on 
22 January. As can be seen from F.A. Surge's letter to Engels of 28 February 
1887 the article was written by Alexander Jonas, the chief editor of the 
paper. 
27. At the end of November 1886 a court in Leipzig sentenced the Social 
Democratic worker K. Schumann to four years in prison and another eleven 
people to various prison terms on charges of 'rebellion'. The pretext for the 
prosecution was the farewell party given to Schumann by Leipzig workers 
on 21 September 1886 in connection with his expulsion from the city under 

=====第539页=====

the Anti-Socialist Law (see note 52). 
28. On 11 November 1887 the US Supreme Court sentenced four leaders of the 
Chicago Labor Union - Albert K. Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fischer 
and George Engel - to be hanged. In the spring of 1886 a mass working-
class movement for the eight-hour day developed in America's leading 
industrial centres (Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, St Louis, 
Boston, Baltimore and Milwaukee). In Chicago, up to 65,000 struck in the 
early days of May. On 3 May, workers clashed with police at a rally. At 
another rally, held in Haymarket Square on the following day, an agent 
provocateur threw a bomb, killing seven policemen and four workers. The 
police opened fire. Several people were killed and over 200 injured. Many 
people were arrested, including the leaders of the Chicago Labor Union. 
Despite the broad campaign in the US and Europe in defence of the four 
convicted men, they were executed. In commemoration of the Chicago 
events of 1886, the 1889 International Socialist Congress in Paris 
proclaimed the 1st of May international workers' solidarity day. 
29. This letter was first published in English in Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, 
Letters to Americans. 1848-1895. A Selection, International Publishers, New 
York, 1953. 
30. 'Reptiles' and 'the reptile press' were designations used by left-wing writers 
for the venal reactionary pro-government press. The 'reptile fund' referred 
to Bismarck's special fund for bribing periodicals and individual journalists. 
31. In her letter of 7 February 1887 Laura Lafargue asked Engels to remind 
Eleanor of Pyotr Lavrov's copy of the Historical Review and to send her 
(Laura) the January issue. 
32. This refers to the Circular containing accusations against Aveling (see note 
3) which was directed by the Executive of the Socialist Labor Party to the 
party's branches on 7 January 1887. It was signed by Wilhelm Ludwig 
Rosenberg, Hermann Walther and others. 
33. Engels means the French Workers' Party (Parti ouvrier  français),  formed at 
the 1880 Le Havre congress, when a party programme drawn up with 
Marx's participation was adopted (see his 'Preamble to the Programme of 
the French Workers' Party', present edition, Vol. 24). The adoption of the 
programme led to an aggravation of the inner-party struggle between the 
Possibilists (see note 19) and the Guesdists (the revolutionary wing), and to 
a split at the 1882 St Etienne congress. The Guesdists retained the name of 
the Workers' Party. They relied for support on the workers of France's 
largest industrial centres, in particular those of some big plants in Paris. The 
struggle to win broad support among the workers was one of the party's top 
priorities. 
34. On 30 October 1886 Laura Lafargue informed Engels of the publication of 
the book Das Recht auf den vollen Arbeitsertrag in geschichtlicher 
Darstellung by the Austrian sociologist and lawyer Anton Menger. The 

=====第540页=====
Notes 529 
author alleged that Marx's economic theory was 'not original'. Some of 
Marx's conclusions, he maintained, were borrowings from William 
Thompson and other English Ricardian Utopian Socialists. Engels believed 
that by attacking Menger directly he would provide him a welcome oppor­
tunity for self-advertising. He therefore decided to answer him either in an 
editorial in Die Neue Zeit or in a review signed by the journal's editor, Karl 
Kautsky. Poor health prevented Engels from writing the bulk of the text as 
intended. The article was completed, with his help, by Kautsky. It appeared 
unsigned, under the title 'Juristen-Sozialismus' , in Die Neue Zeit, Vol. 2, 
1887 (see present edition, Vol. 2). 
35. Engels means diplomatic preparations for the 1866 Austro-Prussian war. 
Early in March of that year he had secured, through Robert Goltz, the 
Russian Ambassador to Paris, an undertaking by Napoleon III that France 
would maintain positive neutrality towards Russia in the event of an 
Austro-Prussian war. At about the same time, Bismarck conducted talks 
with the Italian general Giuseppe Govone in Berlin on forming a Prusso-
Italian coalition against Austria. On 8 April 1866 Prussia and Italy signed a 
treaty establishing a defensive and offensive alliance. It provided for the 
transfer of Veneto to Italy in the event of victory over Austria. 
36. On 14 January 1887 the German Reichstag, by 186 votes to 154, adopted a 
bill limiting the army contingent to 441,000 persons, with a three-year term 
of service (the government had insisted on 468,000 for seven years). As a 
result, the Reichstag was disbanded and new elections held (see note 15). On 
11 March 1887 the new Reichstag passed the bill on the septennate despite 
opposition from the Social Democratic group. 
37. This refers to the festival of international brotherhood which was to be held 
in Paris on 19 February 1887 on the initiative of a number of socialist émigré 
organisations. German, Scandinavian, Polish and Russian socialists took 
part. The festival was to protest against the arms drive and war preparations 
in Europe. At the request of one of the organisers, the Russian socialist 
émigré Ossip Zetkin, Engels addressed a message to the Organising 
committee of the festival (see present edition, Vol. 26). It was read out at the 
festive meeting and published in Le Socialiste on 26 February and, in 
German translation, in the Sozialdemocrat on 11 March and the New York 
Sozialist on 19 March. 
38. Danielson's letter to Engels was dated 22 January (3 February new style) 
1887. 
39. This is the pseudonym Engels used in his correspondence with Nikolai 
Danielson. Percy White Rosher was the name of the husband of the niece of 
Engels's wife. 
40. This letter was first published, in the language of the original (English), in 
F. Engels, P. et L. Lafargue, Correspondance, t. 2 (1887-1890), Paris, Ed. 
sociales, 1956.

41. On 24 February 1887 the Voie du peuple, under the general headline 'La 
Revolution en Allemagne. Prise de Berlin', carried an editorial entitled 
'Victoire!' devoted to the German Reichstag election of 21 February (see 
note 15). 
42. Engels compares Paul Singer's success at the Reichstag election to that of the 
French Radical Edouard Lockroy, who obtained 272,680 votes, more than 
any other candidate, at the 1885 parliamentary election and was called 'le 
premier élu de la France' (France's first choice). As can be seen from Singer's 
letter of 7 March 1887, Engels congratulated him on the great success. 
43. After failing to poll the requisite number of votes at the Reichstag election 
of 21 February 1887, Wilhelm Liebknecht succeeded in winning a seat in the 
run-off in Berlin's Fourth constituency on 30 August 1888 in lieu of 
Wilhelm Hasenclever, who had dropped out for health reasons. 
44. The Centre was a political party of German Catholics formed in June 1870. 
It expressed the separatist and anti-Prussian sentiments current in West and 
Southwest Germany. (The seats of its Reichstag deputies were in the centre 
of the hall, hence the name of the party.) The Centre's following consisted 
of socially disparate sections of Catholic clergy, landowners, bourgeois and 
peasants. Its deputies usually took a noncommittal attitude, manoeuvring 
between the pro-government parties and the Left opposition groups. 
Although it opposed the Bismarck government in the mid-1870s and early 
1880s, the Centre voted for its measures against the working-class and 
socialist movement. Engels gave a detailed characterisation of the Centre in 
his work The Role of Force in History (see present edition, Vol. 26) and in 
his article 'What Now?' (see Vol. 27). 
45. The Party of Progress, founded in June 1861, advocated the unification of 
Germany under the aegis of Prussia, the convocation of an all-German 
parliament, and a liberal Ministry responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. 
Fearing a popular revolution, it did not support the basic democratic 
demands - universal suffrage and the freedom of the press, association and 
assembly. In 1866 the Party of Progress split. Its right wing founded the 
National Liberal Party, which capitulated to the Bismarck government. 
After the final unification of Germany in 1871, the Progressists continued 
to describe themselves as an opposition party, but their opposition was 
purely declaratory. In March 1884 they merged with the left wing of the 
National Liberals to form the German Free-Thinking Party (Die Deutsche 
Freisinnige Partei). 
46. Despite Bismarck's anti-French press campaign in Alsace Lorraine, which 
was supported by the clergy, candidates opposing his militarist ambitions 
were put up in the Reichstag elections. All the fifteen nominees elected were 
members of the Elsasser (Alsatian) party. 
47. This refers to Aveling's letter of 26 February 1887 which was circulated, in 
printed form, to the sections of the Socialist Labor Party of North America

and other socialist organisations. It was a detailed answer to the accusations 
levelled at Aveling by the party's Executive on  7 January 1887 (see note 32). 
48. On 8 February 1887 the Voie du peuple began serialising Guy de 
Maupassant's novel Bel Ami. 
49. A passage from this letter was first published in English in Karl Marx and 
Frederick Engels Letters to Americans. 1848-1895.A selection, New York, 
International Publishers, 1953. 
50. The second ballot, in eighteen constituencies, brought the Social Democrats 
another five seats in the Reichstag (Breslau-West, Elberfeld, Frankfurt am 
Main, Hanover and Solingen). 
51. At the end of 1884, Bismarck, seeking to activate Germany's colonial policy, 
demanded that the Reichstag should vote an annual subsidy to shipping 
companies to enable them to operate regular lines to East Asia, Australia 
and Africa. The left wing of the Social Democratic parliamentary group, led 
by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, came out against the government 
scheme. The right wing, which made up the majority (Dietz, Frohme, 
Grillenberger and others), intended to vote for the subsidy, on the pretext 
that it would help promote international communications. Under pressure 
from the majority the group decided that the issue was of a non-fundamen­
tal nature and every deputy should be free to vote as he chose (see Der 
Sozialdemokrat, No. 50, 11 December 1884). The sharp critique of the 
proposed subsidies in Der Sozialdemokrat and in resolutions of the party 
leadership forced the majority of the Social Democratic group to somewhat 
modify its stand during the discussion of the matter in the Reichstag in 
March 1855. The group made its support for the subsidies conditional on 
the adoption of a number of its own proposals. Since the Reichstag rejected 
these, all Social Democratic deputies voted against the subsidies. 
52. The Anti-Socialist law {Gesetz gegen die gemeingefährlichen Bestrebungen 
der Sozialdemokratie) was introduced by the Bismarck government, with 
the support of the majority of the Reichstag, on 21 October 1878, as a 
means of combating the socialist and working-class movement. It imposed 
a ban on all Social Democratic and working-class organisations and on the 
socialist and workers' press; socialist literature was subject to confiscation, 
and Social Democrats to reprisals. However, under the Constitution, the 
Social Democratic Party retained its group in parliament. By combining 
underground activities with the use of legal possibilities, in particular by 
working to overcome reformist and anarchist tendencies in its own ranks, 
the party was able to consolidate and expand its influence among the 
masses. Marx and Engels gave the party leaders considerable help. Under 
the pressure of the mass working-class movement the Anti-Socialist Law 
was repealed (1 October 1890). For Engels' characterisation of the law see 
his article 'Bismarck and the German Workers Party' (present edition, Vol. 
24, pp407-09).

54. In his letter of 20 February 1887 Sorge suggested to Engels that Florence 
Kelley-Wischnewetzky should be asked to translate the Manifesto of the 
Communist Party into English for publication in the USA. This project did 
not materialise. An English edition of the Manifesto, in Sam Moore's 
translation and edited by Engels, appeared in London in 1888. 
55. On 20 February 1887 Sorge informed Engels that the English edition of 
Volume I of Capital was not selling well in the USA, and suggested sending 
copies of the book to the editors of leading American journals for review­
ing. 
56. Part of the English edition of Volume I of Capital was bought by the 
American firm Scribner & Welford, which gave the book a new title page, 
reading Capital. A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production; from the 
German by S. Moore and E. Aveling, and edited by Frederick Engels, N.Y., 
Scribner & Welford, 1887, 2 v. 
57. An unsigned review of the English edition of Volume I of Capital appeared 
in the London literary and critical journal Athenaeum, No. 3097, 5 March 
1887. 
58. The third, cheap English edition (10s 6d) of Volume I of Capital appeared in 
London in 1888. Copies of the first two editions (both 1887) were sold at 30s. 
59. Engels means the following passage, referring to the socialist Labor Party of 
North America, in his work 'The labor movement in America'. 'This 
section is a party but in name, for nowhere in America has it up to now, 
been able actually to take its stand as a political party' (see present edition, 
Vol. 26). 
60.Justice, No. 164, 5 March 1887, carried an item by Wilhelm Ludwig 
Rosenberg, secretary of the Socialist Labor Party of North America, head­
lined 'Letter from America - The Great Strike', which characterised the 
longshoremen's strike in New Jersey as an unmitigated defeat for the work­
ers, incurred through the fault of the Knights of Labor leaders. The party, 
Rosenberg stressed, must not support this organisation. The Knights of 
Labor (The Noble Order of the Knights of Labor) was an American work­
ers' organisation founded in Philadelphia in 1869. Originally a secret soci­
ety (up to 1878), it included mostly unskilled workers, among them black 
workers. The Knights' aim was the promotion of co-operatives and mutual 
aid societies. They took part in a number of working-class actions, but the 
organisation's leadership opposed workers' participation in political strug­
gle. It forbade members of the organisation to take part in the 1886 general 
strike; however the rank and file ignored the ban. After the strike the 
Knights' influence among the workers began to shrink. Towards the end of 

=====第544页=====
Notes 533 
the 1890s the organisation disintegrated. 
61. The Central Labor Unions were mass trade union centres of US and foreign 
workers, both white and black, in a number of American cities in the 1880s. 
The first was formed in New York in 1882. Many of these centres joined the 
American Federation of Labor (AFL), set up in December 1886. 
62. The Social Democratic Federation was a British socialist organisation, the 
successor of the Democratic Federation, reformed in August 1884. It 
consisted of heterogeneous socialist elements, mostly intellectuals, but also 
politically active workers. The programme of the Federation provided for 
the collectivisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. 
Its leader, Henry Hyndman, was dictatorial and arbitrary, and his support­
ers among the Federation's leaders denied the need to work among the trade 
unions. In contrast to Hyndman, the Federation members grouped round 
Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling, William Morris and Tom Mann 
sought close ties with the mass working-class movement. In December 
1884,  differences on questions of tactics and international co-operation led 
to a split in the Federation and the establishment of the independent social­
ist league (see note 21). In 1885-86 the Federation's branches were active in 
the movement of the unemployed, in strike struggles and in the campaign 
for the eight-hour day. 
63. In 1886 and 1887 the Social Democratic Federation conducted a broad 
campaign of agitation among London's unemployed. The church parades 
were a form of this agitation, practised in early 1887. It was an attempt to 
address the unemployed from the pulpit. One parade, on 27 February 1887, 
took place in front of St Paul's Cathedral. During the sermon, parade partic­
ipants proclaimed socialist slogans. After the service the Social Democratic 
Federation held three meetings in the streets, the speakers including John 
Burns, George Bateman and Fielding. However, this form of agitation failed 
to produce tangible results and was abandoned. 
64. From mid-November 1886 to 14 August 1887 August Bebel was in prison 
in Zwickau. He was one of a group of German Social Democrats (others 
included Ignaz Auer, Johann Dietz, Georg Vollmar, Karl Frohme) 
condemned on trumped up charges of belonging to a 'secret union' whose 
purpose it was to obstruct by illegal means the enforcement of laws and 
government regulations. The indictment was based on the defendants' 
participation in the 1883 Copenhagen Social Democratic Party Congress. 
The court brought in a verdict of not guilty. However, the government 
appealed to the Imperial Court, which sent the case for re-examination to 
the Saxony State Court in Freiberg. On 4 August 1886 the latter sentenced 
the defendants to various prison terms. In the subsequent two and a half 
years another 55 trials of socialists were staged, resulting in the conviction 
of 236 people. 
65. This refers to Aveling's answer to the article in the New Yorker

534 Notes 
Volkszeitung, No. 10, 12 January 1887 (see note 26). The answer was 
published by the paper on 2 March, Issue 52,1887, alongside another attack 
on Aveling, an editorial headlined 'Affaire Aveling noch einmal'. To this 
second article Aveling answered by a letter dated 16 March 1887, mentioned 
here,  which, as the rough copy shows, had been written by Engels. It was 
published on 30 March, in Issue 76. 
66. In a letter dated 28 February 1887 Sorge informed Engels that a long state­
ment in support of Aveling, signed by K.H. Müller, had appeared in the 
Chicago Arbeiterzeitung. Sorge sent Engels a clipping from the paper. On 
Aveling's second Circular see note 47. 
67. This extract is the last page of Engels's letter to Hermann Schlüter of 19 
March 1887. The whereabouts of the letter are unknown. The text is repro­
duced from a facsimile of a publication in Pionier. Illustrierter Volks-
Kalender fur 1902, New York, 1901. 
68. At the Reichstag elections of 21 February 1887 (see note 15) the Social 
Democrats obtained 11 seats. Under the existing regulations, 15 mandates 
were needed to form a faction. 
69. No information is available concerning this postcard. 
70. Rumours published in the last issue of the Voie du peuple (17 March 1887) 
caused a quarrel and even an exchange of seconds between Albert Goulle, 
who contributed to this newspaper, and Georges de Labruyere, a contribu­
tor to the Cri du peuple. The two then accused each other of trying to evade 
the duel. In publishing its version of the incident, the Cri du peuple, while 
careful to avoid referring to the Voie du peuple by name, suggested that its 
demise had been due to the lack of readers. On 20 March 1887, Le Radical 
published Albert Goulle's and Gabriel Deville's answer to the Cri du 
peuple. 
71. This presumably refers to an item published in the 'Topics of the Day' 
column of the Weekly Dispatch on 20 March 1887 denying the rumours 
about the death of William I. 
72. On 13 (1) March 1887 a group of members of the Narodnaya Volya 
(People's Will), led by Alexander Ulyanov, Lenin's elder brother, made an 
attempt on the life of Alexander III in St Petersburg. The police arrested and 
handed over for trial thirteen people, five of whom, including Alexander 
Ulyanov, were executed, while the rest were given long prison terms. The 
official declaration of the tsarist government referred to by Engels main­
tained that 'some foreign newspapers' were exaggerating the role of the 
constitutional party and that 'the most influential classes in Russia do not 
consider that ... the time is ripe for the introduction of constitutional 
government.' It also declared that the Russian government was 'carefully 
studying state socialism, which is being successfully implemented in 
Germany by Prince Bismarck', and expressed the Tsar's hypocritical regret 
at 'the need for costly precautions to safeguard his personal security'.

73. Engels refers to the political crisis in Bulgaria brought about by the over­
throw, on 9 August 1886, of Prince Alexander Battenberg by a group of 
Russophile military conspirators (see note 109). In an attempt to regain the 
throne, Battenberg sent an obsequious message to Alexander III promising 
every support to the Tsar's 'noble intention to bring Bulgaria out of the 
grave crisis'. The closing sentence read: 'Since it was Russia that gave me my 
Crown, I am prepared to return it into the hands of her sovereign.' 
74. Engels is replying to Trier's letter of 22 March 1887 in which Trier informed 
him that he was sending the manuscript of his Danish translation of Engels' 
The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, and asked for 
Engels' opinion. The translation, revised by Engels, appeared in 
Copenhagen in 1838. 
75. On 25 March 1887 Sorge informed Engels that Hepner had openly 
protested against the accusations levelled at Aveling (see note 3), describing 
them as 'insidious and mean', but saying that the whole thing could have 
been avoided had Aveling been 'more frank'. Sorge also said that according 
to his information Kautsky did not know what to make of the matter and 
Liebknecht kept silent. 
76. The whereabouts of this letter is unknown. 
77. This refers to the attempt on the life of Alexander III which took place on 
13 March 1887 (see note 72) and to the widespread rumours that prepara­
tions for another attempt, to be staged in Gatchina, had been uncovered on 
1 April. 
78. Engels means the replacement of recruitment in Russia by conscription. 
Under the introduction of compulsory military service of 1 January 1874, 
the entire male population aged 21 to 43, with the exception of natives of 
Central Asia and Kazakhstan and men belonging to certain peoples of the 
Caucasus, Siberia, the Volga area and the Arctic regions, were liable for mili­
tary service in the regular army, the reserve or the militia. The call up was 
conducted by casting lots. This system was to turn the Russian army into a 
mass army. However, under the existing autocratic and landlord system, the 
implementation of universal military service was hampered by the numer­
ous privileges of the propertied classes and the unequal conditions of army 
service for members of different social strata. As early as 9 January 1877, 
during the Russo-Turkish war, Engels pointed out that conscription was 
contributing to the 'disorganisation' of the Russian army (see present 
edition, Vol. 45). 
79. At Engels' request Sorge sent a message to Alexander Jonas, Editor of the 
New Yorker Volkszeitung, on 29 March 1877, asking why he was not 
publishing Edward Aveling's letter of 16 March 1887 (see note 65). 
80. On behalf of Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky, the translator of Engels' The 
Condition of the Working Class in England, Rachel Foster, Secretary of the 
National Woman Suffrage Association, was trying to find a publisher for

the book in America. On 8 February 1886 the Executive of the Socialist 
Labor Party, which she had approached for support, set up a special 
committee to deal with publishers, but the negotiations dragged, and the 
book was published in May 1887, independently of the Executive. 
81. At the insistence of the German authorities the Swiss Federal Council on 18 
April 1888 expelled several associate editors of and contributors to the 
Sozialdemokrat (Eduard Bernstein, Julius Motteler, Hermann Schlüter and 
Leonard Tauscher) from the country. Until 22 September the paper contin­
ued to appear in Switzerland, edited by the Swiss Social Democrat Conrad 
Consett. From 1 October 1888 to 27 September 1890 the paper was 
published in London. 
82. Pan-Slavism was a social and political movement predicated on the notion 
that the Slavonic peoples ought to oppose themselves to other peoples and 
merge in a single state with tsarist Russia. In Russia  itself,  Pan-Slavism 
assumed a reactionary character in the 1830s. The Russian historian Mikhail 
Pogodin, drawing on official populism, asserted that the Slavs were superior 
to other nations and that Russia was destined for hegemony in the Slavonic 
world. The same ideas, with various modifications, were propounded by the 
Slavophiles in the 1850s and 1860s (see note 187). 
83. Nihilists were the extreme wing of the radical movement in Russia in the 
1860s, intellectuals who believed in the destruction of existing society and 
culture. The Nihilists rejected the dominant ideology and morality and 
fought against religious prejudices. They demanded freedom of the individ­
ual and equality for women, and favoured the study of the natural and exact 
sciences. Towards the end of the 1860s the term practically ceased to be used 
in polemic literature, but in later years reactionary journalists occasionally 
applied it to revolutionaries. In West European literature the term was used 
to denote Russian revolutionaries, including the members of the Narodnaya 
Volya (People's Will), in the 1870s and 1880s. 
84. After their return from the USA (see note 3) Eleanor Marx-Aveling and 
Edward Aveling launched a large-scale socialist propaganda campaign in 
London's Radical Clubs (see note 22). Their purpose was, among other 
things, to familiarise the British workers with the experience of the US 
labour movement. 
85. At the April 1887 municipal elections in the USA, workers' organisations 
put up candidates in about 60 cities and succeeded in having them elected in 
twenty. In Cincinnati (Ohio), Milwaukee and Chicago their candidates 
failed by a few hundred votes. 
86. In the first half of April 1887 the British House of Commons discussed a 
Crimes Bill for Ireland which was to introduce a simplified judicial proce­
dure for quelling the growing peasant unrest. The executive authorities were 
to be allowed to outlaw various societies, and members of the judiciary to 
pass sentence on charges of plotting, illegal assembly, disobedience to the

authorities and the like without a jury. On 11 April 1887 several mass meet­
ings to protest against the Bill were held in Hyde Park, with 100 to 150 
thousand people attending. The meetings, held separately by different 
organisations, were addressed by speakers for the Liberal Party (William 
Gladstone), the Social Democratic Federation (George Bateman, John 
Burns, Michael Davitt, John Williams and others), the socialist League 
(Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling and others) and other organisa­
tions.  A report headlined 'Irish Crimes Bill, Great Demonstration in Hyde 
Park, Processions and Speeches', in The Daily Telegraph of 12 April 1887, 
said that Eleanor Marx-Aveling's speech was warmly greeted and heard 
with great interest. Despite the protests the two chambers of parliament 
passed the bill in July 1837. Beginning 23 July, a state of emergency was 
introduced on the strength of it, initially in four and ultimately in about 30 
counties of Ireland. 
87. This letter was first published in English in Frederick Engels, Paul and 
Laura Lafargue. Correspondence. 1887-1890, Vol. 2, Foreign Languages 
Publishing House, Moscow, 1960. 
88. This refers to Marx's Misere de la philosophie. In 1884 Laura Lafargue failed 
to reach an agreement on a second French edition of the book. In 1887 Paul 
Lafargue again conducted negotiations on the matter. However, it was not 
until 1896, after Engels 's death, that the project materialised (in Paris). 
89. This presumably refers to the Avelings' series of articles, 'The Labour 
movement in America', published between March and May 1887 in the 
journal Time, which appeared in Swan Sonnenschein's publishing house in 
London. 
90. Engels means the municipal elections in Paris held on 8 May 1887. Lafargue 
stood for election in the Fifth arrondissement (Jardin des Plantes). In the 
first ballot he received 568 votes and was third. In the second, on 15 May, 
he got 685 votes and was second. 
91. After Jules Guesde, Gabriel Deville and other members of the French 
Workers' Party had resigned from the editorial board of the Cri du peuple 
and after the Voie du peuple, the paper they had started, also ceased publi­
cation (see note 18), the Party's weekly La Socialiste likewise closed down 
(the last issue appeared on 26 March 1887). The Party's paper resumed 
publication on 11 June 1887. 
92. On 11 April 1887 the European press reported that another conspiracy to 
assassinate Alexander III had been uncovered. It was to take place during 
the Tsar's inspection of a Guards cavalry regiment. These reports were not 
confirmed (see also notes 72 and 77). 
93. This refers to the Peasant Reform of 19 February 1861 ('Regulations 
concerning Peasants Emerging from Serf Dependence'). It put an end to 
serfdom in Russia and brought freedom to about 22.5 million peasants. 
However, even after the abolition of serfdom some of the former serfs (the 

=====第549页=====
538 Notes 
so called temporarily liable peasants) were obliged to do corvee work or pay 
quit-rent for the use of land. It was not until 28 December 1881 that a law 
was passed stipulating the obligatory redemption of the peasant plots as of 
1 January 1883. Corvee and quit-rent in their open form were abolished, but 
continued to exist in the shape of the redemption system until the first 
decade of the 20th century. 
94. The American economist Henry George favoured a uniform progressive 
state tax on land values as an alternative to nationalisation of the land, thus 
'resolving' all the contradictions of the capitalist system. George's theory 
enjoyed wide currency in the USA, England, Ireland and Australia. Engels 
gave his assessment of George's agrarian views in 'The Labour Movement 
in America' (present edition, Vol. 26). 
95. On 29 May 1887 the third annual conference of the Socialist league (see note 
21) was held in London. Delegates from 24 sections attended. The anar­
chists gained the upper hand; a resolution was adopted saying: 'This confer­
ence endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto 
pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it. 
96. This refers to the fresh wave of government reprisals against Social 
Democrats and the trade unions that swept Germany in 1886, after the third 
promulgation of the Anti-Socialist Law (See Note 52). On 11 April 1886 the 
Prussian minister of the Interior Puttkamer issued a circular on strikes, 
spearheaded against the trade unions. In the spring of that year the author­
ities expelled from Berlin the leaders of the city's stonemasons and 
disbanded their union with a view to paralysing the building workers' 
movement. This was also the lot of three women's unions and all the district 
workers' unions. Workers' mutual aid funds were being closed down and 
their assets, like the trade unions', confiscated by the state. From the begin­
ning of 1878, public meetings in Berlin could only be held with police 
permission. As a result, 47 meetings, including 33 trade union ones, were 
banned that month. Similar measures were taken in the provinces. In the 
early years of the Anti-Socialist Law a number of trumped-up trials of 
Social Democrats were staged, resulting in the imprisonment of prominent 
working-class leaders (see notes 27, 64 and 81). During the Reichstag elec­
tions (see note 15) the workers' party was made the object of terrorist 
attacks. 
97. In her letter of 24 April 1887 Laura Lafargue told Engels that she was 
contributing to the magazine European Correspondent co-owned by the 
American journalist Theodore Stanton and was being paid extremely irreg­
ularly. 
98. Engels received the second circular letter of the Executive of the Socialist 
Labor Party of North America, dated 30 March 1887, from Friedrich 
Adolph Sorge on 18 April. On Aveling's statements see notes 47 and 65. 
Wilhelm Liebknecht issued a statement in defence of Aveling on 16 May.

99. This refers to the 'Schnaebelé case', a conflict between France and Germany 
engineered by the Bismarck government. On 20 April 1887 Police 
Commissioner Schnaebelé, a French border official in Pagny-sur-Moselle, 
was invited onto German territory, ostensibly for negotiations, and arrested 
on charges of organising espionage and encouraging young people in 
Alsace-Lorraine to emigrate from Germany. At the same time, the German 
ruling quarters launched a virulent anti-French press campaign. This was 
taken advantage of by French revanchist circles for stepping up anti-
German propaganda. However, the governments of Russia, Great Britain 
and Austria-Hungary refused to support Bismarck. Germany was forced to 
beat a retreat. On 30 April Schnaebelé was released and the conflict thus 
settled.

letter of 10 March 1887, pointed out that the leaders of the Socialist Labor 
Party of North America had, by their mistaken tactics, to a considerable 
extent nullified the successes achieved in the US labour movement by 
Marx's adherents at the time of the First International. 
102. This refers to the English translation of the Manifesto of the Communist 
Party made by Samuel Moore (published in 1888). The three manuscripts 
mentioned are those of a French translation of Marx's The Eighteenth 
Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (see note 23), an Italian translation of Marx's 
Wage Labour and Capital and a Danish translation of Engels's The Origin 
of the Family, Private Property and the State (see note 74). 
103. An item headlined 'A Costly Apostle', published in Justice No. 172, 30 
April 1887, reproduced the contents of the circulars of the Executive of the 
Socialist Labor Party of North America attacking Edward Aveling (see 
notes 32 and 98). Aveling answered in a Letter to the Editor, published in 
Justice, No. 174. 14 May 1887. 
104. An American exhibition opened in London in May 1887, the programme 
including the show Buffalo Bill's Wild West. 
105. In his letter of 29 April 1887 Eduard Bernstein asked Engels and Kautsky 
to find out, confidentially, whether the Austrian anarchist Joseph Peukert, 
resident in London, was not, as he, Bernstein, assumed, a police agent. In 
late 1887 Peukert was exposed. 
106. This refers to the London German Workers' Educational Society. It was 
founded by members of the League of the Just Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll 
and Heinrich Bauer in London in 1840. In 1847 and in 1849-50 Marx and 
Engels took part in its activities. The Society changed its name in subse­
quent years. From the 1870s it was called the Communist Workers'

Educational society. Soon after the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law 
in Germany (see note 52), the Society was overruled by the faction that 
rejected the tactics adopted by German Social Democracy for the period of 
operation of the Law. It opposed combining legal and illegal methods of 
struggle, objected to the Social Democrats' use of the Reichstag platform 
and favoured individual terrorism. In March 1880 a considerable part of the 
Society's members formed an independent organisation of their own, 
retaining the Society's name. This new Society declared that it would be 
guided by the principles and tactics of German Social Democracy. The 
remainder of the members, in particular the followers of Johann Most, stuck 
to their extreme Left views. They operated under the same name. 
107. This refers to data on the state of affairs in the French republic at the time 
of the conspiracy of the Equals, which Bernstein needed for his Afterword 
to Gabriel Deville's book Gracchus Babeuf und die Verschworung der 
Gleichen. Translated by Bernstein into German, the book was published, 
with his Afterword, in the series Sozialdemokratische Bibliothek, in 
Hottingen-Zurich in 1887. The Conspiracy of the Equals, organised by 
Babeuf and his followers, aimed at provoking an armed uprising of the 
plebeian masses against the bourgeois regime of the Directory and estab­
lishing a revolutionary dictatorship as a transitional stage on the way to 
'pure democracy' and 'egalitarian communism'. The conspiracy was 
exposed in May 1796. At the end of May 1797 its leaders were executed. 
Buonarroti's Conspiration de Babeuf,  which Engels mentions later in his 
letter, was translated into English and published by William O'Brien, a 
prominent Chartist. 
108. Engels's remarks contained in this paragraph were used in the column 
'Sozialpolitische Rundschau' of Der Sozialdemocrat, No. 20, 13 May 1887. 
109. Engels means the political crisis in Bulgaria in the summer of 1886 created by 
the overthrow of Prince Alexander Battenberg by a group of military 
conspirators linked with agents of the Russian Government. The provisional 
government formed on 9 August was replaced, a few days later, by a pro-
Austrian regency. An attempt to re-enthrone Alexander Battenberg failed in 
the face of open opposition from Russia. In September, the Russian 
Government dispatched Major General N.  V. Kaulbars to Sofia with the task 
to prepare the ground for the election of a Russian candidate to the Bulgarian 
throne. However, his mission failed, owing in particular to the stance taken 
by the West European powers, notably Britain. On 5 November Russia 
recalled Kaulbars and broke off diplomatic relations with Bulgaria. 
110. On 31 March 1887 two Bulgarian émigrés staged an attempt on the life of 
Mantoff,  prefect of the Bulgarian city of Ruschtschuk, in Bucharest for 
negotiations with the Russian ambassador. Mantoff was seriously injured. 
On the night of 23 April a bomb was set off in the house of Major  Popoff, 
chief of the Sofia garrison. The attack had been organised by members of

the pro-Russian Liberal Party. The Russophile officer Olimpi Panoff was 
shot in Bulgaria in February 1887. 
111. Kelley-Wischnewetzky had suggested that Engels's article, 'Die 
Arbeiterbewegung in America' ('The Labour Movement in America'), writ­
ten as a preface to the US edition of The Condition of the Working Class in 
England, should be issued in the form of separate German and English 
pamphlets. This was also suggested by Sorge in his letter of 26 April 1887. 
Engels translated the preface into German  himself.  The pamphlets appeared 
in New York in July 1887. Engels's German translation was also published 
in the Sozialdemokrat, Nos 24 and 25; 10 and 17 June 1887. 
112. Engels is quoting from Sorge's letter of 26 April 1887. Enclosed in it was a 
clipping from the New Yorker Volkszeitung of 25 April with a report on a 
sitting of the New York Section that had concerned itself with the Aveling 
case. 
113. In his letter of 26 April 1887 Sorge informed Engels that Alexander Jonas, 
editor of the New Yorker Volkszeitung, had stayed away from the meeting 
of the Executive of the Socialist Labor Party which discussed the Aveling 
case (see note  3). Sorge also noted that the Executive had dealt itself a mortal 
blow by its second circular on the matter (see note 98). 
114. On 21 May \H7, Justice, No. 175, carried an editorial note in the 'Tell Tale 
Straws' column which gave the following resume of Aveling's latest Letter 
to the Editor (see Justice, No. 174, 14 May 1887): 'The gist of it is that the 
Board of Supervisors in America exonerate him from all blame, and that Mr. 
Friedrich Engels, Mr. F. A. Sorge, and Mr. Wilhelm Liebknecht (who writes 
a letter to that effect) are ready to answer for Dr. Aveling's correct behav­
iour in the matter of his expenditure on his American trip'. 
115. Aveling's answer to the second circular of the Executive of the Socialist 
Labor Party (see note 98) was printed in the form of a pamphlet, containing 
Aveling's statement of 27 May 1887 (a detailed reply to the charges levelled 
at him); a statement by Eleanor Marx-Aveling of 24 May, confirming her 
husband's arguments and adding certain details; a statement by Wilhelm 
Liebknecht in defence of Aveling of 16 May. 
116. Six Possibilists (see note 19), including Paul Brousse, were elected to the 
Paris Municipal Council in a second ballot on 15 May 1887. 
117. On 17 May 1887, in a debate at the French Chamber of Deputies, the 
budget committee opposed the draft budget for 1888 submitted by Rene 
Goblet's Radical Cabinet (see note 200). The majority of deputies supported 
the committee, thus forcing the Cabinet to resign. The government crisis 
lasted for 13 days. On 30 May 1887 Maurice Rouvier formed a Cabinet 
composed mostly of Rightists. 
118. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard. The address, written by him on the 
back, reads K. Kautsky Esq., 54 Langdon Park Road, Highgate, No 661. 
The text of the letter is slightly damaged.

120. Engels wrote this letter on a postcard. The address, written by him on the 
back, reads Mrs. F. Kelly-Wischnewetzky, 110, East 76th St., New York, 
U.S. America. For data on the first publication of the letter in English see 
note 139. 
121. An excerpt from this letter was published in English in The Labour 
Monthly, London, 1934, No. 2. 
122. Congregationalists (Independents) - adherents of one of the Protestant 
trends in England. In the 1580s and 1590s they formed the Left wing of the 
Puritans. Consisting of members of the commercial and fledgling industrial 
bourgeoisie and the 'new' bourgeois nobility, they constituted a radical 
opposition to absolutism and the Church of England. During the English 
revolution of the seventeenth century the Congregationalists formed an 
independent political party, which came to power under Oliver Cromwell 
at the end of 1648. The Congregationalists rejected every kind of Church 
deriving from the State. They favoured complete autonomy for every 
congregation of believers and did not tolerate any coercion in matters of 
faith. 
123. Laura Lafargue's French translation of the Manifesto of the Communist 
Party, revised by Engels, was printed in Le Socialiste from 29 August to 7 
November 1885. No separate French edition of the Manifesto appeared in 
Engels's lifetime. 
124. The British Association for the Advancement of Science, founded in 1831, 
still exists. The proceedings of its annual conference are published. The 
Association issues The Advancement of Science, a quarterly journal. 
125. An excerpt from this letter was published in English in: Marx and Engels, 
Ireland and the Irish Question, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1971. 
126. The Commonweal weekly, Nos 71, 72, 74, 76, 79 and 80; 21 and 28 May, 11 
and 25 June, and 16 and 23 July 1887, carried a polemic between Ernest 
Belfort Bax and Charles Bradlaugh on the subject, 'Will Socialism Benefit 
the English People?'. Each author contributed three articles. Bax advocated 
socialism, Bradlaugh opposed it. 
127. Engels means the differences within the Liberal Party and the incipient 
rapprochement of its Right wing (the Whigs) with the Conservatives. The 
Right-wing Liberals opposed Home Rule for Ireland. In 1886 they broke 
away from the Liberal Party and formed the Liberal-Unionist bloc led by 
Joseph Chamberlain. It favoured retaining the 1801 Union of Ireland with 
Great Britain and supported the Conservatives on most issues. Unionist 
Liberals reflected the regrouping of Britain's ruling classes and their shift to 
the Right. 
128. On 19 March 1883 Sorge had informed Engels that Henry George's propa­
ganda in America was leading the working-class movement astray and 

=====第554页=====
Notes 543 
suggested publishing Marx's letter to him, Sorge, of 20 June 1881 (see 
present edition, Vol. 46). The letter contained a critique of George's book, 
Progress and Poverty, published in New York in 1880. However, at the 
time,  Engels held that a publication of Marx's letter in the US would be 
premature. Engels gave a critique of George's views on land nationalisation 
in his Preface to the American edition of The Condition of the Working 
Class in England (see present edition, Vol. 26). 
129. On 8 November 1887 elections to the State legislatures were held in twelve 
US Federal States. Henry George, who stood for election to the post of 
Secretary of State in New York State on behalf of the United Labor Party 
(see note 6), failed. 
130. This letter was first published, in the language of the original (English), in 
Edward Thompson's book, William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary, 
Lawrence and Wishart, London, 1955. 
131. Engels means A Labour Programme, the statement of principles of the 
North of England Socialist Federation, established by Socialist League (see 
note 21) member John Mahon and other socialist workers in 
Northumberland on 30 April 1887. On 14 June Engels received a copy of 
the programme from Mahon with the request to comment on it. Engels sent 
his suggestions concerning the introductory part of the programme (see 
present edition, Vol. 26). They were not put into effect since the Federation 
only lasted a few months. 
132. This letter, like the previous one, is Engels' reply to Mahon. In his covering 
letter to the programme of the North of England Socialist Federation (see 
note 131) Mahon set forth a plan for creating a socialist organisation for 
England and Scotland. This was to be achieved by uniting the various extant 
socialist societies. The constituent congress which was to discuss the 
programme, was to be preceded by broad socialist propaganda within the 
trade unions. Mahon intended to start a special fund for preparing the 
congress and asked Engels for material assistance. 
133. Mahon, who intended to write an essay on the Luddite movement, had 
asked Engels to recommend him relevant material. The Luddites came out 
against the introduction of machinery as ruinous to craftsmen. The 
Luddites were active in the late 18th and early 19th century. They owed 
their name to Ned Ludd, the legendary journeyman supposed to have been 
the first to wreck his knitting machine in protest against his master's arbi­
trariness. 
134. The separate edition of Engels's article The Labor Movement in America 
(see note 12) contains a brief footnote (see present edition, Vol. 26) in which 
Engels refers to the relevant articles by Edward Aveling and Eleanor Marx-
Aveling (see note 89). In this connection Engels states his attitude to the 
anti-Aveling campaign launched by the Executive of the Socialist Labor 
Party (see note 3). The passage to this effect which Engels gives in his letter 

=====第555页=====
544 Notes 
is worded in the footnote as follows: 'I am all the more pleased to refer to 
these excellent articles since this offers me an opportunity simultaneously to 
reject the wretched slanders concerning the Avelings which the Executive of 
the Socialist Labor Party has had the impudence to circulate'. The footnote 
was not reproduced in the separate American edition of this work, but it 
was included in the separate German edition put out in New York in 1887. 
135. Sorge had informed Engels that he had not received the three issues of Time 
containing the Edward Aveling and Eleanor Marx-Aveling's series of arti­
cles on their tour of America, which they had sent him. 
136. In a letter of 16 June 1887 Sorge informed Engels that an advertisement for 
the forthcoming publication by Scribner & Welford (New York) of two 
volumes of Marx's Capital, translated by Samuel Moore and Edward 
Aveling, had appeared in the journal Jahrbücher fur Nationalökonomie und 
Statistik, 1887, Vol. 14, p477. 
137. After his resignation from the post of War Minister, General Boulanger 
continued to whip up a revanchist campaign with the support of the 
chauvinist elements of different parties, from the radicals to the monar­
chists.  On 8 July 1887, when Boulanger was leaving for Clermont-
Ferrand to assume command of the 13th Corps, his supporters staged a 
chauvinist demonstration at the Lyons railway station. Boulangism was a 
reactionary movement in France in the mid-1880s, led by ex-War 
Minister General Boulanger. It urged a revanchist war against Germany 
to win back Alsace, annexed by Germany in the Franco-Prussian war of 
1870-71.  In alliance with the monarchists, the Boulangists sought to capi­
talise on the masses' discontent with the government's policy. Their 
large-scale demagogic propaganda was especially effective among the 
lower ranks of the army. France was under the threat of a monarchist 
coup.  Measures taken by the republican government, with the support of 
the progressive forces led to the collapse of the Boulangist movement. Its 
leaders fled from France. 
138. Engels holidayed in Eastbourne from 23 July to 2 September. 
139. This letter was first published, in the language of the original (English), in 
Briefe und Auszuge aus Briefen von Joh. Phil. Becker, Jos. Dietzgen, 
Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx u. A. an  F. A Sorge und Anders, Stuttgart, 1906. 
140. Kelley-Wischnewetzky had sent Engels clippings from the US (New York 
and provincial) press with reviews of the American edition of the Condition 
of the Working Class in England. 
141. On 21 July 1887 Mahon wrote to tell Engels that he no longer trusted 
Aveling and considered it impossible further to co-operate with him. He did 
not give any reasons. 
142. Aveling and Mahon, along with some other members of the Socialist 
League, opposed the anarchist policies of its leaders (see note 95). 
143. In a letter of 30 July 1887 Kautsky asked Engels to send his signature, a

facsimile of which he wanted to give under Engels' portrait in the annual 
Österreichischer Arbeiter-Kalender for 1888, where Kautsky's article, 
'Friedrich Engels' was to appear. The article was published, with some 
addenda and amendments, after Engels' death, in 1895, in Vorwärts (Berlin), 
under the title 'Friedrich Engels, sein Leben, sein Wirken, seine Schriften'. 
144. Bank Holidays - in 1871 additional holidays were legally introduced for all 
English banks: Easter and Whit Monday, the first Monday of August and 26 
December. 
145. The Austrian Social Democrat Heinrich Mandl questioned the 'iron law of 
wages' in his article '1st das eherne Lohngesetz richtig?' {Gleichheit, No 21, 
14 May 1887). Leo Frankel answered him in an article headlined 'Zur Kritik 
des "ehernen" Lohngesetzes' {Gleichheit, Nos 28-30; 2, 9 and 16 July 1887). 
146. The 'iron law of wages' was formulated by Ferdinand Lassalle, in the 
pamphlet Offnes Antwortschreiben an das Central-Comité zur Berufung 
eines Allgemeinen Deutschen Arbeitercongresses zu Leipzig, Zurich, 1863, 
ppl5-16. 
147. Engels means J.M. Baernreither's book Die englischen Arbeiterverbande 
und ihr Recht. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der sozialen Bewegung in der 
Gegenwart, Bd 1 Tubingen, 1886. The second volume, which was to deal 
with the English trade unions, was not published. 
148. On 27 July 1887 Sorge wrote to tell Engels that Julius Grunzig, associate 
editor of the New Yorker Volkszeitung, had asked him for biographical data 
on Engels, since he intended to write an article on him for the Pionier calen­
dar, published by that newspaper. 
149. On 16 July 1887 Florence Kelley-Wischnewetsky and her husband, Lazar 
Wischnewetzky were expelled from the New York section of the Socialist 
Labor Party of North America for defending Edward Aveling at a section 
sitting (see note 3). 
150. The August 1887 issue of To-Day (Vol. 8, No. 45) contained a note by its 
editor, Hubert Bland, setting forth the contents of Edward Aveling's circu­
lars on the charges levelled at him by the Executive of the Socialist Labor 
Party of North America (see note 3). Bland dealt with the charges 
favourably to Aveling, pointing out that at the bottom of it all was a differ­
ence of policy, as Aveling had advocated a line of action which the Executive 
Committee had disliked. 
151. In connection with the death, on 1 August 1887, of the Russian political 
writer M.N. Katkov, who advocated an anti-German alliance of Russia with 
French chauvinistic circles, the French bourgeois press published a series of 
articles eulogising Katkov as a 'great friend of France'. On the other hand, 
the socialist press exposed Katkov as a reactionary and champion of the 
autocracy. In particular, Jules Guesde, in an article headlined 'Républicains 
et cosaques' {l'Action, 4 August), pointed out that Katkov was responsible 
for the Tsarist government's reprisals against Polish patriots and that revo-

lutionary France must side with the Russian people, fighting for freedom, 
rather than with official Russia. 
152. The elections held in Germany on 21 February 1887 were won by the pro-
Bismarck 'cartel' - the conservatives of both trends and the National-
Liberals (see note 265). The newly formed Reichstag endorsed the septen-
nate demanded by Bismarck (see note 36). It again increased the peacetime 
complement of the army (by more than 40,000) and sharply raised the 
import duties on corn, which made it possible to inflate the military budget 
beyond the special allocations provided by the Reichstag. It was at this time 
that Bismarck coined one of his most bellicose dictums: 'We Germans fear 
God and no one else'. The Schnaebelé case, provoked by Bismarck (see note 
99), further exacerbated the chauvinistic and militaristic passions. A real 
threat of a military conflict arose. 
153. J Guesde's translation of Engels' article The Labor Movement in America, 
written as a preface to the American edition of Engels book The Condition 
of the Working Class in England, appeared in the newspaper Le Socialiste, 
Nos 88, 89 and 90, of 9, 16 and 23 July 1887. 
154. Speaking at Epinal on 24 July 1887, the former French prime minister Jules 
Ferry called Boulanger a 'général de café-concert'. Boulanger challenged 
Ferry to a duel, which, however, did not take place, for the seconds could 
not agree on the terms. On 22 July 1887, the newspaper La France (edited 
by Francis Laur, a Boulanger supporter) carried an article intended to prove 
that at the time of the 'Schnaebelé Affaire' (see note 99) a group of French 
monarchist generals incited Boulanger to stage a coup d'état. Replying in 
the newspaper L'Autorité on 24 July 1887, one of the Bonapartist leaders, 
Paul de Cassagnac, described this report as a lie. Laur challenged him to a 
duel, which also failed to come off. 
155. Apparently this refers to the biography of Engels, written by Karl Kautsky 
for the Österreichischer Arbeiter-Kalender of 1888. 
156. In his letter of 20 August 1887, Bruno Schönlank, a German Social 
Democrat, told Engels about his intention to dedicate to him, Engels, the 
book being prepared for the press Die Further Quecksilber-Spiegelbelegen 
und ihre Arbeiter, of which excerpts had been printed in Neue Zeit, Nos 4, 
5 and 6, 1887. The book came off the press in Stuttgart in 1888. 
157. Joannes Wedde, the editor of the Hamburg newspaper Bürger-Zeitung, 
with whom Engels was in correspondence, applied to him with the request 
to help the FreundschaftsClubs der Zigarren-Sortierer deposit the money, 
saved up by this alliance (10,000 Reichs marks), in the English bank, so as 
to protect this sum against a possible confiscation by the authorities. Wedde 
asked Engels either to deposit this money to his name or help find a man 
who might mediate in this transaction. 
158. Engels wrote this letter on a post card. He indicated the address on the 
reverse side: Monsieur P.  Lavroff,  32 rue S. Jacques, Paris, France.

159. The report about G. Lopatin's death proved wrong. 
160. In a letter of 28 August 1887, Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky voiced her 
regret over the fact that Kautsky, to whom the American editor of the 
Engels-written book The Condition of the Working Class in England, John 
Lovell, had sent a considerable number of copies, did not take the trouble 
to send it to London newspapers and magazines for reviewing. 
161. Characterising the resolution of the conference of the United Labor Party 
of the State of New York, held on 17-19 August 1887, in Syracuse, N.Y. (see 
note 6) on the expulsion of the Socialists from this party, ostensibly in 
conformity with its Rules, Henry George declared in his paper The 
Standard that this decision largely furthered the success of his efforts to 
enlist representatives of the petty bourgeoisie and even big capitalists; as he 
explained, these social groups would have certainly refused to back the new 
independent political movement had it involved the Socialists with their 
'doctrine of the class struggle'. 
162. The American edition of Marx's speech on free trade, which he made in 
Brussels on 9 January 1848 (See present edition, Vol. 6, pp450-65), appeared 
in Boston in September 1888, in Kelley-Wischnewetzky's translation. 
Engels wrote a special preface to this edition - first published in the author's 
translation into the German by the magazine Neue Zeit No 7, July 1888, 
under the title 'Schutzzoll und Freihandel' and then in the English original, 
in the latter half of August 1888, in The Labor Standard of New York. 
Appended as an addendum was the slightly abridged version of the 'Seventh 
and Last Observation' from Chapter II ('The Metaphysics of Political 
Economy') of Marx's work The Poverty of Philosophy (see present edition, 
Vol. 6, ppl74-78). Kelley-Wischnewetzky suggested that the fourth part of 
this chapter, 'Property of Rent'  (ibid.,  pp 197-206) be likewise included in 
the addendum; she argued that the American anarchists, Benjamin Tucker 
in particular, raised a noisy publicity campaign in connection with the 
publication of Proudhon's works they had undertaken. However, Engels 
did not find it necessary to include this part. 
163. In connection with Engels' note to a separate edition of his article 'The 
Labor Movement in America' (see note 134), the Executive of the Socialist 
Labor Party issued a statement published in the newspaper Sozialist, No. 
35, on 27 August 1887. It expressed surprise that a comrade in such an 
exposed position as Engels could not expect such ... accusation against a 
whole number of persons who ... have taken their stand under the circum­
stances...' and also claimed that allegedly none of the sections of the party 
'has come out against the National Executive Committee concerning the 
financial aspect of the matter'. 
164. Apparently the reference is to the convention of the Socialist Labor Party 
of North America (see note 3) held on 17-20 September 1887, in Buffalo, 
NY.

165. The annual 20th Trades Unions Congress, held at Swansea from the 5th to the 
12th September  1887,  passed a decision to set up an independent labour organ­
isation. A meeting convened for the purpose outlined a programme of this 
National Labour Association which was to act as a Labour Electoral 
Committee. Likewise, the Congress adopted a decision on convening, in 
November 1888, an international labour congress in London. For the first time 
ever, the Congress adopted resolutions on nationalisation of landed property, 
and on holding a plebiscite among the trade union members concerning the 
struggle for an eight-hour working day, along with other resolutions. 
166. This letter is a reply to the letter from the editorial secretary of the socialist 
newspaper Londoner Arbeiter-Zeitung, Hugo Koch, of  21 September 1887; 
Koch had asked Engels whether the rumour of his negative pronounce­
ments about the newspaper was correct. 
167. Engels wrote this letter on the letter from Johannes Weiß, written on 9 
October 1887, requesting a long-term loan for the completion of his educa­
tion. 
168. On 6 October 1887, Deputy Chief of the French General Staff General 
Louis Charles Caffarel was dismissed from his post and arrested on a charge 
of selling Legion d'honneur Orders. The investigation revealed that MP 
Daniel Wilson, son-in-law of the President of the Republic, Jules Grévy, 
was one of the chief accomplices of General Caffarel. As a result, General 
Caffarel was demoted, stripped of his decorations and discharged with 
disgrace; Grévy had to retire. 
169. Engels means the pronouncements made by Emile de Girardin, a French 
bourgeois journalist and editor of the newspaper La Presse, in 1846 and 
1847.  E. Girardin accused some of the figures of the July Monarchy and the 
Guizot Ministry of corruption (selling peer titles, bribery of the press, etc). 
His exposures had a role to play in exacerbating the domestic political crisis 
on the eve of the Revolution of 1848. For more details, see Engels' article 
'The Decline and Approaching Fall of Guizot - Position of the French 
Bourgeoisie' (present edition, Vol. 6, pp213-219). 
170. Révolution du mépris - a phrase in use during the February Revolution of 
1848 in France, when the bourgeois-republican quarters presaged a révolu­
tion du mépris ('revolution of contempt) for the corrupt regime of the July 
Monarchy. 
171. On 24 September 1887 a group of Frenchmen on a hunting party near the 
Franco-German border at Raon-sur-Plaine (Vexaincourt), was shot at by a 
German soldier, R. Kaufmann, from German territory; one of the 
Frenchmen was killed, and another wounded. Kaufmann said he had taken 
them for poachers. The German government expressed its regret over the 
incident and pledged to pay an indemnity to the families of the victims. 
172. On 11 June 1887, the newspaper Le Socialiste (2 Serie) resumed its publica­
tion following a break from March  26; its format was considerably enlarged.

173. Bebel visited Engels as guest in the latter half of October 1887. 
174. The Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany was in session 
from the 2nd to the 6th October 1887, at St. Gallen (Switzerland). It was 
attended by 79 delegates. The congress discussed the following questions: a 
report of the Reichstag faction of the party, the activity of Social 
Democratic deputies in the Reichstag and the Landtags, the party's attitude 
to the issue of taxes and customs duties in connection with the steps taken 
by the government in the social sphere, the party's policy at the last election 
and at the election to come, the convocation of an international socialist 
congress, and the attitude to the anarchists. It was stressed in the congress 
resolutions that in its parliamentary activities, the party was to concentrate 
on the critique of the government and on the agitation for the principles of 
Social Democracy; Bismarck's social policies, it was said, had nothing in 
common with the genuine concern for working people's needs. It was also 
pointed out that anarchist views were incompatible with the socialist 
programme. The congress passed a decision to convene an international 
labour congress in 1888 to consider labour legislation. Most of the delegates 
upheld the party's revolutionary wing, led by August Bebel and Wilhelm 
Liebknecht. The leaders of the opportunist wing found themselves in rela­
tive isolation. 
175. Home Rule - this refers to the struggle for Irish self government from the 
1870s to the beginning of the 20th century. Although Home Rule provided 
for an Irish parliament and national bodies of administration, it envisaged 
supreme power being vested with the British cabinet which retained the 
administration of foreign, military and customs affairs. 
176. The British Fabian Society was founded by democratic minded intellectuals 
in 1884. This society was named after the Roman general Quintus Fabius 
Maximus (3rd century B.C.), who was named Cunctator ('the delayer') 
from his cautious tactics in the war against Hannibal. Playing the leading 
part in it were Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Bernard Shaw and others. Local 
organisations of the Fabian society sometimes included working-class 
members. Rejecting notions of militant class struggle and the revolution, the 
Fabians believed it was possible to move from capitalism to socialism by 
means of reforms implemented within the framework of a municipal social­
ism. 
177. Engels wrote this letter on a post card. He indicated the address on the back 
- F. A. Sorge Esq., Rochester N.Y., U.S. America. 
178. The German Social Democrat Congress held at St. Gallen adopted a deci­
sion (along with other resolutions (see note 174)) on convening an interna­
tional labour congress to consider the issue of labour legislation. Almost 
simultaneously, a similar decision was passed by the British Trades Unions 
Congress (see note 165). The trade unions convened their congress in 
London in November 1888; the German Social Democrats abandoned their

plan and took part in the convening and holding of an international social­
ist labour congress in Paris on 14-20 July 1889, first suggested by the French 
Workers' Party (see note 33); it stood at the beginnings of the Second 
International (see note 473). 
179. The reference is to the Social Democratic Federation (See note 62) and the 
Socialist League (see note 21). 
180. The full text of this letter is not available. For first publication in English, 
see note 87. 
181. Here the reference is to the Caffarel-Wilson case (see note 168) in which 
connection Engels recalls the exposures made by the French journalist 
Emile de Girardin in 1846-47 (see note 169). The journalist Albert Eduard 
Portalis, referred to in the letter, was the publisher of the newspaper Le 
XIXe Siècle which was taking a particularly vigorous stand against Wilson, 
and which published a number of materials compromising him. During the 
court trial the dossier, entitled Los antécédents financiers des membres du 
cabinet Rouvier, was stolen from Portalis, and an attack was made on 
Portalis  himself. 
182. In response to the inquiry of the editorial board of Le XIXe Siècle to the 
Paris procurator's office with the demand to give back the documents seized 
during the search le préfet de police offered copies of the documents but 
retained the originals on a formal pretext. 
183. Mme Limouzin (née Scharnet), a favourite of the former War Minister 
General Jean Thibaudin, was arrested in connection with the Caffarel case 
as his intermediary in selling Légion d'honneur Orders. 
184. Early in November 1887, Laura Lafargue wrote to Engels about squabbles 
among some of the members of the Paris branch (agglomération parisienne) 
of the French Workers' Party. 
185. In view of the frequent meetings of the unemployed from the autumn of 
1886 to the spring of 1887, the Chief Constable of London, Charles Warren, 
banned demonstrations and meetings in Trafalgar Square by his fiat of 8 
November, 1887. In reply the Metropolitan Radical Federation (see note 22) 
appointed Sunday, 13 November 1887, as the day of a rally. On that day 
Trafalgar Square was cordoned off by the police and soldiers, and nearly all 
the demonstrators, about a hundred thousand strong, were dispersed with 
exceptional cruelty on their way to the square. Hundreds of workers 
sustained injuries in clashes with the police (with three workers receiving 
deadly wounds); numerous arrests were made. Also taking part in the 
demonstration was Eleanor Marx-Aveling, who described the events of that 
day in the Pall Mall Gazette on the 14th of November 1887. 13 November 
1887 went down in the history of the British working class movement as 
'Bloody Sunday'. 
186. The reference is to the joint meeting of the Social Democratic Federation, 
the Socialist League, the Labour Emancipation League and the London

Radical Clubs in London on 20 September 1885, in protest against the arrest 
of Socialist speakers who had addressed rallies in the East End in July-
September 1885 when the British Socialists were fighting for freedom of 
speech ('the free speech struggles against the police suppression of outdoor 
meetings'). The September 20 rally brought together several thousand who 
offered resistance to the police trying to arrest the speakers. Several people 
were detained nonetheless, but they were set free the next day. September 
27 saw an even larger demonstration and a rally that adopted a resolution 
protesting the police actions. Thereupon the authorities ceased their 
attempts to silence Socialist speakers. 
187. Slavophiles (e.g. A. Khomyakov, the brothers Aksakov, I. Kireevsky, Yu. 
Samarin and others) were a trend in nineteenth-century Russian social and 
philosophical thought. In the late 1830s-1850s they advanced a theory of 
Russia's unique path of historical development which, in their opinion, 
differed from that of Western Europe. Among the characteristic features of 
their theory were monarchism, a negative attitude to revolution and a lean­
ing towards religious-philosophical conceptions. The Slavophiles met 
mostly in the literary salons of Moscow. 
188. On 10 November 1887, die Deutsche Reichsbank announced, on 
Bismarck's orders, that it would no longer accept Russian securities as 
deposits. 
189. It was common practice in the book trade for a publishing house to grant a 
discount to bookstores on wholesale purchases depending on the quantity 
ordered; for example it might offer about 12 copies, a thirteenth part of the 
total print, free of charge. Referring to '18 copies - a thirteenth part - free 
of charge', Engels meant 224 copies of the book sold in Britain. 
190. As Conrad Schmidt told Engels in his letter of 22 November 1887, his rela­
tives in Königsberg had been searched on having received a box with books 
which he, Schmidt, had sent them from Paris during his trip abroad. The 
police tried to prosecute Schmidt on the grounds that the parcel had 
contained several numbers of the newspaper Sozialdemokrat which was 
banned in Germany. He managed to avoid arrest. 
191. From the latter half of September 1841, to about 10 October 1842, Engels 
stayed in Berlin for his tour of duty in an artillery brigade. In his spare time 
he attended lectures at Berlin University and forged close contacts with left-
wing Hegelians, progressive writers and scholars. It was at that time that 
Engels maintained close ties with East Prussian liberals (Eduard Plottwell 
and Johann Jacoby). Through them he might have contacted the bourgeois 
newspaper Königl. Preuß. Staats-Kriegs-und-Friedenszeitung (a progressive 
paper in the 1840s); however, we have no evidence that Engels really co­
operated with the newspaper. 'The restricted intelligence of loyal subjects' 
('beschränkter Untertanenverstand') was a phrase coined by the Prussian 
Minister of the Interior von Rochow; it gained wide currency in Germany.

192. On behalf of Ernst Elsters, preparing a new edition of Heine's works for 
publication, C. Schmidt appealed to Engels on 22 November 1887, with the 
request to clarify some 'mysterious innuendoes' made in Heine's letter to 
Lassalle on 7 March 1846, which was to be included in that edition. This 
letter appeared in the second volume of Heine-Briefwechsels, München-
Berlin, 1917, published by Friedrich Hirth. 
193. As a lawyer, Lassalle conducted Countess Sophie Hatzfeldt's divorce 
proceedings in 1846-54. In February 1848, he was arrested on a charge of 
abetting the theft of a casket with documents with intent to present them to 
the court. Lassalle was held in custody till 11 August 1848, when acquitted 
by the jury. 
194. On 22 November 1887, Conrad Schmidt wrote to Engels that he had read 
with much interest Volume II of Das Kapital; he said if some economic 
newspaper could accept his article on the Marxian system, he would like to 
send it to Engels. It must have been Schmidt's work Die 
Durchschnittsprofitrate auf Grundlage des Marx'schen Werthgesetzes, 
Stuttgart, 1889. 
195. On 3 December 1887, The Commonweal (No. 99) carried an article by 
Henry Ambrose Barker, 'The Condition of the Working Classes. I', which 
was a précis of the first chapters of Engels' book The Condition of the 
Working Class in England; this abstract contained extensive quotations 
from those chapters. There was no continuation of the article. 
196. Engels means Kelley-Wischnewetzky's translation into English of Marx's 
speech on free trade (see note 162). Asking Engels to write a preface to the 
American edition of the Marxian speech, Kelley-Wischnewetzky, in her 
letter of 24 October 1887, wished the preface to contain a critical evaluation 
of pronouncements made by the American protectionists. 
197. The reference is to the resolution of a presidential crisis in France over the 
exposure of speculatory machinations committed by Daniel Wilson, son-in-
law of President Jules Grévy (see note 168). Under public pressure J. P. 
Grévy had to tender his resignation on 1 December 1887. Nominated as 
candidates for the presidency were the moderate republicans M. F. Sadi 
Carnot, Jules EC. Ferry, Charles Louis de Freycinet, among others; the 
ultra Right nominated Félix Gustave Saussier. Ferry's candidacy elicited 
sharp protests from left-wing organisations and Paris workers. The 
Blanquists, headed by Emile Eudes, a former general of the Paris 
Commune, and Edouard Vaillant, a member of the municipal council, 
joined hands with the Guesdists (see note 33) and organised several meet­
ings and demonstrations against Ferry's candidature. After the first round 
of the election Ferry and Freycinet withdrew their candidacies in Marie 
François Carnot's favour, who was then elected president. 
198. Pertaining to the coup attempt of 1877 by Marshall Macmahon, President 
of the Republic, with the aim of restoring a monarchy in France. Yet

Notes 553 
Macmahon found no support among the broad popular masses or in the 
army (among the soldiers and the greater part of commissioned officers), 
which reflected the republican sentiments of the French peasantry. The 
parliamentary election of October 1877 brought victory to the republicans, 
with a bourgeois republican government being formed; in January 1879 
Macmahon resigned. 
199. Opportunists was the name given in France to the party of moderate bour­
geois republicans upon its split in 1881 and the formation of a left-wing 
party of radicals under Georges Clemenceau. The name was first used in 
1877 by Henri Rochefort, a journalist, after the leader of the party, L. 
Gambetta, had said that reforms were to be implemented at 'an opportune 
time'  ('un temps opportun'). 
200. The Radicals were a parliamentary group in France in the 1880s and 1890s 
that emerged from the party of moderate republicans ('Opportunists', see 
note 199). The Radicals relied chiefly on the petty bourgeoisie and to some 
extent on the middle bourgeoisie; they upheld the bourgeois-democratic 
demands: a unicameral system of parliament, separation of the church from 
the state, a progressive income tax, limitation of the workday, among other 
social issues. The Radicals were led by George Clemenceau. This group 
transformed itself into the Republican Party of Radicals and Radical-
Socialists (parti républicain radical et radical-socialiste) in 1901. 
201. On 4 December 1887, London was the scene of several meetings of the 
unemployed, organised by the Social Democratic Federation (see note 62). 
Although significant police reinforcements were moved in, no clashes were 
reported. For an account of the meetings, see Justice Vol. IV, No. 204, 10 
December 1887: The Unemployed Agitation. 
202. Such a collection was not published at the time; in 1894 the Social 
Democratic Publishers Vorwärts released a collection of Engels' works 
under the title Internationales aus dem 'Volksstaat' (1871-75) which 
comprised all the articles mentioned in the letter with the exception of 
Refugee Literature IV. Friedrich Hermann Schlüter also suggested that 
Engels include in the collection some of his articles from Die Neue 
Rheinische Zeitung, Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-Ökonomische 
Revue, as well as excerpts from his pamphlet The Prussian Military 
Question and the German Workers' Party. 
203. Engels replies to F. Schlüter's suggestion to revise three chapters from the 
second part of Anti-Duhring and have them published as a separate 
pamphlet. These chapters, under the single title The Theory of Force 
contained an explanation of materialist views on economics and politics. 
Engels subsequently changed his plan and decided also to add a fourth 
chapter on Germany history from 1848 to 1888 and a critique of Bismarck. 
The proposed title of the pamphlet was The Role of Force in History. Engels 
wrote this (fourth) chapter somewhat later, at the close of 1887 and in the

first three months of 1888. Having interrupted his work in March 1888, 
Engels must have never resumed it. This unfinished work of his, an outline 
of the preface to the pamphlet, the plan of the fourth chapter, as well as the 
plan of the concluding part of this chapter (this plan delineated the contents 
of the unfinished part of the work) are published in the present edition, Vol. 
26. 
204. Engels replies to Paul Lafargue's inquiry in the letter of 25 December 1887, 
concerning Heinrich Oberwinder, formerly active in the First International, 
and exposed as an agent of the Prussian police. The exposure was made by 
Swiss socialists in the newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat on 24 December 
1887;  they had found one of the German émigrés, Christian Haupt, to be 
Bismarck's agent. Subsequently they uncovered other spies as well, includ­
ing Heinrich Nonne and Heinrich Oberwinder. 
205. The Salvation Army was a religious-philanthropic organisation founded by 
William Booth of the Church of England in 1865. Subsequently it extended 
its activities to other countries as well (it adopted the present name in 1878 
upon being reorganised after a military model). 
206. On 25 December 1887, Paul Lafargue told Engels in jest about Laura's 
'new-found talent' as an artist. 
207. The following works of Engels were translated into Romanian: The Origin 
of the Family, Private Property and the State (the journal Contemporanul 
Nos.  17-21,  1885, and Nos. 22-24, 1886) (present edition, Vol. 26) and the 
article The Political Situation in Europe (the journal Revista Socialista No. 
2, December 1886) (present edition, Vol. 26, pp410-17). 
208. The author of both pamphlets, published anonymously, was Constantin 
Dobrogenau-Gherea. 
209. The Holy Alliance was an association of European monarchs founded on 26 
September 1815, on the initiative of the Russian Tsar Alexander I and the 
Austrian Chancellor Metternich, to suppress revolutionary movements and 
preserve feudal monarchies in European countries. 
210. Règlement organique (1831-32) constitutional acts laying down the socio­
political system of the Danubian Principalities (Wallachia and Moldavia) 
after the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-29. The Règlement, based on a draft 
framed by P.D. Kiselev, head of the Russian administration, was adopted by 
an assembly of boyars and clergymen. Legislative power in each of the 
Principalities was vested in an assembly elected by the big landowners. 
Executive power was wielded by hospodars, the titled rulers elected for life 
by representative of the landowners, the clergy and the towns. The 
Règlement envisaged a number of bourgeois reforms: abolition of internal 
customs duties, introduction of free trade, and the right of peasants to move 
from one owner to another. However, in view of the preservation of  serf­
dom and concentration of political power in the hands of the big landown­
ers and boyars, the progressive forces in the Principalities regarded the 

=====第566页=====
Notes 555 
Règlement as a symbol of feudal stagnation. Reimposed in 1849 during the 
occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia by Russia and Turkey, the Règlement 
became invalid with the setting up of an independent Romanian state in the 
1860s. 
To suppress the revolutionary movement in Wallachia and Moldavia, 
Russia and Turkey sent in their troops in the summer of 1848. By the Balta-
Liman Treaty of 19 April  (1 May) 1849, the occupationist regime was to be 
in force till after the revolutionary threat had been eliminated in full (the 
foreign troops were withdrawn only in 1851); as a provisional measure, the 
hospodars were to be appointed by the Turkish Sultan with the consent of 
the Russian Tsar. Also, Turkey and Russia were to take steps, not excluding 
another military intervention, in case of repeated revolutionary unrest. In 
keeping with the Bucharest Peace Treaty of 12 May 1812, virtually all of 
Bessarabia up to the River Pruth was ceded to Russia. By the Paris Treaty 
of 1856 Turkey annexed a portion of this territory. However, in accordance 
with the Berlin treaty of 1878, this part of Bessarabia was ceded back to 
Russia. 
211. An excerpt of this letter was first published in the language of the original 
(English) in the book: K. Marx, F. Engels, Letters on 'Capital', London, 
1983. 
212. In his letter of 11 (23) December 1887, Nikolai Danielson told Engels that 
Volume IV of Johannes v. Keussler's work Zur Geschichte und Kritik des 
bäuerlichen Gemeinbesitzes in Rußland had come off the press. These four 
volumes, he pointed out, were the only reliable source of data based on the 
relevant statistical and economic studies of the Russian zemstvos. Danielson 
regretted that Keussler undertook his work after only 20 volumes of the 
total 100-volume edition of the extensive statistical study of the zemstvos 
had seen print. 
213. In the same letter Danielson wrote to Engels about the institution of a State 
Land Bank for the Nobility in Russia. The State Land Bank for the Nobility 
was set up in 1885 with the aim of helping the Russian landed proprietors 
from among the nobility in the maintenance of their estates. The landown­
ers could get loans from this bank on fairly easy terms by mortgaging their 
land. The tsarist government provided substantial financial assistance to this 
bank. Loans were issued on a long-term basis and at a lower interest rate 
than in other Russian banks. 
214. The Peasant Land Bank was a state mortgage bank instituted in Russia in 
1882 for providing long-term loans to peasant farmers for land purchases. 
Catering to the interests of the big landowners, the bank charged high inter­
est rates. Its activity resulted in soaring land prices. The land of insolvent 
real estate owners who failed to pay off the loans on time was auctioned off 
by the bank or sequestered into its land pool. The Peasant Land Bank was 
operating in close contact with the State Land Bank for the Nobility set up

in 1885 (see note 213) and became a vehicle of the reactionary agrarian poli­
cies pursued by the tsarist government. As a consequence, a significant part 
of the land found itself in the hands of the rich gentry and the rural bour­
geoisie. One sequel to this process was the further stratification of the peas­
antry. 
215. The reference is to 'marginal utility theory', the counter of vulgar political 
economics to the labour theory of value, whereby the value of commodities 
is deduced from the calculation of their utility and value. The marginal util­
ity theory evolved into a major theoretical system in the 1870s. Its main 
advocates in the late 19th and early 20th century were Karl Menger, Eugen 
Böhm-Bawerk (of the Austrian School), William Stanley Jevons, and others. 
See also Engels' Preface to Volume III of Capital (present edition, Vol. 37). 
216. In August 1887, Nikolai Danielson informed Engels of Lopatin's death in 
the Schlüsselburg Fortress. Engels immediately applied to Lavrov with the 
request to verify this report. It proved to be wrong. 
217. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in the book: K. 
Marx and F. Engels, Correspondence, 1846-1895, London, Lawrence 1934. 
218. From September 1887 to March 1888, Friedrich A. Sorge lived in Rochester, 
N.Y.,  i.e., where his son did. 
219. The Bismarck government followed a dual policy with regard to the work­
ers: along with the continued repression (see note 96) it tabled, on 17 
November 1881, a new programme of social legislation to be considered in 
the Reichstag. Although adopted by the Reichstag, this programme was 
implemented very slowly and inconsistently. In 1883 the Reichstag passed a 
law on a mandatory sickness insurance, in 1884 a law on old age and disabil­
ity insurance. The entrepreneurs contributed only a 1/3 to the social insur­
ance fund, with the other 2/3 being drawn from the employees. The issue of 
a shorter workday and of restrictions on female and child labour was not 
considered. 
220. In view of the expiration of the Anti-Socialist Law (see note 52), the 
Bismarck government tabled a motion (November 1887) to prolong it for 
another five years and supplement it with some new clauses with stiffer 
penalties for the promulgation of socialist literature and for membership in 
Social Democratic unions, to the extent of banishment and deprivation of 
citizenship (expatriation). 
221. The Thirty Years War (1618-1648) was a European war in which the Pope, 
the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs and the Catholic German princes 
rallied under the banner of Catholicism and fought the Protestant countries: 
Bohemia, Denmark, Sweden, the Republic of the Netherlands and a number 
of Protestant German states. The rulers of Catholic France - rivals of the 
Habsburgs - supported the Protestant camp. Germany was the main battle 
arena or the object of plunder and territorial claims. The Treaty of 
Westphalia (1648) sealed the political dismemberment of Germany.

222. Probably Wilhelm Liebknecht wrote in his letter to Engels that in case of a 
prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law (see note 52) he and his family 
would have to emigrate to America. One of the additional clauses to the law 
envisaged banishment and deprivation of citizenship (expatriation) for 
Social Democratic activities (see also note 220). 
223. Engels means the leaders of the Socialist Labour Party of North America 
(see note 3). 
224. An allusion to the events of 'Bloody Sunday' in London's Trafalgar Square 
on 13 November 1887 (see note 185). Among those arrested were the 
prominent figures in the socialist and trade union movement Robert 
Cunninghame-Graham and John Burns. On 18 January 1888, the two men 
were sentenced to 6 weeks' imprisonment. However, they were soon set 
free under public pressure (see note 246). 
225. An excerpt from this letter was first published in the preface to Marx-Engels 
Gesamtausgabe. Dritte Abteilung, Bd. 1, 1929. 
226. On 30 December 1887, Hermann Schlüter told Engels about Eduard 
Bernstein's request to allow Der Sozialdemokrat to publish the final part of 
the Engels-written introduction to S. Borkheim's pamphlet Zur Erinnerung 
für die deutschen Mordspatrioten 1806-1807 pending the publication of the 
pamphlet  itself.  On 15 January  1888,  Der Sozialdemokrat carried the second 
part of the Engels introduction under the title Was Europa bevorsteht. The 
booklet was printed in June 1888. 
227. The German Social Democratic archives were set up at the Zurich 
Conference of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany held on 19-21 
August 1882. Their purpose was to preserve the manuscripts of prominent 
figures in the German labour movement (including the works of Marx and 
Engels), and documents pertaining to the history of Germany and the inter­
national working-class movement, and the labour press. The initial site of 
the archives was Zurich. The first materials were collected by Eduard 
Bernstein. From April 1883 the archives were in the custody of Hermann 
Schlüter. In June 1888, following the expulsion of some members of the 
Sozialdemokrat editorial staff and co-workers from Switzerland (see note 
81), the archives were moved to London and, after the abrogation of the 
Anti-Socialist law (see note 52), to Berlin. 
228. In his letter of 30 December 1887, Schlüter wrote to Engels that the book 
dealers had cut the journal Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische 
Revue into separate pieces and sold these articles separately as independent 
works. Meanwhile, longer works of Marx and Engels were printed in instal­
ments in different numbers of the journal. 
229. The reference is to the manuscript of The Great Men of the Exile written by 
Marx and Engels (see present edition, Vol. 11, pp227-326). At the end of 
June 1852, Marx passed on the manuscript to the Hungarian emigre, 
Kossuth's emissary abroad Janos Bangya, who offered to have it published 

=====第569页=====
558 Notes 
in Germany. Later, it turned out that Bangya was a police spy who had 
handed over the manuscript to the Prussian police. The actions of Bangya, 
who managed to win Marx's confidence for a time, were unmasked by Marx 
in his article 'Hirsch's Confessions' written in April 1853 and published in 
American newspapers (see present edition, Vol. 12, pp40-43). The reference 
is to the following part of the pamphlet Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol. 
17, pp219-20): Karl Bruhn made slanderous accusations against Marx and 
Engels by claiming they had allegedly sold the MS of the pamphlet to the 
Prussian police (see present edition, Vol. 42, pp 117-118). 
230. Early in 1887 Pasquale Martignetti, an Italian socialist, approached Engels 
with the request to help him find work outside Italy as he was being perse­
cuted for his views (see note 8). Engels, through the mediation of Johannes 
Wedde, editor of the Hamburg-based Social Democratic newspaper Bürger-
Zeitung, tried to find a job for Martignetti, but failed in his attempt. 
231. Martignetti's letter to Engels (dated 3 January 1888) was accompanied by 
the issue of the journal Mefistofele, carrying the first instalment of the 
Italian translation of Engels' biography written by Karl Kautsky. 
Martignetti intended to continue the publication in this journal of excerpts 
from Kautsky's work and then have it published in full as a separate 
pamphlet. For this reason he asked Engels to look through the translations 
in the Mefistofele and send him comments on the translation. The Engels 
biography was published in the journal between 1 January and 30 
November 1888. 
232. In February 1886 P. Martignetti sent his Italian translation of Marx's Wage 
Labour and Capital for Engels to peruse. However, because of his work on 
the English edition of Volume I of Capital, and his eye disease, Engels was 
unable to read the Italian translation immediately. It was published in Milan 
only in 1893. 
233. The reference is to Engels' article Prussian Schnapps in the German 
Reichstag (see present edition, Vol. 24, ppl09-27). The publication of this 
work, exposing the Prussian Junkers, in the newspaper Volksstaat and in the 
form of a reprint, caused exasperation in government quarters. Therefore 
the promulgation of Engels' works in Germany was banned. 
234. In his letter of 5 February 1888, Paul Lafargue informed Engels about the 
cessation of the publication of the newspaper Socialiste, an organ of the 
French Workers Party (Guesdists), on 4 February of the same year (see note 
33). 
235. The debates in the Reichstag about the motion to prolong the Anti-Socialist 
law (see note 52) in January-February 1888 ended in a defeat for the govern­
ment. This outcome was largely predetermined by the speeches of August 
Bebel (30 January and 17 February) and Paul Singer (27 January and 17 
February) during the first and the third reading of the draft bill, respec­
tively. Both speakers exposed the provocative activities of the government

which was planting spies in the labour unions. On 17 February 1888, the 
Reichstag prolonged the law for the last time, but not for a term of five 
years,  as the government had suggested - the action of the law was extended 
for two years only (until 30 September 1890). The new clauses suggested by 
the government for the law were not adopted (see note 220). 
236. An allusion to the entry of Napoleon's troops into Berlin in 1806 following 
the defeat of the Prussian forces, at Jena and Auerstedt. 
237. An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in the journal The 
Socialist Review, London 1908, III-VIII. 
238. The reference is to a scandal over the criminal actions of Louis Charles 
Caffarel and Daniel Wilson (see note 168). In 1847, just before the 
Revolution of 1848, there were many scandalous exposures of cases of 
corruption involving French statesmen (see note 169). For Révolution du 
mépris (a revolution of contempt) see note 170. 
239. An excerpt from this letter was first published in the language of the origi­
nal (English) in the book Briefe und Auszüge aus Briefen von Joh. Phil. 
Becker, Jos. Dietzgen, Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx u. A. an  F. A. Sorge und 
Andere. Stuttgart, 1906. 
240. The first American edition of The Manifesto of the Communist Party 
(reprint of the English translation from the Red Republican) under the title 
Manifesto of the German Communist Party (without the names of the 
authors being mentioned) was published by Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, 
New York, 30 December 1871. 
241. As Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky wrote to Engels, the attitude of the 
German socialists in New York to his book The Condition of the Working 
Class in England was tantamount to a boycott. Engels described the 
Executive of the Socialist Labour Party of North America, with Lassalle's 
supporters in it, as 'the official German socialists of New York'. (See note 3). 
242. The Law and Liberty League was set up on 18 November 1887, after the 
Trafalgar Square demonstration (see note 185). The League united repre­
sentatives of labour radical clubs, socialist organisations, trade unions affil­
iated with the Fabian Society, etc. Active in the League were: Eleanor Marx-
Aveling, Edward Aveling, William Morris, John Burns, Sidney Webb, and 
others. The League championed freedom of speech and assembly, and came 
out for independent representation of working men in Parliament. The 
League ceased its activities in February 1888 because of the differences 
among its members. 
243. An excerpt from this letter was first published in the language of the origi­
nal by the journal Die Kommunistische Internationale No. 24, 1931; in 
Russian it appeared in the journal Kommunisticheski Internatsional, Nos. 
19-20,  1931. 
244. An allusion to William O'Brien's speech in the House of Commons on 16 
February 1888, with scathing criticism of the policy of Arthur Balfour,

Secretary of State for Ireland and nephew of the Prime Minister, Mr Robert 
Salisbury. 
245. Speaking in the Reichstag on 6 February 1888, in debates on a draft bill 
providing for reorganisation of the German armed forces, Bismarck lauded 
the pro-German policies of Alexander III in contrast to the anti-German 
pronouncements of some organs of the Russian press. Still, he spoke in 
favour of a stronger military might for the German Reich in view of a possi­
ble anti-German alliance between France and Russia. By calling Alexander 
III a 'Gatchina prisoner', Engels referred to the fact that, ascending the 
throne after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II by members of the radi­
cal organisation Narodnaya Volya ('People's will') on 1 March 1881, 
Alexander III feared revolutionary action and fresh acts of terrorism, so 
used to seclude himself in his palace at Gatchina. 
246. On 19 February 1888, a big rally was held in London on the occasion of 
liberation of the socialists Robert Cunninghame-Graham and John Burns, 
convicted for taking part in the Trafalgar Square demonstration of 13 
November 1887 (see note 185). 
247. The Commonweal, the organ of the Socialist League, reprinted a list of 
police agents promulgated in Der Sozialdemokrat under the heading 
Polizeiagent - Dynamitagenten with 12 police agents in it (see note 204). 
The newspaper augmented this list without giving cogent proof of the 
culpability of the persons mentioned, including Theodor Reuß. 
248. Landwehr was the army second reserve formed in Prussia during the strug­
gle against Napoleon. In the 1840s it consisted of men under forty who had 
done three years of active service and had been in the reserve not less than 
two years. In contrast to the regular army, the Landwehr was called up only 
in case of extreme necessity (war, or threat of war). 
249. The Fenians were Irish revolutionaries who named themselves after the 
'Féne', a name for the ancient population of Ireland. Their first organisations 
appeared in the 1850s in the USA among the Irish immigrants and later in 
Ireland  itself.  The secret Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, as the organi­
sation was known in the early 1860s, aimed at establishing an independent 
Irish republic by means of an armed uprising. The Fenians, who expressed the 
interests of the Irish peasantry, came chiefly from the urban petty bourgeoisie 
and intellectuals, and believed in conspiracy tactics. The British Government 
attempted to suppress the Fenian movement by severe police reprisals. 
250. The Orange Order, named after William III, Prince of Orange, was an 
organisation set up in Ireland in 1795. The English authorities, the landlords 
and the Protestant clergy used this organisation to fight the Irish national 
liberation movement. The Order united English and Irish elements from all 
strata of society and systematically incited the Protestants against the Irish 
Catholics. The Orangemen had a particularly great influence in Northern 
Ireland, where the majority of the population were Protestants.

251. The reference is to the manifesto of Frederick III on the occasion of his 
ascension to the throne on 12 March 1888. This proclamation - An mein 
Volk (To my people) - was marked by the same date as his message to 
Chancellor Bismarck. 
252. On 18 March 1888, the newspaper Weekly Dispatch published the mani­
festos of Frederick III ('Letter to Prince Bismarck', 'Proclamation of the 
Emperor') (see note 251). 
253. Engels alludes to the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78. 
254. In his letter to Engels of 18 March 1888, Paul Lafargue expressed his convic­
tion that the only chance of preventing General Boulanger from being 
elected to the Chamber of Deputies would be to abrogate the balloting 
procedure 'according to the lists', introduced in June 1885 instead of the 
former procedure providing for voting 'in small arrondissements'. The new 
system of balloting, effected in keeping with departmental lists, envisaged 
integration of small constituencies into larger ones, each corresponding to a 
department in size. A voter would be offered a list of candidates from vari­
ous parties, and was supposed to cast his ballot for the overall number of 
candidates due to be elected as deputies in a given department (proceeding 
from the ratio: 1 deputy to 700,000 of the population). An absolute major­
ity of votes was needed in the first round for a candidate to be elected, but 
he could do with a relative majority in the  runoff. 
255. The Vendôme Column was erected in Parts between 1806 and 1810 in trib­
ute to the military victories of Napoleon I. It was made of bronze from 
captured enemy guns and crowned by a statue of Napoleon; the statue was 
removed during the Restoration but re-erected in 1833. In the spring of 
1871,  by order of the Paris Commune, the Vendôme Column was destroyed 
as a symbol of militarism. 
256. An abridged version of this letter was first published in English (in facsim­
ile) in the book Literary Heritage 1932, No.2; and in full it was published 
in: Marx K., Engels F. Literature and Art, New York, Intern. Publ., 1947. 
257. Legitimists were the party who supported the French Bourbon dynasty 
(overthrown in 1792); they represented the interests of the big landed aris­
tocracy and the top clergy; they took shape as a party and assumed this 
name in 1830, after the second overthrow of the Bourbon dynasty. During 
the Second Republic, the Legitimists, together with the other monarchist 
parties, formed the Party of Order. Failing to win support from the people 
under the Second Empire, they confined themselves to marking time and 
issuing critical pamphlets and were galvanised into action only in 1871, 
when they joined the general counter-revolutionary onslaught against the 
Paris Commune. 
258. Engels refers to the uprising in Paris of 5-6 June 1832, prepared by the Left 
Wing of the Republican Party and secret revolutionary societies. The imme­
diate cause of this uprising was the funeral of General Lamarque, who had 

=====第573页=====
562 Notes 
been in opposition to the government of Louis Philippe. The revolutionary 
workmen raised barricades and fought back with great courage and tenac­
ity. One of the barricades, put up in rue Saint-Martin (formerly the site of 
the Saint-Méri cloister) was among the last to fall. In his novel Illusions 
perdues and story Les secrets de la Princesse de Cardignan, Balzac depicted 
a republican Michel Chrestien who 'died at the walls of the cloister Saint-
Méri ('mourut au cloître Saint-Mérri'). Balzac called him a 'great statesman 
who could have changed the face of the world' ('ce grand homme d'Etat, qui 
peut être eût changé la face du monde'). 
259. The reference is to Paul Lafargue's article 'La langue française avant et après 
la Révolution' published in the journal Nouvelle Revue, t. 51, 1888, under 
the nom de plume Fergus. As is apparent from Lafargue's letter to Engels 
on 27 November 1887, this article was conceived as part of a larger work in 
which he intended to look into changes that had occurred in matters of 
property, philosophy, art, etc., after the French Revolution. 
260. Boustrapa - nickname of Louis Bonaparte, composed of the first syllables 
of the names of the places where he and his supporters staged Bonapartist 
putsches, or coups: Boulogne (August 1840), Strasbourg (October 1846) and 
Paris (coup d'état of 2 December 1851). 
261. An allusion to a scandalous incident involving the British colonel Valentine 
Baker who had seduced a young girl in a railway carriage and was brought 
to trial. Engels compared this incident in jest to the rape of Europa when 
Jupiter, in love with the young Phoenician princess Europa, assumed the 
form of a white bull to carry her off. 
262. For British Association for the Advancement of Science see note 124; for 
the materials of the discussion mentioned by Engels, see Report of the Fifty-
Seventh Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 
held at Manchester in August and September 1887, London, 1888, pp885-
95. Engels usually familiarised himself with the materials of the 
Association's annual meetings by means of publications in the journal 
Nature. 
263. The reference is to a bill tabled by Roger Quarks Mills at US Congress in 
April 1888 on rescinding taxes on raw materials used in industry and on 
reducing duties on many import items. The bill was not adopted. 
264. Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky and her husband, Dr Lazar 
Wischnewetzky, both expelled from the New York section of the Socialist 
Labour Party of North America in July 1887 (see note 149), did not agree 
with the decision of the Executive and pressed for reinstatement of their 
membership in the party. On 31 March 1888, the newspaper Wochenblatt 
der N. Y. Volkszeitung carried a report on the Executive sittings of 2, 9 and 
16 March 1888, which decided first to study the additional evidence before 
discussing the Wischnewetzkys' appeal. 
265. The Kartell was a coalition of conservative parties - die Deutsch-

=====第574页=====
Notes 563 
Konservative Partei, die Deutsche Reichspartei (Freikonservative) und die 
Nationalliberale Partei - which was formed after Bismarck had dissolved the 
Reichstag in January 1887 (see note 15). Supporting the Bismarck govern­
ment, Kartell won the election of February 1887 by obtaining the largest 
number of seats in the Reichstag (220). Assisted by the coalition, Bismarck 
was able to secure the passage of reactionary laws in the interests of the 
Junkers and the big bourgeoisie (imposition of protectionist tariffs, higher 
taxes,  etc.) (see note 152). However, he could not get the Reichstag to prolong 
the Anti-Socialist Law. The exacerbation of differences among the parties 
affiliated with the Kartell and the electoral defeat of 1890, with only 135 seats 
secured in the Reichstag, resulted in the disintegration of the coalition. 
266. A reference to the intended marriage of Victoria, the daughter of Frederick 
III, to Prince Alexander Battenberg of Bulgaria, who occupied the 
Bulgarian throne in 1879-86 and steered a policy hostile to Russia. Fearing 
a worsening of Russo-German relations, Bismarck opposed the marriage. 
267. Believing that the Bismarck regime was in for a political crisis, Engels 
considers, by way of comparison, the landmark stages of the political crisis 
of the Second Empire in France: The Mexican period of Bonapartism - the 
abortive armed intervention of France in Mexico (1862-67) with the aim of 
suppressing the Mexican revolution. The military expedition incurred huge 
expenses and caused grave damage to the empire of Napoleon III. 1866 - the 
defeat of Austria in her war against Prussia deprived Napoleon III of an 
essential ally in the confrontation with Prussia. 1870 - the routing, on 1-2 
September, of French troops at Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War of 
1870-71.  The Sedan debacle speeded up the collapse of the Second Empire 
and led to the proclamation of a republic in France on 4 September 1870. 
268. Engels means Die Erklärung der Sozialdemokratischen Föderation 
Englands in Sachen des nach London einberufenen internationalen 
Gewerkschaftskongresses which was published by the newspaper 
Sozialdemokrat on 14 April 1888. The Declaration came in view of the 
intended convocation by the British trade unions of an international 
congress of labour unions in November 1888 (see note 165). The Decla­
ration was a response to the protest of the German Social Democrats against 
the decision of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Unions 
Congress of Great Britain (see note 269) on conditions for representation at 
the Congress: only delegates officially elected by trade unions were to 
attend. Thereby the German Social Democrats were unable to take part on 
account of the enforcement of the Anti-Socialist law in Germany. In its 
Declaration the Social Democratic Federation voiced its discontent at the 
protest of the German Social Democrats. 
269. The reference is to the rapprochement of the leadership of the Social 
Democratic Federation (see note 62) and the Possibilists (see note 19). 
Starting in 1884, the Federation, acting through its organ Justice, conducted 

=====第575页=====
564 Notes 
a broad campaign in support of the Possibilists; it recognised them as the 
principal organisation of French Socialists and maintained no relations with 
the French Workers' Party (see note 33). The Social Democratic Federation 
was the only socialist organisation to support the Possibilist International 
Congress in Paris in 1889 (see note 478). An allusion to the Parliamentary 
Committee, an executive body of The Trades Union Congress of Great 
Britain formed in 1868 and uniting the British trade unions. As of 1871 the 
Parliamentary Committee was annually elected by Trades Union 
Congresses as a steering body of the trade unions in between the congresses. 
It was designed to nominate trade union MPs, support draft bills tabled in 
the interests of the trade unions, and prepare regular union congresses. 
Henry Broadhurst was the parliamentary Committee's Secretary from 1875 
to 1890. In 1921 the Parliamentary Committee was replaced with the Trades 
Union Congress General Council. 
270. The Congress of the German Social Democratic Party at St Gallen (see note 
174) passed a decision to convene an international labour congress in 1888. 
However, the party's Executive stated its readiness to refrain from the 
convocation of that congress and to participate in a congress being 
convened in London by the Parliamentary Committee of the British Trades 
Unions (see note 165). Following its unsuccessful negotiations with the 
Parliamentary Committee which had stipulated unacceptable conditions for 
representation of German Social Democracy at the London congress, the 
party's Executive reverted to the resolution of its congress. 
271. Probably the reference is to the work of Johann Georg Eccarius Eines 
Arbeiters Widerlegung der national-ökonomischen Lehren John Stuart 
Mill's republished by the Social Democratic Publishers of Zurich in 1888. 
Originally written in English for the journal The Commonweal 
(10.11.1866, 27.3.1867), it first appeared in German in 1869 as a pamphlet in 
Eccarius' translation. 
272. In this letter to Engels on 11 April 1888, P. Martignetti said he was offered 
a job in the archives of the Italian town of Benevento, but had to pass 
competitive examination to be able to qualify. 
273. Engels sent Lafargue's letter on 27 April 1888, addressed to Wilhelm 
Liebknecht, pertaining to the preparation of an international labour 
congress. P. Lafargue believed that in this way his letter would reach the 
addressee the sooner. 
274. A brief excerpt from this letter was first published in French by the journal 
La Pensée, No. 61, 1955. For the first publication of this letter in English, 
see note 40. 
275. In March-April 1888 a peasant uprising broke out in Romania's central 
districts. The rebels burned landlords' estates, destroyed promissory notes, 
and divided bread, cattle and land amongst themselves. The revolts were 
crushed brutally by the government.

276. This letter was first published in English by the journal Istoricheskv Arkhiv 
(Historical Archives), No. 2,1956 (the facsimile of the first page) and in full 
in: F. Engels, P. and L. Lafargue, Correspondance, T. 2 (1887-1890), Paris, 
1956. 
277. The French Socialists differed in their attitude to Boulangism (see note 137). 
Some of them, including P. Lafargue, at first erroneously qualified 
Boulangism as a 'popular movement' with little regard for the aims of this 
movement and Boulanger's personality. The Workers' Party majority with 
Jules Guesde at the head and the greater part of the Blanquists led by M.E. 
Vaillant adhered to a policy of non-interference with respect to Boulangism 
by regarding this movement only as a bourgeois party; they said they were 
loath to intervene in partisan strife among the bourgeois parties. Yet the 
sectarian stance of non-interference isolated the party from the popular 
masses and gravely prejudiced its influence in the home country. 
278. The decree adopted by the German Ministry of the Interior on 22 May 
1888,  prohibited free passage of the French into Alsace and Lorraine. All 
foreigners crossing into Germany from France were supposed to have pass­
ports with a visa from the German embassy in Paris. 
279. This letter was first published in English in: Frederick Engels, Paul and 
Laura Lafargue, Correspondence, Vol. 3 (1891-95), Supplement Letters, 
Moscow, 1963. 
280. Engels, at the request or Karl Kautsky, and Eleanor and Edward Aveling, 
was translating poems by Shelley into German for the Avelings's article 
'Shelley als Sozialist', published in the December issue of Neue Zeit in 1888. 
281. Refers to the voyage of Engels, Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling and 
their friend Carl Schorlemmer to the United States where they spent over a 
month - from 17 August to 19 September 1888. They journeyed from New 
York to Boston and nearby towns, then on to the Niagara Falls and across 
Lake Ontario to Canada. Engels made this tour incognito, without meeting 
German Socialists or representatives of the press. 
282. On 12 June 1888, Georges Boulanger addressed the Chamber of Deputies 
demanding its dissolution and a revision of the Constitution. The head of 
the government, Charles Floquet, proposed that Boulanger's demand be 
turned down and pointed out to the general's unseemly activities. Accusing 
Floquet of slander, Boulanger presented the Chairman of the Chamber with 
a waiver, framed in advance, whereby he relinquished his mandate as a 
deputy; the matter culminated in a duel in which Boulanger was wounded. 
283. Plebiscitary Boulangism was a description that Engels gave to Boulanger's 
attempt to obtain a deputy's mandate from many departments of France. 
Making use of the voting 'according to the lists' (see note 254), Boulanger 
nominated his candidacy in any department where a deputy's seat happened 
to be vacant. As soon as a new vacancy was open, Boulanger relinquished 
his mandate so as to run for Parliament in another department. Boulanger

hoped that with the aid of such tricks he would appear an elected represen­
tative of the entire nation. Boulanger's victory at the election of 1889 
compelled the French government as early as 31 January 1889 to table a 
draft bill on restoring the old system of balloting in electoral constituencies. 
This bill was approved and came into effect on 13 February. On 17 July 
1889 Parliament passed yet another law whereby no one could be elected 
deputy other than in one constituency only.

Bernstein Esq., 4, Corinne Road, Tufnell Park, N. London.

F. A. Sorge, Hoboken, New  Jersey.  For the first publication of the letter in 
English see note 29. 
286. This letter was first published in English in Science and Society, Vol. 2, No. 
3, 1938. It was written on hotel notepaper with the address: Adams House, 
No. 553, Washington Street, Boston. 
287. The reference is to the dissent in the Socialist Labour Party of North 
America (see note 3). Speaking of the resignation of the Executive Secretary 
Wilhelm Rosenberg, Engels proceeded from a report made by Friedrich 
Sorge in his letter of 30 August 1888. The official decision on Rosenberg's 
resignation was adopted in September 1889 (see note 501). 
288. The letter was written on hotel notepaper with the address: Adams House, 
No.553.  Washington Street, Boston. 
289. The letter was written on hotel notepaper with a picture of the Niagara Falls 
and the address: Spencer House, Niagara Falls, N.Y. 
290. Engels stayed in London in July-August 1838 when he accompanied his 
father on a business trip to Britain. That was the first trip of the young 
Frederick Engels abroad (see present edition, Vol. 2, pp99-100)

sheet. 
295. In the autumn of 1841 Bruno Bauer, one of the leaders of the Young 
Hegelians, was suspended from teaching at Bonn University by Eichhorn, 
the Prussian Minister of Religious Worship, Education and Medicine. In 
March 1842, he was dismissed from his post as lecturer in theology on 
account of his atheistic views and opposition speeches. Bauer's dismissal 
evoked sharp protests from radical and liberal intellectuals.

296. Telling Engels about his intention to obtain the post of senior lecturer at 
Leipzig University, Conrad Schmidt wrote: 'Whether I will succeed in 
getting a position in Leipzig is doubtful to me in view of the personal atti­
tude of Mr "Thucydides" Roscher to Marx'. Speaking ironically, Marx and 
Engels called Professor Roscher by the name of the great historian of the 
ancient Greece, Thucydides, for, as Marx wrote, Herr Professor Roscher 
had modestly declared himself a Thucydides of political economy (see 
present edition, Vol. 32, p570). See Roscher's preface to the first edition of 
his work Die Grundlagen der Nationalökonomie 1854. 
297. On 23 August 1888 Conrad Schmidt wrote to Engels that he was not eligi­
ble as lecturer at Halle University on account of his atheist views. 
298. In his preface to Volume II of Capital that appeared in 1885 Engels suggested 
that economists clarify the question 'in which way an equal average rate of 
profit can and must come about, not only without a violation of the law of 
value, but on the basis of it' (see present edition, Vol. 36). Marx had offered 
a solution to this problem in Volume III of Capital on which Engels was 
working at the time. Having taken an interest in the problem raised by 
Engels, C. Schmidt was working on the book Die Durchschnittsprofitrate 
auf Grundlage des Marx'schen Werthgesetzes which came out in 1889. In the 
review of Volume II of Capital - Die Marx'sche Kapitaltheorie - published 
by the journal Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik, new series, 
Vol. XI, 1885, Wilhelm Lexis likewise raised this problem, though he could 
offer no solution. Engels made a circumstantial appraisal of these works in 
his preface to Volume III of Capital (see present edition, Vol. 37). 
299. W. Roscher, Geschichte der Nationalökonomie in Deutschland München, 
1874,  S. 1021-1022. In it Roscher gave an evaluation of the Marxian 
economic theory. 
300. On 20 September 1888 the newspaper New-Yorker Volkszeitung carried 
Engels' interview with Theodor Cuno (see present edition, Vol. 26, pp626-
27), formerly a member of the First International. Acting on the assignment 
of the editor-in-chief Alexander Jonas who had learned about Engels' 
sojourn in New York (see note 281), Cuno had the interview published 
without prior consultations with Engels. In October 1888 this interview 
was reprinted by Der Sozialdemokrat. 
301. A fragment of this latter was first published in English in K Marx, F. Engels, 
V. I. Lenin, The Communist View on Morality, Moscow, Novosti 
Publishers, 1974. 
302. Engels probably meant the leaders of the Fabian Society - Sidney and 
Beatrice Webb, George Bernard Shaw, Edward Pease (see note 176). 
303. Following their abortive attempts in the 1870s to form a party of their own, 
the Austrian Socialists remained split into several groups for many years. 
There were also anarchist and moderate radical groups besides the adher­
ents of scientific socialism among them. The above groups were divided on

such issues as the significance and nature of workers' political activity 
(specifically, the parliamentary struggle), the makeup of the party, ethnic 
problems, and so on. A reunification attempt was undertaken in Vienna in 
the first half of 1887. Of much significance in this respect was a party 
congress of the Czechoslovak Socialists late in 1887 which passed a decision 
on forming a single Social Democratic Party. The Austrian Social 
Democrats held their unity congress from 31 December 1888 to 1 January 
1889 at Hainfeld. They put an end to the party's division into organisations 
representing separate lands and separate ethnic groups. The party 
programme adopted by the congress relied on Marxist postulates. 
304. Engels intended to write travel notes of his tour of the United states, as 
shown by an excerpt from Notes on My Journey Through America and 
Canada (see present edition  Vol.  26), as well as by rough notes which Engels 
wrote in the latter half of September 1888, evidently, aboard the steamship 
City of New York. In them Engels planned to give his assessment of the 
country's social and political life. This intention was not realised. 
305. August Bebel intended to write a large work on Wilhelm Weitling in which 
he also wanted to take up the subject of 'the social movement of the 1840s'. 
He applied to Engels with the request to help in the collection of material. 
306. Weitlingian communists held to a doctrine of egalitarian Utopian commu­
nism that gained wide currency among German artisans, especially among 
tailors in Paris. Being a progressive movement in the early 1840s, before the 
development of modern Socialist ideas, the Weitling doctrine (with its nega­
tion of the need for an active political struggle of the proletariat and its 
emphasis on sectarian, conspiratorial methods of struggle) became to some 
extent a hindrance to the growing class consciousness of the German work­
ers The reactionary characteristics of the Weitling doctrine, gradually taking 
on a religious-Christian colouring, became increasingly manifest. Weitling's 
supporters, always suspicious of 'scholars' (i.e. revolutionary intellectuals), 
would in their practical activities confine themselves to projects involving 
communes, partially borrowed from Fourier and his followers, and to 
small-scale experiments like establishing collective canteens, etc. In May 
1846 Marx and Engels, with their adherents, broke from Weitling. Engels, 
living in Paris in 1846-47, had regular and stubborn discussions with work­
ers to explain the backward nature of Weitling's views. 
307. The reference is to German, or 'true socialism' which became widespread in 
Germany in the 1840s, mostly among intellectuals. The 'true socialists' -
Karl Grün, Moses Hess and Hermann Kriege - substituted the sentimental 
preaching of love and brotherhood for the ideas of socialism and denied the 
need for a bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany. Marx and Engels 
criticised this trend in the following works: The German Ideology (see 
present edition, Vol. 5), Circular Against Kriege, German Socialism in Verse 
and Prose and Manifesto of the Communist Party (Vol. 6).

308. A reference to Georg Kuhlmann's book Die Neue Welt oder das Reich des 
Geistes auf Erden Verkündigung, Geft, 1845. For a critique of this book, see 
present edition, Vol. 5. 
309. This refers to Weitling's letter to Moses Hess on 31 March 1846, in which 
he describes the sitting of the Brussels Communist Correspondence 
Committee held on 30 March 1846, culminating in its breaking of relations 
with Marx and Engels. The controversy flared up over the best way of 
carrying on propaganda in Germany. Marx wanted to prove that calling on 
the workers to rise up without a proper programme was to deceive them 
and could result in dire consequences for the entire movement. Pavel 
Annenkov's reminiscences of this meeting were originally published in 
Russian. An excerpt from these reminiscences (one about Annenkov's meet­
ings with Marx) was reproduced by the journal Neue Zeit, No. 5, 1883, 
under the heading 'Eine russische Stimme über Karl Marx'. 
310. A reference to the two volumes of a quarterly journal the publication of 
which was negotiated in 1845 and 1846 by a number of Westphalian social­
ists, the publishers Julius Meyer and Rudolph Rempel among others. Marx 
and Engels intended to publish in it their criticism of the German ideology 
which they started to write in the autumn of 1845. It was also planned to 
publish a number of polemical works to their colleagues, in the first place 
those containing criticism of German philosophical literature and the works 
of the 'true socialists'. In November 1845 Moses Hess reached agreement 
with Meyer and Rempel on financing the publication of two volumes of the 
quarterly. Further negotiations were conducted by Weydemeyer, who 
visited the Brussels Communist Correspondence Committee. In a letter to 
the Committee of 30 April 1846 from Schildesche (Westphalia) he wrote 
that no headway was being made and proposed that Meyer should form a 
joint-stock company in Limburg (Holland), as manuscripts of less than 20 
printed sheets were subject to preliminary censorship in Germany. He also 
recommended that Marx should sign a contract with the Brussels publisher 
and bookseller CG. Vogler for the distribution of the quarterly and other 
publications. The contract was not drawn because Vogler could not assume 
even part of the expenses. Weydemeyer continued his efforts, but succeeded 
in getting from Meyer only a guarantee for the publication of one volume. 
However as early as July 1846 Meyer and Rempel refused their promised 
assistance on the pretext of financial difficulties, the actual reason being 
differences in principle between Marx and Engels, on the one hand and the 
champions of 'true socialism', on the other, whose views both publishers 
shared. Marx and Engels did not abandon their hopes of publishing the 
works, if only by instalments, but their attempts failed. The only chapter of 
The German Ideology known to be published during their lifetime was 
Chapter IV of Volume II, which appeared in the journal Das Westphälische 
Dampfboot in August and September 1847 (publisher of this journal was O.

Lüning). The rest of the existing German Ideology was first published in the 
Soviet Union in 1932. 
311. Engels means Weitling's non-extant work Allgemeine Denk-und 
Sprachlehre nebst Grundzügen einer Universalsprache der Menschheit 
which was written in the first half of the 1840s. 
312. The fifth and sixth points at the résumé in Weitling's letter were as follows: 
'5. It is necessary to combat "artisan communism" and "philosophical 
communism" and to criticise the idea that everything is a fantasy. There 
should be no propaganda by word, no secret propaganda. The very word 
propaganda should no longer be used. The realisation of communism is 
now out of the question. First the bourgeoisie must take the helm'. 
313. A reference to L. Stein, Der Socialismus and Communismus des heutigen 
Frankreichs, Leipzig, 1842; K. Grün, Die soziale Bewegung in Frankreich 
und Belgien, Darmstadt, 1845. Marx and Engels made a critique of like 
publications in The German Ideology (see present edition, Vol. 5, pp484-
530).  At the beginning of 1845 Engels and Marx had formed the plan to 
publish in Germany a 'Library of the Best Foreign Socialist Writers' with a 
general introduction and commentaries to each issue (see Engels' letters to 
Marx of 22-26 February, 7 and 17 March 1845). The draft plan of this publi­
cation, drawn up by Marx (see present edition, Vol. 4, p667), shows that it 
was conceived as a representative series of works of French and English 
authors. The plan was not carried out because of publishing difficulties, 
apart from the translation of a few chapters of Fourier's Des trois unités 
externes (see present edition Vol. 4, pp613-44). 
314. Engels was working on Chapter III of Volume III of Capital at the time. 
For more detail, see Engels' preface to Volume III of Capital (present 
edition, Vol. 37). 
315. An allusion to P. Lafargue's article 'Die Beschneidung, ihre soziale und 
religiöse Bedeutung', published by the journal Neue Zeit, No. 11, 1888. 
316. A reference to P. Lafargue's article intended for the newspaper Der 
Sozialdemokrat and containing a critique of the views of the Possibilists (see 
note 19). On Engels' advice Lafargue abandoned his plan to have it 
published. 
317. Bourses du travail, Labour Exchanges - institutions set up in France largely 
as local government bodies in major cities, consisting of representatives of 
various trade unions. Originally they were assisted by state bodies in a bid 
to divert the workers from the class struggle - not infrequently, in the form 
of financial aid. The labour exchanges provided jobs for the unemployed 
and led to the founding of new trade unions. 
318. There was a marked trend in the late 1880s toward a rapprochement 
between part of the Blanquists and the Boulangists. Victor Henri Rochefort, 
a prominent figure in the Boulangist movement, described Blanquists as 
'our friends' in pronouncements made for his newspaper Intransigeant; 

=====第582页=====
Notes 571 
they were nominated with the Boulangists in common electoral lists. A 
group led by Ernest Roche and Ernest Granger separated itself from the rest 
of the Blanquists and gave open and vigorous support to General 
Boulanger. 
319. The reference is to the proposed calling of an International Working Men's 
Congress in Paris in 1889. The Possibilists (see note 19) received powers to 
organise this congress from the 1886-held Paris International Conference 
which they had sponsored and which involved representatives of the British 
trade unions, delegates from German Social Democracy, and the workers' 
parties of Belgium, Austria-Hungary, Sweden and Australia (about this 
conference, see note 333). 
320. The reference is to the London International Congress of Trades Unions 
held on 6-10 November 1888 at the initiative of the British trade unions. 
The congress involved trade union representatives of Britain, Belgium, 
Holland, Denmark, Italy as well as French syndicates aligned with the 
Possibilists. Stipulating that delegates to this congress should be officially 
elected by respective trade unions, its organisers thereby deprived the 
German and Austrian. Social Democrats, as well as representatives of the 
French Workers' Party (the Guesdists), see note 33, of an opportunity to 
attend. Yet the leaders of the British trade unions failed in their attempts to 
foist reformist decisions on the congress and isolate it from the Socialists. 
The congress adopted a number of positive decisions. Thus, the workers 
were not to confine themselves to forming purely professional organisa­
tions - they were to unite into an independent political party as well. One 
of the resolutions stressed the need to press for legislative regulation of the 
working day and working conditions. In its most significant decision, the 
congress resolved to convene an International Working Men's Congress in 
Paris in 1889; organisation of this congress was entrusted to the 
Possibilists. 
321. The National Congress of French Labour Unions (syndicates) held on 23 
October - 4 November 1888 (see note 331) adopted a decision on conven­
ing an International Working Men's Congress in Paris in 1889. 
322. Troyes was the proposed venue of a convention of the Workers' Party of 
French Socialist-Revolutionaries (the Possibilists) (see note 19). The organ­
isers of the congress - local party functionaries - invited representatives of 
the Guesdists to attend as well. However the Paris Possibilists, fearing that 
the Guesdists might be in a majority, refused to take part (see also note 329). 
323. The reference is to Chapters III and IV of Volume III of Capital, (see 
present edition, Vol. 37). 
324. Excerpts from this letter were first published in French in the journal La 
Pensée, No. 61, 1955. Concerning the first publication of this letter in the 
language of the original (English), (see note 40). 
325. The newspaper Parti Ouvrier, the mouthpiece of the Possibilists (see note

19), on 28 December 1888 carried an article 'L'Agglomération parisienne' 
that accused the Guesdists of lending support to the Boulangist movement 
(see note 277) so as to have Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue and Gabriel Deville 
in Parliament. The Paris Amalgamation {Agglomération) was the name of 
the Paris branch of the French Worker's Party. 
326. In her letter to Engels of 27 December 1888 Laura Lafargue wrote that the 
anti-Boulangism of the Possibilists was similar to their other deception. 
They used to good advantage the pronouncements of the Guesdists in 
support of the international and, specifically, the German working-class 
movement and, as a result, the latter lost its popularity in Paris. For the 
Guesdists' attitude to Boulangism see note 277. 
327. Cadettists was the name by which members of the Société des Droits de 
L'Homme et du Citoyen were known. The Society was set up on 25 May 
1888 by bourgeois radicals and moderate republicans for combating 
Boulangism. The Possibilists became affiliated with this organisation. Its 
name came from Rue Cadet, where it was located. 
328. In view of the death, on 23 December 1888, of the deputy to the Chamber 
from Seine-Department, Antoine Auguste Hude, the Prime Minister 
Floquet fixed a by-election on 27 January 1889. 
329. The convention of the French Workers' Party held in Troyes in December 
1888 (see note 322) passed a decision on nominating a socialist as an inde­
pendent candidacy for the by-election of 27 January 1889. The candidature 
of Boulé, a labourer and stonemason, was nominated accordingly. This 
convention also decided to hold an International Socialist Working Men's 
Congress in Paris in 1889, thus confirming the decision of the National 
Congress of the French trade unions (see note 331). 
330. On 29 December 1888 Wilhelm Liebknecht told Engels he intended to visit 
Paris and London to hold preliminary negotiations with local socialists 
about the forthcoming International Socialist Congress in Paris. 
331. The National Congress of the French Trade Unions took place on 23 
October-4 November 1888. It represented 272 labour unions - the workers' 
syndical chambers and industrial groups. Most of the delegates belonged to 
the revolutionary wing of the French workers' movement. The congress 
had been opened in Bordeaux, but its sessions had to be transferred to Le 
Bouscat after the police declared the congress disbanded because of a red 
banner over its rostrum. The congress passed a decision to convene an 
International Socialist Working Men's Congress in Paris in 1889 to 
commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution Also discussed was 
a general strike, considered to be the only revolutionary way. 
332. The funeral of the Paris Commune general Emiles Eudes on 8 August 1888, 
developed into a mammoth demonstration of the Paris proletariat; its 
participants carried red flags and posters urging a new commune. This 
demonstration was dispersed by the police.

Notes 573 
333. Engels refers to the Paris International Conference convened by the French 
Possibilists in 1886 (see note 319). The conference discussed issues related 
to international labour legislation. Its resolutions denied the need for work­
ing-class political struggle. 
334. Engels alludes to the Ninth Congress of the Party of the Possibilists at 
Charleville on 2-8 October 1887. The main issue on the agenda was partici­
pation in electoral campaigns. 
335. An allusion to the French Revolution of 1789-99. 
336. The reference is to the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in France, first 
in May 1814 and then in July 1815. After the defeat of Napoleonic France 
in the war against the sixth coalition, Napoleon had to abdicate in April 
1814,  and the Bourbons were restored to power. Louis XVIII became King 
of France. In March 1815, Napoleon regained power, but his rule did not 
last long ('The Hundred Days'). Following his defeat at Waterloo by British 
and Prussian troops, he again abdicated on 22 June 1815 and Louis XVIII 
was again restored to the throne  (8 July) with the help of the foreign armies. 
337. The reference is to the sum assigned by the King in 1825 as compensation 
for aristocrats whose property had been confiscated during the French 
Revolution. 
338. 'Tranquillity is the first duty of the citizen' is a dictum coined by the 
Prussian minister Schulenburg-Kehnert in his address to the population of 
Berlin on 17 October 1806 following the defeat at Jena {Le Moniteur 
universel, No. 304, 31 October, 1806, 'Prusse', Berlin, du 18 octobre). 
339. In these letters Conrad Schmidt told Engels that his own attempts to obtain 
a position of senior lecturer at Leipzig University failed because of his 
socialist views. 
340. As assistant professor at Berlin University, Eugen Dühring, beginning in 
1872,  criticised the university professors, Hermann Helmholtz in particular, 
and the University customs in general. Such criticism riled the reactionary 
faculty which started hounding Dühring. In July 1877 he was deprived of 
the right to teach at the University. His dismissal sparked vigorous protests 
from his supporters and was condemned by the public. 
341. The reference is to the monographs on the history of Germany's national 
economy under the heading Staats- und socialwissenschaftliche Forschungen 
edited by Gustav Schmoller in 1878-1916, and in co-operation with Max 
Sering as of 1903. Containing a wealth of factual and historical evidence, 
these publications offered no theoretical analysis at all. This series mirrored 
the views of the 'young historical school' in Germany's political economy, 
a trend led by Schmoller. Its followers thought the chief task of political 
economy was to collect factual material on the history of the national econ­
omy, with theoretical analysis being left to the generations to come. 
342. 'Demagogues' was the name given to participants in the students' opposi­
tion movement in Germany after the country's liberation from Napoleonic

rule.  The name gained currency after the Karlsbad Conference of Ministers 
of the German States in August 1819, which adopted a special decision on 
the persecution of the Demagogues. 
343. This letter was first published, abridged in English by the journal Labour 
Monthly, London, 1934, No. 3. 
344. In the by-election scheduled for 27 January 1889 in Paris (see notes 328, 
329),  the following candidacies were nominated: Georges Boulanger - from 
the Right-wing groups, Edouard Jacques - from the Republican Party (this 
candidature received support from the Possibilists as well), and the labourer 
Boulé - from the Workers Party (see note 33) and the Blanquists. In a bitter 
electoral struggle, General Boulanger received about 250,000 votes, Boulé 
7,000 votes. 
345. This refers to the Baden-Palatinate uprising of 1849 in Germany. For greater 
detail, see Engels' The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution, 
present edition, Vol. 10, ppl47-239. 
346. The French Section of 1871 (branche française) was formed in London in 
September of that year by French refugees. The leaders of the Section estab­
lished close contacts with Bakunin's followers in Switzerland. The Rules of 
the French Section of 1871, published in Qui Vive. 1, its official organ, were 
submitted to the General Council at its extraordinary meeting on 16 
October 1871 and referred to a special committee. At the General Council 
meeting of 17 October, Marx tabled a resolution on behalf of the commit­
tee (present edition, Vol. 23, pp24-27), recommending the Section to bring 
several paragraphs of its Rules into line with the Rules of the International. 
In its letter of 31 October, signed by A. Avrial, the Section rejected the 
General Council resolution. This reply was discussed in the commission 
and at the General Council sitting of 7 November 1871. Auguste Serraillier, 
Corresponding Secretary for France, submitted a resolution written by 
Marx, which was unanimously adopted by the Council (see present edition, 
Vol. 23, pp37-42). In December 1871, the French Section split up into 
several groups. The 'pseudo-General Council' applies to a group within the 
British Federal Council; this group, led by John Hales, Hermann Jung and 
others, refused to act on the decisions of the Hague Congress and was 
expelled from the International on 30 May 1873. 
347. In September 1888 the German Professor Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken had 
the journal Deutsche Rundschau publish excerpts from the diary of the 
German Emperor Frederick III, a close friend of  his. These excerpts, dating 
back to the time of the Franco-Prussian War of  1870-71,  showed Bismarck's 
role in the building or the German Empire in an unfavourable light. 
Bismarck had criminal proceedings initiated against the professor who was 
charged with high treason. The Reichsgericht acquitted Professor Geffcken 
on 4 January 1889; on the following day he was released from custody. At 
about the same time Herbert von Bismarck, the Reichskanzler's older son,

accused the British diplomat Morier of mediation between Frederick, then 
the crown prince, and France. Morier countered by publishing his corre­
spondence with Marshal Bazaine of France, through whom he had ostensi­
bly been passing information on the German army. These materials showed 
up the slanderous nature of the charges. The progressive press viewed the 
acquittals of Geffcken and Morier as major defeats for Bismarck. 
348. In December 1888 a Russian loan with a 4 per cent interest rate was issued 
in Paris to a sum of 125 million roubles, or about 20 million pound sterling. 
349. In connection with an apparent rapprochement between France and Russia, 
Bismarck initiated negotiations on a defensive alliance with Great Britain in 
January 1889; these negotiations involved colonial issues as well. Britain and 
Germany were supporting each other in East Africa in putting down popu­
lar uprisings in Uganda and Zanzibar. The British and German navies, 
acting together, imposed a blockade on the eastern coast of Africa. At a later 
date,  on 1 July 1890, Britain and Germany concluded a treaty which defined 
a boundary between their possessions in East Africa. In addition, Britain 
agreed to cede to Germany the strategic island of Heligoland in the North 
Sea. However this rapprochement did not result in a solid alliance and 
imperialist rivalry subsequently led to a sharp deterioration in Anglo-
German relations. 
350. Lewis Morgan's book Ancient Society, or Researches in the Lines of Human 
Progress from Savagery, through Barbarism to Civilization appeared in 
London in 1877. Marx and Engels thought highly of this work; in 1884 
Engels wrote his The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, 
In the Light of the Researches of Lewis H. Morgan (see present edition, Vol. 
26). Meanwhile, Morgan's works did not win due recognition among British 
scholars and were ignored for a long time. 
351. At Paul Lafargue's request Engels approached the leaders of the German 
Social Democratic Party to learn their opinion concerning the forthcoming 
International Socialist Working Men's Congress. In this letter he informed 
Lafargue about the replies of August Bebel of 8 January 1889 and Wilhelm 
Liebknecht of 11 January 1889. 
352. A preliminary conference, scheduled for 18 January 1889 at Nancy and 
suggested by representatives of German Social Democracy, did not take 
place. 
353. Engels refers to the manuscript of Theories of Surplus Value, written by 
Marx in 1862-63 and being the only outline of the concluding, historical-
critical part of Capital. Engels could not prepare book IV of Capital in his 
lifetime: Marx's MS of Theories of Surplus Values was first published by 
Karl Kautsky in 1905-10, i.e., after Engels' death (see present edition, Vol. 
38 for a revised version). 
354. Louise Kautsky was attending obstetrics classes. 
355. Laura Lafargue informed Engels about the termination of the publication of

the Blanquist newspaper Le Cri du Peuple and about the foundation of a 
new organ, the newspaper Egalité. Its editorial committee comprised repre­
sentatives of the revolutionary wing (the Guesdists) - Jules Guesde, Paul 
Lafargue, Gabriel Deville; the Blanquists were represented by Edouard 
Vaillant, Ernest Granger and Place; the Possibilists - by Benoît Malon; and 
the Independent Radicals - by the municipal councillors Alexandre Abel 
Hovelacque and Boulé. Its first number came out on 8 February 1889. At 
first Egalité carried articles by Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue and other 
Marxists. But as early as 3 March of the same year the Guesdists and the 
Blanquists, collaborating on the editorial  staff,  broke with Jules Roques, an 
entrepreneur financing the paper (see note 380). From that time on Egalité 
ceased to be an organ of the Socialists. 
356. Engels means the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) when 
Napoleon Bonaparte imposed a military dictatorship; also, the election, on 
10 December 1848, of Louis Bonaparte to the presidency in France. On 12-
13 Vendémiaire (4-5 October) 1795, the government troops under General 
Bonaparte crushed a royalist uprising in Paris. 
357. August Bebel's report, carried in the feature 'Deutschland' and marked 'Aus 
Norddeutschland, 29, Jänner', was published anonymously by the newspa­
per Gleichheit No. 5, on 1 February 1889. 
358. The reference is to the editorial article 'Boulanger en Bourgeois Republiek', 
carried by the Hague-based newspaper Recht voor Allen and to the report filed 
by Souvarines in  Parijsche  Brieven, XV and published on  1 February 1889. 
359. An allusion to the article 'Que faire?' ('What is to be done?') written by 
Charles Longuet and published by the newspaper Egalité on 10 February 
1889.  In it he attacked the Radicals (see note 200) for their alliance with the 
Opportunists (see note 199). 
360. A reference to the International Socialist Conference in the Hague 
convened on 28 February 1889 (see note 385). 
361. Atherley Jones was the son of Ernest Jones, one of the leaders of the 
Chartist revolutionary wing, approached Engels through John Lincoln 
Mahon and asked for help in publishing his father's works. 
362. The abridged text of this letter was first published in English in Karl Marx 
and Frederick Engels, Selected Correspondence, London, Lawrence and 
Wishart, 1956. 
363. 14 July 1789 - the day of the storming of the Bastille by the popular masses 
of Paris and the beginning of the French Revolution. On 5-6 October 1789, 
the popular masses, who had come to Versailles from Paris made King Louis 
XVI return to the capital from which he had fled. The monarchy in France 
was toppled on 10 August 1792 as a result of a popular uprising. There was 
mass unrest in Paris on 2-5 September 1792, caused by an onslaught of 
foreign interventionist troops. Parisians seized prisons and staged 
impromptu trials of the inmates: many were executed.

364. A reference to the Commune of Paris in 1789-94. Formally being no more 
than a body of municipal self-government, the Commune from 1792 actu­
ally guided the struggle of the people of Paris in the revolution. The 
Commune played an active part in the overthrow of the monarchy, in the 
imposition of a Jacobin dictatorship, in the introduction of a price maxi­
mum, in the adoption of a 'law against suspects' (i.e. against the counter 
revolutionaries), etc. Following the overthrow of 9 Thermidor (27 July 
1794) most of the Commune members, supporters of Robespierre and his 
adherents, were executed. The Commune was thereafter abolished. 
365. At Fleurus (Belgium) on 26 June 1794, French troops defeated the Austrian 
army under the Duke of Coburg. This victory enabled the French revolu­
tionary army to enter and occupy Belgium. 
366. Francois Noel (Gracchus) Babeuf was a French revolutionary and advocate 
of Utopian egalitarian communism based on the ideas of natural law. 
367. Preparing his notes on Kautsky's article, Engels translated excerpts from 
Nikolai Kareyev's article., 'Peasants and the Peasant Problem in France', 
expressly for the author; Engels gave the full names of the sources which 
Kareyev had indicated in an abbreviated form. 
368. By the Second Partition of Poland (12 /23/ January 1793) Russia gained 
eastern Byelorussia and the Ukraine on the right bank of the Dnieper; 
Prussia acquired Gdansk, Torûn, part of Great Poland, Mazovia and of the 
Krakow province. 
369. This refers to the mandates and complaints (cahiers de doléances) sent to 
deputies of the General States at the time of the French Revolution by 
representatives of the French 'third estate' who were reduced to penury. 
The General States (États généraux) were the highest body of estate repre­
sentation in France in a period from the fourteenth to the eighteenth 
century. 
370. Constituante - the Constituent Assembly (Assemblée nationale constitu­
ante) of France which was in session from  9 July 1789 to 30 September 1791. 
371. A fragment of this letter was first published in English by Labour Monthly, 
London, 1934, No. 3, and in full in Marx K., Engels F., Letters to Americans. 
1848-1895, A Selection, International Publishers, New York 1953, I.E. Mins 
(trans). 
372. Engels might have made a mistake by indicating the date, 19 January. He 
meant the post card of 29 January and the letter of 10 February, sent by 
Friedrich Sorge, who called Engels' attention to F. Kelley-Wischnewetzky's 
article on child labour, carried by the newspaper The Labour Standard on 
19 and 26 January 1889. 
373. On 29 January 1889, F. Sorge sent a cutting from the New York newspaper 
Standard to Engels with an advertisement announcing a sale of the English 
edition of Volume I of Capital by the American book dealers Appleton and 
Co.

374. In his letter of 10 February 1889,  F. Sorge called Engels' attention to a report 
carried by the newspaper Der arme Teufel, Nos. 9 and 10, 26 January and 2 
February 1889, entitled 'Korrespondenz des A.T. aus London, England', 
containing disparaging comments about Edward Aveling. 
375. A reference to Philipp Rappaport's article 'Über die Arbeiterbewegung in 
Amerika' published in the journal Die Neue Zeit, No. 2, 1889. In his letter 
of 10 February 1889 F. Sorge pointed to the poor quality of the article and 
said it would be better to publish excerpts from Edward Aveling and 
Eleanor Marx-Aveling, The Labour Movement in America (see note 89). 
376. The reference is to a series of lectures by Paul Lafargue and Gabriel Deville 
(Cours d'Economie Sociale) on Marx; these lectures were arranged by a 
circle at the Socialist Library of the French Workers' Party on Sundays as 
of 23 January 1884. Lafargue's series of lectures was called Le Matérialisme 
économique de Karl Marx. To his second lecture Paul Lafargue gave the 
following title: Le Milieu naturel. Théorie darwinienne. Gabriel Deville 
entitled his course of lectures L'Evolution du capital. There were five 
lectures in all: Genèse du capital, Formation du proletariat, Coopération et 
manufacture, Machinisme et grande industrie and Fin du capital. The 
lectures were published in the press and in separate editions in 1884. 
377. Engels refers to the defeat of the Prussians and Saxons at the hands of 
Napoleon at Jena (14 October 1806). 
378. Engels refers to the refusal of the Possibilists to take part in the 
International Hague Conference (see note 360). 
379. An allusion to the request of a group of Possibilists to the Municipal 
Council of Paris to grant them 50,000 francs for the organisation of an 
International Working Men's Congress. 
380. Jules Roques, the publisher of the newspaper Egalité, fired a group of print­
ing-shop workers who had been paid at rates fixed by the printers' union 
and had then replaced by non-unionised workmen. The indignant members 
of the editorial board, the Guesdists and the Blanquists, declared on 3 
March 1889 they would leave the editorial board (see also note 355). 
381. The materials of  P. Lafargue's letter of  5 March 1889 were indeed used in the 
report Aus Frankreich, Paris, 9 March, 1889 in the newspaper Der 
Sozialdemokrat, No. 12, 23 March, 1889, S.2-3. 
382. On 5 March 1889, Conrad Schmidt asked Engels to help him come to terms 
with Otto Meissner with the publication of his monograph Die 
Durch Schnittsprofitrate auf Grundlage des Marx'schen Wertgesetzes; this 
work appeared somewhat later at Stuttgart published by Dietz. Schmidt 
also wrote about his failure to obtain the position of senior lecturer at 
Leipzig University because of his socialist views. 
383. This refers to the setbacks of Marx and Engels in connection with the publi­
cation of their works in those years, specifically, The German Ideology 
(present edition, Vol. 5).

384. C. Schmidt's article 'Das Wertgesetz und Profitrate' was published in the 
Journal Die Neue Zeit, No. 10, 7 Jhrg. 1889. 
385. The International Socialist Conference was held in the Hague on 28 
February 1889. It was attended by representatives of the socialist movement 
of Germany, France, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland. The conference 
was convened at the suggestion of the Social Democratic faction in the 
German Reichstag with the aim of framing the conditions for the calling of 
an International Socialist Working Men's Congress in Paris. The Possibilists 
refused to attend the conference despite the invitation and did not recognise 
its decisions. The conference defined the powers of the forthcoming 
congress, its date and agenda. The International Working Men's Congress 
took place on 14 July 1889. 
386. A reference to the pamphlet The International Working Men's Congress of 
1889. A Reply to 'Justice', London 1889. Its original version was written by 
Eduard Bernstein at Engels' suggestion in reply to the editorial comment 
entitled The German 'Official' Social Democrats and the International 
Congress in Paris and carried by the newspaper Justice on 16 March 1889, 
No. 270. Having been edited by Engels, the pamphlet appeared in English 
in London, and then it was published by the German newspaper Der 
Sozialdemokrat and signed: E. Bernstein. 
387. An excerpt from this letter was first published in the journal La Pensée, No. 
61, 1955. About the first English publication of the letter, see note 77. 
388. In the latter half of the 1860s the government of the Second Empire exiled 
Henri Rochefort to New Caledonia for his virulent attacks against 
Napoleon III. In the 1880s, being an active supporter of General Boulanger 
and one of the editors of the newspaper L'Intransigeant, he placed it at the 
disposal of the Boulangists. 
389. April 1 - Bismarck's birthday. Engels refers to April's Fool Day (1 April). 
390. A hint at the ties with the Prussian police and the Bismarck government, 
incriminating for Johann Baptist von Schweitzer, President of the General 
Association of German Workers. 
391. The French government, alarmed at General Boulanger's popularity, decided 
to put him on trial on the pretext of his conspiring in a plot threatening the 
security of the republic. On 1 April 1889, Boulanger and some of his 
supporters fled abroad. On 8 April Boulanger was deprived of his parlia­
mentary immunity; and on 14 August 1889, the Supreme Court sentenced 
him, together with Dillon and Rochefort, who had fled in company with 
Boulanger, in absentia, to banishment. 
392. The reference is to Wilhelm Liebknecht's letter to Charles Bonnier of 26 
March 1889, about the need to change the date of an International Socialist 
Congress or, as an alternative, reaching agreement with the Possibilists. 
Wilhelm Liebknecht's letter to Eduard Bernstein has not been found. 
393. A reference to Wilhelm Liebknecht's letters to F. Engels of 20 and 28 March

dealing with the forthcoming International Congress, in particular, when it 
was called, and British representation in it. 
394. The resolution of the Hague Conference (see note 385) was published in the 
pamphlet The International Working Men's Congress of  1889.  A Reply to 
'Justice', (see note 386). 
395. Engels means the Trade Union Committee of Protest Against the 
Parliamentary Committee's Actions With Regard To the Paris International 
Working Men's Congre«. The Parliamentary Committee (see note 269) 
refused to take part on the pretext of British workers having a shorter work­
ing day and higher wages than the workers of other European countries and 
thus not needing any protection of their interests. The newly established 
Protest Committee of representatives of many trade unions organised 
protest meetings and entered into correspondence with socialist parties 
abroad concerning the preparation of the Congress. 
396. Wilhelm Liebknecht's letters of this period are not available. However, 
Engels' letter to P. Lafargue of 10 April 1889 suggests that Liebknecht must 
have written to Bernstein. 
397. The whereabouts of this letter of Engels is not known but it is apparent 
from A. Bebel's letter to Engels of 14 April 1889 that he had received the 
Engels letter. 
398. The Workers' Party of Belgium had its congress at Jolimont on 22 April 
1889 (see note 405). 
399. The newspaper Der Sozialist, the organ of the Socialist Labor Party of 
North America, carried the article 'Zum Internationalen Kongres in Paris' 
in its issue of 16 March 1889. 
400. In the book series Volks-Bibliothek, with Wilhelm Liebknecht as one of the 
editors, his son-in-law, Bruno Geiser, published Maximilian Schlesinger^ 
pamphlet Die soziale Frage, Breslau 1889. In it Schlesinger attempted to 
'make a critical revision' of Marxian ideas. Liebknecht did not come 
forward with an open protest against this work. Subsequently Liebknecht 
dissociated himself from the book, a fact that made Engels indignant. 
401. Living in London, E. Bernstein made regular visits to the Fabian Society 
meetings at which problems of socialism were being discussed - The Fabian 
Society, see note 176. 
402. The academic socialists (die Kathedersozialisten - literally 'lectern social­
ists') were representatives of a trend in German political economy in the 
latter third of the 19th century, a response to the growing working-class 
movement and the propagation of the ideas of socialism. They used univer­
sity lecterns {Katheder) to preach bourgeois reformism under the flag of 
socialism and claimed that the state, the German Reich in particular, was 
above class, and that with its help the working class would be able to 
improve its position through social reforms. 
403. Le Père Duchesne was a newspaper published at the time of the French

Notes 581 
Revolution by the Jacobins (1790-94), as the mouthpiece of genuinely 
popular interests. The paper got its name from the French folk hero, le père 
Duchêne, allegedly a real person, who had been defending the oppressed 
and destitute. The same name was given to newspapers during the revolu­
tions of 1848-49 and 1871. By calling Paul Lafargue 'le père Duchêne' 
('Father Duchêne), Engels questioned Lafargue's confidence that he could 
speak out on behalf of all the French Socialists. 
404. Engels refers to Guesdists' blunders that led to the closure of the newspa­
pers Egalité and Socialiste. By 'three Egalités', Engels means a socialist 
weekly founded by Jules Guesde in 1877 and published on and off in five 
series until 1883. In 1886 an attempt was made to resume its publication; but 
only one issue came out, and the publication of the second Egalité was 
discontinued. By a 'third Egalité', Engels refers to a newspaper appearing in 
1889 (see note 355). About Socialiste, see note 234. 
405. This refers to a congress of the Workers' Party of Belgium on 22 April 1889 
at Jolimont, which decided to send delegates both to the International 
Working Men's Congress convened by Marxists in Paris and to the congress 
convened by the Possibilists, contrary to the opinion of the Ghent delega­
tion that opposed the convocation. 
406. The whereabouts of this letter is unknown. 
407. Apparently Engels means August Bebel's letter of 28 April 1889, about the 
preparation of the International Socialist Working Men's Congress in Paris 
and the stand of the German and Dutch Social Democrats with respect to 
the congress contemplated by the Possibilists. 
408. The reference is to the appeal of the German Social Democrats Ignaz Auer 
and Max Schippel in the German Party press for participation in the 
Possibilist-sponsored congress. The newspaper Berliner Volks-Tribüne, 
where Schippel was one of the editors, carried the article 'Zum Pariser 
Arbeiterkongres' in its issue of 27 April 1889. The Berliner Volksblatt came 
forward with the article 'Der internationale Arbeiter-kongres', No. 94, 21 
April 1889, ppl-2. Speaking of Charles Bonnier's reply to these articles, 
Engels has in mind his article 'In Sachen des internationalen 
Arbeiterkongresses' published by the newspaper Berliner Volksblatt, No. 
97, 26 April 1889 in its feature Politische Übersicht. 
409. Under the conditions of the Anti-Socialist Law (see note 52), the Social 
Democratic faction in the Reichstag exercised the functions of the party's 
Executive Board. On 18 May 1889, it issued an appeal to Germany's work­
men and urged them to elect their representatives to the International 
Socialist Workingmen's Congress in Paris, convened by the Marxists. This 
appeal was published in the newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat, No. 21, 25 May 
1889,  p2, {Die sozialdemokratische Fraktion des deutschen Reichstages). 
410. The court prosecution of most of the defendants was discontinued due to 
numerous protests from the workers, and the court proceedings adjourned.

582 Notes 
The Elberfeld trial took place in November-December 1889 (see note 569). 
411.Wyden (Switzerland) was the venue of the first illegal congress of the 
German Social Democrats after the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law 
(see note 52). This congress, held on 20-23 August 1880, denounced the 
activities of the anarchist group that denied any use of legal methods of 
struggle and staked all on individual terror. The anarchists embarked on an 
open struggle against the party leadership. The congress expelled the anar­
chist leaders Johann Most and Wilhelm Hasselmann from the party ranks. 
The congress decided in a unanimous voice to amend the second clause of 
the party's Programme adopted at Gotha in 1875 - a clause stipulating that 
the party was to prosecute its aims 'by all legal means' - and strike out the 
word 'legal'. The newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat was endorsed as the 
party's official organ. About the St Gallen Congress, see note 174. 
412. At the Hague Conference (see note 385) some of the delegates, Ferdinand 
Nieuwenhuis among them, displayed a conciliatory attitude towards the 
Possibilists. 
413. A reference to the Organising Committee for the Convocation of an 
International Working Men's Congress. Set up in Paris on the eve of 1889, 
it included representatives of the Syndicates Federation (Boulé, Besset, 
Féline, Monceau, Roussel), of a group of socialists - members of the Paris 
Municipal Council (Longuet, Vaillant, etc.) and of a socialist group from the 
Chamber of Deputies (Ferroul, Planteau). Paul Lafargue and Besset became 
its secretaries. 
414. The circular was written with P. Lafargue's active participation so as to 
inform the working-class and socialist organisations of all countries about 
the decision of the Hague Socialist Conference (February 1889) (see note 
385) and about the International Working Men's Congress due on 6 May 
1889.  Lafargue sent the text of the circular to Engels who approved it and 
translated it into German. Engels also saw about it being published in 
English. In German the circular was published, in the Engels translation, by 
the newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat on 11 May and, in Wilhelm 
Liebknecht's translation, by the newspaper Berliner Volksblatt on 10 May; 
in English, the text of the circular came cut in the form of a leaflet, published 
by the newspapers Labour Elector on 18 May and by Reynold's Newspaper 
on 19 May under the heading 'International Workmen's Congress', as well 
as by The Commonweal on 25 May. 
415. Engels cites an excerpt from August Bebel's letter of 30 April 1889. 
416. Engels had received a letter from the workmen of Lyon, but, since the signa­
tures and the address were illegible, he asked Lafargue to transcribe them. 
417. The International Working Men's Congress must have used the weekly 
Socialiste as its official organ. This newspaper came out from 20 April to 14 
July 1889 as an organ of the Workers' Party. It carried reports relating to the 
preparation of the Congress.

Notes 583 
418. Engels is referring to the expulsion of two Leftwing members (one of whom 
was Trier) of the Executive Committee of the Danish Socialist Party, 
because they were opposed to the Socialist Party forming a bloc with 
Venstre, the Danish liberals, who expressed the interests of major landed 
proprietors and factory owners. 
419. The reference is to the International Trade Union Congress in London (see 
note 320). 
420. On 27 April 1889 the newspaper Le Proletariat published an article entitled 
'Au congrès belge' which subscribed to the Possibilist point of view 
concerning the preparation of the International socialist Workingmen's 
Congress. 
421. 'A Letter to the Editors' of the newspaper Labour Elector, Vol. I, No. 18, 
published on 4 May 1689 and signed by Bonnier, was written by Engels and 
sent in at his suggestion. Bonnier was staying in London at the time and 
taking an active part in the preparation for the International Working Men's 
Congress. 
422. A reference to an appeal by the Paris Chamber of Labour, urging participa­
tion in the Possibilist Congress due in the latter half of July 1889. The 
authors of this appeal said they were speaking on behalf of 78 trade unions 
of France that had allegedly agreed to take part. Bonnier's letter of 4 May 
1889 to the editorial board of the newspaper Labour Elector said the authors 
of the appeal had abrogated the right to speak on behalf of the entire work­
ing class of France. Engels, the real author of the letter, urged the French 
socialists not to confine themselves to declarative statements but prove their 
case by deed and convince the masses by irrefutable facts. 
423. A paraphrase of 'Vous l'avez voulu, George Dandin, vous l'avez voulu' 
from Molière's George Dandin. 
424. In March 1889 a new external Russian loan was issued to a sum of 175 
million gold roubles for the conversion of the older 5 per cent bonds. 
425. On 3 May 1889, the newspaper The Star, No. 400, published an article enti­
tled The Paris International Congress. 
426. The reference is to the issues of the newspaper The Star of 4 and 7 May 
1889.  On 7 May the newspaper carried the article 'The Workingmen's Party 
- A Chat with Some Practical Socialists at the Hôtel de Ville', which 
contained the attacks on Edouard Vaillant mentioned in the text of the 
letter. 
427. Several Possibilist organisations, dissatisfied with the behaviour of their 
leaders during the election to the chamber of Deputies on 27 January 1889, 
and in the course of the preparation for the International Working Men's 
Congress, levelled strong criticism at them. In its turn, the leadership of the 
Possibilist Party on 16 April expelled the group of the 14th arrondissement 
of Paris from its ranks; late in April 1889 the key organisations of the 13th 
arrondissement left the Federation of the Possibilists. For more detail, see

the pamphlet The International Working Men's Congress of 1889, II, A 
Reply to the 'Manifesto of the Social Democratic Federation' (see note 444). 
428. After General Boulanger's flight abroad (see note 391J, which actually 
amounted to his departure from the political arena of France, Jules Ferry, 
one of the leaders of the moderate bourgeois republicans, developed vigor­
ous political activity with the aim of forming a government of his own. On 
6 May 1889, he made a speech at Saint-Dié in defence of the republic. Engels 
here uses an expression from one of P. Lafargue's letters unknown to us. 
429. The text of this letter was written on the last page of Laura Lafargue's letter 
to Engels of 12 May 1889. L. Lafargue said in her letter she had been unable 
yet to persuade Vaillant and others to send letters to the newspaper The 
Star; she expressed her doubts about the expedience of such a mode of 
procedure. Engels replied on 14 May (see the next letter). 
430. On 14 May 1889, the newspaper The Star, in the section The People's Post 
Box carried An Invitation, signed by P. Lafargue, and containing a précis of 
the circular in connection with the convocation of an International Working 
Men's Congress in Paris (see note 414). 
431. The whereabouts of this letter of Engels is not known. 
432. The circular about the convocation of an International Working Men's 
Congress, written by P. Lafargue and J. Guesde, was sent by the authors to 
Engels on 14 May, 1889. In June 1889 it was printed in the form of a leaflet 
in French in Paris and in English in London, and also published in German 
by the newspapers Der Sozialdemokrat on 1 June and Berliner Volksblatt 
on 2 June. The newspaper The Star had also printed it on 14 May 1889 in 
the Feature The People's Post Box (in English); the circular likewise 
appeared in the weekly Commonweal on 8 June and also as an appendix to 
the pamphlet The International Working Men's Congress of 1889, II, A 
Reply to the 'Manifesto of the Social Democratic Federation' (see note 444). 
433. The reference is to Bonnier's letter published by The Star on 15 May 1889, 
under the heading The Paris Congress; it exposed the collusion of the 
Possibilists with the reactionary wing in the Paris Municipal Council. 
434. Engels is referring to E. Aveling's play Dregs, staged by the Vaudeville 
Theatre on 16 May 1889. 
435. The German coal miners' strike in the Ruhr was a major event in the 
German working-class movement of the late 19th century. It began on 3 
May 1889 in the Essen and on 4 May in the Helsenkirch coal mining 
districts; then it spread to the entire Dortmund area. At its height the strike 
action involved as many as eighty thousand miners. The main demands 
were: higher wages, an eight-hour working day and recognition of the 
worker committees. Frightened by the scope of the strike action, govern­
ment bodies had the entrepreneurs make a promise to fulfil some of the 
miners' demands. As a result, some of the miners resumed their work in mid 
May. However, the mine-owners broke their promises, and a meeting of

Notes 585 
coal miners' delegates on 24 May decided to continue the strike action. The 
threat of reprisals and the new promises made by mine-owners resulted in 
the termination of the strike in the beginning of June. 
436. Engels refers to the piece Her Father with the subtitle Time of  Trial,  writ­
ten by Edward Rose and I. Douglas. 
437. An allusion to two notes by Alec Rubie, published by The Sun, No. 5, Vol. 
1,19 May 1889 in the feature Political Men and Matters. Both dealt with the 
convocation of an International Working Men's Congress in Paris. 
438. The reference is to Henry Hyndman's note 'Much Ado About Nothing' 
published anonymously by the newspaper Justice, No. 279, Vol. VI, on 18 
May 1889, in the feature Critical Chronicle. While paying tribute to Paul 
Lafargue's literary talent, eloquence and charisma, the author attacked the 
French and German socialists for their ostensibly deliberate action in not 
inviting the Possibilists to the Hague Conference. 
439. In reference to a brief note, bearing no title, carried by the newspaper 
Prolétariat, No. 268,18 May 1889, pi, col. 5, which opened with the follow­
ing words: 'Les irlando-guesdo-blanquistes assurent dans leur circulaire a 
l'étranger que le Danemark leur a donné son adhésion'. 
440. In Regent Street on the evening of 18 May 1889 Rochefort met Pilotell, a 
well-known caricaturist of the Commune days, who boxed his ears. 
Rochefort drew his revolver, but was disarmed. The matter ended in the 
English Courts. 
441. Henry Hyndman called the Hague Conference (see note 385) a 'caucus' in 
his editorial note 'Much Ado About Nothing' (see note 438). 
442. In mid March 1889 Wilhelm Liebknecht spent about two weeks in 
Switzerland as a representative of German Social Democracy; on 17 March 
1889,  he attended the unveiling of a monument to Johann Becker at the St 
Georges cemetery near Geneva. 
443. The appeal was published by Labour Elector on 18 May 1889; yet the paper 
had nothing to say about William Parnell and about copies of this appeal 
which he allegedly had. 
444. According to The Manifesto of the Social Democratic Federation, the 
International Congress of Trade Unions in London (see note 320) voted 
unanimously to authorise the Possibilists to convene an International 
Workingmen's Congress in Paris. The manifesto also claimed that Gabriel 
Farjat, described as a representative of the 'French soidisant Marxists, or 
Guesdists', voted for this resolution. E. Bernstein, in his pamphlet The 
International Working Men's Congress of 1889, II, A Reply to the Manifesto 
of the Social Democratic Federation rebutted these fabrications by proving 
that as a representative of the French trade unions, not Socialists, Farjat 
could not vote for this resolution. Subsequently one of the publications 
released by the Organising Committee for the Convocation of an 
International Working Men's Congress in Paris had a special postscript with 

=====第597页=====
586 Notes 
Farjat's statement to the effect that, far from voting for the resolution 
entrusting the convocation of an International Congress to the Possibilists, 
he could not do it for the simple reason that the resolution was never put to 
the vote. 
445. Pertaining to the collection of signatures to the circular for the convocation 
of an International Working Men's Congress in Paris. Representatives of the 
Danish Social Democratic Party, who had not attended the Hague 
Conference (see note 385) but had announced in advance that they agreed 
with all of its decisions, unexpectedly refused to send delegates to both 
congresses. Concerning the two trends in the Danish socialist movement, 
see note 418. 
446. P. Lafargue asked Engels to write to Nikolai Danielson (see Lafargue P., F. 
Engels, 14 May 1889, Correspondence, Vol. 2, Moscow 1960) and request 
him to get in touch with the publishers of the Northern Review. In 1889, in 
its issue No. 4, this journal published the Russian translation of Lafargue's 
article 'The Machine as a Factor of Progress' (see note 468), the final chap­
ter of his major work Das Proletariat der Handarbeit und Kopfarbeit 
published by Die Neue Zeit, No. 3, 1888. 
447. The reference is to the difficulties in getting the signatures of Russian 
Socialists to the circular about the convocation of the Paris Congress (see 
note 432). Lafargue had approached Pyotr Lavrov, with whom he was 
acquainted, on the matter. Lavrov declined at first by saying that, not being 
a representative of any particular revolutionary organisation in Russia, he 
was not entitled to sign. Subsequently he was authorised to do this. 
However, by that time Sergei Stepniak-Kravchinsky, Vera Zasulich, Pavel 
Axelrod and Georgy Plekhanov had given their consent. 
448. The National Labour Electoral Association - a trade union organisation that 
succeeded, in 1887, to the Labour Electoral Committee; its aim was to have 
workmen being elected to Parliament and municipal councils. 
449. The expression 'music of the future' gained popularity with the publication, 
in 1861, of Richard Wagner's letter to Frédéric Villot, the custodian of 
French museums, under the title: 'Zukunftsmusik. An einen französischen 
Freund' ('Music of the Future. To a French Friend'). 
450. A reference to the pamphlet The International Working Men's Congress of 
1889, II, A Reply to the 'Manifesto of the Social Democratic Federation', 
London 1889. Its original version was written by Eduard Bernstein on Engels' 
initiative in connection with the campaign waged by the leadership of the 
Social Democratic Federation (see note 62) in support of a Congress convened 
by the Possibilists in Paris, with the aim of preventing the success of an 
International Socialist Workingmen's Congress which the Marxists were to 
hold. This work was edited by Engels and published as a pamphlet in English. 
451. The reference is to the elected council of the London County in charge of 
taxes,  local budget, etc. All persons entitled to take part in parliamentary

elections were eligible to elect county councillors as well as women 30 years 
of age and older. This reform of local government was implemented in 
August 1888. 
452. The section of the Social Democratic Federation in Battersea; affiliated with 
the Trade Union Protest Committee (see note 395). 
453. The Hague Congress (2-7 September 1872) of the International was the 
most representative forum of the International Working Men's Association; 
taking part were 65 delegates from 15 countries. The Congress reviewed the 
results of the struggle against the Bakunin anarchists within the 
International and outlined a programme of action under new conditions 
obtaining after the Paris Commune. The main decision of the Congress was 
the endorsement of Resolution IX of the London Conference of 1871 on 
the political action of the working class, summed up as Article 7a of the 
General Rules of the International. The Congress also adopted a number of 
resolutions designed to strengthen the organisational structure of the 
Workingmen's Association. The anarchist leaders, Mikhail Bakunin and 
James Guillaume, were expelled from the International Working Men's 
Association. After the Congress, Bakunin and his supporters openly 
opposed its resolutions, a move that resulted in an actual split of the 
International. 
454. A reference to the congress of the Bakuninist Jura Federation in Sonvillier 
on 12 November  1871,  which adopted the Circulaire à toutes les fédérations 
de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs. 
The Sonvillier circular countered the decisions of the London Conference 
of the International with anarchist dogmas on political indifferentism and 
complete autonomy of sections; it also calumniated the General Council of 
the International. The Bakuninists suggested that all federations should 
demand an immediate congress to revise the General Rules of the 
International and to condemn the General Council's actions. About the 
Manifesto of the Social Democratic Federation, see note 444. 
455. Engels alludes to the split within the International Working Men's 
Association following the Hague Congress of the First International (see 
note 453). In 1873 the anarchists convened their congress in Geneva which 
set the stage for an international association of anarchists - an organisation 
which they would describe as a genuine International Working Men's 
Association. 
456. Pertaining to C. Schmidt's letter to F. Engels of 15 April 1889. Seeking a 
publisher for his work Die Durchschnittsprofitrate auf Grundlage des 
Marx'sehen Werthgesetzes; C. Schmidt asked to send him  F. Lassalle's book 
Der Criminal-Prozeß wider mich wegen Verleitung zum Cassetten-
Diebstahl oder: Die Anklage der moralischen Mitschuld, Köln, 1848. 
Schmidt thanked Engels who had offered him to give letters of recommen­
dation to A. Bebel and W. Liebknecht.

457. Engels must have meant representatives of the bourgeois opposition of the 
latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, particularly, the 
Russian liberal gentry who were playing a significant part in the zemstvos. 
These liberals exhibited much moderation, lack of will and loyalty toward 
the tsarist autocracy, and sought to come to terms with tsarism through 
petty reforms. Zemstvos were bodies of restricted local self-government 
introduced in Russia in 1864. 
458. On 16 June 1889, August Bebel notified Engels about the receipt of his 
letter. The whereabouts of the Engels letter is unknown. 
459. In his article 'The International Workers' Congress and the Marxist Clique', 
Henry Hyndman claimed that the signatures of W. Parnell and S.M. 
Stepniak were appended without their consent. 
460. The letter of Stepniak (S.M. Kravchinsky) was published in the newspaper 
Justice, No. 284, on 22 June 1889. 
461. A reference to an article by Arthur Field, an English journalist, in the Kent 
Times and Tribune on the occasion of the International Socialist Congress 
(see P. Lafargue's letter to F. Engels of 2 June 1889). 
462. Apparently, pertaining to P. Lafargue's letter to F. Engels of 18 June, 1889, 
in a reply to F. Engels' letter of 15 June. 
463. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was a federation of labour unions 
of the United States and Canada, founded in December 1886. The AFL 
comprised skilled workers by and large, unionised in keeping with the shop 
principle. In the initial stage of its activity, the AFL had a positive role to 
play in rallying American workingmen and in the struggle for a law on an 
eight-hour workday. 
464. P. Lafargue asked Engels how true it was that Jean Lavy, a Possibilist dele­
gate elected by school teachers to the London Congress of Trade Unions in 
November 1888, had not been admitted on account of his being a manual 
worker. 
465. In September 1889 an election to the chamber of Deputies was to be held in 
France. P. Lafargue suggested nominating his candidacy in the 5th 
arrondissement of Paris and at Avignon; however, a tentative enquiry 
showed he would be blackballed. Therefore Lafargue tried to nominate his 
candidature in the provinces: in Marseilles, Cette and elsewhere, but he 
suffered a defeat by polling only 6.26 per cent of the votes. 
466. W. Parnell's letter was published in the Labour Elector, Vol. 1, No. 25, on 22 
June 1889 (about the National Labour Electoral Association, see note 448). 
467. The whereabouts of these letters of Engels is not known. 
468. Nikolai Danielson must have referred to articles by P. Lafargue and K. 
Kautsky published in 1889 in the Russian journal Northern Review. 
469. On 27 March (8 April) 1889, Nikolai Danielson informed Engels that 
Hermann Lopatin, gravely ill a few months before, had made a recovery and 
was in good health at the moment.

470. The whereabouts of the letter is not known. 
471. Writing to F. Engels on 2 July 1889, P. Laf argue told him he met at Epernay, 
in the champagne-producing district, a large number of revolutionary 
socialist winegrowers, small growers completely ruined by the big cham­
pagne manufactures. 
472 In these letters P. Martignetti told F. Engels about the outcome of the court 
trial and about the persecutions he had been subjected to from 1885 for the 
translation and circulation of F. Engels' works in Italy. Martignetti said he 
would leave for Buenos Aires if the sentence was endorsed (see note 230). 
473. The International (Socialist) Working Men's Congress was in session in Paris 
on 14-20 July 1889, on the centennial of the storming of the Bastille. In fact, 
it became a constituent Congress of the Second International. Taking part 
were 393 delegates, representing the worker and socialist parties of 20 coun­
tries of Europe and America. 
The Congress heard the reports of representatives of the socialist parties 
on the situation in the labour movement in their countries; it outlined the 
principles of international labour legislation in respective countries by 
supporting demands for a legislative enactment of an  8-hour  working day, 
prohibition of child labour and steps toward the protection of the work of 
women and adolescents. The Congress stressed the need of political organ­
isation of the proletariat and of a struggle for implementation of democra­
tic demands of the working class; it spoke out for a disbandment of regular 
armies and their replacement by armed detachments of the people. It 
resolved to hold, on 1 May 1890, demonstrations and meetings in support 
of an  8-hour  working day and labour legislation. 
474. The International Conference of Miners was held on 18-19 July 1889; it was 
attended by delegates to both international working men's congresses 
which were in session at the time in Paris (see note 473). The Conference 
discussed reports on the situation of miners' trade unions and decided to set 
up an international association of miners' unions, which was formed in 
1890. 
475. Engels must have been referring to F. Schlüter 's letter of  1 July 1889 about 
the labour and trade union movement in North America and about his futile 
attempts to get a job in American labour newspapers. 
476. At that time many German newspapers carried reports about a conversation 
allegedly held by a correspondent of the London newspaper Evening News 
and Post with Lev Hartman, who said he had been staying for six months 
in Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland under an assumed name with 
the aim of organising there an 'overthrow party' and that this party was 
getting ready for big events. At Engels' request, Sorge turned to Hartman 
for explanations; the latter refuted such inventions - he said he had not left 
the United States at the time. Sorge informed Engels about this in his letter 
of 7 August.

590 Notes 
477. In this letter Sorge notified Engels about the sending of the newspaper 
Nationalist, as well as about attempts of Mr and Mrs Wischnewetzky to 
establish contacts with him. 
478. A reference to a campaign by the Possibilists in France, and their support­
ers from the Social Democratic Federation (see note 62), to discredit the 
International Working Men's Congress held by the Socialists (see note 473). 
Only a few foreign delegates attended the Possibilists Congress held in 
Paris at the same time as the International Working Men's Congress; the 
representation of most of its delegates was of a purely fictitious nature. 
479. On 18 March 1876, Ferdinand Lingenau, a German socialist who had 
emigrated to the United States, bequeathed about $7,000 to the Socialist 
Workers' Party of Germany, naming August Bebel, Johann Philipp Becker, 
Wilhelm Bracke, August Geib, Wilhelm Liebknecht and Karl Marx as 
executors. Upon Lingenau's death in the United States on 4 August 1877, 
his executors tried to act on his will and have the above sum placed at the 
party's disposal. Bismarck succeeded in preventing this. 
480. Gustave Brocher appealed to Engels and asked for material assistance for V. 
Smirnov. 
481. The reference is to two letters from Sorge in which he confirmed the receipt 
of the newspapers sent to him by Engels. They reported on a denial, sent to 
Schlüter, of the assertion of the newspaper New-Yorker Volkszeitung about 
the alleged presence of Engels at the Paris Congress, as well as a denial of 
the report carried by The Evening News and Post on Lev Hartman's trip to 
Europe (see note 476). 
482. The Liberal-Unionists were a J. Chamberlain-led group which in July 1886 
broke away from the Liberal Party, because of differences over the draft of 
Home Rule legislation (April 1886) tabled by the Liberal government for 
Ireland which provided for a restoration of the autonomous bicameral 
parliament, with the British government continuing its control over the 
Irish economy. The Liberal-Unionists came out for the preservation of the 
Anglo-Irish union which had been in existence from 1801. They made 
common cause with the Conservative Party and officially joined it several 
years later. 
483. By 'Tory-Socialists' Engels meant the left wing of the Conservative Party; 
this faction comprised mainly representatives of the big industrial bour­
geoisie and intellectuals (men-of-letters, lawyers, etc). 
484. In August 1889 the Labour Elector published material on the forthcoming 
Trades Union Congress at Dundee; its agenda included issues of labour 
legislation, specifically, a law on an  8-hour  working day. 
485. Engels referred to events of the 1880s, in particular the arbitrary actions of 
the Turkish authorities with regard to the Armenian population. A special 
government commission (Commission of Inquiry) which was dispatched 
there suggested that victims of the reprisals should go to Constantinople

(Istanbul) to have the conflict settled. However, the Turkish courts failed to 
settle the conflict. In July 1889 the population of several rural communities 
in Crete rose in rebellion against the Turkish authorities. This revolt esca­
lated into bloody clashes between the Muslim and Christian populations of 
the island. The Russian government sent a message to Turkey in which it 
demanded action on her commitments with respect to the ethnic groups and 
nationalities inhabiting that country To restore order, the Turkish govern­
ment sent Shakir Pasha, a former Turkish ambassador to Russia, as a new 
ruler of Crete. The bloodshed between the Muslim and Christian commu­
nities on the island continued till December 1889. About the Anglo-
Prussian union, see note 349. 
486. An allusion to Wilhelm Liebknecht's trip to the United States for agitation 
purposes, which he undertook with Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward 
Aveling in September-December 1886 (see note 3). 
487. A fragment of this letter was first published in English in the collection 
Marx K, Engels F. On Britain, Foreign Languages Publishing House, 
Moscow, 1953, pp520-21. An excerpt from this letter was first published by 
the newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat on 31 August 1889, as a leading article 
entitled "Der Streik der 'Unqualifizierten'". 
488. A reference to P. Fischer's letters to F. Engels of 21 and 31 August in which 
he asked Engels* permission to translate into German - for the weekly 
Berliner Volk-Tribune - the article 'Book of Revelation' (see present 
edition, Vol. 26) which Engels had written for the journal  Progress;  Fischer 
also asked to mention the collection in Mannheimer Abendzeitung which 
had published Marx's article 'Comments on the Latest Prussian Censorship 
Instruction' (see present edition, Vol. 1). 
489. The strike of the London dockers from 12 August to 14 September 1889 
was a major event in the chronicle of the British labour movement of the 
late 19th century. It involved thirty thousand dockers and over thirty thou­
sand - largely unskilled - workers of other trades not affiliated with the 
trade unions. Displaying tenacity and organisation, the strikers succeeded in 
their demands for higher wages and better working conditions. The strike 
contributed to stronger proletarian solidarity (with about £50,000 being 
donated to the strike fund) and promoted working-class solidarity. It gave 
rise to the dockers' union and other trade union organisations uniting a 
large number of general and unskilled workmen; the 'new trade unions' 
emerged as a result. The text of the excerpts from this letter coincides with 
some passages from a series of articles by E. Bernstein in the newspaper Der 
Sozialdemokrat (No. 35, 31 August, No. 36, 7 September and No. 37, 14 
September 1889) on the London dockers' strike; these articles were written 
on F. Engels' advice. 
490. As a result of their strike action Quly 1889), the working women of 
London's match-making factories won their demands for higher wages.

592 Notes 
491. On 8 February 1886, supporters of the protectionist tariffs held a rally in 
Trafalgar Square. Taking part were also trade union activists of pro-
Conservative leanings (S. Peters, T.M. Kelley, W. Kenny and T. Lemon, 
who were expelled at the Trades Union Congress at Manchester in 1882). 
The Social Democratic Federation (see note 62) organised a protest meeting 
and a demonstration of unemployed against the agitation of the 
Conservatives for protectionist tariffs. The demonstration was joined by 
lumpen-proletarian elements who started sacking and looting the surround­
ing shops. Subsequently the police arrested the federation leaders Henry 
Hyndman, John Burns, Henry Champion and John Williams on charges of 
inciting riot in their speeches. The court acquitted all the men on 10 April. 
492. Engels cites words from the German folk song Prinz Eugen, der adle Ritter. 
493. An excerpt from this letter was first published in French by the journal La 
Pensée, No. 61, 1955. In English the text of this letter was first published in 
full by Labour Monthly, London, 1955, No. 8. 
494. Engels refers to the group of Blanquists led by E. Roche and E. Granget that 
gave open support to General Boulanger. 
495. Engels cites the name of  V. Hugo's novel Les misérables. 
496. The Russian Empress Maria Fyodorovna (wife of emperor Alexander III 
and mother of the last Russian tsar Nicholas II) was a daughter of the 
Danish King Christian IX. Her brother Waldemar was married to Louis 
Philippe's granddaughter, Maria, the Princess of Orléans. 
497. A reference to the fourth German-language edition of Volume I of Capital 
(Das Kapital. Kritik der politischen Oekonomie. Von Karl Marx. Erster 
Band. Buch I: Der Produktionsprocess des Kapitals. Vierte durchgesehene 
Auflage. Herausgegeben von Friedrich Engels. Hamburg, Verlag von Otto 
Meissner. Druck von Hesse & Becker in Leipzig, 1890), prepared for the 
press by F. Engels. The book came out late in 1890. In a preface to this 
edition and also in his letter to Nikolai Danielson of 5 December 1889, 
Engels pointed to the amendments made in the text of the third edition (two 
or three new additions from the French edition, a few notes of his own -
one on bimetallism in particular; the quotations were collated with the 
English edition). 
498. Engels alludes to his vacation at Eastbourne from 8 August to 6 September 
1889. 
499. Another regular Trades Union Congress took place in Dundee (Scotland) at 
the beginning of September 1889. Both the preparatory stage and the very 
course of the Congress mirrored the struggle between the old Conservative 
leadership with Henry Broadhurst at the head (see note 269) and represen­
tatives of the new trade unions with broad masses of general and unskilled 
workers as members. One of the main issues discussed at the Congress 
related to a legislative enactment of an eight-hour working day. However, 
the absence of some of the leaders or the new trade unions, because of the 

=====第604页=====
Notes 593 
dockers' strike in London (see note 489), had a negative effect on the over­
all results. The demand for a law on an  8-hour  working day was turned 
down by 88 votes against 63. Broadhurst and the old leadership managed to 
retain their position. Yet ultimately Engels' prediction concerning a victory 
of the protagonists of the law proved correct: at its next session in Liverpool 
in September 1890, the Trades Union Congress adopted a resolution in 
favour of an enactment of an eight-hour working day. 
500. Pertaining to the electoral reforms of 1867 and 1884 in England. According 
to the reform of 1867, in towns the right to vote was granted to house 
owners and house leaseholders, as well as to tenants with a residence record 
of not less than a year and paying the rent of not less than £10. In counties 
the property qualification was reduced to £12 rent per annum, which 
enabled some of the industrial workers to obtain voting rights. The electoral 
reform of 1884 extended the provisions of the 1867 reform to rural districts. 
Consequently, part of the rural population became eligible. Both reforms 
notwithstanding, the number of voters was only 13 per cent of the entire 
population. Suffrage was denied to non property owners and women. 
501. The reference is to the changes within the Executive of the Socialist Labor 
Party of North America (note 3) that had occurred as of September 1889; 
these changes reflected the factional struggle in the party ranks. National 
Secretary W. Rosenberg and several members of the Executive were 
removed from the leadership. A sequel to the ensuing split was the holding 
of two separate conventions in Chicago. The convention of 12 October 
1889,  held by a group of party members who had rallied around the news­
paper New Yorker Volkszeitung, adopted a new party programme that 
reflected the views of its progressive wing. 
502. George J. Harney's article 'The Revolt of the East End' was published by 
the newspaper Newcastle Weekly Chronicle on 26 September 1889. Excerpts 
from this article were published by the newspaper Labour Elector, Vol. II, 
No. 38, on 28 September 1889,  p203,  in an editorial note 'A Voice from the 
Past'. 
503. Engels compares the Fabians (see note 176) to the 'Nationalists', represen­
tatives of a social movement that emerged in the United States late in the 
1880s. 'Nationalist clubs' sprung up with the appearance of Edward 
Bellamy's Utopia Looking Backward. The first such club was set up in 
Boston in 1881; in 1891, the total number exceeded 160. Representatives of 
the urban middle class constituted the bulk of the membership in these 
propagandistic clubs. The 'Nationalists' set the aim of ridding society of the 
worst evils of capitalism through nationalisation of production and distrib­
ution; they advocated a peaceful development of capitalism into socialism. 
The nationalist movement had some impact on the further course of social­
ist thought in the United states.

505. During the International Socialist Working Men's Congress in Paris (see 
note 473) 206 French delegates held two separate conferences; this led to the 
formation of the National Council of the French Workers' Party (see note 
33). Elected to the Council were Camescasse, Crépin, Dereure, Deville, 
Guesde, Lafargue and Laine for the practical guidance of the party. The next 
party congress, convened by the National Council in Lille on 11-12 
October 1890, finalised the set-up and the functions of the Council. The 
report on the setting up of the National Council, referred to by Engels, was 
published in the Labour Elector, No. 38, on 28 September 1889, under the 
headline 'Foreign Notes: France', pi98. 
506. The whereabouts of this letter is unknown. It must have been written on 24 
September 1889. On 27 September A. Bebel wrote the following in reply: 
'At the moment the proposal is put to the vote whether we should give 
money for the French election or not. It is also my opinion that the 'money 
should certainly be assigned for Guesde's election if the proposal is 
endorsed. I have clearly stated that'. It was said in P. Lafargue's letter to F. 
Engels of 7 October 1889, that A. Bebel, on a commission from the party 
leadership, had sent 500 francs for Guesde, and 610 francs for Lafargue. 
507. During the International Socialist Working Men's Congress in July 1889 the 
German delegates passed 1000 francs to the French delegates as relief for the 
families of disaster victims at one of the mines of Saint-Etienne. 
508. This article by Charles Jaclard - which he wrote for his weekly feature in 
the newspaper La Voix and which he entitled 'Lundis socialistes' - was 
published on 30 September 1889. 
509. A reference to the forthcoming second round of the general and parliamen­
tary election of 1889. The candidates mentioned by Engels gained a major­
ity of votes in the first round and thus were eligible to run in the second. 
510. Refers to the unification at Gotha in 1875 of the Social Democratic 
Workers' Party set up in 1869 (the Eisenach party) and of the Lassallean 
General Association of German Workers founded in 1863. The party 
programme, adopted by the Gotha congress, incorporated as its essential 
part some of the ideas of the Lassallean agitation concept, a fact that elicited 
sharp criticism from Marx and Engels. 
511. The battle of Austerlitz (Moravia) on 2 December 1805, between the Russo-
Austrian and French armies, was won by Napoleon I. 
512. W. Liebknecht, while in Paris in September 1889, asked Engels to write to 
A. Bebel and ask him about monetary aid to the French Workers' Party in 
connection with the forthcoming parliamentary elections. W. Liebknecht 
received the necessary information from P. Lafargue in his letter of 10 
August 1889. On 28 September the newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat (no. 39) 
in its editorial on the French elections carried reports from Paris calling on

Notes 595 
the German Socialists to display internationalist solidarity and help the 
French Socialists in securing Guesde's election to the Chamber of Deputies. 
513. W. Liebknecht 's statement concerning the publication of M. Schlesinger's 
book Die soziale Frage in the Volksbibliothek series (see note 400) was 
prompted by the article 'Ein sozialdemokratischer Antimarxist' published by 
the newspaper Die Kreuz-zeitung on 18 September 1889 (no. 435). In his 
statement of 27 September, Liebknecht wrote that the Volksbibliothek had no 
connection 'with the Social Democratic Party and its Reichstag faction' and 
that the printing of Schlesinger's book was undertaken without his consent. 
Liebknecht 's statement was published in the newspapers Berliner Volksblatt 
on 29 September and Der Sozialdemokrat on 5 October 1889. Carried simul­
taneously with this statement was one made by A. Bebel on 19 September 
1889,  refuting the assertion of Die Kreuz-Zeitung about the connections of 
the Volksbibliothek with the Social Democratic faction in the Reichstag and 
about Schlesinger's membership in the Social Democratic Party. 
514. At the general election of 22 September 1889, Georges Boulanger was 
elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the Montmartre constituency of 
Paris.  Yet his election, as well as that of his close associates, Victor 
Rochefort and Dillon, was overruled by the Minister of the Interior E. 
Constant on the grounds of all the men having been convicted, in absentia, 
by the Supreme Court and sentenced to banishment (see note 391). The 
Possibilist Jules Joffrin therefore became deputy in Boulanger's place -
Joffrin polled the second largest number of votes, 5,500, in the Montmartre 
constituency (after Boulanger). 
515. An allusion to P. Lafargue's pamphlet of the same name, published by 
Égalité in 1880 and appearing in a separate edition in 1833; Le droit a la 
paresse. Réfutation du Droit au Travail de 1848, Paris. 
516. The bourgeois republican Jules Ferry, nominated from the department of 
Vosges, suffered an electoral defeat. Engels mentions an article in The Daily 
News of 8 October 1889, published under the title 'The French Elections. 
Composition of the New Chamber'. 
517. 'The Satisfied' ('Les satisfaits') - the reactionary majority of the French 
Chamber of Deputies that backed the Guizot government on the eve of the 
1848 Revolution. They were called this after saying they were 'satisfied' 
with the government explanations of corruption among the ruling quarters. 
This issue was discussed at the Chamber of Deputies in February 1848. 
518. Engels referred to the Rue Poitiers Committee, the steering body of a 'Party 
of Order' which was formed in 1848 as a coalition of two monarchist 
groups: the Legitimists (adherents of the Bourbon dynasty) and the 
Orléanists (adherents of the Orléans dynasty). Representing the interests of 
the big conservative bourgeoisie, this party held a dominating position in 
the legislative assembly of the Second Republic from 1849 down to the coup 
d'état of 2 December 1851.

shared the views of the 'Nationalists' at the time (see note 503).

523. On 19 October 1889, Max Hildebrand wrote to Engels that he had, for 
more than 15 years, been interested in Europe's democratic movement. 
Accordingly, he had studied a number of works, among which of particular 
interest to him was Max Stirner's book Der Einzige und Sein Eigenthum. 
Hildebrand asked Engels for some information on Stirner's life and 
suggested that he, Engels, write historical biographies of thinkers repre­
senting different ideological trends, provided no such biographies had been 
written before. 
524. As a student of Berlin University, Marx lived in Berlin from the latter half 
of October 1836 to mid April 1841. 
525. Engels refers to his stay in Manchester in 1842-44 where he was studying 
commercial business at the cotton mill belonging to the firm Ermen & 
Engels (see note 9). 
526. Marx lived in Brussels from February 1845 to the beginning of March 1848 
when he was expelled by the Belgian authorities. Engels lived in Brussels, 
on and off, from early April 1845 to the latter half of March 1848. 
527. A critique of Stirner's views was made in Volume I of The German 
Ideology, in Chapter III entitled 'Saint Max' (see present edition, Vol. 5, 
ppl 17-451). 
528. Engels replies to Hildebrand's suggestion to write the history of the period 
preceding the Revolution of 1848-49 in Germany. As Hildebrand observed 
in his letter, Engels was perhaps the only person capable of tackling such a 
work (see this volume, note 523). 
529. O.A. Ellissen, who intended to write a book about Friedrich Lange, had 
found Engels' letters in his personal archives. He therefore asked Engels to 
give him Lange's letters (addressed to Engels) and allow him to use their 
correspondence in his book. Engels made the following marginal notes on 
Ellissen's letter, 'The letters are out of order and cannot be made available 
before the completion, next spring, of Vol. Ill; then they will be at your 
disposal. They may be reproduced in full or in part - in the latter case I beg 
you to give the respective excerpts in their total context'. Einbeck, Okt. 89.

530. The reference is to the slogan 'Fatherland in Danger' ('La patrie en danger') 
proclaimed by the French Legislative Assembly on  11 July 1792, i.e., during 
the French Revolution of the late 18th century. The Assembly issued an 
appeal to the army and the French people in which it called on everybody 
to rise in the struggle for liberty and Constitution. 
531. The Communist League was the first German and international organisa­
tion of the proletariat, and was formed under the leadership of Marx and 
Engels in London early in June 1847, as a result of the reorganisation of the 
League of the Just (a secret association of workers and artisans that 
appeared in the 1830s and had communities in Germany, France, 
Switzerland and England). The League's members took an active part in the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany in 1848-49. In 1849 and 1850, 
after the defeat or the revolution, the League was reorganised and thus 
continued its activities. In the summer of 1850 disagreements arose between 
the supporters of Marx and Engels and the sectarian Willich-Schapper 
group, which resulted in a split within the league. Owing to police persecu­
tions and arrests of League members in May 1851, the Communist League 
as an organisation actually ceased its activities in Germany. On 17 
November 1852, on a motion from Marx, the London District announced 
the dissolution of the League. 
532. On 3 March 1848, a mass demonstration took place in Cologne, called by 
the local representatives of the Communist League. On behalf of all those 
taking part, Andreas Gottschalk handed a petition to the town magistrate 
with demands for democratic freedom and for protection of working men's 
rights.  The police dispersed this demonstration; A. Gottschalk, Willich and 
F. Anneke were arrested and brought to trial. However, under a royal 
pardon, the three men were released from custody on 21 March 1848. 
533. On 26 October 1889, W. Liebknecht wrote to Engels and asked if he knew 
when A. Gottschalk could have made the following statement: T am here on 
behalf of 20,000 proletarians who do not care at all whether we have a 
republic or a monarchy'. 
534. The Cologne Workers' Association was a workers' organisation founded by 
Andreas Gottschalk on 13 April 1848. The Association was led by the 
President and the committee, which consisted of representatives of various 
trades. After Gottschalk's arrest Moll was elected President. He held this 
post till a state of siege was proclaimed in Cologne in September 1848, when 
he had to emigrate under threat of arrest. On 16 October Marx agreed to 
assume this post temporarily at the request of Association members. In 
November Röser became acting President and on 28 February 1849, 
Schapper was elected President and remained at this post until the end of 
May 1849. The majority of the leading members (Gottschalk, Anneke, 
Schapper, Moll, Lessner, Jansen, Röser, Nothjung, Bedorf) were members of 
the Communist League. During the initial period of its existence, the

Workers' Association was influenced by Gottschalk who, sharing many of 
the views of the 'true socialists', ignored the historical tasks of the prole­
tariat in the democratic revolution, carried on the sectarian tactics of 
boycotting indirect elections to the Federal and Prussian National 
Assemblies, and came out against supporting democratic candidates in elec­
tions.  He combined ultra-left phrases with very legalistic methods of strug­
gle (workers' petitions to the Government and the City Council, etc.) and 
supported the demands of the workers affected by craft prejudices, etc. 
From the very beginning, Gottschalk's tactics were resisted by the support­
ers of Marx and Engels. Under their influence, at the end of June a change 
occurred in the activities of the Workers' Association, which became a 
centre of revolutionary agitation from the autumn of 1848 onwards, also 
among the peasants. Members of the Association organised democratic and 
workers' associations near Cologne, disseminated revolutionary literature, 
including the 'Demands of the Communist Party in Germany', and studied 
Marx's writings. The Association maintained close contacts with other 
workers' and democratic organisations. When, in the spring of 1849, Marx 
and Engels took steps to organise the advanced workers on a national scale 
and actually started preparing for the creation of a proletarian party, they 
relied to a considerable extent on the Cologne Workers' Association. 
535. On 26 October 1889, W. Liebknecht informed Engels that he had declined 
to take part in the publication of the Volksbibliothek (see note 400), a move 
that incurred significant material losses. 
536. This is in reply to P. Martignetti's letter of 30 October 1889, in which he 
wrote about the sentence passed on him by the Naples court for alleged 
forgery and destruction of documents, as well as for alleged misappropria­
tion of a sum which, at various stages of the court proceedings, ranged from 
15 thousand to 500 liras. Martignetti, sentenced to a prison term of 3 years 
and 9 months, asked Engels for help in job finding and for advice on what 
to do under the circumstances - either emigrate and part with his family, or 
serve his prison term. 
537. In his letter of 17 October 1889, A. Bebel criticised the French Socialists for 
their poor propaganda and organisational work. 
538. A reference to the National Council in Bordeaux and the Executive 
Commission in Troyes, set up in 1888 at a labour unions congress in 
Bordeaux and at a Workers' Party Congress in Troyes, respectively (see 
notes 329; 331). 
539. During the election campaign of September 1889 the French Workers' Party 
and the Central Revolutionary Committee of the Blanquists (see note 33) 
issued a joined manifesto, signed by Guesde, Lafargue and Vaillant and 
circulated in more than 100 towns. 
540. On the eve of the parliamentary election of 1889, E. Protot mounted a 
campaign of slander against  J. Guesde in Marseilles with the aim of prevent-

ing him from being elected to the Chamber of Deputies. Protot accused 
Guesde of espionage for the German Government: he claimed that in 1879, 
as editor-in-chief of the newspaper Égalité, Guesde had received 4 thousand 
francs from Höhberg, allegedly the chief of the German police. Sued by 
Guesde for libel, Protot was sentenced to a fine. Under the court decision, 
Marseilles and Paris newspapers carried a report about the sentence. 
541. P. Lafargue wrote to Engels in his letter of 4 November 1889, about the plan 
to set up Socialist factions in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Municipal 
Council; this initiative came from J. Guesde, E. Vaillant, G. Deville and P. 
Lafargue. He said that if this plan came off, the parliamentary faction should 
issue a declaration, stating its independent and socialist stand and setting the 
objective of inducing the Chamber of Deputies to give a legal seal to the 
decisions of the International Working Men's Congress of 1889. The unifi­
cation of the Guesdists and the Blanquists into the Socialist Party of France 
took body and form at the Rheims Congress of September 1903. 
542. In his letter of 17 October 1889, A. Bebel told Engels about I. Auer's 
nervous disease and his stay at Zurich for treatment. The newspaper Der 
Sozialdemokrat (19 October, No. 42) reported Auer's plans to move south 
after treatment. In Switzerland Auer had been collecting documents on the 
subject 'The Law on the Socialists in Ten Years' Time'. 
543. The reference is to the letter of J.H. Johnson and G.B. Ellis to F. Engels of 
7 November 1889, in which they requested him for the opinions of the 
passengers aboard the steamship The City of New York about the perfor­
mance of the ship's circulating pumps. 
544. Mr Boulé, representing the French syndicats, was running as a Socialist 
candidate at the by election in Paris in January 1889; thereupon, at a munic­
ipal election in the department of Haute Marne, he nominated his candidacy 
as a Boulanger supporter. As a result, he forfeited his post of Secretary of 
the Federation of Syndical Chambers in Paris in the autumn of 1889. The 
newspaper Le Parti ouvrier exposed Boulé in J. Vidal's article 'Exécution 
d'un traître' published on 26 October. The newspaper Intransigeant on 29 
October carried E. Roche's article in Boulé's defence and, on 2, 3 and 5 
November it featured a series of Boulé's articles on the port workers' strike 
at Bourget. 
545. Probably a reference to Le Cri du Travailleur (Lisle), Le Salariat (Rouen) 
and L'Action sociale (Lyon). 
546. Engels had received from Lafargue an article by C. de Paepe; published by 
the Belgian press, it contained a report on Nikolai Chernyshevsky's death. 
547. Laura Lafargue made a translation of Béranger's poem Le Sénateur. Laura 
added a postscript to Paul Lafargue's letter to Engels of 4 November 1889 
in which she asked for his opinion about the quality of the translation. 
548. In her letter of 14 November 1889, Laura Lafargue told Engels about the 
reaction of the French bourgeois press to Christophe Thivrier, a coal miner,

appearing in the Chamber of Deputies in working clothes among the other 
Socialists. 
549. In September-December 1889, there was a strike in Silvertown, a district in 
London's East End, by workers engaged in the production of underwater 
cables and rubber articles. The strikers, about three thousand strong, 
demanded higher pay rates (both hourly and piecework rates), higher pay 
for overtime and on holidays, as well as higher wages for women and chil­
dren. Eleanor Marx-Aveling was actively involved in the organisation of 
this strike, during which she helped form the Women's Branch of the Gas 
Union. The strike, which continued for nearly three months, ended in fail­
ure: the Silvertown workers were supported by other unions, notably the 
Gas Workers and the Dockers unions. 
550. A reference to the siege of Paris by the Prussian army during the Prusso-
French War of  1870-71.  The siege was on from 19 September 1870 to the 
signing of an armistice between France and Germany on 28 January 1871. 
551. An allusion to the electoral campaign of September-October 1889 in France. 
Jules Guesde was running for the Chamber of Deputies as a candidate from 
one of the constituencies in Marseilles but failed to be elected (see also note 
465). 
552. Engels cites a call to the voters at the end of the Manifesto of the French 
Workers' Party (see note 33) and the Central Revolutionary Committee of 
the Blanquists (see note 539). 
553. In his letter of 23 October 1889, P. Martignetti asked Engels to recommend 
him, through P. Lafargue's mediation, to Antonio Labriola. Engels' letter to 
P. Lafargue is not available now. 
554. An abridged text of the letter was first published in English in Marx K. and 
Engels F., Correspondence, 1846-1895, Lawrence, London 1934, pp457-58. 
The English version of this letter was published in full in Marx K. and 
Engels F., Selected Correspondence, Foreign Languages Publishing House, 
Moscow 1955, pp405-407. 
555. 9th Thermidor (27-28 July 1794) was the date of a counterrevolutionary 
coup which brought the big bourgeoisie to power. About the events of 10 
August 1792, see note 363. 
556. Le Comité de salut public (Committee of Public Safety) was established by 
the Convention on 6 April 1793; during the Jacobin dictatorship (2 June 
1793-27 July 1794) it was the leading body of the revolutionary government 
in France. 
557. The Peace of Basle was concluded on 5 April 1795 between France and 
Prussia, the latter being a member of the first anti-French coalition. This 
treaty came as a consequence of the French victories as well as of the differ­
ences among the members of the coalition, in particular between Prussia 
and Austria. 
558. The Directory was the regime established in France as a result of the over-

throw of the Jacobin government on 27 July (9 Thermidor) 1794, and the 
introduction, on 4 November 1795, by the Thermidor Convention, of a 
new anti-democratic constitution. Supreme executive power was concen­
trated in the hands of five Directors. The Directory, whose rule was marked 
by unrestrained profiteering and speculation, continued until the coup 
d'état of 9 November (18 Brumaire) 1799 leading to the personal rule of 
General Napoleon Bonaparte. 
559. K.F. Keppen's article 'Leo's Geschichte der Revolution' was published in 
Die Rheinische Zeitung (Nos. 139, 141 and 142) on 21 and 22 May 1842. 
560. The whereabouts of this letter is not known. 
561. Engels received N. Danielson's letter of 26 November in which N. 
Danielson summed up the gist of the letter sent by the editors of the Russian 
journal Northern Review to P. Lafargue concerning the intended publica­
tion in it of  P. Lafargue's article about the evolution of property. 
562. Karl Marx Capital Part I, Ch. Ill, 'Money, Or the Circulation of commodi­

563. The English translation of a fragment of this letter was first published in 
Marx K. and Engels F., Correspondence 1846-1895, London, 1934, pp460-62. 
564. In these letters F. Sorge aired his views about the split within the Socialist 
Labor Party of North America. 
565. The Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union was the first trade union 
of general and unskilled workers in the history of the British working-class 
movement; it was formed late in March - early in April 1889 against the 
background of the growing strike movement of the 1880s and 1890s. 
Eleanor Marx-Aveling and E. Aveling did much for the organisation of this 
union and for its guidance. The Union put forward a demand for a legisla­
tive enactment of an eight-hour working day. Within a brief space of time, 
it gained considerable influence - as many as 100,000 gas workers joined it 
within a year. It took an active part in organising the London dockers' strike 
of 1889 (see note 489). 
566. A reference to P. Rappaport's article in the newspaper Indiana Tribune, sent 
to Engels by F. Sorge. 
567. Hepner participated in the work of the conventions held by two conflicting 
groups within the Socialist Labor Party of North America in Chicago (see 
note 3). Sorge remarked in this connection in his letter to Engels of 18 
October 1889, that 'Hepner wanted to play a non-partisan's part and went 
to Chicago to attend both conventions so-called'. 
568. Writing to Engels on 29 October 1889, Sorge asked if he knew about the fate 
of a list of Marx's articles in the New York Daily Tribune which he, Sorge, 
had given to Marx in 1872, as well as of the clippings from the correspond­
ing numbers of the paper. The list of Marx's articles for the Tribune had 
been compiled by Hermann Meier; Sorge had handed it to Marx during 
their meeting at the Hague Congress of the First International.

569. The Elberfeld trial of members of the German Social Democratic Party took 
place from 18 November to 30 December 1889. Brought to trial were 87 
party members, among them A. Bebel (Reichstag deputy), F. Harm, G. 
Schumacher, K. Grillenberger and E. Röllinghoff. The aim of this put-up 
trial - which the Social Democratic press described as a Monster trial and 
compared to the Cologne trial of the Communist League of 1853, staged by 
the Prussian police - was to prove the existence of a 'secret alliance' led by 
the Social Democratic faction of the Reichstag with a far-flung network 
throughout Germany. About 500 witnesses were summoned to testify. 
However, the government failed in its attempt to have all the defendants 
convicted. Forty-three, A. Bebel among them, were acquitted, while the 
others received prison terms ranging from 14 days to 6 months. 
570. The English translation of a fragment of this letter was first published in 
Marx K., Engels F., On Literature and Art, Progress Publishers, Moscow 
1984. 
571. A fragment of this letter in English was first published in the collection 
Marx, Engels, Selected Correspondence, Foreign Languages, Publishing 
House, Moscow 1956, pp491-92. 
572. Trier, writing to Engels on 8 December 1889, told him about the differences 
within the Danish Social Democratic Party over the issue of a possible bloc 
with the bourgeois Left-Radical parties at the forthcoming election to the 
Riksdag; he also wrote about a controversy between the party leadership 
and the opposition, involving party members who did not agree with the 
leaders' policies. 
573. The primogeniture principle was the right of the eldest son in the family or 
kin to inherit his father's estate. This was instituted by the feudal law of 
England, France, Germany and other West European countries in the 11th-
13th centuries with the aim of keeping landed estates intact and preventing 
their fragmentation among many heirs. Only the eldest son was eligible to 
inherit. 
574. A reference to a constitutional conflict in Denmark which began in 1875 
and which manifested itself in a struggle between the government and the 
liberal opposition in Parliament, pressing for constitutional limits to the 
King's powers. Financial issues sparked off an acute controversy between 
the government and the parliamentary majority. Proceeding from Article 49 
of the Constitution, according to which no tax could be levied in the 
absence or a parliamentary decision, the Folketing (lower house) would 
every now and then, beginning with 1877, reject budget bills tabled by the 
government. The government responded by introducing a provisional 
budget - it gave a loose interpretation of Article 25 of the Constitution 
which empowered the King, if need be, to issue provisional legislative enact­
ments. The conflict continued until 1894 when the government and the 
liberal opposition came to some sort of settlement.

575. 'Physical force' was the name given to one of the two trends in the Chartist 
movement. In contrast to the other trend, the 'moral force' Chartists, it 
opted for revolutionary methods, for the independence of the Chartist 
movement and against its subordination to the bourgeois radicals. 
576. The General Association of German Workers was set up on 23 May 1863 at 
a meeting of worker societies in Leipzig. The founding of this political 
organisation, which included some of the members of the former 
Communist League (see note 531), contributed to the subsequent progress 
of the German labour movement and its emancipation from the ideological 
sway of the liberal bourgeoisie. Lassalle and his followers were agitating for 
universal suffrage which, as they deemed, could help the working people 
take on power in the state. A new democratic body politic, as Lassalle and 
his supporters saw it, was to provide a credit for setting up workers' 
production associations (see also note 508). 
577. The Gas Workers Strike in South London took place in December 1889, 
February 1890. It was touched off by the failure of the company owners to 
honour the earlier agreement on an eight-hour working day, higher wages, 
and employment priority for unionised workers, members of the Gas 
Workers' and General Labourers' Union (see note 565). Among other 
things, the strikers demanded that three activists of the Union, dismissed 
from their job, be reinstated. The strike action did not succeed in the 
absence of vigorous support from other unions, the dockers' union in 
particular. 
578. An allusion to W Liebknecht 's letter of 20 December about the Elberfeld 
trial and his own difficult conditions. 
579. Herewith Engels sent to S.M. Kravchinsky (Stepniak) the first chapter of his 
work The Foreign Policy of Russian Tsardom (see present edition, Vol. 27) 
so as to have it published in the Russian literary and political journal Social 
Democrat run by the 'Emancipation of Labour' group; among its editors 
were V.l. Zasulich, G.V. Plekhanov and P.V. Axelrod (see also note 623). 
580. In her letter of 31 December 1889, Laura Lafargue complained that for her 
translation of Walther von der Vogelweide's poem Unter der Linden, she 
had only an updated edition of the text. 
581. Writing to Engels on 24 December 1889, P. Lafargue told him about the 
French Workers' Party (see note 33) planning to start a new daily. In keep­
ing with the terms of an entrepreneur who had agreed to finance the news­
paper, the editorial staff was supposed to work without remuneration, with 
the exception of J. Guesde and Quercy. It was somewhat later that this daily 
was launched. Engels' letter to C. Bonnier is not available. 
582. A reference to the proceedings to have Engels' nephews - Hermann, Moritz 
and Emil - made co-owners of the firm Ermen & Engels at Engelskirchen. 
583. A fragment of this letter was first published in English in: Marx K. and 
Engels F., Correspondence, 1846-1895, Lawrence, London, 1934, pp463-64.

584. F. Schlüter, in his letter to F. Engels of 12 December 1889, wrote this: 'Last 
week I sent you a number of the Commonweal with the image of a tree that 
had been baptised after our Marx'. 
585. In his letter to Engels on 20 December 1889, F. Schlüter asked him to make 
inquiries about a George Reid, who had come to New York City from 
London and who was agitating among stevedores and seamen. In Schlüter's 
opinion, Reid was acting in the spirit of Hyndman's sectarian policies: 'For 
about three months there has been a certain George G. Reid here who says 
that he has been sent from London to organise longshoremen and seamen 
employed in the port ... The longshoremen are beginning to mistrust him. 
No attempt has been made to learn more about him.' 
586. A reference to the Amalgamated Engineers' Society, founded by W. 
Newton and W. Allen in 1851 and known as the first trade union of a 'new 
type'. 
587. The London Trades Council was elected at a conference of trade union dele­
gates held in London in May 1860. The Council headed the London trade 
unions, numbering many thousands and was fairly influential among the 
British workers. In the first half of the 1860s it led the British workers' 
campaign against intervention in the Civil War in the United States, in 
defence of Poland and Italy, and later for the legislation of the trade unions. 
The leaders of the large trade unions played a major role in the Council. 
588. Appended to this was a letter of recommendation from Engels; the rough 
draft of this letter is extant. 
589. Refers to the socialist club Vorwärts, founded in Buenos Aires in January 
1882 by German socialist emigres - H. Lalman, A. Kuhn and F. Weber. In 
1886 this club launched the newspaper Vorwärts which advocated socialist 
ideas and called for strike action to secure better working and living condi­
tions. 
590. Engels sent the present note to Eleanor Marx-Aveling., together with 
Bonnier's letter to Engels of 14 January 1890. Engels sent this letter to 
Eleanor Aveling at Bonnier's request. It was a continuation of Bonnier's talk 
with Engels about the French Workers' Party preparing to start a newspa­
per of its own (see also note 33). This plan only materialised in September 
1890,  as the party resumed the publication of its weekly newspaper Le 
Socialiste, which became its central organ. In his letter Bonnier asked 
Eleanor Marx-Aveling for her comments on the Gas Workers' strike (see 
note 577) for the French newspaper Le Cri du travailleur. 
591. These lines were on a post card, with the following address at the back: H. 
Schlüter Esq., 73, First Avenue, New York City, US America. 
592. The English version of a fragment from this letter was published in the 
collection Marx K., Engels F., Ireland and the Irish Question, Progress 
Publishers, Moscow 1971. 
593. Engels hints at acute differences - which came into the open during the

Elberfeld trial of 1889 - between A. Bebel, the state prosecutor and the 
defence, as testified by Bebel's speech of 27 December, published in the 
Freie Presse (Nos. 302 and 303) on 28 and 29 December. 
594. Refers to the discussion in the German Reichstag of a draft bill for amend­
ing the then effective Anti-Socialist Law (see note 52). The suggested 
amendments aimed above all at converting the provisional legislation 
against the Socialists into a permanent law; they provided for more rigorous 
regulations with respect to periodicals, etc. The draft law also envisaged 
banishing, for up to a year, all those whose activity might pose 'a threat to 
public tranquillity and order'. The draft law, discussed at Reichstag sessions 
on 5 and 6 November 1889, and then again on 22, 23 and 25 January 1890, 
was turned down by 169 votes versus 98. 
595. A reference to A. Bebel's report carried by Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 3) on 
17 January 1890, in the feature 'Ausland, Deutschland'; this report was 
marked: Berlin, 14 January. 
596. The National-Liberal Party, the party of the German and, above all, the 
Prussian bourgeoisie, formed in the autumn of 1866 as a result of the split 
of the Party of Progress. The policies of the National-Liberals reflected the 
capitulation of a significant part of the liberal bourgeoisie to Bismarck's 
Junker government, after Prussia's victory in the Austro-Prussian war of 
1866 and its subsequent pre-eminence in Germany. 
597. During the second balloting of February 1887 at the Reichstag election the 
supporters of the Party of Progress voted for candidates of the 'Kartell' (see 
note 265) and thus promoted the victory of a bloc backing the Bismarck 
government. 
598. In April 1886 the Liberal government of  W. Gladstone tabled a draft Home 
Rule Bill in the Commons (see note 175) providing for reinstitution of the 
bicameral Irish parliament after the late 18th century model; the British 
government was to retain its control over the country's economy and have 
a free hand in exercising all foreign policy, military and police functions. 
599. Another regular election to the German Reichstag was scheduled for 20 
February 1890 (see note 612). Eventually the Social Democratic candidates 
polled  1,427,298  votes or nearly 20 per cent of the total ballots cast. The 
Social Democrats could thus claim 35 seats in the Reichstag, which meant 
an astounding victory for the party. 
600. On 20 January 1890 the Socialist leader August Bebel addressed an election 
rally, many thousand strong. Concluding his speech, he called on all those 
present to execute their duty on 20 February by electing representatives of 
the Social Democratic Party to the Reichstag. Bebel's speech was published 
by the newspaper Hamburger Echo  (No.  18) on 22 January under the head­
line 'Reichstagsabgeordneter August Bebel vor seinen Wählern'. 
601. The Franco-Russian alliance - a military and political alliance between 
France and Russia; it took shape against a background of the growing might

of the German Reich and dramatic exacerbation of the Franco-German and 
Russo-German contradictions. As a first step, France and Russia signed a 
political agreement on 15 August 1891. The two countries concluded a 
secret military convention on 15 August 1892. 
602. Engels must have meant Gladstone's speech at a Liberal meeting in Chester 
on 22 January 1890; in it the British statesman censured the actions of the 
Turkish government in Crete and Armenia (see The Times, 23 January, No. 
32, 916, plO, 'Mr Gladstone at Chester'). 
603. W. Liebknecht 's communication was published in Der Sozialdemokrat, No. 
1, 4 January 1890, in the regular feature 'Aus Frankreich'. In his letter to 
Engels of 24 December 1889, P. Lafargue laid down a detailed plan for 
launching the newspaper. 
604. A fragment of this letter was first published in English by The Communist, 
N-Y 1929, Vol. VIII, No. 5, May, pp263-64.

who were mainly natives of Upper Silesia. Subsequently it became wide­
spread in Germany as a nickname for Silesian Poles. 
606. Speaking of the Schleswig-Holsteiners, Engels means the tribes of Angles, 
Jutes and Saxons who, in the early centuries A.D., used to populate the 
southern part of Jutland, a peninsula which, since the l4th century, has come 
to be known as Schleswig-Holstein. 
607. Engels refers to the editorial comments in The Labour Elector (Vol. Ill, No. 
57, 1 February 1890 and Vol. Ill, No. 56, 25 January 1890), which 
condemned E. Parke's attacks on Lord Euston. The  1 February issue carried 
protests from T. Mann, G. Bateman and others. The editors do not have at 
their disposal the numbers of The Star with the below mentioned materials. 
608. In April 1889 a conflict flared up between Portugal and Britain over the 
latter's influence in some of the East African territories which Portugal 
regarded as a sphere of its interests. In November 1890 and in May 1891 
both countries signed agreements on settling the border disputes. Portugal 
allowed free passage and ship navigation for the British in their African 
possessions. The Labour Elector (Vol. Ill, No. 56, 25 January 1890, p51) 
carried an article entitled 'True Patriots All'; it justified the policy of the 
British government. 
609. Engels means A. Bebel's report which Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (No. 6) of 7 
February 1890, carried in its regular feature 'Ausland: Deutschland'. The 
report was marked: Berlin, 4 February. The two edicts, promulgated by 
Emperor William II on 4 February 1890, on the eve of an election to the 
German Reichstag, actually amounted to a government pre-election 
programme. 
In his first edict, the Emperor instructed the Reichskanzler to appeal to 
the governments of a number of European countries with the proposal to 
convene an international conference on a unified labour legislation. (Such a 

=====第618页=====
Notes 607 
conference was indeed held in Berlin in March 1890.) In his second edict, 
addressed to the Ministers of Public Works, Trade and Industry, William II 
expressed the desire to revise the existing labour legislation with the aim of 
improving the condition of workers employed at government-run and 
private enterprises. 
610. As the new draft legislation against the Socialists was put to a vote in the 
Reichstag (see note 52), the deputies from the National Liberal Party voted 
against the additional clause providing for the banishment from Germany 
of 'undesirable persons' involved in the revolutionary movement. 
611. The reference is to R. Puttkamer's election speech at Stolpe on 31 January 
1890,  against a repeal of the Anti-Socialist law (see note 52). In it he 
expressed the hope that the army and the Civil Service, loyal to the govern­
ment, would be guarantors of order (Ordnung) in Germany. However 
Puttkamer did not rule out the government having to impose a major state 
of siege (instead of a 'minor' one). The minor state of 'siege' was envisaged 
by Clause 28 of the Anti-Socialist Law; the governments of German states, 
with the consent of the Federal Council, could impose a stage of siege for 
one year in certain districts and localities. In this case no meeting or assem­
bly could take place without permission of the police; it was forbidden to 
circulate printed matter in public places; politically unreliable persons were 
to be deported from a given locality; the right to have or hold arms, their 
import and sale were prohibited or restricted. 
612. 1 March 1890 was the date of the second round of an election to the German 
Reichstag; the first round was held on 20 February 1890. As many as 20 
socialist deputies were elected in the first round, and 15 in the runoff (see 
also note 599). 
613. The reference is to the German Party of Free Thinkers (Freisinnigen) formed 
in 1884 with the unification of the Party of Progress and the left-wing 
National-Liberals (see note 45). One of the leaders of the party thus formed 
was Richter, a Reichstag deputy. Reflecting the interests of the middle and 
petty bourgeoisie, this party was in opposition to the Bismarck government. 
The National-Liberals - a right-wing bourgeois political party between 1867 
and 1918, first on the Prussian scale and, as of 1871, as an all-German party; 
one of the bulwarks of the bloc of the Junkers and the bourgeoisie. 
614. Engels means the interview by a correspondent of the newspaper Gaulois 
with P. Lafargue and P. Roche about the attitude of the Socialists to the 
proposal made by Emperor William II to convene an international confer­
ence on unified labour legislation (see note 609). This interview was 
published on 3 March 1890, in the regular feature 'En Allemagne'. 
615. In the course of the election to the German Reichstag, the Social Democrats 
gained votes in 6 constituencies of Brandenburg, Pomerania (Stettin) and 
East Prussia; in 3 constituencies of Mecklenburg, and in 4 constituencies of 
Schleswig-Holstein.

608 Notes 
616. The horrible conditions of political exiles in Siberia were described by 
George Kennan, an American journalist, in his series of articles 'Siberia and 
the Exile System', which he wrote after his journey thither in 1885-86 and 
which were published by the New York-based journal The Century 
Illustrated Monthly Magazine (Vol. XXXVII, November 1888, No. 1; Vol. 
XXXIX, April 1890, No. 6, London). In 1889-91 this work vas published in 
separate editions in English, German and Russian. 
617. At the election of 20 February 1890, W. Liebknecht polled 42, 274 votes in 
the 6th constituency, while the 'Free Thinkers' (see note 613) got 14,195 
votes as representatives of the cartel (see note 265) 10,836. 
618. At the 20 February election the Social Democratic Party received 664,170 
votes more than in 1887. 
619. This refers to an article in the Dutch socialist newspaper Recht voor Allen. 
620. The main part of this letter, which P. Martignetti had sent to the editorial 
board of the journal Cuore e critica, was published in Italian in No. 7 of this 
journal on 16 April 1890, under the heading 'L'opinione di F. Engels'. This 
publication was prefaced with the following editorial text: 'Professor 
Labriola's proposal concerning the settlement of the colony of Eritrea is 
also finding support abroad. After reading the letters of Professors Labriola 
and Loria in II Messaggero, Frederick Engels wrote from London on 30 
March to our regular contributor P. Martignetti'. 
621. A reference to the project to use free land (terra libera) in the Italian 
colonies, as suggested by Antonio Labriola in his letter to Baccarini. Part of 
this letter was published on 15 March 1890 by the journal 77 Messaggero 
under the heading 'La terra a chi la lavora'. Martignetti sent this number of 
the journal to Engels. 
622. Refers to Antonio Labriola's letter to Achille Loria published by the jour­
nal Il Messaggero on 15 March 1890 under the title 'La terra a chi la lavora 
- La colonia Eritrea e la questione sociale'. A. Labriola sent this publication 
to P. Martignetti who, in his turn, forwarded it to F. Engels. 
623. The present work was prompted by a proposal for co-operation which Vera 
Zasulich, on behalf of the editors of the Russian journal Social Democrat, 
then being prepared for publication in London, addressed to F. Engels (see 
also V. Zasulich's letter to F. Engels of 30 January 1890). Complying with 
this request Engels sent his article to the editorial board for publication in 
Russian translation; he likewise decided to have it published in other social­
ist periodicals (see Engels' letter to  V. Zasulich of 3 April 1890 this volume, 
pp467-69). The first part of this work appeared in February 1890 under the 
title 'The Foreign Policy of Russian Tsardom'. The latter part of the article 
was published only in August 1890. Meanwhile, the first two parts appeared 
in the language of the original, German, in the April number of the journal 
Die Neue Zeit; the editors amended the text without Engels' knowledge. 
Thus they softened somewhat the characterisation of the ruling heads of

Notes 609 
Russia and Prussia, representatives of the Hohenzollern dynasty, among 
other things. Engels discovered this editorial tampering as he compared the 
Russian translation with the German text (see also his letter to J. Dietz of 1 
April 1890). The May issue of Die Neue Zeit carried these two parts with­
out amendments, together with the third part. Indicated at the end of this 
publication was the date Engels had completed the article: London, end of 
February 1890. 
624. In her letter to Engels late in March 1890, Vera Zasulich asked him for the 
text of the last, third, chapter of the article 'The Foreign Policy of Russian 
Tsardom' (present edition, Vol. 26) so as to have it published together with 
the second chapter in Book II of the Social Democrat. 
625. The February issue of Social Democrat (1890), which S.M. Stepniak-
Kravchinsky passed to Engels, carried  V. Zasulich's article 'Revolutionaries 
from the Bourgeois Midst' and G. Plekhanov's article 'N.G. 
Chernyshevsky'; the second part appeared in the August number of the 
journal. 
626. There was considerable unrest among Moscow University students in 
November 1867 over the activity of inspectors in conformity with the new 
university regulations of 1884 (which abolished the university self-rule 
introduced by the 1863 regulations as well as authorised the Education 
Minister to appoint or dismiss at his discretion professors and other 
members of the teaching  staff,  fix scholarships, grants and other allowances 
for students, decide on curricula, etc.). At the beginning of December 1887 
the student unrest spread to the universities and colleges of Kharkov, 
Odessa, Kazan and St Petersburg. Police and army units were thrown 
against the students. Many were expelled from college or university and 
exiled, and the most active were drafted into penal battalions. 
627. Thanks to the active engagement of S.M. Kravchinsky-Stepniak, a 'Russian 
Freedom Friends' Society' was organised in Britain in 1890; its aim was to 
enlist support for the Russian revolutionary movement. Between 1891-1900 
the Society published the newspaper Free Russia. 
628. The district in London where the editorial board of the newspaper Der 
Sozialdemokrat had its office. 
629. Stuttgart - the seat of the Dietz Publishers in charge of the journal Die Neue 
Zeit. 
630. In his letter dated 3-6 March 1890, F. Sorge communicated F. Schlüter's 
request to Engels to send - for publication in Die New Yorker Volkszeitung 
- the letters from the National-Liberal J. Miquel, a Reichstag deputy, which 
he had written to Engels during his membership in the Communist League 
(see note 531). 
631. Engels must have made a mistake by dating C. Schmidt's letter 25 February. 
Actually, C. Schmidt wrote to Engels on 26 February and 1 April; in these 
letters he told him about his possible visit to London and about his plans for

literary work. Schmidt also offered his assistance in the work on Marx's 
manuscripts. 
632. Engels refers to his Preface to volume II of Capital (see present edition, Vol. 
36). About the publication of Volume IV of Capital - Theories of Surplus 
Value - see note 353. 
633. On 3 July 1866 a decisive battle in the Austro-Prussian War was fought at 
Köninggrätz (Hradec-Kralove), near Sadova. The Austrian troops were 
defeated. About the battle of Sedan, see note 267. 
634. The Napoleonic Code - the code of French civil law, promulgated in 1804, 
exerted a great influence on legislation in many European and a number of 
Latin American European countries. 
635. The present letter is in reply to V. Zasulich's letter written around 10 April 
1890. 
636. Grigori Beck's article 'Erwiderung' ran a sharp critique of G. Plekhanov for 
his preface to the pamphlet Pytr Alexeyev's Speech; in it Plekhanov 
cautioned workers against 'the false friends' from among the liberal intelli­
gentsia. Published by Der Sozialdemokrat  (No.  14, 5 April 1890), this arti­
cle was written in reply to the report 'Aus der russischen Bewegung', 
carried by the same newspaper (No. 12) on 22 March and signed ZKW. On 
26 April 1890, Der Sozialdemokrat (No. 17) published a letter to the editors 
from Ossipowitch (probably, V. Zasulich's pseudonym) with a prefatory 
editor's note 'Über die Propaganda unter den russischen Arbeitern'. 
637. In her letter Vera Zasulich listed a number of Russian newspapers and 
magazines published in Switzerland in 1888-89: Svoboda (Freedom), Borba 
( Struggle), Samoupravlenie (Self-Government) and Svobodnaya Rossia. 
638. Dismal Swamp - boggy terrain in Virginia, USA. 
639. Michael Davitt - an eminent activist in the Irish national movement and a 
champion of a union between the working classes of Ireland and England. 
He supported the struggle of the new trade unions (see note 489) for a law 
on an eight-hour working day. However, he also suggested setting up inde­
pendent unions of English and Irish workers at every enterprise; this 
applied, in particular, to the Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union in 
London and Ulster (see note 565). 
640. The appeal of the Social Democratic parliamentary group in the Reichstag 
'An die Arbeiter und Arbeiterinnen Deutschland!' was adopted at its meet­
ing in Halle on 13 April 1890 and published in the newspaper Berliner 
Volksblatt on 15 April 1890. The appeal contained the party leadership's 
reply to the demand by the opposition of 'Die Jungen' ('The Young', see 
note 646) to stage a general strike on May 1. The appeal pointed to the 
danger of such a demand under the conditions of the still operating Anti-
Socialist law, after the Reichstag election of 20 February 1890, when all 
kinds of provocations were possible on the part of the ruling quarters. It 
appealed instead to German workers to give no support to the idea of a

Notes 611 
general strike and to resort to work stoppages only whenever a serious 
conflict could be avoided; otherwise it advised the workers not to go 
beyond holding demonstration and rallies. The May 1 strikes held in some 
German towns involved about ten per cent of the labour force. 
641. Part of this letter, in the language of the original, was first published in Die 
New Yorker Volksezeitung on 10 May 1890. A fragment of the letter was 
published in English for the first time in Labour Monthly, 1934, No. 5, 
pp309-ll. 
642. The Bloomsbury Socialist Society, which had the local branch of the 
Socialist League (see note 21) as a nucleus, took form as an independent 
organisation in August 1888, after breaking with the Socialist League where 
anarchist elements had gained the upper hand. The Society was led by E. 
Marx-Aveling and E. Aveling; one of its members was F. Lessner, a friend 
and associate of Marx and Engels. In subsequent years the Bloomsbury 
Socialist Society carried on active propaganda and agitation work in 
London's East End. It was one of the organisers of the May Day demon­
stration of 1890. Its representatives were among the Central Committee that 
organised a meeting in London's Hyde Park on 4 May 1890 (see note 643). 
643. The reference is to the 'Central Committee of representatives of ' new trade 
unions' and of radical and socialist clubs (about the radical clubs, see note 
22) set up for organising the 4 May demonstration in London. The 
Committee continued its activities in subsequent months in pursuit of the 
struggle for a law on a eight-hour working day and for implementing the 
decisions of the socialist International Working Men's Congress of 1889; it 
came out for setting up a workingmen's party. The leader of the Central 
Committee was E. Aveling, who maintained close contacts with Engels. In 
July 1890 the Committee gave rise to an organisation which came to be 
known as 'The Legal Eight Hours and International Labour League'. 
644. A. Bebel's report was published in Die Arbeiter-Zeitung, No. 17, on 25 
April 1890 in the regular feature: 'Ausland. Deutschland' and marked: 
'Berlin 22 April'. 
645. Replying to Engels on 9 April 1890 Bebel said he subscribed to Engels' 
opinion about the psychological condition of Emperor William II. 
646. Late in March 1890 a group of Berlin Social Democrats, Max Schippel 
among them, promulgated an appeal under the heading 'Was soil am 1 Mai 
geschehen?' in which it urged workmen to stage a general strike on that day. 
This appeal epitomised the position of the 'Young' - petty bourgeois, semi-
anarchist oppositional group within German Social Democracy that took 
shape in 1890. This group was led by college students and raw litterati 
(hence the name of the opposition, the 'Young') who would arrogate to 
themselves the role of the party's theoreticians and leaders - such men as 
Paul Ernst, Paul Kampfmeyer, Hans Müller, Prune Wille among others. 
Ignoring the changed situation for the party's activity after the repeal of the

612 Notes 
Anti-Socialist Law (see note 52), the 'Young' denied the legal forms of 
struggle and opposed Social Democrats taking part in the Reichstag elec­
tions and making use of the Reichstag as a political tribune; they would 
demagogically accuse the party and its Executive of promoting the interests 
of the petty bourgeoisie and of opportunism, of violating democracy within 
the party ranks. In October 1891 the Erfurt Congress of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany expelled some of the opposition leaders 
from the party. 
647. A reference to the first May Day demonstration of London workers held on 
Sunday, 4 May 1890. Despite the attempts of reformist trade union leaders 
and Henry Hyndman, a Socialist with opportunist leanings, to foist class 
collaborationist slogans on the demonstration, it showed the readiness of 
the broadest masses of London workers to wage a struggle for socialist 
demands. The bulk of the demonstrators - about 200,000 strong -
supported the slogans of the British supporters of Marx. Playing the chief 
role in the demonstration were Gas Workers and the London Dockers, who 
were the first to launch a struggle in the 1880s for 'new' mass trade unions 
to be set up (see note 489) and for legal eight hours. The demonstration 
culminated in a huge rally in London's Hyde Park. For more detail about 
the first May Day celebration and the demonstration of May 4 in London, 
see Engels' article 'May 4 in London' (present edition, Vol. 27). 
648. E. Bernstein's report carried in Berliner Volksblatt, No. 103, on 6 May 1890 
and marked: London, 4 May. 
649. The English text of the present letter was first published in The Labour 
Monthly, No. 8, 1955. 
650. The People's  Press  of 10 May 1890, devoted nearly 8 pages to the Hyde Park 
rally on 4 May (see note 647). 
651. The present letter was first published in English in: Engels F., Laf argue P. 
and L. Lafargue, Correspondence, Vol. 3, 1891-1895, Foreign Languages 
Publishing House, Moscow 1963, pp71. 
652. Engels cites from Nikolai Danielson's letter to him, 17 May 1890. The refer­
ence is to P. Lafargue's article about the evolution of property; this article 
was not published in the Northern Review. 
653. This refers to the dissolution of General Boulanger's National Republican 
Committee after a major defeat of his supporters at the municipal election 
in Paris on 27 April, 4 May 1890. 
654. The present letter was written on a post card; the corner of the leaf with a 
postage stamp is off. The reconstituted parts of the text are enclosed in the 
brackets. 
655. A fragment of this letter in English was first published in Labour Monthly, 
London 1934, No. 6, p380. 
656. A reference to an open letter of  F. Sorge and F. Schlüter to A. Sartorius von 
Waltershausen with a protest against the characterisation of Marx in the

book Der moderne Sozialismus in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika, 
Berlin, 1890. This letter was published by Der Sozialdemokrat, No. 22. 
657. A reference to 'The Legal Eight Hours and International Labour League' 
founded in 1890 by a group of British Socialists with E. Aveling and Eleanor 
Marx-Aveling at the head and with Engels' participation. The League 
sprang from the Central Committee that organised the first May Day 
demonstration in Britain in 1890. 
658. In view of the publication by the newspaper Volksstimme on 16 September 
1890 of P. Ernst's article distorting Engels' pronouncements and claiming 
him to have made common cause with the 'Young' (see note 646), Engels 
wrote an article entitled 'Reply to Mr Paul Ernst (see present edition, Vol. 
27) where he inserted part of the present letter. A fragment from this letter 
was first published in English in Ibsen, A Marxist Analysis, Angel Flores 
(ed),  Critics Group, New York 1937, pp21-24. 
659. Engels replies to P. Ernst's letter of 31 May 1890, in which the latter asked 
for help in his polemics with G. Bahr who had the journal Die Freie Bühne 
für modernes Leben, Heft 17, 28 Mai 1890, publish the article 'Zur 
Frauenfrage. Die Epigonen des Marxismus' which criticised Ernst's article 
'Die Frauenfrage und soziale Frage' published by Die Freie Bühne, Heft 15, 
14 Mai 1890. 
660. A reference to La Charte octroyée promulgated in 1814 by the French King 
Louis XVIII and granting a constitutional monarchy. In keeping with this 
charter, the top of the commercial and financial bourgeoisie were allowed 
to share power with the nobility. 
661. Engels means a Constitution endorsed by the Norwegian Representative 
Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814 after the model of the French Constitution of 
1791. 
662. 'Vaterlandslosen Gesellen' ('Fellows without Fatherland') - a description 
that Emperor William II gave to the Social Democrats. 
663. Danielson congratulated F. Engels on the victory of the German Social 
Democratic party at the election to the Reichstag on 20 February 1890 (see 
note 599). 
664. On 22 January 1890, N. Danielson sent the Statistical Yearbook for the 
Moscow Gubernia for 1889 to Engels and recommended that he read N. 
Chernenkov's articles in it, 'The Peasant Credit in the Moscow Gubernia in 
the Light of Correspondents' Reports' and 'Some Data on Peasant Public 
Loans in the Moscow Gubernia (According to Studies Carried out in 1876-
78)'. 
665. The reference is to the revolt of 1745-46 staged by supporters of the royal 
Stuart dynasty who demanded that the 'Young Pretender', Charles Edward 
Stuart, ascend to the throne. Regular government troops crushed the rebel­
lion. This set in rapid process the disintegration of the clan system in the 
Highlands, with land seizure assuming ever broader proportions.

666. Engels replies to F. Schlüter's letter of 3 June 1890 in which he said he had 
been appointed editor of the annual Pionier, Illustrierter Volks-Kalender 
published by the New Yorker Volkszeitung. Schlüter asked Engels for 
permission to publish in it the Marx biography which Engels wrote in 1877 
(see present edition, Vol. 24) and to supplement this biography by describ­
ing the last years of Marx's life. 
667. On 1 July 1890, an agreement was signed providing for the transfer of the 
administration of the Island of Heligoland in the North Sea from Britain to 
Germany in exchange for Zanzibar and other German colonies in Africa. 
668. Die Streusandbüchse (the sandbox) of the German Reich was the name 
given to the Brandenburger Mark with Berlin as the capital city. 
669. A reference to F Lassalle's proposal to Marx in January 1861 to publish a 
joint newspaper in Berlin; the preconditions made by Lassalle ruled out 
Marx's and Engels' participation in the project. About the reasons for the 
refusal of Marx and Engels to co-operate, see present edition Vol. 41 (Marx 
to Engels, 29 January 1861, Marx to Engels, 14 February 1861, Marx to 
Engels, 7 May 1861). 
670. In his letter of 13 June 1890, L. Kugelmann asked Engels to send him a 
Daily Telegraph with Kingstone's article on his meeting with Bismarck. 
671. Engels wrote these lines on a post card. Indicated on the reverse side was the 
address: Herrn Reichstagsabg. W. Liebknecht, Fürbringerstr.17, II, Berlin, 
Germany. 
672. Probably W. Liebknecht requested Engels to write a refutation to the news­
paper Justice over the publication in it, 21 June 1890, No. 336, Vol. VII, of 
a commentary under the heading 'Make a Note of This!'. In it, with refer­
ence to one of the Possibilist leaders, Paul Brousse, as a source, Liebknecht 
was reported to have made the following statement on behalf of the German 
Social Democratic Party: 'We are not revolutionaries', and he allegedly said 
that the German Social Democrats were pinning all hopes on propaganda, 
not on revolutionary actions. On 28 June  1890,  Justice, No. 337, Vol. VII, 
carried F. Gilles' letter to the editorial board 'German Social Democrats still 
Revolutionists'. Gilles made it clear that even though Liebknecht might 
have uttered the statement ascribed to him, he could in no way speak on 
behalf of the party which, at all its congresses, reasserted its loyalty to revo­
lutionary principles. On 2 August 1890, The People's Press published expla­
nations from Liebknecht concerning the assertions of Justice. 
673. In mid August 1890 Engels spent 4 weeks at Folkestone, a small resort near 
Dover. 
674. The first Congress of the German Social Democratic Party after the repeal 
of the Anti-Socialist Law (see note 52) took place at Halle on 12-18 October 
1890.  It was attended by 413 delegates. The congress endorsed the party 
rules and, at Liebknecht's suggestion, passed a decision on drafting a new 
Programme to be submitted at the next party congress at Erfurt and on

having this Draft Programme published three months before the congress 
for discussion at local party organisations and in the press. The Halle 
Congress likewise considered the issue of the party press and the party's 
attitude to strikes and boycotts. 
675. Engels means the annual tour of northern countries by Emperor William II; 
in 1890 it took place between 27 June and 28 July (see also F. Engels' letter 
to K. Kautsky of 18 September 1890, present edition, Vol. 49). 
676. Engels wrote this letter on a post card. He put down the following address 
on the back: F.A. Sorge Esq., Hoboken N.Y., US America which someone 
corrected to: Hoboken N.Y., US America in Mt. Desert, Maine. 
677. The owners of the gas enterprises of Leeds demanded that workers be hired 
for a term of 4 months without a right to participate in strike action during 
this period. The volume of work done in an  8-hour  day was supposed to be 
25 per cent higher than what had been performed before, that is, when the 
working day had been longer. These entrepreneurial conditions, amounting 
to an actual annihilation of the Gas Workers and General Labourers' Union 
and of the hard-won legal working hours, caused anger and counter-action 
amongst the working men. Early in July 1890 it came to clashes between 
strikers and blacklegs, the latter being supported by the police. The stub­
born resistance of the striking workers made the strike-breakers and troops 
retreat. The employers had to withdraw their demands. The exploit of one 
of the heroes or the Leeds strike, Will Thome, received high praise from 
Engels who presented him with a copy of the English edition of Volume I 
of Capital bearing the following dedication: 'To Will Thorne, the victor of 
the Leeds with fraternal greetings from Frederick Engels'. 
678. K. Kautsky took part in the work on the MS of volume IV of Capital, 
'Theories of Surplus Value' (see note 353).
