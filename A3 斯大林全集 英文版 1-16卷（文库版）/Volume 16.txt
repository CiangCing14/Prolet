## ORDER OF THE DAY, No. 5



Order of the Day, No. 5






J. V. Stalin
Order of the Day, No. 5
February 23, 1945



COMRADES, Red Army men and Red Navy men, sergeants, officers and generals! To-day we are celebrating the 27th Anniversary of the Red Army’s existence.


Created by the great Lenin to defend our Motherland from the attack of foreign invaders, and reared by the Bolshevik Party, the Red Army has traversed a glorious path in its development. It has fulfilled with credit its historic destiny and is rightfully the beloved child of the Soviet people. In the years of civil war the Red Army defended the young Soviet State from numerous enemies. In the great battles of the Patriotic War against German invasion the Red Army has saved the peoples of the Soviet Union from German-fascist slavery, upheld the freedom and independence of our Motherland, and helped the peoples of Europe to cast off the German yoke.


Now we are celebrating the 27th Anniversary of the Red Army in the midst of fresh historic victories over the enemy. The Red Army has not only freed its native land of the Hitlerite filth, but also hurled the enemy for many hundreds of kilometres back beyond those lines from which the Germans launched their bandit attack upon our country, carried the war into Germany’s territory and now, together with the armies of our Allies, is successfully completing the rout of the German-fascist army.


In January of this year the Red Army brought down upon the enemy a blow of unparalleled force along the entire front from the Baltic to the Carpathians. On a stretch of 1,200 kilometres (750 miles), it broke up the powerful defences of the Germans which they had been building for a number of years. In the course of the offensive the Red Army by its swift and skilful actions has hurled the enemy far back to the West. In stiff fighting the Soviet troops have advanced from the frontiers of East Prussia to the lower reaches of the Vistula—270 kilometres (175 miles), from the Vistula bridgehead south of Warsaw to the lower reaches of the Oder—570 kilometres (355 miles), and from the Sandomir bridgehead into the depth of German Silesia—480 kilometres (300 miles).


The first consequence of the successes of our winter offensive was that they thwarted the Germans’ winter offensive in the west, which aimed at the seizure of Belgium and Alsace, and enabled the armies of our Allies in their turn to launch an offensive against the Germans and thus link up their offensive operations in the west with the offensive operations of the Red Army in the east.


In forty days of the offensive in January-February, 1945, our troops have ejected the Germans from 300 towns, captured about 100 war plants, manufacturing tanks, aircraft, armaments and ammunition, occupied over 2,400 railway stations and seized a network of railways totalling over 15,000 kilometres (9,375 miles) in length. Within this short period Germany has lost over 350,000 officers and men in prisoners of war and not less than 800,000 in killed. During the same period the Red Army has destroyed or seized about 3,000 German aircraft, over 4,500 tanks and self-propelled guns and not less than 12,000 guns.


As a result, the Red Army has completely liberated Poland and a considerable part of the territory of Czechoslovakia, occupied Budapest and put out of the war Germany’s last ally in Europe, Hungary, captured the greater part of East Prussia and German Silesia and battled its way into Brandenburg, into Pomerania, to the approaches to Berlin.


The Hitlerites boasted that for more than a hundred years not a single enemy soldier had been within Germany’s borders, and that the German army had fought and would fight only on foreign soil. Now an end has been put to this German bragging.


Our winter offensive has shown that the Red Army finds more and more strength for the solution of ever more complex and difficult problems. Its glorious soldiers have learned to batter and annihilate the enemy in accordance with all the rules of modern military science. Our soldiers, inspired by the realization of their great mission of liberation, display miracles of heroism and selflessness, and ably combine gallantry and audacity in battle with full utilization of the power and strength of their weapons. The Red Army generals and officers in masterly manner combine massed blows of powerful equipment with skilful and swift manœuvre. In the fourth year of the war the Red Army has grown stronger and mightier than ever before, its combat equipment has become still more perfect and its fighting mastery many times higher.


Comrades, Red Army men and Red Navy men, sergeants, officers and generals!


Complete victory over the Germans is now already near. But victory never comes of itself—it is won in hard battles and in persistent labour. The doomed enemy hurls his last forces into action, resists desperately in order to escape stern retribution. He grasps and will grasp at the most extreme and base means of struggle. Therefore it should be borne in mind that the nearer our victory, the higher must be our vigilance and the heavier must be our blows at the enemy.


On behalf of the Soviet Government and our glorious Bolshevik Party, I greet and congratulate you upon the 27th Anniversary of the Red Army!


To mark the great victories achieved by the armed forces of the Soviet State in the course of the past year, I order:


To-day, February 23, on the day of the 27th Anniversary of the Red Army, at 20.00 hours (Moscow time) a salute of 20 artillery salvoes shall be fired in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Petrozavodsk, Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, Kishinev, Tbilisi, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, Odessa and Lvov.


Long live our glorious Red Army Long live our victorious Navy!


Long live our mighty Soviet Motherland!


Eternal glory to the heroes who fell in the struggle for the freedom and independence of our Motherland!


Death to the German invaders!

## SPEECH ON THE TREATY WITH POLAND



Speech of April 21, 1945, on the Occasion of the Signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration bewteen the U.S.S.R. and the Polish Republic






J. V. Stalin
Speech of April 21, 1945, on the Occasion of the Signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration bewteen the U.S.S.R. and the Polish Republic
April 21, 1945



MR. PRESIDENT, Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!


I believe that the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-war Collaboration between the Soviet Union and Poland which we have just signed is of great, historic importance.


The importance of this Treaty consists in the first place in that it signifies the radical turn of relations between the Soviet Union and Poland towards alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the course of the present liberation struggle against Germany and which is now being formally consummated in this Treaty.


It is known that relations between our countries in the course of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrangement, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open military conflicts. Such relations weakened both our countries and strengthened German imperialism.


The importance of the present Treaty consists in that it puts an end to these old relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and Poland.


In the course of the last two World Wars the Germans succeeded in making use of the territory of Poland as a corridor for invasion of the East and as a springboard for attack on the Soviet Union. This became possible because at that time there were no friendly allied relations between our countries. The former rulers of Poland did not want to have relations of alliance with the Soviet Union. They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and the Soviet Union. And of course they played themselves into trouble. . . . Poland was occupied, her independence abolished, and as a result of this whole ruinous policy German troops were enabled to appear at the gates of Moscow.


The importance of the present Treaty consists in that it puts an end to the old and ruinous policy of playing about between Germany and the Soviet Union, and replaces it by a policy of alliance and friendship between Poland and her Eastern neighbour.


Such is the historic importance of the Treaty between Poland and the Soviet Union on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration which we have just signed.


No wonder, therefore, that the peoples of our countries impatiently await the signing of this Treaty. They feel that this Treaty is a pledge of the independence of new, democratic Poland, a pledge of her might and her prosperity.


But matters are not confined to that. The present Treaty has also great international significance.As long as there existed no alliance between our countries Germany was able to take advantage of the absence of a united front between us, she could oppose Poland to the Soviet Union and vice versa, and thus beat them one at a time. Things changed radically after the alliance between our countries took shape. Now it is no longer possible to oppose our countries to each other. Now there exists a united front between our countries from the Baltic to the Carpathians against the common enemy, against German imperialism. Now one may confidently say that German aggression is besieged from the East. Undoubtedly if this barrier in the East is supplemented by a barrier in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries and our Allies in the West, one may safely say that German aggression will be curbed, and that it will not be easy for it to run loose.


No wonder, therefore, that the freedom-loving nations, and in the first place the Slav nations, impatiently await the conclusion of this Treaty, for they see that this Treaty signifies a strengthening of the united front of the United Nations against the common enemy in Europe.


Therefore, I do not doubt that our Allies in the West will welcome this Treaty.


May free, independent, democratic Poland live and prosper! 


May her Eastern neighbour—our Soviet Union—live and prosper! 


Long live the alliance and friendship between our countries!

The troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front and our Allied British and American troops, striking from the East and West, severed the front of the German troops, and on April 25, at 13.30 ho-ours, effected a junction in the middle of Germany, in the region of Torgau. As a result, the German troops located in North Germany have been cut off from the German troops in the southern regions of Germany.
To mark this victory, and in honour of this historic event, today, April 27, at 19.00 hours, the capital of of our country, Moscow, will, on behalf of our country, salute the valiant troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front and our Allied British and  American  troops  with  24  artillery salvoes, fired from 324 guns.

Message Broadcast on the Evening of April 27, 1945, to the Officers and Men of the Red Army and of the Armies of the Allies on the Occasion of their Linking up on German Soil
April 27, 1945



IN the name of the Soviet Government, I address you, commanders and men of the Red Army, and of the armies of our Allies.


The victorious armies of the Allied Powers, waging a war of liberation in Europe, have routed the German troops and linked up on the territory of Germany.


Our task and our duty are to complete the destruction of the enemy, to force him to lay down his arms and surrender unconditionally. The Red Army will fulfil to the end this task and this duty to our people and to all freedom-loving peoples.


I greet the valorous troops of our Allies, which are now standing on the territory of Germany shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet troops, and which are full of determination to carry out their duty to the end.

I congratulate the fighting organ of Soviet youth, the paper “Komsomolskaya Pravda”, on her twenty years.
During the years of peaceful construction and throughout the days of the Great Patriotic War, “Komsomolskaya Pravda” has educated the Soviet youth in the spirit of unreserved service to the Motherland.
I am sure that in the future, the “Komsomolskaya Pravda” is going to successfully accomplish educational tasks towards the next generation in the devoted spirit to the Leninist Party, to help youth to achieve the realizations of science and culture, to strengthen the forces of the young patriots for battle, with a view to the ultimate flourishing of our great Motherland!

## ORDER OF THE DAY, No. 20



Order of the Day, No. 20






J. V. Stalin
Order of the Day, No. 20
May 1, 1945



COMRADES, Red Army men and Red Navy men, sergeants and petty officers, officers of the Army and Navy, generals and admirals! 


Working people of the Soviet Union!


To-day our country is celebrating the First of May—the international festival of the working people.


This year, the peoples of our Motherland are celebrating May Day under conditions of the victorious termination of the Great Patriotic War.


The hard times when the Red Army fought back the enemy troops at Moscow and Leningrad, at Grozny and Stalingrad, are gone—never to return. Now our victorious troops are battering the enemy’s armed forces in the centre of Germany, far beyond Berlin, on the River Elbe.


Within a short time Poland, Hungary, the greater part of Czechoslovakia, a considerable part of Austria, and her capital Vienna, have been liberated.


At the same time the Red Army has captured East Prussia, home of German imperialism, Pomerania, the greater part of Brandenburg and the main districts of Germany’s capital Berlin, having hoisted the banner of victory over Berlin.


As a result of these offensive battles fought by the Red Army, within three to four months the Germans have lost over 800,000 officers and men in prisoners and about one million in killed. During the same period the Red Army troops have captured or destroyed up to 6,000 enemy aircraft, up to 12,000 tanks and self-propelled guns, over 23,000 field guns and enormous quantities of other armaments and equipment.


It should be noted that in these battles Polish, Yugoslav, Czechoslovak, Bulgarian and Rumanian divisions successfully advanced against the common enemy side by side with the Red Army.


As a result of the Red Army’s shattering blows, the German Command was compelled to transfer dozens of divisions to the Soviet-German Front, baring whole sectors on other fronts. This circumstance helped the forces of our Allies to develop their successful offensive in the West. Thus by simultaneous blows at the German troops from East and West, the troops of the Allies and the Red Army were able to cut the German forces into two isolated parts and to effect a junction of our troops and the Allied troops in a united front.


There can be no doubt that this circumstance means the end of Hitlerite Germany.


The days of Hitlerite Germany are numbered. More than half of her territory is occupied by the Red Army and by the troops of our Allies. Germany has lost the most important, vital districts. The industry remaining in the Hitlerites’ hands cannot supply the German army with sufficient, quantities of armaments, ammunition and fuel. The man-power reserves of the German army are depleted. Germany is completely isolated and stands alone, if her ally Japan is not counted. In search of a way out from their hopeless plight, the Hitlerite adventurers resort to all kinds of tricks, down to flirting with the Allies, in an effort to cause dissension in the Allied camp. These fresh knavish tricks of the Hitlerites are doomed to utter failure. They can only accelerate the disintegration of the German troops.


Mendacious fascist propaganda intimidates the German population by absurd tales, alleging that the Armies of the United Nations wish to exterminate the German people. The United Nations do not set themselves the task of destroying the German people. The United Nations will destroy fascism and German militarism, will severely punish war criminals, and will compel the Germans to compensate damage they have caused to other countries. But the United Nations do not molest and will not molest Germany’s civilian population if it honestly fulfils the demands of the Allied military authorities.


The brilliant victories won by the Soviet troops in the Great Patriotic War have demonstrated the colossal might of the Red Army and its high military skill. In the progress of the war our Motherland has come to possess a first-rate regular army, capable of upholding the great Socialist achievements of our people and of securing the State interests of the Soviet Union.


Despite the fact that the Soviet Union has for nearly four years been waging war on an unparalleled scale demanding colossal expenditures, our Socialist economic system is gaining strength and developing, while the economy of the liberated regions, plundered and ruined by the German invaders, is successfully and swiftly reviving. This is the result of the heroic efforts of the workers and collective farmers, of the Soviet intellectuals, of the women and the youth of our country, inspired and guided by the great Bolshevik Party.


The world war unleashed by the German imperialists is drawing to a close. The collapse of Hitlerite Germany is a matter of the nearest future. The Hitlerite ringleaders, who imagined themselves rulers of the world, have found themselves ruined. The mortally wounded fascist beast is breathing its last. One thing is now rewired—to deal the death-blow to the fascist beast.


Fighting men of the Red Army and Navy!


The last storming of the Hitlerite lair is on. Set new examples of military skill and gallantry in the concluding battles. Smite the enemy harder, skilfully break up his defence, pursue and surround the German invaders, give them no respite until they cease resistance.


Beyond the border of our native land be especially vigilant!


Uphold the honour and dignity of the Soviet soldier as heretofore!


Working people of the Soviet Union!


Increase your all-round assistance to the front by persistent and indefatigable work. Swiftly heal the wounds inflicted on our country by the war, raise still higher the might of our Soviet State!


Comrades, Red Army men and Red Navy men, sergeants and petty officers, officers of the Army and Navy, generals and admirals! 


Working people of the Soviet Union!


On behalf of the Soviet’ Government and of our Bolshevik Party, I greet and congratulate you upon the First of May.


in honour of the historic victories of the Red Army at the front and of the great achievements of the workers, collective farmers and intellectuals in the rear, to mark the international festival of the working people, I hereby order:


To-day, on May 1, a salute of 20 artillery salvoes shall be fired in the capitals of Union Republics—Moscow, Kiev, Minsk, Baku, Tbilisi, Erevan, Ashkabad, Tashkent, Stalinabad, Alma-Ata, Frunze, Petrozavodsk, Kishinev, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn—as well as in the hero-cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol and Odessa.


Long live our mighty Soviet Motherland!


Long live the great Soviet people, the people victorious!


Long live the victorious Red Army and Navy!


Eternal glory to the heroes who fell in the battles for the freedom and independence of our Motherland!


Forward to the final rout of Hitlerite Germany!

## VICTORY SPEECH



Victory Speech of 9 May 1945






J. V. Stalin
Victory SpeechA
Broadcast from Moscow at 20.00 hours (Moscow time) on May 9, 1945
May 9, 1945



Marshal Josef Stalin
COMRADES! Men and women compatriots!


The great day of victory over Germany has come. Fascist Germany, forced to her knees by the Red Army and the troops of our Allies, has acknowledged herself defeated and declared unconditional surrender.


On May 7 the preliminary protocol on surrender was signed in the city of Rheims. On May 8 representatives of the German High Command, in the presence of representatives of the Supreme Command of the Allied troops and the Supreme Command of the Soviet Troops, signed in Berlin the final act of surrender, the execution of which began at 24.00 hours on May 8.


Being aware of the wolfish habits of the German ringleaders, who regard treaties and agreements as empty scraps of paper, we have no reason to trust their words. However, this morning, in pursuance of the act of surrender, the German troops began to lay down their arms and surrender to our troops en masse. This is no longer an empty scrap of paper. This is actual surrender of Germany’s armed forces. True, one group of German troops in the area of Czechoslovakia is still evading surrender. But I trust that the Red Army will be able to bring it to its senses.


Now we can state with full justification that the historic day of the final defeat of Germany, the day of the great victory of our people over German imperialism has come.


The great sacrifices we made in the name of the freedom and independence of our Motherland, the incalculable privations and sufferings experienced by our people in the course of the war, the intense work in the rear and at the front, placed on the altar of the Motherland, have not been in vain, and have been crowned by complete victory over the enemy. The age-long struggle of the Slav peoples for their existence and their independence has ended in victory over the German invaders and German tyranny.


Henceforth the great banner of the freedom of the peoples and peace among peoples will fly over Europe.


Three years ago Hitler declared for all to hear that his aims included the dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the wresting from it of the Caucasus, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic lands and other areas. He declared bluntly: “We will destroy Russia so that she will never be able to rise again.” This was three years ago. However, Hitler’s crazy ideas were not fated to come true—the progress of the war scattered them to the winds. In actual fact the direct opposite of the Hitlerites’ ravings has taken place. Germany is utterly defeated. The German troops are surrendering. The Soviet Union is celebrating Victory, although it does not intend either to dismember or to destroy Germany.


Comrades! The Great Patriotic War has ended in our complete victory. The period of war in Europe is over. The period of peaceful development has begun.


I congratulate you upon victory, my dear men and women compatriots!


Glory to our heroic Red Army, which upheld the independence of our Motherland and won victory over the enemy!


Glory to our great people, the people victorious!


Eternal glory to the heroes who fell in the struggle against the enemy and gave their lives for the freedom and happiness of our people!

## REPLY CONCERNING THE POLISH DIVERSIONISTS



Reply to "The Times" Moscow Correspondent's Question Concerning the 16 Arrested Polish Diversionists






J. V. Stalin
Reply to “The Times” Moscow Correspondent’s Question Concerning the 16 Arrested Polish Diversionists
May 18, 1945


Letter from Mr. Ralph Parker, The Times correspondent in Moscow, to the Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars of the U.S.S.R., J. V. Stalin:


THE foreign Press has printed a report that several Poles who, according to the recent Tass statement, had been arrested on the charge of the organization and carrying out of diversionist actions in the rear of the Red Army, in reality were members of a delegation invited to conduct negotiations with the Soviet authorities. It has also been reported that this group of Poles includes democratic leaders whose opinion on the formation of the future Polish Government would have made a valuable contribution to the formation of such a Government. It has also been reported that by the arrest of these Poles the Soviet Government undermines confidence in the measures adopted in the Crimea, and hinders the formation of a new Polish Provisional Government.


Would you care to make a statement on this question in order to clarify public opinion, which is interested in this question?


Yours respectfully,
Ralph Parker
Moscow
May 11, 1945

J. V. Stalin addressed the following reply to Mr. Parker:


I HAVE somewhat delayed my answer, but this is understandable if one keeps in mind how busy I am.


1. The arrest of the sixteen Poles in Poland headed by the well-known diversionist General Okulicki has no connection with the question of the reconstruction of the Polish Provisional Government. These “gentlemen” were arrested in accordance with the law protecting the Red Army rear from diversionists—a law similar to the British Defence of the Realm Act. The arrests were carried out by Soviet military authorities in accordance with an agreement concluded between the Polish Provisional Government and the Soviet Military Command.


2. It is untrue that the arrested Poles were invited for negotiations with the Soviet authorities. The Soviet authorities do not and will not conduct negotiations with those who break the law on the protection of the Red Army rear.


3. As far as the question of the reorganization of the Polish Provisional Government itself is concerned, it can only be solved on the basis of the Crimea decisions, because no deviation from these decisions can be permitted.


4. I think the Polish question can be solved by agreement between the Allies only if the following elementary conditions are observed:  


a.—if in the reconstruction of the Polish Provisional Government the latter is recognized as the basic core of the future Polish Government of National Unity, similar to the case of Yugoslavia, where the National Liberation Committee was recognized as the basic core of the United Yugoslav Government;


b.—if as a result of the reconstruction a Government is created in Poland which will pursue a policy of friendship with the Soviet Union, and not the policy of the “cordon sanitaire” against the Soviet Union;


c.—if the question of the reconstruction of the Polish Govel’hment is resolved together with the Poles who now have ties with the Polish people, and not without them.


Yours respectfully,
J. Stalin

## TOAST TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE



Toast to the Russian People at a Reception in Honour of Red Army Commanders Given by the Soviet Government in the Kremlin on Thursday, May 24, 1945






J. V. Stalin
Toast to the Russian People at a Reception in Honour of Red Army Commanders Given by the Soviet Government in the Kremlin on Thursday, May 24, 1945
May 24, 1945



COMRADES! Permit me to propose one more, last toast.


I should like to propose a toast to the health of our Soviet people, and in the first place, the Russian people. (Loud and prolonged applause and shouts of “Hurrah.”)


I drink in the first place to the health of the Russian people because it is the most outstanding nation of all the nations forming the Soviet Union.


I propose a toast to the health of the Russian people because it has won in this war universal recognition as the leading force of the Soviet Union among all the peoples of our country.


I propose a toast to the health of the Russian people not only because it is the leading people, but also because it possesses a clear mind, a staunch character, and patience.


Our Government made not a few errors, we experienced at moments a desperate situation in 1941-1942, when our Army was retreating, abandoning our own villages and towns of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia, the Leningrad Region, the Baltic area and the Karelo-Finnish Republic, abandoning them because there was no other way out.A different people could have said to the Government: “You have failed to justify our expectations. Go away. We shall install another government which will conclude peace with Germany and assure us a quiet life.” The Russian people, however, did not take this path because it trusted the correctness of the policy of its Government, and it made sacrifices to ensure the rout of Germany. This confidence of the Russian people in the Soviet Government proved to be that decisive force which ensured the historic victory over the enemy of humanity—over fascism.


Thanks to it, to the Russian people, for this confidence!


To the health of the Russian people! (Loud and prolonged applause.)

The French regiment, Normandie-Niemen, returns to its country equipped, that is to say, with its aeroplanes fully equipped, and for its itinerary will follow the Elbe in a westerly direction.
I thought it essential to bestow on the regiment the materials which it has courageously utilized, and with much success, on the oriental front.  May these materials be a modest present from the Soviet Union aviation to France, and the symbol of the friendship between our two peoples.
I beg you to accept my thanks for the work that this regiment has done on the front in the battle against the German armies.

Do not imagine that I am going to tell you anything extraordinary. The toast that I wish to raise is as simple as it is informal. I would like to drink to the health of those   on    the lower echelons whose  conditions  are  little envied,  to those who are considered as the “screws” of the immense machine of the government but without whom, all of us marshals or commanding officers of the fronts or armies wouldn’t be worth, if I may so express it, a jot. Because it requires only for one screw to disappear and all is finished, r drink to the health of simple folk, ordinary and modest, the “screws” which ensure the functioning of our enormous state machine in all its aspects: science, economy, war. They are numerous and their name is legion because they comprise dozens of millions. These are modest people, no-one writes about them,their situation is mediocre and their status is low, but these people support us as the base supports the summit.

Isued by Marshal Stalin and addressed to the troops of the Red Army and the Red Navy



During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people against fascist Germany,our Red Navy has been a faithful helper of the Red Army.
In the war against the U.S.S.R.,fascist Germany, relying on the suddenness of their attack and the strength of their well practised army, tried to beat our army and our navy in a shorter time. lt was by combining her army with her air-force and her navy, that Germany wanted to realise her domination over the seas.
It is well known that the strategy of the Germans on land and at sea went hopelessly wrong. The Red Army, together with our Allies, routed the Hitlerites and forced them to capitulate.
In both the defensive and offensive fighting of our Red Army, our Navy was a dependable cover for the flanks of our Red Army pushing through to the sea,blocking the enemy’s merchant shipping and strategically important navigation routes, securing the uninterrupted functioning of our lines of communication. The fighting action of the Soviet Navy is illustrated through its self-sacrificing steadfastness and valour, its intense combat activity and military skill. The submarine men, the sailors, the naval airmen, artillerymen and infantry have taken over and further developed everything that was so valuable in the hun~ dreds of years of tradition of the Russian Navy.
The Soviet sailors have in the four years of war, on the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the Barents Sea, on the Voly, , the Danube a’nd the Dnieper, added new pages to the glorious history of the Russian Navy. The Navy has more than fulfilled its duty to the Soviet Motherland.
Comrades sailors, commanders and officers!
The Soviet people want to see their Navy even stronger and more powerful.Our people will produce more warships and bases for the Navy. The task of the Navy is to educate inexperienced marine cadres, to perfect them, to help them to make the fighting experience of the Patriotic War, and maritime, their own, and to increase even more the discipline and organization within their ranks.
I congratulate you on this Day of the Red Navy of the U.S.S.R.
Long live the Red Navy of the U.S.S.R. and its heroic men.

Thank you for your greetings and for the important support you gave the Soviet Union regarding the defeat of the Japanese aggressors. The surrender of Japan together with Germany has terminated the second World War, and proves that humanity is indebted to the close military co-operation of the Allies for the defeat of the . aggressors in the West and in the East. This victory is of historic and global significance in as much as it is a great, enlightened forward step in the progressive development of humanity.
I express the conviction that the friendship and co-operation of our countries with all freedom-loving nations will serve the cause of universal peace and the prosperity of all peoples.

In the Great War of the Soviet Motherland against fascist Germany, our airforce fulfilled their task with pride.
The mighty falcon of our Motherland smashed the famous German airforce in a bitter battle in the skies, through which the action of the Red Army liberated the entire population from the (air) bombardments of the enemy.
Together with the entire Red Army, they led a deadly fight against the enemy and smashed its soldiers and its great war machines. The finely detailed operations of our heroic airforce helped the land army continuously in their successes, all of which led to the final capitulation of the enemy.
The Soviet pilots played no small part in the struggle for the liberation and independence of our Motherland. With their single-mindedness and extraordinary determination, they were courageous heroes. They have written more glorious pages in the history of our Motherland.
The victorious Soviet people are justly proud of the struggle they put up.
In the course of the war, it is thanks to the ceaseless efforts of the workers, both men and women, the engineers, the research and talents of all who worked on the construction of the aeroplanes in the Soviet Union, that made it possible for our airforce to organize,with thousands of excellent fighter planes, I he smashing of our enemy.
Comrade pilots, navigation officers and ground workers, radio and motor, weapon maintainors, mechanics, technicians and engineers,officers and  generals,  workers,  administration  and construction, in the aeroplane industry!
1 greet you and congratulate you on this celebration day of the airforce! To celebrate this day of the airforce, and to honour our brave pilots, I order:
Today, August 19, at 20.00 hours, in the capital city of our Motherland, in Moscow, in the name of our homeland, our heroic airforce shall be saluted with 20 artillery shots from 224 canons.

Comrades!  Fellow countrymen and countrywomen!
Today, September 2, political and military representatives of Japan signed an act of unconditional surrender. Utterly defeated on sea and land, and completely surrounded by the armed forces of the United Nations, Japan has admitted defeat and has laid down her arms.
Two hotbeds of world fascism and world aggression had been formed on the eve of the present World War: Germany in the West and Japan in the East. It was they who unleashed the Second World War. It was they who brought mankind and civilization to the brink of doom. The hotbed of world aggression in the West was destroyed  four  months  ago  and,  as a  result,  Uermany was forced to capitulate. Four months later the hotbed of aggression in the East was destroyed and as a res1', Japan, Germany's principal ally, was also compelled to sign an act of capitulation.
This signifies the end of the Second World War.
Now we can say that the conditions necessary for peace all over the world have been gained.
It must be observed that the Japanese aggressors inflicted damage not only on our Allies - China, the U.S.A. and Great Britain. They also inflicted extremely grave damage on our country. That is why we have a seperate account to settle with Japan.
Japan commenced her aggression against our country as far back as 1904,during the Russo -Japanese War. As we know, in February 1904, when negotiations between Japan and Russia were still proceeding, Japan, taking advantage of the weakness of the tsarist government, suddenly and perfidiously, without declaring war, fell upon our country and attacked the Russian fleet in the region of Port Arthur with the object of putting a number of Russian warships out of action and thereby creating an advantageous position for her fleet. She did, indeed, put out of action three Russian first-class warships. It is characteristic that 37 years later Japan played exactly the same perfidious trick against the United States when, in 1941, she attacked the United States naval  base in Pearl  Harbour and put  a number of American battleships out of action. As we know, in the war against Japan, Russia was defeated. Japan took advantage of the defeat of tsarist Russia to seize from Russia the southern part of Sakhalin and establish herself on the Kuril Islands, thereby putting the lock on all our country's outlets to the ocean in the East, which meant also all outlets to the ports of Sovfet Kamchatka and Soviet Chukotka. It was obvious that Japan was aiming to deprive Russia of the whole of her Far East.
But this does not exhaust the list of Japan's aggressive operations against our country. In 1918, after the Soviet system was established in our country, Japan, taking advantage of the hostility then displayed towards the Land of the Soviets by Great Britain, France and the United States, and leaning upon them, again attacked our country, occupied the Far East and for four years tormented our people and looted the Soviet Far East.
Nor is this all. In 1938 Japan attacked our country again, in the region of Lake Hasan, near Vladivostok, with the object of surrounding Vladivostok; and in the following year Japan repeated her attack in another place, in the region of the Mongolian   People's   Republic,   near   Khalkin-gol, with the object of breaking into Soviet territory, severing our Siberian Railway and cutting off the Far East from Russia.
True, Japan's attacks in the regions of Hasan and Khalkin-gol were liquidated by the Soviet troops, to the extreme humiliation of the Japanese. Japanese military intervention in 1918-1922 was liquidated with equal success and Japanese invaders were expelled from our Far Eastern regions. But the defeat of the Russian troops in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War left bitter memories in the minds of our people. It lay like a black stain on our country. Our people believed in and waited for the day when Japan would be defeated and the stain would be wiped out. We of the older generation waited for this day for forty years, and now this day has arrived. Today Japan admitted defeat and signed an act of unconditional surrender.
This means that the southern part of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands revert to the Soviet Union and henceforth will serve not as a barrier between the Soviet Union and the ocean and as a base for Japanese attack upon our Far East but as a direct means of communication between the Soviet Union and the ocean and a base for the defence of our country against Japanese aggression.
Our Soviet people spared neither strength nor labour for the sake of victory.We experienced extremely hard years. But now everyone of us can say: We have won. Henceforth we can regard our country as being free from the menace of German invasion in the West and of Japanese invasion in the East. The long awaited peace for the peoples of all the world has come.

I congratulate you, my dear fellow countrymen and country-women, on this great victory, on   the  successful   termination of  the  war,  and on- the ushering in of peace all over the world!
Glory to the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States of America, China and Great Britain which achieved victory over Japan!
Glory to our Far Eastern troops and our Pacific Fleet, which upheld the honour and dignity of our country!
Glory to our great people, the victorious people!
Eternal glory to the heroes who fell fighting for the honour and victory of our country! May our country flourish and prosper!

## SPEECH AT AN ELECTION MEETING



Origin and Character of the Second World War






J. V. Stalin
Origin and Character of the Second World War
February 9, 1946


Source: For Peaceful Coexistence: Post War Interviews
Publisher: International Publishers, New York, 1951
Transcription/Markup: Brian Reid


[From a speech to the voters of his district during the elections to the Supreme Soviet, February 9, 1946]



It would be wrong to think that the Second World War was a casual occurrence or the result of mistakes of any particular statesmen, though mistakes undoubtedly were made. Actually, the war was the inevitable result of the development of world economic and political forces on the basis of modern monopoly capitalism. Marxists have declared more than once that the capitalist system of world economy harbors elements of general’s crises and armed conflicts and that, hence, the development of capitalism in our time proceeds not in the form of smooth, and even progress but through crises and military catastrophe.


The fact is that the unevenness of development of the capitalist countries usually leads in time to violent disturbance of equilibrium in the world system of capitalism. That group of capitalist countries which considers itself worse provided than others with raw materials and markets usually makes attempts to alter the situation and to repartition the “spheres of influence” in its favor by armed force. The result is a splitting of the capitalist world into two hostile camps and war between them.


Perhaps military catastrophes might be avoided if it were possible for raw materials and markets to be periodically redistributed among the various countries in accordance with their economic importance, by agreement and peaceable settlement. But that is impossible to do under present capitalist conditions of the development of world economy.


Thus the First World War (1914-18) was the result of the first crisis of the capitalist system of world economy, and the Second World War (1939-45) was the result of a second crisis.


That does not mean of course that the Second World War is a copy of the first. On the contrary, the Second World War differs materially from the first in character. It must be borne in mind that before attacking the Allied countries the principal fascist states—Germany, Japan, and Italy—destroyed the last vestiges of bourgeois-democratic liberties at home, established a brutal terrorist regime in their own countries, rode roughshod over the principles of sovereignty and free development of small countries, proclaimed a policy of seizure of alien territories as their own policy, and declared for all to hear that they were out for world domination and the establishment of a fascist regime throughout the world.


Moreover, by the seizure of Czechoslovakia and of the central areas of China, the Axis states showed that they were prepared to carry out their threat of enslaving all freedom-loving nations. In view of this, unlike the First World War, the Second World War against the Axis states from the very outset assumed the character of an anti-fascist war, a war of liberation, one aim of which was also the restoration of democratic liberties. The entry of the Soviet Union into the war against the Axis states could only enhance, and indeed did enhance, the anti-fascist and liberation character of the Second World War.


It was on this basis that the anti-fascist coalition of the Soviet Union, the United States of America, Great Britain, and other freedom-loving states came into being—a coalition which subsequently played a decisive part in defeating the armed forces of the Axis states.


That is how matters stand as regards the origin and character of the Second World War.

Dear Comrade Rasin,
I have received your letter of 30 January on Clausewitz and your short thesis on war and the art of war.
1. You ask if Lenin's standpoint on the judgement of Clausewitz is no longer valid.
In my opinion the question is wrongly put.
By putting the question in such a way one could believe that Lenin had analyzed the science of war and the works of Clausewitz, judged them from a military viewpoint, and had left us a number of guidelines on military questions. Putting the question in such a way is wrong because there are no such "Theses" of Lenin on Clausewitz's teachings on the art of war.
Unlike Engels, Lenin did not believe himself to be an expert on military matters, - neither before the October Revolution, nor in the period up to the end of the Civil War.
During the Civil War, Lenin abjured us young comrades on the Central Committee to study the art of war thoroughly. He unhesitatingly declared that it was too late for him to become a military expert. This explains why Lenin, in his judgement on Clausewitz and his remarks on Clausewitz's works, does not touch upon solely military aspects such as questions of military strategy and tactics and their relation to each other, the relation between attack and retreat, defence and counter-offensive and so on.
What was Lenin's interest in Clausewitz and why did he acknowledge him?
Lenin acknowleged Clausewitz who was not a Marxist, and who was recognized as an authority in the field of military theory because in his works he confirmed the known Marxist theory that there is a direct relation between war and politics, that politics can engender war and that war is the continuation of politics by force. Here, Lenin needed Clausewitz to prove that Plekhanov, Kautsky and others had fallen once more into social chauvinism and social imperialism. He further acknowledged Clausewitz in that he confirmed the Marxist viewpoint in his works that under certain unfavourable conditions, - retreat is as justifiable a military action as is attack. Lenin needed Clausewitz  to disprove the theory of the "left" Communists who denied that retreat could be a justifiable military action.
In this way, not as a military expert, but as a politician, Lenin used the works of Clausewitz, and was mainly interested in those questions in the works of Clausewitz which showed the relation between war and politics.
Thus, as successors of Lenin, there are no restrictions on  us  in  the  criticism  of  the   Military doctrine of Clausewitz, as there are no remarks of Lenin that could hinder us in our free criticism.
Thus, your judgement, on the article of Comrade Meshtsherjakov (in "Wojennaja Mysl," No. 6/7, 1945), which criticises the military doctrine of Clausewitz, regarding it as a "Revision" of  Lenin's  judgement  is completely   unjustified.
2.  Do we have reason at all to criticise the   military   doctrine  of  Clausewitz?   Yes,   we have. In the interests of our cause and the modern science of war, we are obliged not only to criticise Clausewitz,  but also Moltke, Sclieffen, Ludendorff,  Keitel and other exponents of German   military   ideology.   During   the   last   thirty years  Germany  has  twice  forced  a bloody  war on the rest of the world and twice has suffered defeat.   Was   this   accidental?  Of   course   not. Does  this  not  mean  that not only Germany as a whole,  but also its military ideology has not stood  the test? Obviously. It is well known that the  military  of  the whole  world,  also our Russian  military,  looked up to the, German military authorities. Is it not time to put an end to this undeserved respect? Absolutely. So, this can only be done by criticism, especially from our side, especially from the side of those who have won the victory over Germany.
Concerning Clausewitz, as an authority in the field of military authority, he is of course out of date. On the whole, Clausewitz was a representative of the time of manufacture in war, but now we are in the machine age of war. Undoubtedly the machine age of war requires new military ideologies. Thus, it would be ridiculous to follow the teachings of Clausewitz today. One cannot make progress and further science without a critical analysis of the antiquated theories of well known authorities. This applies not only to the authorities in war theory but also to the Marxist classics. Engels once said of the Russian Commanders of 1812, that Gen. Barclay de Tolley was the only one of any relevance. Engels was of course wrong, as Kut-usov was of greater importance by far. Nevertheless there are people in our time who did not hesitate to defend this wrong judgement of Engels.
In our criticism we must not be guided by single remarks and judgements from the classics, but must be guided by Lenin's well known guideline :
"We do not regard the theory of Marx as something final and untouchable; on the contrary, we are convinced that it has laid the foundations  of  that   science   that   the  Socialists must develop in every direction if they do not want to fall bad behind the times. We are of the opinion that the Russian Socialists must find their own interpretation of Marxism, as this theory gives only general guidelines, the application of which in detail is different in England than in France; in France, different than in Germany; in Germany, different than in Russia." (Lenin Works, Vol. 4. Moscow 1946. Pp 191-192. Russian Ed.)
Such an attitude is for us even more necessary concerning the authorities of war theory.
3. Concerning your short thesis on war and the art of war, I have to restrict myself to general remarks because of their surface character. The thesis contains too much philosophy and abstract statements. The terminology taken from Clausewitz, talking of the grammar and logic of war hurts ones ears. The question of the factional character of war theory is primitively posed. The hymns of praise to Stalin also pain the ears, it hurts to read them. Also, the chapter on counter-offensive (not to be confused with counter-attack) is missing. I am talking of the counter-offensive after a successful but indecisive enemy offensive, during which the defenders assemble their forces to turn to a counter-offensive and strike a decisive blow to the en-, emy and inflict defeat upon him. 1 am of the opinion that a well organized counter-offensive is a very interesting method of offensive. You, as an historian should be interested in this. The old  Parthens were already  acquainted with such a counter-offensive when they lured the Roman Commander Crassus and his army into the interior of their country and, turning to counter-offensive, destroyed him and his troops. Our brilliant Commander, Kutusov, executed this when he destroyed Napoleon and his army by a well prepared counter-offensive.

Comrades soldiers and sailors of the Red Army and Red Navy, non-commissioned officers, officers and generals!
Today we are celebrating the twenty-eighth anniversary of the existence of the Red Army. The Red Army commemorates its twenty-eighth anniversary in the glow of the glorious victory over the German and Japanese imperialists. Engaged in a prolonged and arduous war, the Fled Army has emerged as a first-class army of the highest morale and fighting force, equipped with modern armaments and cadres of great experience, tempered by battle. In the war against the fascist invaders the Red Army has shown its high quality, and it has shown that it is able to defend the interests of the Soviet state effectively, faithfully and staunchly.
Our soldiers, officers and generals have justified the confidence of the people and have shown their great devotion towards our Motherland. The Red Army has proved to the Soviet, people that they can have confidence in it. The people of our country have great trust in their army and its victories, and will keep the sacred memory of their heroes who fell in the battles for the Motherland.
The remarkable victories of the Red Army are explained, above all, by the fact that it is a truly popular army that defends the interests of its people. The Soviet people love their army ardently, and are a constant source of its reinforcement and of its strength. This has been shown especially in the time of the Great Patriotic War. All our people have worked unhesitatingly, day and night, for victory. Without this work, without this self-sacrificing of the workers, peasants and intellectuals, without their material and moral support, the Red Army would not have defeated the enemy.
The victories of the Red Army are also explained by the fact that it was led and educated by the Communist Party. Furthermore, the behests of the great Lenin helped the Soviet people, under the guidance of the Communist Party, to transform our country from a backward land to a land of progress, from an agrarian to an industrial country. On this basis was founded all the material possibilities for the victorious struggle of the Red Army against its enemies. During the Great Patriotic War, the Communist Party united all the countries of the Soviet Union into a single military camp, and has orientated all the efforts of the people and the army towards a single aim - the destruction of the enemy. The Communist Party has educated the Soviet soldier in the sense and aims of the war, it has cultivated love for the Motherland, constantly reinforced their fighting spirit and inspired their staunchness and discipline. All this has created the conditions for our victory.
After the victory over the enemies, the Soviet Union has entered into a new period, into a peaceful period of economic development. The present task of the Soviet people is to assure the conquered positions and to go forward in a new economic effort. We cannot only assure our position as this would mean stagnation; we have to go forward and create the conditions for a new and powerful effort of the national economy. To put it in a word, we have to heal the wounds inflicted on our country by the enemy and reach the pre-war level of the national economy before we can make considerable progress; we have to raise the material well-being of our people and we have to raise the economic and military ability of the Soviet state.
Under these new conditions, the Red Army must vigilantly protect the creative work of the Soviet people, must solidly guarantee the interests of ‘•he Soviet Union and protect the borders of our Motherland and make them inaccessible to any enemy.
During the war the main task of the soldiers, officers and generals of the Red Army consisted of attaining the victory, to concentrate all their knowledge and efforts on the total annihilation of the enemy. In these peaceful times the prime task of our soldiers, officers and generals, without exception, consists of perfecting their military and political abilities. All our soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Red Army have to intensively study military art, have to know their weapons well and perform their duty irreproachably. Now, more than ever, the officers have to be able to educate and instruct their subordinates.
During the war the officers and generals of the Red Army knew well how to lead their troops in battle. Now these officers and generals have to become perfect masters in the education and instruction of their troops in present times.
The Great Patriotic War has introduced much that is new in the military art. The combat experience represents a rich treasure for the instruction and education of the troops. That is why all the instruction of the army should be based on the intelligent application of the experiences of the war. It is also necessary to utilize this experience in all fields for the theoretical instruction of the cadres and officers, for the enriching of Soviet military science. One must ensure that the military art develops constantly and swiftly. The Red Army is obliged not only to follow the development of the military art but  to further progress it. The Red Army is equipped with first-class military material which constitutes the basis for its ability in combat. It knows how to handle this equipment perfectly and it treats it as the apple of its eye.
Any successes in the instruction and education of its troops is impossible without without discipline and a strict military order, because the effectiveness of an army depends on this. This applies especially to the adjutants and sergeants who are the immediate superiors and direct teachers of the soldiers of the Red Army. The soldiers, officers and generals of the Red Army have great merit with the people and the Motherland. But they must not become complacent and vain about this, they must not rest upon their laurels, - but they must conscientiously carry ‘out their duties and they must devote all their strength and knowledge to the service of the Red Army. That is what is demanded of all Soviet soldiers.
Comrades soldiers and sailors of the Red Army and Red Navy, non-commissioned officers, oficers and generals! In the name of the Soviet government and our Communist Party, I greet and congratulate you on the occasion of the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Red Army. To celebrate the day of the Red Army, today, 23 February, I order: A salute of twenty artillery salvoes in the capital of our Motherland, Moscow, in the capitals of the federative republics and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sebastopol and Odessa.
Long live our victorious Red Army!
Long live our victorious sailors of the war!
Long live our glorious Communist Party!
Long live the great Soviet people!   
Long live our powerful Motherland!

## INTERVIEW WITH PRAVDA

TOWARDS the middle of March, 1946, a “Pravda” correspondent requested J. V. Stalin to clarify a number of questions connected with Mr. Churchill’s speech at Fulton, U.S.A. Below are J. V. Stalin’s replies to the correspondent’s questions.



Question: How do you appraise Mr. Churchill’s latest speech in the United States of America?


Answer: I appraise it as a dangerous act, calculated to sow the seeds of dissension among the Allied States and impede their collaboration.


Question: Can it be considered that Mr. Churchill’s speech is prejudicial to the cause of peace and security?


Answer: Yes, unquestionably. As a matter of fact, Mr. Churchill now takes the stand of the warmongers, and in this Mr. Churchill is not alone. He has friends not only in Britain but in the United States of America as well.


A point to be noted is that in this respect Mr. Churchill and his friends bear a striking resemblance to Hitler and his friends. Hitler began his work of unleashing war by proclaiming a race theory, declaring that only German-speaking people constituted a superior nation. Mr. Churchill sets out to unleash war with a race theory, asserting that only English-speaking nations are superior nations, who are called upon to decide the destinies of the entire world. The German race theory led Hitler and his friends to the conclusion that the Germans, as the only superior nation, should rule over other nations. The English race theory leads Mr. Churchill and his friends to the conclusion that the English-speaking nations, as the only superior nations, should rule over the rest of the nations of the world.


Actually, Mr. Churchill, and his friends in Britain and the United States, present to the non-English speaking nations something in the nature of an ultimatum: “Accept our rule voluntarily, and then all will be well; otherwise war is inevitable.”


But the nations shed their blood in the course of five years’ fierce war for the sake of the liberty and independence of their countries, and not in order to exchange the domination of the Hitlers for the domination of the Churchills. It is quite probable, accordingly, that the non-English-speaking nations, which constitute the vast majority of the population of the world, will not agree to submit to a new slavery.


It is Mr. Churchill’s tragedy that, inveterate Tory that he is, he does not understand this simple and obvious truth.


There can be no doubt that Mr. Churchill’s position is a war position, a call for war on the U.S.S.R. It is also clear that this position of Mr. Churchill’s is incompatible with the Treaty of Alliance existing between Britain and the U.S.S.R. True, Mr. Churchill does say, in passing, in order to confuse his readers, that the term of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Collaboration might quite well be extended to 50 years. But how is such a statement on Mr. Churchill’s part to be reconciled with his position of war on the U.S.S.R., with his preaching of War against the U.S.S.R.? Obviously, these things cannot be reconciled by any means whatever. And if Mr. Churchill, who calls for war on the Soviet Union, at the same time considers it possible to extend the term of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty to 50 years, that means that he regards this Treaty as a mere scrap of paper, which he only needs in order to disguise and camouflage his anti-Soviet position. For this reason, the false statements of Mr. Churchill’s friends in Britain, regarding the extension of the term of the Anglo-Soviet treaty to 50 years or more, cannot be taken seriously.Extension of the Treaty term has no point if one of the parties violates the Treaty and converts it into a mere scram of paper.


Question: How do you appraise the part of Mr. Churchill’s speech in which he attacks the democratic systems in the European States bordering upon us, and criticises the good-neighbourly relations established between these States and the Soviet Union.


Answer: This part of Mr. Churchill’s speech is compounded of elements of slander and elements of discourtesy and tactlessness. Mr. Churchill asserts that “Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest, Sofia—all these famous cities and the populations around them lie within the Soviet sphere and are all subject in one form or another not only to Soviet influence, but to a very high and increasing measure of control from Moscow.” Mr. Churchill describes all this as “unlimited expansionist tendencies” on the part of the Soviet Union.


It needs no particular effort to show that in this Mr. Churchill grossly and unceremoniously slanders both Moscow, and the above-named States bordering on the U.S.S.R.


In the first place it is quite absurd to speak of exclusive control by the U.S.S.R. in Vienna and Berlin, where there are Allied Control Councils made up of the representatives of four States and where the U.S.S.R. has only one-quarter of the votes. It does happen that some people cannot help in engaging in slander. But still, there is a limit to everything.


Secondly, the following circumstance should not be forgotten. The Germans made their invasion of the U.S.S.R. through Finland, Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria and Hungary. The Germans were able to make their invasion through these countries because, at the time, governments hostile to the Soviet Union existed in these countries. As a result of the German invasion the Soviet Union has lost irretrievably in the fighting against the Germans, and also through the German occupation and the deportation of Soviet citizens to German servitude, a total of about seven million people. In other words, the Soviet Union’s loss of life has been several times greater than that of Britain and the United States of America put together. Possibly in some quarters an inclination is felt to forget about these colossal sacrifices of the Soviet people which secured the liberation of Europe from the Hitlerite yoke. But the Soviet Union cannot forget about them.And so what can there be surprising about the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future safety, is trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries?How can anyone, who has not taken leave of his wits, describe these peaceful aspirations of the Soviet Union as expansionist tendencies on the part of our State?


Mr. Churchill claims further that the “Russian-dominated Polish Government has been encouraged to make enormous, wrongful inroads on Germany.”


Every word of this is a gross and insulting calumny. Outstanding men are at the helm in present democratic Poland. They have proved by their deeds that they are capable of upholding the interests and dignity of their country as their predecessors were not. What grounds has Mr. Churchill to assert that the leaders of present-day Poland can countenance in their country the domination of representatives of any foreign State whatever? Is it not because Mr. Churchill means to sow the seeds of dissension in the relations between Poland and the Soviet Union that he slanders “the Russians” here?


Mr. Churchill is displeased that Poland has faced about in her policy in the direction of friendship and alliance with the U.S.S.R. There was a time when elements of conflict and antagonism predominated in the relations between Poland and the U.S.S.R.This circumstance enabled statesmen like Mr. Churchill to play on these antagonisms, to get control over Poland on the pretext of protecting her from the Russians, to try to scare Russia with the spectre of war between her and Poland, and retain the position of arbiter for themselves. But that time is past and gone, for the enmity between Poland and Russia has given place to friendship between them, and Poland—present-day democratic Poland—does not choose to be a play-ball in foreign hands any longer. It seems to me that it is this fact that irritates Mr. Churchill and makes him indulge in discourteous, tactless sallies against Poland. Just imagine—he is not being allowed to play his game at the expense of others!


As to Mr. Churchill’s attack upon the Soviet Union in connection with the extension of Poland’s Western frontier to include Polish territories which the Germans had seized in the past—here it seems to me he is plainly cheating. As is known, the decision on the Western frontier of Poland was adopted at the Berlin Three-Power Conference on the basis of Poland’s demands. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that it considers Poland’s demands to be proper and just. It is quite probable that Mr. Churchill is displeased with this decision. But why does Mr. Churchill, while sparing no shots against the Russian position in this matter, conceal from his readers the fact that this decision was passed at the Berlin Conference by unanimous vote—that it was not only the Russians, but the British and Americans as well, that voted for the decision? Why did Mr. Churchill think it necessary to mislead the public?


Further, Mr. Churchill asserts that the Communist Parties, which were previously very small in all these Eastern States of Europe, have been raised to prominence and power far beyond their numbers and seek everywhere to obtain totalitarian control. Police governments prevail in nearly every case, and “thus far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy.”


As is known, the Government of the State in Britain at the present time is in the hands of one party, the Labour Party, and the opposition parties are deprived of the right to participate in the Government of Britain. That Mr. Churchill calls true democracy. Poland, Rumania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary are administered by blocs of several parties—from four to six parties—and the opposition, if it is more or less loyal, is secured the right of participation in the Government. That Mr. Churchill describes as totalitarianism, tyranny and police rule. Why? On what grounds? Don’t expect a reply from Mr. Churchill. Mr. Churchill does not understand in what a ridiculous position he puts himself by his outcry about “totalitarianism, tyranny and police rule.”


Mr. Churchill would like Poland to be administered by Sosnkowski and Anders, Yugoslavia by Mikhailovich and Pavelich, Rumania by Prince Stirbey and Radescu, Hungary and Austria by some King of the House of Hapsburg, and so on. Mr. Churchill wants to assure us that these gentlemen from the Fascist backyard can ensure true democracy.


Such is the “democracy” of Mr. Churchill.


Mr. Churchill comes somewhere near the truth when he speaks of the increasing influence of the Communist Parties in Eastern Europe. It must be remarked, however, that he is not quite accurate. The influence of the Communist Parties has grown not only in Eastern Europe, but in nearly all the countries of Europe which were previously under Fascist rule—Italy, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, Rumania, and Finland—or which experienced German, Italian or Hungarian occupation—France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Soviet Union and so on.


The increased influence of the Communists cannot be considered fortuitous. It is a perfectly logical thing. The influence of the Communists has grown because, in the years of the rule of Fascism in Europe, the Communists showed themselves trusty, fearless, self-sacrificing fighters against the Fascist regime for the liberty of the peoples. Mr. Churchill in his speeches sometimes recalls the plain people from little homes, slapping them patronisingly on the back and parading as their friend.But these people are not so simple as may at first sight appear. These plain people have views of their own, a policy of their own, and they know how to stand up for themselves. It was they, the millions of these plain people, that defeated Mr. Churchill and his party in Britain by casting their votes for the Labourites. It was they, the millions of these “plain people,” who isolated the reactionaries and advocates of collaboration with Fascism in Europe, and gave their preference to the Left democratic parties. It was they, the millions of these “plain people,” who after testing the Communists in the fires of struggle and resistance to Fascism, came to the conclusion that the Communists were fully deserving of the people’s confidence. That was how the influence of the Communists grew in Europe. 


Of course Mr. Churchill does not like this course of development and he sounds the alarm and appeals to force. But neither did he like the birth of the Soviet regime in Russia after the First World War. At that time, too, he sounded the alarm and organised an armed campaign of 14 States against Russia setting himself the goal of turning back the wheel of history. But history proved stronger than the Churchill intervention, and Mr. Churchill’s quixotry led to his unmitigated defeat at that time. I don’t know whether Mr. Churchill and his friends will succeed in organising a new armed campaign against Eastern Europe after the Second World War; but if they do succeed—which is not very probable because millions of plain people stand guard over the cause of peace—it may confidently be said that they will be thrashed, just as they were thrashed once before, 26 years ago.

The Associated Press correspondent Mr. Eddie Gilmore, addressed a number of questions to Generalissimo Stalin pertaining to the International situation. Below are Mr. Gilmore’s questions and Generalissimo Stalin’s replies, dated March 22, 1946:—



Question: What importance do you ascribe to the United Nations Organisation as a means of safeguarding world peace?


Answer: I ascribe great importance to the United Nations Organisation inasmuch as it is a serious instrument for maintaining peace and international security. The strength of this international organisation lies in the fact that it is based on the principle of the equality of States and not on the principle of the domination of some over others. If the United Nations Organisation succeeds in the future, too, in maintaining the principle of equality, then it will undoubtedly play a great positive role in guaranteeing universal peace and security.


Question: What in your opinion is the reason for the present war scare which is felt by many people in many countries?


Answer: I am convinced that neither nations nor their armies seek a new war. They want peace, and seek to secure the peace. That means that the present war scare does not come from that direction. I think that the present war scare is aroused by the actions of certain political groups who are engaged in propaganda for a new war and thus sowing the seeds of dissension and uncertainty.


Question: What should the Governments of the freedom-loving countries do at the present time to safeguard peace and tranquillity throughout the world?


Answer: It is necessary that the public and the ruling circles of the States organise widespread counter-propaganda against the propagandists for a new war, as well as for the maintenance of peace; that not a single utterance of the propagandists for a new war gets away without the rebuff it deserves on the part of public opinion and the press; that in this way the war-mongers be promptly exposed and given no opportunity to misuse freedom of speech against the interests of peace.

Telegram from Mr. Hugh Baillie, President of the United Press Agency, to Generalissimo Stalin, Kremlin, Moscow :
I would like to draw your attention to the declaration made by Winston Churchill to the United   Press,   which   was   transmitted   by   press and radio all over the world.
On this occasion I would like to renew my proposition on behalf of United Press, that you make a declaration on the international’ situation. If you want to reply to Churchill’s argument on the necessity of rapid action of the Security Council of the United Nations Organization on the Iranian question, United Press would be pleased to transmit your views to the whole world. In the case of you wishing to put other questions concerning Iran or international peace and security, d beg you to utilize our possibilities which we place at your disposal with great pleasure.
 
Reply to Mr. Hugh Baillie of United Press, New York :
Thank you for your friendly offer. I do not find Mr. Churchill’s argument convincing. On the question of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran, that will be decided in a positive way by an agreement between the Soviet government and the government of Iran.

Comrades of the Red Army and Red Navy, Sergeants and Mates!
Comrades Officers, Generals and Admirals!
Working people of the Soviet Union!
For the first time since the victory in the Great Patriotic War we celebrate the First of May, the international holiday of the working, people, under peaceful conditions, which we have reached after hard struggle against the enemy and at the price of great sacrifices and sufferings.
A year ago the Red Army raised the banner of victory over Berlin and finished off the smashing of fascist Germany. Four months after the victory over Germany, imperialist Japan capitulated. The Second World War, prepared by the forces of international reaction and started by the main fascist states, ended in complete victory for. the freedom-loving peoples.
The smashing and liquidation of the centres of fascism and world aggression led to a profound change in the political life of the peoples of the world and to a profound growth of the democratic movement of the people. Ripened by the experiences of war, the masses learned that they should not leave the fate of their states in the hands of reactionary leaders who follow limited, self-seeking class interests against the people. Thus, the people who want to change their lives take the fate of their state into their own hands and erect a democratic order and lead an active struggle against the reactionary powers, against the arsonists of a new war.
The peoples of the whole world do not want another war. They struggle desperately for the ensuring of peace and security.
In the vanguard of the struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Union, which has played a leading role in the smashing of fascism and has fulfilled her high mission of liberation.
The peoples who were liberated by the Soviet Union from the fascist yoke were given the possibility of founding their states on democratic principles and to realize their historical hopes. On this path they receive the fraternal help of the Soviet Union.
The whole world was able to convince itself not only of the power of the Soviet state, but also of the just character of its politics, based on the recognition of the equality of all peoples, based on respect for their freedom and self-determination. There is no reason to doubt that the Soviet Union will, in the future, continue these politics which are the politics of peace and security, equality and friendship of the peoples.
Since the ending of the war, the Soviet Union is progressing in peaceful socialist construction. With great enthusiasm the Soviet people are continuing the peaceful constructive work that was interrupted by the war.
The Five Year Plan for the reconstruction and development of the people's economy of the U.S.S.R., for the years 1946 - 1950, that has been approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, opens new perspectives for the further growth of the productive forces of our Motherland, the strengthening of its economic power, the raising of its material wealth and its culture.
The Five Year Plan was accepted by the workers, peasants and intelligentsia of our country as a programme entirely meeting their interests. It can be expected that the Soviet people, led by the Communist Party, will spare no effort not only to fulfil this Five Year Plan, but also to over-fulfil it by their enedeavours.
While we develop this peaceful socialist construction we must not at any moment forget the machinations of international reaction, its plans for a new war. One must not forget the guidelines of the great Lenin that during the transition to peaceful work one must constantly be alert, and constantly keep an eye on the strength of the armed forces and their ability to defend our country.
The armed forces of the Soviet Union, our army, our airforce and our navy have fulfilled their duty towards our Motherland in the Great Patriotic War. The new task for our armed forces is to be on guard, to protect the peace and the constructive work of the Soviet people, and to safeguard the interests of the Soviet Union.
The successful fulfillment of this honourable task is possible only under the conditions of further development of the military culture and art of war of the fighters and commanders of our army, our navy and our airforce.
The armed forces of the Soviet Union have to raise their standards in the art of war, based on the experiences of war, based on the develop-, ment of the science and technique of war.
There is no doubt that our army, our fleet and our airforce will honourably fulfil their task.
Comrades of the Red Army and Red Navy,
Sergeants and  Mates! Comrade Officers, Mates and Generals!
Comrades working men and women, men and women peasants, intellectuals!
Demobilized fighters of the Red Army!
In the name of the government and the Communist Party, I greet you and congratulate you on the occasion of the First of May, on the occasion of the international holiday of the working people, and I order:
Today, 1 May, in the capital of our Motherland, Moscow, in the capitals of the Union Republics as well as in Lvov, Konigsberg, Chabar-ovsk, Vladivostok, Port-Arthur and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol and Odessa, a salute of 20 artillery salvoes.
Long live our brave armed forces!
Long   live  our   glorious  Communist  Party!
Long live the great Soviet people!
Long  live our powerful Soviet Motherland!

Minister of the Armed Forces of the U. S. S. R. Generalissimo of the Soviet Union

## ANSWERS TO WERTH



Replies to Questions put by Mr. Alexander Werth

Replies to Questions put by Mr. Alexander Werth, Moscow, Correspondent of the “Sunday Times”
 September 24, 1946

The following answers were given by J. V. Stalin to questions put by the Moscow correspondent of the “Sunday Times,” Mr. Alexander Werth, in a note addressed to Stalin on September 17, 1946.



Question: Do you believe in a real danger of a “new war” concerning which there is so much irresponsible talk throughout the world today? What steps should be taken to prevent war if such a danger exists?


Answer: I do not believe in a real danger of a “new war.”


Those who are now clamouring about a “new war” are chiefly military-political scouts and their few followers from among the civilian ranks. They need this clamour if only:


(a) to scare certain naive politicians from among their counter-agents with the spectre of war, and thus help their own Governments to wring as many concessions as possible from such counter-agents;


(b) to obstruct for some time the reduction of war budgets in their own countries;


(c) to put a brake on the demobilisation of troops, and thus prevent a rapid growth of unemployment in their own countries.


One must strictly differentiate between the hue and cry about a “new war” which is now taking place, and a real danger of a “new war” which does not exist at present.


Question: Do you believe that Great Britain and the United States of America are consciously placing the Soviet Union in a state of “capitalist encirclement”?


Answer: I do not think that the ruling circles of Great Britain and of the United States of America could create a “capitalist encirclement” of the Soviet Union even if they so desired, which, however, I do not assert.


Question: To quote Mr. Wallace’s recent speech, may Britain, Western Europe and the United States be certain that Soviet policy in Germany will not become an instrument of Russian designs against Western Europe?


Answer: I exclude the use of Germany by the Soviet Union against Western Europe and the United States of America. I consider this out of the question, not only because the Soviet Union is bound with Great Britain and France by the Treaty of Mutual Assistance against German aggression, and with the United States of America by the decisions of the Potsdam Conference of the three Great Powers, but also because a policy of making use of Germany against Western Europe and the United States of America would mean the departure of the Soviet Union from its fundamental national interests.


In short, the policy of the Soviet Union in relation to the German problem reduces itself to the demilitarisation and democratisation of Germany. I believe that the demilitarisation and democratisation of Germany form one of the most important guarantees of the establishment of a stable and lasting peace.


Question: What is your view of the charges that Communist Parties of Western Europe are having their policy “dictated by Moscow”?


Answer: I consider these charges absurd and borrowed from the bankrupt arsenal of Hitler and Goebbels.


Question: Do you believe in the possibility of friendly and lasting co-operation between the Soviet Union and the Western democracies despite the existence of ideological differences, and in the “friendly competition” between the two systems to which Mr. Wallace referred?


Answer: I believe in it absolutely.


Question: During the recent sojourn here of the Labour Party delegation you, as far as I understand, expressed certainty of the possibility of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Great Britain. What could help in establishing these relations so profoundly desired by the broad masses of the British people?


Answer: I am indeed convinced of the possibility of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Great Britain. The strengthening of political, commercial and cultural bonds between these countries would considerably contribute to the establishment of such relations.


Question: Do you believe the earliest withdrawal of all American forces in China to be vital for future peace?


Answer: Yes, I do.


Question: Do you believe that virtual monopoly by the U.S.A. of the atom bomb one of the main dangers to peace?


Answer: I do not believe the atom bomb to be as serious a force as certain politicians are inclined to think. Atomic bombs are intended for intimidating the weak-nerved, but they cannot decide the outcome of war, since atom bombs are by no means sufficient for this purpose. Certainly, monopolistic possession of the secret of the atom bomb does create a threat, but at least two remedies exist against it:


(a) Monopolist possession of the atom bomb cannot last long;


(b) Use of the atom bomb will be prohibited.


Question: Do you believe that with the further progress of the Soviet Union towards Communism the possibilities of peaceful co-operation with the outside world will not decrease as far as the Soviet Union is concerned? Is “Communism in one country” possible?


Answer: I do not doubt that the possibilities of peaceful co-operation, far from decreasing, may even grow. “Communism in one country” is perfectly possible, especially in a country like the Soviet Union.

The following answers were given by J. V. Stalin to questions put to him on October 23, 1946, by Mr. Hugh Baillie, President of the United Press of America:—



1. Question: Do you agree with Secretary Byrnes’ feeling, as expressed in his radio speech last Friday (October 18th), that there is growing tension between the U.S.S.R. end the United States?


Answer: No.



2. Question: If such an increasing tension exists, could you indicate the reason, or reasons for it, and what are the most essential bases for eliminating it?


Answer: The question does not arise in view of my answer to the preceding question.



3. Question: Do you foresee that the present negotiations will result in peace treaties which will establish amicable relations among the nations which were allies in the war against Fascism, and remove the danger of war on the part of former Fascist sources?


Answer: I hope so.



4. Question: If not, what are the principal obstacles to the establishment of such amicable relations among the nations which were allies in the Great War?


Answer: The question does not arise in view of the answer to the preceding question.



5. Question: What is Russia’s attitude with regard to Yugoslavia’s decision not to sign the Peace Treaty with Italy 


Answer: Yugoslavia has grounds to be dissatisfied.



6. Question: What, in your opinion, is to-day the worst threat to world peace?


Answer: The instigators of a new war, in the first place Churchill and people of like mind in Britain and the U.S.A.



7. Question: If such a threat should arise, what steps should be taken by the nations of the world to avoid a new war?


Answer: The instigators of a new war should be exposed and curbed.



8. Question: Is the United Nations Organisation a guarantee of the integrity of the small nations?


Answer: It is hard to say so far.



9. Question: Do you think that the four zones of occupation in Germany should in the near future be thrown together, so far as economic administration is concerned, with a view to restoring Germany as a peaceful economic unit and thus lessening the burden of occupation to the four powers?


Answer: Not only the economic but also the political unity of Germany should be restored.



10. Question: Do you feel that it is feasible at this time to create some sort of central administration to be placed in the hands of the Germans themselves, but under Allied control, which will make it possible for the Council of Foreign Ministers to draft a peace treaty for Germany?


Answer: Yes, I do.



11. Question: Do you feel confident, in the light of elections which have been held in the various zones this summer and fall that Germany is developing politically along democratic lines which give hope for its future as a peaceful nation?


Answer: So far I am not certain of it.



12. Question: Do you feel that, as has been suggested in some quarters, the level of permitted industry should be increased above the agreed level, to permit Germany to pay her own way more fully?


Answer: Yes, I do.



13. Question: What should be done beyond the present four-Power programme to prevent Germany from again becoming a world military menace?


Answer: The remnants of Fascism in Germany should be extirpated in fact and she should be democratised to the end.



14. Question: Should the German people be allowed to reconstruct their industry and trade and become self-supporting?


Answer: Yes, they should.



15. Question: Have the provisions of Potsdam, in your opinion, been adhered to? If not, what is needed to make the Potsdam Declaration an effective instrument?


Answer: They are not always adhered to, especially in the sphere of the democratisation of Germany.



16. Question: Do you feel the veto power has been used to excess during the discussions among the four Foreign Ministers and in meetings of the United Nations Council?


Answer: No, I do not.



17. Question: How far does the Kremlin feel the Allied Powers should go hunting down and trying minor war criminals in Germany? Does it feel that the Nuremberg decisions created a sufficiently strong basis for such action?


Answer: The farther they go the better.



18. Question: Does Russia consider the Western frontiers of Poland permanent?


Answer. Yes, she does.



19. Question: How does the U.S.S.R. regard the presence of British troops in Greece? Does it feel that Britain should supply more arms to the present Greek Government?


Answer: As unnecessary.



20. Question: What is the extent of Russian military contingents in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Austria, and how long do you feel that, in the interests of securing peace, these contingents must be maintained?


Answer: In the West, that is in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Rumania and Poland, the Soviet Union has at present in all 60 divisions (infantry and armour together). Most of them are below full complement. There are no Soviet troops in Yugoslavia. In two months, when the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of October 22 of this year on the last stage of demobilisation is put into effect, 40 Soviet divisions will remain in the above-mentioned countries.



21. Question: What is the attitude of the Government of the U.S.S.R. towards the presence of American warships in the Mediterranean?


Answer: Indifferent.



22. Question: What is the present outlook for a commercial agreement between Russia and Norway?


Answer: It is hard to tell, so far.



23. Question: Is it possible for Finland again to become a self-sufficient nation after reparations have been paid, and is there any idea in contemplation of revising the reparations programme so far as to expedite Finland’s recovery?


Answer: The question has been put in the wrong way. Finland has been and remains an entirely self-sufficient nation.



24. Question: What will trade agreements with Sweden and other countries mean with regard to reconstruction in the U.S.S.R.? What outside aid do you consider desirable in accomplishing this great task?


Answer: The agreement with Sweden constitutes a contribution to the cause of economic co-operation among the nations.



25. Question: Is Russia still interested in obtaining a loan from the United States?


Answer: She is interested.



26. Question: Has Russia developed its own atom bomb or any similar weapon.


Answer: No.



27. Question: What is your opinion of the atom bomb or similar weapon as an instrument of warfare?


Answer: I have already given my appraisal of the atom bomb in the well-known answer to Mr. Worth.



28. Question: How, in your opinion, can atomic power best be controlled? Should this control be created on an international basis, and to what extent should the powers sacrifice their sovereignty in the interest of making the control effective?


Answer: Strict international control is necessary.



29. Question: How long will it require to rebuild the devastated areas of Western Russia?


Answer: Six to seven years, if not more.



30. Question: Will Russia permit commercial airlines to operate across the Soviet Union? Does Russia intend to extend her own airlines to other continents on a reciprocal basis?


Answer: Under certain conditions this is not excluded.



31. Question: How does your Government view the occupation of Japan? Do you fuel it has been a success on the present basis?


Answer: There are some successes, but better successes could have been obtained.

At an interview with J. V. Stalin in the Kremlin on December 21, 1946 Mr. Elliott Roosevelt put 12 questions. These, together with Stalin’s answers, were published in the American Magazine “Look” and then broadcast by Moscow Radio.



1. Question: Do you believe it is possible for a democracy such as the United States to live peaceably side by side in this world with a communistic form of government like the Soviet Union's and with no attempt on the part of either to interfere with the internal political affairs of the other?


Answer: Yes, of course. This is not only possible. It is wise and entirely within the bounds of realisation. In the most strenuous times during the war the differences in government did not prevent our two nations from joining together and vanquishing our foes. Even more so is it possible to continue this relationship in time of peace.



2. Question: Do you believe that the success of the United Nations depends upon agreement as to fundamental policies and aims between the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States?


Answer: Yes, I think so. In many respects the fate of the United Nations as an organisation depends upon a state of harmony being reached by those three powers.



3. Question: Do you believe, Generalissimo Stalin, that an important step toward world peace would be the attainment of economic agreement of broader scope for the interchange of manufactured and raw materials between our two countries?


Answer: Yes, I believe that it would be an important step for the establishment of world peace. Of course, I agree. The expansion of world trade would benefit in many respects the development of good relations between our two countries.



4. Question: Is the Soviet Union in favour of the immediate creation by the United Nations Security Council of an international police force composed of all the United Nations, which would step in immediately wherever armed warfare threatens peace?


Answer: Of course.



5. Question: If you believe that the atomic bomb should be controlled by the United Nations, should not they, through inspection, control all research and manufacturing facilities for armaments of any nature and the peace-time use and development of atomic energy?



(At this point Mr. Elliott Roosevelt parenthetically says: “Stalin shot back at me a quick question: ‘In general?’ I said, ‘Yes, but, especially as to agreement an principle by Russia to such a plan.’”)



Answer: Of course. To the principle of equality no exception should be made in the case of Russia. Russia should be subject to the same rules of inspection and control as any other nation must.



(At this point Mr. Elliott Roosevelt parenthetically says: “There was no hesitancy in his answer. And no question of reserving the right of veto was even mentioned.”)



6. Question: Do you think it would serve a useful purpose if another Big Three meeting was held for discussion of all international problems at present threatening peace in the world?


Answer: I think there should not be one meeting, but several; they would serve a useful purpose.



(Here Mr. Elliott Roosevelt parenthetically says: “At this point my wife asked whether he thought that such meetings would help towards achieving closer relations at lower levels among officials of the respective Governments. She also asked whether such a result was achieved by the wartime conferences. His answer came with a smile in her direction: ‘There is no doubt of that, the wartime meetings and the results achieved greatly helped co-operation at lower levels.’”)



7. Question: Sir, I know you are a student of many other political and social problems existing in other countries. And so I should like to ask whether you feel that the elections in the United States last November indicate a swing away, on the part of the people, from belief in the policies of Roosevelt and towards the isolationist policies of his political adversaries?


Answer: I am not so well acquainted with the internal life of the people of the United States, but I would think the election indicated that the present Government was wasting the moral and political capital created by the late President, and thus it facilitated the victory of the Republicans.



(At this point Mr. Elliott Roosevelt parenthetically says: “In answering my next question Generalissimo Stalin became very emphatic.”)



8. Question: To what do you ascribe the lessening of friendly relations and understanding between our two countries since the death of Roosevelt?


Answer: I feel that if this question relates to the relations and understanding between the American and Russian peoples, no deterioration has taken place, but on the contrary relations have improved. As to the relations between the two Governments, there have been misunderstandings. A certain deterioration has taken place, and then great noise has been raised that their relations would even deteriorate still further. But I see nothing frightful about this in the sense of violation of peace or military conflict.


Not a single Great Power, even if its Government is anxious to do so, could et present raise a large army to fight another Allied Power, another Great Power, because at present one cannot possibly fight without one’s people—and the people are unwilling to fight.They are tired of war.


Moreover, there are no understandable objectives to justify anew war. One would not know for what he had to fight, and therefore I see nothing frightful in the fact that sonic representatives of the United States Government are talking about deterioration of relations between us.


In view of all these considerations I think the danger of a new war is unreal.



9. Question: Do you favour a broad exchange of cultural and scientific information between our two nations? Also, do you favour exchange of students, artists, scientists and professors?


Answer: of course.


10. Question: Should the United States and the Soviet Union form a common long-term policy of aid to the peoples of the Far East?


Answer: I feel it will be useful if it is possible. In any case our Government is ready to pursue a common policy with the United States in Far Eastern questions.



11. Question: If a systcm of loans or credits is arranged between the United States and the Soviet Union, would such agreements have lasting benefit to United States economy?


Answer: A system of such credits is of course mutually advantageous both to the United States and to the Soviet Union



(Here Mr. Elliott Roosevelt parenthetically says: “I then asked the question that is creating obvious concern in many countries of Europe.”)



12. Question: Does the failure in the American and British zones of occupied Germany to carry out denazification give serious cause for alarm to the Soviet Government?


Answer: No, it has not been a cause for serious alarm, but of course it is unpleasant for the Soviet Union that part of our common programme is not being put into effect.

## ANSWER TO BEVIN 



Exchange of Messages Between Mr. E. Bevin and J. V. Stalin, Concerning the Anglo-Soviet Treaty






J. V. Stalin
Exchange of Messages Between Mr. E. Bevin and J. V. Stalin, Concerning the Anglo-Soviet Treaty
January 19 and January 22, 1947

On January 18, 1947, Mr. Bevin, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Great Britain, through the medium of the British Ambassador in the U.S.S.R., Sir M. Peterson, conveyed the following message to J. V. Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.:—



I am gratified at the friendly reception which was given to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in Moscow and am studying with interest the account which he has given me of his conversations with you.


We are however disturbed at the suggestion which you made to him that the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Post-War Collaboration might be regarded in London as “suspended in the air” since it might be regarded as superseded by the United Nations Organisation.This view has been attributed to me personally in the most misleading manner by Pravda in an article of January 15, which takes out of its context and misinterprets one sentence in my broadcast of December 22. In fact, I said what all the other major Allies have said, namely, that they based their policy on the United Nations Organisation.


I cannot understand what is behind this line of reasoning, and I am more amazed at the Pravda article since I understand from Field-Marshal Montgomery that you said this was not your own view regarding the Treaty. It is certainly not my view either.


Since Pravda has published this misleading article, I have no alternative but to issue a statement which I should like you to see in advance, making the views of His Majesty’s Government clear once again on this subject. I propose to publish it on the morning of January 20.



On January 23, 1947, J. V. Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., sent to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Great Britain the following message in reply, which was handed to Mr. Bevin by the Soviet Ambassador in London, G. N. Zarubin, on January 23:—



I have received your message of January 18. I must admit that your statement that Great Britain is not tied to anybody except in regard to her obligations arising from the Charter caused me some perplexity.


It seems to me that such a statement without a corresponding explanation can be used by the enemies of Anglo-Soviet friendship. For one it is clear that no matter what reservations there are in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, and no matter how these reservations weaken the significance of the Treaty in the post-war period, the existence of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty imposes obligations on our countries.


It was just these circumstances that I had in mind when I stated on September 17, 1946, in my interview with Mr. Alexander Worth, that “the Soviet Union is bound with Great Britain by the Treaty of Mutual Assistance against German aggression” and, that means, has obligations with regard to Great Britain, not counting the obligations arising from the Charter.


However, your message and the statement of the British Government completely explain the affair and do not leave any room for misunderstandings. It is now clear that you and I share the same view-point with regard to the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.


As regards the extension of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, to which special reference is made in the British Government’s statement, I must say that if one is to speak seriously of such an extension, then, before extending this Treaty, it is necessary to change it, freeing it from the reservations which weaken this Treaty. Only after such a procedure would it be possible to talk seriously of an extension of the Treaty.

The elections to the Supreme Soviets of the Federal Republics, which were held, have resulted in the complete victory of the bloc of Communists and their Party. It shows that the unity of Soviet society is indestructible, that all the Soviet citizens are firmly grouped behind their government and the Communist Party, and are firmly assuring the development of their Motherland.
In times of peace, the Soviet Army must accomplish the task of military preparation which they have been set, march in advance and win new and more important successes in military preparation and political education. The work of consolidating peace and the security of our country is required.
The essential principle of the military preparation of the Soviet armed forces has always consisted, and still consists today, of educating the troops in war conditions. The experience of the last war has proved the high morale and combat quality of the troops, a good military and political preparation, a great mastery of the techniques of combat, coordination and great physical endurance.
The task that now faces our army, navy and airforce is to untiringly perfect, day by day,  their military formation, to profitably pursue profound study based on their experience of war.
The generals, admirals and officers must continue to broaden their knowledge of military theory and politics and equally learn the methods of military preparation, which are necessary for training in peace time.
The non-commissioned officers must .energetically apply the process of command to become the prime aides of officers in the observance of military discipline and in the instruction and education of soldiers and sailors.
The soldiers and sailors must, with all their might, perefct in detail their preparation from the point of view of mastery of weapons, of special military tactics and political formations; they must acquire the necessary physical strength to take part in combat and be able to surmount all difficulties of battles and combat.
In the instruction and education of their subordinates, all the commanders and chiefs must take it upon themselves to care for their conditions of life, their physical well-being and their equipment, in accordance with the regulations.
Strong military discipline is primarily based on the high conscience and political education of the military and is the preliminary condition of most importance for the combat strength of our armed forces. Also, all the commanders and chiefs must untiringly affirm military discipline and, very necessary, encourage the spirit of patriotism   unceasingly   in   their   subordinates,   the sense of personal responsibility of every soldier for the defence of the Motherland.
Comrades soldiers, sailors and non-commissioned officers!
Comrades officers,  generals  and  admirals!
I salute and congratulate you on the occasion of the twenty-ninth anniversary of our Soviet Army, in the name of the Soviet government and of our Communist Party.
In honour of the twenty-ninth anniversary of the Soviet Army, I order: today, 23 February, a salute of twenty artillery salvoes in the capital of our Motherland, Moscow, in the capitals of the federative republics, in Koliningrad, Lvov, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Port Arthur and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sebastopol and Odessa.
Long live the Soviet Army and the military sailors!
Long live our Soviet government!
Long live our great Communist Party!
Long live our great Soviet people!

## INTERVIEW WITH STASSEN



Coexistence, American-Soviet Cooperation, Atomic Energy, Europe

[Interview with Harold Stassen, April 9, 1947]



Stassen: Generalissimo Stalin, on this European trip I am particularly interested in studying conditions of an economic nature. In this regard, of course, the relations of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. are very important. I realize that we have two economic systems that are very different. The U.S.S.R. with the Communist Party and with its planned economy and socialized collective state, and the United States of America with its free economy and regulated private capitalism are very different. I would be interested to know if you think these two economic systems can exist together in the same modern world in harmony with each other?


Stalin: Of course they can. The difference between them is not important so far as co-operation is concerned. The systems in Germany and the United States are the same but war broke out between them. The U.S. and U.S.S.R. systems are different but we didn’t wage war against each other and the U.S.S.R. does not propose to. If during the war they could co-operate, why can’t they today in peace, given the wish to co-operate? Of course, if there is no desire to co-operate, even with the same economic system they may fall out as was the case with Germany.


Stassen: I believe, of course, that they can co-operate if they both have the desire to, but there have been many statements about not being able to co-operate. Some of these were made by the Generalissimo himself before the war. But is it possible, now that the fascist axis has been defeated, that the situation has changed?


Stalin:  It’s not possible that I said that the two economic systems could not co-operate. Co-operation ideas were expressed by Lenin. I might have said that one system was reluctant to co-operate, but that concerned only one side. But as to the possibility of co-operation, I adhere to Lenin who expressed both the possibility and the desire of co-operation. As to the desire of the people to co-operate on the part of the U.S.S.R. and the Party, it is possible—and the two countries could only benefit by this co-operation.


Stassen: That last part is clear. The statements I referred to are those made by you at the Eighteenth Communist Party Congress in 1939 and the plenary session in 1937—statements about capitalist encirclement and monopoly. I assume from your statement now that the defeat of fascist Germany and Japan has not charged that situation.


Stalin:There was not a single Party congress or plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party at which I said or could have said that co-operation between the two systems was impossible. I did say that there existed capitalist encirclement and danger of attack on the U.S.S.R. If one party does not wish to co-operate, then that means there exists a threat of attack. And actually Germany, not wishing to co-operate with the U.S.S.R., attacked the U.S.S.R. Could the U.S.S.R, have co-operated with Germany? Yes, the U.S.S.R. could have cooperated with Germany but the Germans did not wish to co-operate. Otherwise the U.S.S.R. could have co-operated with Germany as with any other country. As you see, this concerns the sphere of desire and not the possibility of co-operating. It is necessary to make a distinction between the possibility; of co-operating and the wish to co-operate. The possibility of co-operation always exists but there is not always present the wish to co-operate. If one party does not wish to co-operate, then the result will be conflict, war.


Stassen:  It must be mutual.


Stalin:  Yes. I want to bear testimony to the fact that Russia wants to co-operate.


Stassen:  I wish to point out with reference to your earlier statement that there was a great difference between Germany and the United States at the time Germany started the war.


Stalin:  There was a difference in government but no difference in the economic systems. The government was a temporary factor.


Stassen:  I do not agree. Yes, there was a difference of economic systems too. Imperialism, the development of state monopoly, and the oppression of workers are the evils of capitalism practiced by the Nazis. It seems to me we have been successful in America in preventing the monopoly of capitalism and the imperialistic trend, and that the workers have made greater progress through use of the strength of their vote and their freedom than Karl Marx or Frederick Engels thought they could make-and this regulation of free capital and prevention of monopoly and freedom of workers in America makes the economic situation quite different from that which existed in Germany.


Stalin:  Let us not mutually criticize our systems. Everyone has the right to follow the system he wants to maintain. Which one is better will be said by history. We should respect the systems chosen by the people, and whether the system is good or bad is the business of the American people. To co-operate, one does not need the same systems. One should respect the other system when approved by the people. Only on this basis can we secure co-operation. Only, if we criticize, it will lead us too far.


As for Marx and Engels, they were unable to foresee what would happen forty years after their death. But we should adhere to mutual respect of people. Some people call the Soviet system totalitarian. Our people call the American system  monopoly capitalism. If we start calling each other names with the words monopolist and totalitarian, it will lead to no co-operation.


We must start from the historical fact that there are two systems approved by the people. Only on that basis is co-operation possible. If we distract each other with criticism, that is propaganda.


As to propaganda, I am not a propagandist but a business-like man. We should not be sectarian. When the people wish to change the systems they will do so. When we met with Roosevelt to discuss the questions of war, we did not call each other names. We established co-operation and succeeded in defeating the enemy.


Stassen:  That sort of criticism has been a cause of misunderstanding after the war. Do you look forward in the future to a greater exchange of ideas and news, of students and teachers, of artists, of tourists, if there is co-operation?


Stalin:  This will happen inevitably if co-operation is established. For an exchange of goods will lead to an exchange of people. . . .


Stassen:  As I see it, then, you think it is possible that there will be co-operation provided there is a will and desire to co-operate. Stalin:  That is correct.


Stassen:  In the development of the standards of living of the people, mechanization and electrification have been of major significance. The new development of atomic energy is of very great importance to all peoples of the world. I feel that the matter of international inspection, effective controls and outlawing the use for war of atomic energy is of supreme importance to all peoples of the world. Do you feel that there is a reasonable prospect of working out agreements for the long-term future for the peaceful development of atomic energy?


Stalin:  I hope for this. There are big differences of views among us, but in the long run I hope we shall come to an understanding. International control and inspection will be established, in any view, and it will be of great importance. The peaceful use of atomic energy will bring great technological changes. It is a very great matter. As for the use of atomic energy for war purposes, this in all probability will be prohibited. It will be a problem in the long run that will be met by the consciences of the people and it will be prohibited.


Stassen:  Yes, that is one of our important problems and if solved it can be a great boon—and if not, a great curse to the people of the world.


Stalin:  I think we shall succeed in establishing international inspection and control. Things are leading up to it.


Stassen:  I appreciate the opportunity of talking with you.



(The interview had now lasted forty minutes and Stassen prepared to take his leave. However, Stalin indicated a willingness to continue the discussion. The remainder of the conversation dealt with prevailing economic conditions in Europe and the United States.—Ed.)

## GREETINGS TO MOSCOW

Greetings- to Moscow, the capital of our country, on its 800th anniversary.
The entire country is today celebrating this significant day. It is celebrating it no”t formally, but with feelings of love and reverence, because of ? the great services Moscow has rendered our country.
The services which Moscow has rendered are not only that it thrice in the course of the history of our country liberated her from foreign oppression - from the Mongolian yoke, from Polish-Lithuanian invasion and from French incursion. The service Moscow rendered is primarily that it became the basis for uniting disunited Russia into a single state, with a single government and a single leadership. No country in the world can count on preserving its independence, on real economic and cultural growth, if it has not succeeded in liberating itself from feudal disunity and strife among princes. Only a country which is united in a single, centralized state can count on the possibility of real cultural and economic growth, on the possibility of firmly establishing its independence. The historic service which Moscow rendered is that it has been and remains the basis and the initiator in the creation of a centralized state in Russia.
But this is not the only service that Moscow has rendered our country. After Moscow, by the will of our great Lenin, was again proclaimed the capial of our country, it became the banner bearer of the new, Soviet epoch.
Moscow is today not only the inspirer in the building of the new, Soviet social and economic order, which substituted the rule of Labour for the rule of capital and rejected the exploitation of man by man. Moscow is also the herald of the movement for the liberation of toiling mankind from capitalist slavery.
Moscow is today not only the inspirer in the building of the new, Soviet democracy, which rejects all, direct or indirect, inequality of citizens, sexes, races and nations, and ensures the right to work and the right to equal pay for equal work. Moscow is also the banner of the struggle which all the working people in the world, all the oppressed races and nations, are waging to liberate themselves from the rule of plutocracy and imperialism. There can be no doubt that without this policy Moscow could not have become the centre of organization of the friendship of nations and of their fraternal cooperation in our multi-national state.
Moscow is today not only the initiator in the building of the new way of life of the working people of the capital, a life free from want and wretchedness suffered by millions of poor and unemployed. Moscow is also a model for all the capitals in the world in this respect. One of the gravest sores of the large capitals of countries in Europe, Asia and America are the slums in which millions of impoverished working people are doomed to wretchedness and a slow and painful death. The service which Moscow has rendered is that it completely abolished these slums and gave the working people the opportunity to move out of their cellars and hovels into the apartments and houses of the bourgeoisie and into the new comfortable houses which have been built by the Soviet authorities.
Lastly, the service Moscow renders is that it is the herald of the struggle for durable peace and friendship among the nations, the herald of the struggle against the incendiaries of a new war. For the imperialists, war is the most profitable undertaking. It is not surprising that the agents of imperialism are trying, in ‘one way or another, to provoke a new war. The service which Moscow renders is that it unceasingly exposes the incendiaries of a new war and rallies around the banner of peace all the peace-loving nations. It is common knowledge that the peace-loving nations look with hope to Moscow as the capital of the great peace-loving power and as a mighty bulwark of peace.
It is because of these services that our country is today celebrating the 800th anniversary of Moscow with such love and reverence for her capital.
Long live our mighty, beloved, Soviet, Socialist Moscow!

Mr. President!
As you know, two out of three of the countries bordering the U.S.S.R., that stood on the side of Germany against the U.S.S.R. during the war, namely Hungary and Rumania, have signed a support treaty against an eventual German aggression with the U.S.S.R.
As is also known, our two countries stood together strongly in sympathy throughout this aggression, in which we, together with you, bear the responsibility before our peoples if we allow the repetition of such an aggression.
I am of the opinion that a support treaty with the U.S.S.R., against an eventual German aggression is of no less, interest for Finland than for Rumania and Hungary.
Out of these considerations and from the wish to create better relations between our countries for the strengthening of peace and security, the Soviet government offers the conclusion of a Soviet-Finnish Friendship, Cooperation and Support Treaty like the Hungarian-Soviet and Rumanian-Soviet treaties.
Should   there   be   no   objections   from the Finnish side, I would propose that a Finnish delegation be sent to the U.S.S.R. to conclude such a treaty.
Should it be more convenient for you to carry through the negotiations and the conclusion of the treaty in Finland, the Soviet government offers to send their delegation to Helsinki.
Yours respectfully, 
J. STALIN
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.

## SPEECH AT THE DINNER FOR THE FINNISH DELEGATION

I would like to say a few words about the significance of the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Help between the Soviet Union and Finland, which was signed yesterday.
This treaty signifies a change in the relations between our countries. As it is known, in the course of 150 years of relations between Russia and Finland there has been mutual distrust. The Finns distrusted the Russians, the Russians distrusted the Finns. From the Soviet side  there  resulted  an attempt  in  the  past  to break the distrust that stood between the Russians and the Finns. That was at the time that Lenin, in 1917, proclaimed the independence of Finland. From an historical point of view, that was an outstanding act. But sadly the distrust was not thereby broken - the distrust stayed distrust.  The  result  was  two wars  between us.
I would like us to go over from the long period of mutual distrust in the course of which we went to war with each other twice, to a new period in our relations: the period of mutual trust.
It is necessary that the conclusion of this treaty breaks this distrust and builds a new basis for relations between our peoples and that it signifies a great change in the relations between our countries . towards trust and . friendship.
We want this acknowledged not only by those present in this hall, but also by those outside this hall, as much in Finland as in the Soviet Union.
One must not believe that the distrust, between our peoples can be removed all at once. That is not done so quickly. For a long time there will be remnants of this distrust, for the abolition of which one must work and struggle hard, and to build and strengthen a tradition of mutual friendship between the U.S.S.R. and Finland.
There are treaties that are based upon equality and some that are not. The Soviet-Finnish   treaty is  a  treaty   that   is  based  upon equality, it has been concluded on the basis of full equality of the partners.
Many believe that between a big and little nation there cannot be relations which are based on equality. But we Soviet people are of the opinion that such relations can and should exist. We Soviet people are of the opinion that every nation, great or small, has special- qualities that only they have and no other nation possesses. These peculiarities are their contribution, that every nation should contribute, to the common treasure of the culture of the world. In this sense, all nations, big and small, are in the same situation, and’ every nation is as equally important as the next nation.
So the Soviet people are of the opinion that Finland, although a small country, is in this treaty, as equal a partner as the Soviet Union.
You do not find many politicians of the great powers that would regard the small nations as the equals of the larger nations. Most of them look down upon the small nations. They are not disinclined, occasionally, to make a onesided guarantee for a small nation. These politicians do not, in general, conclude treaties which depend on equality, with small nations, as they do not regard small nations as their partners.
I propose a toast to the Soviet-Finnish treaty, and to the change for the better in the relations between our countries that this treaty signifies.

## ON THE OPEN LETTER OF HENRY WALLACE



Answer to the Open Letter of Henry Wallace

Answer to the Open Letter of Henry Wallace

I believe that among the political documents of recent times, that have the strengthening of peace, the furthering of international cooperation and the securing of democracy as their aims, the open letter of Henry Wallace, the presidential candidate of the Third Party in the U.S.A., is the most important.
The open letter of Wallace cannot be regarded as a mere exposition of the wish to improve the international situation, as an exposition of the wish for a peaceful settlement of the differences of opinion between the Soviet Union and the U.S.A., and the wish to find a way towards such a settlement. The declaration of the government of the U.S.A. of 4 May, and the answer of the Soviet government of 9 May are, therefore, insufficient, because they do not go so far as to declare that the settlement of the Soviet-American differences of opinion is desirable.
The great importance of the open letter lies in the fact that it is not limited just to that, to giving a declaration, but rather exceeds that, - a more important step, an advance, -and proposes a concrete programme for the peaceful settlement of the differences of opinion between the Soviet Union and the U.S.A.
One cannot   say   that   the   open   letter  of Wallace invariably deals with all the differences. One also cannot say that none of the formulas and opinions in the open letter need to be improved. But that is not the important thing at the moment. The important thing is that Wallace, in his letter, makes an open and honest attempt to work out a peaceful programme for a peaceful settlement and gives concrete proposals on all the points of difference between the Soviet Union and the U.S.A.
These proposals are generally known : 
General   limitation  of  armaments  and  the forbidding of atomic  weapons.  Conclusion of a peace  treaty with Germany and Japan and the withdrawal  of  the  troops  from  these countries.
Withdrawal of the troops from China and Korea.
Consideration for the right of nations to self-determination and non-interference in their internal affairs.
Forbidding the building of military bases in the countries that belong to the United Nations.
Development of international trade in every area, with the elimination of all discrimination.
Help  and  rebuilding within the framework of the United Nations for countries that suffered from the war.
Defence of democracy and the securing of civil rights in all countries, etc.
One can be for or against these proposals; but  no statesman  that   has  anything  to do with the matter of peace and cooperation of nations can ignore this programme, which reflects the hopes and longing of the peoples for the strengthening of peace, and which, without doubt, will find the support of millions of the common people.
I do not know whether the government of the U.S.A. acknowledges the programme of Wallace as a basis for understanding between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. As far as the government of the U.S.S.R. is concerned, we believe that the programme of Wallace could be a good and fruitful foundation for such understanding and for the development of international cooperation, because the government of the U.S.S.R. is of the opinion that despite the differences in their economic systems and ideologies, these systems can live side by side and that peaceful settlement of the differences between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. is not only possible, but also absolutely necessary in the interests of general peace.

## ANSWERS TO PRAVDA



Berlin Crisis, the U.N. and Anglo-American Agressive Policies, Churchill






J. V. Stalin
Berlin Crisis, the U.N. and Anglo-American Agressive Policies, Churchill
October 28, 1948


Source: For Peaceful Coexistence: Post War Interviews

Transcription/Markup: Brian Reid


[Interview with correspondent of Pravda, October 28, 1948]



Question: How do you regard the results of the discussions in the Security Council on the question of the situation in Berlin and the conduct of the Anglo-American and French representatives in this matter?


Answer: I regard them as a display of the aggressiveness of the policy of Anglo-American and French ruling circles. 


Question: Is it true that in August of this year agreement had already been reached among the four powers on the question of Berlin?


Answer: Yes, that is true. Agreement is known to have been reached in Moscow on August 30 last, among the representatives of the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A., Great Britain, and France regarding the simultaneous implementation of measures for the lifting of transport restrictions, on the one hand, and for the introduction of the German mark of the Soviet zone in Berlin as the sole currency, on the other hand. That agreement does not hurt anyone’s prestige. It takes into account the interests of the parties concerned and insures the possibility of further co-operation. But the governments of the U.S.A. and Great Britain disavowed then representatives in Moscow and declared the agreement to be null and void, that is, they violated the agreement, having decided to refer the question to the Security Council where the Anglo-Americans have a guaranteed majority.


Question: Is it true that, in Paris during the recent discussions on the question in the Security Council, an agreement on the situation in Berlin had again been reached in unofficial talks even before the question was voted upon in the Security Council?


Answer: Yes. That is true. Dr. Bramuglia, the representative of the Argentine and president of the Security Council, who conducted unofficial talks with Comrade Vishinsky on behalf of the other powers concerned, did have in his hands an agreed-upon draft decision on the question of the situation in Berlin. But the representatives of the U.S.A. and Great Britain once again declared that agreement to be null and void.


Question: What is the matter then? Would you explain?


Answer: The thing is that those in the United States and Great Britain who inspire an aggressive policy do not consider themselves interested in an agreement and in co-operation with the U.S.S.R. What they want is not agreement and co-operation, but talk about agreement and co-operation, so as to put the blame on the U.S.S.R. by preventing agreement and thus to “prove” that co-operation with the U.S.S.R. is impossible. What the war instigators who are striving to unleash a new war fear most of all is the reaching of agreements and co-operation with the U.S.S.R. because a policy of concord with the U.S.S.R. undermines the position of the instigators of war and deprives the aggressive policy of these gentlemen of any purpose.


It is for this reason that they disrupt agreements that have already been reached, that they disavow their representatives who have drawn up such agreements together with the U.S.S.R., and in violation of the United Nations Charter refer the question to the Security Council, where they have a guaranteed majority and where they can “prove” whatever they like. All this is done to “show” that co-operation with the U.S.S.R. is impossible and to “show” the necessity for a new war, and thus to prepare the ground for the unleashing of war. The policy of the present leaders of the U.S.A. and Great Britain is a policy of aggression, a policy of unleashing a new war.


Question: How should one regard the conduct of the representatives of the six states, members of the Security Council: of China, Canada, Belgium, Argentina, Colombia, and Syria?


Answer: Those gentlemen are obviously lending their support to the policy of aggression, to the policy of unleashing a new war. 


Question: What can all this end in?


Answer: It can only end in ignominious failure on the part of the instigators of a new war. Churchill, the main instigator of a new sear, has already managed to deprive himself of the trust of his own nation and of democratic forces throughout the world. The same fate lies in store for all other instigators of war. The horrors of the recent war are still too fresh in the memory of the peoples; and public forces favoring peace are too strong for Churchill’s pupils in aggression to overpower them and to turn them toward a new war.

## ANSWERS TO KINGSBURY SMITH



Berlin, Disarmament, Stalin-Truman Meeting






J. V. Stalin
Berlin, Disarmament, Stalin-Truman Meeting
January 27, 1949


Source: For Peaceful Coexistence: Post War Interviews
Publisher: International Publishers, New York, 1951
Transcription/Markup: Brian Reid


[Interview with Kingsbury Smith, representative of International News Service, January 27, 1949]



Question: Would the government of the U.S.S.R. be prepared to consider the issuance of a joint declaration with the government of the United States of America, asserting that the respective governments have no intention of resorting to war against one another?


Answer: The Soviet government would be prepared to consider the issuance of such a declaration.


Question: Would the government of the U.S.S.R, be prepared to join with the government of the United States of America in measures designed to implement this pact of peace, such as gradual disarmament?


Answer: Naturally, the government of the U.S.S.R. could cooperate with the government of the United States of America in taking measures designed to implement this pact of peace and leading to gradual disarmament.


Question: If the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and France agreed to postpone the establishment of a separate Western German state, pending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to consider the German problem as a whole, would the Government of the U.S.S.R. be prepared to remove the restrictions which the Soviet authorities have imposed on communications between Berlin and the Western zones of Germany?


Answer: Provided the United States of America, Great Britain, and France observe the conditions set forth in the third question, the Soviet government sees no obstacles to lifting transport restrictions, on the understanding, however, that transport and trade restrictions introduced by the three Powers should be lifted simultaneously.


Question: Would Your Excellency be prepared to confer with President Truman at a mutually suitable place to discuss the possibility of concluding such a pact of peace?


Answer: I have already stated before that there is no objection to a meeting.



[Smith later sent the following telegram to Stalin]


The official representative of the White House, Charles Ross, stated today that President Truman would be glad to have the opportunity to confer with you in Washington. Would Your Excellency be prepared to go to Washington for this purpose? If not, then where would you be prepared to meet the President?



[The reply was as follows:]


Your telegram of February 1 received. I am grateful to President Truman for the invitation to come to Washington. For a long time it has been my wish to visit Washington, and at one time I mentioned this to President Roosevelt at Yalta, and to President Truman at Potsdam.


Unfortunately, at present I am unable to realize this wish of mine, since doctors strongly object to my undertaking any prolonged journey, especially by sea or air.


The government of the Soviet Union would welcome the President’s visit to the U.S.S.R. A conference could be arranged at the President’s choice: in Moscow, Leningrad, Kaliningrad, Odessa, or at Yalta, provided, of course, this does not go against the President’s consideration of convenience.


However, should this suggestion meet with objection, a meeting could be arranged, at the President’s discretion, in Poland or Czechoslovakia.

To Mr. Kingsbury Smith, European General Director of the "International News Service" Agency.
I have received your telegram of 1 February.
I thank President Truman for the invitation to Washington. It i has long been my wish to travel to Washington, as I formerly said to President Roosevelt in Yalta and to President Truman in Potsdam. Sadly, I do not have the possibility of realizing my wish at present, as the doctor has decided against my making a long journey, especially by sea or air.
The government of the Soviet Union would greet a visit from the President to the U.S.S.R. One could hold a conference in Moscow, Leningrad or in Kaliningrad, Odessa or Yalta, whichever the President chooses, - of course, in so far as it presents no inconvenience.
However, if this proposal meets with objections, one could hold a meeting in Poland or in Czechoslovakia, at the President’s convenience.
Respectfully,

## TELEGRAM TO PIECK AND GROTEWOHL ON THE FOUNDING OF THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC



Peace in Europe






J. V. Stalin
Peace in Europe
October 13, 1949


Source: For Peaceful Coexistence: Post War Interviews
Publisher: International Publishers, New York, 1951
Transcription/Markup: Brian Reid


[Greetings to the President and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, October 13, 1949]



Allow me to congratulate you and, in your persons, the German people, on the creation of the German Democratic Republic and the election of the former to the presidency and the latter as Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.


The formation of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic is a turning point in the history of Europe. There can be no doubt that the existence of a peace-loving democratic Germany side by side with the existence of the peace-loving Soviet Union excludes the possibility of new wars in Europe, puts an end to bloodshed in Europe, and makes impossible the enslaving of European countries by the world imperialists.


The experience of the recent war showed that the biggest sacrifices in this war were borne by the German and Soviet peoples, and that these two peoples possess the greatest potentialities in Europe for accomplishing great actions of world importance. If these two peoples display determination to fight for peace, straining their energies to the same extent as they did to wage war, peace in Europe may then be considered as secured.


Thus laying the foundation for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, you simultaneously perform a great deed for all of Europe, guaranteeing her lasting peace.


You need not doubt that in advancing along this road and promoting the cause of peace you will find great sympathy and active support among all the peoples of the world, including the American, British, French, Polish, Czechoslovak, and Italian peoples, let alone the peace-loving Soviet people. I wish you success on this new and glorious road. May unified, independent, democratic, peace-loving Germany live and prosper!

Dear Mr. Minister President,
The Soviet government has examined the request of the government of the German Democratic Republic on the reduction of the reparation sum to be paid by Germany.
The  Soviet  government  has,  at  the same time, borne in mind that the German Democratic Republic has been conscientious and regular in their fulfilment of their reparation obligation, which is charged as high as 10 billion dollars, and that by the end of 1950 an important part of this obligation, as much as 3658 million dollars, wijl have been realized.
Led by the wish to ease the efforts of the German people in the reconstruction and development of the people’s economy in Germany, and bearing in mind the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet government has decided, with the agreement of the government of the Polish Republic, to reduce the remaining sum of ‘the reparation bill by 50%, to 3171 million dollars.
In agreement with the declaration of the government of the U.S.S.R. at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in March 1947, and the settlement of a twenty year term for the payment of reparation, the Soviet government has further decided to accept payment of the remaining part of the reparation bill in German goods (as much as 3171 million dollars) out of the production of fifteen years running, starting with the year 1951 up to the year 1965, inclusive
With deep esteem,

Concerning Marxism in Linguistics
A group of younger comrades have asked me to give
my opinion in the press on problems relating to linguistics, particularly
in reference to Marxism in linguistics. I am not a linguistic expert and,
of course, cannot fully satisfy the request of the comrades. As to Marxism
in linguistics, as in other social sciences, this is something directly
in my field. I have therefore consented to answer a number of questions
put by the comrades.

QUESTION: Is it true that language is a superstructure
on the base?
ANSWER: No, it is not true.
The base is the economic structure of society at the given
stage of its development. The superstructure is the political, legal, religious,
artistic, philosophical views of society and the political, legal and other
institutions corresponding to them.
Every base has its own corresponding superstructure. The
base of the feudal system has its superstructure, its political, legal
and other views, and the corresponding institutions; the capitalist base
has its own superstructure, so has the socialist base. If the base changes
or is eliminated, then, following this, its superstructure changes or is
eliminated; if a new base arises, then, following this, a superstructure
arises corresponding to it.
In this respect language radically differs from the superstructure.
Take, for example, Russian society and the Russian language. In the course
of the past thirty years the old, capitalist base has been eliminated in
Russia and a new, socialist base has been built. Correspondingly, the superstructure
on the capitalist base has been eliminated and a new superstructure created
corresponding to the socialist base. The old political, legal and other
institutions, consequently, have been supplanted by new, socialist institutions.
But in spite of this the Russian language has remained basically what it
was before the October Revolution.
What has changed in the Russian language in this period?
To a certain extent the vocabulary of the Russian language has changed,
in the sense that it has been replenished with a considerable number of
new words and expressions, which have arisen in connection with the rise
of the new socialist production, the appearance of a new state, a new socialist
culture, new social relations and morals, and, lastly, in connection with
the development of technology and science; a number of words and expressions
have changed their meaning, have acquired a new signification; a number
of obsolete words have dropped out of the vocabulary. As to the basic stock
of words and the grammatical system of the Russian language, which constitute
the foundation of a language, they, after the elimination of the capitalist
base, far from having been eliminated and supplanted by a new basic word
stock and a new grammatical system of the language, have been preserved
in their entirety and have not undergone any serious changes -- they have
been preserved precisely as the foundation of the modern Russian language.
Further, the superstructure is a product of the base, but
this by no means implies that it merely reflects the base, that it is passive,
neutral, indifferent to the fate of its base, to the fate of the classes,
to the character of the system. On the contrary, having come into being,
it becomes an exceedingly active force, actively assisting its base to
take shape and consolidate itself, and doing its utmost to help the new
system to finish off and eliminate the old base and the old classes.
It cannot be otherwise. The superstructure is created by
the base precisely in order to serve it, to actively help it to take shape
and consolidate itself, to actively fight for the elimination of the old,
moribund base together with its old superstructure. The superstructure
has only to renounce this role of auxiliary, it has only to pass from a
position of active defense of its base to one of indifference towards it,
to adopt an equal attitude to all classes, and it loses its virtue and
ceases to be a superstructure.
In this respect language radically differs from the superstructure.
Language is not a product of one or another base, old or new, within the
given society, but of the whole course of the history of the society and
of the history of the bases for many centuries. It was created not by some
one class, but by the entire society, by all the classes of the society,
by the efforts of hundreds of generations. It was created for the satisfaction
of the needs not of one particular class, but of the entire society, of
all the classes of the society. Precisely for this reason it was created
as a single language for the society, common to all members of that society,
as the common language of the whole people. Hence the functional role of
language, as a means of intercourse between people, consists not in serving
one class to the detriment of other classes, but in equally serving the
entire society, all the classes of society. This in fact explains why a
language may equally serve both the old, moribund system and the new, rising
system; both the old base and the new base; both the exploiters and the
exploited.
It is no secret to anyone that the Russian language served
Russian capitalism and Russian bourgeois culture before the October Revolution
just as well as it now serves the socialist system and socialist culture
of Russian society.
The same must be said of the Ukrainian, Byelorussian, Uzbek,
Kazakh, Georgian, Armenian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Moldavian, Tatar,
Azerbaijanian, Bashkirian, Turkmenian and other languages of the Soviet
nations; they served the old, bourgeois system of these nations just as
well as they serve the new, socialist system.
It cannot be otherwise. Language exists, language has been
created precisely in order to serve society as a whole, as a means of intercourse
between people, in order to be common to the members of society and constitute
the single language of society, serving members of society equally, irrespective
of their class status. A language has only to depart from this position
of being a language common to the whole people, it has only to give preference
and support to some one social group to the detriment of other social groups
of the society, and it loses its virtue, ceases to be a means of intercourse
between the people of the society, and becomes the jargon of some social
group, degenerates and is doomed to disappear.
In this respect, while it differs in principle from the superstructure,
language does not differ from instruments of production, from machines,
let us say, which are as indifferent to classes as is language and may,
like it, equally serve a capitalist system and a socialist system.
Further, the superstructure is the product of one epoch, the epoch in which the given economic base exists and operates. The superstructure is therefore short-lived; it is eliminated and disappears with the elimination and disappearance of the given base.
Language, on the contrary, is the product of a whole number
of epochs, in the course of which it takes shape, is enriched, develops
and is smoothened. A language therefore lives immeasurably longer than
any base or any superstructure. This in fact explains why the rise and
elimination not only of one base and its superstructure, but of several
bases and their corresponding superstructures, have not led in history
to the elimination of a given language, to the elimination of its structure
and the rise of a new language with a new stock of words and a new grammatical
system.
It is more than a hundred years since Pushkin died. In this
period the feudal system and the capitalist system were eliminated in Russia,
and a third, a socialist system has arisen. Hence two bases, with their
superstructures, were eliminated, and a new, socialist base has arisen,
with its new superstructure. Yet, if we take the Russian language, for
example, it has not in this long span of time undergone any fundamental
change, and the modern Russian language differs very little in structure
from the language of Pushkin.
What has changed in the Russian language in this period?
The Russian vocabulary has in this period been greatly replenished; a large
number of obsolete words have dropped out of the vocabulary; the meaning
of a great many words has changed; the grammatical system of the language
has improved. As to the structure of Pushkin's language, with its grammatical
system and its basic stock of words, in all essentials it has remained
as the basis of modern Russian.
And this is quite understandable. Indeed, what necessity
is there, after every revolution, for the existing structure of the language,
its grammatical system and basic stock of words to be destroyed and supplanted
by new ones, as is usually the case with the superstructure? What object
would there be in calling "water," "earth," "mountain," "forest," "fish,"
"man," "to walk," "to do," "to produce," "to trade," etc., not water, earth,
mountain, etc., but something else? What object would there be in having
the modification of words in a language and the combination of words in
sentences follow not the existing grammar, but some entirely different
grammar? What would the revolution gain from such an upheaval in language?
History in general never does anything of any importance without some special
necessity for it. What, one asks, can be the necessity for such a linguistic
revolution, if it has been demonstrated that the existing language and
its structure are fundamentally quite suited to the needs of the new system?
The old superstructure can and should be destroyed and replaced by a new
one in the course of a few years, in order to give free scope for the development
of the productive forces of society; but how can an existing language be
destroyed and a new one built in its place in the course of a few years
without causing anarchy in social life and without creating the threat
of the disintegration of society? Who but a Don Quixote could set himself
such a task?
Lastly, one other radical distinction between the superstructure
and language. The superstructure is not directly connected with production,
with man's productive activity. It is connected with production only indirectly,
through the economy, through the base. The superstructure therefore reflects
changes in the level of development of the productive forces not immediately
and not directly, but only after changes in the base, through the prism
of the changes wrought in the base by the changes in production. This means
that the sphere of action of the superstructure is narrow and restricted.
Language, on the contrary, is connected with man's productive
activity directly, and not only with man's productive activity, but with
all his other activity in all his spheres of work, from production to the
base, and from the base to the superstructure. For this reason language
reflects changes in production immediately and directly, without waiting
for changes in the base. For this reason the sphere of action of language,
which embraces all fields of man's activity, is far broader and more comprehensive
than the sphere of action of the superstructure. More, it is practically
unlimited.
It is this that primarily explains why language, or rather
its vocabulary, is in a state of almost constant change. The continuous
development of industry and agriculture, of trade and transport, of technology
and science, demands that language should replenish its vocabulary with
new words and expressions needed for their functioning. And language, directly
reflecting these needs, does replenish its vocabulary with new words, and
perfects its grammatical system.
Hence:
a) A Marxist cannot regard language as a superstructure
on the base; b) To confuse language and superstructure is to commit
a serious error.

QUESTION: Is it true that language always was and is
class language, that there is no such thing as language which is the single
and common language of a society, a non-class language common to the whole
people.
ANSWER: No, it is not true.
It is not difficult to understand that in a society which
has no classes there can be no such thing as a class language. There were
no classes in the primitive communal clan system, and consequently there
could be no class language -- the language was then the single and common
language of the whole community. The objection that the concept class should
be taken as covering every human community, including the primitive communal
community, is not an objection but a playing with words that is not worth
refuting.

As to the subsequent development from clan languages to tribal
languages, from tribal languages to the languages of nationalities, and
from the languages of nationalities to national languages -- everywhere
and at all stages of development, language, as a means of intercourse between
the people of a society, was the common and single language of that society,
serving its members equally, irrespective of their social status.


I am not referring here to the empires of the slave and mediaeval
periods, the empires of Cyrus or Alexander the Great, let us say, or of
Caesar or Charles the Great, which had no economic foundations of their
own and were transient and unstable military and administrative associations.
Not only did these empires not have, they could not have had a single language
common to the whole empire and understood by all the members of the empire.
They were conglomerations of tribes and nationalities, each of which lived
its own life and had its own language. Consequently, it is not these or
similar empires I have in mind, but the tribes and nationalities composing
them, which had their own economic foundations and their own languages,
evolved in the distant past. History tells us that the languages of these
tribes and nationalities were not class languages, but languages common
to the whole of a tribe or nationality, and understood by all its people.


Side by side with this, there were, of course, dialects,
local vernaculars, but they were dominated by and subordinated to the single
and common language of the tribe or nationality.


Later, with the appearance of capitalism, the elimination
of feudal division and the formation of national markets, nationalities
developed into nations, and the languages of nationalities into national
languages. History shows that national languages are not class, but common
languages, common to all the members of each nation and constituting the
single language of that nation.


It has been said above that language, as a means of intercourse
between the people of a society, serves all classes of society equally,
and in this respect displays what may be called an indifference to classes.
But people, the various social groups, the classes, are far from being
indifferent to language. They strive to utilize the language in their own
interests, to impose their own special lingo, their own special terms,
their own special expressions upon it. The upper strata of the propertied
classes, who have divorced themselves from and detest the people -- the
aristocratic nobility, the upper strata of the bourgeoisie -- particularly
distinguish themselves in this respect. "Class" dialects, jargons, high-society
"languages" are created. These dialects and jargons are often incorrectly
referred to in literature as languages -- the "aristocratic language" or
the "bourgeois language" in contradistinction to the "proletarian language"
or the "peasant language." For this reason, strange as it may seem, some
of our comrades have come to the conclusion that national language is a
fiction, and that only class languages exist in reality.


There is nothing, I think, more erroneous than this conclusion.
Can These dialects and jargons be regarded as languages? Certainly not.
They cannot, firstly, because these dialects and jargons have no grammatical
systems or basic word stocks of their own -- they borrow them from the
national language. They cannot, secondly, because these dialects and jargons
are confined to a narrow sphere, are current only among the upper strata
of a given class and are entirely unsuitable as a means of human intercourse
for society as a whole. What, then, have they? They have a collection of
specific words reflecting the specific tastes of the aristocracy or the
upper strata of the bourgeoisie; a certain number of expressions and turns
of phrase distinguished by refinement and gallantry and free of the "coarse"
expressions and turns of phrase of the national language; lastly, a certain
number of foreign words. But all the fundamentals, that is, the overwhelming
majority of the words and the grammatical system, are borrowed from the
common, national language. Dialects and jargons are therefore offshoots
of the common national language, devoid of all linguistic independence
and doomed to stagnation. To believe that dialects and jargons can develop
into independent languages capable of ousting and supplanting the national
language means losing one's sense of historical perspective and abandoning
the Marxist position.


References are made to Marx, and the passage from his article
St. Max is quoted which says that the bourgeois have "their own language,"
that this language "is a product of the bourgeoisie" [2]
that it is permeated with the spirit of mercantilism and huckstering. Certain
comrades cite this passage with the idea of proving that Marx believed
in the "class character" of language and denied the existence of a single
national language. If these comrades were impartial, they should have cited
another passage from this same article St. Max, where Marx, touching on
the ways single national languages arose, speaks of "the concentration
of dialects into a single national language resulting from economic and
political concentration." [3]


Marx, consequently, did recognize the necessity of a single
national language, as a higher form, to which dialects, as lower forms,
are subordinate.


What, then, can this bourgeois language be which Marx says
"is a product of the bourgeoisie"? Did Marx consider it as much a language
as the national language, with a specific linguistic structure of its own?
Could he have considered it such a language? Of course, not. Marx merely
wanted to say that the bourgeois had polluted the single national language
with their hucksters' lingo, that the bourgeois, in other words, have their
hucksters' jargon.


It thus appears that these comrades have misrepresented Marx.
And they misrepresented him because they quoted Marx not like Marxists
but like dogmatists, without delving into the essence of the matter.


References arc made to Engels, and the words from his The
Condition of the Working Class in England are cited where he says that
in Britain "...the working class has gradually become a race wholly apart
from the English bourgeoisie," that "the workers speak other dialects,
have other thoughts and ideals, other customs and moral principles, a different
religion and other politics than those of the bourgeoisie." [4]
Certain comrades conclude from this passage that Engels denied the necessity
of a common, national language, that he believed, consequently, in the
"class character" of language. True, Engels speaks here of dialects, not
languages, fully realizing that, being an offshoot of the national language,
a dialect cannot supplant the national language. But apparently, These
comrades regard the existence of a difference between a language and a
dialect with no particular enthusiasm.


It is obvious that the quotation is inappropriate, because
Engels here speaks not of "class languages" but chiefly of class thoughts,
ideals, customs, moral principles, religion, politics. It is perfectly
true that the thoughts, ideals, customs, moral principles, religion and
politics of bourgeois and proletarians are directly antithetical. But what
has this to do with national language, or the "class character" of language?
Can the existence of class antagonisms in society serve as an argument
in favor of the "class character" of language, or against the necessity
of a single national language? Marxism says that a common language is one
of the cardinal earmarks of a nation, although knowing very well that there
are class antagonisms within the nation. Do the comrades referred to recognize
this Marxist thesis?


References are made to Lafargue, [5] and
it is said that in his pamphlet The French Language Before and After the
Revolution he recognizes the "class character" of language and denies the
necessity of a national language common to the whole people. That is not
true. Lafargue does indeed speak of a "noble" or "aristocratic language"
and of the "jargons" of various strata of society. But these comrades forget
that Lafargue, who was not interested in the difference between languages
and jargons and referred to dialects now as "artificial languages," now
as "jargons," definitely says in this pamphlet that "the artificial language
which distinguished the aristocracy . . . arose out of the language common
to the whole people, which was spoken both by bourgeois and artisan, by
town and country."


Consequently, Lafargue recognizes the existence and necessity
of a common language of the whole people, and fully realizes that the "aristocratic
language" and other dialects and jargons are subordinate to and dependent
on the language common to the whole people.


It follows that the reference to Lafargue is wide of the
mark.


References are made to the fact that at one time in England
the feudal lords spoke "for centuries" in French, while the English people
spoke English, and this is alleged to be an argument in favor of the "class
character" of language and against the necessity of a language common to
the whole people. But this is not an argument, it is rather an anecdote.
Firstly, not all the feudal lords spoke French at that time, but only a
small upper stratum of English feudal lords attached to the court and at
county seats. Secondly, it was not some "class language" they spoke, but
the ordinary language common to all the French people. Thirdly, we know
that in the course of time this French language fad disappeared without
a trace, yielding place to the English language common to the whole people.
Do these comrades think that the English feudal lords "for centuries" held
intercourse with the English people through interpreters, that they did
not use the English language, that there was no language common to all
the English at that time, and that the French language in England was then
anything more than the language of high society, current only in the restricted
circle of the upper English aristocracy? How can one possibly deny the
existence and the necessity of a language common to the whole people on
the basis of anecdote "arguments" like these?


There was a time when Russian aristocrats at the tsar's court
and in high society also made a fad of the French language. They prided
themselves on the fact that when they spoke Russian they often lapsed into
French, that they could only speak Russian with a French accent. Does this
mean that there was no Russian language common to the whole people at that
time in Russia, that a language common to the whole people was a fiction,
and "class languages" a reality?


Our comrades are here committing at least two mistakes.


The first mistake is that they confuse language with superstructure.
They think that since the superstructure has a class character, language
too must be a class language, and not a language common to the whole people.
But I have already said that language and superstructure are two different
concepts, and that a Marxist must not confuse them.


The second mistake of these comrades is that they conceive
the opposition of interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the
fierce class struggle between them, as meaning the disintegration of society,
as a break of all ties between the hostile classes. They believe that,
since society has disintegrated and there is no longer a single society,
but only classes, a single language of society, a national language, is
unnecessary. If society has disintegrated and there is no longer a language
common to the whole people, a national language, what remains? There remain
classes and "class languages." Naturally, every "class language" will have
its "class" grammar -- a "proletarian" grammar or a "bourgeois" grammar.
True, such grammars do not exist anywhere. But that does not worry these
comrades: they believe that such grammars will appear in due course.


At one time there were "Marxists" in our country who asserted
that the railways left to us after the October Revolution were bourgeois
railways, that it would be unseemly for us Marxists to use them, that they
should be torn up and new, "proletarian" railways built. For this they
were nicknamed "troglodytes".


It goes without saying that such a primitive-anarchist view
of society, of classes, of language has nothing in common with Marxism.
But it undoubtedly exists and continues to prevail in the minds of certain
of our muddled comrades.


It is of course wrong to say that, because of the existence
of a fierce class struggle, society has split up into classes which are
no longer economically connected with one another in one society. On the
contrary, as long as capitalism exists, the bourgeois and the proletarians
will be bound together by every economic thread as parts of a single capitalist
society. The bourgeois cannot live and enrich themselves unless they have
wage-laborers at their command; the proletarians cannot survive unless
they hire themselves to the capitalists. If all economic ties between them
were to cease, it would mean the cessation of all production, and the cessation
of all production would mean the doom of society, the doom of the classes
themselves. Naturally, no class wants to incur self-destruction. Consequently,
however sharp the class struggle may be, it cannot lead to the disintegration
of society. Only ignorance of Marxism and complete failure to understand
the nature of language could have suggested to some of our comrades the
fairy-tale about the disintegration of society, about "class" languages,
and "class" grammars.


Reference is further made to Lenin, and it is pointed out
that Lenin recognized the existence of two cultures under capitalism --
bourgeois and proletarian -- and that the slogan of national culture under
capitalism is a nationalist slogan. All this is true and Lenin is absolutely
right here. But what has this to do with the "class character" of language?
When these comrades refer to what Lenin said about two cultures under capitalism,
it is evidently with the idea of suggesting to the reader that the existence
of two cultures, bourgeois and proletarian, in society means that there
must also be two languages, inasmuch as language is linked with culture
-- and, consequently, that Lenin denies the necessity of a single national
language, and, consequently, that Lenin believes in "class" languages.
The mistake these comrades make here is that they identify and confuse
language with culture. But culture and language are two different things.
Culture may be bourgeois or socialist, but language, as a means of intercourse,
is always a language common to the whole people and can serve both bourgeois
and socialist culture. Is it not a fact that the Russian, the Ukrainian,
the Uzbek languages are now serving the socialist culture of these nations
just as well as they served their bourgeois cultures before the October
Revolution? Consequently, these comrades are profoundly mistaken when they
assert that the existence of two different cultures leads to the formation
of two different languages and to the negation of the necessity of a single
language.


When Lenin spoke of two cultures, he proceeded precisely
from the thesis that the existence of two cultures cannot lend to the negation
of a single language and to the formation of two languages, that there
must be a single language. When the Bundists [6] accused
Lenin of denying the necessity of a national language and of regarding
culture as "non-national," Lenin, as we know, vigorously protested and
declared that he was fighting against bourgeois culture, and not against
national languages, the necessity of which he regarded as indisputable.
It is strange that some of our comrades should be trailing in the footsteps
of the Bundists.


As to a single language, the necessity of which Lenin is
alleged to deny, it would be well to pay heed to the following words of
Lenin:



"Language is the most important means of human intercourse. Unity
of language and its unimpeded development form one of the most important
conditions for genuinely free and extensive commercial intercourse appropriate
to modern capitalism, for a free and broad grouping of the population in
all its separate classes." [7]


It follows that our highly respected comrades have misrepresented
the views of Lenin.


Reference, lastly, is made to Stalin. The passage from Stalin
is quoted which says that "the bourgeoisie and its nationalist parties
were and remain in this period the chief directing force of such nations."
8 This is all true. The bourgeoisie and its nationalist party really do
direct bourgeois culture, just as the proletariat and its internationalist
party direct proletarian culture. But what has this to do with the "class
character" of language? Do not these comrades know that national language
is a form of national culture, that a national language may serve both
bourgeois and socialist culture? Are our comrades unaware of the well-known
formula of the Marxists that the present Russian, Ukrainian, Byelorussian
and other cultures arc socialist in content and national in form, i.e.,
in language? Do they agree with this Marxist formula?


The mistake our comrades commit here is that they do not
see the difference between culture and language, and do not understand
that culture changes in content with every new period in the development
of society, whereas language remains basically the same through a number
of periods, equally serving both the new culture and the old.


Hence:



a) Language, as a means of intercourse, always was and remains
the single language of a society, common to all its members; b) The existence of dialects and jargons does not negate but confirms the existence of a language common to the whole of the given people, of which they are offshoots and to which they are subordinate; c) The "class character" of language formula is erroneous
and non-Marxist.



QUESTION: What are the characteristic features of language?


ANSWER: Language is one of those social phenomena
which operate throughout the existence of a society. It arises and develops
with the rise and development of a society. It dies when the society dies.
Apart from society there is no language. Accordingly, language and its
laws of development can be understood only if studied in inseparable connection
with the history of society, with the history of the people to whom the
language under study belongs, and who are its creators and repositories.


Language is a medium, an instrument with the help of which
people communicate with one another, exchange thoughts and understand each
other. Being directly connected with thinking, language registers and fixes
in words, and in words combined into sentences, the results of the process
of thinking and achievements of man's cognitive activity, and thus makes
possible the exchange of thoughts in human society.


Exchange of thoughts is a constant and vital necessity, for
without it, it is impossible to co-ordinate the joint actions of people
in the struggle against the forces of nature, in the struggle to produce
the necessary material values; without it, it is impossible to ensure the
success of society's productive activity, and, hence, the very existence
of social production becomes impossible. Consequently, without a language
understood by a society and common to all its members, that society must
cease to produce, must disintegrate and cease to exist as a society. In
this sense, language, while it is a medium of intercourse, is at the same
time an instrument of struggle and development of society.


As we know, all the words in a language taken together constitute
what is known as its vocabulary. The chief thing in the vocabulary of a
language is its basic stock of words, which includes also all the root
words, as its kernel. It is far less extensive than the language's vocabulary,
but it persists for a very long time, for centuries, and provides the language
with a basis for the formation of new words. The vocabulary reflects the
state of the language: the richer and more diversified the vocabulary,
the richer and more developed the language.


However, by itself, the vocabulary does not constitute the
language -- it is rather the building material of the language. Just as
in construction work the building materials do not constitute the building,
although the latter cannot be constructed without them, so too the vocabulary
of a language does not constitute the language itself, although no language
is conceivable without it. But the vocabulary of a language assumes tremendous
importance when it comes under the control of grammar, which defines the
rules governing the modification of words and the combination of words
into sentences, and thus makes the language a coherent and significant
function. Grammar (morphology, syntax) is the collection of rules governing
the modification of words and their combination into sentences. It is therefore
thanks to grammar that it becomes possible for language to invest man's
thoughts in a material linguistic integument.


The distinguishing feature of grammar is that it gives rules
for the modification of words not in reference to concrete words, but to
words in general, not taken concretely; that it gives rules for the formation
of sentences not in reference to particular concrete sentences -- with,
let us say, a concrete subject, a concrete predicate, etc. -- but to all
sentences in general, irrespective of the concrete form of any sentence
in particular. Hence, abstracting itself, as regards both words and sentences,
from the particular and concrete, grammar takes that which is common and
basic in the modification of words and their combination into sentences
and builds it into grammatical rules, grammatical laws. Grammar is the
outcome of a process of abstraction performed by the human mind over a
long period of time; it is an indication of the tremendous achievement
of thought.


In this respect grammar resembles geometry, which in giving
its laws abstracts itself from concrete objects, regarding objects as bodies
devoid of concreteness, and defining the relations between them not as
the concrete relations of concrete objects but as the relations of bodies
in general, devoid of all concreteness.


Unlike the superstructure, which is connected with production
not directly, but through the economy, language is directly connected with
man's productive activity, as well as with all his other activity in all
his spheres of work without exception. That is why the vocabulary of a
language, being the most sensitive to change, is in a state of almost constant
change, and, unlike the superstructure, language does not have to wait
until the base is eliminated, but makes changes in its vocabulary before
the base is eliminated and irrespective of the state of the base.


However, the vocabulary of a language does not change in
the way the superstructure does, that is, by abolishing the old and building
something new, but by replenishing the existing vocabulary with new words
which arise with changes in the social system, with the development of
production, of culture, science, etc. Moreover, although a certain number
of obsolete words usually drop out of the vocabulary of a language, a far
larger number of new words are added. As to the basic word stock, it is
preserved in all its fundamentals and is used as the basis for the vocabulary
of the language.


This is quite understandable. There is no necessity to destroy
the basic word stock when it can be effectively used through the course
of several historical periods; not to speak of the fact that, it being
impossible to create a new basic word stock in a short time, the destruction
of the basic word stock accumulated in the course of centuries would result
in paralysis of the language, in the complete disruption of intercourse
between people.


The grammatical system of a language changes even more slowly
than its basic word stock. Elaborated in the course of epochs, and having
become part of the flesh and blood or the language, the grammatical system
changes still more slowly than the basic word stock. With the lapse of
time it, of course, undergoes changes, becomes more perfected, improves
its rules, makes them more specific and acquires new rules; but the fundamentals
of the grammatical system are preserved for a very long time, since, as
history shows, they are able to serve society effectively through a succession
of epochs.


Hence, grammatical system and basic word stock constitute
the foundation of language, the essence of its specific character.


History shows that languages possess great stability and
a tremendous power of resistance to forcible assimilation. Some historians,
instead of explaining this phenomenon, confine themselves to expressing
their surprise at it. But there is no reason for surprise whatsoever. Languages
owe their stability to the stability of their grammatical systems and basic
word stocks. The Turkish assimilators strove for hundreds of years to mutilate,
shatter and destroy the languages of the Balkan peoples. During this period
the vocabulary of the Balkan languages underwent considerable change; quite
a few Turkish words and expressions were absorbed; there were "convergencies"
and "divergencies." Nevertheless, the Balkan languages held their own and
survived. Why? Because their grammatical systems and basic word stocks
were in the main preserved.


It follows from all this that a language, its structure,
cannot be regarded as the product of some one epoch. The structure of a
language, its grammatical system and basic word stock, is the product of
a number of epochs.


We may assume that the rudiments of modern language already
existed in hoary antiquity, before the epoch of slavery. It was a rather
simple language, with a very meager stock of words, but with a grammatical
system of its own -- true, a primitive one, but a grammatical system nonetheless.


The further development of production, the appearance of
classes, the introduction of writing, the rise of the state, which needed
a more or less well-regulated correspondence for its administration, the
development of trade, which needed a well-regulated correspondence still
more, the appearance of the printing press, the development of literature
-- all this caused big changes in the development of language. During this
time, tribes and nationalities broke up and scattered, intermingled and
intercrossed; later there arose national languages and states, revolutions
took place, and old social systems were replaced by new ones. All this
caused even greater changes in language and its development.


However, it would be a profound mistake to think that language
developed in the way the superstructure developed -- by the destruction
of that which existed and the building of something new. In point of fact,
languages did not develop by the destruction of existing languages and
the creation of new ones, but by extending and perfecting the basic elements
of existing languages. And the transition of the language from one quality
to another did not take the form of an explosion, of the destruction at
one blow of the old and the creation of the new, but of the gradual and
long-continued accumulation of the elements of the new quality, of the
new linguistic structure, and the gradual dying away of the elements of
the old quality.


It is said that the theory that languages develop by stages
is a Marxist theory, since it recognizes the necessity of sudden explosions
as a condition for the transition of a language from an old quality to
a new. This is of course untrue, for it is difficult to find anything resembling
Marxism in this theory.


And if the theory of stages really does recognize sudden
explosions in the history of the development of languages, so much the
worse for that theory. Marxism does not recognize sudden explosions in
the development of languages, the sudden death of an existing language
and the sudden erection of a new language. Lafargue was wrong when he spoke
of a "sudden linguistic revolution which took place between 1789 and 1794"
in France (see Lafargue's pamphlet The French Language Before and After
the Revolution). There was no linguistic revolution, let alone a sudden
one, in France at that time. True enough, during that period the vocabulary
of the French language was replenished with new words and expressions,
a certain number of obsolete words dropped out of it, and the meaning of
certain words changed -- but that was all. Changes of this nature, however,
by no means determine the destiny of a language. The chief thing in a language
is its grammatical system and basic word stock. But far from disappearing
in the period of the French bourgeois revolution, the grammatical system
and basic word stock of the French language were preserved without substantial
change, and not only were they preserved, but they continue to exist in
the French language of to-day. I need hardly say that five or six years
is a ridiculously small period for the elimination of an existing language
and the building of a new national language ("a sudden linguistic revolution"!)
-- centuries are needed for this.


Marxism holds that the transition of a language from an old
quality to a new does not take place by way of an explosion, of the destruction
of an existing language and the creation of a new one, but by the gradual
accumulation of the elements of the new quality, and hence by the gradual
dying away of the elements of the old quality.


It should be said in general for the benefit of comrades
who have an infatuation for explosions that the law of transition from
an old quality to a new by means of an explosion is inapplicable not only
to the history of the development of languages; it is not always applicable
to other social phenomena of a basis or superstructural character. It applies
of necessity to a society divided into hostile classes. But it does not
necessarily apply to a society which has no hostile classes. In a period
of eight to ten years we effected a transition in the agriculture of our
country from the bourgeois, individual-peasant system to the socialist,
collective-farm system. This was a revolution which eliminated the old
bourgeois economic system in the countryside and created a new, socialist
system. But that revolution did not take place by means of an explosion,
that is, by the overthrow of the existing government power and the creation
of a new power, but by a gradual transition from the old bourgeois system
in the countryside to a new system. And it was possible to do that because
it was a revolution from above, because the revolution was accomplished
on the initiative of the existing power with the support of the bulk of
the peasantry.


It is said that the numerous instances of linguistic crossing
in past history furnish reason to believe that when languages cross a new
language is formed by means of an explosion, by a sudden transition from
an old quality to a new. This is quite wrong.


Linguistic crossing cannot be regarded as the single impact
of a decisive blow which produces its results within a few years. Linguistic
crossing is a prolonged process which continues for hundreds of years.
There can therefore be no question of explosion here.


Further, it would be quite wrong to think that the crossing
of, say, two languages results in a new, third language which does not
resemble either of the languages crossed and differs qualitatively from
both of them. As a matter of fact one of the languages usually emerges
victorious from the cross retains its grammatical system and its basic
word stock and continues to develop in accordance with its inherent laws
of development, while the other language gradually loses its quality and
gradually dies away.


Consequently, a cross does not result in some new, third
language; one of the languages persists, retains its grammatical system
and basic word stock and is able to develop in accordance with its inherent
laws of development.


True, in the process the vocabulary of the victorious language
is somewhat enriched from the vanquished language, but this strengthens
rather than weakens it.


Such was the case, for instance, with the Russian language,
with which, in the course of historical development, the languages of a
number of other peoples crossed and which always emerged the victor.


Of course, in the process the vocabulary of the Russian language
was enlarged at the expense of the vocabularies of the other languages,
but far from weakening, this enriched and strengthened the Russian language.


As to the specific national individuality of the Russian
language, it did not suffer in the slightest, because the Russian language
preserved its grammatical system and basic word stock and continued to
advance and perfect itself in accordance with its inherent laws of development.


There can be no doubt that the crossing theory has little
or no value for Soviet linguistics. If it is true that the chief task of
linguistics is to study the inherent laws of language development, it has
to be admitted that the crossing theory does not even set itself this task,
let alone accomplish it -- it simply does not notice it, or does not understand
it.



QUESTION: Did Pravda act rightly in starting an open
discussion on problems of linguistics?


ANSWER: Yes, it did.


Along what lines the problems of linguistics will be settled,
will become clear at the conclusion of the discussion. But it may be said
already that the discussion has been very useful.


It has brought out, in the first place, that in linguistic
bodies both in the center and in the republics a regime has prevailed which
is alien to science and men of science. The slightest criticism of the
state of affairs in Soviet linguistics, even the most timid attempt to
criticize the so-called "new doctrine" in linguistics, was persecuted and
suppressed by the leading linguistic circles. Valuable workers and researchers
in linguistics were dismissed from their posts or demoted for being critical
of N. Y. Marr's heritage or expressing the slightest disapproval of his
teachings. Linguistic scholars were appointed to leading posts not on their
merits, but because of their unqualified acceptance of N. Y. Marr's theories.


It is generally recognized that no science can develop and
flourish without a battle of opinions, without freedom of criticism. But
this generally recognized rule was ignored and flouted in the most unceremonious
fashion. There arose a close group of infallible leaders, who, having secured
themselves against any possible criticism, became a law unto themselves
and did whatever they pleased.


To give one example: the so-called "Baku Course" (lectures
delivered by N. Y. Marr in Baku), which the author himself had rejected
and forbidden to be republished, was republished nevertheless by order
of this leading caste (Comrade Meshchaninov calls them "disciples" of N.
Y. Marr) and included without any reservations in the list of text-books
recommended to students. This means that the students were deceived a rejected
"Course" being suggested to them as a sound textbook. If I were not convinced
of the integrity of Comrade Meshchaninov and the other linguistic leaders,
I would say that such conduct is tantamount to sabotage.


How could this have happened? It happened because the Arakcheyev
regime [9] established in linguistics cultivates irresponsibility
and encourages such arbitrary actions.


The discussion has proved to be very useful first of all
because it brought this Arakcheyev regime into the light of day and smashed
it to smithereens.


But the usefulness of the discussion does not end there.
It not only smashed the old regime in linguistics but also brought out
the incredible confusion of ideas on cardinal questions of linguistics
which prevails among the leading circles in this branch of science. Until
the discussion began the "disciples" of N. Y. Marr kept silence and glossed
over the unsatisfactory state of affairs in linguistics. But when the discussion
started silence became impossible, and they were compelled to express their
opinion in the press. And what did we find? It turned out that in N. Y.
Marr's teachings there are a whole number of defects, errors, ill-defined
problems and sketchy propositions. Why, one asks, have N. Y. Marr's "disciples"
begun to talk about this only now, after the discussion opened? Why did
they not see to it before? Why did they not speak about it in due time
openly and honestly, as befits scientists?


Having admitted "some" errors of N. Y. Marr, his "disciples,"
it appears, think that Soviet linguistics can only be advanced on the basis
of a "rectified" version of N. Y. Marr's theory, which they consider a
Marxist one. No, save us from N. Y. Marr's "Marxism"! N. Y. Marr did indeed
want to be, and endeavored to be, a Marxist, but he failed to become one.
He was nothing but a simplifier and vulgarizer of Marxism, similar to the
"proletcultists" or the "Rappists."


N. Y. Marr introduced into linguistics the incorrect, non-Marxist
formula that language is a superstructure, and got himself into a muddle
and put linguistics into a muddle. Soviet linguistics cannot be advanced
on the basis of an incorrect formula.


N. Y. Marr introduced into linguistics another and also incorrect
and non-Marxist formula, regarding the "class character" of language, and
got himself into a muddle and put linguistics into a muddle. Soviet linguistics
cannot be advanced on the basis of an incorrect formula which is contrary
to the whole course of the history of peoples and languages.


N. Y. Marr introduced into linguistics an immodest, boastful,
arrogant tone alien to Marxism and tending towards a bald and off-hand
negation of everything done in linguistics prior to N. Y. Marr.


N. Y. Marr shrilly abused the comparative-historical method
as "idealistic." Yet it must be said that, despite its serious shortcomings,
the comparative-historical method is nevertheless better than N. Y. Marr's
really idealistic four-element analysis, [10] because
the former gives a stimulus to work, to a study of languages, while the
latter only gives a stimulus to loll in one's arm-chair and tell fortunes
in the tea-cup of the celebrated four elements.


N. Y. Marr haughtily discountenanced every attempt to study
groups (families) of languages on the grounds that it was a manifestation
of the "proto-language" theory. [11] Yet it cannot be
denied that the linguistic affinity of nations like the Slav nations, say,
is beyond question, and that a study of the linguistic affinity of these
nations might be of great value to linguistics in the study of the laws
of language development. The "proto-language" theory, I need hardly say,
has nothing to do with it.


To listen to N. Y. Marr, and especially to his "disciples,"
one might think that prior to N. Y. Marr there was no such thing as the
science of language, that the science of language appeared with the "new
doctrine" of N. Y. Marr. Marx and Engels were much more modest: they held
that their dialectical materialism was a product of the development of
the sciences, including philosophy, in earlier periods.


Thus, the discussion was useful also because it brought to
light ideological shortcomings in Soviet linguistics.


I think that the sooner our linguistics rids itself of N.
Y. Marr's errors, the sooner will it be possible to extricate it from its
present crisis.


Elimination of the Arakcheyev regime in linguistics, rejection
of N. Y. Marr's errors, and the introduction of Marxism into linguistics
-- that, in my opinion, is the way in which Soviet linguistics could be
put on a sound basis.


Pravda, June 20, 1950


Concerning Certain Problems of Linguistics
Reply to Comrade E. Krasheninnikova
Comrade Krasheninnikova,
I am answering your questions.
QUESTION: Your article convincingly shows that language is neither
the base nor the superstructure. Would it be right to regard language as
a phenomenon characteristic of both the base and the superstructure, or
would it be more correct to regard language as an intermediate phenomenon?
ANSWER: Of course, characteristic of language, as
a social phenomenon, is that common feature which is inherent in all social
phenomena, including the base and the superstructure, namely: it serves
society just as society is served by all other social phenomena, including
the base and the superstructure. But this, properly speaking, exhausts
that common feature which is inherent in all social phenomena. Beyond this,
important distinctions begin between social phenomena.

The point is that social phenomena have, in addition to this
common feature, their own specific features which distinguish them from
each other and which are of primary importance for science. The specific
features of the base consist in that it serves society economically. The
specific features of the superstructure consist in that it serves society
by means of political, legal, aesthetic and other ideas and provides society
with corresponding political, legal and other institutions. What then are
the specific features of language, distinguishing it from other social
phenomena? They consist in that language serves society as a means of intercourse
between people, as a means for exchanging thoughts in society, as a means
enabling people to understand one another and to co-ordinate joint work
in all spheres of human activity, both in the sphere of production and
in the sphere of economic relations, both in the sphere of politics and
in the sphere of culture, both in social life and in everyday life. These
specific features are characteristic only of language, and precisely because
they are characteristic only of language, language is the object of study
by an independent science -- linguistics. If there were no such specific
features of language, linguistics would lose its right to independent existence.


In brief: language cannot be included either in the category
of bases or in the category of superstructures.


Nor can it be included in the category of "intermediate"
phenomena between the base and the superstructure, for such "intermediate"
phenomena do not exist.


But perhaps language could be included in the category of
the productive forces of society, in the category, say, of instruments
of production? Indeed, there does exist a certain analogy between language
and instruments of production: instruments of production manifest, just
as language does, a kind of indifference towards classes and can serve
equally different classes of society, both old and new. Does this circumstance
provide ground for including language in the category of instruments of
production? No, it does not.


At one time, N. Y. Marr, seeing that his formula -- "language
is a superstructure on the base" -- encountered objections, decided to
"reshape" it and announced that "language is an instrument of production."
Was N. Y. Marr right in including language in the category of instruments
of production? No, he certainly was not.


The point is that the similarity between language and instruments
of production ends with the analogy I have just mentioned. But, on the
other hand, there is a radical difference between language and instruments
of production. This difference lies in the fact that whereas instruments
of production produce material wealth, language produces nothing or "produces"
words only. To put it more plainly, people possessing instruments of production
can produce material wealth, but those very same people, if they possess
a language but not instruments of production, cannot produce material wealth.
It is not difficult to see that were language capable of producing material
wealth, wind-bags would be the richest men on earth.


QUESTION: Marx and Engels define language as "the immediate reality
of thought," as "practical,... actual consciousness.'' [12]
"Ideas," Marx says, "do not exist divorced from language." In what measure,
in your opinion, should linguistics occupy itself with the semantic aspect
of language, semantics, historical semasiology, and stylistics, or should
form alone be the subject of linguistics?


ANSWER: Semantics (semasiology) is one of the important
branches of linguistics. The semantic aspect of words and expressions is
of serious importance in the study of language. Hence, semantics (semasiology)
must be assured its due place in linguistics.


However, in working on problems of semantics and in utilizing
its data, its significance must in no way be overestimated, and still less
must it be abused. I have in mind certain philologists who, having an excessive
passion for semantics, disregard language as "the immediate reality of
thought" inseparably connected with thinking, divorce thinking from language
and maintain that language is outliving its age and that it is possible
to do without language.


Listen to what N. Y. Marr says:


"Language exists only inasmuch as it is expressed in sounds; the
action of thinking occurs also without being expressed.... Language (spoken)
has already begun to surrender its functions to the latest inventions which
are unreservedly conquering space, while thinking is on the up-grade, departing
from its unutilized accumulations in the past and its new acquisitions,
and is to oust and fully replace language. The language of the future is
thinking which will be developing in technique free of natural matter.
No language, even the spoken language, which is all the same connected
with the standards of nature, will be able to withstand it" (see Selected
Works by N. Y. Marr).


If we interpret this "labor-magic" gibberish into simple human
language, the conclusion may be drawn that:


a) N. Y. Marr divorces thinking from language; b) N. Y. Marr considers that communication between people can be realized without language, with the help of thinking itself, which is free of the "natural matter" of language, free of the "standards of nature"; c) divorcing thinking from language and "having freed" it from the "natural matter,' of language, N. Y. Marr lands into the swamp of idealism.


It is said that thoughts arise in the mind of man prior to their
being expressed in speech, that they arise without linguistic material,
without linguistic integument, in, so to say, a naked form. But that is
absolutely wrong. Whatever thoughts arise in the human mind and at whatever
moment, they can arise and exist only on the basis of the linguistic material,
on the basis of language terms and phrases. Bare thoughts, free of the
linguistic material, free of the "natural matter" of language, do not exist.
"Language is the immediate reality of thought" (Marx). The reality of thought
is manifested in language. Only idealists can speak of thinking not being
connected with "the natural matter" of language, of thinking without language.


In brief: over-estimation of semantics and abuse of it led
N. Y. Marr to idealism.


Consequently, if semantics (semasiology) is safeguarded against
exaggerations and abuses of the kind committed by N. Y. Marr and some of
his "disciples," semantics can be of great benefit to linguistics.


QUESTION: You quite justly say that the ideas, concepts, customs
and moral principles of the bourgeoisie and those of the proletariat are
directly antithetical. The class character of these phenomena is certainly
reflected in the semantic aspect of language (and sometimes in its form
-- in the vocabulary -- as is correctly pointed out in your article). In
analyzing concrete linguistic material and, in the first place, the semantic
aspect of language, can we speak of the class essence of the concepts expressed
by language, particularly in those cases when language expresses not only
the thought of man but also his attitude towards reality, where his class
affinity manifests itself with especial clarity?


ANSWER: Putting it more briefly, you want to know
whether classes influence language, whether they introduce into language
their specific words and expressions, whether there are cases when people
attach a different meaning to one and the same word or expression depending
on their class affinity?


Yes, classes influence language, introduce into the language
their own specific words and expressions and sometimes understand one and
the same word or expression differently. There is no doubt about that.


However, it does not follow that specific words and expressions,
as well as difference in semantics, can be of serious importance for the
development of a single language common to the whole people, that they
are capable of detracting from its significance or of changing its character.


Firstly, such specific words and expressions, as well as
cases of difference in semantics, are so few in language that they hardly
make up even one per cent of the entire linguistic material. Consequently,
all the remaining overwhelming mass of words and expressions, as well as
their semantics, are common to all classes of society.


Secondly, specific words and expressions with a class tinge
are used in speech not according to rules of some sort of "class" grammar,
which does not exist, but according to the grammatical rules of the existing
language common to the whole people.


Hence, the existence of specific words and expressions and
the facts of differences in the semantics of language do not refute, but,
on the contrary, confirm the existence and necessity of a single language
common to the whole people.


QUESTION: In your article you quite correctly appraise Marr as a
vulgarizer of Marxism. Does this mean that the linguists, including us,
the young linguists, should reject the whole linguistic heritage of Marr,
who all the same has to his credit a number of valuable linguistic researches
(Comrades Chikobava, Sanzheyev and others wrote about them during the discussion)?
Approaching Marr critically, cannot we take from him what is useful and
valuable?


ANSWER: Of course, the works of N. Y. Marr do not
consist solely of errors. N. Y. Marr made very gross mistakes when he introduced
into linguistics elements of Marxism in a distorted form, when he tried
to create an independent theory of language. But N. Y. Marr has certain
good and ably written works, in which he, forgetting his theoretical claims,
conscientiously and, one must say, skillfully investigates individual languages.
In these works one can find not a little that is valuable and instructive.
Clearly, these valuable and instructive things should be taken from N.
Y. Marr and utilized.
QUESTION: Many linguists consider formalism one of the main causes
of the stagnation in Soviet linguistics. We should very much like to know
your opinion as to what formalism in linguistics consists in and how it
should be overcome.
ANSWER: N. Y. Marr and his "disciples" accuse of "formalism"
all linguists who do not accept the "new doctrine" of N. Y. Marr. This
of course is not serious or clever.
N. Y. Marr considered that grammar is an empty "formality,"
and that people who regard the grammatical system as the foundation of
language are formalists. This is altogether foolish.
I think that ''formalism'' was invented by the authors of
the "new doctrine" to facilitate their struggle against their opponents
in linguistics.
The cause of the stagnation in Soviet linguistics is not
the "formalism" invented by N. Y. Marr and his "disciples," but the Arakcheyev
regime and the theoretical gaps in linguistics. The Arakcheyev regime was
set up by the "disciples" of N. Y. Marr. Theoretical confusion was brought
into linguistics by N. Y. Marr and his closest colleagues. To put an end
to stagnation, both the one and the other must be eliminated. The removal
of these plague spots will put Soviet linguistics on a sound basis, will
lead it out on to the broad highway and enable Soviet linguistics to occupy
first place in world linguistics.
Pravda, July 4, 1950

Concerining Certain Problems of Linguistics
June 29, 1950
Reply to Comrade Sanzheyev
Esteemed Comrade Sanzheyev,
I am replying to your letter with considerable delay, for
it was only yesterday forwarded to me from the apparatus of the Central
Committee.

Your interpretation of my standpoint on the question of dialects
is absolutely correct.


"Class" dialects, which it would be more correct to call
jargons, do not serve the mass of the people, but a narrow social upper
crust. Moreover, they do not have a grammatical system or basic word stock
of their own. In view of this, they cannot possibly develop into independent
languages.


Local ("territorial") dialects, on the other hand, serve
the mass of the people and have a grammatical system and basic word stock
of their own. In view of this, some local dialects, in the process of formation
of nations, may become the basis of national languages and develop into
independent national languages. This was the case, for instance, with the
Kursk-Orel dialect (the Kursk-Orel "speech") of the Russian language, which
formed the basis of the Russian national language. The same must be said
of the Poltava-Kiev dialect of the Ukrainian language, which formed the
basis of the Ukrainian national language. As for the other dialects of
such languages, they lose their originality, merge with those languages
and disappear in them.


Reverse processes also occur, when the single language of
a nationality, which has not yet become a nation owing to the absence of
the necessary economic conditions of development, collapses as a result
of the disintegration of the state of that nationality, and the local dialects,
which have not yet had time to be fully uniformized in the single language,
revive and give rise to the formation of separate independent languages.
Possibly, this was the case, for example, with the single Mongolian language.
Pravda, August 2, 1950

Coneerning Certain Problems of Linguistics
To Comrades D. Belkin and S. Furer
July 11, 1950
I have received your letters.
Your mistake is that you have confused two different things
and substituted another subject for that examined in my reply to Comrade
Krasheninnikova.
In that reply I criticized N. Y. Marr who, dealing with language (spoken)
and thought, divorces language from thought and thus lapses into idealism.
Therefore, I referred in my reply to normal human beings possessing the
faculty of speech. I maintained, moreover, that with such human beings
thoughts can arise only on the basis of linguistic material, that bare
thoughts unconnected with linguistic material do not exist among people,
who possess the faculty of speech.

Instead of accepting or rejecting this thesis, you introduce
anomalous human beings, people without language, deaf-mutes, who have no
language at their disposal and whose thoughts, of course, cannot arise
on the basis of linguistic material. As you see, this is an entirely different
subject which I did not touch upon and could not have touched upon, since
linguistics concerns itself with normal human beings possessing the faculty
of speech and not with anomalous deaf-mutes who do not possess the faculty
of speech.


You have substituted for the subject under discussion another
subject that was not discussed.


From Comrade Belkin's letter it is evident that he places on a par the
"language of words" (spoken language) and "gesture language" ("hand" language,
according to N. Y. Marr). He seems to think that gesture language and the
language of words are of equal significance, that at one time human society
had no language of words, that "hand" language at that time played the
part of the language of words which appeared later.


But if Comrade Belkin really thinks so, he is committing
a serious error. Spoken language or the language of words has always been
the sole language of human society capable of serving as an adequate means
of intercourse between people. History does not know of a single human
society, be it the most backward, that did not have its own spoken language.
Ethnography does not know of a single backward tribe, be it as primitive
or even more primitive than, say, the Australians or the Tierra del Fuegans
of the last century, which did not have its own spoken language. In the
history of mankind, spoken language has been one of the forces which helped
human beings to emerge from the animal world, unite into communities, develop
their faculty of thinking, organize social production, wage a successful
struggle against the forces of nature and attain the stage of progress
we have to-day.


In this respect, the significance of the so-called gesture
language, in view of its extreme poverty and limitations, is negligible.
Properly speaking, this is not a language, and not even a linguistic substitute
that could in one way or another replace spoken language, but an auxiliary
means of extremely limited possibilities to which man sometimes resorts
to emphasize this or that point in his speech. Gesture language and spoken
language are just as incomparable as are the primitive wooden hoe and the
modern caterpillar tractor with its five-furrow plow or tractor row drill.


Apparently, you are primarily interested in the deaf-mutes, and only secondarily
in problems of linguistics. Evidently, it was precisely this circumstance
that prompted you to put a number of questions to me. Well, if you insist,
I am not averse to granting your request. How do matters stand with regard
to deaf-mutes? Do they possess the faculty of thinking? Do thoughts arise
with them? Yes, they possess the faculty of thinking and thoughts arise
with them. Clearly, since deaf-mutes are deprived of the faculty of speech,
their thoughts cannot arise on the basis of linguistic material. Can this
be taken to mean that the thoughts of deaf-mutes are naked, are not connected
with the "standards of nature" (N. Y. Marr's expression)? No, it cannot.
The thoughts of deaf-mutes arise and can exist only on the basis of the
images, sensations and conceptions they form in every-day life on the objects
of the outside world and their relations among themselves, thanks to the
senses of sight, of touch, taste, and smell. Apart from these images, sensations
and conceptions, thought is empty, is deprived of all content, that is,
it does not exist.

To Comrade A. Kholopov
July 28, 1950
I have received your letter.
Pressure of work has somewhat delayed my reply.
Your letter tacitly proceeds from two premises: from the
premise that it is permissible to quote the work of this or that author
apart from the historical period of which the quotation treats, and secondly,
from the premise that this or that conclusion or formula of Marxism, derived
as a result of studying one of the periods of historical development, holds
good for all periods of development and therefore must remain invariable.
I must say that both these premises are deeply mistaken.

A few examples.


In the forties of the past century when there was no monopoly capitalism
as yet, when capitalism was developing more or less smoothly along an ascending
line, spreading to new territories it had not yet occupied, and the law
of uneven development could not yet fully operate, Marx and Engels concluded
that a socialist revolution could not be victorious in one particular country,
that it could be victorious only as a result of a joint blow in all, or
in most, civilized countries. This conclusion subsequently became a guiding
principle for all Marxists.


However, at the beginning of the twentieth century, especially
in the period of the first world war, when it became clear to everyone
that pre-monopoly capitalism had definitely developed into monopoly capitalism,
when rising capitalism had become dying capitalism, when the war had revealed
the incurable weaknesses of the world imperialist front, and the law of
uneven development predetermined that the proletarian revolution would
mature in different countries at different times, Lenin, proceeding from
Marxist theory, came to the conclusion that in the new conditions of development,
the socialist revolution could fully prove victorious in one country taken
separately, that the simultaneous victory of the socialist revolution in
all countries, or in a majority of civilized countries, was impossible
owing to the uneven maturing of the revolution in those countries, that
the old formula of Marx and Engels no longer corresponded to the new historical
conditions.


It is evident that here we have two different conclusions
on the question of the victory of socialism, which not only contradict,
but exclude each other.


Some textualists and Talmudists who quote mechanically without
delving into the essence of the matter, and apart from historical conditions,
may say that one of these conclusions should be discarded as being absolutely
incorrect, while the other conclusion, as the absolutely correct one, should
be applied to all periods of development. Marxists, however, cannot but
know that the textualists and Talmudists are mistaken, they cannot but
know that both of these conclusions are correct, though not absolutely,
each being correct for its own time: Marx's and Engels' conclusion -- for
the period of pre-monopoly capitalism; and Lenin's conclusion -- for the
period of monopoly capitalism.


Engels in his Anti-Dühring said that after the victory of the socialist
revolution, the state is bound to wither away. On these grounds, after
the victory of the socialist revolution in our country, textualists and
Talmudists in our Party began demanding that the Party should take stops
to ensure the speedy withering away of our state, to disband state organs,
to give up a standing army.


However, the study of the world situation of our time led
Soviet Marxists to the conclusion that in the conditions of capitalist
encirclement, when the socialist revolution has been victorious only in
one country, and capitalism reigns in all other countries, the land of
the victorious revolution should not weaken, but in every way strengthen
its state, state organs, intelligence organs and army, if that land does
not want to be crushed by the capitalist encirclement. Russian Marxists
came to the conclusion that Engels' formula has in view the victory of
socialism in all, or in most, countries, that it cannot be applied in the
case where socialism is victorious in one country taken separately and
capitalism reigns in all the other countries.


Evidently, we have here two different formulas regarding
the destiny of the socialist state, each formula excluding the other.


The textualists and Talmudists may say that this circumstance
creates an intolerable situation, that one of these formulas must he discarded
as being absolutely erroneous, and the other -- as the absolutely correct
one -- must be applied to all periods of development of the socialist state.
Marxists, however, cannot but know that the textualists and Talmudists
arc mistaken, for both these formulas are correct though not absolutely,
each being correct for its time: the formula of Soviet Marxists -- for
the period of the victory of socialism in one or several countries; and
the formula of Engels -- for the period when the consecutive victory of
socialism in separate countries will lead to the victory of socialism in
the majority of countries and when the necessary conditions will thus have
been created for the application of Engels' formula.


The number of such examples could be multiplied.


The same must be said of the two different formulas on the
question of language, taken from various works of Stalin and cited by Comrade
Kholopov in his letter.


Comrade Kholopov refers to Stalin's work Concerning Marxism
in Linguistics, where the conclusion is drawn that, as a result of the
crossing, say, of two languages, one of them usually emerges victorious,
while the other dies away, that, consequently, crossing does not produce
some new, third language, but preserves one of the languages. He refers
further to another conclusion, taken from Stalin's report to the Sixteenth
Congress of the C.P.S.U.(B.), where it is said that in the period of the
victory of socialism on a world scale, when socialism is consolidated and
becomes part of every-day life, national languages will inevitably merge
into one common language which, of course, will be neither Great Russian
nor German, but something new. Comparing these two formulas and seeing
that, far from coinciding, they exclude each other, Comrade Kholopov falls
into despair. "From your article," he writes in his letter, "I understood
that the crossing of languages can never produce come new language, whereas
prior to your article I was firmly convinced, in conformity with your speech
at the Sixteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.(B.), that under communism, languages
would merge into one common language."


Evidently, having discovered a contradiction between these
two formulas and being deeply convinced that the contradiction must be
removed, Comrade Kholopov considers it necessary to get rid of one of these
formulas as incorrect and to clutch at the other as being correct for all
periods and countries; but which formula to clutch at -- he does not know.
The result is something in the nature of a hopeless situation. Comrade
Kholopov does not even suspect that both formulas can be correct -- each
for its own time.


That is always the case with textualists and Talmudists who
do not delve into the essence of the matter, quote mechanically and irrespective
of the historical conditions of which the quotations treat, and invariably
find themselves in a hopeless situation.


Yet if one examines the essence of the matter, there are
no grounds for considering the situation hopeless. The fact is that Stalin's
pamphlet Concerning Marxism in Linguistics, and Stalin's speech at the
Sixteenth Party Congress, refer to two entirely different epochs, owing
to which the formulas, too, prove to be different.


The formula given by Stalin in his pamphlet, in the part
where it speaks of the crossing of languages, refers to the epoch prior
to the victory of socialism on a world scale, when the exploiting classes
are the dominant power in the world; when national and colonial oppression
remains in force; when national isolation and mutual distrust among nations
are consolidated by differences between states; when, as yet there is no
national equality of rights; when the crossing of languages takes place
as a struggle for the domination of one of the languages; when the conditions
necessary for the peaceful and friendly co-operation of nations and languages
are as yet lacking; when it is not the co-operation and mutual enrichment
of languages that are on the order of the day, but the assimilation of
some and the victory of other languages. It is clear that in such conditions
there can be only victorious and defeated languages. It is precisely these
conditions that Stalin's formula has in view when it says that the crossing,
say, of two languages, results not in the formation of a new language,
but in the victory of one of the languages and the defeat of the other.


As regards the other formula by Stalin, taken from his speech
at the Sixteenth Party Congress, in the part that touches on the merging
of languages into one common language, it has in view another epoch, namely,
the epoch after the victory of socialism on a world scale, when world imperialism
no longer exists; when the exploiting classes are overthrown and national
and colonial oppression is eradicated; when national isolation and mutual
distrust among nations is replaced by mutual confidence and rapprochement
between nations; when national equality has been put into practice; when
the policy of suppressing and assimilating languages is abolished; when
the co-operation of nations has been established, and it is possible for
national languages freely to enrich one another through their co-operation.
It is clear that in these conditions there can be no question of the suppression
and defeat of some languages, and the victory of others. Here we shall
have not two languages, one of which is to suffer defeat, while the other
is to emerge from the struggle victorious, but hundreds of national languages,
out of which, as a result of a prolonged economic, political and cultural
co operation of nations, there will first appear most enriched unified
zonal languages, and subsequently the zonal languages will merge into a
single international language, which, of course, will be neither German,
nor Russian, nor English, but a new language that has absorbed the best
elements of the national and zonal languages.


Consequently, the two different formulas correspond to two
different epochs in the development of society, and precisely because they
correspond to them, both formulas are correct -- each for its epoch.


To demand that these formulas should not be at variance with
each other, that they should not exclude each other, is just as absurd
as it would be to demand that the epoch of the domination of capitalism
should not be at variance with the epoch of the domination of socialism,
that socialism and capitalism should not exclude each other.


The textualists and Talmudists regard Marxism and separate
conclusions and formulas of Marxism as a collection of dogmas, which "never"
change, notwithstanding changes in the conditions of the development of
society. They believe that if they learn these conclusions and formulas
by heart and start citing them at random, they will be able to solve any
problem, reckoning that the memorized conclusions and formulas will serve
them for all times and countries, for all occasions in life. But this can
be the conviction only of people who see the letter of Marxism, but not
its essence, who learn by rote the texts of conclusions and formulas of
Marxism, but do not understand their meaning.


Marxism is the science of the laws governing the development
of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and
exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries,
the science of building communist society. As a science, Marxism cannot
stand still, it develops and is perfected. In its development, Marxism
cannot but be enriched by new experience, new knowledge -- consequently
some of its formulas and conclusions cannot but change in the course of
time, cannot but be replaced by new formulas and conclusions, corresponding
to the new historical tusks. Marxism does not recognize invariable conclusions
and formulas, obligatory for all epochs and periods. Marxism is the enemy
of all dogmatism.

only different patois. However, as there is no documentary evidence for
the existence of a "parent language" of most of the dialects or languages,

Q. How do you, evaluate the last declaration of the British Prime Minister Attlee, in the House of Commons, that since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has not disarmed; that is, they have not demobilized their troops; that the Soviet Union has since then even further increased their forces?
A. I evaluate this declaration of Prime Minister Attlee as a slander on the Soviet Union.
The whole world knows that the Soviet Union has demobilized its troops after the war. As it is known, the demobilization was carried out in three phases: the first and second phases in the year 1945, and the third phase from May to September, 1946. In addition, in the years 1946 and 1947, the demobilization of older age groups of the Soviet army was carried through and, starting in 1948, the rest of the older age groups were demobilized.
That is a generally known fact.
If Prime Minister Attlee was conversant with finance and economy he would be able to understand, without difficulty, that no one state, also not the Soviet Union, is in the position to completely develop the volume of their peace industry, - even more, - dozens of billions of the state expenditure is required for the purpose of building, such as the hydro-power works on the Volga,  Dnieper and Amu-Darya; to introduce the policy of a systematic reduction in the price of consumer goods. Likewise, dozens of billions of the state expenditure is needed to immediately add to the hundreds of billions for the reconstruction of the economy demolished by the German occupation, to expand the people's economy and at the same time to increase their military forces and develop their war industry. It is not difficult to understand that such a foolish policy would lead to state bankruptcy. Prime Minister Attlee must, from his own experience as well as, from the experience of the U.S.A., know that the increasing of the military forces of countries and the development of the arms race would lead to a limitation of the peace industry, to a close-down of great civic building, to a raising of tax and to a raising of the price of consumer goods. It is understandable that, if the Soviet Union does not limit the peace industry but, on the contrary, furthers it, then new building, greater hydro-power works and water systems will not be suspended but, on the contrary, developed, the policy of reducing prices will not be suspended but, on the contrary, continued, they could not at the same time develop their war industry and increase their military strength without thereby taking the risk of bankruptcy.
And if Prime Minister Attlee, despite all these facts and economic considerations, nevertheless holds it possible to openly insult the Soviet Union and its peaceful politics, one can only declare that, by slandering the Soviet Union, the present Labour government in England wants to justify carrying on their own arms race.
Prime Minister Attlee needs to lie about the Soviet Union; he must represent the peaceful politics of the Soviet Union as aggressive, and the aggressive politics of the English government as peaceful politics to mislead the English people, to blindfold them with this lie about the Soviet Union, and in this way drag them towards a new world war that would be organized by the warmongering circles in the United States of America.
Prime Minister Attlee pretends to be a follower of peace. But if he really is for peace, why was he against the proposal of the Soviet Union in the United Nations Organization on the conclusion of a peace pact between the Soviet Union, England, the United States of America, China and France?
If he really is for peace, why is he against the proposals of the Soviet Union to immediately begin to limk armaments and to immediately forbid atomic weapons?
If he really is for peace, why does he persecute those that intercede for the defence of peace; why has he forbidden the peace congress in England? Could the campaign for the defence of peace possibly threaten the security of England?
It is clear that Prime Minister Attlee is not for the keeping of peace, but rather for the unleashing of a new world-encompassing war of aggression.
Q. What do you think about the intervention in Korea? How can that end?
A. If England and the United States of America finally decline the proposals of the People's Government of China for peace, then the war in Korea can only end in defeat of the interventionists.
Q. Why? Are then, the American and English generals and officers worse than the Chinese and Korean?
A. No, not worse. The American and English generals and officers are not worse than the generals and officers of any other country you like to name. Where the soldiers of the U.S.A. and England are concerned, in the war against Hitler-Germany and militaristic Japan, they proved to be the best side, as is known. Where, then, lies the difference? In that the soldiers in the war against Korea and China do not consider it as just, whereas in the war against Hitler-Germany and militaristic Japan, they considered it absolutely just. It also lies in that this war is extremely unpopular among the American and English soldiers.
In this case it is difficult to convince the soldiers that China, who threatened neither England nor America, from whom the Americans stole the island of Taiwan, are aggressors, and that the U.S.A., having stolen the island of Taiwan and led their troops straight to the borders of China, is the defending side. It is therefore difficult to convince the troops that the U.S.A. is right  to defend its security on Korean territory and on the borders of China, and that China and Korea are not right to defend their security on their own territory or on the borders of their states. That is why the war is unpopular among the American and English soldiers.
it is understandable that experienced generals and officers will suffer a defeat if their soldiers are forced into a war which they consider totally unjust, and if they believe their duties at the front to be formal, without believing in the justice of their mission, without feeling enthusiasm.
Q. flow do you evaluate the decision of the United Nations Organization to declare the Chinese People's Republic as the aggressors?
A. 1 regard it as a scandalous decision.
Really, one must have lost what was left of conscience to maintain that the United States of America, which has stolen Chinese territory, the island of Taiwan, and fallen upon China's borders in Korea, is the defensive side; and on the other hand, to declare that the Chinese People's “Republic which has defended its borders and striven to take back the island of Taiwan, stolen by the Americans, is the aggressor.
The United Nations Organization, which was created as a bulwark for keeping peace, has been transformed into an instrument of war, a means to unleash a new world war. The aggressive core of the United Nations Organization have formed the aggressive North Atlantic pact from   ten   member  states  (the   U.S.A., England, France, Belgium, Canada, Holland, Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway, Iceland) and twenty Latin-American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Equador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruquay, Venezuela.) And the representatives of these countries now make the decisions in the United Nations Organization about war and peace. It was these that have, in the United Nations Organizations, carried through the scandalous decision about the aggression of the Chinese People's Republic.
It is typical of the present situation in the United Nations Organization, that, for example, the little Dominican Republic in America that has a population figure of scarcely two million, has today the same weight in the United Nations Organization as India has, and a much greater weight than the Chinese People's Republic, which has been robbed of a voice in the United Nations Organization.
Thus, the United Nations Organization, from being a world organization of nations with equal rights, has changed into an instrument of a war of aggression. In reality, the United Nations Organization is now not so much a world organization as an organization for the Americans and treats American aggression as acceptable. Not only the United States of America and Canada are striving to unleash a new war, but on this path you also find the twenty Latin-American  countries;   their   landowners  and   merch.ants long for a new war somewhere in Europe or Asia, to sell their goods to the countries at inflated prices, and to make millions out of this bloody business. The fact is not a secret -to anybody that the representatives of the twenty Laiin-American countries represent the strongest supporters and the willing army of the United Stales of America in the United Nations Organization.
The United Nations Organization treads, in this maniier, the inglorious path of the League of Nations. Thereby they bury their moral authority unci fall into decay.
Q. Do you hold a new world war to be unavoidable?
A. No. At least, one can, at present, hold it to be not unavoidable.
Of course, in the United States of America, in England and also in France, there are aggressive powers that long for a new war. .They need war to achieve super-profits and to plunder other countries. These are the billionaires and millionaires that regard war as a fountain of revenue,  that brings colossal profits.
They, the aggressive powers, hold the reactionary governments in their hands and guide them. But at the same time they are afraid of their people who do not want a new war and are for the keeping of peace. Therefore they take the trouble of using the reactionary governments to ensnare their people with lies, to deceive them, to represent a new war as a war of defence, and   the   peaceful  politics of  peace-loving countries as aggressive. They take the trouble to deceive the people, to force them and draw them into a new war with their aggressive plans.
They therefore even fear the campaign for the defence of peace, they fear that this campaign would expose the aggressive intentions of the reactionary governments.
They therefore even oppose the proposals of the Soviet Union on the conclusion of a peace treaty, on the limitation of armaments and on the forbidding of atomic weapons; they fear that the acceptance of these proposals would frustrate the aggressive measures of the reactionary governments and render the arms race unnecessary.
Where will all this struggle between the aggressive and the peace-loving powers end?
Peace will be kept and strengthened if the people take the holding of peace into their own hands and defend it to the utmost. War could be unavoidable if the arsonists of war succeed in trapping the masses with their lies, in deceiving them and in drawing them into a new war.
Now, therefore, a broad campaign for the holding of peace, as a way of exposing the criminal machinations of the arsonists of war, is of prime importance.
As far as the Soviet  Union is concerned, it will continue to carry through the politics of preventing war and keeping peace.

To the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the Chinese People's Republic, Comrade Mao Tse Tung.
I thank you, Comrade Chairman, for the high estimation of the role which the Soviet Union and its fighting power played in the smashing of Japanese aggression.
The Chinese people, and their liberation army have played a great role, despite the machinations of the Kuomintang, in the liquidation of Japanese imperialism. The struggle of the Chinese people and their liberation army has helped the smashing of the Japanese aggression profoundly.
It cannot be doubted that the unbreakable friendship of the Soviet Union and the Chinese People's Republic serves and will serve to guarantee peace in the far East against all and every aggressor and arsonist of war.
Please accept, Comrade Chairman, the good wishes of the Soviet Union and its fighting forces on the sixth anniversary of the liberation of   East   Asia   from   the   yoke  of   Japanese   imperialism.
Long live the great friendship of the Chinese People's Republic and the Soviet Union!

Prohibition of Atomic Weapons






J. V. Stalin
Prohibition of Atomic Weapons
October 6, 1951


Source: For Peaceful Coexistence: Post War Interviews
Publisher: International Publishers, New York, 1951
Transcription/Markup: Brian Reid


[Interview with correspondent of Pravda, October 6, 1951]



Question: What is your opinion of the hubbub raised recently in the foreign press in connection with the test of an atom bomb in the Soviet Union?


Answer: Indeed, one of the types of atom bombs was recently tested in our country. Tests of atom bombs of different calibers will be conducted in the future as well, in accordance with the plan for the defense of our country from attack by the Anglo-American aggressive bloc.


Question: In connection with the test of the atom bomb, various personages in the United States are raising alarm and shouting about the threat to the security of the United States. Are there any grounds for such alarm?


Answer: There are no grounds whatever for such alarm. Personages in the United States cannot but know that the Soviet Union is not only opposed to the employment of the atomic weapon, but that it also stands for its prohibition and for the termination of its production. It is known that the Soviet Union has several times demanded the prohibition of the atomic weapon, but each time this has been refused by the Atlantic bloc powers. This means that, in the event of an attack by the United States on our country, the ruling circles of the United States will use the atom bomb. It is this circumstance that has compelled the Soviet Union to have the atomic weapon in order to meet the aggressors fully prepared. Of course the aggressors want the Soviet Union to be unarmed in the event of their attack upon it. The Soviet Union, however, does not agree to this, and it thinks that it should be fully prepared to meet the aggressor. Consequently, if the United States has no intention of attacking the Soviet Union, the alarm of the personages in the United States should be considered as pointless and false, because the Soviet Union does not contemplate ever attacking the United States or any other country.


Personages in the United States are vexed because the secret of the atom bomb is possessed not only by the United States but also by other countries, the Soviet Union primarily. They would like the United States to be the monopolist of the production of the atom bomb. They would like the United States to have unlimited power to intimidate and blackmail other countries. But on what grounds do they think so? By what right do the interests of preserving peace require such monopoly? Would it not be more correct to say that matters are directly the opposite, that it is the interests of preserving peace that require first of all the liquidation of such a monopoly and then the unconditional prohibition of the atomic weapon too? I think that the proponents of the atom bomb may agree to the prohibition of the atomic weapon only if they see that they are no longer monopolists.


Question: What is your opinion regarding international control of the atomic weapon?


Answer: The Soviet Union stands for prohibiting the atomic weapon and terminating the production of the atomic weapon. The Soviet Union stands for the establishment of international control over the fully exact and conscientious implementation of the decision to prohibit the atomic weapon, to terminate the production of the atomic weapon and utilize the already produced atom bombs solely for civilian purposes. The Soviet Union stands for precisely this kind of international control. American personages also speak of control, but their control presupposes not the termination of the production of the atomic weapon, but the continuation of such production in quantities conforming to the amounts of raw material at the disposal of different countries. Consequently, the American control presupposes not prohibiting the atomic weapon, but making it legal and lawful. Thereby the right of the warmongers to annihilate tens and hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants with the help of the atomic weapon is made lawful. It is not difficult to understand that this is not control but a mockery of control and a deception of the peaceful aspirations of the peoples. It is clear that such control cannot satisfy the peace-loving peoples who demand the prohibition of the atomic weapon and the termination of its production.

To the Chief Editor of the Kyodo Agency, Mr. Kiishi Iwamoto
Dear Mr. Iwamoto! I have received your request to send the Japanese people a message for New Year.
It is not a tradition of Soviet statesmen to send greetings to the people of another state. But the great sympathy that the people of the Soviet Union have for the Japanese people,   who  have  suffered   misery   through  foreign occupation, leads me to make an exception to the rule and to accede to your request.
I ask you to convey to the Japanese people my wishes for their freedom and happiness, as well as success in their courageous struggle for the independence of their homeland.
The people of the Soviet Union have in the past, learnt to know themselves, the terror of foreign occupation, in which the Japanese imperialists took part. Therefore, they fully understand the sorrow of the Japanese people, have great sympathy for them and believe that the rebirth and independence of their homeland will be achieved, even as it was by the people of the Soviet Union.
I wish the Japanese workers liberation from unemployment, from poor wages, the abolition of high prices for consumer goods and success in the struggle for keeping peace.
I wish the Japanese peasants . liberation from landlessness and poverty, the abolition of high taxes and success in the struggle for keeping peace.
I wish the entire Japanese people and their intelligentsia, complete victory of the democratic forces of Japan, the revival and prosperity of the economic life of the country, a blossoming of national culture, knowledge and art as well as success in the struggle for keeping peace.

Comrades!
Permit me, in the name of our Party Congress, to express our thanks to all fraternal parties and organizations whose representatives have honoured our Party Congress by their presence, or who have sent our Party Congress greetings of friendship, for their wishes for our further success and for their confidence. (Stormy, prolonged applause that became an ovation.)
For us, this trust is especially valuable as it signifies their readiness to support our Party in its struggle for a better future for the people, in its struggle against war, in its struggle to keep peace. (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
It would be a mistake to believe that our Party, which has become a mighty power, does not need more support. That would be wrong. Our Party and our country need the continuous trust, sympathy and support of fraternal peoples outside our borders, and will always need it.
The special quality of this support lies in that every support of the peace endeavours of our Party by each fraternal party, simultaneously signifies the support of their own people in their struggle to keep peace. As the English workers in the years 1918-1919, during the armed attack of the English bourgeoisie on the Soviet Union, organized their struggle against the war under the slogan "Hands off Russia!", was a support, it was above all a support of the struggle of their own people for peace, and then, also, a support of the Soviet Union. If Comrade Thorez or Comrade Togliatti declare that their people do not want to be led into a war against the people of the Soviet Union, (stormy applause), - then that is a support, above all a support for the French and Italian workers and peasants who struggle for peace, and then, also, a support of the peace endeavours of the Soviet Union. The special quality of the present support is thus explained, that the interests of our Party are not only not against the interests of the peace-loving people, but on the contrary, blend with them. (Stormy applause.) Where the Soviet Union is concerned, its interest in the matter of world peace cannot be 
separated from the cause of peace in the whole world.
It is understood that our Party must do its duty by its fraternal parties and support them and their peoples in the struggle for liberation and in their struggle for keeping peace. This is what the Party does. (Stormy applause.) After the seizure of power by our Party in 1917, and after our Party took real measures to eliminate the yoke of capitalists and landlords, the representatives of the' fraternal parties, inspired by our daring and the success of our Party, gave it the name "Shock Brigade" of the revolutionary   movement   and   the   workers'   movement   of the world. Thereby they expressed the hope that the success of the "Shock Brigade" would alleviate the sufferings of the people in the situation of being under the capitalist yoke. I think that our Party has fulfilled these hopes, especially in the time of the second world war, as the Soviet Union smashed the German and Japanese fascist tyranny and liberated the European and Asian peoples from the danger of fascist slavery. (Stormy applause.)
Of course it was very difficult to fulfil this honourable task as long as there was only one "Shock Brigade," as long as it stood alone, the avant-garde in the 
fulfillment of this task. But that is in the past. Now it is completely different. Now, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, new "Shock Brigades" have appeared on the map, in the form of people's democracies; now the struggle has been eased for our Party and also the work proceeds better. (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
Special attention must be paid to the communist, democratic or worker and peasant parties that are not yet in power and which must carry out their work under the yoke of strict, bourgeois rule. Of course their work is more difficult. But their work is not so difficult as it was for us Russian Communists in the time of the Tsar, as the smallest step forward was declared a serious crime. The Russian Communists nevertheless held firm, did not retreat from difficulties and came to victory. The same will be the case with these parties.
Why is it that these parties do not have such difficult work as the Russian Communists had in the times of Tsarism?
Because, first of all, they have the example of the struggle and success, as in the Soviet Union and in the people's democratic countries, before them. Consequently, they can learn from the mistakes and successes of these countries and thus ease their work.
Because, secondly, the bourgeoisie itself, the arch-enemy of the freedom movement, has become different, has essentially changed, has become more reactionary, has lost the cooperation of the people and thus has been weakened. It is understood that these circumstances must likewise ease the work of the revolutionary and democratic parties. (Stormy applause.)
Earlier, the bourgeoisie presented themselves as liberal, they were for bourgeois democratic freedom and in that way gained popularity with the people. Now there is not one remaining trace of liberalism. There is no such thing as "freedom of personality" any more, - personal rights are now only acknowledged by them, the owners of capital, - all the other citizens are regarded as raw materials, that are only for exploitation. The principle of equal rights for people and nations is trodden in the dust and it is replaced by the principle of Full rights for the exploiting minority and the lack of rights of the exploited majority of the citizens. The banner of bourgeois democratic freedom  has been  flung overboard. I think  that  you, the representatives of communist and democratic parties must pick up this banner and carry it forward if you want to gain the majority of the people. There is nobody else to raise it. (Stormy applause.)
Earlier, the bourgeoisie, as the heads of nations, were for the rights and independence of nations and put that "above all." Now there is no trace left of this "national principle." Now the bourgeoisie sell the rights and independence of their nations for dollars. The banner of national independence and national sovereignty has been thrown overboard. Without doubt, you, the representatives of the communist and democratic parties must raise this banner and carry it forward if you want to be patriots of your countries, if you want to be the leading powers of the nations. There is nobody else to raise it. (Stormy applause.)
That is how matters stand at present.
It is understood that all these circumstances must ease the work of the communist and democratic parties that are not yet in power.
Consequently, there is every ground for the success and victory of the fraternal parties in the lands of capitalist rule. (Stormy applause.)
Long live our fraternal parties! (Prolonged applause.)
Long life and health to the leaders of the fraternal parties! (Prolonged applause.)
Long  live  the peace  between  the peoples!
(Prolonged applause.)
Down with the arsonists of war! (Everyone stood up. Stormy, prolonged applause that became an ovation. There were shouts of "Long live Comrade Stalin!" "Long live the great leader of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin!" "The, great Stalin!" "Long live peace between the peoples!")
(Speech at the 19th Party Congress of the C.P.S.U., Dietz Press, Berlin 1952, Pp. 5 - 15)
