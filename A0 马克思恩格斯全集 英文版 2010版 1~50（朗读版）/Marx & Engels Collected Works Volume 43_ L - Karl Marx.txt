Chronologically it completes the period from 1864 to 1870, an important one in the history of Marxism and the international working-class movement, which laid the basis for Marxism's great influence on the mass working-class movement.
The years 1868-1870 witnessed the formation of the first workers' parties in a number of countries and the establishment of socialist principles in the programme documents of the International Working Men's Association (the First International).
The Association's activity during these years took place against the background of the grow­ ing class struggle, the aggravation of economic and social contra­ dictions in Europe, the upsurge in the national liberation strug­ gle of the Irish people, the crisis of the Second Empire and the im­ minent military conflict between Bonapartist France and Bismarck's Prussia.
The international situation was also made more tense as a result of the bourgeois revolution which began in Spain in 1868.
The material in this volume, like that of the preceding one, reflects the remarkably varied activity of Marx and the General Council of the International led by him, activity aimed at strengthening the unity of the working class and educating it in the spirit of proletarian internationalism.
The letters illustrate Marx's active participation in all the theoretical discussions which took place in the Council, in drafting the resolutions of the General Council and in preparing the congresses of the Interna­ tional Working Men's Association.
They also throw light on Marx's 2* XX Preface and Engels's work on the drafting and writing of documents for the International in 1868-1870 (published in vols 20 and 21 of the present edition).
The correspondence makes clear the great extent to which Engels assisted Marx in leading the International.
Marx systematically discussed all important questions with him, kept him informed of the course of discussions in the Council, and of its draft resolutions, and made use of his recommendations.
Engels took an active part in working out the International's tactics, explaining it in letters to eminent members of the working-class movement, in particular the Germans (Wilhelm Liebknecht and Wilhelm Bracke) and frequently defended the position of the International Working Men's Association on various questions in the press.
In the history of the International, the 1868-1870 period was a time of ideological and organisational strengthening.
The Associa­ tion's federations and sections were active in many European countries and the USA.
In Britain it was the trade unions which provided its mass base.
Trade unions as class organisations of the workers also began to take shape in other countries.
'The International Association.
.
.
, as a result of conditions on the continent, .
.
.
is beginning to become a serious power,' Marx wrote in a letter to Engels of 7 July 1868 (see this volume, p.
63).
After the adoption, in November 1864, of the 'Inaugural Address of the Working Men's International Association' and the 'Provisional Rules of the Association', Marx was faced with the task of drawing up a united theoretical programme for the international working-class movement and substantiating and openly proclaiming the principles of scientific socialism in the International's programme.
At the same time he saw clearly that before these principles could be assimilated by the various working-class national organisations a great deal of preparatory work in the press, at congresses and in the local sections would have to be done.
'As the stage of development reached by different sections of the workers in the same country and by the working class in different countries necessarily varies considerably, the actual movement also necessarily expresses itself in very diverse theoretical forms,' Marx wrote to Engels on 5 March 1869.
'The community of action the International Working Men's Association is calling into being, the exchange of ideas by means of the different organs of the sections in all countries and, finally, the direct discussions at the general congresses would also gradually create a common theoretical programme for the general workers' movement' (pp.
235-36).
Marx was guided by the fact that the ideological and organisational unity of action of the working class should be formed on the basis of the real class struggle.
He saw this as the way to Preface XXI overcome reformism and sectarianism in the working-class move­ ment.
The correspondence shows that the Association's success in this direction was due largely to Marx's organisational talent, his ability in the course of everyday struggle to stimulate the class consciousness of the workers and lead them to an understanding of common theoretical and practical tasks.
These tactics of Marx's were a sure pledge of the victory of scientific communism over the sectarian trends in the working-class movement.
As the correspondence in this volume shows, in 1868-1870 the General Council of the Association continued as before to give material assistance and moral support to those taking part in the strike movement, which embraced broad sections of the working class in Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland (pp.
82, 203-04, and 209-10).
During these years international solidarity became a most important factor in the economic strug­ gle of the working class.
The organisation of help to strikers promoted the growth of the authority and popularity of the Inter­ national Working Men's Association among the masses (pp.
8, 350).
As before, Marx participated directly in the preparation of the congresses of the International and had a decisive influence on their work.
He wrote the reports of the General Council to the Brussels (September 1868) and Basle (September 1869) congresses.
Particularly noteworthy is Marx's letter of 10 September 1868 to Johann Georg Eccarius and Friedrich Lessner, in which he outlined the tactics to be adopted by the General Council's delegates to the Brussels Congress.
Here Marx also explains the position of the working class on the question of war in the concrete historical situation at the end of the 1860s in connection with the imminent war between France and Prussia.
Noting the insufficient organisation of the workers, Marx nevertheless consid­ ered it necessary to state clearly in the resolution to be adopted that 'the congress protests in the name of the working class, and denounces those who instigate war' (p.
94).
The campaign for peace was becoming one of the programme aims of the international working-class movement, and its success depended largely on the international unity of the workers.
As the letters show, Marx and Engels expressed their complete satisfaction with the success of the struggle against Proudhonism at the Brussels Congress (p.
102).
The adoption by the Congress of resolutions on the need to turn the land, mines, etc.
, into common property was a convincing victory for socialist principles over the XXII Preface petty-bourgeois views of the Proudhonists.
Thus, the inclusion of the demand for the socialist reorganisation of society in the programme of the International became possible only as a result of progressive workers overcoming the petty-bourgeois world outlook.
It is no accident that the bourgeois press began panic-stricken talk about the communist nature of the Congress's decisions on property (pp.
101, 107).
As can be seen from the correspondence, Marx and Engels linked the demand to abolish private ownership of land very closely with the question of the workers' ally in the countryside, the question of the attitude to small peasant property.
It was precisely from this angle that the question was considered at the Basle Congress.
On 30 October 1869 Marx wrote to Engels about the need for a differentiated approach by the working class to big and small land ownership (p.
364).
In his reply to Marx of 1 November 1869 Engels agreed with his point of view and paid special attention to the heterogeneity of the peasantry, the existence, alongside the big peasant proprietors who exploit day labourers and peasant tenants, of middle and small peasant proprietors.
Engels pointed out that the working class should adopt a flexible policy in relation to the poor sections of the peasantry, taking their interests into account (p.
365).
These ideas of Engels' were elaborated by him in greater detail in his preface to the second edition of The Peasant War in Germany at the beginning of February 1870 (see present edition, Vol.
21).
A number of letters published in this volume reflect the struggle waged by Marx, Engels and the General Council of the Internation­ al against the disorganising activity of Bakunin and his supporters in the International, against Bakunin's anarchist views on major questions of the theory and tactics of the workers' movement.
Bakuninism, a form of anarchism, expressed the protest of the petty bourgeoisie against capitalist exploitation and ruin.
It reflected the mood of petty proprietors unable to find a real way of freeing themselves from capitalist oppression.
In their works and letters Marx and Engels roundly criticised the theory and practice of Bakuninism, pointing out the harm which sectarianism caused to the working-class movement.
The International Alliance of Socialist Democracy set up in the autumn of 1868 in Geneva by Bakunin claimed ideological leadership of the International and at the same time an autonomous existence within it.
The leaders of the Alliance hoped to use the International to propagate anarchist ideas and establish their influence throughout the working-class movement.
Preface XXIII Bakunin's plans encountered strong opposition from the Gener­ al Council.
After receiving the documents of the Alliance and its request for membership of the International Working Men's Association, Marx deemed it necessary to refuse this request.
In a letter to Marx of 18 December 1868 Engels also expressed his strong opposition to allowing the Alliance to join the Association.
'This would be a state within the state,' he wrote to Marx (p.
192).
Engels' proposals contained in this letter were included by Marx in the reply compiled by him on behalf of the General Council and entitled The International Working Men's Association and the Alliance of Socialist Democracy in which he defended the principles of setting up workers' organisations which ensured their unity and solidarity.
In this 'elaborate document the General Council declared the 'Alliance' to be an instrument of disorganisation, and rejected every connexion with it' (p.
491).
In reply to the Alliance's repeated request, Marx drew up a circular letter, The General Council of the International Working Men's Association to the Central Bureau of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy.
This document was actually based on Marx's letter to Engels of 5 March 1869.
It contains criticism of the basic precept of the Bakuninist programme—the demand for 'the political, economic and social equalisation of the classes'.
Marx showed convincingly that the demand for the 'equalisation of the classes' was equivalent to the bourgeois socialists' slogan about 'harmony of capital and labour' and fundamentally opposed to 'the general tendency of the International Working Men's Association—the complete emancipation of the working classes' (p.
236).
The history of the General Council's struggle against subse­ quent attempts by Bakunin and his supporters to disorganise the International Working Men's Association and also lengthy criticism of the main points of Bakunin's programme are to be found in Marx's letter to Lafargue of 19 April 1870.
Describing Bakuninism as a sectarian tendency alien to the working-class movement, Marx focuses his criticism mainly on two of Bakunin's demands: the demand to abolish the right of inheritance, which was declared to be the point of departure of social revolution and the only way to abolish private property, and the renunciation of the political activity of the working class.
The theoretical weakness of Bakunin's recipe, Marx pointed out, lay in the fact that he did not understand the objective link between the basis and the superstructure of capitalist society.
'The whole thing rests on a superannuated idealism, which considers the actual jurisprudence as the basis of our economical state, instead of seeing that our economical state is the basis and source of our jurisprudence!' (p.
490).
Marx also stressed the poli­ tical and tactical harm of Bakunin's thesis.
Proclaiming the aboli­ tion of the right of inheritance, Marx believed, would inevitably alienate the working class from its ally, the peasantry.
This demand would be 'not a serious act, but a foolish menace, rallying the whole peasantry and the whole small middle-class round the reaction' (ibid.
).
Marx also showed how mistaken was Bakunin's demand that the working class should be restrained from taking any part in the political struggle.
It misled the workers and prevented the adoption of an independent working-class policy, the growth of class consciousness and the formation of political parties of the working class (pp.
490-91).
As their correspondence shows, Marx and Engels focused their attention on the destiny of the international working-class move­ ment.
With the creation of the North German Confederation in 1867 the German working class was faced with the task of closing its ranks and setting up an independent proletarian party.
Its ties with the International were of great importance for the ideologi­ cal and organisational development of the German working-class movement in the latter half of the 1860s.
Marx, who perform­ ed the duties of the Corresponding Secretary for Germany from the moment of the founding of the International Working Men's Association, was very closely linked with the German workers.
Certain aspects of the activity of one of the German sections, that of Solingen, are revealed by Engels' letter of 8 February 1870 to Karl Klein and Friedrich Moll.
A serious obstacle to educating the German workers in the spirit of scientific communism and proletarian internationalism was Lassalleanism.
The correspondence published in this volume enables us to trace the way in which Marx, Engels and their supporters Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel, who led the revolutionary wing of the German working-class movement, opposed the Lassallean programme and tactics.
In his letter of 13 October 1868 to the President of the General Association of German Workers, J.
B.
Schweitzer, Marx gave an objective ap­ praisal of Lassalle's role in the German working-class movement.
It was to Lassalle's credit, Marx wrote, that he had revived 'after fifteen years of slumber' an independent working-class movement in Germany free from the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie Preface XXV (p.
132).
But Lassalle's essentially reformist programme was an eclectic one.
His overestimation of setting up workers' co-operatives with state assistance as a means to the social transformation of society (he viewed universal suffrage as the chief way of attaining this aim), his political orientation towards an alliance with Bismarck's government in the matter of German unification, and the sectarian nature of the organisation created by him, were at variance with the aims of the German working-class movement and laid the foundations for the opportunist trend within it (pp.
132-34).
Marx noted that the leaders of the General Association of German Workers, afraid of losing their influence with the masses, had been forced to make important additions to Lassalle's agitational demands.
In particular, the programme adopted at the Hamburg Congress (August 1868) included the following points: 'agitation for complete political freedom, regulation of the working day and international co-operation of the working class', i.
e.
'the starting points of any "serious" workers' movement' (see Marx's letter to Engels of 26 August 1868).
The questions concerning the economic struggle, which Lassalle ignored (the staging of strikes, organisation of trade unions), were considered at the general German workers' congress in Berlin, called by the leaders of the General Association of German Workers in September 1868.
However, only representatives of the Lassallean trade unions were admitted to the Berlin Congress, which testified to a continuation of the former sectarian course.
In the above-mentioned letter to Schweitzer of 13 October 1868, and many other letters, Marx criticised him strongly for these tactics which led to a split in the trade-union movement and for anti-democratic methods of leadership, as well as criticising the anti-democratic way he set up trade associations.
Marx told Schweitzer that the organisation created by him,'suitable as it is for secret societies and sect movements, contradicts the nature of the trade unions' (p.
134).
From the letters it is clear how carefully Marx and Engels followed the activity of Bebel and Liebknecht at this time, giving them constant advice and supporting their struggle against the Lassalleans to unite the proletarian masses.
While he fully understood the need for co-operation with the petty-bourgeois German People's Party against Prussian reaction, Liebknecht on a number of occasions conceded too much to this party; it was precisely this that provoked the strong criticism of Liebknecht's actions by Marx and Engels (pp.
15-16, 38, 141).
Thanks to tireless agitation by Liebknecht and Bebel there was a shift to the left in the Union of German Workers' Associations, which XXVI Preface gradually freed itself from bourgeois influence and drew increasing­ ly close to the International.
In a letter to Engels of 29 July 1868 Marx noted with satisfaction that at the forthcoming Congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations in Nuremberg in September 1868 it was certain to join the International Working Men's Association and adopt its programme (p.
75).
Marx and Engels believed that this success should be consolidated and the prerequisites created for the formation of a proletarian party in Germany by a further break with Lassalleanism and the complete overcoming by the German workers of their ideological dependence on non-proletarian elements alien to them.
'The dissolution of the Lassallean sect and, on the other hand, the severence of the Saxon and South German workers from the leading-strings of the 'People's Party' are the two fundamental conditions for the new formation of a genuine German workers' party,' Marx wrote to Ludwig Kugelmann on 10 July 1869 (p.
313).
In their correspondence Marx and Engels recorded the rapid 'process of the disintegration of specific Lassalleanism', which speeded up the withdrawal of progressive workers from the Ge­ neral Association of German Workers (pp.
255, 304).
A number of former Lassalle's supporters (Wilhelm Bracke, Theodor York and others) agreed to the proposal made by Bebel and Liebknecht to call a general congress of German Social-Democrats.
At this Congress, which took place in Eisenach from 7 to 9 August 1869, the Social-Democratic Workers' Party was founded.
The creation of an independent workers' party in Germany was a great victory for Marxism and for the ideas of the International in the German working-class movement (see Engels' letter to Wilhelm Bracke of 28 April 1870, pp.
498-99).
As Lenin pointed out later, in Eisenach a firm foundation was laid for 'a genuinely Social-Democratic workers' party.
And in those days the essential thing was the basis of the party'.
(V.
I.
Lenin, Collected Works, Vol.
19, p.
298.
) A number of letters published in this volume reflect the desire of Marx and Engels to raise the level of the theoretical awareness of members of the German working-class movement by means of propagating in the press the ideas of scientific communism and their criticism of Lassalleanism.
This volume also contains material concerning the preparation for publication of a short biography of Marx written by Engels (p.
76) and a new edition of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and The Peasant War in Germany, which Marx and Engels supplied with new prefaces.
Marx had a very high opinion of Engels' Preface to The Peasant War in Germany, which was published in Der Volksstaat : Preface XXVII 'Your introduction is very good.
I know of nothing that should be altered or added.
.
.
' (p.
428).
The letters in this volume show how closely Marx and Engels followed the development of the working-class movement in France on the eve of the Franco-Prussian war and the Paris Commune.
The deepening crisis of the Second Empire and the growth of revolutionary activity among the masses helped to extend the influence of the International in France.
Within the French working class the characteristic Proudhonist renunciation of active forms of organising workers (economic and political) was gradually being overcome.
There was a growing trend towards the emergence of a workers' party.
Alarmed by the growing influence of the International in the country, the French government tried to check the revolutionary movement with mass reprisals, and also to provoke premature action by the masses in order to strike a blow at the working class.
Marx wrote to Engels on 18 November 1868: 'In France things look very serious.
.
.
The government wants to force the lads on to the streets so that chassepot and rifled cannon may then laisser "faire merveille"' (p.
162).
In March and May of 1868 and June-July of 1870 the Bonapartist government organised three trials against the French sections of the International Working Men's Association.
Leaders of sections of the Association were arrested and accused of plotting against the Emperor.
Noting the provocative character of the victimisation of French members of the International, Marx wrote to his daughter Jenny on 31 May 1870 in connection with the third trial, that the Bonapartist officials were busying themselves in Paris 'to hatch a new complot, in which the "Intern.
W.
Ass.
" is to play the principal part and where I, as .
.
.
"wirklicher geheimer Oberhauptchef" must of course put in my appearance' (p.
525).
He stressed that all the repressive acts of the Bonapartist government were merely leading to a growth in the International's influence in France.
'Our French members are demonstrating ad oculos the French Government the difference between a political secret society and a genuine workers' association.
No sooner had the government jailed all the members of the Paris, Lyons, Rouen, Marseilles etc.
, committees .
.
.
than committees twice as numerous announced themselves in the newspapers as their successors with the most daring and defiant declarations (and, as an added touch, with their private addresses as well).
The French Government has finally done what we so long wanted it to do: transform the political question — Empire or Republic—into a question de vie ou de mort for the working class!' (pp.
522-23).
As leader of the International Marx attached great importance to the consolidation of the truly proletarian elements in France, to their ideological and organisational strengthening.
With his direct help and support the official founding of the Paris Federation of the International took place in Paris on 18 April 1870.
In his letters to Paul Lafargue of 18 and 19 April 1870 Marx advised the leaders of the Federation to adopt firm class positions, not to allow sectarian tendencies and not to give way to the influence of the various petty-bourgeois Proudhonist and Bakuninist doctrines.
'II faut éviter les "étiquettes" sectaires dans l'Association Internationale, he wrote.
'Those who interpret best the hidden sense of the class struggle going on before our eyes—the Communists are the last to commit the blunder of affecting or fostering sectarianism' (p.
485).
Marx's and Engels' letters about France included in this volume are full of hopes for a new outburst of the emancipation struggle of the working class, full of revolutionary optimism based on their belief in the inevitability of a crisis of the Bonapartist regime and major social changes, and full of the awareness that 'the whole historic witches' brew is simmering' (p.
233).
The correspondence shows the deep and constant interest which Marx and Engels took in the problems of the British working-class movement.
In this period, as before, Marx made use of the experience of the mass organisations of the British working class— the trade unions.
Under his leadership the General Council of the International maintained constant connections with a number of the largest trade unions in Manchester, Birmingham and Salford, particularly during their struggle for the full legalisation of trade unions and their national unification.
Marx linked the successful solution of these questions first and foremost with active struggle by rank-and-file trade-union members.
'The squabble among the authorities of the trades unions,' which in fact paralysed them for years, has at last been settled.
.
.
,' Marx wrote to Engels on 26 September 1868 in connection with the formation of the British Trades Union Congress, when the trade unions 'have finally agreed on joint action' (p.
114).
Some of the letters also contain criticism of the reformist leaders of the British trade unions who sought to solve social problems by means of reforms and compromises with the ruling classes (pp.
3-4, 253 and 394-95).
However, the very course of the class struggle (strikes and the mass movement for electoral reform, etc.
), and also the influence of the International, sometimes encouraged British trade unionists in practice to go beyond their socially pacifist and reformist ideas.
This gave Marx a basis for collaborating with the trade-union leaders in the International Working Men's Association up to the time of the Paris Commune.
Simultaneously Marx fought uncompromisingly against their reformist views, urging them to rely on the masses.
However, the revolutionary tendencies which continued to exist in the British mass working-class movement were challenged as be­ fore by the strong reformist influence of the trade-union leaders.
Explaining the failure of the first working-class candidates at the parliamentary elections in 1868, Marx and Engels pointed above all to the ideological and political dependence of the working class on liberal bourgeois leaders, to the fact that the working class did not have its own political party and its own programme.
'Everywhere the proletariat are the rag, tag and bobtail of the official parties.
.
.
,' Engels wrote on 18 November 1868 (p.
163).
Marx's letters clearly show that the electoral defeat forced some of the London trade-union leaders who were members of the General Council to admit the soundness of his criticism and, to a certain extent, to agree with his view of the need for workers to act independently, to fight against them being turned into an appendage of the liberal bourgeoisie, '.
.
.
the English too late but unanimously acknowledged that I had forecast literally for them, the .
.
.
highly amusing upshot of the elections,' he wrote to Engels on 18 November 1868 (p.
161).
The letters tell the story of the International Working Men's Association's break with the trade-unionist newspaper The Bee-Hive, which had been the official organ of the General Council since 22 November 1864.
Under the leadership of bourgeois liberals the newspaper adopted a conciliatory position, ignoring and distorting the documents of the International.
On Marx's initiative the General Council discussed the situation with The Bee-Hive in April 1870 and the newspaper ceased to be the International's organ.
'I denounced the paper as being sold to the bourgeois (S.
Morley, etc.
), mentioned particularly its treatment of our Irish resolutions and debates, etc.
,' Marx wrote to Engels on 28 April 1870 (pp.
497-98).
After the Basle Congress of the International the question of the abolition of large-scale land-ownership as an effective means of fighting poverty, a very topical question for Britain, was actively discussed in democratic circles and among the workers.
Marx saw this as an opportunity to create in Britain an independent political workers' organisation of a non-trade-union nature, an organisa­ tion whose programme would be originally based on the resolu­ tions of the International's congresses.
Thus, the Land and Labour League was founded on 27 October 1869.
Marx became an active member.
Concerning the actual fact of the founding of the League Marx wrote to Engels on 30 October 1869: 'The creation of the Land and Labour League (incidentally, directly inspired by the General Council) should be regarded as an outcome of the Basle Congress; here, the workers' party makes a clean break with the bourgeoisie, nationalisation of land [being] the starting point' (p.
364).
In the second half of the 1860s the growing national liberation movement in Ireland began to have a great influence on British social and political life.
Some of the letters in this volume give a detailed account of the course of the discussion on the Irish question which took place in autumn 1869 in the General Council on Marx's initiative (pp.
371-72, 375-76, 386-87, 392-93) and was connected with the wide­ spread campaign launched at that time in Britain for an amnesty for imprisoned Fenians.
Marx was hoping in the course of this discussion to state in a resolution of the General Council the Brit­ ish working class's internationalist attitude to its ally, the fighters for the national liberation of Ireland.
Illness prevented him from realising this intention, however.
Nevertheless, his point of view was reflected in other General Council documents, in particular, the 'Confidential Communication' (see present edition, Vol.
21) and in letters to active members of the working-class move­ ment in Germany, France and the USA (see this volume, pp.
390-91, 449, 472-76).
In these letters Marx elaborated the thesis that the abolition of the Irish people's colonial enslavement and the granting to the Irish themselves of the right to decide their own fate was the most important condition for the emancipa­ tion of the working class in Britain.
Thus he used the example of Anglo-Irish relations to illustrate a most important thesis in the national colonial question, namely, the community of interests between the participants in the national liberation struggle in the colonies and the workers' movement in the metropolis, and their interaction as a major prerequisite for the emancipation of the working people both in the metropolis and in the colonies.
Ireland, a British colony, Marx explained in his correspondence, was the citadel of British landlordism.
The landed aristocracy mercilessly exploited the Irish peasants.
The colonial enslavement of Ireland was also an important source of the strength of the British bourgeoisie.
Irish workers in Britain were forced to agree to any wage, thereby lowering the standard of living of British workers.
This brought about a split in the working class of Great Preface XXXI Britain and strengthened the position of the capitalists (pp.
473-75).
To destroy the foundations of the rule of the British landed magnates and the financial and industrial bourgeoisie in Ireland would be to weaken the power of these classes in England itself.
Consequently the liberation of Ireland would help the English working class considerably to attain its class aims (pp.
473-75).
In this connection Marx wrote: 'For a long time I believed it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by English working class ascendancy.
.
.
Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite.
The English working class will never accomplish anything before it has got rid of Ireland.
The lever must be applied in Ireland.
This is why the Irish question is so important for the social movement in general' (p.
398).
Marx emphasised that the English working class 'will never be able to do anything decisive here in England before they separate their attitude towards Ireland quite definitely from that of the ruling classes, and not only make common cause with the Irish, but even take the initiative in dissolving the Union established in 1801, and substituting a free federal relationship for it' (p.
390).
'Only by putting forward this demand was Marx really educating the English workers in the spirit of internationalism,' stressed Lenin (V.
I.
Lenin, Collected Works, Vol.
22, pp.
149-50).
The internationalist ideas of Marx and Engels on the Irish question were the result of their deep study of the historical past and present condition of this country and the long history of Anglo-Irish relations.
Engels wrote: 'Irish history shows what a misfortune it is for one nation to subjugate another' (p.
363).
The correspondence throws light on Engels' work on his book on Irish history.
The Franco-Prussian war which began in the summer of 1870 and the revolution which followed in Paris did not, however, allow him to complete this work.
A number of letters in this volume show Marx's constant and profound interest in the development of the American working-class movement.
As the General Council's Corresponding Secret­ ary for the German language sections in the USA, Marx corresponded with representatives of the German workers in America.
He urged them to struggle to overcome sectarianism and strive for the international unity of the American working-class movement and to draw it into the sphere of activity of the International.
'A coalition of the German workers with the Irish workers (naturally, also, with the English and American workers who wish to join in) is the greatest thing you could undertake now.
This must be done in the name of the "International" ', he wrote to Sigfrid XXXII Preface Meyer and August Vogt on 9 April 1870 (p.
476).
Marx wrote with profound regret of the sudden death of William Sylvis, the President of the National Labor Union of the USA, of whose achievements he thought highly, particularly of his struggle to overcome national and local separatism in the American working-class movement (p.
351).
Some of the letters in this volume also indicate the constant interest with which Marx and Engels followed the growth of the revolutionary movement in Russia.
Marx's letter to N.
F.
Daniel-son of 7 October, 1868 marked the beginning of regular correspondence between the founders of Marxism and the leaders of the Russian revolutionary democratic movement.
During this period Marx was strongly aware of the need for more detailed knowledge of life inside Russia after the abolition of serfdom in 1861.
A study of the socio-economic relations of this huge peasant country which had embarked on the path of capitalist develop­ ment led Marx to feel 'deeply convinced that a .
.
.
social revolution .
.
.
is irrepressible in Russia and near at hand' (see Marx's let­ ter to Laura and Paul Lafargue of 5 March 1870).
Marx was con­ vinced that the victory of a popular revolution and the overthrow of tsarism in Russia would provide a powerful impetus for the development of the revolutionary movement throughout the world.
In the concrete historical conditions of the late 1860s Marx regarded the victory of the revolutionary forces in Britain and Russia as one of the main and decisive conditions for the overthrow of capitalist society and the social reorganisation of Europe.
During this period Marx and Engels also established contact with the Russian revolutionary youth educated on the ideals of the great Russian revolutionary democrats N.
G.
Chernyshevsky and N.
A.
Dobrolyubov.
Early in 1870 a Russian section of the International was set up in Geneva.
Concerning this Marx informed Engels on 12 February 1870: 'In Geneva, by the by, a new colony of exiled Russian students has grown up with a programme proclaiming opposition to pan-Slavism, which should be replaced by the "International"' (p.
430).
On 12 March 1870 the members of the Russian section, one of the organisers of which was N.
Utin, sent a letter to London announcing its constitution.
Inviting Marx to represent their section on the General Council, they declared themselves to be in full agreement with the prin­ ciples of the International (pp.
480, 493).
He readily agreed to their request.
'Enclosed, a letter from the Russian colony in Ge­ neva,' he wrote to Engels on 24 March 1870.
'We have admitted Preface XXXIII them; I have accepted their commission to be their representative on the General Council, and have also sent them a short reply.
.
.
' (p.
462).
The propagation and dissemination of Marxism and the overcoming of petty-bourgeois Utopias in the working class were greatly assisted by the publication in September 1867 of Volume I of Marx's Capital After it came out Marx continued to work on its second and third books, which he intended should form Volume II.
In spite of his bad health and constant financial difficulties, Marx nevertheless believed that for him 'there could never, from the outset, have been any question of .
.
.
taking over a business before .
.
.
' the 'book was finished' (p.
185).
In the summer of 1868 Marx embarked upon further inten­ sive study in the British Museum library.
Resuming his work on Volume II of Capital, he decided first and foremost to rewrite and expand the preliminary draft of the second book (Manuscript I).
From the end of 1868 to the middle of 1870 he wrote a new version of the whole of second book of Capital, which he later called Manuscript II.
In the Preface to Volume II Engels subse­ quently evaluated it as 'the only somewhat complete elaboration of Book II.
.
.
' (see present edition, Vol.
36).
It was at this time that Marx made use of The Position of the Working Class in Russia by V.
V.
Bervi (Flerovsky), published in 1869, for his work on Volume II of Capital.
Marx considered Flerovsky's work to be the most important socio-economic study of the condition of the workers after Engels' book The Condition of the Working-Class in England (pp.
423-24).
In this connection Marx began 'to study Russian hammer and tongs' (p.
551) and by the beginning of February 1870 had made considerable progress in the language.
Alongside his work on Book II of Capital, Marx paid considerable attention during this period to the study of problems relating to Book III.
In his letter to Engels of 30 April 1868 Marx outlined his plan for the structure and main contents of the whole of Book III (pp.
21-25).
To be well-equipped with facts Marx continued to study world economic literature.
Thus, in his letter of 7 October 1868 to N.
F.
Danielson he wrote that he could not prepare Volume II of Capital for the press 'until certain official enquêtes, instituted during last year (and 1866) in France, the United States and England, have been completed or published' (p.
123).
Marx made an intensive study of new material on agricultural development and agrarian relations in a number of countries.
He sent various requests for the necessary literature to his comrades XXXIV Preface and his daughter Laura, who had moved to Paris after her marriage (pp.
9 and 97).
Thus, Marx requested De Paepe to let him have the titles of the main works on the structure of land holding in Belgium and Belgian agriculture (p.
412).
He wrote to Sigfrid Meyer, one of the leaders of the German and American working-class movement, on 4 July 1868 asking him to send him American newspapers from time to time.
'In particular, it would be of great value to me,' Marx wrote, 'if you could dig up some anti-bourgeois material about land-ownership and agrarian relations in the United States.
' Marx needed this material, inter alia, for his polemic with the American economist H.
Ch.
Carey on the question of land rent.
Engels' letters of 9 and 19 November to Marx and Marx's letter to Engels of 26 November 1869 contain a critical examination of Carey's mistaken ideas, and also point out errors in Ricardo's theory of.
land rent.
Marx and Engels substantiate their views on the emergence of land rent, quoting convincing examples and facts in support of their theory.
As can be seen from Marx's letters, the agrarian system in Russia was of considerable interest to him in his treatment of the genesis of capitalist land rent in Book III of Capital In the middle of 1868 Marx embarked upon a careful study of Russian sources, in the belief that in 'dealing with the land question, it has become essential to study Russian land-owning relationships from primary sources' (Marx to Kugelmann, 27 June 1870).
Describing Marx's studies of a large number of Russian sources in the 1870s, Engels noted later in the Preface to Volume III of Capital that according to Marx's plan Russia 'was to play the same role in the part dealing with rent in land that England played in Book I in connection with industrial wage-labour' (see present edition, Vol.
37).
As well as continuing to elaborate economic theory Marx and Engels devoted considerable attention in this period to circulating Volume I of Capital and propagating its ideas.
Some of the letters in this volume refer to the steps taken by Marx and Engels to popularise the work.
Engels rendered great service in this respect.
Thus, besides some reviews of the volume for German newspapers, in 1868 Engels also wrote a review for the English bourgeois journal The Fortnightly Review (see present edition, Vol.
20).
In a number of letters Marx and Engels touch upon reviews and comments by bourgeois economists on Volume I of Capital Here, alongside a critical appraisal of the views expressed by the authors of these reviews ('specialist mandarins', as Marx so aptly puts it) (p.
213), they set out in clear and concise form the most important Preface XXXV theses of Marx's economic theory (see, for example, Marx's letter to Ludwig Kugelmann of 11 July 1868).
The main aim behind the efforts by Marx and Engels to disseminate the ideas of Capital was to equip the working class with a scientific revolutionary economic theory in its struggle to free itself from capitalist exploitation.
Linking the elaboration of an economic theory very closely with practical aims, Marx attached great importance to the propagation of his views to a working-class audience.
He delivered a lecture on wages for German workers in London, about which he wrote to Engels on 23 May 1868 (see p.
40).
Engels constantly showed genuine concern for the fate of the working-class movement and the practical application of the conclusions of Marx's political economy.
He intended to write a popular brochure on the contents of Volume I of Capital for the workers (see Engels' letter to Marx of 16 September 1868, this volume, p.
100).
The correspondence of Marx and Engels in this period also illustrates the great importance they attached to the publication of Capital in different languages (French, Russian and English).
In October 1869 Charles Keller, a member of the Paris section of the First International, began work on a translation of Capital (pp.
399, 546), greatly assisted by Marx (p.
359).
The work was not completed, however.
One of the leaders of revolutionary Chartism, George Harney, a companion-in-arms and friend of Marx and Engels, offered his services for the publication of Volume I of Capital in English in New York (p.
276).
Marx was delighted to hear that his book was being translated into Russian (p.
130), and wrote on 7 October 1868 to one of the translators, N.
F.
Danielson.
It was the first translation of Capital, and appeared in 1872.
The letters indicate the truly encyclopaedic knowledge possessed by Marx and Engels, the breadth and variety of their scholarly interests.
During this period they devoted considerable attention to philosophical problems.
In a number of letters Marx criticises Eugen Dühring and F.
A.
Lange for their deprecatory attitude to Hegelian dialectics.
In October-November 1868 Marx and Engels read and dis­ cussed in detail the manuscript of the book entitled Das Wesen der menschlichen Kopfarbeit by the German leather-worker Joseph Dietzgen.
They stressed Dietzgen's considerable learning and his independent discovery of the laws of the materialist theory of knowledge.
On 28 October 1868, in direct response to the impression which the manuscript had made upon him, Marx wrote: XXXVI Preface 'He is one of the most gifted workers I know' (p.
149).
The correspondence also bears witness to the constant interest which Marx and Engels took in the development of the natural sciences, physics, chemistry and biology, and their study of the most important discoveries in these areas (pp.
33 and 246).
As can be seen from Marx's letter to Engels of 18 November 1868, Marx was interested in the problem of the origin of life on earth in connection with research by the Viennese Professor Gustav Jäger and the German scientist Ernst Haeckel, followers of Darwin's theory of evolution (p.
162).
In his letter to Kugelmann of 27 June 1870, Marx sharply criticised the book On the Workers' Question by one of the so-called social Darwinists, F.
A.
Lange, who automatically transferred the law of the struggle for existence discovered by Darwin in the animal and plant world to the history of mankind.
There is also sharp criticism of 'social Darwinism' in Marx's letter to Paul and Laura Lafargue of 15 February 1869.
As before, linguistics remained the special sphere of Engels' scientific interests.
In spring 1869 he resumed his studies of the Friesian and Old Irish languages (pp.
247, 257, 410, 501, 514, 517-18).
The correspondence published in this volume contains extensive biographical material on Marx and Engels and gives a clear picture of their everyday life and struggle, their process of creation and their practical activity during this period, when they were in effect leading the mass international working-class movement.
The letters fully reflect the growing friendship between the two men over the years, their constant collaboration both in the elaboration of theory and in leading the workers' revolutionary struggle, and their touching affection for each other.
For Marx Engels was the person with whom he shared his most intimate thoughts and new scientific ideas.
Engels' attachment to Marx extended to the members of his family, especially his daughters for whom he showed a truly paternal concern.
As the correspondence shows, Marx and Engels devoted considerable attention to the training and ideological education of progressive fighters from the working class.
In the General Council and the administrative bodies of the International in the various countries Marx sought to create a firm backbone of proletarian revolutionaries.
Under the direct influence of Marx, with the assistance of veterans of the working-class movement who had been members of the Communist League and taken part in the Revolution of 1848-49, such as Johann Becker, Johann Georg Preface XXXVII Eccarius, Friedrich Lessner, Karl Pfänder, Wilhelm Liebknecht and Victor Schily, young members of the working-class movement, such as César de Paepe, Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt, were introduced to scientific socialism.
The letters published show how patiently and determinedly Marx and Engels sought to educate their comrades-in-arms, helping them with advice, re­ sponding to their requests and criticising their errors and shortcomings.
An example of the considerate and comradely attitude of Marx and Engels to their friends and comrades-in-arms is the help which they gave to Eugene Dupont, a General Council member, when he was in great need after his wife died and he lost his job (p.
481).
Marx also gave financial assistance to the German worker Eccarius (pp.
284-85).
The correspondence presents us with vivid portraits of Marx's and Engels' comrades-in-arms and friends, active members of the working-class movement, such as Friedrich Lessner, Wilhelm Liebknecht and Ernest Jones.
It also shows us the new generation of revolutionaries—Paul Lafargue; the French ethnographer Gustave Flourens, a man of unusual bravery and courage; the Russian naturalist and revolu­ tionary Hermann Lopatin, whom Marx considered as 'a very wide-awake critical brain' (p.
530), and the young August Bebel.
Marx and Engels spoke with affection and respect of the German chemist and Social-Democrat Carl Schorlemmer; of the English lawyer, member of the International and future translator of Volume I of Capital, Samuel Moore; the English geologist Dakyns, who joined the socialist movement under the influence of Marx and Engels; the German doctor Ludwig Kugelmann and others.
In addition to the correspondence there is Engels' 'Confession' (answers to questions on a semi-humorous questionnaire) which reveals his personal merits, his warm sense of humour and his well-balanced personality.

KARL MARX and FREDERICK ENGELS LETTERS April 1868-July 1870 3 1868 1 MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 1 IN HANOVER London, 6 April 1868 Dear Kugelmann, The young pair3 were registered at a civil ceremony last Thursdayb (since a church wedding is not legally necessary here), and have left for France to celebrate their HONEYMOON.
They send their best greetings to you and Mrs Gertrud.
Coppel paid a call on me here.
Unfortunately, I could not receive him, since I was wrapped in cataplasms.
Engels was here during the wedding, and left again yesterday.
2 In response to his urgings, I have decided to take the arsenic cure, since an end must at last be put to this state of affairs.
One of his friends in Manchester0 was completely cured by this method in a relatively short time.
I had certain prejudices against arsenic after reading in the Gazette médicale about a discussion among French doctors.
d The Irish question predominates here just now.
It has naturally only been exploited by Gladstone and consorts to take over the helm again, and particularly to have an ELECTORAL CRYC at the next elections, which will be based on HOUSEHOLD SUFFRAGE.
3 At the moment, this turn of affairs is detrimental to the workers' party, because the intriguers among the workers, such as Odger, Potter, etc.
, who want to get into the next Parliament, have now found a new excuse for attaching themselves to the bourgeois liberals.
4 This is, however, only a penalty that England—and thus, also, the English working class—is paying for the great centuries-old a Paul and Laura Lafargue -b 2 April -c Presumably Schorlemmer (see this volume, p.

6 April 1868 crime against Ireland.
IN THE LONG RUN it will benefit the English working class itself.
You see, the ENGLISH ESTABLISHED CHURCH IN IRELAND—OR WHAT THEY USE TO CALL HERE THE IRISH CHURCH—is the religious bulwark of English LANDLORDISM IN IRELAND and, at the same time, the outpost of the Established Church in England itself (I am speaking here of the Established Church as a landowner).
The overthrow of the Established Church in Ireland would mean its fall in England, and the two will be followed (in their downfall) by LANDLORDISM, first in Ireland and then in England.
And I have always been convinced that the social revolution must begin seriously from the ground, i.
e.
from landed property.
In addition, the whole thing will have the very useful result that, once the IRISH CHURCH is dead, the PROTESTANT IRISH TENANTS in the province of Ulster will make common cause with the Catholic TENANTS and their movement in the 3 other provinces of Ireland, whereas so far LANDLORDISM has been able to exploit this religious antagonism.
The day before yesterday I received a letter from Freiligrath (wedding cards were, of course, sent to him), containing the following curious sentence.
5—It will perhaps amuse you more, however, if / enclose the letter itself, which I now do.
But you must return it to me.
So that you understand the letter properly, the following: In Berlin, shortly before my book2 came out, there appeared Zwölf Streiter der Revolution von G.
Struve und Gustav Rasch.
In this publication, Freiligrath is acclaimed as 'one' of the 12 apostles and, at the same time, it is proved in great detail that he never was a communist, in fact that it was only through TOO GREAT A CONDESCENSION that he became associated with such monsters as Marx, Engels, Wolff, etc.
b Since Wolff was slandered here too, I wrote to Freiligrath for an explanation, particularly since I knew that G.
Rasch (a scoundrel) headed his begging committee in Berlin.
6 He replied very dryly, and with evasive philistine cunning.
Later I sent him my book without, however, as was formerly our mutual custom, signing it.
He appears to have taken the HINT.
My best regards to your dear wife and Fränzchen.
If at all feasible, I shall come UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES and pay you a visit.

Yesterday I sent you Nos.

c It is dreadfully stupid.
One who was in England for such a long time and who has your book and mined should really know how to put the material supplied to him by the workers to other use than simply reproducing it at full length.
Some anti-federalist passages with us in mind are rather comical in connection with the whole federalist-Struveist nature of the sheet.

And also live well and get plenty of exercise.
Gumpert laughs at your assertion that arsenic makes you stupid.
The vote on parliamentary freedom of speech is explained by the fact that Bismarck had stated previously that for Prussia, for the sake of peace, he would concede this point.
So it was not even, as we thought, proof of the courage of the philistines.
What Wilhelm says about the American treaty is of course nonsense from beginning to end.
10 Unfortunately, I have a death to announce to Tussy.
The poor hedgehog ate a round hole in his blanket, put his head through it, and got so stuck in it that he was found strangled yesterday morning.
Peace to his ashes, and BETTER LUCK TO THE NEXT ONE.

It is a good thing that the opium prescription arrived today.
b The affairs under my arm have become very vexatious since your departure.
2 From the young couple,c who are now in Paris, the most satisfying news.
12 They are obviously very happy.
Lafargue has sent me Horn's pamphletd and another one on French finance.
The second is twaddle, the first I shall send you soon.
I wrote to Lafarguee that the fact that he finds time 'AT SUCH A CRITICAL JUNCTURE' to think of me and send me printed matter goes a long way to prove 'THAT HE MUST BELONG TO A BETTER THAN THE EUROPEAN RACE'.
WE ARE ALWAYS 'CHAFFING' AT EACH OTHER.
I have read the Histoire du Crédit mobilière As far as the real essence of the matter is concerned, I really wrote better stuff on it years ago in the Tribune.
12, The author knows the business.
He is himself a Paris banker.
But he has in fact nothing to draw on except the official material, provided by the Crédit itself in its reports, and the facts noted in the stock market quotations.
The secret material could only be obtained by legal steps.
What astonishes me particularly is this: the actual TRICKS all reduce themselves to stock-jobbing on the exchange, 11 and in this department au fond' there has been nothing new since Law, 14 whatever the disguise.
Neither on this side of the Channel, nor on the other.
The interesting aspect of these things is the practice, not the theory.

Do not forget to send me the Schweitzer^ 5 BY NEXT POST.
From The Times of today (telegraphic dispatch)3 you will see that we have won a complete victory in Geneva, working day reduced from 12 to 11 hours, wages increased by 10%.
16 The matter went like this.
Scarcely had you left when a deputy arrived from Geneva.
17 This FACT, that the workers sent an envoy to London, to the fearsome secret tribunal, was decisive, as earlier in the STRIKE of the bronze workers of Paris.
18 The MASTERS believe in the power and the fighting fund in London.
This should show the workers in England and on the continent the power they would possess in us if they really put at our disposal the appropriate means, etc.
Enclosed returned Wilhelm, 7 Siebel.

9 4 MARX TO LAURA AND PAUL LAFARGUE19 IN PARIS London, 11 April 1868 My dear Cacadou, You know I am a slow hand at writing, but this time the shortcomings of my left arm are responsible for the sins of my right hand.
Under those circumstances I missed the more my secretary who might have addressed to himself, on my behalf, the most charming letters.
20 I am happy to see from your scribblings (you excuse the 'term', Borkheim with his 'scribaille' is still dinning my ears 21) and those of your helpmate12 that you are thoroughly enjoying your Braut-fahrt? and that all the outer circumstances, spring and sun and air and Paris jollities, conjure in your favour.
As to that said helpmate, his sending books to me, at such a critical juncture, speaks volumes for the innate kindness of the 'young man'.
This simple fact would go far to prove that he must belong to a better than the European race.
b By the by, as we have just touched the chapter of books, you might pay a visit to Guillaumin (14, rue Richelieu)22 and get his (economical) bulletins de librairie for 1866-1868.
You might also wend your steps to the Librairie Internationale (15, Boulevard Montmartre) and ask for their catalogues (1865-68).
Of course, if you get these desiderata, you will not send them, but bring them on your return to this dreary place.
I am expecting, from Meissner, 3 copies of my book.
c On their arrival, I shall send two to Caesar de Paepe, one for himself, the other for Altmayer.
d Meanwhile, if you should find the time to see Schily (that is to say if you write to him 4, rue St.
Quentin to come and see you) be so kind to ask him what has become of the 3 copies, 1 I sent for Jacquelard, e 1 for Taine, 1 for Reclus.
If Jacquelard was not to be found, you might give his copy to Altmayer, since Meissner is very slow in forwarding the copies.
In that case, however, I ought to be informed.
You'll certainly fancy, my dear child, that I am very fond of books, because I trouble you with them at so unseasonable a time.
But you would a honeymoon trip -b An allusion to J.

-c the first volume of Capital -d Altmeyer -e Jaclard 3-983 be quite mistaken.
I am a machine, condemned to devour them and, then, throw them, in a changed form, on the dunghill of history.
A rather dreary task, too, but still better than that of Gladstone's, who is obliged, at a day's notice, to work himself into 'states of mind', yclept 'earnestness'.
We feel here rather somewhat lonely.
First you disappeared together with the meridional 'silent man', and then Engels left us.
2 In lieu of an 'excitement' we had the Lormiers yesterday evening.
I played with Louis two parties of chess and allowed him to win one.
What do you think the strange Caliban boy told me, in the most solemn manner of the world, on taking leave? 'Sans rancune, j'espère!' 3 And now, my dear Cacadou, Adio.
Old Nick Dear Lafargue,23 Do you not find that staying in Paris WITH A YOUNG LOVABLE WIFE is much pleasanter than with politics? When your fatherb arrives in Paris, give him my best regards, and, in particular, you and Laura should not forget to make his stay so PLEASANT as possible.
Given the state of his eyes, he needs diversion, and nothing will divert him more than that the young pair should devote to him completely the short time they have with the old gentleman.
I am writing to you in German so that you may, or may not, as you wish, inform the private secretaryc of the contents of these lines.
And now, with heartiest greetings.
Yours faithfully, K.

It is certain that there is theoretically nothing of interest and nothing new to be said about agiotage.
It all comes down to fraud under false pretences and nothing can change here except the manner.
The secret material about the history of the Crédit mobilier 13 can, by the way, and probably will, reach the light of day by itself on the fall of the Empire, even if there is no intervention by the courts.
I had already seen about the glorious victory in Geneva 16 in the newspapers on Saturday15 morning.
The business is all the better since the stupid philistines had made out the International Association to be the real motive force of the affair, and it now receives all the glory.
You will have seen that the intermediaries in the business were Police Prefect Camperio and the noble and serrrious Amand Goegg.
This will have instilled new respect for our power in Mr Amand.
Incidentally, I should like to know how long—following this business—they will leave the International Association unmolested in Germany.
By THE BY, the workers' affairs are proceeding famously.
First Belgium, then Geneva, now Bologna24—I am only surprised that the International has not yet been blamed for this—it keeps going everywhere.

Even if Virchow had knowledge and theoretical interest in politics or political economy, this upright citizen is after all much too deeply engaged.

Only I have to limit the working time, for after ABOUT 3 hours my head starts to buzz and prickle.
I shall now tell you briefly a 'morsel' which occurred to me when I was just glancing at the part of my manuscript about the rate of profit.
c It provides a simple solution to one of the most difficult questions.
The question is how it can happen that as the value of money, or gold, falls, the rate of profit rises; and that it falls with the rise in the value of money.
Let us assume the value of money falls by '/io-Then, other things remaining equal, the price of commodities rises by V10-If, on the other hand, the value of money rises by '/to, then the price of commodities falls by '/io> other things remaining equal.
Given a fall in the value of money, the price of labour, unless it rises in the same proportion, falls, the rate of surplus value rises, a Ludwig III -b B.

37).
10.
Marx to Engels.
22 April 1868 17 and therefore, ALL OTHER THINGS REMAINING THE SAME, the rate of profit rises too.
This rise of the latter—as long as the DESCENDANT OSCILLATION in the value of money continues—is due solely to the fall in wages, and this fall is due to the fact that the change in wages is slow to match the change in the value of money.
(As was the case at the end of the 16th and in the 17th century.
) Conversely, if, with the value of money rising, wages do not fall in the same proportion, the rate of surplus value falls, and therefore, caeteris paribus,3 the rate of profit.
These two movements, the rise in the rate of profit when money falls in value, and its fall when the value of money rises, are, under these circumstances, both due solely to the FACT that the price of labour has not yet been adjusted to the new value of money.
These phenomena (and how they are explained has long been known) cease after the adjustment of the price of labour to the value of money.
This is where the difficulty begins.
The so-called theorists say: As soon as the price of labour corresponds to the new value of money, e.
g.
has risen with the falling value of money, both profit and wages are expressed in so much more money.
Their relation thus remains the same.
Therefore there can be no change in the rate of profit.
The specialists who concern themselves with the history of prices reply to this with FACTS.
Their explanations are mere phrases.
The whole difficulty arises from confusing the rate of surplus value with the rate of profit.
Let us assume that the rate of surplus value remains the same, e.
g.
100%.
Then, if the value of money falls by 7io, wages of £100 (say for 100 men) rise to 110 and surplus value likewise to 110.
The same total quantity of labour, formerly expressed in 200, is now expressed in £220.
If the price of labour is adjusted to the value of money, the rate of surplus value can neither rise nor fall as the result of any change in the value of money.
Assume, however, that the elements, or some elements, of the constant part of capital were to fall in value owing to the growing productivity of labour, whose products they are.
If the fall in their value is greater than the fall in the value of money, their price will fall, despite the drop in the value of money.
If the fall in their value only corresponded to the fall in the value of money, then their price would remain unchanged.
Let us assume the latter case.
For instance, in a certain branch of industry the capital of 500 is composed of 400c+100v, so with a rate of surplus value of 100% we a other things remaining equal 18 10.
Marx to Engels.
22 April 1868 100 have: 400c+100v I +100m= — =20% rate of profit" (in Volume ' 500 CJ L II I intend to use 400c, etc.
, instead of , etc.
, as it is less 400 complicated.
Qu'en penses tu? b).
If the value of money falls by Vio, then wages rise to 110 and ditto surplus value.
If the money price of the constant capital remains the same because the value of its component parts has fallen by '/io as a result of the increased productivity of labour, then now: 400c + 100v | +110m or = 2l29/50% rate of profit, which would therefore have risen by 510 n 1, m r , , HO™ ABOUT 1 /2%, while the rate of surplus value, , remains as before 100%.
ll0v The rise in the rate of profit would be greater if the value of the constant capital sank faster than the value of money, and less if it sank more slowly.
It will continue as long as any fall in the value of the constant capital is taking place, i.
e.
as long as the same quantity of means of production does not cost £440 where it formerly cost £400.
And it is an historical fact, and can be specially demonstrated from the years 1850-1860, that the productivity of labour, especially in industry proper, receives an impetus from the falling value of money, the mere inflation of money prices, and the general international rush for the increased quantity of money.
The opposite case can be developed in an analogous manner.
The extent to which, in one case, the rise of the rate of profit with the sinking value of money, and, in the other, the sinking of the rate of profit with the rising value of money, affect the general rate of profit will depend partly upon the relative size of the particular branch of production in which the change takes place, and partly upon the length of the change, for the rise and fall of the rate of profit in particular branches of industry takes time to infect the other branches.
If the oscillation lasts a relatively short time, it remains local.

Gumpert has a nice row with Borchardt.
Borchardt had accused him of an infringement NOT ONLY OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL ETIQUETTE, BUT OF ALL ETHICS (because in the house of friends, where Borchardt is the doctor and a child had died of scarlet fever, Gumpert had expressed his surprise and astonish­ ment that Borchardt should have allowed the other children and their friends to view the body—Borchardt has 'grounds' for declaring scarlet fever non-contagious) — and Gumpert has brought the case before the medical society here, whereby he has little to gain, however, since the committee consists of nothing but jackasses, a fact which he should, of course, have considered earlier.

For the rate of profit for him then = > than the 50m 400c+110v former .
I retain m here in order to show qualitatively 400c+100u ^ J in the expression itself where the profit comes from.
But it is proper that you should know the method by which the rate of profit is developed.
I shall therefore give you the process in the most general outline.
In Book II,41 as you know, the process of circulation of capital is presented on the basis of the premisses developed in Book I.
I.
e.
the new determinations of form which arise from the process of circulation, such as fixed and circulating capital, turnover of capital, etc.
Finally, in Book I we content ourselves with the assumption that when, in the valorisation process,3 £100 becomes £110, it finds the elements into which it is converted anew already in existence in the market.
But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are to be found in existence, that is to say, the social intertwining of the different capitals, of parts of capital and of REVENUE (=TO).
In Book III41 we then come to the conversion of surplus value into its different forms and separate component parts.
I.
Profit is for us, for the time being, only another name for or another category of surplus value.
As, owing to the form of wages, the whole of labour appears to be paid for, the unpaid part of it seems necessarily to come not from labour but from capital, and not from the variable part of capital but from the total capital.
As a result, surplus value assumes the form of profit, without there being any quantitative difference between the one and the other.
It is only an illusory manifestation of surplus value.
Further, the part of capital consumed in the production of a commodity (the capital, constant and variable, advanced for its production, minus the utilised but not consumed part of fixed capital) now appears as the cost price of the commodity, since for the capitalist that part of the value of the commodity that it costs him is its cost price, while the unpaid labour contained in the commodity does not enter into its cost price, from his point of view.
The surplus value = profit now appears as the excess of the a In the original: Verwertungsprozeß.
See also this volume, p.
360.
selling price of the commodity over its cost price.
Let us call the value of the commodity W and its cost price K; then W—K + m, therefore W— m = K, therefore W>K.
This new category, cost price, is very necessary for the details of the later analysis.
It is evident from the outset that the capitalist can sell a commodity at a profit below its value (as long as he sells it above its cost price), and this is the fundamental law for comprehending the equalisations effected by competition.
Therefore, while profit is at first only formally different from surplus value, the rate of profit is, by contrast, at once really m different from the rate of surplus value, for in one case we have m and in the other ,from which it follows from the outset, since m c + v — > , that the rate of profit < than the rate of surplus V C+V value, unless c=0.
In view of what has been developed in Book II, it follows, however, that we cannot compute the rate of profit on the commodity product of any period we select, e.
g.
that of a week, m but that denotes here the surplus value produced during the year in relation to the capital advanced during the year (as distinct from the capital turned over).
Therefore, stands here for the c + v annual rate of profit.
Then we shall first examine how variations in the turnover of capital (partly depending on the relation of the circulating to the fixed portions of capital, partly on the number of times the circulating capital turns over in a year, etc.
, etc.
) modify the rate of profit while the rate of surplus value remains the same.
m Now, taking the turnover as given, and as the annual rate of profit, we examine how the latter can change, independently of changes in the rate of surplus value, and even of its total amount.
Since m, the total amount of surplus value, = the rate of surplus value multiplied by the variable capital, then, if we call the rate of r-v surplus value ra and the rate of profit p', p'= .
Here we have the 4 quantities p', r, v, c, with any 3 of which we can work, always seeking the 4th as unknown.
This covers all possible cases of movements in the rate of profit, in so far as they are distinct from a Otherwise Marx designates the rate of surplus value as r only in his economic manuscript of 1861-63.
In Volume I of Capital he designates it as the ratio — , and in Volumes II and III as m'.
12.
Marx to Engels.
30 April 1868 23 the movements in the rate of surplus value and, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, even in its total amount.
This has, of course, hitherto been inexplicable to everybody.
The laws thus found—very important, e.
g.
, for understanding how the price of the raw material influences the rate of profit—hold good no matter how the surplus value is later divided among the producer, etc.
This can only change the form of m appearance.
Moreover, they remain directly applicable if is treated as the relation of the socially produced surplus value to the social capital.
II.
What were treated in I as movements, whether of capital in a particular branch of production or of social capital—movements changing its composition, etc.
—are now conceived as differences of the various masses of capital invested in the different branches of production.
Then it turns out that, assuming the rate of surplus value, i.
e.
the exploitation of labour, as equal, the production of value and therefore the production of surplus value and therefore the rate of profit are different in different branches of production.
But from these varying rates of profit a mean or general rate of profit is formed by competition.
This rate of profit, expressed absolutely, can be nothing but the surplus value produced (annually) by the capitalist class in relation to the total of social capital advanced.
E.
g.
, if the social capital=400c+100u, and the surplus value annually produced by it= 100 m, the composition of the social capital=80c + 20f, and that of the product (in percentages)=80c+ 201; | +20m = 20% rate of profit.
This is the general rate of profit.
What the competition among the various masses of capital— invested in different spheres of production and differently composed—is striving for is capitalist communism, namely that the mass of capital employed in each sphere of production should get a fractional part of the total surplus value proportionate to the part of the total social capital that it forms.
This can only be achieved if in each sphere of production (assuming as above that the total capital=80 c + 20 v and the social 20m rate of profit= ) the annual commodity product is sold F 80c+20u ' 7 v at cost price + 20% profit on the value of the capital advanced (it is immaterial how much of the advanced fixed capital enters into the annual cost price or not).
But this means that the price determination of the commodities must deviate from their values.
Only in those branches of production where the percentual composition of capital is 80c+20v will the price K (cost price) + 20% on the capital advanced coincide with the value of the commodities.
Where the composition is higher (e.
g.
90c+10u), the price is above their value; where the composition is lower (e.
g.
70c + 30u), the price is below their value.
The price thus equalised, which divides up the social surplus value equally among the various masses of capital in proportion to their sizes, is the price of production of commodities, the centre around which the oscillation of the market prices moves.
Those branches of production which constitute a natural monopoly are exempted from this equalisation process, even if their rate of profit is higher than the social rate.
This is important later for the development of rent? In this chapter,42 there must be further developed the various causes of equalisation of the various capital investments, which appear to the vulgar conception as so many sources of profit.
Also to be developed: the changed form of manifestation that the previously developed and still valid laws of value and surplus value assume now, after the transformation of values into prices of production.
III.
The tendency of the rate of profit to fall as society progresses.
This already follows from what was developed in Book I on the change in the composition of capital with the development of the social productive power.
* 2.
This is one of the greatest triumphs over the pons asinib of all previous political economy.
IV.
Until now we have only dealt with productive capital*4 Now there enters modification through merchant capital.
According to our previous assumption the productive capital of society = 500 (millions or billions, n'importe c).
And the formula was 400c + 100v | + 100m.
The general rate of profit, p', = 20%.
Now let the merchant capital =100.
So, the 100 m has now to be calculated on 600 instead of 500.
The general rate of profit is thus reduced from 20% to 162/3%.
The price of production (for the sake of simplicity we will assume here that all of the 400c, i.
e.
the whole fixed capital, enters into the cost price of the annual output of commodities) now=583V3-The merchant sells at 600 and therefore realises, if we ignore the fixed portion of his capital, 162/s% on his 100, as much as the productive capitalists; or, in other words, he appropriates 1/6 of the social surplus value.
The commodities—en masse and on a social a Marx means the theory of absolute rent (see present edition, Vol.
37).

His £100 (apart from the fixed portion) only serve him as circulating money capital.
Whatever the merchant swallows over and above that, he gets either simply by trickery, or by speculation on the oscillation of commodity prices, or, in the case of the actual retailer, as wages for labour— wretched unproductive labour that it is—in the form of profit.
V.
We have now deduced profit to the form in which it appears in practice, according to our assumptions 162/3%.
Next comes the division of this profit into entrepreneur's gain and interest.
Interest-bearing capital.
The credit system.
VI.
Transformation of surplus profit into rent.
VII.
At last we have arrived at the forms of manifestation which serve as the starting point in the vulgar conception: rent, coming from the land; profit (interest), from capital; wages, from labour.
But from our standpoint things now look different.
The apparent movement is explained.
Furthermore, A.
Smith's nonsense, which has become the main pillar of all political economy hitherto, the contention that the price of the commodity consists of those three revenues, i.
e.
only of variable capital (wages) and surplus value (rent, profit (interest)), is overthrown.

jnjo Published in English in lull for the first time 13 MARX TO ENGELS 48 IN MANCHESTER London, 4 May 1868 DEAR FRED, This morning I received enclosed letter and cutting from Schweitzer.
Since he addresses himself to me as workers' representative of one of the most industrial districts, I must naturally reply.
49 My view is that the Germans can stand a reduction of the protective tariff on pig iron and that the manufacturers of other articles are also exaggerating their howls.
This view is based upon a comparison of the English and German exports to neutral markets.
Enclosed, by way of example, a note on exports to Belgium/ At the same time, in my opinion, the point is to exploit this question in the interests of the party, without, however, procuring any new reliefs to the English.
My proposal would therefore be: 1.
No reduction of tariffs before a parliamentary enquête 0 into the state of the German iron-mining production and iron manufac­ ture.
This enquête should not, however, be confined, as the bourgeois gentlemen desire, simply to chambers of commerce and 'experts' but should, at the same time, include the workers' a half-hearted -b reins -c See the table on p.

No reduction of tariffs before an enquête into how the railways misuse their monopoly, and before their freight (and passenger) tariffs are controlled by legal regulations.
I would like your view immediately, and also immediate return of the enclosures.

The rascal is utilising this business simply as an inducement to make us take the bait again.
Of course, it does not matter that you give him information this time, but principiis obstadl Don't let the fellow catch your little finger lest he make an attempt on your whole hand.
On the subject itself, I have no doubt at all that the German iron industry could dispense with the protective tariff, a majore,e therefore, could also stand the reduction of the tariff on pig iron from 7 V2 groschen to 5 groschen per hundredweight (from 15s.
to 10s.
per ton), and the other reductions likewise.
The export of iron is increasing every year, and not only to Belgium.
This would bring ruin to a few ironworks established during the wave of speculation in the 50s, situated a long way from the coal and otherwise based on insufficient, poor pits.
But these are for the most part already kaputt, and the vicinity of a railway would be more use to them than any protective tariff if they should ever become viable again.
(There is one like this in Engelskirchen, 500 paces from my brothers' factory—the coal has to be brought from Siegburg, 2 Va German miles/ by wagon — no wonder it lies idle.
This sort of works cries out for protective tariff, and is cited as proof that it is necessary.
) The Elberfeld-Barmen Chamber of Commerce is the nastiest protective tariff institution there is, and notorious for it.
Even though the main industry of the district is aimed at export.
However, there are always a lot of trades in decline there, hence the lamentations.
For the rest, your plan about the enquête^ is rather good, and I like it very much.
As far as railways go, the freight charges in Germany are lower than elsewhere, and, since goods traffic is the main thing in Germany, this could not be otherwise.
They could be pushed still lower, and the governments have the power to do it, but what is most necessary is greater centralisation and equalisa­ tion in administration and freight charges, and constitutionally this is a matter for the Reichstag.
By and large, the iron-chaps have no cause to yell about high freights.

I asked him about the persecution of Jews in Moldavia; he wailed a bit, but it does not appear to be all that bad: we have to bear it, we Jews do not have the power; he would like to be Russian or Austrian, but it does not occur to him to leave.

19J3 Published in English in full for the first time 15 MARX TO ENGELS 48 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 7 May 1868 DEAR FRED, BEST THANKS for your marginal notes.
I have included them in the letter to Schweitzer as far as necessary.
My letter is so coolly phrased that it will not be 'shown around'.
49 Now I would like to ask you for information on another subject.
However, you can postpone this if it should interrupt the work for the Fortnightly, which is urgent.
11 The point is that I would like to link up with Volume I in the examples given in Volume II.
41 In order to use the data on your factory given on p.
18652— completely sufficient to illustrate the rate of surplus value—for the rate of profit, the following would be necessary: 16.
Marx to Dietzgen.
9 May 1868 31 1.
The missing data on the capital advanced for the factory building and the percentage of the SINKING FUND for this.
Ditto WAREHOUSE.
In both cases, the RENT should be given, if paid.
Also the office costs and costs of staff for the WAREHOUSE.
With regard to the steam engine, no data is given on the percentage at which the weekly wear and tear is calculated, and therefore the capital advanced for the steam engine is not visible either.
2.
Now the real question.
How do you calculate the turnover of the circulating part of capital (i.
e.
raw material, auxiliary materials, wages)? How great then is the circulating capital advanced? I would like to receive this answered in detail, even illustrated, particularly the turnover calculation of the circulating capital advanced.
Tomorrow I shall send you the crazy Urquhart for your amusement.

10 May 1868 17 ENGELS TO MARX 48 IN LONDON Manchester, 10 May 1868 Dear Moor, You received the information about the factory at that time direct from Henry Ermen—it is G.
Ermen's spinning mill, with which I have nothing to do, and about which the young Ermens have been specifically forbidden to tell me anything.
If you write to Henry Ermen, Bridgewater Mill, Pendlebury (private), he will probably tell you what you want to know.
But you will have to tell him that he should give you the data as they were in 1860, since much has been built since then.
I would say, approximately, that a factory building for 10,000 spindles, including cost of land, will come to £4,000 à £5,000 (in the given case a bit less is probably to be assumed, since it was only a one-storey SHED, and land up there, unless containing coal, costs almost nothing).
Rate of wear and tear on the building (£500-600 to be subtracted as ground price) 7 '/2% including interest.
At £3,600 therefore £18 ground rent (à 3%) + (7 V 2% on 3,000 = ) 225=£243 rent for the building.
WAREHOUSE does not exist for this factory, since G.
Ermen only sells through or to us or through an agent to other people, and pays 2% commission on the turnover for this.
Assuming the turnover à £13,000, we get £260 as substitute for WAREHOUSE costs.
As far as calculating the turnover of the circulating capital is concerned, I do not really know what you mean by this.
We calculate only the total turnover, that is the total of annual sales.
If I understand rightly, you want to know how many times a year the circulating part of capital is turned over, or, in other words, how much circulating capital is in business.
This, however, differs in almost all cases.
A prosperous owner of a spinning mill has almost always (that is except when he is expanding, or immediately afterwards) some spare capital that he invests in some other way, but uses, when the chance offers itself, to buy cotton cheaply, etc.
Or he uses credit, if he can and it is worthwhile.
It may be assumed that a mill-owner who invests £10,000 in machines (apart from the building, which he can and mostly will rent) can get along with '/s à ]/4 of the fixed capital in circulating capital; that is for 17.
Engels to Marx.
10 May 1868 33 £10,000 fixed capital put into machines, £2,000 à £2,500 circulating capital will do.
This is the average assumption here.
Here I leave out of account the steam engines.
On this score H.
Ermen has obviously provided you, from memory, a complete­ ly absurd story.
Weekly wear and tear of the steam engine £20, that is £1,040 a year! At a 12 1 li% rate the steam engine will cost £8,320, ce qui est absurde.
" The entire machine cannot have cost more than £1,500 à £2,000, and that G.
Ermen wanted to write off his whole machine in 2 years is just like him, but not businesslike.
You can ask him about this, too.
But I fear that Monsieur Gottfried b has long taken these old account books into his own custody, and then Henry Ermen will not be able to help you either.
Schorlemmer will probably visit you on Wednesday or Thurs­ day.
' The Royal Society54 has invited him to read his PAPER on the boiling points of C nH 2n+2 on Thursday and to take part in the debate.
d Since the main chemist there is Frankland, whom Schorlemmer has attacked in all his works, this is a great triumph, and a few more invitations like this WILL BE THE MAKING OF HIM.
I am very happy for the fellow, who has only stayed at his rather pitiful position here because it places at his disposal the laboratory and thus the means of doing theoretical work.
He is really one of the best fellows I have got to know for a long time; he is so totally free of prejudices this freedom appears to be almost spontaneous, but must in fact be based upon much thought.
At the same time, the notable modesty.
Incidentally, he has again made a handsome discovery.
On pages 264 and 297 of his book you will find that propyl alcohol and iso propyl alcohol are two isomeric combina­ tions.
e It had hitherto been impossible to obtain pure propyl alcohol, so the Russians had already claimed that it did not exist, there was only isopropyl alcohol.
Last autumn at the meeting of natural scientists Schorlemmer replied to them: by next autumn he would have obtained it, and he has really done it.
This week I do at last have no more meetings and similar calls upon my time, and will be able to get down to the Fortnightly.

b Two carbuncles on the scrotum would perhaps have made even Sulla peevish.
How greatly that man, despite his more-than-Palmerstonian TEMPER, was affected by his mythical but anyway lousy sickness, is shown by the fact that just 10 days before his death he had the decurion seized in a neighbouring city, and 1 day before he himself croaked had him strangled in his own house.
07 In addition, I have all sorts of trouble.
For example, on the 28th of this month a bill for £15 due at the butcher's, etc.
To my urgent petitions to Holland no answer.
58 Finally I had cajoled myself with the illusion that by this time I would have a 2nd edition,c and thus see money for the first.
But I had added up the bill without the host—I do not mean the Volkswirt, 0 but the Germans in general.
POOR Siebel! In a way he had himself prepared his premature death.
But WITH ALL THAT he was a good fellow.
We are unlucky— Daniels, Wolff, Schramm, Weydemeyer, Siebel, Weerth! Not to speak of the living dead.
As regards The Fortnightly Review,11 I had long considered this point, and had long arranged with Lafargue (the actual negotiator with Beesly) that you should appear under any old nom de guerre, a See this volume, pp.

Beesly himself will not be informed who the man is.
And it is all the same to him.
Apart from other considerations, the impact in Germany would be greatly lessened if the stuff appeared under your name.
In your last letter3 you made a mistake on one point.
The notes used on p.
18652 you yourself wrote late one evening in my notebook, which still exists.
59 The notes of the Russian Ermen,b on the other hand, referred mainly to technical things.
Incidentally, the main thing for me was to ascertain the magnitude of the advanced circulating capital, i.
e.
advanced in raw material, etc.
, and wages, as against the circulating capital turned over.
I have enough STATEMENTS, part of them from manufacturers, handed in either to the COMMISSIONERS c or to private economists.
But everywhere only the annual accounts.
The devil of the thing is that there is a wide divergence in political economy between what is of practical interest and what is theoretically necessary, so that one cannot even find the necessary material, as in other sciences.
I have received cuttings from Berlin newspapers from Eichhoff and sent him cuttings from here in RETURN.
We have also exchanged two letters.
60 But now the enclosed shows, what Borkheim half guessed on his last visit to Berlin, that Eichhoff has let himself into concessions quoad d Stieber.
Probably from sheer stupidity.
For this reason he has taken up political economy as a neutral field.
61 For the rest, it appears that he feels uneasy, and he told Borkheim that, after swotting up properly on economy, he will exchange Berlin for Vienna, i.

The Fortnightly article11 will thus be written as though by an Englishman—that is how I understand you.

Eichhoff has finally terminated his lectures on crises.

On the contrary.
If you were forced, as I am, to read the economic articles of Messrs Lalor, Herbert Spencer, Macleod, etc.
, in The Westminster Review, etc.
, you would see that all of them are fed up with the economic trivialities—and know their readers are fed up, too—so they try to give their scribblings some flavour through PSEUDOPHILOSOPHICAL or PSEUDOSCIEN-TIFIC SLANG.
The pseudocharacter in no way makes the writing (content=0) easy to understand.
On the contrary.
The trick lies in so mystifying the reader and causing him to rack his brain, that he may finally be relieved to discover that these HARD WORDS are only a Demokratisches Wochenblatt 21.
Marx to Engels.
23 May 1868 39 fancy dress for loci communes.
3 Add to this that the readers of the Fortnightly and The Westminster Review flatter themselves that they are the LONGEST HEADS OF ENGLAND (let alone the rest of the world, naturally).
Even apart from that, if you had seen what MR James Hutchinson Stirling dares to present to the public as The Secret of Hegel,h not only in books but also in REVIEWS,—Hegel himself would not understand it—you would realise—Mr J.
H.
Stirling is regarded as a great thinker—that you are really being too timid.
People demand something new, new in form and content.
Since you want to start with Chapter II64 (you must not, however, forget to draw the reader's attention somewhere to the fact that in Chapter I he will find a new treatment of that value and money stuff65) the following should, in my opinion, be used for the beginning, naturally in the form agreeable to you.
In his investigations into CURRENCY Th.
Tookec underlines that money in its function as capital flows back to its starting point (REFLUX OF MONEY TO ITS POINT OF ISSUE), but in its function simply as CURRENCY does not flow back.
This distinction, noted by Sir James Steuart,d among others, long before Tooke, serves the latter simply for a polemic against what the preachers of the CURRENCY PRINCIPLE 6 claim to be the influence the issue of credit money (BANKNOTES, etc.
) exercises upon commodity prices.
Our author, however, makes this peculiar form of circulation of money which functions as capital ('SERVE IN THE FUNCTION OF CAPITAL?, A.
Smithe) the starting point for his investigation into the nature of capital itself, and in the first place for an answer to the question: How is money, this independent form of value, converted into capital? ('CONVERSION INTO CAPITAL' the official expression.
) All sorts of businessmen, says Turgot, 'ont cela de commun qu'ils achètent pour vendre.
.
.
leurs achats sont une avance qui leur rentre'.
1 Buying to sell, this is in fact the transaction in which money functions as capital, and which conditions its reflux to ITS POINT OF ISSUE, in distinction to selling to buy, where it need only function as CURRENCY.
The differing sequence of the acts of SELLING and BUYING imposes upon money two different circulation move­ ments.

Last Wednesday I gave a lecture (ABOUT 5/4 of an hour) on wages (especially the form of the same) to about 100 German PICKED workers.
67 I was very unwell that day, and I was advised to telegraph that I could not come.
However, this was impossible, since some of the people had come from very distant parts of London.
So I went there.
The business went off very well, and after the lecture I felt better than before.
I have made concessions to my family doctor Lafargue in that I have not yet visited the Museum2 again.
But I have perhaps, during the past weeks, meditated too much AT HOME.
I shall, IF POSSIBLE, come to Manchester with Tussychen at the end of next week (SAY SATURDAY13).
But you will have to send me the money for the fares and SOME SHILLINGS which I shall leave for my wife.
Tussychen, OF COURSE, has reminded me of the trip ABOUT every day.

13 Published in English for the Irrst time 24 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 20 JUNE 1868 DEAR FRED, Immediately after my return to London68 —our trip was marvelous—I found whole bundles of dunning and threatening letters.
The people had been turned away with the excuse that I was 'travelling'.
But one might think the electric telegraph had announced my return to these fellows.
Si licet parva componere magnis, b OLD Niebuhr (the father of the HISTORIAN) relates with what speed the FACTS of the SILESIAN WAR 6a travelled from Europe to Asia IN NO TIME simply through the telegraphy of people's tongues.
And among creditors this form of natural telegraphy appears to work even more efficiently.
Among the bills there are various ones that can scarcely be delayed for one week; the worst, however, is the a 29 May -b If one may compare the small with the great 24.
Marx to Engels.
20 June 1868 43 enclosed scrawl payable on Tuesday,3 for, if the GAS SUPPLY is publicly cut off, things will get quite out of control.
Last Tuesday0 there was a meeting of the International.
In the meantime, papers have come into my hands which have made unavoidable a RESCINDING of the RESOLUTIONS AS TO THE CONGRESS.
70 D'abordf the declaration by Minister of Justice Bara that the Congress is not permitted to take place in Brussels.
d Secondly, a printed manifesto of the COMMITTEES of Brussels and Verviers in which they throw down the gauntlet to the Minister.
e Thirdly, letters from De Paepe and Vandenhouten that we would ruin the Association in Belgium by transferring the Congress.
This would be interpreted as a concession to the government, etc.
I do not even mention the lousy intrigues of Vésinier, who is now here, and also Pyat, etc.
Naturally they have been spreading the rumour that we are working at the dictation of Bonaparte.
They believed that a big scandal was to be expected at this last meeting and therefore sent guests to us.
They were very désappointés when I withdrew my RESOLUTIONS after reading and referring to the documents, etc.
I put the matter thus: The law against the FOREIGNERS was in no way a special threat against the International.
It was general.
The International would, however, have made a concession to the Belgian government if, under such legislation, it had selected Brussels as its MEETING PLACE.
NOW the matter was the other way round.
Now that the Belgian govern­ ment had directly threatened and provoked us we would be making a concession to it if we moved the Congress away from Brussels, etc.
At the same time, I made a few very contemptuous jokes about the heroic tone adopted by those who attacked my RESOLUTIONS (Odger, etc.
) before they knew the CHANGED STATE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
THE ONLY DANGER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED, WAS THAT OF CHEAP MARTYRDOM AND RIDICULE.
MRS Law shouted 'HEAR, HEAR' for me several times, and showed her support by drumming on the table.
Anyhow I managed things so that the laughter turned against Odger, etc.
, and that the RESCINDING of the RESOLUTIONS did not appear as a victory on their part.
The heat is very nasty for me.
I shall have Gumpert's medicine made up for me, since I have 'puked' (as Mrs Blind would say) for a 23 June -b 9 June -c First of all -d J.

Tussychen and Jennychen are both unfortunately very unwell— sore throats and vomiting.
If things do not get better TODAY, I shall have to call a doctor.
Our Allen suddenly became paralysed a week ago, so he cannot leave his house.
Vésinier is wrangling here in the FRENCH BRANCH 72 against Dupont and Jung, both of whom he brands 'as Bonapartists'.
During my absence he attended a meeting of the CENTRAL COUNCIL 73 (which he has no right to do) and has written a fantastic report in the Cigale (Brussels paper).
74 The venue of the Congress was just being discussed.

Yesterday BY ACCIDENT I came across a fine passage in A.
Smith.
After he had explained that LABOUR the PRIME COST, etc.
, and nearly said the right things though with constant contradictions; after he had ditto declared: 'THE PROFITS OF STOCK, IT MAY PERHAPS BE THOUGHT, ARE ONLY A DIFFERENT NAME FOR THE WAGES OF A PARTICULAR SORT OF LABOUR, THE LABOUR OF INSPECTION AND DIRECTION.
THEY ARE, HOWEVER, ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT, ARE REGULATED BY QUITE DIFFERENT PRINCIPLES, AND BEAR NO PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY, THE HARDSHIP, OR THE INGENUITY OF THIS SUPPOSED LABOUR OF INSPECTION AND DIRECTION', after that he suddently does an about turn and wants to develop WAGES, PROFIT, RENT, as the 'COMPONENT PARTS OF NATURAL PRICE' (with him = VALUE).
Among other things, there is the following fine passage: a See this volume, p.

24 June 1868 'WHEN THE PRICE OF ANY COMMODITY IS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN WHAT IS SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE RENT OF THE LAND, THE WAGES OF THE LABOUR, AND THE PROFITS OF THE STOCK EMPLOYED IN RAISING, PREPARING AND BRINGING IT TO MARKET, ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL RATES, THE COMMODITY IS THEN SOLD FOR WHAT MAY BE CALLED ITS NATURAL PRICE.
THE COMMODITY IS THEN SOLD PRECISELY FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, OR FOR WHAT IT REALLY COSTS THE PERSON WHO BRINGS IT TO MARKET; FOR THOUGH IN COMMON LANGUAGE THE PRIME COST OF ANY COMMODITY DOES NOT COMPREHEND THE PROFIT OF THE PERSON WHO IS TO SELL IT AGAIN, YET, IF HE SELLS IT AT A PRICE WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW HIM THE ORDINARY RATE OF PROFIT IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD, HE IS EVIDENTLY A LOSER BY THE TRADE; SINCE, BY EMPLOYING HIS STOCK IN SOME OTHER WAY, HE MIGHT HAVE MADE THAT PROFIT.
' (The existence of profit in the 'neighbourhood' as an explanation for the same!) 'His PROFIT, BESIDES, IS HIS REVENUE THE PROPER FUND OF HIS SUBSISTENCE.
As, WHILE HE IS PREPARING AND BRINGING THE GOODS TO MARKET, HE ADVANCES TO HIS WORKMEN THEIR WAGES, OR THEIR SUBSISTENCE; SO HE ADVANCES TO HIMSELF, IN THE SAME MANNER, HIS OWN SUBSISTENCE; WHICH IS GENERALLY SUITABLE TO THE PROFIT WHICH HE MAY REASONA­ BLY EXPECT FROM THE SALE OF HIS GOODS.
UNLESS THEY YIELD HIM THIS PROFIT, THEREFORE, THEY DO NOT REPAY HIM WHAT THEY MAY VERY PROPERLY BE SAID TO HAVE COST HIM.
'3 This second manner of pressing the profit into the PRIME COST—because already consumed—is really fine.
The same man, in whom the organs of pissing and generation also coincide mentally, 75 stated previously: 'AS SOON AS STOCK HAS ACCUMULATED IN THE HANDS OF PARTICULAR PERSONS .

I therefore saw him again today and asked him whether he could recommend a doctor, since Allen was sick.
He said the main thing was to have a man who, even if not excessively CLEVER, should really live nearby, should come 3-4 times a day at critical times, and always be on call.
In his opinion, Lafargue is quite capable of handling this case properly, and if you want further assistance, a of The Fortnightly Review -b turn (the postscript is on the back of the sheet) -c pet name for Marx's daughter Jenny 33.
Marx to Engels.
27 June 1868 51 Allen would be the best man to recommend one of the doctors in the vicinity.
Apart from this, fresh air and PLENTY OF IT is the main thing; he himself usually prescribes washing with vinegar and water and disinfection of the house with chloride of lime; all this cannot, however, be decreed from a distance.
In such acute sicknesses medicines are not really much use.
You will have received the second ten pounds in 2 fivers which I sent you the day before yesterday.
Enclosed a further five pounds S/K 46 795, and next week I shall send you some more.
Incidentally, Gumpert did comfort me greatly and he confirmed that this year this sickness occurs in an exceptionally mild form.
Lizzie is afraid that you might think that Tussy could have caught the germ of the sickness here and she has urged me to write that everybody here is healthy.

The children are getting along very well.
The suppuration and swelling of the throat has improved so much that today the doctor prescribed a hearty DINNER for them (hitherto they had only port and Liebigb).
They consumed the DINNER with ZEST.
From the beginning Korklow prescribed air.
Instead of the CHLORIDE OF LIME 52 another (newer) disinfectant, since he regards the former as injurious to the lungs.
Luckily our house is built in such a way, and in particular the children's rooms are so situated, that they are plentifully provided with ventilation coming from every side.
Tell MRS LIZZY (TO WHOM TUSSY SENDS HER LOVE) that Manchester was not for a moment held responsible here.
SCARLATINA and MEASLES are now epidemic in London.
Tussy probably CAUGHT THE INFECTION FROM THE DAUGHTER OF PROFESSOR FRANKLAND.
Best greetings to Lizzy from me.

Dr Korklow, to whom I showed the SUMMONS today, said that it WAS AN HONOUR MUCH VALUED BY THE PHILISTINES OF ST.

I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT I WAS A FOREIGNER AND THAT THEY SHOULD KISS ME ON THE ARSE.

The second and final article71 (the first goes up to the conclusion of absolute surplus value) can then be finished by the end of this inst.

Lafargue, as your squire, can invent his uniform himself.
As you see, the Pancratian philistines insist that you should sacrifice yourself for the common good.
And this year-long, touching attachment which nothing could shake—this you intend to reciprocate with the cold negation of KISS MY—? But 'that's just like the communists'.
Give Jennychen my heartiest greetings and tell her that since she has now finally had a fever, I would like to have heard her speaking in delirium; there would have been more sense and poetry in it than fat Freiligrath will ever develop.

Yesterday for the first time they were outside for half an hour.
The peeling is still very pronounced.
Only when this is finished will they be MOVABLE.
During the past few days I have been pressed very hard by the baker, CHEESEMONGER, ASSESSED TAXES, God and the Devil.
You will recall that the German Workers' Educational Society here has celebrated the June Insurrection88 for ABOUT 18 years now.
Only in the last few years have the French (their society here now exists as the FRENCH BRANCH of the International72 ) taken part.
And the old meneurs* always stayed away.
I mean the petits grands hommes.
h But this year, IN PUBLIC MEETING, along came Mr Pyat and read out an alleged address of the Paris Commune (this is a euphemism for the IDENTICAL Pyat, who is in no way inferior to Blind in this LINE) in which the assassinat of Bonaparte was preached, as it was years ago in his Lettre aux étudians.
c The FRENCH BRANCH, reinforced by other bawlers, acclaimed this.
Vesinier had it printed in Cigale 4 and Espiègle? Belgian PAPERS, and presents Pyat as giving his direction to the 'International'.
89 As a result, we get a letter from the Brussels committee,90 which just at the moment is making great propaganda, under difficult circumstances (Charleroi affair 4).
Contents: This demonstration threatens to wreck the entire Association on the continent.
Will the FRENCH BRANCH never move forward from the old demagogic phrases, etc.
? etc.

It should be remembered that, at this very time, our people are behind bars in Paris.

Our Association is a thorn in their flesh.
After trying in vain to work against the Association, THE NEXT BEST THING, of course, is to compromise it.
Pyat is just the man to do this de bonne foi.
" The cleverer ones therefore push him forward.
What could be funnier than this squint-eyed melodrama-writer and Charivari man before 1848, this TOASTM ASTER of 1848 who now plays Brutus, but from a safe distance! The FRENCH BRANCH here will have to be thrown out of the International if it does not put a stop to its asininity.
One cannot allow 50 unprincipled louts, round whom loudmouths of all nationalities gather at such public opportunities, to endanger the International Association at a moment when, as a result of conditions on the continent, it is beginning to become a serious power.

10 July 1868 Ad vocem3 Pyat, Blind must not be forgotten.
I believe I told you that the Bradford Schiller Society (id est Dr Bronner) approached the Schiller Institute 76 here, in order to organise there, here, and in Liverpool 'Readings by famous Germans living in England'.
I told the people right away that the whole thing revolved round Karl Blind; all the same they should, as far as I was concerned, agree to the plan sous réserve h in order to see for themselves.
So, last week a letter arrived from Bradford with further information.
It said approaches had been made to Prof.
Goldstücker, Max Müller, K.
Blind and A.
Ruge\ The first two had accepted, yet only sous réserve with regard to their time and health, but the latter two had accepted immediately and unconditionally, and Ruge had immediately asked whether an historical or philosophical theme would be preferred.
In short, the bomb had burst, and the gentlemen received the reply that Goldstücker and Max Müller would be quite acceptable here, but there could be no question of Blind and Ruge.
And this puts paid to the attempt.
Beustc has once again made himself suspicious in my eyes.
The serious attempt of the Russians to have the Eastern business explode this spring, in spite of the fact that their railway was not yet finished, only appears explicable in that they wished to exploit the presence of a Palmerston as Austrian Prime Minister as long as it lasted.
According to one version, he told the Czechs, incidental­ ly, that he was in possession of plans which had been agreed between Prussia and Russia for the eventuality of the dissolution of Austria, and that under these plans Bohemia would not become Russian, but would be sacrificed by the Russians.
I have read the conclusion of the Prussian war of 1866 (Main campaign).
"1 According to it, the South Germans were even more stupid than one had thought and known; the blame is, incidental­ ly, distributed more evenly, so that Charlemagne of Bavariae appears as at least as great an ass as Alexander the Great of Hesse/ Best greetings to your wife, the girls and the Lafargues.

11 July 1868 diamond is given in the following truly commercial-traveller-type conversation: 'Monsieur, cédez-moi votre diamant.
— Monsieur, je veux bien; cédez-moi en échange votre travail de toute une année.
' 3 Instead of the business friend answering: 'Mon cher, si j'étais condamné à travailler, vous comprenez bien que j'aurai autre chose à acheter que des diamants'^ he says: 'Mais, monsieur, vous n'avez pas sacrifié à votre acquisition une minute.
—Eh bien, monsieur, tâchez de rencontrer une minute semblable.
— Mais, en bonne justice, nous devrions échanger à travail égal.
—Non, en bonne justice, vous appréciez vos services et moi les miens.
Je ne vous force pas; pourquoi me forceriez-vous? Donnez-moi un an tout entier, ou cherchez vous même un diamant.
— Mais cela m'en entraînerait à dix ans de pénibles recherches, sans compter une déception probable au bout.
Je trouve plus sage, plus profitable d'employer ces dix ans d'une autre manière.
—C'est justement pour cela que je crois vous rendre encore service en ne vous demandant qu'un an.
Je vous en épargne neuf, et voilà pourquoi j'attache beaucoup de valeur à ce service.
' 0 Is it not a wine salesman to the very life? Incidentally—and the German Bastiatites do not know this— that unhappy assertion that the value of commodities is deter­ mined, not by the labour they cost, but by the labour which they spare the buyer (the babbling about the connection between exchange and the division of labour is childish talk) is just as little Bastiat's discovery as any of the other of his wine-salesman categories.
The old jackass Schmalz, the Prussian demagogue-catcher, 95 says (German edition 1818, French 1826): 'Le travail d'autrui en général ne produit jamais pour nous qu'une économie de temps, et cette économie de temps est tout ce qui constitue sa valeur et son prix.
Le menuisier, par exemple, qui me fait une table, et le domestique qui porte mes lettres à la poste, qui bat mes habits, ou qui cherche pour moi les choses qui me sont nécessaires, me rendent l'un et l'autre un service absolument de même nature: l'un et l'autre m'épargne et le temps que je serais obligé d'employer moi-même à mes [ces] occupations, et celui qu'il m'aurait fallu consacrer à m'acquérir l'aptitude et les talents qu'elles exigent.
' d a 'Monsieur, give me your diamond.
—Gladly, monsieur; give me in exchange your work for a whole year.
' -b 'My dear Sir, if I were condemned to work, you will understand that I would have something other to buy than diamonds.
'-c'But monsieur, you did not sacrifice a minute for your acquisition.
—All right, monsieur, try to find a similar minute.
—But, in fairness, we should exchange equal labour.
—No, in fairness, you should put a value on your services, and I on mine.
I am not forcing you; why would you force me? Give me a whole year or look for a diamond yourself.
—But that would involve me in ten years exhausting search, quite apart from the probable disappointment at the end.
I find it wiser and more profitable to employ these ten years in a different manner.
—That is exactly why I believe I am indeed doing you a service when I only demand one year from you.
I save you nine, and that is why I attach a high value to this service.

11 July 1868 important.
93 All he has achieved is that, if a second edition appears, I shall aim a few necessary blows at Bastiat where I speak about the magnitude of value.
" This wasn't done before, since the 3rd volume41 will contain a separate and extensive chapter about the 'vulgar economy' gentry.
100 Incidentally, you will find it quite natural that Faucher and consorts derive the 'exchange value' of their own scribblings not from the amount of labour power expended, but from the absence of such expenditure, that is from 'saved labour'.
Moreover, the worthy Bastiat did not even himself make this 'discovery', so welcome to these gentry, but just 'cribbed' it, in his usual manner, from much earlier authors.
His sources are of course unknown to Faucher and consorts.
As for the Centralblatt, the man is making the greatest concession possible by admitting that, if value means anything at all, then my conclusions must be conceded.
3 The unfortunate fellow does not see that, even if there were no chapter on 'value' at all in my book,65 the analysis I give of the real relations would contain the proof and demonstration of the real value relation.
The chatter about the need to prove the concept of value arises only from complete ignorance both of the subject under discussion and of the method of science.
Every child knows that any nation that stopped working, not for a year, but let us say, just for a few weeks, would perish.
And every child knows, too, that the amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs demand differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society's aggregate labour.
It is SELF-EVIDENT that this necessity of the distribution of social labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the specific form of social production; it can only change its form of manifestation.
Natural laws cannot be abolished at all.
The only thing that can change, under historically differing conditions, is the form in which those laws assert themselves.
And the form in which this proportional distribution of labour asserts itself in a state of society in which the interconnection of social labour expresses itself as the private exchange of the individual products of labour, is precisely the exchange value of these products.
Where science comes in is to show how the law of value asserts itself.
So, if one wanted to 'explain' from the outset all phenomena a This refers to the review, in Literarisches Centralblatt für Deutschland, No.

Marx to Kugelmann.
11 July 1868 69 that apparently contradict the law, one would have to provide the science before the science.
It is precisely Ricardo's mistake that in his first chapter, on value,3 all sorts of categories that still have to be arrived at are assumed as given, in order to prove their harmony with the law of value.
On the other hand, as you correctly believe, the history of the theory of course demonstrates that the understanding of the value relation has always been the same, clearer or less clear, hedged with illusions or scientifically more precise.
Since the reasoning process itself arises from the existing conditions and is itself a natural process, really comprehending thinking can always only be the same, and can vary only gradually, in accordance with the maturity of development, hence also the maturity of the organ that does the thinking.
Anything else is drivel.
The vulgar economist has not the slightest idea that the actual, everyday exchange relations and the value magnitudes cannot be directly identical.
The point of bourgeois society is precisely that, a priori, no conscious social regulation of production takes place.
What is reasonable and necessary by nature asserts itself only as a blindly operating average.
The vulgar economist thinks he has made a great discovery when, faced with the disclosure of the intrinsic interconnection, he insists that things look different in appearance.
In fact, he prides himself in his clinging to appearances and believing them to be the ultimate.
Why then have science at all? But there is also something else behind it.
Once interconnection has been revealed, all theoretical belief in the perpetual necessity of the existing conditions collapses, even before the collapse takes place in practice.
Here, therefore, it is completely in the interests of the ruling classes to perpetuate the unthinking confusion.
And for what other reason are the sycophantic babblers paid who have no other scientific trump to play except that, in political economy, one may not think at all! But satis superque.
b In any case, it shows the depth of degradation reached by these priests of the bourgeoisie: while workers and even manufacturers and merchants have understood my book and made sense of it, these 'learned scribes' (!) complain that I make excessive demands on their comprehension.

21 July 1868 71 46 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 21 July 1868 Dear Moor, I concluded from Tussy's letter the receipt of the £10, and also that both patients3 must have reached the point at which they should be sent to the SEASIDE, the sooner the better.
So that there shall be no delay I enclose £25 (1 of 20 and 1 of 5).
It is still uncertain when I shall get away from here, and it will therefore be better for the time being to drop the attempt at a combined SEASIDE operation, so that the girls' health may not suffer.
I believe you said recently that Borkheim himself would be inclined to advance the £150 if he was not at the moment short of money.
Is he now perhaps in a position to provide the sum, or at least £100? It would be absolute folly to toss into the maw of this miserable society 20% interest per annum against the finest security.
Even if Borkheim can get us only £100, of which £50 might be repaid in case of need in January or February and the rest on 10/20 July 1869 (though it would be best if the whole sum need not be repaid until next July), everything could be fixed up easily.
He really only needs to commit himself to pay £100 on the loan in September, so that I would then only need to send him the remainder.
This would free £100 for me, which I could send you right now.
If nothing of this sort happens, you will understand that I am very tied, as long as the heavy load of £175 is hanging over my head, and especially as long as I do not know how the balance has come out, and I probably won't know for another 3-4 weeks.
Think over the business with Borkheim.
Maybe something can be done; if so we would be, at least for the time being, out of all our troubles, and would once again have gained time.

r jo jo Published in English for the first time 47 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER London, 23 July 1868 DEAR FRED, BEST THANKS for the £25.
The children will probably go to the sea next week together with MR and MRS Lafargue.
Since yesterday Lafargue has been ' MEMBER OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS' and has received his patent for the KILLING OF MEN AND BEASTS.
Then, in 4-5 weeks, he will go to Paris.
As a result, we are in a very embarrassing position, since my wife still has to buy linen for Laura for at least £20.
I do not think we can do any business with Borkheim.
Yesterday he told me that ' money was very tight' in his case, etc.
The Dutchmen, of whom I can, in fact, only use August Philips, are travelling.
But I shall use my head to see how and where to get a loan, since it is absolutely necessary.
The practice of borrowing at 20% can in fact only happen with institutions like those utilised by Borkheim, where people lose the capital advanced if one kicks the bucket before the date of maturity.
About Dr Boruttau, the man with the sultry prick, I know nothing except that he also ' runs with' the Lassalleans (Schweitzer FRACTION).
The funniest thing is the ' French' of his dedication to a sympathetic soul in Moscow.
103 You will have seen that my booka forms a point of discussion in a the first volume of Capital the programme of the General Association of German Workers.
3,04 I have sent you a scrawl by Dühring which despite the heat you might read.
You could also tell me your impressions of it, since it is certainly not overtaxing.
But all the more boring, to be sure.
I saw Prof.
Beesly last week at Lafargue's.
Beesly was absent when your article11 arrived.
Immediately after his return he received it and sent it to Henry Morleyb (CHIEF EDITOR of The Fortnightly Review) in Scotland, from whence we have received no further NEWS as yet.
How do you live in this heat? I lose all capacity for thought, and without Gumpert's medicine I COULD NOT STAND IT AT ALL.

If I HAD MADE UP MY MIND where on the continent I could just now depend with certainty upon a LOAN (especially since I would, if necessary, have your guarantee), I would cross over and take Jennychen with me.
But this is perhaps the best time of the year to find nobody at home.
There have been all sorts of scandals here RELATING TO Pyat, FRENCH BRANCH72 and GENERAL COUNCIL.
On this tomorrow.
b Today only this.
Schweitzer in his 2nd programme for the congress of the General Association of German Workers in Hamburg has an item about the International Working Men's Association and another about my book.
c The programme was printed in the Zukunft 6104 and elsewhere.
On the other hand, A.
Bebel, as president of the Workers' Union meeting in Nuremberg, has sent an invitation to the General Council.
108 We should send a delegate (Eccarius will go).
That they will join the International Working Men's Association and adopt our programme is already certain, he says.
Finally, we have received an invitation from Vienna where the Austrian workers' fraternal festival will be held, also at the beginning of September.
109 We have sent to Fox, who is in Vienna, the authorisation to represent us there.
About the private negotiations between Wilhelmchen and Schweitzer e I know no more than the former writes.
Yet I know from another source that the influence of that cunning fox Schweitzer has grown to the same extent as Wilhelmchen has discredited himself among the workers by his over-close alliance with the South German provincial pettifoggers.
It was evidently for this reason that Wilhelm found it necessary to set up a sort of cartel with Schweitzer, who is at present inside and who, moreover, was clever enough to have his title of nobility revoked by the Prussian court 'for lèse-majesté'} 10 As far as I am concerned — I mean as MEMBER of the GENERAL COUNCIL—I must a by heart -b See this volume, pp.

It is their business and not mine whom they have as leader.
As SECRETARY FOR GERMANY I must answer all those who apply to me in their official capacity as presidents, etc.
, of workers' groups.
In this sense, I have also written to Schweitzer (always WITH AN EYE to the possible publication of the entire correspondence).
111 Faced with the intrigues of the old '48 democrats here, it was, however, high time to be able to display influence among the German workers in Germany.
That you, poor devil, with your sore eye, should also have to water the Gartenlaube —and in this weather, too—really cries to the heavens.

112 The FACT was actually this! For us the government sent, instead of the city censor, a special fellow from Berlin (Mr von St.
Paul, etc.
).
When even this did not help, yet another tier of censorship, that of the Regierungspräsident of Cologne, 11 was added.
Finally, the Berlin cabinet, driven wild, issued a sort of manifesto against us, apprising the world of all our offences, and concluding with the announcement that at the end of the quarter they would shut up our shop.
I resigned because the shareholders—even if in vain, as it later turned out—tried to negotiate with the Prussian government.
Page 3 (2x).
It would perhaps be good to add here for the benefit of the philistines that the provisional government had invited me in writing to return to France.
c Ditto page 3 (x3).
You might add for the benefit of the democratic philistines that the Prussians expelled me par ordre du Muphti, d after they had failed in the law courts.
113 Finally, would it not be better, instead of the title: 'A German Political Economist', to have: 'A German Socialist'? Both are 'hideous', but the former probably more so.

106 The business is splendid, that is, if it can be done and Kertbény is not bragging.
b The enclosed scribble has been composed, as far as possible, in the spirit of the rag,c but it should possibly be made milder here and there.
Marx thinks the title 'A German Socialist"1 would be better, which would be very nice, if Monsieur Kertbény did not object; but this must be prevented above all, so I find your suggestion, being the 'milder' one, is better.
114 Marx has, for the time being, kept your letter with him, and since it is already late today anyway, and everybody in the hotel is hurrying to bed, I shall have to answer it next week.
I put Lupus' photogram aside for you some time ago; luckily it is still one of the old good prints; recently I had another 24 prints made, but in the meantime the negative had faded so much that they turned out very badly.
As for me, a blood vessel burst in the conjunctiva of my left eye a fortnight ago, and left behind a red patch on the apple (south-west side) which has not yet vanished, and with which I would not like to be eternised.
So you will just have to wait for a while.

4 August 1868 51 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 4 August 1868 DEAR FRED, How is your eye? You will probably have received the Eichhoff stuff.
3 In the Zukunft there are 'Economic Letters' b singing the praises of my book.
0 In fact these letters are largely cribbed from the book.
In the Social-Demokrat the Executive of the General Association of German Workers is urged by the presidium to invite me as a guest of honour to the congress at Hamburg at the end of August.
d A few days ago I wrote to Meissner 84 to find out at last where and how.
Kugelmann has written me a few lines saying that the chamber of commerce and the polytechnical school in Hanover have ordered a number of copies of my book.
In the meantime, I am really more BOTHERED by PRIVATE ECONOMY or, as the English say, DOMESTIC ECONOMY, than by political economy.
My LANDLORD has dunned me and, unfortunately for me, is staying FOR SOME TIME AT London.
I have also been forced to sign diverse smaller bills of exchange, etc.
The filthy French branch72 has created a fine scandal for us.
The Pyatists have published a blâme e of the conseil général in the Cigale.
Their channel was the infamous Vésinier.
We ignored this VOTE OF CENSURE and simply passed à l'ordre du jour.
1 There followed a MEETING of the FRENCH BRANCH where there were fisticuffs.
Dupont, Jung, Laf argue, Johannard, Lassassie and various others have quit this gang of scoundrels.
This rabble now amounts to a total of perhaps 15 persons, although they confront us as the 'souveraineté du peuplé ? We are 'des endormeurs', 'des ambitieux', b etc.

Now, when the Germans will join the 'INTERNATIONAL WORKINGMENS ASSOCIATION' en masse, with the Association, for the time being, filling out at least the boundaries of its main territory— though it is still thin on the ground—my plan is that the GENERAL COUNCIL should move to Geneva for the next year117 and that we should function here only as the BRITANNIC COUNCIL.

Today it is raining, the air is muggy and saturated with humidity, it is therefore doubly horrible, the sweat does not evaporate and you are damp all over.
Last Fridayb I took Lizzie and M.
Ellen0 to Bridlington Quay and returned on Monday; tomorrow I shall return there with Moore, and I would take my HOLIDAY and stay the week, but Charles d has gout and is all in, so I must do his work as well as my own, and there can be no question of going away.
Eichhoff 's pamphlet 6 proves something which I had scarcely credited him with—that he is capable of reporting facts objective­ ly.
Of course, you had also made it easy for him.
The thing will have a very good effect.
Now as regards the transfer to Geneva, it reminds me of the Central Authority's move to Cologne.
118 I would think this coup over very thoroughly.
First, are the few jackasses worth it that you should take this step for their sake and hand over responsibility for the whole thing to people who, for all their good will, and also probably instinct, just do not have the stuff to lead a movement like this? Second, once we start moving house, and the holy respect for London, which is still the Medina of the emigration, has been replaced by a very doubtful respect for Geneva—what is the guarantee that the Proudhonists will not succeed in one fine day having the Council transferred, if only as a What do you think about this? -b 31 July -c Lydia (Lizzie) and Mary Ellen Burns -d Charles Roesgen -e W.

I sent Kugelmann the biographical stuff on Friday from York.
106 It is a very good thing that something about your bookc should now simultaneously appear in French papers, too.
Nota bene, have at least 20-30 reprints made of my article in the Fortnightly 11 (for which we will naturally pay, s'il le faut d), they can be used very well.
ANYHOW, the conspiracy of silence is now over, and if the thing is only blazing a path slowly, it is now doing it surely.

At the moment it is impossible to get money from the UNIONS here for foreign STRIKES.
1 The various data about the Linden factory contained in the latest Hanoverian papers sent me are of great interest to me.
My family is, at present, at the seaside, which was all the more necessary since both GIRLS'1 seemed very delicate after their illness.
Lafargue, after passing his SURGEON examinations here in London, will operate as assistant at his hospital for a few weeks, and then move to Paris where, however, he will still have to pass the French medical examinations.
121 At the moment I am more occupied with PRIVATE than with PUBLIC ECONOMY.
Engels has offered to be my guarantor for a loan of £100-150 at 5% interest, the first half payable in January, the second in July.
So far, however, I have not been able to find a creditor.
I hope 'verry' much that the state of my work will allow me to abandon London for good and all and move to the continent next year, at the end of September.

12 August 1868 56 ENGELS TO MARX 48 IN LONDON [Manchester,] 12 August 1868 Dear Moor, It would be worth the trouble to find out more about Mr Morley's motives,a even if this only leads to the conclusion that the petty, lousy cliquishness, which we used to assume only existed in Germany, also flourishes here.
If Morley refuses the piece"9 despite Beesly's influence, then he has his reasons.
These men are, au fona\ b bourgeois, and MR Morley has all the reasons in the world to prevent giving publicity to things like those you have presented in your analysis.
These are no isms; THAT KNOCKS HIM ON THE HEAD, and hence the lack of space.
Still, I have no fear that we shall therefore be unable to present the book c to the English public, but the easiest and simplest way is cut off, and we shall have to search until we find a new one.
In the meantime, the French articles will produce their effect,"6 and it would be a good thing if they could be shown to the gentlemen of the Fortnightly; it would be very nice if Mr Morley could still be forced to accept the piece.
The day after tomorrow I shall probably go for 10 days to Bridlington Quay (address: Mr Burns, 3 Burlington Place, Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire), since Charlesd is recovering; but, of course, something may still crop up, in which case I shall write to you.

13 August 1868 85 DEAR FRED, 57 MARX TO ENGELS 124 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 13 August 1868 I hope that these lines will reach you before your departure, for there is periculum in mora.
3 Firstly, I must send money to Ramsgate, so they can stay there another week.
As their departure was delayed for weeks after your last remittance, smaller domestic debts were paid; on the other hand, my wife had to retrieve watches and other things from the pawnshop so that they could appear RESPECTABLE at the watering place.
Secondly, one of the épiciers? who is owed £6 and a few shillings, must be paid this week, since the man is shutting up shop.
Thirdly, I have already received 2 SUMMONS for QUEENS TAXES (about £8).
The LOCAL TAXES are paid, as you know.
I absolutely cannot put off these sums.
For two further pressing items—the LANDLORD, who is unfortu­ nately in London now, and a bill of exchange for £12 payable on the 25th of this month—I shall still perhaps receive money in time from Germany.
I have written to my cousins August and Karl Philips in Amsterdam and Aachen in order to find out whether they are back.
125 It would be a sheer waste of money to go to the continent in order to borrow, before one is sure that the people are there.
For the past week I have not had a wink of sleep and l'illustre Gaudissart c Borkheim, who visited me the day before yesterday to take leave, said I really should get rid of my jaundice.
He entertained me with the story of the £1,000 he is trying to blackmail out of Oppenheim.

58 ENGELS TO MARX 124 IN LONDON [Manchester, about 14 August 1868] Dear Moor, I shall send you money tomorrow, our cashier had no more notes this afternoon.
Do not feel awkward about 'pressing', I only wish there were more there to be pressed out; but bear in mind as well that in 6 weeks we shall have to pay the £150 with interest, and Borkheim says that the interest will bring the total up to 165! I think you will have to make up your mind to go to Holland; we cannot 'afford' to borrow at such interest.
Faucher made me laugh very much.
83 Absolutely the noble arrogance of this fellow.
The patronising introduction and then criticism (and what criticism!) of a very elementary thing in which you present the views of the economists, thus only make a resume; he wisely keeps his fingers off your own things.
Also very good is his admission that the present generation, including Faucher, knows nothing of either Jacob or Joseph, thus confirming your opinion that they 'really have learned nothing'.
Incidentally, the impudence of the fellow is comic.
He really assumes that his public knows nothing, will learn nothing, and even wishes to read nothing except such Faucherist piss.
And the man is right about it.

So far I have not yet received anything from the continental side.

Sebastian Seiler, the only worthy historiographer of this tragicomedy—he will hang himself that he missed this putrid scene.
En attendant' it is quite amusing that the 'testamentary successor of Lassalle' 12' declares him an aristocrat, traitor and cad, and is forced to appropriate all those things that we formerly had published against him himself and against Schweitzer.
128 Bastards! On Wednesday or Thursday5 I shall go back to Manchester from here and shall then visit my mother for a week—probably in Ostend.
I am still waiting for a letter from her, and have no idea where I stand in the meantime.
129 Naturally I would have sent the money for the loan from the insurance company only to you, if you had not from the start shoved the whole affair away from you and onto Borkheim, so that I had to turn to him simply to find out how much had to be paid.
That I could, of course, only do with the simultaneous remark that I would send the sum to him, since he was indeed standing surety for the money.
As I already wrote to you, it would never have occurred to me to send the money to that jackass Schyler.

26 August 1868 89 61 MARX TO ENGELS 33 IN MANCHESTER London, 26 August 1868 DEAR FRED, Still no 'SUPPLIES' from Germany.
It is, of course, idiotic to depend completely upon half-promises.
But if you are drowning you clutch at every straw.
On Friday 3 the bill of exchange for £12, about which I wrote to you,b is due.
Since nothing had arrived by today, and to have no protest in the house, I just visited my baker, who told me he could 'perhaps' get the money by tomorrow evening, but only for a few days.
At the same time, I have received the enclosed scrawl from my LANDLORD.
That everything should happen to one just at this time.
It is enough to drive one mad.
Bring me back or send me the screed by Becker.
c His theoretical-political-economic criticisms of Lassalle have been copied from your pamphlet on the military question.
d This Becker has done us a great service with his Seileriana.
He deserves to be Lassalle's 'testamentary successor'.
127 The invitation which I received to the congress of the General Association of German Workers (Hamburg, 22-25 August)130 is signed by Schweitzer as President and by more than 20 workers from different districts of Germany (members of the Executive Committee).
I had to take the latter into consideration in my reply.
c I explained that I could not come because of the work of the Central Council of the International Working Men's Association, and said I was glad to see that the starting points of any 'serious' workers' movement—agitation for complete political freedom, regulation of the working day and international co-operation of the working class—were emphasised in their programme for the congress.

Tussy had a great shock today.
She found Dicky dead in his cage although he was still singing merrily yesterday.
He has been buried with full honours.
Dupont has received the mandate from Naples to represent the Neapolitan branch.
132 Since the Mentana business, as we see from Italian reports, there has been a general reactionary trend in domestic affairs, and in particular the workers' right to meet and form societies has almost been done away with.
1 In Paris, happily, we still have our old people, behind bars.
The committee there will send a délégué to Brussels, but against that the various corps de métier* will send 8-9.
134 Our people have written to us from prison suggesting that these corps de métier MEN should be 'compromised politically' so that there should be no way back for them.
Just to show the sort of.
methods to which the Paris police have recourse: A gentleman calling himself 'Eugène Dupont' from London visited the wives of several of the prisoners to pump them.
He was a police agent, but his play-acting did not work anywhere.
Eccarius left for Nuremberg as our délégué today.
135 From there he will go to Brussels.
He is correspondent of The Times in both cases.
136 The so-called branche française, 72 under the leadership of Messrs Pyat and Vésinier, is sending a delegate to Brussels in order— horribile dictu h — to put us in the dock! Apropos.
If Moore is still there, tell him it would be good if he could pay to me his USUAL CONTRIBUTION to the INTERNATIONAL WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATION by Tuesday.
11 We are weakly represented in Brussels, and every shilling that we can raise now will be used to a trade societies-15 horrible to say-c 1 September 92 send one MEMBER MORE there.

10 September 1868 Until now—AS FAR AS ENGLAND IS CONCERNED—there has been nothing to discredit it.
If the Belgians and French should once again place masses of new stuff on the agenda, let them know it will not do, 141 since 1.
the Germans are very poorly represented, as their congresses are being held almost simultaneously in Germany 142; 2.
England is almost not represented because of the suffrage movement; 3.
the German Swiss are not yet represented at all, since they have only just affiliated, and those branches long in existence have exhausted their funds in the Geneva strike 16; 4.
the discussions are being conducted one-sidedly, in French; 5.
therefore, decisions on general theoretical questions must be avoided, since this can only lead to protests later from the non-Belgians and non-French.
The public is naturally interested mainly in the question of war.
Pompous declamations and high-faluting phrases do no HARM here.
The decision to be taken in this connection would seem to be simply that the working class is not yet sufficiently organised to throw any decisive weight onto the scales; that, however, the congress protests in the name of the working class, and denounces those who instigate war; that a war between France and Germany is a civil war, ruinous for both countries and for Europe as a whole.
A statement that war could only benefit the Russian government can hardly be made acceptable to the French and Belgian gentlemen.
3 Greetings to friend Becker.
b K.
Marx If the question of credit mutuel is raised, Eccarius should simply declare that the workers in England, Germany and the United States have nothing to do with Proudhonist dogmas and consider the credit question to be of secondary importance.
The resolutions of the congress should be telegraphed to the London newspapers.
So don't do anything discreditable.

12 September 1868 95 67 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER London, 12 September 1868 DEAR FRED, Luckily the congress138 ends today and up to Thursday3 —that is as far as the news goes—it had only compromised itself tolerably.
But one must always fear some public disgrace, since the Belgians form the enormous majority.
Mr Tolain and other Parisians want to have the GENERAL COUNCIL moved to Brussels.
They are very JEALOUS OF London.
It is a great step forward that the Proudhonist 'braves Belges' h and French, who dogmatically de­ claimed against TRADES UNIONS, etc.
, in Geneva (1866) and Lausanne (1867), 143 are now most fanatically in favour.
In spite of all their boasting, the 'braves Beiges' had made no preparations.
For example, the correspondent of The Daily News hunted in vain for 3 days for the possible meeting place until he accidentally ran into Jung and Stepney.
In fact, the premises had not been booked in advance, and the 'braves Beiges' wanted to charge the expenses (among others, those for their 250 participants) to the London GENERAL COUNCIL, to which they and the French owe about 3,000 frs.
The sum is now being raised by private collections among the delegates.
I am in a bad scrape.
Laura has fallen sick since you were here,129 and my wife was forced to borrow £10 from her simply to meet the extra expenses, as we are absolutely broke.
I have heard nothing at all from Holland0 and must therefore regard the silence as intentional.
I really do not know what to do.
Apropos.
It was a good thing that we changed the word CONVICTS into VICTIMS.

11 This is the first time that it has abandoned its tone of moquerie about the working class, and taken it 'verry' au sérieux.
Spread this around.
Inform Jessup of this.
I must reply to both your letters, the first to me and the 2nd to Eccarius, which was handed me in his absence (he has not yet returned from Brussels).
As far as the first letter is concerned, it is your fault if Sorge (who is completely unknown to me) has received credentials.
144 If you wanted simply to give him a recommendation for a particular purpose, you should have written so clearly.
The way you put it in your letter, I believed that Sorge was your and A.
Vogt's man.
So be more careful in future.
Then you made the second mistake of giving the credentials to Sorge, instead of writing to me first about the misunderstanding! The mistake has been made, but it is not irreparable.

So write to me whether you and A.

Write, too, in which manner we should withdraw Sorge's credentials or, alternatively, inform him that the new General Council has changed the credentials.
145 Drury was here for a while.
Recently, shortly before the Brussels Congress, he was proposed as authorised agent of the INTERNATIONAL WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATION to the AMERICAN LABOR UNION146 and its congress.
We did not agree to this at the time, since the source of the suggestiona appeared suspicious to us.
Please observe the man more closely first, either yourself or through friends.
No COPIES remain of the Commonwealth PAPER.
For the past few years there have not been any agitational writings in our sense in England.
My bookb has not yet been translated into English.
147 Eccarius, otherwise very capable, but at the same time very AMBITIOUS, has intentionally not mentioned it in The Commonwealth or at other opportunities.
He likes to appropriate my propositions for himself.
At the congress in Brussels, Lessner mentioned my book in his speech about machinery.
The correspondent of The Daily News reported this.
c Eccarius, who reported the congress sessions for The Times, suppressed it.
136 His conduct is all the more absurd since he owes me not only his knowledge, but also his post as general secretary on the GENERAL COUNCIL.
I alone supported him (at The Commonwealth too) against attacks by the English and French.
148 He relies upon the experience he already has with me, that I am only concerned with the cause, and ignore personal stupidities! I shall not give him your letter.
The more English excerpts from my book you can get into the American press the better.

16 September 1868 The congress went well after all.
The method of conducting the babble in public and the BUSINESS on the quiet has worked splendidly.

One might also send Meissner the No.

16 September 1868 101 The policy of sending the report solely to The Times has proved itself.
13 It has forced all London newspapers to speak, with the exception of the deeply-indignant Levy.
3 The Times did not accept Eccarius' reports from Nuremberg.
It only took the bait after it had received the report from me.
b The Morning Advertiser of yesterday carried (upsetting Blind) A FIRST LEADER in favour of the International against The Times.
c The Star declares the congress to have been a •SUCCESS:6 The Standard, which first attacked us, SNEAKS before the WORKING CLASS in a leading article yesterday.
6 It knocks the capitalists and will now even pull grimaces about the LAND QUESTION.
The Journal des Débats regrets that the English and the Germans and the Belgians, as shown by the resolution on the land, 152 belong to the 'secte communiste' and that the French, on the other hand, keep on reproducing 'les déclamations ridicules de Proudhon'.
1 People are very dissatisfied with Eccarius and next Tuesday8 a storm will break that will do him good.
153 The points of the indictment are as follows: He took almost no part at all in the congress and afterwards posed in The Times as the LEADING MIND.
Also in The Times, he took over the proposals of the GENERAL COUNCIL as his private property, and ditto the applause for them as due to him.
He suppressed as far as possible the speeches of the others and, to flatter The Times, falsified Dupont's concluding speech.
Apart from this, Lessner has the GRIEVANCE that when he (Lessner) read from my book, Eccarius suppressed this in The Times,154 ditto that he only included the resolution on the book150 in his correspondence under HIGH PRESSURE, and finally that he falsified the German resolution on war.
155 He said that a European war would be a civil war, instead of saying, as the German resolution stated, THAT A WAR BETWEEN FRANCE AND GERMANY WAS A CIVIL WAR FOR THE PROFIT OF RUSSIA1.
He com­ pletely omits the latter point.
On the other hand, he attributes to the Germans and the English the Belgian nonsense that it was necessary TO STRIKE AGAINST WAR.
On the other hand, as a reporter he has done us some service.
The long and the short of it is that he will be told that he should figure only as reporter in future, with the COUNCIL paying his a of The Daily Telegraph -b K.

But he will never again be named as DELEGATE.
Thus preserved from the CONFLICT OF FRACTIONS.
Lessner says that we accomplished so much despite being so little represented at the congress, which was almost entirely Belgian (with the addition of FRENCHMEN), because on all decisive points the Belgian workers, notwithstanding their Brussels LEADERS, voted with London.
Moses is said to have made the best SPEECH against the Proudhonists.
161 Tolain was so furious that he did not appear at the banquet.
Not only has the Central Council73 here been appointed once again, but the list of members, purified by us, was accepted.
Within four weeks Vesinier is to submit to a commission in Brussels proof of his suspicions regarding Tolain.
156 In case these are baseless (and they are), the congress has already conditionally expelled him from the Association as a slanderer.
The delegate of the FRENCH BRANCH tabled a bill of indictment against the GENERAL COUNCIL which, among other things, contained the modeste demand that the French member of the GENERAL COUNCIL should be named by the FRENCH BRANCH.
In response, the congress simply proceeded with the agenda (exactly as we have treated the GRIEVANCES of these fellows in the GENERAL COUNCIL).
At Nuremberg,135 Liebknecht committed a completely useless stupidity (even one contrary to the Rules) by forcing upon the people Becker's confused wishy-washy stuff as the Programme of the International Working Men's Association.
151 Sonnemann remarked correctly that this was a quid pro quo.
3 But Mr Wilhelm wanted to have democratic babble for the 'People's Party'l 38 Meissner wrote a few lines some weeks ago.

Let us hope that things will now get going.
As regards money matters, I simply cannot go on in this way.
It makes all work impossible.

Apart from this, it is very good, however, that he does not get away with this, and that there are various people WHO WILL WASH HIS HEAD, as Lafargue says.

But we shall have to support him somewhat so that his good will does not weaken.
In puncto* money I shall write to Borkheim willingly as soon as you inform me that he is back.
Apropos this matter, you must, however, let me know what happened when you drew the loan.
For how much did you insure your life, at what premium, and is the policy still valid? Because it might still be possible to get a new loan or an advance on the policy itself from the same society.
But how am I to raise money for you if you leave me quite in the dark about all these matters? If I can reach agreement with Gottfried Ermen, who will scarcely return before the end of October, I shall immediately be able to raise some funds once again, but everything depends on this.
If I can not reach agreement with him, my own position will become very uncertain.
It can, however, take until the end of this year before the matter is settled, and this means another 3 l/2 months.
158 William the Handsomeb is getting exuberant now that his Bismarck has left him.
159 The drive towards war is becoming ever clearer.
For all that, I believe it is now too late for this year.
Purchasing horses and the actual mobilisation still require more time in France than in Prussia, and despite all the preparations and bragging I do not believe that the French need less than 6 weeks for this.
As the domestic supply of horses is insufficient, the beginning of the actual mobilisation, that is to say, now, the firm decision to strike, will inevitably be marked by large purchases of horses abroad, which immediately becomes public knowledge.
Even now it will be a long time before they can have the entire number of horses necessary for war.
Little Louisc will have to give 5-6 weeks NOTICE, and this brings us to the end of October; and especially with the enormous masses now involved, a winter campaign would certainly only be waged in an extreme emergen­ cy.
If there are not quite special reasons, we are pretty safe until March-April, and all sorts of things can happen before then.
In addition, Louis still does not have anything like the number of men he needs.
He will hardly be able to raise more than 650,000 troops of the line (gendarmerie, garde municipale and all sorts of other police troops figure in the army budget), and much of the garde mobile does not even exist on paper.
It takes at least 6/7 years to fully implement a changed military system, and his is only one year old.
I do not believe that Louis wants a war precisely at this moment, if he can avoid it, since every month of delay a As regards -b William I -c Napoleon III 73.

jgi3 Published in English lor the iirst time 73 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER London, 19 September 1868 DEAR FRED, Enclosed a letter from Schweitzer,160 ditto one from Essen and also 6 numbers of the Social-Demokrat.
I must have all this stuff back by Tuesday* What answer should I give the cunning Schweitzer? You will see from the debates of the General Association of German Workers congress104 (in the Social-Demokrat) that the 'true-blue' Lassalleans smelt that their president was leaving Lassalle's course in proposing a congress for the establish­ ment of TRADES UNIONS and settlement of STRIKES.
161 He only received permission to launch this agitation independently of the Associa­ tion of German Workers by threatening to resign.
His purpose, of course, is to get in ahead of Liebknecht, etc.
He was also aware that, with the development of a real workers' organisation in Germany based on TRADES UNIONS, his artificial sectarian Association WOULD SOON BE NOWHERE.
What he now describes in a LEADER (No.
104) b as the summa of Lassalle's discoveries: 'state credit for the foundation of productive associations', is literally copied from the programme of French Catholic socialism, duce c Bûchez, in the Atelier at the time of Louis Philippe.

Dupont is also furious about Eccarius because he took as good as no part in the congress.
153 I shall try to protect Eccarius against 'positive' measures,0 but this time I shall not be able to take sides for him so strongly as I did last year against Fox, Carter, etc.
148 A Bordelaise merchant, friend of Lafargue, English-speaking, passed through here after a journey through Sweden and Denmark.
He told Lafargue that in higher circles there they speak much about my book/ which does not sound very likely to me.
Laurachen is somewhat better.
Her SUFFERINGS are connected with certain natural processes of development.
They want to leave at the beginning of October, and this is awkward because the linen part of the trousseau is still incomplete.
L'illustre Gaudissartf returned today.
The loan was like this: You borrow money FOR A CERTAIN TERM.
If you die before maturity, the sum need not be paid back.
On the other hand, in the contrary case repayment must be made on the date of maturity with the STIPULATED interest.
The transaction is then at an end.
It is thus no life insurance.
You do not receive a policy, but the money, for which you make out a BOND.
This was naturally returned to me.
It is the peculiar form that makes the whole business so expensive — certainly the worst and the dearest way to borrow money.
The sole circumstance which would, in my opinion, favour Bonaparte in a belated campaign is that Russia would then be more paralysed, at least for military action.
One thing is certain.
The whole of France believes that war is IMMINENT.

21 September 1868 is, for this very reason, not in any country in particular, i.

He appoints you Pope so that you may anoint him Kaiser of Germany, and thus give a kick to Wilhelm.
" In any case, it is worth much that you have this letter in your hands.
I think you should, above all, point out to the philistine that his workers' congress164 only makes sense if it is a genuine workers' congress, not merely a feeble imitation of his Hamburg congress; i.
e.
if Schweitzer sees to it that non-Lassallean elements are also represented.
So far, there is no sign of this, and Schweitzer does not appear to have taken any steps in this direction.
Whether he 'can make friends' with Wilhelm and others or not, is completely immaterial; in a matter like this he must go along with them.
Then, regarding the statutes, you could write to him that what counts is less what is in them than how they are handled.
The fellow obviously wishes to push out Wilhelmchen, Bebel and consorts, and be able to appeal to something in writing from you for this purpose.
That must be very important to him, otherwise he would never have written you this letter, which delivers him absolutely into your hands for ever.
You are quite right that he sees that a few Lassallean phrases will no longer do and that he must expand.
If I am not mistaken you also gave Wilhelmchen copies of the 18th Brumaire.

166 I have replied to Wilhelm 84: No overhastiness! If he acts with tact, Schweitzer will himself SETTLE DOWN TO MORE MODERATE 'PROPORTIONS' or ruin himself.
The dissolution of the General Association of German Workers 167 brings Lassalleanism qua3 such to a forcible end, although it still may carry on for SOME TIME A LINGERING SECT LIFE.
I enclose Schweitzer's report in the Social-Demokrat on the catastrophe.
11 I completely share your view that the Spanish revolution (it has the same significance as the Neapolitan revolution of 1848168 ) gives a new turn to European history and, in particular, like a deus ex machina, cuts the Gordian knot of the repulsive German-French war.

24 September 1868 76 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 24 September 1868 Dear Moor, So that is the reason for the sycophantic letter from Schweitzer! a The fellow obviously knew what was in store for him when he wrote to you.
On the one hand, it may not be altogether unwelcome to him that he can drop the strict Lassallean religion, but fundamentally the loss of the 'tight' organisation and of the possibility to play at dictator is certainly fatal to him.
Of course, this is the end of the Lassallean sect's self-important pretence that it is 'the party' in Germany, and the sect will gradually expire; it will continue to twitch the longest in the Bergisches Land, the real home of sects.
Incidentally, as Wilhelm b rightly guesses, his associations will also come under attack.
169 So much the better.
The petty-bourgeois-people's-party-federalist fad of these fellows is not worth a penny.
And it is a good thing that the government really stirs up the workers, once it sees that the workers won't let themselves be used by it against the bourgeoisie.
Some form or another will surely be found.
But what a comrade Wilhelm is! Less than 4 months since he entered into a 'sort of alliance' with Schweitzer, 105 and today they are again at loggerheads, and he is too SLIPPERY for him.
He knew that before, didn't he—but what about the fine lads he had 'assigned to watch him'! What is this proclamation that you are supposed to issue by all means?166 And these fine phrases in it about 'persons' which Wilhelm might construe against Baptist 0 and Baptist against Wilhelm! The South German democrat is impossible to get rid of, once you have him in your system.

25 September 1868 78 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER London, 25 September 1868 DEAR FRED, BY ALL MEANS do the stuff for Liebknecht 170 as quickly as feasible.
Otherwise, the fellow will do it himself and, you may depend upon it, do it badly.
It appears to me it would be a good thing if you were also to draw attention to what Bernhard Becker stole from your pamphlet 3 and endorsed, after bitter experience, in his shitty pamphlet.
b (He cursed us so horribly when he was still 'President of Humanity'.
171) You can have the pamphlet right away if you write immediately to Strohn, who took it with him to Bradford.
The time has now come to KICK this 'Lassalleanism' 'just for a start'.
And there is no need at all to allow B.
Becker's shitty pamphlet to be buried in silence.
172 The 'appeal' the fiery Wilhelmchen speaks of 166 is this: I (i.
e.
in the name of the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as its SECRETARY FOR GERMANY) must naturally address SOME GENERAL LINES to the German workers, now that their relationship to us has changed as a result of their various congress decisions.
But no undue haste is necessary in so doing.
In all these things 'more haste, less speed', and, as we know, our Wilhelmchen has shown no 'haste' with the matter for 6-7 years.
Quant àc Schweitzer, I had a sort of presentiment that some turning point WAS LOOMING SOMEWHERE.
Although my reply to him had therefore been ready for some days d—(in which I with school­ masterly reserve point out to him, in particular, the difference in conditions between a sectarian movement and a real class movement)—I have, nevertheless, held the stuff back.
And I will now only answer him after the results are available of his fresh attempt to call a congress in Berlin for forming TRADES UNIONS.
164 In any case, Schweitzer has learned one thing about me, that the promptness with which I answer his letters is always in inverse proportion to their 'warmth of feeling'.

These lousy little SHOPKEEPERS are a wretched class.
My wife immediately took the money to the house of the dun.
The man himself had 'made himself scarce' for the time being (and he is in his way quite a decent fellow); his wife, dripping with tears, accepted the money for him.
Many, in fact most, of these SHOPKEEPERS experience all the misery of the proletariat, plus the 'fear' and 'serfdom of respectability', and without the COMPENSATING self-esteem of the better workers.
Apropos.
The squabble among the authorities of the TRADES UNIONS, which in fact paralysed them for years, has at last been settled.
THE LONDON TRADES' COUNCIL (Odger et Co.
), London WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATION (Potter et Co.
) and the AMALGAMATED TRADES UNIONS (I believe the main office is at present Sheffield, it changes annually) have finally agreed on joint action.

115 WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATION' that moved the Prussian government to this decisive blow.
As for the 'warm fraternal' letter from Schweitzer to me, 160 this is explained simply by his fear that following the Nuremberg decision 136 I might now publicly speak up for Wilhelm a and against him.
Such a polemic would certainly be awkward after the Hamburg affair (le bonhomme* had written to me requesting me kindly to come to Hamburg in person, 'to have the well-earned laurels placed upon my brow'!).
The most essential thing for the German working class is that it should cease to agitate by permission of the high government authorities.
Such a bureaucratically schooled RACE must undergo a complete course of 'self help'.
On the other hand, they undoubt­ edly have the advantage that they are starting the movement at a period when conditions are much further developed than they were for the English and that, as Germans, they have heads on their shoulders capable of generalising.
Eccarius is full of praise for the parliamentary propriety and tact that reigned at the Nuremberg congress, particularly compared with the French at Brussels.
138 In Spain things still look doubtful; but it appears to me that the movement can be suppressed only for a short time at the most.
165 One thing I do not understand is that the LEADERS did not wait until the 'Innocent Lady'c had left Spain and was visiting Bonaparte.

One of Schweitzer's most ridiculous operations—to which, however, he is absolutely forced by the prejudices of his army and as the president of the General Association of German Workers— is that he regularly pledges himself in verba magistri,d and each time he makes a new concession to the needs of the real workers' movement he argues timidly that this does not contradict the dogmas of the Lassallean faith, the only guarantee of eternal salvation.

You will see from them that 'boozy' Schulze-Delitzsch has succeeded in giving momentary importance to Schweitzer's stage-trick; that Schweitzer's whole congress consists only (minus 12 men) of Lassalleans 177; and that Schweitzer believes that he can in a very simple way replace his dictatorship over the General Association of German Workers by the dictatorship over the German working class.
That is very naive.
The sole practical question for us is: Should I or should I not issue an appeal at this moment? In view of its position, the General Council must maintain an impartial stand.
Would it not therefore be better to wait until 1.
the nullity of the results of Schweitzer's game has become more apparent and, 2.
Liebknecht and Co.
have really organised something? It appears to me that the power of the General Council greatly depends upon its not tying itself down prematurely and never doing so without certainty of success; it should, rather, practise Russian diplomacy in its operations.

As far as I know, the Lassalleans accepted your programme in Hamburg, 104 so more cannot be expected.
One must simply leave it to Schweitzer to destroy himself; if we ourselves were in Germany, things would be different.
Even from the previous Social-Demokrat I saw that he wanted to transfer his 'tight organisation' to the TRADES UNIONS0; now we have to wait and see whether he succeeds, which I do not believe.

This is precisely how it acted at the time with regard to the Parisians.
178 Moreover, what is Wilhelmchen's organisation169 so far, what has been the effect of the Nuremberg decision? 135 Have societies really affiliated, paid subscriptions, etc.
? I know nothing about it.
And what does Wilhelm want to do in relation to Schweitzer's STRIKE organisation? 164 What else does he want to organise? All this is still very unclear to me.
Furthermore: What practical effect would it have if you and the General Council issued a declaration against the Lassalleans? I believe very little, at most the sect as such would stick together the more firmly.
And what can they be reproached with? That they do not follow W.
Liebknecht? As long as the fellows have trust in Schweitzer, and as long as Liebknecht and Schweitzer squabble, all sermonising about unity is sheer folly.
To attack the Lassalle stuff in literary form is quite another matter.
But to proscribe him, so to speak, would only consolidate a sect which is otherwise in disintegration.

Vogt.
9 I could not write to you about this since Schorlemmer was in the LAKES, and I myself naturally asked no questions.
So far, I only heard yesterday that the lecture did not cover the expenses, that Vogt, though he has always given the same lecture for the past year, nevertheless spoke very stumblingly and sloppily, often repeated himself, etc.
After the lecture some people sat with him in the dining room, where the good Vogt was, however, so pressed with questions about the monkey trial by the Unitarian preacher Steinthal (brother of Weerth's 3), by Kalisch, an old boring language teacher, and by yet another fellow, that he was absolutely overwhelmed and sneaked off at the first opportunity.
He is said to have felt altogether very uneasy and uncomfortable here, while in Bradford he was very feted and buoyant.
He made a few remarks to Davisson which caused the latter to note afterwards that he must be quite a nasty fellow, capable of anything.
I shall be hearing more.
In any case, he will not come here again.

At the end of last month the sum of £72 was due for wine which Charles, b Gumpert and I had received from him.
It was only at the beginning of this month, however, that I could lay my hands on the cash.
So I sent it to him yesterday and asked whether he knew how to raise £100 for you or whether he could leave the wine unpaid until February.
He agreed to the latter and advanced the other £28 himself.
So we have, I think, peace and quiet at least for the immediate future.
But now you must get on with the 2nd volume,41 and give your liver some exercise.
The Spanish business 165 has gone brilliantly so far.

Read through the manuscript.
My view is that J.
Dietzgen would do best if he condensed all his ideas into 2 printed sheets and had them printed in his name as a tanner.
If he publishes them at the intended length, he will make a fool of himself because of the lack of dialectical development and the running in circles.
Read it through and write your opinion.

To understand Gaudissart'sb letter, briefly the following: He wanted to write about the Pan-Slav democratic movement; for this I gave him your articles about Bakunin in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung? His plan to appear with you before the public is excellent, but there is no hurry because he has not turned out his 25 printed sheets by a long way yet.
Secondly, he maintained a certain correspondence, despite my warning, with Dr Crapper, alias Elard Biscamp.
Now that the latter has directly attacked me and the International in the Weser-Zeitung and the Augsburgerin, d he proposes, as you see, to publish in Liebknecht's paper his latest exchange of letters with Biscamp.
Ce brave" Gaudissart! In these letters he presents himself as my patron, and lets Biscamp flatter him.
I wrote to him by return that I would have to protest tooth and nail against this sort of thing.
84 For greater security I immediately wrote to Liebknecht that he must not print the Borkheim-Biscamp correspondence under any circumstances.
8* Ad 1 and 2.
I have sent to Liebknecht for his political review an entrefilet about M.
Hirsch (because of the 'International'), and, at the same time, a few blows at Biscamp as correspondent of the Weser-Zeitung and the Augsburger? Ad 6.
The £100 (of which ABOUT £35 for Laura) I have used to pay off the most urgent things and only kept as much on hand as is necessary in order not to be absolutely penniless.

Dear Sir, In reply to your esteemed letter, 186 the following: 1.
You must not wait for the second volume, the publication of which will be delayed by perhaps another 6 months.
187 I cannot finish it, until certain official enquêtes," instituted during last year (and 1866) in France, the UNITED STATES and England, have been completed or published.
In any case, Volume I constitutes a whole, complete in itself.

3.
Socialist literature does not exist in the UNITED STATES.
There are only workers' papers.
4.
I myself possess no collection of my works, which were written in various languages and published in various places.
Most of them are out of print.
Since I am unable to meet your request in this respect— la plus belle fille de France ne peut donner que ce qu'elle ah—I shall have to confine myself to giving you some brief notes on my literary-political activity, which you might be able to use in the preface to your translation.

b Schweitzer is a special case.
The fellow is more cunning and more active than all his opponents together, although this time he has certainly been too cunning—according to the Kölnische Zeitung the real workers' assemblies which are now appearing are everywhere repudiating the presidents imposed upon them by the 'Congress', 164 and these SELF-ELECTED fellows, up to and including Schweitzer, will realise that, as soon as there is real BUSINESS, these tricks and attempts to impose their sect upon the real movement as a leadership are no longer effective.
As Secretary for Germany you will of course have to correspond with the UNIONS that might be formed, as long as counter-uNioNS are not formed within the individual trades, when a choice would have to be made between the two—or could they both affiliate? In this respect, you will have English PRECEDENTS.

126 the point that Schweitzer and his people should always be reminded that they are corresponding with the Secretary for Germany, not with Karl Marx, and you will see to this.
The Russian translation a is very gratifying; as soon as the matter has gone a little further, this should be got into the press.
I have not yet been able to look at the manuscript by Dietzgen.
185 Gaudissartb becomes increasingly amusing.
The 30 printed sheets are not dangerous for the time being; since they are supposed to appear simultaneously in 4 languages it will probably still take an eternity.
As a Jew he simply cannot stop cheating, and it serves him right that he has burnt his fingers on Biscamp.
Wilhelmchenc is not bad either.
Regarding the Swabians, it thus appears to be money matters that bind him and his people to the federalists.
This should be investigated more closely, afterwards all this will fall on our shoulders.
I had drawn his attention to the fact that at a moment when revolutionary action came nearer, it was absolutely against the interests of our Party that our people should be too closely committed to one party in the basically rotten antagonism between Greater Prussia and Austrian-Federalist Greater Germany.
The unfortunate fool still cannot see that the entire antithesis with its two sides is a case of narrow-mindedness pure and simple.
I thought the Spanish revolution ,65 would have made him see some light, but NO GO.
I have seen no details yet about the course of the Schweitzer congress and its effects, since I only receive the Zukunft late.
Best greetings.

10 October 1868 127 88 MARX TO ENGELS 174 IN MANCHESTER London, 10 October 1868 DEAR FRED, THANKS FOR THE £5.
I have given Lessner £8.
a There is, incidentally, a fairly important mistake in his bill which he had, however, corrected before the intervention of my wife.
Enclosed letter from Schweitzer192 together with a number of the Social-Demokrat which he sent me in the letter.
You must return the letter to me by Tuesday,b together with your ADVICE.
We cannot TEMPORISE any longer.
So that you knew exactly how matters stand, the following: For the time being, I have written to Liebknecht 84 that I COULD TAKE NO ACTION, that Schweitzer had hitherto given no official occasion, that an intervention on my part could only consolidate Lassalleanism, etc.
As TO Schweitzer, I have not yet answered his previous letter,160 the dispatch of which he is probably now cursing.
Since his TRADES UNIONS CONGRESS164 was so near, I thought it better to await 'the course of events', and TO WATCH HIS OPERATIONS.
NOW I must, of course, break my silence.
As regards the letter from Schweitzer, it is clear that he does not feel quite happy in his boots.
His threat of 'open war' is silly, though the phrase is 'OSTENSIBLY' only aimed against Liebknecht et Co.
His claim that Mr Nobody started it, is in no way correct.
His alleged identification with the International Working Men's Association stands in a certain contradiction to his HINTS in the Social-Demokrat after the Nuremberg affair that his association had 'not' joined the IWA.
Above all it emerges from the whole letter that Schweitzer still cannot drop his fixed idea that he has 'his own workers' movement'.
On the other hand, he is unquestionably the most intelligent and most energetic of all the present workers' leaders in Germany, while Liebknecht IN POINT OF FACT was only forced by Schweitzer to recall that there existed a workers' movement independent of the petty-bourgeois democratic move­ ment.
My plan is not to use diplomacy but to tell Schweitzer the unvarnished truth about my view of his dealings, and make it clear a See this volume, p.
122.
-b 13 October 128 88.
Marx to Engels.
10 October 1868 to him that he must choose between the 'sect' and the 'class'.
If he wishes to come to a rational understanding with the 'Nuremberg majority',135 I am ready as 'Secretary for Germany' to be of aid on TERMS which appear reasonable to me.
If he does not desire this, I can only promise to maintain the necessary objective impartiality vis-à-vis his agitation.
What I cannot promise, however, is that I will not, in my private capacity, publicly attack the Lassallean superstition as soon as I regard this as useful.
3 Pretty and truly Lassallean is Schweitzer's notion that 'two organisations can only be harmful' and hence, since he preceded the others, they are, if not legally, then in a way morally, obliged to 'dissolve' themselves in him.
As you know, Mr Odger is standing for Chelsea, but I believe he has no chance of success.
Odger has shown us the COLD SHOULDER for the whole of last year since, on my proposal, 'the president of the IWA' and thus also 'President' Odger were abolished once and for all.
193 Now he gives thanks for his re-election by the Brussels Congress and wishes us to support his election with a letter to his ELECTIONEERING COMMITTEE.
We are only meeting his request because it is a step that is useful to the International and that recommends it in the eyes of the London WORKMEN.
194 When you were here last,129 you saw the Blue Book173 on the Irish land question 1844-1845.
BY ACCIDENT I found the REPORT and EVIDENCE on IRISH TENANT RIGHT 1867 (HOUSE OF LORDS) in a small second-hand booksHOP.
This was a real find.
The economist gentlemen regard it purely as a question of conflicting dogmas whether rent is payment for natural differences in land, or on the other hand merely interest on the capital invested in the land; but here we have a real life and death struggle between FARMER and LANDLORD as to how far rent should include, apart from the payment for land differences, also the interest on the capital invested in the land not by the LANDLORD but by the tenant.
Political economy can only be turned into a positive science by replacing the CONFLICTING DOGMAS by the CONFLICTING FACTS, and by the real antagonisms which form their concealed background.

3 I completely share your view on the therapy in this case.
But he will scarcely be ready to part with 'his own workers' movement'.
His ambitions exceed his strength, or, as the Italians put it, vuol petare piu alto del culo,b and on this inner contradiction he will work himself to death.
In my view, the statutes0 are absurd for this purpose, but it is immaterial in the end.
And please do not omit the final sentence about the attack on the Lassallean superstition; this will be effective with the fellow, who is well aware that the whole stuff is HUMBUG.
I was unable to write to you while I was in town, and now it is nearly 8 o'clock, when the post closes out here, so I cannot add anything.

12 October 1868 90 MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 29 IN HANOVER London, 12 October 1868 1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park My dear Friend, Your obstinate silence is quite incomprehensible to me.
Did I perhaps give cause for it in my last letter?a I hope not.
In any case—unintentional.
I need not explain to you explicitly, you know that you are my most intimate friend in Germany, and I really cannot understand how, inter amicos,h people can keep such a sharp lookout, all because of some trifle.
Least of all have you such a right with regard to me, for you know how much I owe you.
Apart from everything personal, you have done more for my bookc than all Germany put together.
'95 Yet perhaps you are so energetically silent in order to prove to me that you are not like that set of so-called friends, who are silent when things go badly, and speak when they go well.
But there is no need for such a demonstration on your part.
By speaking about the 'good state of affairs' I mean, first, the propaganda made by my book and the recognition it has received from the German workers SINCE YOU WROTE ME LAST.
Second, however, the wonderful progress made by the International Working Men's Association, particularly in England, too.
A few days ago a Petersburg publisher11 surprised me with the news that a Russian translation of Capital is now at the printers.
196 He asked for my photogram as a vignette for the title page, and I could not deny this trifle to 'my good friends' the Russians.
It is an irony of fate that the Russians, against whom I have been fighting incessantly for 25 years, not only in German, but also in French and English, have always been my 'patrons'.
In 1843-1844 in Paris, the Russian aristocrats there waited on me hand and foot.
197 My book against Proudhon (1847), ditto that published by Duncker (1859),e have nowhere had such good sales as in Russia.
And the first foreign nation to translate Capital is Russia.
Yet not too much should be made of all this.
The Russian aristocracy are educated, in their youth, at German universities and in Paris.

I am having plenty of 'BOTHER' JUST NOW in Germany with the leaders' squabbles, as you will see from the enclosed letters, which you will please return.
On one side Schweitzer, who is appointing me Pope in partibus infidelium,b so that I can proclaim him the workers' emperor in Germany.
On the other side Liebknecht, who forgets that it was, IN POINT OF FACT, Schweitzer who forced him to recall that there is a movement of the proletariat that is different from the petty-bourgeois democratic movement.
I hope you and your family are well.

Marx to Schweitzer.
13 October 1868 91 MARX TO JOHANN BAPTIST VON SCHWEITZER 199 IN BERLIN [Draft] To von Schweitzer London, 13 October 1868 Dear Sir, A misunderstanding on my part accounts for your having received no reply to your letter of 15 September.
I interpreted the letter as meaning that you would submit your 'proposals' to me for examination.
160 So I waited for them.
Then came your congress,164 and (BEING MUCH OVERWORKED) I regarded a reply as no longer urgent.
Before the arrival of your letter dated 8 October, I had already repeatedly appealed for peace, in my capacity as secretary of the International for Germany.
I received the answer (and with it relevant quotations from the Social-Demokrat) that you yourself were provoking war.
I declared that my role must necessarily be confined to that of 'impartial referee' at a duel.
3 In your letters you express great trust in me, and I believe I cannot respond better than to give you my opinion of the present state of affairs quite openly, without any diplomatic circumlocu­ tion.
In doing so, I assume that, for you, as for myself, the cause is all that matters.
I recognise, without reserve, the intelligence and energy with which you are active in the workers' movement.
I have concealed this view from none of my friends.
Wherever I have to express my views in public—in the General Council of the International Working Men's Association and in the German Communist Association hereb—I have always treated you as a man of our party, and never let drop a word about points of difference.
However, such points of difference do exist.
D'abord,c as regards the Lassallean Association,104 it was formed in a period of reaction.
After fifteen years of slumber, Lassalle — and this remains his immortal service—re-awakened the workers' movement in Germany.
But he made great mistakes.
He allowed himself to be influenced too much by the immediate circumstances a See this volume, p.
127.
-b the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 67) -c First 91.
Marx to Schweitzer.
13 October 1868 133 of the time.
He made the minor starting point, his opposition to the dwarf-like Schulze-Delitzsch, the central point of his agita­ tion—state aid versus self-help.
200 In this, he merely re-adopted the slogan circulated in 1843 sqq.
by Bûchez, the leader of Catholic socialism, against the genuine workers' movement in France.
162 Being far too intelligent to regard this slogan as anything but a transitory pis-aller,* Lassalle was only able to justify its use on the grounds of its immediate (alleged!) PRACTICABILITY.
TO this end, he had to claim that it was feasible in the immediate future.
The 'state' was, therefore, transformed into the Prussian state.
He was thus forced to make concessions to the Prussian monarchy, to Prussian reaction (the feudal party) and even to the clericals.
He linked Buchez's state aid for associations with the Chartist call for universal suffrage.
201 He overlooked the difference between conditions in Germany and England.
He overlooked the lessons of the bas-empire,h with regard to universal suffrage in France.
In addition, like everyone who claims to have in his pocket a panacea for the sufferings of the masses, he gave his agitation, from the very start, a religious, sectarian character.
In fact, every sect is religious.
And just because he was the founder of a sect, he denied all natural connection with the earlier movement, both in Germany and abroad.
He fell into Proudhon's mistake of not seeking the real basis of his agitation in the actual elements of the class movement, but of wishing, instead, to prescribe for that movement a course determined by a certain doctrinaire recipe.
Most of what I am stating here post factum I predicted to Lassalle when he came to London in 1862 and called upon me to place myself, with him, at the head of the new movement.
You yourself know the difference between a sect movement and a class movement from personal experience.
The sect seeks its raison d'être and its point d'honneur not in what it has in common with the class movement, but in the particular shibboleth distinguish­ ing it from that movement.
Thus when, in Hamburg, you proposed convening a congress to found TRADES UNIONS, 164 you could only suppress the opposition of the sectarians by threatening to resign as president.
You were also forced to assume a dual personality, to state that, in one case, you were acting as the leader of the sect and, in the other, as the representative of the class movement.

Marx to Schweitzer.
13 October 1868 ers 167 provided you with an opportunity to take a big step forward and to declare, to prove s'il le fallait, 3 that a new stage of development had been reached and the sect movement was now ripe to merge into the class movement and end all 'eanisms'.
With regard to the true content of the sect, it would, like all former workers' sects, carry this as an enriching element into the general movement.
Yet instead you, in fact, demanded that the class movement subordinate itself to a particular sect movement.
Your non-friends concluded from this that you wished to conserve your 'own workers' movement' under all circumstances.
Regarding the Berlin Congress,164 the time was d'abord not pressing, since the Combination Law has not yet been voted.
202 You ought, therefore, to have reached an agreement with the leaders outside the Lassallean circle, worked out the plan together with them, and convoked the congress.
Instead of this, you left them only the alternative of either publicly joining you, or lining up against you.
The congress itself appeared to be only an extended edition of the Hamburg Congress.
104 As for the draft statutes,b I regard them as unsuitable in principle, and I believe I have as much experience as any of my contemporaries in the field of TRADES UNIONS.
Without going further into detail here, I shall merely remark that a centralist organisa­ tion, suitable as it is for secret societies and sect movements, contradicts the nature of the TRADE UNIONS.
Were it possible—I declare it tout bonnement" to be impossible—it would not be desirable, least of all in Germany.
Here, where the worker is regulated bureaucratically from childhood onwards, where he believes in authority, in those set over him, the main thing is to teach him to walk by himself.
Your plan is also impracticable in other ways.
In the 'Union' there are to be three independent authorities of differing origin: 1.
The Committee, elected by the trades; 2.
the President (here a completely superfluous personage) {in the Rules of the Interna­ tional Working Men's Association there also figures a President of the Association.
d In reality his only function was to preside at the sessions of the General Council.
On my proposal, this office— which I had refused in 1866—was completely abolished in 1867, and was replaced by that of a CHAIRMAN, who is elected at each a if necessary -b 'Satzung für den Arbeiterschaftsverband', Der Social-Demokrat, No.

And now this in a TRADES UNIONS movement! The latter is mostly concerned with financial issues, and you will soon discover that all dictatorialism finds its end here.
Yet whatever the shortcomings of the organisation, they can perhaps be cancelled out, to a greater or lesser degree, by rational application.

14 October 1868 92 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 14 October 1868 Dear Moor, Today the Kölnische Zeitung states that the workers (COLLIERS) in Essen, who have just ended the STRIKE successfully, 203 have revolted against Schweitzerism and its supporters, the local bigwigs, and are demanding strict accounting of the STRIKE funds.
11 The source is suspect, but the symptom is significant.
This whole agitation breaks down on money matters; the Lassallean leaders are too scoundrelly in this respect.
Further, it reports that in Gladbach the cotton manufacturers have recognised that the working day is too long, and are forming an association among themselves to reduce the day from 13 hours to 12 for the time being (issue of 12 October).
You see that your book b is also having a practical effect on the bourgeoisie.
Yet another stupid issue of Wilhelm's sheetc this week! He interrupts your stuff about Hirsch d in order to publish a rubbishy article which amounts to saying that bourgeois society, or 'the social', as he puts it, is determined by 'the political' and not vice versa.
e Naturam si furca expellas,1 etc.
Nearly every article is crawling with nonsense.
Ernest the Fox now seems to be a certainty here if you can trust the cheers with which he, in particular, is honoured everywhere among the 3 liberal candidates.
102 If things go well, this will be due neither to his cunning, nor to his STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS, but only to the instinct of the masses.
The Tories can find no candidate, it is said they wish to put up here one of the Hoares (London bankers); but the man will have to have a lot of money to throw away for nothing if he lets himself in for it.

15 October 1868 137 In Berlin, as a result of the great heat last summer, afternoon lessons were completely abandoned in a number of high schools and morning lessons extended by one period.
The results were quite unexpected, the boys made enormously rapid progress, and the business is now going to be tried out on a larger scale.
In Spain the rule of the generals appears to be wearing out rapidly.
165 The abolition of the Jesuits and the partial abolition of the monasteries had been long in coming and only seem to have been forced, at least in part, by financial difficulties; on the other hand, the reward for the officers and NCOs for joining the insurrectionary side came quickly enough.
The disarmament of the people also appears to be only a question of time.
All the same, in a movement like this the little tricks are not enough with which, after a coup, a general could edge his way through as Isabella's minister.

1* 95 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 22 October 1868 Dear Moor, The little Russian Ermen,a whose fate you can see from the enclosed paper, has, on the pretext that he must now settle down, been living in our office for a week now, and has only emerged rather drunk to visit his betrothed.
Since the whole office was turned into a pub, no sort of work could be done, and that is why I have only now got around to writing to you.
I have not yet been able to read the Congress 164 reports in the Social-Demokrat, which are also very boring.
b Apart from this, Schweitzer shows that he is very serious about his sect.
Not only has the General Association of German Workers been reformed, with its headquarters in Berlin 167 and with new statutes/ the only alterations having been made, compared to the old statutes, with an eye to the Law on Association,206 but every detail shows that in the new TRADES UNIONS GAGW aims to play (but openly) the same role as our old secret league '18 did in the legal associations.
The TRADES UNIONS are only to form an exoteric party of the Lassallean church of sole salvation, but only the latter remains the one of sole salvation.
If Eichhoff forms a separate association in Berlin, 207 he is promised gracious toleration on the condition that his associa­ tion takes a 'friendly' attitude towards GAGW.
But Schweitzer and his Association remain "the party", and the others may come and join it; or else remain heretics and DISSENTERS.
Apart from this, the fellow has a much clearer grasp than all the others of the general political situation and a much clearer attitude to the other parties; and he is cleverer in his presentation than all the others.
He calls 'all old parties facing us, one single reactionary mass, and their differences are scarcely of any significance for us'.
He recognises that 1866 and its results are ruining the system of petty principalities, undermining the principle of legitimacy, shaking reaction, and have set the people in motion, but he has—now—also come out against the other results, the burden of a Anton Ermen -b Der Social-Demokrat, Nos.

, and his attitude to Bismarck is more 'correct', as the Berliners say, than e.
g.
Liebknecht's is, with regard to the ex-princes.
You will have seen that he cites the Elector of Hesse 3 as a historical authority—on the all-too-familiar subjects—and in his last number he allows a true Hanoverian to strike up a Guelphic whimpering.
b On this last point, couldn't you for once tell Wilhelm what is what? It is really asking a lot to expect us to support a paper in which he allows such dirty tricks.
Have at least a part of the anti-Proudhonsc sent to London; these few remaining copies cannot be replaced.
I myself have none.
Vieweg should be asked to account for the copies sold since 1865.
It is, in addition, certainly a good thing that you are following the matter up, even though only now.
There is always the possibility that something may still come out of it.
The business with the Westminsterd is very good.
Do not allow time to slip by; the article should appear in the January issue; so send me the stuff as soon as possible, so I may do my part.
It is very good that these fellows would not use a simple presentation of a new scientific development without the phraseology of their 'ESSAYS', which make the matter not only less clear, but also drier.
I would, however, also ask Mr Beesly how many printed sheets would be available.
The stuff I sent you would have made 1 sheet in the Fortnightly, but about 1 V2 in the Westminster.
According to space—and since only one article is possible here—we should consider whether and which parts of the book should be left out completely—for instance I do not believe it will be possible to include the chapter on accumulation208 without cutting down the space for the main subject too much.

Letter from Liebknecht.
The brute seems quite mad.
Weeks ago he wrote to me saying he would let me have COPIES OF Vogt.
And, as always with Liebknecht, there the matter rests.
Not another word about it.
A mass of stupid suggestions instead.
I,he says, should reply to Faucher, b since Liebknecht cannot answer him, and Faucher has ADMIRERS in several Leipzig tap-rooms.
He will refrain 'for the present', and against his will, from attacks on Schweitzer.
As if he had not, on the other hand, asked me, in his honour, kindly to attack Schweitzer 'for the present'.
I am to place at his disposal a 'selection of choice passages' from Miquel's private correspondence with me, since he fancies that Miquel is 'dangerous'.
I am to send him Freiligrath's poem against Kinkel, c so he can rehabilitate Freiligrath at Kinkel's expense.
Finally, I am to make a certain Stromeyer—(he means Strohn)—in Bradford the agent for Ernst Stehfest et Co.
, Crimmitschau (spinning and weaving partnership).
WHAT ELSE? Luckily this time he has not done me the honour of asking me to purchase here, in the City, ENGLISH MUSTARD SPECIMENS for an alleged consumer society in Leipzig, and to establish a 'connection' with the firm.
The UPSHOT of the whole business was—IN RETURN for the MUSTARD and the business information — the sentence: The MUSTARD is excellent! This is in fact what the English economists call 'CONSUMPTIVE DEMAND' par excellence.
Borkheim's Russophobia (with which I inoculated him as the mildest sickness for the diversion of his superfluous vital spirits) is assuming dangerous dimensions; he now has a row with OLD Philipp Becker, since the latter is on good terms with Bakunin and has written to Borkheim that he should not attack Bakunin in his letters.
Borkheim regards this as a dangerous Muscovite conspira­ cy.
He believes that his 'masterly invectives' in Wilhelm's Wochen­ blatt are causing Byzantium—and therefore also Bakunin—to a for the future -b See this volume, pp.

In a stern letter to Becker, he has declared with his usual delicacy that he will maintain his friendship for him and his (BY THE BY negligible) pecuniary support, but—politics should now be excluded from their correspondence! The 12 RAGAMUFFINS of the so-called FRENCH BRANCH held a PUBLIC MEETING in London last Tuesday, again under Pyat's chairman­ ship 210 and with the reading of one of his melodramatic PUFFS for the revolution.
There were big placards on the walls AS FOLLOWS: République Française La Branche française de l'Association Internationale, etc.
, etc.
Then Félix Pyat in huge letters.
The points for discussion, listed in French, included: 3.
Vote d'adhésion au manifeste a (the manifesto of the Commune de Paris, which exists only on the moon, which was to be read by Pyat and had been fabricated by him) et protestation, contre l'indifférence en matière politique professée à Bruxelles au dernier Congrès de l'Association Internationale}' 136 Under this, however, was the English notice (also distributed as a HANDBILL): DEMOCRATS OF ALL NATIONS ARE INVITED, etc.
'FOR THE PURPOSE OF DECIDING WHETHER THE WORKINGMEN'S INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION IS TO BE A POLITICAL ASSOCIATION.
' Last Tuesday0 I was empowered to disavow the fellows immediately and publicly if the London daily newspapers should treat or mention this as a demonstration of ours.
Luckily, NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM.
This evening there is, however, to be a SUBCOMMITTEE at which witnesses are to be heard that one of this dozen was formerly a marchand d'hommes d and a brothel keeper,6 another a gambler, a third a SPY for the MASTERS in the TAILORS'STRIKE here,211 etc.

On the basis of the 'morals paragraph' of the Rules, these gentlemen will probably be kicked out.

Kertbény's address: No.
ll/III (what the III means I don't know, perhaps the floor) Behrenstrasse.
Now, permit me a word.
Since you and Engels were of the opinion that it would be useful, I gave in on the question of the advertisement in the Gartenlaube.
3 My conviction was decisively against it.
And now I request you urgently finally to abandon this joke.
The only result is that fellows like Keil and the Daheim sort believe one to belong to the tribe of great men, literary or other, and to need or seek their protection.
I believe this sort of thing is harmful rather than helpful and beneath the dignity of a man of science.
For instance, Meyer's Konversationslexikon wrote a long time ago asking me for a biography.
Not only did I not send one; I did not even reply to the letter.
Everybody must work out his own salvation.
As for Kertbény, he is a pompous, confused, importunate literary idler, and the less one has to do with him the better.

Meyer's appointment was printed in The Bee-Hive* on 3 October.
1 " The GENERAL COUNCIL has resolved that the German correspondents shall correspond with me, Pelletier (for the French) with Dupont, and Eccarius with Jessup.
I myself suggested the latter, as I have no time for more correspondence.
You can hand the enclosed lines to Jessup c and, at the same time, show him your credentials.
With regard to Eccarius there is some misunderstanding.
I have never quarrelled with him; on the contrary I have supported him to this day against the ATTACKS by the English, etc.
148 But he—his preponderant and often narrow-minded egoism perhaps de­ veloped as a result of his circumstances—commits unpleasant tomfooleries from time to time.

3 But it is quite possible that Eccarius wrote to Liebknecht without my knowledge in such a way that moved the latter to make his remarks to Vogt.
This would be peculiar, since just at that time I had a big dispute with the English about and for Eccarius.
As far as Sorgeh is concerned, no further action.
My lines to Jessup explain the TEMPORARY character of the credentials.
Cards for members are no longer available, must be reprinted.
Liebknecht is dabbling too much in south German patriotism, and he should not print such nonsense about 'state and society' c containing the exact opposite of our opinions.

NOTHING OF THE SORT.
His denouncer (which he should not know) is Borkheim.
In order to get rid of him ON THIS POINT and, at the same time, to elucidate the suspicion that could, in fact, be aroused by Eichhoff's reference to Bismarck (in his speech reported in Wilhelm's Wochenblatt), I have written to Eichhoff 84 that he has been denounced to the General Council here and should send me his DEFENCE.

Weber between bourgeois and worker—the bourgeois must, however, realise that he has to concede this and that to the worker—anything to avoid a June battle, for this is followed by 2 December.
2 7 It is really the crowning point of all confusion.
If now the bourgeois will not 'understand', the worker will have to realise that he will have to make concessions to the bourgeois.
This is the sole possible sense which the thing can have.
Hence, the ridiculousness of measuring Spanish conditions, with the enormous beggar-proletariat, both clerical and lay, against the yardstick of conditions in Saxony.
There is naturally not a single mention of the peasants.

Moore tells me that nearly all factory workers in Vienna are Moravians and Bohemians, mainly Czechs.
This explains much about the movement there.
The real Viennese do not go into factories, they become coachmen, domestics or something like that.

185 The latter I had placed in a safe place, away from the tidying females, and there it was completely forgotten.
It is difficult to pass absolutely definite judgement on the thing; the man is not a born philosopher and, in addition, half self-taught.
Some of his sources (e.
g.
, Feuerbach, your book 3 and various trashy publications on the natural sciences) can be a the first volume of Capital 104.
Engels to Marx.
6 November 1868 153 immediately traced partly from his terminology, but one cannot tell what else he has read.
The terminology is, of course, still very confused, hence the lack of precision and frequent reiterations in new TERMS.
There is also dialectics in it, but appearing more in the form of flashes than in any connected way.
The presentation of the thing-in-itself as a conceivable thing [Gedankending] would be very nice and even brilliant if one could be certain that he himself had discovered it.
There is plenty of wit in it and, despite the poor grammar, a marked talent for style.
All in all, however, a remarkable instinct to think out so much that is correct on the basis of such inadequate studies.
The repetitions are, as I said, partly a result of the shortcomings in terminology, partly due to his lack of logical schooling.
It will be a hard job to get rid of them all.
If the man definitely wants to print his stuff, I do not know if the reduction to 2 printed sheets would be the best for him; in any case, it would be a frightful job for him, since he is not aware of his repetitions.
In addition, I do not know whether 2 sheets would get any attention at all.
6-8 sheets would be more likely to do this.
But he will never get it into a magazine.
Borkheim has written to ask whether I would agree that he should reprint my Bakunin article from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung* in Liebknecht's paper b and says, in this connection, that this article 'fits, for him, most excellently in his framework'.
I replied84 that we planned to publish our earlier articles, etc.
, jointly, that we were already negotiating with a book-dealer, but that I did not know how things stood at the moment and had therefore written to you.
I don't know though which article he means; there are several and he speaks of one.
Besides, he repeats his nonsense about Bakunin, Eichhoff, etc.
Eichhoff 's thorough defence 0 made me laugh.

105 MARX TO ENGELS 33 IN MANCHESTER London, 7 November 1868 a DEAR FRED, THANKS FOR THE £5.
I (and the whole household here) are very worried because of the typhus raging in your parts.
It is so contagious.
Please report again soon on the status rerum.
b It will be impossible to stop that damned Borkheim, whom I shall be seeing today, printing your 2 articles 0 (those about Bakunin's manifesto to the Slavsd ).
However, I shall only tell him that you are an old personal friend of Bakunin, so that the business may under no circumstances appear in a context insulting to the latter.
Borkheim takes himself completely au sérieux'' and really believes he has a political mission to fulfil.
He is translating for me the main passages from a Russian book about agrarian disintegration,' and has also given me a French book on the subject by the Russian Schédo-Ferroti.
g The latter is very much mistaken—he is altogether a very superficial fellow—in saying that the Russian communal system came into existence only as a result of the ban on peasants leaving the land.
The whole business, down to the smallest detail, is absolutely identical with the primaeval Germanic communal system.
Add to this, in the Russian case (and this may be found also amongst a part of the Indian communal systems, not in the Punjab, but in the South), (1) the non-democratic, but patriarchal character of the commune leadership and (2) the collective responsibility for taxes to the state, etc.
It follows from the second point that the more industrious a Russian peasant is, the more he is exploited by the state, not only in terms of taxes, but also for supplying provisions and horses, etc.
for the constant passage of troops, for government couriers, etc.
The whole shit is breaking down.

For the rest, I agree with everything you say.
I shall have something to say to him about the repetitions; it is his bad luck that it was precisely Hegel that he did not study.
The great Webera on behalf of 'German Association for Revolutionary Agitation, etc' has held a meeting together with the French Mayers under Pyat's chairmanship and with other vag­ abonds, at which they instructed the Yankees in an address218 to intervene in favour of the Spanish Republic.
Our Negro, Paul Lafargue, had the misfortune that the French would not recognise his English diploma; they want to make him run the gauntlet of five new examinations, instead of the maximum 1 or 2 as he expected.

107 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 10 November 1868 Dear Moor, Many thanks for settling things with Borkheim.
From the enclosed letter, which he wrote me, you can see what a 'nincompoop' the man is.
219 Sarah'sa sickness is taking a very favourable course; it is a simple typhoid fever, vulgo gastric fever; Gumpert expects no more relapses and, by the end of this week, she should be cured.
Against the contagion, which Gumpert also does not regard as dangerous, disinfection is a help.
Lizzie was in Lincolnshire, visiting a patriarchal variety of AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS who do well — they have gardens and potato land, the right of gleaning, which brings in a lot and, in addition, PASSABLE WAGES.
Parallel to this, however, the GANG SYSTEM is on the increase; she described it literally as you depicted it in your book.
220 These patriarchal FARM LABOURERS with land are naturally a declining remnant, and are already sending their children into the GANG, while they, for their part, provide the nurseries for the babies of the women working on neighbouring GANGS.
In Jacob Grimm's Spanish romances there is one in which Conde Claros de Montalban, son of Reinolt (Rinaldo) of the Haimon family, has a love affair with the Infanta, Charlemagne's daughter; the count takes her into a thicket in the garden, where they lie down b: de la cintura en arriba (upwards) muchos abrazos se dan, de la cintura en abajo como hombre y mujer se han.

Amicus3 Ernest Jones is now really catching it for becoming the obedient servant of Bright and Gladstone and identifying himself completely here with Bazley and Jacob Bright.
This afternoon, two large posters blazed on all the walls, one black and one red, presenting a passage from The People's Paper, recently reprinted in the Democrat (WHAT IS THAT?), in which he rejects the cursing and baiting of aristocrats as a bourgeois dodge, proclaims LABOUR AGAINST CAPITAL, and slates the Manchester Liberals as the workers' worst enemies, but all in his old style, you know.

109 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER London, 14 November 1868 DEAR FRED, BEST THANKS FOR £5.
For the past few days I have had once again the beginning of carbunculosem.
Since this muck always starts at this time, I immediately began again with the arsenic.
This should cut of* further EVOLUTION.
I am sending you subsequently (RATHER simultaneously) amusing cuttings from the Paris press, supplied by Lafargue.
You must send them back, since Jennychen collects the stuff.
Enclosed also a jolly cutting from Figaro on the people's economic conferences221 under the LEADERSHIP of Rabbi A.
Einhorn, GENERALLY KNOWN BY THE NAME OF /.
E.
Horn.
This idiot (who is, incidentally, skilled in the practice of agiotage) published SOME TIME SINCE a book on the banks,* of which even the Economist said it was obviously written only for children (although the Times reviewed it ceremoniously).
Apropos the Economist, you would be surprised to hear that, following the example of Thornton in the Fortnightly Review,h the Economist declared0 verbatim: 'No "LAW" OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY, IN ANY SENSE WHICH HAS YET BEEN ASSIGNED TO THESE WORDS, EXISTS; NEITHER IN FACT, NOR IN TENDENCY, DO MARKET PRICES CONFORM TO THE RULE COMMONLY SUPPOSED TO GOVERN THEM.
' The great Büchner has sent me his 'Sechs Vorlesungen etc.
über die Darwin'sche Theorie, etc' The book was not yet out when I was visiting Kugelmann.
77 And he (Büchner) has now already sent me the second edition] The way such books are made is NICE.
Büchner, for instance (as everybody who has read Lange's balderdash d knows anyway), states that his CHAPTER on materialist philosophy has been copied mainly from this very Lange.
And this same Büchner looks down pityingly on Aristotle, whom he obviously only knows by a I.

hearsay! What really amused me, however, was the following passage with regard to the works of Cabanis* (1798): ' You might almost be listening to Karl Vogt when you read (in Cabanis) expressions like these: "The brain is intended for thinking, as the stomach is meant for digestion or the liver for secreting the bile from the blood", etc.
' b Büchner obviously believes that Cabanis has copied from K.
Vogt.
Even to imagine the opposite exceeds the critical faculties of the worthy Büchner.
He appears to have first learned of Cabanis from Lange! Ce sont des savants sérieux!" Paris is haunted.
The Baudin affair is really reminiscent of the banquet movement under Louis Philippe.
222 Only today there is no National Guard, and Bugeaud (as far as brutality comes into play) is READY from the first day, while in February he was the last to be called upon and at a moment when there existed no ministry, that is to say, under the conditions at that time, no government.
Moreover, barricade-building is useless.
Leaving aside the Weberd-Pyat bulls of excommunication, I cannot see how a revolution in Paris could be SUCCESSFUL, apart from treason and defection or division in the army.
I have put a new bee into the bonnets of the Urquhartites (since Collet invited me and my family to visit him last Sunday weeke: I had not seen him personally for years), a bee that is now being very seriously debated between Collet and Urquhart, namely that Peel's Bank Act of 1844i2i makes it possible for the Russian Government, under CERTAIN CONJUNCTURES OF THE MONEY-MARKET, to force the Bank of England into bankruptcy.
5 Despite my diplomacy with Collet, I could not keep silent as he driveled on about Ireland, and told him MOST DECIDEDLY, to his face, my VIEWS ON THIS QUESTION.

18 November 1868 deserved his tumble OVER AND OVER.
102 With regard to Bradlaugh, he had boasted in too Lassallean a manner.
At the last Sunday meeting of his congregation in CLEVELAND HALL, there was displayed a placard TO THIS EFFECT: FAREWELL TO THE GREAT ICONOCLAST, THE PEOPLES REDEEMER.
LONG LlVE TO MR BRADLAUGH, THE DREAD NAUGHT OF ST STEPHEN'S! 229 In France things look very serious, according to Lafargue's last letters too.
The government wants to force the lads on to the streets so that chassepot250 and RIFLED CANNON may then laisser 'faire merveille' 3! Can you see any CHANCE of successful street conflicts? Defection of the army without a previous thrashing appears to me scarcely credible.
Biichner's clumsy workb is of interest to me in as much as it quotes most of the German research in the field of Darwinism — Prof.
Jäger (Vienna) and Prof.
Haeckel.
According to them, the cell has been abandoned as the primaeval form; instead a formless but contractile particle of albumen is taken as STARTING POINT.
This hypothesis was later confirmed by the discoveries in Canada (later also in Bavaria and SOME OTHER PLACES).
The primaeval form must naturally be traced down to the point at which it may be produced chemically.
And it appears that the way to this point has been found.
The conscientiousness with which Büchner has acquainted himself with the English stuff is also shown by the fact that he classifies Owen as one of Darwin's supporters.
Borkheim's letter to you,c which you sent me, I had the pleasure to have read to me for A SECOND TIME by him in person.
This nincompoop now accuses Eichhoff of being a 'BUSYBODY'(!) and of 'writing long letters'.
What self-knowledge! Apropos the Irish elections, the only interesting POINT is Dungarvan, where Burry is presenting himself under the protec­ tion of the defector O'Donovan.
(Ditto under the protection of the priest.
) There is a GENERAL CRY against him amongst the Irish Nationalists since this blackguard, as government prosecutor during the first trial of the Fenians in Dublin, hurled such slanders (à la Constitutionnel against the June insurgents) 231 that even the London papers gave him a wigging.

Manchester and Salford return 3 Tories'5 against 2 Liberals,' including the MILK-AND-WATER Bazley, Bolton, Preston, Blackburn, etc.

In Ashton it looks as if Milner Gibson has gone TO THE WALL.
Ernest Jones NOWHERE, despite the CHEERING.
Everywhere the proletariat are the RAG, TAG AND BOBTAIL of the official parties, and if any party has gained strength from the new VOTERS, it is the Tories.
The small towns, the HALF ROTTEN BOROUGHS 232 are the salvation of bourgeois Liberalism, and roles will be reversed: the Tories will favour more members for the big towns and the Liberals will favour unequal representation.
Here the electors have increased from 24,000 to not quite 48,000, and the Tories have increased their VOTERS from 6,000 to 14-15,000.
The Liberals have let slip a lot, and M.
Henry did a lot of harm, but it cannot be denied that the increase in working-class VOTES has brought the Tories more than their simple percentage, and has improved their relative position.
On the whole this is a good thing.
As things look now, Gladstone should have a narrow majority and will be compelled to change the Reform Bill to stop the rolling stone; with a large majority, he would have let things take their course, as usual.

Militairement parlant,3 the fellows in Paris have NOT THE GHOST OF A CHANCE, if they launch their attack at present.
It is not so easy to get out of this Bonapartism.
Without a military revolt, nothing can be done.
In my opinion, a coup can only be attempted when at least the garde mobile 233 once again stands between the people and the army.
It is certain and obvious that Bonaparte wants an attempt, and the revolutionaries would be jackasses if they gave him the satisfaction.
In addition, the new rifles (1) can very easily be rendered useless (by extracting the pin) and (2) even if they fall into the hands of the insurgents in a usable state, they are valueless if you do not have the specific ammunition, which you cannot make like the old cartridges.
And why, in fact, should they launch their attack just at this moment? The continuation of this a militarily speaking 115.

23 November 1868 it—that, purely for the joy of MISCHIEFMONGERING, I set new bees in their bonnets about the Peel Act of 1844223 and its useful effect for Russia.
(Incidentally the matter is correct WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS.
) Now Urquhart wants to print one of these letters over my name in his NEXT Diplomatic Review.
254 If I refused 'my name', I would make them mistrustful.
So I am IN FOR IT.
It is a consolation that not a soul reads the Diplomatic Review (EXCEPT A SMALL CLIQUE).
The Urquhartites, however, are burning their fingers too.
In order to give the affair more weight, they obviously intend to cite me as the author of Capital, which would be AN ABOMINATION in their eyes if they knew it.
As regards Ernest Jones, I find him EXCEEDINGLY COOL.
/ should act for him as ELECTIONEERING AGENT (for Greenwich)! I have replied 84 that I see not a GHOST OF A CHANCE for him: 1.
Baxter Langley is the local candidate, and neither Mill nor Beales COULD STAND without his PERMISSION.
2.
The GENERAL COUNCIL of the 'International' does not get mixed up in ELECTIONEERING.
In no case could we act against B.
Langley because—and this is a fact—since the Brussels Congress138 B.
Langley and his SUNDAY LEACUE235 have concluded an amicable agreement with us.
(In fact, our sessions take place in their hall.
) 3.
He (Jones) is at present unpopular in London (and this is true).
Reynolds's ARTICLES: 'TRAITORS IN THE CAMP', etc.
, had damaged him.
236 I have just received the enclosed letter from the secretary3 of the Workers' Educational Society here.
67 This shows that the Lassalleans imported from Paris and Germany, who maintain secret contacts with Schweitzer, have made use of Lessner's absence due to his wife's sickness in order fraudulently to obtain from here a vote of confidence for Schweitzer against the Nurembergers.
135 As a well-known member of the Society, I would be made responsible for this—and this appears to me to be the aim of the whole operation.
Thus I am writing to Speyer without delay explaining the reasons that, under these cir­ cumstances, I must announce my resignation from the Society.

158 I intend, if all goes well, to take 3 years, the last of which would be without any obligation on my part to work.
If all this is successful, which must be more or less decided by the end of February at the latest, we are over the hill, and I shall be able without difficulty to pay off the £100 debt you still have, and in general to establish the affair properly and on a solid basis, so that this load of debts will not return, at least for the period of the contract.
Lizzie suddenly became very unwell yesterday; I thought at first it was serious, but she has slept a lot, so is now much better.
She had congestions to the head.

HOLZENHAUER 237 IN COLOGNE [Draft] [Manchester,] 26 November 1868 Following receipt of your letter dated 18 August I inquired at home 84 about the circumstances in which you had left my brothers'238 business and also sought to find out whether there was any prospect of your obtaining employment there again.
Now I have received the relevant information, and unfortunate­ ly it is such that I can offer you no hope whatsoever of obtaining employment there again.
I am therefore returning to you enclosed the false, as you say, testimony of my brother-in-law.
3 In view of the information received, I must, it is true, assume this testimony does not wholly correspond to reality, a fact on which you may congratulate yourself, to be sure.
Respectfully yours, F.
E.
Published for the first time Printed according to the original 119 ENGELS TO MARX 239 IN LONDON Manchester, 29 November 1868 Dear Moor, Consider very precisely the answers to the enclosed questions, and answer them for me by return, so that I may have your reply on Tuesday morning.
1.
How much money do you need to pay all your debts, so AS TO HAVE A CLEAR START? 2.
Can you manage with £350 for your usual regular needs for a year (from this I exclude extra expenses caused by sickness and unforeseen events), i.
e.
, so that you do not need to get into debt.
If not, tell me the sum required for it.
All on the assumption that a Adolf von Griesheim 8-983 all the old debts have previously been paid off.
This question is naturally the main one.
My negotiations with Gottfried Ermena are taking the turn that, on the termination of my contract,—June 30—he wishes to buy me out, i.
e.
, he offers me a sum of money if I undertake not to enter into any competing business for 5 years, and allow him to continue to manage the firm.
This is exactly where I wanted to get the man.
However, since in the past few years the balances have been poor, it is questionable whether this offer will place us in a position to live for a number of years without money troubles, even if we assume the probable case that all sorts of events will cause us to move again to the continent, and hence get us involved in extra expenses.
The sum offered me by Gottfried Ermen (which, long before he offered it to me, I was determined to devote, if need be exclusively, to covering the necessary support for you) would put me in a position to provide you certainly with £350 annually for 5-6 years, and in special cases even with some more.
You will, however, understand that all my arrangements would be upset if, from time to time, a sum of debts accumulated that would have to be covered out of further capital.
My calculations have to be based upon the fact that our living expenses must be met not solely from revenue, but also—from the beginning—partly from capital, and for this very reason they are rather complicated and must be adhered to strictly, or we shall come to grief.
I would ask you to tell me quite frankly how these matters really stand, and your reply will determine how I conduct myself in the future vis-à-vis Gottfried Ermen.
So, name yourself the sum you need regularly per annum, and we shall see what can be done.
What will happen after the 5-6 years mentioned above is not clear to me either.
If everything remains as at present, I would no longer be in a position to send you £"350 a year or even more, but still at least £"150.
Yet much may change by then, and your literary work will be capable of bringing something in for you.
Best greetings to your wife and the girls.

30 November 1868 171 120 MARX TO ENGELS 80 IN MANCHESTER London, 30 November 1868 DEAR FRED, I am quite KNOCKED DOWN by your too great kindness.
I had my wife show me all the BILLS, and the amount of the debts is much greater than I thought, £210 (of which ABOUT £75 for the pawnshop and interest).
This does not include the doctor's BILL for attendance during the SCARLATINA, which he has not yet submitted.
During the past few years we have used more than £350, but the sum is absolutely sufficient, since 1.
during the past few years Lafargue was living with us, and expenses were much increased by his presence in the house; and 2.
, owing to the debt system, everything cost much too much.
With a complete CLEARANCE of the debts, I would be able for the first time to enforce a STRICT ADMINISTRATION.
You can imagine how unpleasant conditions have been here at home over the past few months from the fact that Jennychen — behind my back—got an engagement for herself as private governess with an English family.
The business is not due to begin until January 1869.
I gave permission, after the event, on the proviso (the lady of the house, her husband is Dr Monroe, visited my wife in this connection) that the engagement should only be binding for 1 month, and both sides, after the month had passed, would have the right to cancel Though the matter was extremely embarrassing to me (the child would have to teach small children almost all day long)—I do not need to emphasise this—I consented on this condition, since I found it favourable that Jennychen would be diverted by some sort of occupation and, in particular, get outside these 4 walls.
For years now my wife has quite lost her TEMPER—understandable under the circumstances, but not thereby made pleasanter—and tortures the children mortally with her complaints and irritability and BAD HUMOUR, though no children could bear it all IN A MORE JOLLY WAY.
But sunt certi denique fines? It is naturally UNPLEASANT to write to you about this.
It •' there are, after all, certain limits (Horace, Satires, I, 1, 106).

On one point he is right—Wilhelm'sb incapability! His claim that the Nurembergers 135—on pain of high treason—should enroll under his leadership is VERY COOL INDEED.
240 Wilhelm becomes stupider every day.
What a lousy paper! c From the letter from Lugau 241 it emerges that he has so far done nothing with reference to the International.
At the same time, he plays fine tricks on us.
In his 'cosy' way, he announces that the 'International Working Men's Association' costs nothing, so that all and sundry may join without paying.
From Switzerland Becker complains about this absurdity.

5 December 1868 173 122 MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 29 IN HANOVER London, 5 December 1868 Dear Kugelmann, Have you got Dietzgen's address? Quite a while ago he sent me a fragment of a manuscript on 'intellectual capacity',185 which, despite a certain confusion and too frequent repetitions, contained much that was excellent, and—as the independent product of a worker—even admirable.
I did not reply immediately after reading it through, since I wanted to hear Engels' opinion.
3 So I sent him the manuscript.
A long time passed before I got it back.
And now I cannot find Dietzgen's letter with his new address.
He wrote me, to wit, in his last letter from Petersburg, that he would return to the Rhine and settle there.
Have you perhaps received his address from him? If so, be so kind as to send it to me by return.
My conscience—one never becomes completely free of this sort of thing—is pricking me for leaving Dietzgen so long without a reply.
You also promised to tell me something about his personality.
I have received Büchner's lectures on Darwinism.
He is obviously a 'book-maker' and probably for this reason is called 'Büchner'.
b His superficial babble about the history of materialism is obviously copied from Lange.
c The way such a whipper-snapper disposes of, e.
g.
, Aristotle—quite a different sort of natural philosopher from Büchner —is really astonishing.
It is also very naive of him to say, referring to Cabanis, 'you might almost be listening to Karl Vogt'.
d As if Cabanis copied Vogt! Some time ago I promised to write you a few words about the FRENCH BRANCH.
These RAGAMUFFINS are, a half or 2/3 of them, maquereaux' and such-like rabble, and all of them—after our people had withdrawn—heroes of the revolutionary phrase, who, FROM A SAFE DISTANCE, OF COURSE, kill kings and emperors, in particular Louis Napoleon.
In their eyes we are, naturally, reactionaries, and a See this volume, pp.

Marx to Kugelmann.
5 December 1868 they drew up, in all due form, an indictment against us, which was, in fact, submitted to the Brussels Congress—in the closed sessions.
The fury of these BLACKLEGS was heightened by the fact that they had been taken over by Felix Pyat, a failed French fourth-class author of melodramas, who, in the revolution of '48, was only used as a TOASTMASTER—(the name given by the English to the men paid to announce the TOASTS at public banquets, or to supervise the order of the TOASTS)—a man who has a perfect monomania 'TO SHOUT IN A WHISPER' and to play the dangerous conspirator.
Pyat wanted to use this gang to convert the 'International Working Men's Association' into his following.
In particular, the aim was to compromise us.
Thus, at a public MEETING which the FRENCH BRANCH announced and trumpeted by poster as a meeting of the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION, Louis Napoleon, alias Badinguet,3 was in all due form sentenced to death, the execution naturally being left to the nameless Brutuses of Paris.
b Since the English press paid no attention to this farce, we also would have passed it over in silence.
But one of the gang—a certain Vesinier, a circulator of chantage" literature—spread the whole muck in the Belgian paper La Cigale, which claims to be an organ of the 'International', a sort of 'comic' paper, the like of which certainly cannot be found anywhere else in Europe.
There is, you see, nothing comic about it except its seriousness.
From the Cigale the stuff found its way into the Pays, Journal de l'Empire.
It was naturally grist to the mill of Paul de Cassagnac.
Thereupon we—i.
e.
THE GENERAL COUNCIL—officially announced, in 6 lines in the Cigale, that F.
Pyat had absolutely no connection with the 'International', of which he was not even a member.
d Hinc illae iraele This f rog-and-mouse warf ended when the FRENCH BRANCH rancorously withdrew from us, and it now goes about its business on its own, under Pyat's auspices.
They have established here, in London, as a succursale^ a so-called German Agitational Association, consisting of a dozen and a half, headed by an old refugee from the Palatinate, the half-crazy watchmaker Weber.

5 December 1868 175 through one of his friends, writing ditto in the Cigale, made Pyat absolutely ridiculous, leaving him only the alternative of being either a MONOMANIAC or a police agent.
3 Yesterday evening I received a letter from Schweitzer240 announcing that he was off to the cachoth again, and that the outbreak of civil war — that is war between him and W.
Lieb­ knecht — is unavoidable.
I must say that Schweitzer is right on one point, that is, Liebknecht's incompetence.
His sheet c is really wretched.
How can a man whom I crammed orally for 15 years (he was always too lazy to read) have such things published as, for instance, Society and State, in which 'the social' (and that's a fine category too!) is treated as the secondary, and 'the political' as the essential?0 This would be incomprehensible were it not that Liebknecht is a South German, and seems always to have confused me with his old superior, the 'noble' Gustav Struve.
Lafargue and wife have been in Paris for 2 months.
There, however, they don't want to recognise the medical qualifications he achieved in London, and demand that he take 5 new 'Paris' exams! As the result of a SETTLEMENT, my 'economic' (not politico-economic) circumstances will take a satisfactory form from next year.
e With best greetings to your dear wife and Fränzchen.

That things would come to this pass with Schweitzer was fairly clear to me from previous practical experience.
This honourable gentleman was not-inclined to hand over his 'strict' organisation, headed by the nominal king of the tailors; for him the only question was whether good old Wilhelm b would subordinate himself to him or not.

9 December 1868 already had himself 'recommended' to us in this capacity by Cremer, Huleck, etc.
We did not want him.
) Finally a reappearance CARD from Nincompoop.
3 This letter is very characteristic of him.
Schily took him to Lafargue et Co.
You know that in Paris you can only move in on the terme}' Lafargue and Laura thus lived in a chambre garnie, 0 high up, until about a fortnight ago (when they found lodgings, and we sent them their chests and boxes).
The first thing Borkheim said when he came to visit them with Schily: 'This has put me quite out of breath.
I would not like often to climb so high!' And now his marginal notes, which he sends to me\ Incidentally, he has kept his promise about 'not-climbing'.
Lafargue had bought the Ténot, d but since the postage to London is dear, Borkheim was supposed to bring the book here on his return journey to Bordeaux.
But he was not seen again.
And this reminds me of another anecdote concerning Bork­ heim.
Shortly before Lafargue left, Borkheim invited him and my family to dinner (Laura did not go).
After the 'gentlemen' had retired to Borkheim's STUDY — the gentlemen were Lafargue, Bork­ heim and myself—Borkheim related all sorts of gossip told or published by one person or another about me.
I let him have his head for a time, while Lafargue rocked crossly backwards and forwards in his chair.
Finally I interrupted him and said: It was altogether extraordinary what gossip went round in the world.
Engels and I could tell the best stories about this, because we possessed proper archives about the refugees.
For instance, when he—Borkheim—came from Switzerland to England, we received a report that he was an agent of the Prussian Count X e (I cannot JUST NOW recall the name), who was himself a Prussian spy, and that it had been this count that had sent him to Switzerland, etc.
Borkheim exploded like a bomb.
'He had never thought that anybody at all in London knew anything about this story, etc' He then started to tell the story at great length and in great detail and, in his excitement, pumped too much HOT WATER and even more BRANDY into himself.
In this OVERWORKED condition we then returned to the ladies for tea, and Borkheim at once burst out with the announcement that I had given him THE MOST STRANGE SURPRISE of his life.
He then told the same story three times in succession, to the great annoyance of his wife, since all sorts of females play a role in a S.

Later he wrote to me twice: I had obviously been joking, he had probably himself told me the gossip about him, etc.
I, however, remained serious.
(We had learned about the business from Schily, in one of his letters from Paris, at the time of the Vogt affair.
) There must be punishment! Apropos.
Something that remained a mystery to me for a long time was this: during the 3 years of the cotton FAMINE, where did the English get all that cotton, even for the DIMINISHED SCALE OF PRODUCTION?246 It was impossible to explain this from the official statistics.
Despite all the imports from India, etc.
, there was seen to be quite an enormous deficit if you calculated the exports to the Continent (and even the occasional ones to New England).
Nothing, or almost nothing, remained for HOME CONSUMPTION.
The business was easily solved.
It has now been proved (a fact perhaps known to you, but new to me) that, at the outbreak of the Civil War, the English had verbotenus* approximately 3 years' stock (naturally for a DIMINISHED SCALE OF PRODUCTION).
What a fine crash that would have produced if the Civil War had not broken out! The EXPORTS OF YARN and MANUFACTURED GOODS in 1862, 1863 and 1864 were= 1,208,920,000 lbs (REDUCED TO YARN) and the SUPPLIES (IMPORTS) (REDUCED TO EQUIVALENT WEIGHT IN YARN)= 1,187,369,000 lbs.
In the first figure, the surplus of baryta hidden in the MANUFACTURED GOODS has probably been overlooked.
Even so, the result roughly emerges that the entire HOME SUPPLY was met from existing stocks.

10 December 1868 126 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 10 December 1868 DEAR FRED, You must return the enclosed letter to me immediately after reading it, since I must send it back to Kugelmann.
247 Kugelmann (there is nothing else worthy of notice in his letter, which I am not sending, as I wish to reply to him) has this to say about Dr Freund, the 'author' of the letter: 'Recently, in Dresden, I recruited a promising pupil for you in the shape of a very intelligent colleague, a university teacher in Breslau.
He told me he had written a small study on the worker question.
I recommended him to read your book 3 before publishing his study.
His own reflections had led him to Malthusian ideas.
— I would like to have the enclosed letter returned quite soon, since I still have to reply to it.
— Freund is now engaged in an epoch-making uior^dealing with the development of the normal and pathological pelvis, in particular, and of the skeleton, in general.
In Dresden he gave a lecture on this that created a sensation.
The professors and privy councillors received his brilliant discoveries with a dignified air of superiority, which vexed me.
At the close of our section meeting I said a few words in order to emphasise Freund's achievements in a complimentary manner and I asked those who agreed with me to rise.
The entire section rose, but—they were perfidious enough to omit this ovation from the minutes of the meeting.
When I wanted to insist on its inclusion, Freund intervened himself and said he did not wish it.
I believe he now regrets this.
This is to make his letter understandable.
When his work appears, Engels will, in any case, have to plough through it'.

11 December 1868 181 127 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON [Manchester,] 11 December 1868 Dear Moor, I return you 2 letters, the most the ENVELOPE can hold, in all haste; I wanted to write to you from the office, but was held up, and the last post will be leaving soon out here.
Nincompoop3 is extremely charming and tactful.
This honourable gentleman appears to need to apply the sNOB-standard everywhere.
When you see him, just ask him sometime if he is related to Mr Hersch Kriminand, and where the man lives.
(This gentleman exists and signs himself exactly thus; he lives in Lemberg.
) Then you can ask him what Lemberg is called.
Polish Lwow, Little Russian and Great Russian AbBOBi>, that is to say Lvov or Löwenstadt from lev b=lion.
The Jews translate that as Löwenberg, abbreviated Lemberg.
Here we have the finest crisis, and this time pure (though only relative) overproduction.
The spinners and manufacturers have, for nearly 2 years now, on their own account, been consigning goods unsaleable here to India and China, thus doubly overload­ ing the overloaded markets.
This is no longer possible, and they are failing right and left.
One of the first victims was Knowles, our fatty, who failed not so much because of consignments, but through general corporeal weakness—the 4 brothers had simply gobbled, up the money.
I call this overproduction relative because it only becomes overproduction as a result of the cotton prices, which are still high.
Two pence difference would and will suffice to absorb the whole lot lying around.

We lived on this in 1861 and even 1862, and the highest prices came only in 1863.
But this also depended on other things—the effective blockade of the Southern harbours, etc.

But there was never any question of 3 years' reserve, that is enormously exaggerated.
If you like, I can compile the things for you from the official report (i.

You know that, ABOUT 6 weeks ago, I felt something carbuncular and then re-started imbibing arsenic, and I am still at it.
In fact, nothing has appeared except constant small preliminaries, which just as constantly disappear again.
For years the business always began in October, and by January was in full bloom.
Now it looks as though I shall escape it this year, and that only enough traces of the sickness reappeared and are reappearing as were necessary to induce me to take arsenic.
In his latest speech in Edinburgh, in which Huxley again took a more materialist stand than in recent years, he opened up another loophole for himself.
248 As long as we really observe and think, we can never escape materialism.
But all this is reduced to the relationship between cause and effect, and 'your great compatriot Hume' has already proved that these categories have nothing in a The table, which Marx gives in English, is from the article 'A Phase of the Cotton Trade during the Civil War', published in The Economist, No.

But do not let this keep you from taking up your pen again soon.
The letter from Freund (returned enclosed, with thanks) interested me greatly.

I also return the portrait of Dietzgen.

But I always had a feeling he was 'not a worker like Eccarius'.
In fact, the sort of philosophical outlook he has worked out for himself demands a certain calmness and disposable time that the EVERYDAY WORKMAN does not enjoy.
I have two very good workers living in New York, A.

Everyone who knows anything of history also knows that great social revolutions are impossible without the feminine ferment.
Social progress may be measured precisely by the social position of the fair sex (plain ones included).
As far as the 'SETTLEMENT' is concerned, there could never, from the outset, have been any question of my taking over a business before my book was finished.
Otherwise I could long have extricated myself from any embarrassing situation.
The fact is simply this—but strictly between us—that, on the one hand, I made an arrangement with my family; on the other, Engels, without my knowledge, through agreement with his PARTNER about his own income (he is leaving the business in June), has made a SETTLEMENT for me, as a result of which, from next year, I shall be able to work in peace.

13 December 1868 131 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 13 December 1868 Dear Moor, If the envelope holds them, I shall send back Meyer and Serno,251 otherwise tomorrow from the office, where I have larger envelopes.
In Meyer's letter, the juxtaposition of Bohemians and Chinese amused me.
Otherwise, his false Jacob-Grimm style is a bit much for me, the art of saying as little as possible with secretive circumlocutions, and putting that little unclearly.
For a Russian, Serno writes remarkably poor French; for his pamphlet3 he must have had a lot of help.
If Nincompoopb knew you were corresponding with a Russian! You can then tell him 1.
that the name Serno, as a masculine, is impossible in Great Russian since o is a neuter ending, whereas in Little Russian male names ending in o are very frequent, thus the man is no Muscovite but a Ruthenian, a Malorossc; 2.
that he is a born member of the Brimstone Gang252; serny—ctpHbin — means sulphurous, from sera, sulphur; Solovyevich means son of the nightingale.
I am eager to see the sheet published by these people,d particularly what sort of a science he, Serno, will propound, since he so curses the ignorance of the French.
However, such a French journal is always very good, much better than the Belgian Proudhonist sheets.
The story about Nincompoop is very neat.
e Only now do I understand what you meant with the cotton business', however, you had omitted that this also included the stocks of yarn and fabrics.
But then it must be noted that, to explain things rationally, you must include 1861, when the collosal 4 million crop of 1860 gradually arrived here.
How ELLISON & HAYWOOD could omit this8 is incomprehensible to me, unless the people had a particular business purpose in their statistics.

American crop of 1860, which came to England in [18]61, at the time of the PAPER BLOCKADE 253 is the basis of all the later production.
I shall see to it that I send you the necessary data on the subject, at least regarding raw cotton.
Of course, this in no way changes the fact that, without the American War, there would certainly have been, in 1861-62, an absolutely colossal collapse, this time as the result of pure, unalloyed and unconcealed overproduction.
Weighting with CHINA CLAY (this CHINA lies in Derbyshire and Staffordshire; it is fine potter's earth, and CHINA here means porcelain) has only gained ground since 1863-64.
For some years it was the secret of a comparative few.
Recently, somebody was sentenced to £1,060 DAMAGES because of this, and I hope that, as soon as I am out of the firm, they will also tackle Gottfried on account of the talc-stone he sells as cotton yarn.
Tussy may well curse about the yarn when 25 to 30% of it consists of sour meal sweetened with talc-stone.
I am very glad the arsenic was and continues to be so effective.
I wish I were through with the murky business with Gottfried Ermen.
a I cannot trust the rogue further than I can see him, and have to take all possible precautions.
I still haven't even received the draft agreement; he puts the blame on the lawyer, but I blame it on the fact that he himself is still mulling over what additional chicanery for me he can get included in it.
Luckily, I possess an epistle from him in which he himself makes the relevant proposal to me, and I myself drafted the memorandum given to the lawyer as a basis.
But I already note that he is keen for me to take money out of the firm before I am quite in the clear with him—then he would have me in his hand and could squeeze me.
But as soon as I have the draft, and find it to be FAIRLY DRAWN UP, I shall send you enough for you to pay off your debts and have some CASH IN HAND, and from the New Year the new arrangement will begin.
I may come to visit you for a few days myself, but Nincompoop and his consorts must not know of this.

188 132 MARX TO ENGELS 174 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 14 December 1868 DEAR FRED, On Saturday evening3 Ténot (Paris and Provinces)* and the proceedings of the Baudin trial 222 arrived.
I am sending you Ténot (Paris) and Baudin today.
The Ténot (Provinces) you will receive in a few days.
You can bring the whole lot back yourself, for nobody in the house except me has yet read the things.
In the Ténot (Paris) I find little new, except a few details—I have not yet read the Provinces.
The enormous sensation created by the book in Paris, and in France as a whole, proves a very interesting FACT, namely that the generation that has grown up under Badinguet c knew nothing at all about the history of the regime under which it is living.
Now the fellows are rubbing their eyes and are quite thunderstruck.
If one may parva componere magnis, d have we not had precisely the same experience in our own way? In Germany the story is spreading, as a remarkable novelty, that Lassalle was only one of our satellites, and that he did not discover the 'class struggle'.
I can discover nothing special in the speech by Gambetta," who is now being lionised in France.
His manner reminds me strikingly of Michel de Bourges.
This Michel also made his name through a political trial.
A few months before the February revolution he declared that he had abandoned his belief in 'democracy', since it always turned into 'demagogy'.
Of course, this did not prevent him from shining as a républicain de la veille 1 after February, and rendering excellent service to Bonaparte, nolens or volens, g particularly in the question of quaestors.
254 He was also MORE OR LESS in contact with the republican 'Plon-Plon'.
I was really delighted to read again IN FULL the deliberations of the 'républicains modérés', i.

3 The only FACT of importance to me was—and this is certainly unprecedented—that for 3 years nothing was manufactured for the home market (I mean from the freshly-imported raw materials during those 3 years, or those only intended to make up stock).
Asher, the booksellers here (a BRANCH of the Berlin one, Unter den Linden) have written to me that they need a few COPIES of Herr Vogt in Berlin.
b That infernal Wilhelm, 0 as you know, never answered a very pressing letter I sent him months ago, 84 except to say that he had frittered away the 300 copies turned over to him, but that a few still existed in Berlin.

As OLD Becker writes, this association should make up for the deficient 'idealism' of our Association.
L'idéalisme Russe! There was great anger about the document this evening at the meeting of our Conseil General, particularly among the French.
I had known about the shit for a long time.
I regarded it as stillborn, and out of consideration for OLD Becker, wanted to let it die a quiet death.
But the business has become more serious than I expected.
And consideration for OLD Becker is no longer admissible.

You can keep Province there; I have ordered them both at the bookshop; one really must have things of this sort.
The complete oblivion of revolutionary-counterrevolutionary causality is a necessary result of every victorious reaction; in Germany the younger generation knows absolutely nothing about '48, except the wretched howls of the Kreuzzeitung, which echoed in '49-52 in all the papers; history comes to an abrupt stop there at the end of '47.

It is as clear as daylight that the International cannot get involved in this fraud.

18 December 1868 deux conseils généraux.
Du reste, qui vous donne le droit de reconnaître un soi-disant bureau central sans mandataires dont les membres appartenants à la même nationalité se constituent (§ 3 du règlement on omet le 'se' et pour cause!) en bureau national de leur pays! Ces messieurs, n'ayant pas de constituants, eux-mêmes exceptés, veulent que l'Internationale se constituât en mandataire pour eux.
Si l'Internationale refuse de le faire, qui reconnaîtrait 'le groupe initiateur' autrement dit le 'bureau central' pour ses représentants? Le conseil central de l'Internationale au moins a passé par trois élections successives et tout le monde sait qu'il représente des myriades d'ouvriers; mais ces 'initiateurs'? Et puis si nous voulons bien faire abstraction de la formalité d'élection, que représentent les noms qui forment ce groupe initiateur? ce groupe qui prétend de se donner 'pour mission spéciale d'étudier les questions politiques et philosophiques etc.
'? Ce sera sans doute la science qu'ils représenteront.
Nous trouverons parmi eux des hommes dont il est notoire qu'ils ont passé leur vie entière à l'étude de ces questions? Au contraire.
Pas un nom dont le porteur ait, jusqu'ici, même osé prétendre à passer pour un homme de science.
S'ils sont sans mandats comme représentants de la démocratie sociale, ils le sont encore mille fois plus comme représentants de la science.
3 The rest you remarked upon in your notes.
Like you, I regard a There would be two General Councils and even two Congresses: this would be a state within the state and, right from the start, conflict would break out between the practical Council in London, and the theoretical, 'idealist', Council in Geneva.
In the International there cannot be two (professional) international bodies, any more than two General Councils.
Incidentally, who gives you the right to recognise a so-called Central Bureau without mandators, whose members will be of the same nationality and who constitute themselves (in paragraph 3 of the Rules this 'themselves' is omitted, and with good reason!) the national bureau of their country! Since these gentlemen have no mandators except themselves, they wish the International to constitute itself their mandator.
If the International refuses to do so, who would recognise the 'initiating group' or, in other words, the 'Central Bureau' as its representatives? The Central Council of the International has passed through at least three successive elections, and the whole world knows that it represents countless workers; but these 'initiators'? And even if we wished to ignore the formalities of an election, what is represented by the names that make up this initiating group, this group that pretends to have been given 'the special mission to study political and philosophical questions, etc.
'? No doubt it is science they will represent.
Will we find among them men known to have devoted their whole lives to the study of these questions? On the contrary.
There is not a name whose bearer has so far dared as much as to claim to be a man of science.
If they are without mandate as representatives of social democracy, they are a thousand times more without mandate as representa­ tives of science.

18 December 1868 193 the business as a stillborn, purely Genevan local growth.
It would only be viable if you were to oppose it too violently, and thus gave it importance.
I think it would be best calmly but firmly to rebuff these people with their pretensions to sneaking into the Interna­ tional.
Apart from this, we should say that they had selected a special field and one would have to wait to see what they make of it and, we should also say that, for the present, there was nothing to stop members of one association from being members of the other.
Since the fellows, to put it bluntly, have no other field of activity than chatter, they will soon enough bore one another to death, and since it may be expected that they will have no new adherents from outside (given such conditions), the whole concern will certainly soon collapse.
But if you violently oppose this Russian intrigue, you will unnecessarily arouse the very numer­ ous— particularly in Switzerland—political philistines among the journeymen, and harm the International.
With a Russian (and in this case there are 4,a not counting the females), with a Russian one must never lose one's TEMPER.
I have never read anything more wretched than the theoretical programme.
Siberia, his stomach, and the young Polish woman"5 have made Bakunin a perfect blockhead.
My trip will probably not come to anything before the New Year, the damned draft contract0 is still not ready.

He set himself up here and went bankrupt certainly once, if not twice, and virtually nothing came of it.
Many years ago I sometimes met him at an inn in the evening; since he married I have scarcely seen him at all, and I know absolutely nothing of what he has been doing since then.
But what do you want an agent in Munich for? Tell Mother I still haven't received the draft contract from G.
Ermen; he blames the lawyers.
11 The point is that he would like to have me withdraw large sums of money from the business at this moment; then he would have me at his mercy, but we are not as green in the eye as that.
Be so kind as to send me my current account in the course of January, since I would like to pay off the sum owed as soon as I am clear with G.
Ermen.
You could also say whether I should remit to Funke or there.
If I had wished to drive things with G.
Ermen to extremes, that is, risk a breach, and had then had to start something else, I think I could have squeezed out about £750 more.
But I had absolutely no interest in being tied to jolly old commerce for about another 10 years—and it wouldn't have been worth starting a new business again for a shorter period.

From his letter I see that he has once again written at length to De Paepe, in order to lure him into the Alliance Internationale.
265 To prevent later MISCHIEF or later complaints about the lack of timely information, you must dispatch to De Paepe as soon as possible a COPY of our resolution on the Alliance.
3 Of course, you must tell him, at the same time, that, because of the present state of affairs in Switzerland266 and in order to avoid any appearance of SCISSION, we do not wish to have the resolution published, but are confining ourselves to communicating it confidentially to the respective central councils in the various countries.
Do not forget to invite Applegarth to the Saturday session in good time.

199 1869 140 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 1 January 1869 DEAR FRED, HAPPY NEW YEAR! From the enclosed letter from Lafargue you will see that I have received a special NEW YEARS GIFT—THE DIGNITY OF GRANDFATHER.
3 From the attached 2 numbers printed in Paris—Cloche and Diable à quatre —you can see what an arrogant tone prevails there.
It should be compared to the language used by the opposition in Prussia! This petite presse h—and its men included even Rochefort —was the Bonaparte regime's very own product.
Now it is the most dangerous weapon against it.
From the enclosed issues of the Vorbotec you can learn about the scandal in Basle.
266 These bloody fellows—I mean our spokesmen over there—have a talent all their own for making the International Working Men's Association responsible for every local QUARREL between MASTER and MEN.
At the same time, they neglect to take any measures for the event of war, i.
e.
, establishing TRADES UNIONS.
Instead they shout the more loudly.
The petty cantonal government intervenes.
The smallest incident thus becomes important.
Then comes an appeal to the International Working Men's Association in general and the London General Council in particular to pay, ON THE SHORTEST NOTICE, the Swiss war costs.
And then 'old man' Becker writesd that we should not 'compromise' ourselves again, as in the Geneva affair,16 etc.

I expect you and your wife cannot look at each other without laughing about the new dignity.
The Basle business is not quite clear to me from the Vorbote,b so I am waiting anxiously for the promised additions, and also the further course of the Bakuniad.
Bakunin's speeches in the Kolokol are very stupid.
c The fellow does not appear to have learned anything for donkey's years.
I was interested to learn from the above that he and Herzen are still in collusion with each other.
Hence Herzen must be completely done for, otherwise he would not give up KoAOKOAT>.

Marx, Bd.
4, Stuttgart, igj3 Published in English for the first time 142 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER London, 13 January 1869 DEAR FRED, THANKS for the numbers of Zukunft (Thesmar and Georgios Jung!) I put off writing to you from day to day because of a frightful cold which, for ABOUT 2 WEEKS, has been absolutely besieging my eyes, ears, nose and entire head.
Since, however, this damned foggy weather still gives no hope of an early delivery from the evil, I shall wait no longer.
Is it so pleasant at your place in Manchester too? Little wonder that SUICIDES are in full blossom here now.
Only an Irishman, even in Seven Dials,269 says THAT HE WOULD RATHER COMMIT SUICIDE ON ANY ONE THAN HIMSELF.
Did the young Th.
von Gimborn from Emmerich, manufacturer in nuce* present himself to you? It is not quite clear to me what he wants.
First, he told me he wanted to go into a factory as a technician for a certain period, SAY half a year, or as a simple worker, in order to study the organisation, etc.
, of English factory work.
Now it is only a question of a 14-day stay in a factory supplying agricultural machinery.
Does Gimborn, AFTER ALL, simply wish to discover English factory secrets? He won't find it easy.
Now a short report about the 'international incidents'.
a) 'Alliance Internationale de la Démocratie Socialiste' 257: On a budding manufacturer 9-983 22 December 1868, a unanimous decision of the General Council which stated: 1.
Tous les articles du Règlement de l'Alliance, etc.
statuant sur les relations avec l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, sont déclarés nuls et de nul effet; 2.
l'Alliance etc.
n'est pas admise comme branche de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs.
3 The reasoning behind this decision (which I edited), is stated completely in legal form, and shows the conflict between the statutes of the planned Alliance and our Rules, 270 etc.
A final considérant^ which must show old Becker, c in particular, his asininity, is that the Brussels Congress 1S8 already set a precedent with respect to the Ligue de la Paix et de la Liberté.
271 With regard to this organisation, which wanted to be recognised by the International Association, the Congress declared: Since the League claims to follow the same principles and to pursue the same aims as the International Association, it has no 'raison d'être' and, considérant this, stated finally, 'plusieurs membres du groupe initiateur de Genève" 1 also voted in this sense in Brussels.
In the meantime, we have received letters from Brussels, Rouen, Lyon, etc.
, declaring unconditional support for the General Council decision.
Not one voice has been raised in support of le groupe initiateur de Genève.
That this group did not act quite honestly is clear from the fact they only informed us of their establishment and their activities after they had already tried to win over the Brussels people, etc.
I regard the matter as closed, though we have not yet received an answer to our 'judgement' from Geneva.
The attempt has, in any case, failed.
b) Ad voceme Bakunin: To understand his enclosed letter,264 you must know the following: D'abord* this letter crossed our 'MESSAGE' regarding the 'Alliance'.
Bakunin is thus still under the pleasant misapprehen­ sion that he will be allowed to go his own way.
Further: The Russian Serno was, in his earlier correspondence with Borkheim, decidedly against Bakunin.
In my reply to Serno 84 I wished to use this young man as an informant about Bakunin.
Since I trust no Russian, I did it in this form: 'What is my old friend (/ don't know if he still is) Bakunin doing, etc.
, etc' The Russian Serno a 1.
All the articles of the Rules of the Alliance, etc.
, laying down its relations with the International Working Men's Association, are declared null and void.
2.
The Alliance, etc.
, is not admitted as a branch of the International Working Men's Association.

Marx to Engels.
13 January 1869 203 immediately informed Bakunin of this letter, and Bakunin used it for a sentimental entree.
c) Ad vocem OLD Becker: He has got himself badly stuck.
D'abord he sends us, dated Ge­ neva, 21 December, a 4-page letter about the Basle business, a but without a single fait précisa We should, however, act immediately.
At the same time, he writes to Lessner that we (the General Council) had already 'compromised' ourselves in the Geneva affair, and this should not happen again.
Or, he says in these precise words (in his letter to Lessner), 'does the General Council, like God, exist only in the faith of fools?' In Geneva, people only speak of us with a shrug of the shoulders, etc.
Thereupon Becker received the reply from Jung that his 4-page epistle contained nothing.
How can he expect to receive money in London on the basis of such a vacuum? In his letter of 21 December, Becker announced a further ELABORATE REPORT.
Instead of this we receive the Vorbote.
You saw for yourself that the Vorbote in fact only reported c on the 'concluded' LOCKOUT of the RIBBON WEAVERS,266 and certainly did not make clear how the conflict has developed since.
In short, TO THIS VERY MOMENT we know no more than is reported in Vorbote.
Not only can no step be taken with the TRADES UNIONS on this basis, but it is impossible to publish anything about the affair on behalf of the General Council.
We cannot expose ourselves to a reply from the usurers of Basle that we are shouting to the world without knowing the facts.
Summa summarum, a week ago the General Council decided to reprimand both Becker and Perret (the French correspondent for Geneva) for not providing us to date with the necessary information on the Basle affair.
The matter will rest there for the time being.
I'm sorry for OLD Becker.
But he must realise that we hold the reins, although we refrain from direct intervention as long as possible.
d) STRIKES IN ROUEN, VIENNE, ETC.
(COTTONSPINNING 2 2): Are ABOUT 6-7 WEEKS OLD.
The interesting thing about the case is that, some time ago, the MASTER-MANUFACTURERS (and SPINNERS) in Amiens held a GENERAL CONGRESS under the chairmanship of the maired of Amiens.
Here it was decided—on the suggestion of a certain faiseur" named Vidal, who had hung out in England for a considerable time—that competition should be offered to the English in England, etc.
Namely, by establishing depots for French a See this volume, pp.

, in England, both for sale there and to overseas merchants who trade directly with England.
And this should be brought about by a further reduction of WAGES, after it had already been admitted that, in France itself, assuming the present tariffs, English competition was only being withstood through the low WAGES (relative to the English ones).
In fact, after this Amiens congress, they began with wage reductions in Rouen, Vienne, etc.
HENCE the STRIKES.
We have let the people know, through Dupont, about the bad state of business here (especially also the COTTON TRADE), and thus the difficulty of raising money at this time.
MEANWHILE, as you will see from the enclosed letter (Vienne), the STRIKE in Vienne has come to an end.
For the present we have sent to those in Rouen, where the conflict is still going on, a draft for £20 on the Paris bronze-workers, who still owe us this money from their LOCKOUT.
18 Incidentally, these French workers act much more rationally than the Swiss and are, at the same time, much more modest in their demands.

Herr, etc.
Gimborn a has not presented himself.
According to your description, the fellow obviously wants nothing but to indulge in spying industrially.
The Bakunin group of both male and female sex (which difference Bakunin also wants to abolish, i.
e.
, that of the sexes) has probably quietly passed away.
The business was of Russian cunning, but still started stupidly; the fox tail showed too clearly and workers, in particular, cannot be caught in this way.
Old Beckerb simply cannot keep his fingers off 'organising', and was just the man to walk into the trap.
I am quite ready to believe that he commits other idiocies, but I wish we had a better source than Wilhelm,' who simply cannot see FACTS as they really are.
Apropos, Wilhelm has not sent me his sheet d any more since New Year; if he thinks I'm going to pay for it, he is making a big mistake.
I am really glad not to be instructed every week that we may not make a revolution until the Federal Diet, the blind Guelphe and the honorable Elector of Hessef are restored, and terrible and legitimate revenge wreaked upon Bismarck the godless.
The Basle story is very nice.
266 Altogether things are marching ahead well in Switzerland.
Of course, the affair is significant only because everything which is more or less suppressed on the rest of the Continent appears there in the light of day.
But that is in itself very good.
And direct legislation by the people makes sense there, because the direct or indirect domination of the bourgeoisie should be countered on the legislative councils.
276 Since the Swiss workers virtually did not exist as a political party of their own until the Geneva STRIKE,16 but were simply the tail of the radical bourgeoisie, they elected only radical bourgeois to the councils.
On the other hand, the elected peasants could also be managed easily a See this volume, p.

29 January 1869 by the educated bourgeois.
For small cantons, this may be quite satisfactory, but it naturally immediately becomes superfluous and a hindrance as soon as the proletariat enters the movement en masse and begins to dominate it.
A nice feature of the Basle strike is the contributions from Austria as far as Temesvâr.
It is inexcusable how old Becker has squandered this business with his wild declarations.
3 Have only glanced at the Vogt pamphlet, b seen that he has the horse descended from the flea.
If this is so, from whom is the jackass who wrote this pamphlet descended? Today I am sending you back the copies of Social-Demokrat, etc.
, together with some copies of Zukunft It is very good that there are still 50 copies of Herr Vogt with Kugelmann.
When Vogt lectures again in Berlin, Kugelmann must send some there, and advertise it in the newspapers.
I bet that will drive him away.
Sam Moore is now busily studying the first part of your Duncker,c and he understands it quite well.
He has completely grasped the dialectical stuff on money theory, etc.
, and declares it the best thing in the whole book, THEORETICALLY SPEAKING.
The business with good old Gottfried*1 is dragging on and on.
e If I can manage it somehow, I shall come to London next Thursday' evening and stay until Sunday evening.
The photograph gave great pleasured Gumpert has the Büchner h; I shall pick it up in the next few days; I fight shy of his wife, who is becoming increasingly philistine.
You must give it to the Lassalleans that they understand agitation in quite a different way from our good old Wilhelm and his boors of the People's Party.
" 77 This is very disagreeable, since they appear to outflank Wilhelm and Bebel completely, and the masses are so enormously stupid, and the leaders a bunch of blackguards.

Accordingly, I thought it necessary to write to Meissner, 84 to ask, as it were, for his authorisation for this (he does not like pamphlets).
He writes that nobody but he may print the pamphlet, since he is my publisher ex officio* and wishes to remain such.
The stuff should be sent to him direct, after minor alterations.

The news moved and shocked me deeply.
I had watched her, and all your children, growing up from the start more than the children of my other brothers and sisters, accordingly my attachment to her was livelier and warmer; I saw her last at her wedding, when she was so extremely happy and could look forward to a long succession of happy years; and now all this has come to an end.
What must be the feelings of you and Marien, b of poor Robert 0 with his two small children! For twenty years you and Marie have been so blessed by happiness, have had so little opportunity to taste the tragic face of life, that such a stroke out of a clear sky must hit you doubly hard.
In such cases words of consolation are no help; one must weep oneself dry like a child, till time heals the wounds.
I am not writing to console you, but only because I know that it is a comfort to receive expressions of sympathy from those from whom one may expect them.
And this sympathy and this compassion I send you, please believe me, with all my heart.
Greet Marie, poor Robert, and all your children most heartily from me.

First, the damned foggy weather here—NOTHING BUT MIST—has loaded me with a nearly four-week quite extraordinarily vicious influenza.
Second, I had the enclosed photogramsa taken at least 7 weeks ago but, as a result of this very weather and atmospheric darkness, the things could only be printed from the plate very recently.
The enclosed letter from A.
Rugeb has been received by my friend Strohn in Bradford, from one of his business friends.
Ruge obviously could not resist the 'negation of the negation'.
You must return the letter to me immediately, since Strohn must return it to the addressee.
The TREASURER of our GENERAL COUNCIL here — Cowell Stepney, a very rich and distinguished man, but completely devoted to the workers' cause, though in a somewhat eccentric way—enquired of a friend in Bonn about literature (German) on the labour question and socialism.
He sent him, en réponse, 0 a summary (written) made by Dr Held, Professor of Political Economy at Bonn.
His comments show the tremendous narrow-mindedness of these learned mandarins.
Writing about me and Engels, he (Held) states: 'Engels.
"The Condition of the Working Class" etc.
, the best product of German socialist-communist literature.
' 'Closely connected with Engels is Karl Marx.
He is the author of the most scientific and learned work which socialism as a whole has to show, Capital etc.
Although only recently published, this book is still an echo (!) of the movement before 1848.
That is why I mention it here in connection with Engels.
The work is, at the same time, (!) of great interest for the present since (!!) one may study here the source from which Lassalle drew his basic ideas.
' A nice place to find oneself! A lecturer of political economy at a German university writes to me that I have thoroughly convinced him, but—but his position enjoins him, 'like other colleagues', not to express his conviction.

He adds: If only half that which Kugelmann has done for Hanover had been done in a few larger places like Berlin, we should already have a second edition.

" So you will not be astonished at my passing over that stubborn fact—my prolonged silence.
I jump at once into médias res, h turning the back to the sins of the past.
In the first instance, I must frankly tell you that I feel much anxiety as to Laura's health.
Her prolonged sequestration I know not how to account for.

So soon as certain arrange­ ments permit, I shall come over for the single purpose of having a look at my child.
After the publication of The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, 0 I might not be quite safe at Paris.
Do not, in your letters, drop any hint as to my secret plan.
I feel much obliged to little Fouchtrae who tries his best at keeping his Grandfather up in the literature of the day.

15 February 1869 217 is the portrait of Blanqui which I have sent to Beesly, to cure him of the strange prejudices he has imbibed in the book of that vieille cocotte, Daniel Stern.
a When we had him at dinner, he naively asked me whether Blanqui was not one of those irrespectable men, like Bradlaugh.
I could not but chuckle in my sleeves at this truly John Bullian appreciation of revolutionary characters.
I asked him, whether his hero, Catiline, b had been a 'respectable' man? The thing that amuses me most in Le Peuple is the cir­ cumstance—a good sample of historical irony—that these learned Proudhonians are forced to come out as gens de lettre, c a part which they despise so much, and which, nevertheless, is their only true rôle, the only thing they are fit for.
As to Paul's lively narration of his adventure with Mile Royer, 282 it has tickled Engels and my humble self.
I was not at all astonished at his failure.
He will remember that, having read her preface to Darwin, d I told him at once she was a bourgeois.
Darwin was led by the struggle for life in English society—the competition of all with all, bellum omnium contra omnes e—to discover competi-' tion to [.
.
.
] as the ruling law of 'bestial' and vegetative life.
The Darwinism/ conversely, considers this a conclusive reason for human society never to emancipate itself from its bestiality.
As to La Misere de la Philosophie, I do really not see what I can further do in this affair.
The mass has been spoilt from the beginning.
The books ought to have been thankfully received at once, but it is now too late to mend.
I have written to Meissner 84 to look after Vogler, but we will hardly gain anything by finding out that vagabond.
The worst is that Vieweg not only keeps, but sequestrates the book.
If he advertises it anew, at 2 fcs per piece, he might sell it—perhaps.
Lafargue ought to speak with him in that sense.
204 I fear I cannot do much for the new paper contemplated.
283 At all events, I shall try my best.
Cowell Stepney will never advance £12,000.
He is a well-meaning fool who fritters away his means in a most grotesque way.

15 February 1869 come out on a larger scale, he has neither the will nor the power to do so.
Our International makes great strides in Germany.
Our new plan, proposed by myself, to allow only individual membership, and sell at Id the cards, on whose back our principles are printed in German, French and English—works well.
Jung becomes every day more and more a little master.
The unction, affectation, and self-importance with which he drops his golden words and spins his long narrative yarn, grow really insupportable.
So Dupont told him, adding that he (Jung) was even given, while speaking, to the habitude of putting his hands in his pockets and making jingle his purse.
But he is really not so bad as that.
The old acquaintance of mine—the Russian Bakunin—had started a little nice conspiracy against the International.
Having fallen out with and seceded from, the Ligue de la Paix et de la Liberté, on their last Berne Congress, 284 he entered the Romande Section of our Association at Geneva.
He very soon inveigled brave old Becker, 3 always anxious for action, for something stirring, but of no very critical cast of mind, an enthusiast like Garibaldi, easily led away.
Well, Bakunin hatched the plan of L'Alliance Internationale de la Démocratie Socialiste, which was to form at the same time a branch of our International, and a new independent International Association 'with the special mission to elaborate the higher philosophical etc.
principles' b of the pro­ letarian movement, and, in point of fact, would, by a clever trick, have placed our society under the guidance and supreme initiative of the Russian Bakunin.
The way in which they set to business, was quite characteristic.
They sent their new programme,257 with old Becker's name at the head of the signatures—and they sent emissaries too—behind our back, to Paris, Brussels, etc.
Only in the last moment, they communicated the documents to the London General Council.
By a formal judgmentc we annulled and stifled the Muscovite nursling.
All our branches approved the decision.
Of course, old Becker bears me now a grudge (and so does Schily on his account), but with all my personal friendship for Becker I could not allow this first attempt at disorganising our society to succeed.

You see that the main strong passages, which he quoted to us in Russian, only exist in his imagination.
Still, the Pan-Slavism is really spread rather too thickly, in particular the threats against the Poles are significant.
And the dissolution of the Russian Empire is qualified by the fact that Great Russia should still become the centre of the Slav confederation.

281 It is transparently clear.
I have changed nothing, except to strike out the final sentence (or rather some words of it).
Yesterday read out in the Central Council.
73 Adopted.
Will be sent first to The Times (or rather taken there by Eccarius).
If they don't take it, then to The Daily News.
Then the English press cutting will be sent to Zukunft, Social-Demokrat and Wilhelm* The POOR DEVILS of Lugau will have the great satisfaction of being mentioned in the English press.
Enclosed RESOLUTIONS* etc.
, 6 in all.
The circumstances are as follows.
The resolution of the Congress (Brussels)138 obliged us to have the Brussels .
resolutions printed.
226 Using the excuse that the Geneva resolutions form part of the PLATFORM, we have printed, at the same time, part of what was tabled at the Geneva congress 143 by the London Central Council and adopted by the Geneva a i.

Resolutions of the Congress of Geneva, 1866, and the Congress of Brussels, 1868 congress, omitting the amendments, etc.
, proposed by the French in Geneva and also adopted—rubbishy stuff.
Thus, this portion is written by me.
On the other hand, I had no part in drafting the 1868 RESOLUTIONS.
The only phrase from me verbatim is the FIRST CONSIDERING 'ON THE EFFECTS OF MACHINERY'.
3 That Bakunin should lay claim to the 'Slav' brothers in Courland and Livonia is great.
Neither are his CLAIMS ON Silesia bad.

I hope the English press will take the report,281 but I am firmly convinced that it will not, and that, in the last resort, only The Bee-Hive will remain.
At best the fellows will make huge cuts.
I have not yet read the resolutions.
226 But at first glance one is surprised that the 1867 Lausanne resolutions are not reprinted also.
NB.
about the money: I only had the choice of sending it through Borkheim or else in some other way, which would cause gossip here in the office; I preferred the lesser evil.
In future this will naturally not happen again.
The final sentence in the report2 was, of course, aimed only at Liebknecht's sheetb and the public.
Foster ON EXCHANGES is being sent to you today by GLOBE PARCEL EXPRESS, since the BOOKPOST is not certain enough for an irreplaceable book.
If you have not received it by Saturday0 morning, you must immediately complain to GLOBE PARCEL EXPRESS, 150 Cheapside or 150 Leadenhall STREET.
Best you should return it the same way.
Even by MAIL TRAIN, the GLOBE is much the cheapest way to send larger consignments of books.
Regarding the copies, I would immediately haul Wilhelm over the coals, and categorically demand information.
The same with Meissner.
The fellow has obviously had second thoughts, but since Eichhoff is ready to print, he must decide oui ou non.
d Nothing but rain here.
Apropos, I have written to Borkheim about Bakunin 84 that he should raise the question as to whether it is in any way possible for us Westerners to cooperate with this Pan-Slav pack while the fellows preach their Slav supremacy; he will probably read this to you tomorrow285 when you collect the money—but, in addition, I told him he should discuss the matter with you.

Paid out by Borkheim on Saturday.
" He read me your letter 84 and then his answer.
He is very proud supposedly to have been able to prove that you muddle up genders (which apparently often happens with you).
Ditto received Foster on Saturday evening.
The book is indeed important for its time.
First, because Ricardo's theory is fully developed in it, and better than in Ricardo —on money, rate of exchange, etc.
b Second, because you can see here how those jackasses, BANK OF ENGLAND, COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY,287 the theo­ reticians racked their brains over the problem: ENGLAND DEBTOR TO IRELAND.
Despite the fact that the rate of exchange is always against Ireland, and money is exported from Ireland to England.
Foster solves the puzzle for them: it is the depreciation of Irish paper money.
In fact, two years earlier than him (1802), Blake had fully explained this difference between the nominal and the real rate of exchange, about which, incidentally, Petty288 had said everything necessary—but after him this business was forgotten once again.
The Irish amnesty289 is the paltriest of its kind ever seen.
D'abord,c most of those amnestied had almost served the term after which all PENAL SERVITUDE MEN are released on TICKETS OF LEAVE.
And second, the chief ringleaders have been kept inside 'because' Fenianism86 is of 'American' origin, and thus all the more criminal.
It is precisely for this reason that YANKEE-IRISHMEN like Costello are released and the ANGLO-IRISH are kept under lock and key.

Lafargue has been excused 3 of the 5 examinations (French), and received permission, or rather instructions, to take the 2 remaining ones in Strasbourg.
Meanwhile, he appears to me to be too absorbed in POLITICS, which can become nasty, since his friends are a lot of Blanquists.

As a comparative philologist, you may find forms of interest to you in the following extract from an early 16tha-century Scottish chronicle292 about the death of the DUKE OF Rothesay (son OF KING Robert III): 'Be quhais deith, succedit gret displeseir to hir son, David Duk of Rothesay: for, during hir life, he wes haldin in virtews and honest occupatioun: eftir hir deith' (namely Queen Annabella) 'he began to rage in all maner of insolence: and fulyeit virginis, matronis, and nunnis, be his unbridillit lust.
At last, King Robert, informit of his young and insolent maneris, send letteris to his brothir, the Duk of Albany, to intertene his said son, the Duk of Rothesay, and to leir him honest and civill maneris.
The Duk of Albany, glaid of thir writtingis, tuk the Duk of Rothesay betwix Dunde and Sanct Androis, and brocht him to Falkland, and inclusit him in the tour theirof, but ony meit or drink.
It is said, ane woman, havand commiseratioun on this Duk, Ieit meill fall daun throw the loftis of the toure: be quhilkis, his life wes certane dayis savit.
This woman, fra it wes knawin, wes put to deith.
On the same maner, ane othir woman gaif him milk of hir paup, throw ane lang reid; and wes slane with gret cruelte, fra it wes knawin.
Than wes the Duk destitute of all mortall supplie; and brocht, finalie, to sa miserable and hungry appetite, that he eit, nocht allanerlie the filth of the toure quhare he wes, bot his awin fingaris: to his gret marterdome.
His body wes beryit in Lundonis, and kithit miraklis mony yeris eftir; quhil, at last, King James the First began to punis his slayaris: and fra that time furth, the miraklis ceissit.

3 March 1869 162 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER London, 3 March 1869 DEAR FRED, herum Crispinus!* Our valued Wilhelm b has his own PROCEEDINGS.
First, he reprints from the Revue der Neuen Rheinischen Zeitung Eccarius' article about 'Tailoring in London', c without asking Eccarius and without quoting the Revue as his source.
Then he writes to Eccarius that he would like to print the article as a pamphlet.
Therewith Eccarius replies that, in this case, a 2nd CHAPTER is necessary, since the conditions have changed completely over the last 19 years, something that Wilhelm had absolutely overlooked in his copying craze.
Then a second move by Wilhelm: He writes to Eccarius: he should send him the issue of the Revue containing your article on the 'German Peasant War'.
So Wilhelm wanted to reprint your article without your prior knowledge and once again without citing the Revue.
Luckily, Eccarius informed me yesterday evening at the Central Council.
I told him I would write to you about the case and, in the meantime, Eccarius should send him nothing.
With regards to the stuff itself, I have a SPARE COPY I could send to Wilhelm.
And I believe—even supposing we should later publish our assorted articles together—that publication in Wilhelm's sheet would do us no harm and the immediate effect of the publication would be very good.
But, UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, Wilhelm should not be allowed to publish the article as an original contribution for him, instead of as a reprint from the Revue.
Write me without delay your arbitrium.
6 Another curiosity.

3 March 1869 enquires about you and the lois de sûreté 293 are still in force.
Let Lafargue go to Strasbourg as soon as possible and take his examinations; once that is over, he will be able to take some liberties.
The fact that he has emancipated himself from Moilin is of enormous value; this Jesuit would certainly have got him into trouble.
What Lafargue writes about Blanqui is very nice.
a Moore tells me that Beesly has written an article on the social question in the new Fortnightly which reaches the maximum confusion.
b The only thing linguistically new for me in the old Scottish passage292 was the participium praesentis havand, having,—showing that this form still existed in Scotland at the beginning of the 16thc century, when it had long disappeared in England.

But with his People's Party 38 and his mania for restoring thrones, he'll have no success in dangling carrots before north German workers.
The odd thing is that he suddenly wants to go to Berlin, that is to say, admits that he can, without danger.
Incidentally, I cannot see how you, as the GENERAL COUNCIL, could declare yourselves competent on this question—even if both parties agreed—unless they both also declared themselves willing to subject themselves to the arbitration verdict against the organisation and management of the TRADES UNIONS, etc.

Quételet is now too old for one still to make any sort of experiment with him.
296 He rendered great services in the past by demonstrating that even the apparently casual incidents of social life possess an inner necessity through their periodic recurrence and their periodic average incidence.
But he was never successful in interpreting this necessity.
297 And he made no progress, but simply extended the material for his observations and calculations.
He is today no further on than he was before 1830.

41 Then—with the manuscript—I shall come to Germany with my daughter" and see you then.
Or, to be more precise, shall descend on you.
In France—a very interesting movement in progress.
The Parisians are once again really studying their recent revolutionary past, to prepare themselves for the pending new revolutionary business.
First, the origin of the Empire—then the coup d'état of December.
This had been entirely forgotten, just as the reaction in Germany has been able to wipe out memories of 1848/49 completely.
That is why Ténot's books about the coup d'état in Paris and the provinces b aroused such enormous interest that they rapidly went through 10 editions.
They were followed by dozens of other books on the same period.
C'était la rage, c and this soon became a speculative business for the publishers.
These writings came from the opposition— Ténot is an homme du Siècle (I mean the liberal bourgeois paper, not our century).
All the liberal and illiberal rogues belonging to the official opposition promoted this mouvement Also the republican democrats, people like Delescluze, for example, who was formerly Ledru-Rollin's adjutant and now, as republican patriarch, edits Réveil in Paris.
Until now everybody has been indulging in these posthumous revelations, or rather reminiscences—everybody who was not Bonapartist.
But then came le revers de la médaillée First, the French Government itself got the renegade Hippolyte Castille to publish Les Massacres de Juin 1848.
This was a blow in the face for Thiers, Falloux, Marie, Jules Favre, Jules Simon, Pelletan, etc.
, in short, the chiefs of what is called in France 'l'Union Libérale', 298 who wish to perform a sleight of hand with the next elections, the infamous old rogues.

Last came the Blanquists, for example, G.
Tridon: Gironde et Girondins.
So the whole historic witches' brew is simmering.
When shall we have got this far? To show you how well the French police are served: I intended to go to Paris next week to see my daughter.

He had a commission for him.

0 For my part, I do not think that the article would have any sort of effect in Liebknecht's paperc in instalments of 1 or 2 columns, since it would thus be spread over two years.
On the other hand, if he wanted to print it cheaply for the workers, this would be different and could have an impact.
Since he is now involved in a row with Schweitzer,294 I would suggest to him that he publish the last section of my pamphlet on military questions d in his sheet, or ask Meissner the price at which he would allow him to sell the remainder (he once asked me about this through Moore, but as I have had no occasion to write to him since, this too has remained unanswered).

299 You must send it back as soon as you have read it, since I have to lay it before the COUNCIL on TUESDAY NEXT.
3 The gentlemen of the 'Alliance' have taken a long time to produce this opus.
In fact, we would rather they had kept their 'unnumbered legions' in France, Spain and Italy to themselves.
Bakunin thinks: if we approve his "programme radical' he can trumpet it forth and compromise us tant soit peu.
h If we declare ourselves against it, we shall be denounced as counter­ revolutionaries.
Moreover: If we admit it, he will see to it that, at the Congress in Basle, he is seconded by some RIFF-RAFF.
I think the answer should be along the following LINES: 300 According to para.
1 of the Rules, every workers' society that is 'AIMING AT THE SAME END; VIZ.
, THE PROTECTION, ADVANCEMENT AND COMPLETE EMANCIPATION OF THE WORKING CLASSES' , is to be admitted.

Marx to Engels.
5 March 1869 The community of action the International Working Men's Association is calling into being, the exchange of ideas by means of the different organs of the sections in all countries and, finally, the direct discussions at the general congresses would also gradually create a common theoretical programme for the general workers' movement.
With regard to the programme of the 'Alliance', therefore, it is not necessary for the General Council to submit it to an examen critique.
11 The Council does not need to examine whether it is an adequate scientific expression of the workers' movement.
It has only to ask whether the general tendency of the programme is in opposition to the general tendency of the International Working Men's Association—the COMPLETE EMANCIPATION OF THE WORKING CLASSES! This reproach might apply to only one phrase in the program­ me, para.
2: 'elle veut avant tout l'égalisation politique, économi­ que et sociale des classes.
h 'L'égalisation des classes', interpreted literally, is simply another way of saying the 'Harmonie du capital et du travail' 0 preached by bourgeois socialists.
The final aim of the International Working Men's Association is not the logically impossible 'égalisation des classes', but the historically necessary 'abolition des classes'.
From the context in which this phrase appears in the programme, however, it seems to be merely A SLIP OF THE PEN.
The General Council has little doubt, therefore, that this phrase, which might lead to serious misunderstanding, will be deleted from the programme.
301 On this assumption, it is the principle of the International Working Men's Association to leave each section the responsibility for its own programme.
There is, therefore, no obstacle to the transformation of the sections of the Alliance into sections of the International Working Men's Association.
As soon as this has taken place, the General Council must, in accordance with the Rules, be supplied with a dénombrement of the newly adhering sections, according to country, residence and numbers.
This last point—the census of their legions—will, of course, upset the gentlemen.
When you return the letter, tell me what you want changed in this draft reply.

Even in their own sommation* the fellows do not dare to call upon you to make the programme your own; they simply wish indirectly to induce you to make a theoretical criticism.
A stupid Russian trap into which people in this country will surely not fall.
Apart from this, the people's retreat is complete, and nothing more could be desired.
The about-face by which the fellows are being compelled to allow you to review their forces is very amusing, and will act like a bucket of cold water over their phrase-mongering heads.

printing it as a popular, cheap pamphlet, there will still be time with Eichhoff.
You will have to write to him about The 18th Brumaire, which you could do at the same time.
If Meissner does not get on with The 18th Brumaire, or is scared, then steps must be taken and the thing given to Eichhoff.

I discovered a copy of The 18th Brumaire at Charles', b and immediately confiscated it.
I read it through again and immediate­ ly saw that the book must appear in French without delay.
303 That will have quite a different effect from just German, and will immediately make you a name amongst the French, which will at once ensure the translation of your book.
c See who you might get to do this and, in any case, take steps along these LINES.
Printed in Brussels, it would get to France en masse.
Before the Peasant War is sent off, send me the copy so that I can correct the misprints, see whether a preface, etc.

It would be good to avoid an unnecessary squabble with Oberwinder; Wilhelm will have to inform us of the relations between these two and what Angerstein, who was also recommended by him, is now doing.

14 March 1869 democratic gentlemen and should not, for the time being, indulge in such pursuits as TRADES UNIONS.
If these gentlemen are such hot-headed friends of direct revolutionary action, why don't they set the example, instead of writing careful and reserved articles for Zukunft I Do they expect such stuff to awaken revolutionary passion? That won't catch anybody! The reply to the Genevans3 has been sent off.
In the French text I kept the tone still icier and passablement ironique}* Luckily, this was not noticed by the English, who naturally only know my English translation.
Apart from the official communication299 about which I told you, the gentlemen also sent a 4-page private letter to Eccarius, according to which a direct breach had only been avoided thanks to the EFFORTS of Becker, Bakunin, and Perret, author of the document.
Their 'revolutionary' programme had had more effect in some weeks in Italy, Spain, etc.
, than that of the International Working Men's Association had in years.
If we should reject their 'revolutionary programme', we would [produce] a separation between the countries with a 'revolutionary' workers' movement (these are listed as France, where they have all of 2 correspondents, Switzerland(!), Italy—where the workers, apart from those who belong to us, are simply a tail to Mazzini—and Spain, where there are more clerics than workers) and those with a more gradual development of the working class (viz.
, England, Germany, the United States and Belgium).
Thus, a separation between the volcanic and plutonic workers' movement on the one hand, and the AQUEOUS movement on the other.
That the Swiss should represent the revolutionary type is really amusing.
Old Becker must have become very stupid if he really believes that Bakunin has invented a 'programme'.

b On the other hand, you have to grant the Lassalleans that they are developing quite a different sort of activity and know how to make ten times more out of the limited means than the People's Party does.
38 Even when Schweitzer was imprisoned, the Social-Demokrat did not publish such idiocies as Wilhelm does.
I wonder what Wilhelm will say about the fact that, in Celle the Hanoverian particularists, defeated in the first round of polling, voted in the second round for Planck, the National-Liberal Bismarckian, and thus got him into the Reichstag instead OF Yorck, the worker.
But that does not matter to Wilhelm.
Huxley's famous article in the Fortnightly24* in fact contains almost nothing except the joke about Comtism.
The Comtists are said to be very furious about this, and intend to publish a thunderous reply, as a geological friendc in London writes to Moore.
What do you think of my suggestion about printing the articles from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung 307 before Bonaparte? And about the French version? d Many thanks for the Castille.

20 March 1869 243 172 MARX TO ENGELS 56 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 20 March 1869 DEAR FRED, We all hope that, in your next letter, you will be sending us better news about MRS Lizzie's state of health.
Tussy especially asks you to extend our deepest sympathy to her.
It's damned awful weather.
Jennychen can't get rid of her cold, and for the past few days I have been cold-wild and cough-confused.
Next week (Friday or Saturday3) the children are going to Paris to the Lafargues.
The business with Laura was this: she had a fall 2 or 3 weeks before her accouchement.
As a result of this fall, she had to keep to her bed until 1-2 weeks ago and only with difficulty avoided danger.
I intend to have myself naturalised as an Englishman,308 so I can travel to Paris safely.
Without such a journey the French edition of my book309 will never materialise.
My presence there is absolutely necessary.
Under Pahnerston's law you can, if you wish, slough off the Englishman again after 6 months.
The law provides no protection for the naturalised person with regard to illegalities committed in his country of birth before naturalisation, if he should return to that country.
With this exception, a naturalised person is on the same footing as any Englishman vis-à-vis foreign GOVERNMENTS.
I really cannot see why I should not visit Paris without the permission of M.
Bonaparte, if I have the means to do so.
My best thanks to Schorlemmer for the 2ND EDITION of Chemie.
h Tomorrow, as a Sunday recreation, I shall start re-reading the 2nd part, the organic chemistry (and assume that this is where the changes are to be sought).
As regards Louis Bonaparte, I am not inv favour of printing the series from the Revue up to 1850 as an introductionc .
On the one hand, I don't wish to give Meissner new excuses for delay.
On the other, it would be very easy, by patching in FACTS that emerged later, to revise this section, but there is no hurry.

20 March 1869 Paepe has sought in vain for a French publisher for Louis Bonaparte.
For such operations, these gentlemen demand money from the author.
Blanqui, who is now in Paris, made very good jokes at Lafargue's about Moilin's3 real QUACK NOSTRUM.
France, he said, is always ungrateful to its great men.
Moilin, for instance, has solved the problem of the century in an unprecedentedly simple manner — and Paris goes about its business as though nothing had happened.
Castille was a June insurgent, was transported as such to Cayenne, and returned after the general amnesty.
He wrote the first edition of his bookb de bonne foi.
c In the meantime, the government bought him, and staged this second edition as the antithesis to Ténot's writings.
The changes made are: 1.
the tone has become more bourgeois, sometimes smart-alecky.
2.
Passages against the men of Decemberd have been removed.
3.
A few quietly apologetic phrases for Bonaparte have been patched in.
Despite all this, the fonds" unchanged, and it remains as you say, a very satisfactory work.
It is a very good thing when M.
Bonaparte pushes back the writing of history to the period before 2 December.
The struggle of the various parties, their mutual: Et tu Brute! 1 will help put a stop to the 'revolutionism' of the old scoundrels of 1848 and earlier.
I sent to Beesly, by city post, WITH A FEW RANDOM NOTES for him to read, Vermorel's pamphlet8 that I also sent you (with the Castille).
He sent it back to me with the enclosed note, which is as stupid as it is MAGISTERIAL and arrogant.
It appears to me that positive philosophy may be equated with ignorance about everything positive.
The other sheet enclosed was sent me by Borkheim for my 'DUTCH RELATIONS'.
11 Yesterday I found the report on the 'miners' guilds',1 printed in full in the Social-Demokrat of last Wednesday.
Whether the Zukunft has taken it I do not know.
281 Possibly the report does not stand at that lofty stage of wisdom that alone can satisfy social policy.

She is getting up again today for the first time.
Through a remarkable piece of DIVINATION, I diagnosed pleurisy for Gumpert on Sunday,c he examined her, found nothing, declared it was bronchitis (which was also present), in addition to catarrh in the lungs, and it was naturally rather annoying for him when the pleurisy declared itself after all.
I naturally do not claim that it was present when he could not find it.

Engels to Marx.
21 March 1869 childbed is no joke, and it is good that it is over.
When they get there, Tussy and Jenny must give her and Lafargue too my hearty greetings.
The explanation about Castille was very useful to me.
The wisdom of Solomon Beesly returned herewith.
3 It is the greatest nonsense.
In time, this Comtism will confirm an even stronger version of that remark made by that man from Bonn about the Hegelians: they do not need to know about anything in order to write about everything.
In Germany the conversion of the natural forces, for instance, heat into mechanical energy, etc.
, has given rise to a very absurd theory, which incidentally follows with a certain inevitability from Laplace's old hypothesis, but is now displayed, as it were, with mathematical proofs: that the world is becoming steadily colder, that the temperature in the universe is levelling down and that, in the end, a moment will come when all life will be impossible and the entire world will consist of frozen spheres rotating round one another.
I am simply waiting for the moment when the clerics seize upon this theory as the last word in materialism.
It is impossible to imagine anything more stupid.
Since, according to this theory, in the existing world, more heat must always be converted into other energy than can be obtained by converting other energy into heat, so the original hot state, out of which things have cooled, is obviously inexplicable, even contradictory, and thus presumes a god.
Newton's first impulse is thus converted into a first heating.
Nevertheless, the theory is regarded as the finest and highest perfection of materialism; these gentlemen prefer to construct a world that begins in nonsense and ends in nonsense, instead of regarding these nonsensical consequences as proof that what they call natural law is, to date, only half-known to them.
But this theory is all the dreadful rage in Germany.
I've not yet seen the Zukunft.

I paid Lucraft last Tuesday.
3 Have you seen the short report about the demonstration in The Times OF SATURDAY LAST b? It states that a German group ('of our people!') carried a red flag inscribed Proletarier aller Länder, verunreiniget Euch!, which they said in English, means 'RAGAMUFFINS OF ALL REGIONS, BEFOUL YOURSELVES!' As you correctly assume, I am cold-maddened and cold-stupefied.
The children left on Friday' evening (to the horror of the English, on GOOD FRIDAY).
We received a letter from them this morning.
They arrived safely in Paris, but had a stormy crossing.
I am not yet a FREEBORN BRITON.
One resists such a step as long as one can.
308 Nothing could be more gallant than the way Wilhelm the Honourable is extracting himself from the affair of the Vogt copies/ At my INSTIGATION, Kugelmann wrote to him about it.
No reply to the first letter, and to another letter he received the enclosed screed, which may be summed up as follows: If I (Liebknecht) announced [the despatch of] 60 copies, but only 6 arrived, you should be aware that J always lie, so there the matter must rest.
If, however, C.
Hirsch of Berlin advised you of the number (he naturally does not know that I advised Kugelmann), it is a different matter and must be investigated.
The sort of artful dodges the fellow gets up to is displayed in a letter from Hirsch to Kugelmann.
Hirsch writes to Kugelmann 310: 'Liebknecht probably hopes for nothing more than that you should circulate the books IN QUESTION in Hanover, in order to enlighten the Democratic Party there about the doings of Herr Vogt, etc' Thus Wilhelm kept it secret from Hirsch that / had demanded information about the state of affairs, and an assured place for storing those copies still available.

.
' 'But it seems to me, as well, that the rabbi and the monk, both of them to heaven smell' 3 With regard to this clash of words, I received (today) the enclosed letter from Bebel.
sn Since the 60-copy letter,84 Wilhelm himself does not dare write to me—until more water has flowed under the bridge.
They are amazing fellows! First they wilfully get themselves into a situation where they are bound to get a drubbing.
Then I am supposed to intervene as deus ex machina and elegantly reject Schweitzer's resolution on the acceptance of the programme of the International, should Schweitzer's general meeting pass it! 312 And all this after Wilhelm and Co.
have not taken one single step about the International since the Nuremberg Congress, 135 have done absolutely nothing so that those poor devils in Lugau found it necessary to turn directly to London.
b I believe Bebel to be useful and able.
He only had the particular misfortune to find his 'theoretician' in Mr Wilhelm.
Something else demonstrates the fellows' carelessness and sloppiness: to date they have not informed me of a single FACT to prove the charges of high treason, etc.
, levelled against Schweitzer.
Fine businessmen.
Lloyd's Paper, in the Sunday number a week ago,c carried long hymns of praise about our RESOLUTIONS and the INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION in general.
I have received a letter from Dietzgen, who is a prosperous tanner in Siegburg.
313 I shall send it to you as soon as it is answered.
Dietzgen's ideas will be published by Meissner, for whom he has guaranteed the printing costs, under the title: Die Kopfarbeit, dargestellt von einem Handarbeiter usw.

4 April 1869 178 ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH LESSNER IN LONDON Manchester, 4 April 1869 86 Mornington Street Dear Lessner, I was very pleased to have word from you, and enclose the photograph requested.
The Becker story3 together with other material I expressly placed ready a week ago, in order to send it to Marx, but the womenfolk put the stuff somewhere else each morning, so I forgot it day after day.
Tomorrow I shall take the package into town, and send Becker directly to you.
The compliments you have so undeservedly paid me shame me all the more since, unfortunately, in the last 18 years, I have been able to do as good as nothing directly for our cause, and have had to devote all my time to bourgeois activities.
I hope this will soon change, I expect in a few months once again to be master of my time, and I shall then surely do my part to earn your compliments; it will always be a pleasure for me to bash the same enemy on the same battlefield together with an old comrade like you.
You are right; the cause goes better than ever before; years ago, at a time when the stupid democratic mob complained about reaction and the people's indifference to them, we, Moor and I, were right in foreseeing in the period of this reaction the enormous industrial development of the last 18 years and declared this would result in a sharpening of the contradictions between labour and capital, and more acute class struggle.
It would make a donkey laugh to see how these stupid democrats have now really been duped, so that there is not even a decent little place for them in any other corner of the world.
The Party of Progress in Germany,317 republicans in France, radicals in England, all of them equally rotten.
There is nothing funnier than the sweet-sour compliments they have to make to the social movement, though they know full well that, one fine day, this social movement will have its foot on their necks.

Tussy will stay in Paris for at least 2 months.
As you will note from the enclosed letter, she is absolutely delighted with Fouschtra,d the YOUNGSTER of the Lafargue FAMILY.
The Wilhelm-Bebel-Schweitzer clash of words has not really been so bad; after all, when of 11,000 voters, 4,500 abstained from voting for Schweitzer, this was not exactly a triumph for this gentleman.
318 With regard to the Citizen ^ the contributors to which include Dr Engel of Berlin and Dr Brentano of the same, this appears to be stillborn or, as OLD Werner says, 'laid out'.
Lloyd Jones is an old tailor by trade, who figured in a STRIKE back in 1824.
For a long time now he has been an apostle of cooperation, and a lazy-bones.
Odger and Applegarth are both possessed by a mania for mediation and a longing for respectability.
On the CENTRAL COUNCIL, we ticked off Mr Applegarth properly.
319 With regard to Odger's collaboration in particular, it never went further than the prospectus, and here people simply laugh at such PROMISSORY BILLS on his part.

But to drag in the International so directly, as Becker b and Co.
are doing, without preparation, without thinking about a war-chest, without taking into consideration the good or bad state of business in Europe — this is simply compromising.

6 April 1869 255 180 ENGELS TO MARX 124 IN LONDON Manchester, 6 April 1869 Dear Moor, Liebknecht has again had the good luck of fools.
The vote of 6,500 against 4,500 was a tremendous defeat for Schweitzer, 318 even if it was not a direct victory for Wilhelm.
The Kölner Zeitung says that Schweitzer was frightfully dismayed, and though he had declared earlier that he would resign if any sort of considerable minority were to vote against him, he has taken a lot of care not to do so.
322 In any case, Schweitzer's campaign for the kingdom of the tailors has failed, and his position in his own association has been shaken severely.
N'est pas dictateur qui veut.
" The process of the disintegration of specific Lassalleanism has thus begun, and is bound to continue rapidly.
The figures 6,500:4,500 mean either a split or abandonment of the 'strict' organisation and Schweitzer's personal leadership.
So far Liebknecht's foolhardiness has had a good effect.
And under these circumstances I shall not take it amiss that he has let himself in for a new armistice, 323 although this is the third case between the two of them of 'cad's fighting, when ended, is very soon mended'.
The copies of Zukunft follow enclosed.
Unfortunately, the Reichstag debate on industrial legislation is very poorly reported in them.
There is nothing more comical than Schweitzer's lecture on the socialist demands, culminating in the declaration that he favours trades freedom b up to Wagener, Miquel et Co.

7 April 1869 257 facts.
Anybody who regards facts as important, who 'takes them into consideration', is someone who idolises success, a Bismarckian.
So even if Schweitzer's 'dirty deeds' were as cheap as blackberries, he would not give us any facts about them, since, according to the principles of the People's Party,38 the only important thing about all these facts is that Wilhelm declares them to be 'dirty deeds'.
It follows that, as Schweitzer's dirty deeds become enormous, the friction with him disappears.
The fellow's logic is as amusing as the anticipation with which he still hopes for a proclamation from you, declaring him to be the angel of light, and naming Schweitzer as Satan.
It is also amusing that he wants to sell an essay3 of at least 4 or 5 printer's sheets for 1 '/2 groschen, and emphasises: not at a profit.
'Le représentant a dit: avec du fer et du pain on va jusqu'en Chine.
Il n'a pas parlé de chaussures.
' h And Wilhelm has not mentioned who will meet the loss when you sell things at '/s to 'A of cost price.
I have not yet written to Meissner, and I really cannot expect him to do the wondrous things that Liebknecht boldly ventures.
Once Wilhelm has spoken with an expert about the printing costs, determined a rational price and made sure that he can raise the printing costs, I am not disinclined to let him print the stuff; tell him to write to me as soon as he can fulfil these conditions, then we shall arrange further steps.
Snieuntojown is sun-jovn-to-jovn — sun-eve-to-eve.

The Bazleyite agitation in favour of state aid for cotton cultivation has not yet become so public here that there has been anything substantial in the newspapers.
However, I shall soon send you some cuttings about the STRIKE in Preston,326 which the MASTERS directly provoked in order to bring about a general shut-down of the factories there.
Since they cannot agree amongst themselves on SHORT TIME or complete closure, as some would then go on working and the others would be vexed at this, the sole form to bring about joint action amongst them is a STRIKE, since no manufacturer opposes the proposal to reduce wages.
The cream of the thing is that these fellows, who admit that, for 2 years, they have been losing 1 to 2d.

10 April 1869 259 The enclosed letter327 shows the frame of mind of the workers in the Rhine province about the Barmen-Elberfeld Congress.
Schweitzer had forgotten that Robespierre did not answer accusations only when he was sure of his cause, or when he could answer with the guillotine.
But the CORRUPTIBLE should not take the INCORRUPTIBLE as their model.

Dear Sir, Being aware of your services to the working class, I should before this have given myself the pleasure of sending you my last work: Das Kapital (2nd and 3d volumes not yet published 41), if I had known you to be a German reader.
In your article on Lassalle in the Fortnightly" you say first that Lassalle propagated my principles in Germany and say then that I am propagating 'Lassallean principles' in England.
This would indeed be what the French call 'un échange de bons procédés'.
h In the volume I send you, you will find (Preface, p.
VIII, note 1) the plain facts stated viz.
that 'Lassalle has taken from my writings almost literally all his general theoretical developments', but that I 'have nothing whatever to do with his practical applications'.

It belongs in fact to, and was zealously preached, at the time of Louis Philippe, by Monsieur Bûchez, Ex-St.

Bûchez put forward his views, f.

Since you quote my reply to Proudhon: Misère de la Philosophie, you cannot but be aware from its last chapter that in 1847, when all the political economists and all the socialists concurred on one single point—the condemnation of trades' unions, I demonstrated their historical necessity.

The one in Solingen was already there, 330 and the Solingen people established the one in Bourscheid.

14 April 1869 261 whether this dispatch is published in one of the official publica­ tions, which is not easy to believe (unless a Greek book), or whether it found its way into Urquhart's hands along private channels.
It would be interesting to know this, in case it is quoted later.
The statement coincides completely with my constant claim that Russia will not unleash a war before 2 railways are completed to the Black Sea and the Pruth.
They are now building like mad, and borrowing money like crazy—in the past 3 years—about £47,000,000! A major part of this represents the future costs of war.
However, in the light of these negotiations, Beust appears to be the Austrian Palmerston, and here too there could be a motive that would favour a speed-up of the action.
Doesn't Eichhoff still send you the Social-Demokrat'? It would be very important to see how Schweitzer is conducting himself at the moment in his own paper.
You will have read the article about Lassalle in the Fortnightly, 3 and will have seen that you are regarded therein as the real papa of Lassallean and other socialism.
Who is this Ludlow? If he could be prevailed upon to write an article in the Fortnightly about your book,b this would be better than nothing after all.
— Congreve's reply to Huxley is the DULLEST, most stupid and most confused thing I have ever seen0; if this is the supreme wisdom of the Comtists, they can let themselves to be buried without further ado.
I still must not strain my eye too much, and I feel it a little again today, since I read too much by lamplight yesterday evening; so I am closing.
On Saturday1* we received a very jolly letter from Tussy.

-<• 10 April 186 MARX TO ENGELS 174 IN MANCHESTER London, 15 April 1869 DEAR FRED, Jennychen arrived safely on Wednesday.
332 During the return journey they had such fog at sea that the ship had a hair's-breadth escape from running aground.
From Wilhelm 333 the enclosed note.
You will see, d'abord 3 his first answer to my query 84 about the 'knavish tricks' of which he accuses Schweitzer.
'Political' amongst this—only two enclosed ELECTIONEERING things.
You must send them back to me, for Wilhelm asks for them back, and they appear to constitute his entire political 'evidence for the prosecution'.
Lafargue has sent me his French translation of the Communist Manifesto for us to revise.
I am sending you the manuscript by post today.
For the moment, the business is not urgent.
I certainly do not want Lafargue to burn his fingers prematurely.
However, if the stuff is eventually to be published in France, certain parts, such as those on German or 'True' Socialism, should be reduced to a few lines, since they are of no interest there.
To get back to the negotiations with Wilhelm.
J write to him 84 about the conditions on which you are ready to give him the Peasant War.
h He writes to you that Eccarius (who knew nothing about the matter) had informed him you would send him the stuff, and that he would not fulfil the conditions you laid down.
He further writes to me that he has owed Eccarius 30 thaler for 2 quarters, and that / should advance it, since he would, 'on his word of honour', repay it at an—unspecified—date.
I certainly feel no inclination towards this transaction, since I have already loaned somewhat more than this sum to my friend Dupont.
Ludlow is BARRISTER AT LAW, a leading contributor to the Spectator, a co-operator, devout, a determined enemy of the Comtists.
He resigned publicly from our Commonwealth because Beesly, Harri­ son, etc.
, were contributors.
He had sent me a few of his little pamphlets at an earlier date, and is a friend of Jones Lloyd or Lloyd Jones, or whatever the tailor's name is.

) I naturally knew he read German.
At the same time, I sent him a letter in which I made a few JOKES about his article, in which he first stated that Lassalle disseminated my principles in Germany and then that I disseminated Lassalle's principles in England.
" (Reply in No.
2.
) I hope by this means still to achieve a review of my book in an English paper.
334 Ludlow is, ditto, a great admirer of Ricardo, something exceptional today, after Mill mucked every­ thing up.
I discovered BY ACCIDENT today that we had two Neveu de Rameau b in our house, and so am sending you one.
This unsurpassed masterpiece will once again give you a treat.
Referring to it, OLD Hegel said: 'The mocking laughter at existence, at the confusion of the whole and at itself, is the disintegrated consciousness, aware of itself and expressing itself, and is, at the same time, the last audible echo of all this confusion.
.
.
.
It is the self-disintegrating nature of all relations and their conscious disintegration.
.
.
In this aspect of the return to self, the vanity of all things is the self's own vanity, or the self is itself vanity .
.
.
but as the indignant consciousness it is aware of its own disintegration and, by that knowledge, has immediately transcended it.
.
.
Every part of this world either gets its mind [sein Geist] expressed here or is spoken of intellectually [mit Geist] and declared for what it is.
—The honest consciousness' (the role Diderot allots himself in the dialogue) 'takes each element as a permanent entity and does not realise, in its uneducated thoughtlessness, that it is doing just the opposite.
But the disintegrated consciousness is the consciousness of reversal and indeed of absolute reversal; its dominating elements is the concept, which draws together thoughts that, to the honest consciousness, lie so wide apart; hence the brilliance [geistreich] of its language.
Thus, the content of the mind's speech of and about itself consists in the reversal of all conceptions and realities; the universal deception of oneself and others and the shamelessness of declaring this deception is, therefore, precisely the greatest truth.
.
.
To the quiet consciousness, which in its honest way goes on singing the melody of the True and the Good in even tones, i.
e.
, on a monotone, this speech appears as "a farrago of wisdom and madness", etc.
' c (a passage from Diderot follows).
More amusing than Hegel's commentary is that by Mr Jules Janin, which you will find in the form of an excerpt in the postscript to the little volume.
This 'cardinal de la mer' d deplores the absence in Diderot's Rameau of the moral point, and consequently sets things in order by discovering that Rameau's entire absurdity arises from his resentment at not being a 'born gentilhomme'.
" The Kotzebue-like muck he has heaped upon this cornerstone is being melodramatically presented in London.

3 I would not be at all surprised if it were to be found in the English BLUE BOOK,173 in an English legation letter from Athens.

So he must be coming soon.

The Ludlow correspondence very useful.
Many thanks for the Rameau* which will give me much pleasure.
At the moment I am reading almost nothing, in order finally to get my eye back on the right track; I have also cut down on my work at the office.
Wilhelm is badly mistaken if he thinks I would send him the Peasant War b on the basis of such vague promises, so he could subsequently pop up and yell that, if I did not send the sum of umpteen pounds, it would be impossible to print the final sheets.
His letter is real twaddle, and his calm assumption that you should pay his fees is impudent.
Fowler, the STIPENDIARY MAGISTRATE here, who had the Fenians brought into court shackled to one another, has relinquished his post.
Leaving behind his wife and 2 children, he has eloped with the wife of Milne, the CHAIRMAN OF QUARTER SESSIONS (daughter of the late Brooks, the rich BANKER, and WORTH £80,000 IN HER OWN RIGHT), who, for her part, left 5 children with her beloved husband.

My wife is coughing badly, and I am waiting that out; as soon as she can travel, she will go to Paris TO FETCH TUSSY.
332 I shall perhaps come up with the latter.

26 April 1869 In addition there are some things to put in order in the International this week, which won't get going without me.
339 And finally, however bad I might feel, I have to complete CERTAIN SLIPS OF PAPER, since it is always difficult to continue, not with A NEW SUBJECT, but in the middle of a certain topic.
WITH ALL THAT, if I don't get better, I shall naturally have to go away.
More tomorrow.

I am just head over heels immersed in work.
Now first as to your animals.
Sambo has become almost inseparable from me, to make some way or other up for the absence of his supreme master.
Blacky behaves always like a gentleman, but a very dull one, too.
Tommy has again done everything in her power to prove the truth of the Malthus theory.
Helenb will to-day, I suppose, murder the new offspring of that old hag.
Whiskey, that great and good personage, was at first like Calipso not to be consoled, desperate at your departure.
He declined the finest bones, never left your bedroom, and altogether exhibited all symptoms of the deep sufferings of a 'schöne Seele.
c Still, when your name is uttered, he gets into a fit.
— Dicky has turned out a very fine singer, and we both encourage our respective musical talents by mutual 'exercises'.
Sometimes, how-a Eleanor Marx was called in the family by a humorous nickname of Chinese Prince Quo-Quo.

Marx to Eleanor Marx.
26 April 1869 271 ever, when I commence whistling, Dicky treats me as Luther treated the devil—he turns his .
.
.
upon me.
Jocko has come out again, but its temper is as bad as possible.
Having ascertained that you are absent, it gave vent to every sort of spleen and baffled all Helen's attempts at coaxing.
Another source of annoyance for Jocko, was the arrangement of the little garden—a world Jocko considered justly as its own station and domain—by the gardener.
Jocko misses its little hills, caves, rents, and all that lively disorder it delighted in.
As to the other 'animals'—as they belong not to the dumb sort, but are rather of a most talkative kind, and perfectly able to account for their own doings—I shall just now not lose one syllable upon them.
On Friday evening,3 I was at dinner at Beesley's.
Besides myself, there was Crompton, a barrister, and Jung and Dupont.
Jung related his own doings.
He told them what 'happy (literal!) speeches he made here, and what 'cutting hits' he made there.
In this world of ' Weltschmerz ,h discontent, and restlessness, it gladdens your heart to be acquainted with an individual that is 'happy' and, moreover, possesses not only one shirt, but Sarah and other good things into the bargain.
The Irishman I send you tomorrow.
Many thanks to Cacadouc for her letter.
Many kisses to Fouschtra.
d And compliments to the African.
340 It will give him great pleasure to hear—if he has not already seen from the French papers, that the first 'black' ambassador of the United States has been appointed by Grant.

You can imagine the jubilation awakened here by the news that you would bring Tussy with you, YOU ARE NOW IN FOR IT and must bring her with you whatever happens.
And if she can only come a few days after you, that doesn't matter, we could meet her at the station.
You might come rather earlier for health reasons.
You do not write how you are doing; if I were in your shoes, I would put everything aside and come here, the sooner the better; why let the business become chronic and torment you for so long when the cure is at hand any day.

It is curious how, everywhere on the Continent, the people, relying on the International, simply launch strikes, and apparently have not the faintest intention of filling the general war-chest.
Tomorrow will, I hope, finally be that more lively 'tomorrow' when you will 'at last' get down to letting us have more news of you.
b In the debate on the trade regulations324 Wilhelm played a quite deplorable role.
All the motions came either from Schweitzer or from Bebel, and Wilhelm wisely kept his mouth shut, since positive knowledge was called for in this case.
Schweitzer was also a treat when he tried to prove that the ban on Sunday work=increased consumption by the worker=wage rise.

However, there were several other additional INCIDENTS.
D'abord,c my wife was very unwell.
As soon as the business had got a bit better, last Tuesday,d she went to Paris, but arrived there quite benumbed.
Paris has adopted the unmannerly custom of conforming to the London weather.
When it rains here, it does there too, etc.
Second, Eichhoff e arrived here, and is still here.

Their task here, and it seems to be succeeding, is to find names for the prospectus of a bank in East Prussia, which has already received a concession.
Finally, there were the massacres beiges.
After addresses had streamed in from all quarters, as you will see from the enclosed papers, it finally became necessary for the CENTRAL COUNCIL73 to speak on this really important issue.
I was appointed to edit the ADDRESS.
3 If I had refused, the business would have fallen into the hands of Eccarius, who would be a square peg in a round hole for a vital docu­ ment like this.
So I accepted.
In view of the present state of my liver, it was very awkward to do it in English — since such things call for a certain rhetorical style—but then, in addition, the agony afterwards TO DO THIS IN FRENCH! But necessity knows no law, and I DID IT IN FRENCH.
TO start with, I wanted to send the thing to the Belgians in the original English, but our Belgian secretary Bernard (French by birth) declared to the assembled patres conscripti h (last Tuesday0) that it would be better to abandon the project altogether if the translation was going to be left to the Belgians, who only half knew English and absolutely no French.
So I HAD TO GIVE WAY.
You will be able to enjoy the thing in both languages.
However, I left the German translation, which does not interest me, to Mr Eccarius, who also has a monetary interest.
344 But writing French, with or without liver, is dead easy if you give the public the sort of French used by Mr Urquhart in the Diplomatic Review which is travelling to you today.
Astonishing double Dutch—even the original sample given by the grand and illustre Gaudissart d was nothing compared to this! After my wife left I would have been able to come to your place right away; and I would certainly have gained time by restoring the proper operation of this damnable sack of flesh earlier.
But Jennychen was looking forward to my wife's short absence in Paris, to have me entirely at her disposition and be able to let herself go.
So I stay here! Apropos Jennychen, she claims that you know everything, and therefore wants to know from you: WHY DID MR 'EXCELSIOR', 6 OF THE ALPINE CLUB, NOT MARRY 'LADY CLARA VERE DE VERE'f? About the FRENCHYg—Borchardt had his daughter II ask me a K.

8 May 1869 about him 345— I have only learned after a considerable waste of time that he is a lumpacius vagabundus,* who, however, held a SUBORDINATE post on the Glowworm, a very SUBORDINATE lousy sheet.
Communicate this to the doctorly priest or the priestly doctor.
Don't forget to report to me on that Dr Heinemann OF Manchester, the sub-Stieber on Hermann.
As TO Wilhelm b: Eichhoff brought Eccarius a gratification of £10 (I believe Eichhoff paid it out of his own private pocket) for 'my Mill', but told me, in confidence, that 'my Mill' 346 had been printed but now lay firmly aground with the Leipzig printer,0 who demanded exactly double the printing costs stated by Mr Wilhelm.
Your steps were, therefore, prophetically correct.
Meissner wrote to me more than a fortnight ago that he would start, 347 but NOTHING OF THE SORT! This is really too much.
According to Eichhoff's report, credit swindling and the FINANCING game are at present so dominant in Germany that everything else is absorbed by them, as far as the upper classes are concerned.
As for the workers in Berlin, he declares they are the most contemptible specimens in the whole of Germany.
Even the imported ones are soon totally corrupted by the city's atmosphere, and the 'low-priced' minor amusements.
Bismarck, Duncker, Schulze-Delitzsch and Dr Max Hirsch compete for ascendancy in this sphere.
The old Hatzfeldt's Scurvy-Mende used to be an itinerant improviser and declaimer, a brute who belongs through and through to the lumpenproletariat.
Hasenclever has allowed himself to be captured by Schweitzer.
Eichhoff praises Bebel greatly.
Harney—today under-secretary or SOMETHING OF THE SORT in the HOME DEPARTMENT of the COMMONWEALTH OF Massachusetts (they still say officially 'COMMONWEALTH' and not 'REPUBLIC') — in Boston, has sent £1 membership fee to the INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL,11 ditto a letter in which he asks after you very affectionately.
Ditto, he says I should send him A COPY OF Capital.
He hopes to find a translator and publisher in New York.
A Frenchman who has translated various volumes of Hegel and Kant has written to Lafargue stating that he wants to Frenchify the book/ but—and what a visionary idea—for an honorarium of £60, for which sum he will also provide the bookseller.

b For the subscription list for the Belgians it would be very good if you could also send us SOMETHING from Manchester, and quickly.
Apropos.
In the report on the EMPLOYMENT of AGRICULTURAL CHILDREN (only 2 volumes out yet, Report I and EVIDENCE), the COMMISSIONERS, in their preliminary resume, present a variety of facts about the expropriation of the workers from common land, quite in my sense.

The Irish pamphlet caused a great sensation here.
Ask Eichhoff if he can get the Peasant War e printed by his brother/ Meissner is obviously frightened.
Here we are in a lovely industrial crisis, and despite the SHORT TIME, too much is still being produced.
The only means the manufacturers have of agreeing among themselves on SHORT TIME and a shutdown is—a STRIKE by the workers.
They have been working towards this in a planned way for 2 months now.

First, I suffered for many weeks from the liver complaint that always afflicts me in the months of spring, which is all the more vexatious since it lays me almost completely fallow for intellectual work.
Second, I was waiting impatiently from day to day for the photogram you want, which Mr Fehrenbach, a German clot, has still not delivered.

3 As we are completely isolated from the RESPECTABLE PRESS, it will be difficult for us to act for you in this field, BUT WE SHALL TRY.
I intend to descend on you ABOUT the end of August with my daughter,1" and to lodge with you until the end of September wherever you want in Germany 49; even at the risk of suspending the completion of my manuscript.
0 No longer period is, of course, at my disposal.
I have read your letter to Borkheim.
You note quite rightly that the St Bartholomew chatter about the BELGIAN MASSACRES WILL NOT DO.
Yet you, for your part, overlook the importance and particular meaning of these events.
Belgium, you should know, is the sole country where sabres and muskets regularly, year in, year out, have the last word in every STRIKE.
350 The matter is made clear in an address of the GENERAL COUNCIL here, which I have written in French and English.
*1 It should be printed (in English) by tomorrow.
I shall send it to you immediately.
In addition, I have just written an English address for the GENERAL COUNCIL of the International Association here to the NATIONAL LABOR UNION in the UNITED STATES e regarding the war with England,351 which the bourgeois Republicans over there want to stage JUST now.
Mr Meissner has had the (printed and corrected) manuscript of the 18th Brumaire since the end of January, but to date he has repeatedly delayed publication.
This is pleasant too! He is waiting until the time for a possible effect has passed, for stupid bookselling reasons.
With best wishes to your dear wife and Fränzchen.

You WILL NOW HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME.
The current account is so far correct, but I cannot calculate how interest at 5% on 27,924.

5 instead of 1,396.

6 thalers.
But since this does not amount to more than a bottle of moselle wine it is not worth altering much.
Not a step further contractually with Gottfried.
3 The lawyers are protracting the matter excessively; my lawyer advises me not to hurry, since Gottfried has more interest in coming to a conclusion than I have, which I believe too, because as soon as I have my money I can, if the worst came to the worst, always start up a business again and compete with him; to do this I don't need to start by collecting lots of samples and notes; I've got all that in my head.
In the meantime, I have already taken the greater part of my money out of the business and invested in shares, and this in such a way that he himself is now short of money, and I have purchased shares from him for about £2,400; at first he encouraged me to draw funds liberally, but he got out of his depth when I drew about £7,500, and so he had to sell me these shares himself, as he held just the sort I needed.
I am very sorry that I was so deceived by the business with the reform of weights352 at your end.
I thought that such a measure would not be introduced if it were not to be carried out absolutely and be made valid for all This, however, would have meant completely excluding yourselves from the market outside Ger­ many, and I concluded that you were not very interested in business outside Germany.
Had this not been the case, I would, as I mentioned to Adolf b 2 years ago, and to mother last year, have a Gottfried Ermen -b Adolf von Griesheim 200.
Engels to Hermann Engels.
13 May 1869 281 first asked you whether you would like to go into business outside Germany, and if so, to what extent we could come to an arrangement.
But I had to assume the contrary, and therefore arranged my business with G.
Ermen, and now, after this was arranged, mother writes to me that you have made this weight reform for Germany only.
In this case I, in your place, would not have done it at all, since in Holland, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, etc.
, they want anything except dutiable weight, and when you expand your business outside Germany you will have just as much trouble and entanglement as before.
Mother writes to me that 4,000 thalers were credited to me there on 1 April.
This will have reduced my account to about 17,000 thalers, which will be further reduced by the COPS, which have been bought cheap and will soon be ready.
This I shall remit to you in thalers at the beginning of July, since it is high time that I also finally profited from the rate of exchange.
If you would prefer STERLING, that's all right too, providing we share equally, you half and I half, the whole rate-of-exchange profit you have made since 1860 on my remittances, and also the 35-38% discount you stuck on me then.
Regarding the cops, there can be no question of obtaining them directly from the spinners, since these people don't know anything, and don't want to know anything, about forwarding and advices.
You will have to pay the 11/?% brokerage of some commission house, which will be well worth while, as differences of quality arise at the spinners, of which you know nothing, etc.
For instance, for years I purchased the 45 from Samuel Taylor & Son in Oldham, but now suddenly the same yarn from John Wagstaffe & Co.
in Stalybridge, which you and we used to utilise, has suddenly become much cheaper, so I am buying it again.
The 55s and finer yarns are all from John Knowles in Bolton (formerly J.
8c G.
Knowles), and you will have to stick to this yarn, or to that of his brother G.
Knowles & Son, Bolton.
Will you select a commission agent or shall I suggest one? As soon as you have chosen one, I can explain everything to the man, face to face.
Incidentally, I always had the name of the spinners placed on the invoices.
Among my papers I found the original contract with Peter Ermen of 1862, and wanted to send it to you; but I discover that it is the one dealing only with the business here, so it would be of no use to you.
So I shall keep it here, but if you should ever need it, you now know where it is.
The arrangement about there you have there.

Marx to Engels.
14 May 1869 G.
Ermen said recently to his nephew Heinrich 3: 'There is really nothing to be done with Anton, b his head is completely worn out.
' I calculate that the fellow has damaged us here, directly and indirectly, to the tune of between £1,000 and £2,000 per year.

Eichhoff left yesterday.
His proposal — quant àc the Peasant War—is that his brother should publish the stuff and that he pay out the balance ON BEHALF of the 'International' at the next Book Fair, after subtracting his commission and costs.
e He says: as far as his brother is concerned, you may regard the proposal as definitive.
With regard to Herr Vogt: When Liebknecht was arrested in Berlin, he left everything in confusion and, ditto, he did not clear up at the time of his EXPULSION.
So 'he cannot remember' what happened to Vogt.
1 Eichhoff finally discovered that a second-hand bookseller had been advertising the book for 2 years in his sales catalogue.
He visited the fellow, named Kampfmeyer.
He had sold them all, and 'ditto cannot remember' how the books came into his hands.
So everything Liebknecht told us was—fiction, to put it mildly.

• Qjo Published in English for the nrst time 203 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 21 MAY 1869 DEAR FRED, Tussy and my wife returned from Paris on Wednesday," and I intended to come to Manchester with Tussy tomorrow.
In the meantime, this has been made impossible by an economic obstacle.
The various Paris journeys by Jenny, Tussy and Madame, and the purchases connected therewith, have naturally entailed extra expenditure for me.
Second, there were borrowings to a sum of £14, which I absolutely could not avoid, BY AN UNHAPPY coincidence of circumstances.
Dupont, the soundest of the people here, has not only chômage? 3 but his wife is hopelessly ill.
He is such a discreet man that he borrows from nobody, except in extreme need, and he is so conscientious that he always pays back.
So I loaned him £6.
Then along came Lessner, put into difficult circumstances by his wife's long and finally fatal illness.
I could deny him all the less since I was myself his debtor for a long time.
Thus £5.
Finally the worthy Liebknecht (after writing to me in vain on the subject) writes to Eccarius himself, asking him to approach me for an advance.
I told Eccarius that I had already turned Wilhelm down.
But Eccarius wailed—and this is a fact—that he would be turned out of the house if I did not advance him at least £2 for rent owing.
I thus did this, but at the same time wrote to Wilhelm that he should return it to me.
So £14 a 19 May -b unemployment 203.
Marx to Engels.
21 May 1869 285 OUT OF POCKET.
All this left me with £15 lying in petto.
But then, yesterday, A CERTAIN Drengler (nomen omen") arrived from the City with a letter from Mr Zitschke in New York, who 13 years ago loaned me £15, and then suddenly disappeared from London because of embezzlement (he dispatched emigrants to New York).
TURNS NOW UP AGAIN with the old loan, which I had thought settled by his defection with the cash.
I had to deal with the matter all the more because, in the meantime, he has become friendly with Mr Heinzen; in the event of a refusal to pay, he would have been able to 'Pioneer me out' .
b Thus cleaned out.
Fox has died in Vienna after a 5-day pulmonary disease.
His family left in poverty.
Letters on this have reached me from Vienna.
Fox's mother (Peter Fox nom de plume, c real name Peter Fox André) is a rich woman, who, however, left him completely in the lurch, partly because he married her abigail (now old), and partly because of his atheism.
I have now approached her, threatening that if she does not give something, public collections will be held for her son in London.
Meissner sent me, 1 week ago, the 1st sheet of the 18th Brumaire, and wrote that things should now go 'quickly'.
But sheet 2 is not here yet.
He appears to be dragging the matter out as long as possible.

5296-5297, the original London, March 1981 206 MARX TO PAUL LAFARGUE IN PARIS Manchester, 2 June 1869 My dear Paul, You can, of course, dispose of my name as you like.
Still, there are some objections.
In the first instance, what you want, is work which, for the present, I am unable to perform, while Engels still suffers from an inflammation of the eyes which for some time is sure to debar him from writing.
Of course, if a very urgent question arose, we should address ourselves to the Renaissance, 283 but this could be done without my name figuring amongst the rédacteurs.
A merely nominal co-editorship would prove of no possible avail.
However, my most serious objection is of an exclusively private nature, and I leave it to your discretion to decide the case.
The intended paper will probably involve you and your friends in judicial conflicts with the government, and your father, 3 becoming sooner or later aware of my name figuring among a François Lafargue 288 206.
Marx to Paul Lafargue.
2 June 1869 the rédacteurs of that paper, would be likely to draw the conclusion that I had pushed you to premature political action, and prevented you from taking the steps necessary (and which I am continuously urging you to take 3) to pass your medical examina­ tions and establish you professionally.
He would justly consider such presumed influence on my part as running counter to our express mutual engagement.
As to the misgivings of Le Petit, b they are altogether unfounded.
To make ready for an invasion of France, Prussia would, under the most favourable circumstances, want instead of 8 days at least one month.
But the circumstances are now anything but favourable to her.
There exists, in point of fact, no German unity.
It could only be founded by a German Revolution, sweeping away the Prussian dynasty, which was, is, and must always be, the man-servant of the Muscovite.
It is only by the overthrow of 'Prussia' that Germany can become really centralised.
Prussia has not merged into Germany.
It has, on the contrary, conquered a part of Germany, and treats it—the directly annexed provinces as well as those pressed into the Northern German Confederation — as a conquered land.
Hence the greatest disaffec­ tion prevails in her new acquisitions.
In case of an offensive (not defensive) war against France, Prussia would be forced to employ a large part of its army for the purpose of keeping down these provinces, the more dangerous since her means of communication with France, such as railways, telegraphs etc.
run through them, and the Prussian lines of retreat from the Rhine pass through them.
As to the military contingents raised from Hanover, Schleswig-Holstein, Saxony, Kurhessen, Nassau etc.
, they could not be relied upon, and would prove a source of weakness instead of strength.
Apart from these provinces, either directly annexed or pressed into the Northern German Confederation, there is Southern Germany (Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria, Hessen-Darmstadt) num­ bering 9 millions.
Here the popular masses are Anti-Prussian to the core.
In case of a war against France, Prussia would, therefore, have to detach another part of her army in order to make sure of that part of Southern Germany which, on a long-stretched line, borders upon France.
And last, not least, Prussia would be bound to concentrate a strong army of observation against Austria.
Do not forget that the Hapsburg Dynasty is sorely smarting under the recent humilia-a See this volume, pp.

-b Louis Auguste Blanqui 206.
Marx to Paul Lafargue.
2 June 1869 289 tions and losses3M inflicted upon it by the Prussian upstart.
a Admit even the quite absurd hypothesis, that the Hapsburg Dynasty was ready to condone for the past, it would still be unable to support Prussia.
The Austrian Emperorb has no longer any control over international affairs.
The Hungarian diet has now to decide, and it would decide for France against Prussia.
So would the Vienna diet.
Thus, however friendly the apparent attitude of the Vienna Cabinet might be, Prussia could and would not rely upon it, but find herself always obliged to detach a strong army of observation against the army which Austria would be sure to concentrate in Bohemia.
Hence you see de prime abora\ c that of the seemingly formidable military power of Prussia a very large part would not be available against France, but, on the contrary, would have to be frittered away in different directions.
Prussia would have no ally except Russia who is not able to dispose of her army on a sudden emergency.
Before her contingents had been mobilised and had entered Prussia the whole campaign would have been decided.
The very idea that Prussia, under such circumstances, would venture single-handed, as she must do, upon an invasion of France, and revolutionary France too, is incorrect.
I have till now considered only the strictly military and diplomatic aspect of the question but there is not the least doubt that in case of a Revolution in France, Prussia would have to act now as in 1848.
Instead of throwing her forces abroad, she would be forced to absorb them in expeditions à l'intérieur.
If, in 1848, the movement in Germany paralysed the Prussian Government, what would the case be now, when the popular masses in Prussia and the other parts of Germany, are much more developed, and, simultaneously, the Prussian government as well as the other German governments have ceased to be absolute and been weakened by the trammels of a mock constitutionalism? As to the German working classes, they are, in my opinion, better organised than the French ones.
Their ideas are more international than in any other country.
Their atheism is more pronounced than in any other country.
Their predilection for France, is general.
Prussia can do nothing in case of a French Revolution.

On the one hand, I should like to oblige Blanqui.
On the other hand, my other occupations will not allow me to do much for them, but, above all things, I fear lest old Lafarguea should suspect me to push his son to premature political action and make him neglect his professional duties.

1, Milano, 1958 208 MARX TO HIS DAUGHTER JENNY IN LONDON Manchester, 10 June 1869 My dear child, I was firmly resolved to leave Manchester yesterday.
But on the pretext, that, during the first week of my stay, I had been an invalid, Engels insisted so much upon my remaining here till Monday next, that I had to give way.
353 He is really too kind towards me to seriously oppose such a whim on his part.
On our three days' trip to the Devonshire Arms, near the Bolton Abbey, I made the acquaintance of a most strange fellow, Mr Dakyns, a geologist, who lives transitorily in that part of Yorkshire in order to make a geological survey.
En passant, you ought to know that a geological map is taken up of all England, under the orders of government, and under the leadership of Professor Ramsay, of Jermyn street.
Moore is himself a geologist.
By him Engels and Schorlemmer became acquainted with Dakyns who lives in a farmer house, in midst of a Yorkshire wilderness.
That farmer's house was also an old abbey, and the lower part of it still serves as a chapel.
It was to see Dakyns that we set out for that part of the world.
Dakyns looks much like a German peasant of stunted side, with a face always grinning a broad smile, something monkeyish in the formation of his head, nothing British about him save the protruding upper set of teeth which reminded me of the late Mrs Seiler.
His dress is about that of a slovenly and ' wnderdressed' farm servant, of utmost negligence.
Cravat and such paraphernalia of civilisation he is a stranger to.
The first impression he makes upon you is that of a 292 208.
Marx to His Daughter Jenny.
10 June 1869 boorish clown whose good heart leaps through his eyes and grins on his lips, but you would give him no credit for intellect.
Still, this is a highly scientific man, even an enthusiast for his science and whose name begins already to pierce through a big valley of rivals.
He is naive like a child; without the least pretention always ready to communicate his scientific discoveries to the first comer wanting to pump him out.
There is in fact always a couple of other geological surveyors swarming to and from him for the express purpose to beat money out of him, or fame, by appropriating his researches.
In fact, we found him in the company of two such fellows, one of whom, named Ward, was a timid youth and the other, named Green, a bold, pushing man.
We had a dinner on his farm—on Sunday last—in the room directly lying over the chapel.
The room had evidently formerly served as an assembly room of the monks, big walled (ich meine, mit dicken Mauern umgeben 3), with a look out to magnificent trees, and to an amphitheatrical group of mountains, the one overtopping the other, and wrapt in that blue veil Currer Bell b is so delighted with.
During the very merry, and in spite of its rusticity comfortable dinner, the singsong of the youth in the chapel, coming from the depth, intercepted by the big walls, and sounding as from a far-away place, reminded me somewhat of the Christian Song in Faust.
c Well, our friend Dakyns is a sort of Felix Holt,d less the affectation of that man, and plus the knowledge (by the by, the Tories here say 'Felix Holt, the rascal', instead of the 'radical').
He invites once a week the factory lads, treats them to beer and tobacco, and chats with them on social questions.
He is a 'naturwüchsiger"' communist.
I could of course not forbear making a little fun of him and warning him to fight shy of any meeting with Mrs Eliot who would at once lay hold of him and make literary property out of him.
He had already written to Moore that he wanted to enter the International.
So I brought him a card and he made a donation, as his entrance fee, of 10 sh.
, which is a sum for him.
These men get only 150 £ a year, and have very hard work, mentally and bodily.
The Government could not afford to get these men at such a price, if it was a mere matter of competition, but most of them are full of 'geological' a I mean, surrounded by thick walls -b pseudonym of Charlotte Brontë -c Apparently the reference is to the angels' chorus in Gounod's opera Faust.

10 June 1869 293 zeal and improve this opportunity afforded them of making researches.
They are provided with cards which bind every landowner, farmer and so forth, to allow them to walk over their estates, and farms and look into the formation of the soil.
Dakyns, who has a good deal of farcical humour about himself, often enters into a farm, takes out his instruments, and sets at working, when the farmer comes up, growls at the impudent intruder, and bids him to pack himself off, lest he want to become acquainted with the teeth of his dog or the momentum of his flail.
Dakyns affects not to mind him, proceeds in his business, and provokes the boor by some bad jokes.
When the comedy has been approaching to a certain climax, he pulls out his card, and the cerberus is softened.
During our stay he gave me to read in the nick of time the last number of The Fortnightly Review—an article of Huxley3 where he merrily thrashes old Congreve.
Dakyns is also a declared enemy of the Comtists or Positivists.
He is of my opinion that there is nothing positive about them except their arrogance.
As to my friend Beesly, he mentioned him amongst the 'doctrinaires' who mistake their fanciful crotchets for science.
— In the same number of the Fortnightly is the second article of Millb on Thornton's Capital and Labour.
I saw from the criticism that both are equally small fry.
—Dakyns is a neighbour of ours.
That is to say, he lives at Kilburn (when in London) with his father, a lawyer.
Yesterday evening I had the unavoidable tea at the Gumperts.
Mrs Gumpert has been much affected by the teeth of time.
I have never before witnessed a more rapid change.
The hypocrisy of a Greek nose has given way to the true Jewish type, everything about her looks rather shrivelled and dried up, and the voice has that guttural sound which the selected people is to some degree cursed with.
Speaking of the disagreeableness to be in an omnibus, or at public firework, or in the theatre even near to the pit—all this because of the bad smells of the vile multitude, she said: 'I like the clean million, but not the dirty million'.
I affected to have understood, clear million, and said that it was a very common predilection with mankind to prefer a clear million of pounds sterling to any million of men, whether washed or unwashed.
And now my dear child addio.

And it is devilish to read or write when you don't know whether it is day or night.
Tussy is very jolly.
This morning the whole family went SHOPPING; tomorrow evening they want to go to the theatre.
She has read right through Hermann und Dorothea, 2 not without difficulty because of the idyllic philistines' twaddle.
Now I have given her the younger Edda, which contains several nice stories; then she can read from the elder one 362 the songs of Sigurd and Gudrun.
She also plays the piano sedulously.
I have also read Danish Kjämpeviser h with her.
So that is Wilhelm's entire success: that the male-female line and the all-female line of the Lassalleans have united!36S He really has achieved something there.
Schweitzer will naturally be re-elected— in view of the precipitacy with which the business has been conducted—and then he will, once again, be the chosen one of general suffrage.
Wilhelm is also preserving an obstinate silence about this event.
The Urningc you sent me is a very curious thing.
These are extremely unnatural revelations.
The paederasts are beginning to count themselves, and discover that they are a power in the state.
Only organisation was lacking, but according to this source it apparently already exists in secret.
And since they have such important men in all the old parties and even in the new ones, from Rösing to Schweitzer, they cannot fail to triumph.
Guerre aux cons, paix aus trous-de cul d will now be the slogan.

Unfortunately, he has not yet got up the courage to acknowledge publicly that he is 'that way', and must still operate coram publico 'from the front', if not 'going in from the front' as he once said by mistake.
But just wait until the new North German Penal Code recognises the droits du culb; then he will operate quite differently.
Then things will go badly enough for poor frontside people like us, with our childish penchant for females.
If Schweitzer could be made useful for anything, it would be to wheedle out of this peculiar honourable gentleman the particulars of the paederasts in high and top places, which would certainly not be difficult for him as a brother in spirit.
At the end of the week, Schorlemmer will be going to Germany for 4 weeks via Grimsby and Rotterdam.

3 What do you think? In any case, if books for 5 silver groschen don't sell, then one for 8 to 10 silver groschen will circulate even less.
The only thing that would help here would be a small pamphlet of 1-2 sheets at 21/2 silver groschen, but this needs work and is nothing for Meissner.

, neither to make nor sell bleached, coloured or dressed cotton cloth.
That was all right.
But his lawyer had set this out in such a way that, if I breached any stipulation, I was obliged, in advance, to pay a penalty rising from £100 to £1,000 for each single instance, so that, in these monetary penalties, I would have had to pay back to G.
Ermen more than the £1,750 paid to me, not counting the legal costs.
My lawyer advised me strongly not to agree, so we struck out the whole business, nearly half the whole draft.
Then there was another point, about the continuation of the firm Ermen & Engels by Gottfried.
My lawyer told me that if I explicitly allowed him to do this, then, in the case of insolvency, I could still be regarded as associe' and be held liable.
I therefore demanded that my explicit agreement to this should also be limited to 5 years, and this only so long as he himself was an active associé in the firm.
My Gottfried, who was originally very pressing with the negotiations, soon started dragging things out, and once even left the draft at home for 3 weeks without saying anything about it, so only about 3 weeks ago did I receive the 2nd draft contract (which is between G.
Ermen, Anton Ermen and me, and governs the arrangement when I leave), and because of the usual lawyers' formalities could only begin to negotiate 8 days ago.
In the past few days G.
Ermen appeared frequently to avoid me, as though he wished to delay the matter until I was out of the business, when he might hope to deal with me more easily.
Only yesterday morning did we get down to negotiations, and then Gottfried gave way on all points, while, for my part, I conceded him that, for 5 years, I would not spin and twine any cotton yarn under No.
40; I would remain free to trade in such yarn as long as it was in the raw condition.
This concession has no sort of practical importance for me, and I thus obliged him.
Thus the matter has now been concluded, with the exception of a few legal matters of form, and I think everything could be finished in three weeks; but I am resigned that it might last in to August, since the accounts must be completed, and the lawyers always drag things out so.
Yesterday afternoon I went to the mill with Gottfried and inspected the stores and the reception; afterwards we went to his a partner 302 214.

1 July 1869 house, where he served me a bottle of very good Scharzhofberger.
He is as glad as I am that the matter is finished, that he is now the sole master of the firm, and that he is not going to have a row with me, since 1.
as my lawyer tells me, if I had gone into partnership with my brothers, we would have been able to conduct the firm of Ermen & Engels here too, and we could prohibit him from doing so; 2.
he is anyway very much afraid of competition; and 3.
it now emerges that he still needs me very much for a time if bad blunders are to be avoided in the business; for this reason, he has invited me to come to the office as often as I like, and has requested me to give the people information from time to time, to which I naturally agreed.
He has engaged a young Stuttgarter as correspondent, but he has only been there for 3 weeks and is naturally still very green.
He'll have a heavy enough load.
Gottfried is not finished with Charles3 either; his notice runs out in 8 days.
I am curious whether they will reach an agreement.
Five years ago Charles obtained from him a promise to make him managing clerk, but has never received the post; now he is demanding £1,000 compensation for this, but Gottfried will never give it to him.
Neither does he seem to want to keep on Anton as an associé.
At least the 2nd draft contract dissolves the partnership with him in just the same manner as with me, and Gottfried would not go to this trouble if he did not intend it that way.
On the one hand, Gottfried has realised that Anton is worth absolutely nothing in practical business, i.
e.
, in earning money and, on the other, Anton continually draws so much money behind Gottfried's back, and sends it to his Julie b that Gottfried is apprehensive that he might some day start drawing money directly from the bank as long as he—Anton—has the right to sign.
When Anton joined, Gottfried advanced him £500, which represented Anton's capital, but Monsieur Anton, who should leave £250 yearly standing from his emoluments, has not only not done this, but has also squandered the £500 long ago.
My new freedom is just the thing for me.
Since yesterday I have been quite a new man, and ten years younger.
This morning, instead of going into the gloomy city, I walked in this wonderful weather for a few hours in the fields; and at my desk, in a comfortably furnished room in which you can open the windows without the smoke making black stains everywhere, with flowers on the windowsills and trees in front of the house, one can work a Charles Roesgen -b later Anton Ermen's wife 215.

In honour of this event, I drank 'one glass too many', but late in the evening, not before sunrise like the Prussian gendarmes.
Enclosed a momentous letter from Wilhelm, 872 from which you will see that he has suddenly appointed himself my curator, and lays down this and that which I 'must' do.
I must come to their August congress,573 must show myself to the German workers; must send the International cards immediately (after they had not replied to two queries on the subject in 3 months), must muck the Communist Manifesto about; must come to Leipzig! 3 Exodus 13:14; see also this volume, p.

Marx to Engels.
3 July 1869 It is really very naive that, in the same letter in which he complains that he cannot pay back the £2 (which I gave to Eccarius for him), he offers me my fare to Germany.
Toujours le même!" He appears to be morally indignant about you.
I have already replied to him that he has misinterpreted your letter.
The fellow simply cannot grasp that convictions and business management are not poles apart, as he assumes in his newspaper administration, and as others have to assume if they do not wish to become SUSPECTS.
Our Wilhelm has a sanguine nature and is a liar.
So there are probably, once again, exaggerations in his description of the victory over Schweitzer.
Still, there must be something in it.
Schweitzer would not have returned to the Church of Hatzfeldt had he not been shaky in his own association.
On the other hand, he speeded up the general dissolution by the doltish management of his latest coup d'état.
31'3 I hope that, as a result of this business, the German workers' movement will finally leave the stage of Lassallean infantile disorders behind, and that the Lassallean residue will decay in sectarian isolation.
As for Wilhelm's various 'absolute commandments', I have answered him TO THIS EFFECT: I feel absolutely no need to show myself to the German workers, and will not go to their congress.
Once they have really joined the International and given themselves a proper party organisation — and the Nuremberg Congress 13a showed how little trust can be put in just promises, tendencies, etc.
— then there will be an opportuni­ ty BY AND BY In addition, it must be CLEARLY understood that the new organisation must be, for us, neither People's Party38 nor Lassallean church—as little the one as the other.
If we went now we would have to speak against the People's Party, and that would not please Wilhelm and Bebel! And if they—mirabile dictu h— would themselves admit this, we would have to throw our weight directly onto the scales against Schweitzer and Co.
, instead of having the change-over appear as a free action by the workers.
As far as polishing up the Manifesto11 is concerned, we would consider this as soon as we have seen the decisions of their congress, etc.
He should hang on to his £2 and not worry about my fare.
I praise their action against Becker.

3 July 1869 305 That's all on that.
About Meissner it is probably best if I speak to him.
Incidentally, if you have time (that is, if it doesn't bother your eye) to finish something, it is easier to negotiate with a manuscript rather than without one.
I know enough to know that Meissner prefers 5 sheets to 2.
The shorter the pamphlet, the harder to sell, as he told me himself.
What do you say about the way that the virtuous Gladstone and puritanical Bright acted with regard to Overend, Gurney, et Co.
? 227 Remarkable, also, was Bruce's declaration on the Mold shoot­ ing,374 which was not so INNOCENT as the Manchester papers reported.
So the RIOT ACT375 need not be read.
It is enough for some fox-hunting UNPAID MAGISTRATE to whisper in the ear of an officer, and the peppering starts.
Yet even this is not necessary.
The soldiers may use their RIFLES IN SELF-DEFENCE (and they themselves judge whether this is necessary).
But then, shouldn't the ARMS ACTS 37f> be repealed, so everybody would be able to use his own RIFLE in SELF-DEFENCE against the soldiers? The Gurney business, or rather the attitude of the Ministry towards it, ditto the Mold affair, finally the ministerial trickery with Lamuda and other scoundrels against the TRADES-UNIONS-BILL3'7— have made a mighty big dent in the fascination held by the names Gladstone and Bright amongst the workers here in London.
Laura was ill and bed-riddèn for 14 days, but is said to be better now.
They have given notice on their rooms, and in October will move to a more airy locality (Montmartre or some such).

But always the same old story.
When he gets involved in a squabble with Schweitzer, you must always be called in to help.
This will happen again, too.

6 July 1869 307 As far as my letter is concerned, his moans about 'reproaches instead of money' are the exact counterpart of Bismarck's complaint: 'Gentlemen, we ask for bread, and you give us stones',a when his taxes were rejected.
The point that so 'upset' Mr Wilhelm was the question as to how he could tell me, in one and the same letter, that he did have the money to print the Peasant War, but at the same time had none for the sheet.
b Further, how is it that the sheet was already 'guaranteed' 1 V2 years ago, yet today it still doesn't pay? On this point, Monsieur Wilhelm is completely silent and is morally indignant that I should remind him of the shares he promised at that time to send voluntarily and by return; naturally I shall not get them now either, since Wilhelm says I shall 'naturally receive' them.
The shares were only mentioned in order to prompt Wilhelm to remark upon the status of the sheet; it is fairly clear to me that Wilhelm and his consorts have managed things so sloppily that the printer or some other creditor can take over the sheet, and turn them out as soon as it does pay.
In this case, it might be very agreeable for Mr Wilhelm if he had a few shareholders sitting here, who could exercise their legal claims in his favour.
If the idiot had given me a satisfactory answer (which, however, would scarcely have been possible), he would have got the money; but simply to send a demand, and this self-contradictory, and without excuse either for his earlier dawdling or a word on the condition of the sheet—I wouldn't think of it.
We don't want Wilhelm to get into the habit of things like that.
The extent to which his shouts of victory are premature is shown by the 4 numbers of Social-Demokrat that you sent me today.
Certainly Schweitzer is also a big liar, but, for the moment, he appears to have saved the mass of the RANK AND FILE.
However, things with him are going quickly downhill and, if he had any other opponent than Wilhelm, the process would be speeded up greatly.
But, of course, the sultry waffle Wilhelm is now having printed as his 'speech' 0 will not help much.
But Bebel is pressing Schweitzer hard, and cites some points that are very vexing to him, which would suggest the possibility that Schweitzer received his share of the Guelph funds surrendered to Stieber.
380 In any case, nothing can be done with Wilhelm until he has a Matthew 7:9 -b Demokratisches Wochenblatt (see also Note 372).

6 July 1869 quite definitely separated his organisation from the People's Party38 and placed himself, at most, in a loose cartel relationship with it.
Charming, too, is his intention of putting the International on the title of his sheet, which would then, at one and the same time, be the organ of the People's Party and of the International Working Men's Association! The organ both of the German petty bourgeoisie and of the European Workers! Another fine idea of Wilhelm's is that concessions to the workers should neither be accepted nor extorted from the 'present state'.
He'll get a long way with the workers like this.
I can't possibly prepare anything for you for Meissner in time.
Until the accounts have been balanced, I have to go into town at least 2-3 times weekly, and probably even more often over the next few weeks, since I have to check the stuff carefully.
My eye is much better, but still needs to be spared, since I don't want to make it worse again.
In addition, I must put a mass of other money matter's, my private accounts, etc.
, once and for all in order, and this is occupying me a lot too.
Also, and particularly in this special case, I would like to hear Meissner's views first, since you say he is rather sensitive on such matters.
Tell Jenny I shall reply to her as soon as the beer in question puts in an appearance here, which so far is not the case.
Tussy says she will write tomorrow.
She is now reading the Serbian folk songs in the German translation, and she appears to like them a lot; she has replaced me in giving piano lessons to Mary Ellen,'1 to the latter's great advantage.
When the weather is good and I don't have to go to town, we go for a walk for a few hours every morning, otherwise in the evening, WEATHER PERMITTING.
The pamphlet by Tridonb was mainly of interest to me because of the second part, since I am not familiar with the newer material about the first revolution.
The first part is, however, very confused, particularly about centralisation and decentralisation; it's a good thing that the Renaissance has been adjourned for the time being283; the people would have soon fallen foul of one another.
It's a comic idea that the dictatorship of Paris over France, which led to the downfall of the first revolution, could be accomplished without more ado today once again, and with a quite different result.
Bruce's statement about Mold374 has indeed proved that previous ideas about the English laws in this connection were quite a Mary Ellen Burns -b G.

9 July 1869 219 ENGELS TO JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) 382 IN LONDON Manchester, 9 July 1869 *Dear Jenny, * My best thanks for your two kind letters383 and for the beer which arrived safely on Wednesday and was tried on Thursday after a day's settling.
I have just been into the cellar to fetch another bottle up, it is very nice, and Lizziea especially likes it because it reminds her more of her beloved 'Bavarian' than the regular Vienna beer.
There is no doubt, it will soon be emptied, and the more so as I am afraid it will not keep very long in hot weather, being lighter than the common Vienna beer, so that there will be plenty of pretexts for taking frequent 'headers' into the cellar and fetching up a bottle or two of 'that same'.
*I, and indeed all of us, were very much amused with your description of that highly aristocratic soirée.
That little bit of a printed caution about mobbing, and the fact of its being sent round with the invitations, 384 is more than characteristic of 'that lot', as we say here in Lancashire.
Very good, too, on the part of these Britishers, to describe this, their own darling 'vulgar habit' as one 'common throughout Europe'—common, indeed, wherever the British snob—and the snob and the flunkey is at the bottom of all of them—puts his foot! * I'd like to see any place on the Continent where such a circular would be issued on such an occasion.
To be sure, it clearly follows from the entire story that the admixture of rich UPSTARTS has also begun winning the upper hand in aristocratic areas, AND IN FACT, IS NOW SWAMPING 'SOCIETY'.
So much the better.
Your description, like the circular, fits our Manchester MOCK-'SOCIETY' completely, and the more the smart mob in London Manchesterises, the more gratifying for us.
* I am just now in the honey-moon of my newly-recovered liberty, and you will not require to be told that I enjoy it amazingly.
369 As my eye, although very much better, still requires a little * careful treatment, * I have not yet settled down to regular work and indeed shall not be able to do so until all my business a Lizzy Burns.

9 July 1869 311 affairs are regularly settled, which will take about a month.
In the meantime I walk about a good deal with Tussy and as many of the family, humane and canine, as I can induce to go with us.
We have just come back from a long walk through the fields to Heaton Chapel, about 5 or 6 miles the way we went, Tussy, Lizzie, Mary Ellen," myself and two dogs, and I am specially instructed to inform you that these two amiable ladies had two glasses of beer a-piece (this is the vernacular Lancashire in which I got my orders).
No wonder I had to bring them home by the train (we have a station about seven minutes' walk from our house), but no sooner arrived, than they walked, in common with me, into your Lager-Beer.
Now they are getting their tea ready, or getting themselves ready for it, I don't know which, and after that there will be a reading of Irish novels which is likely to last till bedtime or nearly so, unless relieved by a bit of talk about the 'convicted nation'.
b Anyhow, they seem to like it, and so it's all right to me.
* Meanwhile they all send you the heartiest greetings, and I'll do the same.

I still had the enclosed photograph of Lupus,b but none of me, and only after frequent sittings last winter did I get a bearable one; 2.
then I found that the Lupus photo had been mislaid and, des­ pite all the searching, could not be found.
So, 3.
I got the photographer who had the negative to make 24 more copies of Lupus, but they turned out miserably, since it was very faded, and I wouldn't like to send any of them.
Finally, 4.
I found the original one and les voici c both.
I regretted to hear through Marx that you had to undergo an operation and that, now, for the summer, you want to live healthily, which is certainly very useful, and here and there also probably pleasant.
I hope this will put you properly on your feet again, but will probably have the result that our friend Schorlem-mer, who has been in Germany for 14 days, and who wanted to go via Hanover and visit you in about 10-12 days, will not find you there.
Marx will probably be coming to Germany with his daughter Jenny at the end of this month or the beginning of next,349 how things will be with me I don't know yet, for the following reasons: On 30 June this year my agreement with my present associé 6 expired.
36 According to my original calculations, at the beginning of the agreement I had expected that, on its expiry, I would have made enough money out of noble COMMERCE to live on, though very modestly by standards here, and be able to bid adieu to trade.
This did not ensue completely, but after various negotiations with my associé we finally agreed that I would allow him to use my name in the firm for 5 years, and I would promise during these 5 years not to go into competition with him, for which he paid me quite a nice round sum, so that I have, in fact, reached the point a In the manuscript: 89 -b Wilhelm Wolff -c here are -d partner 220.
Engels to Kugelmann.
10 July 1869 313 at which I aimed.
Since the 1st inst.
I have been out of the business, and my time is finally my own again—that is, for the time being, purely theoretically since I cannot leave here until the balance has been drawn and the necessary documents have been arranged by the lawyers; and I shall still have to waste a lot of time to put these matters in order.
I expect, however, to be finished during next month, and if you would let me know where you will be about that time, it might be possible for all of us to meet somewhere in Germany.
I don't need to tell you how happy I am to be rid of that damned commerce, and to be able to work for myself again.
Particularly, too, since this was possible just now, when events in Europe are taking an increasingly critical turn and when, one fine day, the thunder may clap quite unexpectedly.
The Lassallean sect appears, not without dialectical irony, to seek its effective dissolution precisely in its nominal reunifica­ tion.
386 Schweitzer may, for the moment, still hold the majority of the people together, but no party or sect can endure the repeated expulsion of its leaders.
And this time the dirty washing of this extremely unclean clique will produce all sorts of curiosa, which can only harm Schweitzer.
The dissolution of the Lassallean sect and, on the other hand, the severence of the Saxon and South German workers from the leading-strings of the 'People's Party'38 are the two fundamental conditions for the new formation of a genuine German workers' party.
The Lassalleans will now play their part themselves and devour one another, but it will be far more difficult to get rid of the South-German-republican philistine narrow-mindedness systematically drummed into the workers by Liebknecht.
Just take the stupidity of inscribing on his sheet 3 'Organ of the People's Party', i.
e.
, of the South German philistines! If Bebel only had some theoretical knowledge, something like this could not happen; he seems to me to be quite a capable fellow, who simply has this one shortcoming.
Then along comes Liebknecht and demands that we should come out on his side and that of his People's Party against Schweitzer! Whereby it is obvious that 1.
we have far less in common with the People's Party, as a bourgeois party, than we have with Schweitzer's Lassalleans, who are after all a workers' sect; and 2.
that Marx, in his capacity as Secretary of the International Working Men's Association for Germany, is obliged to treat decorously every leader whom a sufficient number of workers place at their head and elect to parliament.

10 July 1869 I would ask you from now on always to send your letters to my home address, given above.
Recently Marx sent me your study on the treatment of exanthematous disorders by means of ventilation.
In my opinion you still apply the ventilation much too moderately.
Here the window of the bedroom is kept open between 3 and 12 inches without further ado, without a screen, etc.
, and care is only taken that the patient is not lying in a direct draught—and this summer or winter.
In addition extractum carnis* and port in big doses, otherwise practically no medicine.
My servant-girl was treated thus last November for typhoid fever, and Marx's two unmarried daughters last summer for scarlet fever.
I thought that this method of treatment had long been generally adopted in Germany too but, according to your account, the old keeping-warm and stink-hole method still seems to predominate.
Hoping to hear from you soon.

14 July 1869 315 I begin with this remark because it explains the apparent apathy of our Paul.
He has not interrupted his studies, but he has neglected to take the necessary measures to pass his examinations.
To my reproaches on this subject he replied—and I must say had every right to reply—the following: 'Before I think of the future, I must occupy myself with the present.
The state of Laura's health demanded a great deal of care on my part.
It did not even permit me to be absent for any length of time.
In order not to cause anxiety to you or to my family, I wanted to conceal all this.
Laura and myself, we even did our best not to rouse the suspicions of Madame Marx.
' I have talked to a very good doctor whom Paul invited to the house.
He told me that it was absolutely necessary for Laura to go to the seaside, and he suggested Dieppe because a prolonged voyage would do her harm.
Besides, Paul has promised me that on his return from Dieppe he will do his best to cut short the time necessary to pass his doctorate.

It stands to reason that I wrote about the exchange-rate matter to you simply as our mother's business manager? But just because you are her business manager, you can't get out of it like that and tell me that I should approach mother directly about the matter.
It would be a fine state of affairs if you always resigned as business manager as soon as the other party's opinion differed from yours, or when your arguments were exhausted.
No, my lad, you've got to stick to it now.
To get to the point: what do you mean, we agreed to calculate a Jenny Marx -b F.

Engels to Hermann Engels.
15 July 1869 319 everything at 6 thalers 20 silbergroschen? Nothing more nor less than that both parties, our mother and I, should waive making an exchange profit on these £10,000.
Since, however, a considerable exchange profit has been made by mother on the £7,000 paid back by me, I felt it to be absolutely in order that I should also make my profit on the small remainder.
You solve the pattern much more simply, by claiming offhandedly that mother alone has a right to the exchange profit.
In addition, you have not considered that, in presenting mother quite correctly as the only interested party, you are sawing off the bough on which you sit with regard to the discount business.
I repay mother £1,000 and, on enquiry, receive the reply that this should be sent to R.
Funke & Co.
in bills at any sight.
I did this, and was thus entitled to have these bills credited to me at full value per date of maturity.
What Funke later did with the bills as a result of some agreement—of which I know nothing, and which is no business of mine—between R.
Funke & Co.
and Ermen & Engels, Barmen (2 firms which, as you say, do not concern me in the slightest), is no longer my concern, any more than what the bank did at which Funke discounted them.
This should now at last be clear to you.
There can be absolutely no question of 'trickery'.
But those who are merchants by profession, just like lawyers by profession, easily accustom themselves to regard the matter in hand solely from the most advantageous angle from their own point of view; when one is dealing with scientific questions this habit is the one which must be broken first.
The discount business gave me the impression that your viewpoint on this matter was not entirely unprejudiced, so I have felt since then that I should myself pay rather more attention to my own interests.
I have no recollection at all that J expressed the desire to keep the accounts in thalers for your convenience.
But you overlook the fact that your entire chain of evidence, which is based simply upon the fact the £10,000 stayed here in Manchester to my advantage, also demonstrates that, if the exchange rate had remained at 6 thalers 12 silbergroschen, I would have been obliged to remit in thalers, since nobody would wish mother to lose money on it.
And you must admit yourself what sort of value an argument has that demands that, when the rate is high, I must cover in sterling, and when low, in thalers.
I should also like to ask you, with regard to the COPS AND SEWINGS I purchased for you, whether you have charged them to mother at the current exchange or at 6 thalers 20 silbergroschen, although I 320 224.
Engels to Hermann Engels.
15 July 1869 do not doubt at the former, in view of your zeal for mother's profit on the exchange rate.
But that's enough.
As your patience appears to be coming to an end, and the matter is not worth the trouble, I'll oblige you and cover in sterling.
Under my agreement with Gottfried,3 the sum of £1,000 is payable on 1 August, and then every 2 months, and I shall devote the first instalments, as far as possible, to cover mother.
It is, however, probable that Gottfried will hold back the first instalment until the accounts are completed and the contracts signed, which could take 14 days longer, so I would ask you not to depend on it as a certainty and to the day.
Be so good, therefore, as to send me my current account, made up as of 30 June; my account here is so lengthy, as a result of many money withdrawals, that I would prefer not to depend upon it, since I have not yet received my statement, and can only check it superficially in the office.
The whole approximate balance you will receive: 1.
in August circa £800-900, 2.
in October £1,000, and in De­ cember— the remainder; I would request you to let me know in good time where and how you would like the remittances.
Your letter of the 13th just arrived; I shall sign the thing as soon as I go to town and meet the vice-consul, probably tomorrow.
But be so kind as to enquire what I should do in order to be spared any further communications from the Royal District Court in Bochum with regard to the Vereinigte 13 Engelsburg.
From time to time a fat epistle arrives here, written on heavy, poor-quality scribbling paper, with a seal as big as a two-thaler piece, addressed to me as 'Official Business, Post Free'; whereupon the English Post Office, which doesn't give a damn for the District Court of Bochum, charges me between 3 and 5s.
postage.
A week ago I received a packet like this, with the names of all the shareholders in the Vereinigte Engelsburg and the draft of the amalgamation, and the request that I should make my declaration on it.
I learned from this that I may some day have the pleasure of possessing 3 mining shares divided by 8, but feel that it is a little too 672 ö 7 dear to pay 4s.
8d.
postage for this information.
If I could only read the name of the worthy district judge appended to this, I would write him a very polite epistle, praying him to leave me in peace with the Vereinigte Engelsburg; but the Prussian officials purposely write their signatures so illegibly, in order to avoid the danger of receiving replies.
Be so good as to inform this illegible Gottfried Ermen -h United 224.
Engels to Hermann Engels.
15 July 1869 321 gentleman that the unstamped post of the Dortmund and Bochum District Court is not recognised here and that I'll be grateful to him, if he, in accordance with the power of attorney, sends all communications to mother.
The situation with the firm is this: Gottfried attaches importance to keeping it as long as you keep it, since otherwise you would have been able to take over part of the legacy of Ermen & Engels, Manchester.
I regarded it as not only superfluous, but also harmful, for me to interfere on your behalf, since you had 1.
P.
a Ermen's promise, which covers you here, and 2.
the expert opinion of the lawyers, which I took for gospel truth.
For as long as P.
Ermen lives you are safe from G.
Ermen; had I known that your rights were not quite bomb-proof, I would certainly have avoided drawing Gottfried's attention to this by making proposals; and G.
Ermen would not have entered into an engagement not to challenge your rights after P.
Ermen's death.
Meanwhile we have him in our hands, because I have given him the rights of the firm for only 5 years, and although I promised him that after that period I would make no difficulties for him, this depends, together for instance with my discretion about business secrets, completely upon his conduct, particularly vis-à-vis yourselves, and I have made this plain to him.
On the £10,000 that I have already invested in shares, I had earned at least £170 net in market appreciation by 30 June.
They bring me in an average of 57/s% of my investment capital.
They are mostly gas, WATERWORKS and railway shares, all English com­ panies.
My freedom pleases me more and more from day to day.
Unfortunately, I have still too much running about to do to be able to start any particularly thorough studies, but this will soon be settled.
I have spoken about the COPS with Schuncks' buyer, and have sent him a memorandum, a copy of which I enclose for your use.
With regard to the SEWINGS, the qualities have changed so much since my last purchases that it would be best for you to order them from samples if you still need some.
Likewise with the COPS, it would be best for you to bind Schuncks to the yarns named in the memorandum; they are those we have been using here for 20 years, and they are indispensable for you as long as they don't change the quality.

With you too? Enclosed a mass of stuff from Eichhoff, Wilhelm, 3 Fritzsche.
391 Dear old Wilhelm —as always happily disposing of what is not his—naturally refers Fritzsche to me, in order to touch the TRADES UNIONS here for £300, and he guarantees repayment! And quite pointlessly puts me in the embarrassing position of having to turn down Fritzsche! In addition, he doesn't even seem to read properly the letters sent him.
I sent him 900 cards and told him the annual subscription was Id.
per card.
Of these 900, I placed 500 gratis at his DISPOSITION, so the fellows would at least be eligible for representation at the congress.
379 And now he asks me whether fixed annual dues must be paid.
The tough conditions under which Schweitzer returned to the bosom of Hatzfeldt are shown very vividly by the fact that he has been forced to allow Mende to start a row with the Internation­ al S92 in the Social-Demokrat.
He himself knows best how dangerous this operation is for him! a Wilhelm Liebknecht 226.

Many thanks for what you sent.

0 If Schweitzer attacks the International, we should consider whether to oblige him.
Frightful muck is developing as the Lassallean swindle putrefies.
Fritzsche wanted 1,800 thalers from Schweitzer and, when he turned him down, then you should get him 3,000 thalers.
The fellow is obviously just as big a blackguard as Schweitzer.
From the beginning, Lassalle introduced venality, and this has grown.
But where did Schweitzer get the money from, if not the Prussians? The calm assumption that the English workers should provide £450 for Fritzsche, even before he and his consorts have joined the IWA, is really good.
I truly believe that Wilhelm absolutely incited Fritzsche to saddle you with himself.

How dare Wilhelm assure Schweitzer publicly that'the General Council of the IWA' takes exactly the same attitude to the said Schweitzer as he, Wilhelm does? 395 This is rather much, particular­ ly if, as I assume, he did so without your permission.
That Schweitzer has lost a lot of support among the masses is shown by the fact that he has not dared to proclaim the voting figures.

21 July 1869 325 Wilhelm is betraying the workers to the bourgeois democrats; Wilhelm is taking care not to answer both points, and altogether he appears even more incapable than usual in this polemic.
How absurd, for instance, just at the moment, to reprint from Schwaben-mayer's" Demokratische Correspondenz the glorification of the bourgeois American Republic because of the Pacific Railway .
b And how can Wilhelm announce to Schweitzer that he will be shown the door at the Basle Congress 379? Monsieur Bonaparte appears to have gone right out of his mind.
One cropper after another.
First his message with its apparent concessions, then the sudden adjournment, now this droll ministry.
388 If he had set out to show even the stupidest Frenchman that he wants to expose France to worldwide derision, he couldn't have done it better.
This is just the way to shake the confidence his majority, his ministers and prefects, his judges and officers have in him.
And since all the loyalty has been purchased and was conditional on his future success, they will desert him much earlier than the Senate and Corps législatif deserted the old Napoleon in 1814 and 1815.

Here the balancing of accounts is dragging on.
Yesterday they said at least 14 days, which I translate as: at least 3 weeks.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck here until about 20 August.

22 July 1869 228 MARX TO ENGELS 398 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 22 July 1869 DEAR FRED, Wilhelm really has colossal impudence, issuing bulls of excom­ munication on behalf of the General Council of the International.
3 I had written to him that I, personally, was keeping myself out of this scandal399 (Hatzfeldt, the old trollop, would like nothing better than to drag me in), particularly since I am just as decidedly against the Lassalle clique as against the People's Party.
I added that Wilhelm could give notice (to Schweitzer) that (in accordance with the resolutions of the Brussels Congress) only real members will be admitted at Basle.
And this he did in a paragraph in the issue before last.
400 After soliciting me in vain to take official steps against Schweitzer, he has had the impudence to involve me in this scandal! I wrote him an extremely rude letter immediately upon receipt of the last Wochenblatt ,b in which I reminded him how often he had already compromised me, and declared frankly that I would publicly disavow him as soon as he showed such impudence again.
401 (Impudence which, in addition, is a lie, since the General Council has never discussed the Schweitzer affair, etc.
, let alone passed a resolution.
) It depends on how Schweitzer, who has been badly provoked, now acts.
I shall 'cast off Mr Wilhelm if he should get me caught up in dirty work for the third time.
The fellow does not even have the excuse that he marches with us through thick and thin.
He commits his stupidities on his own behalf, betrays us when he sees fit, and identifies us with him as soon as he sees no other way out.
For about 6 days now I have had a large carbuncle on my left arm which, in 'this heat', is not pleasant.
I have another 'family' unpleasantness.
I have noticed for some time that my wife was not able to manage on the money I give her every week, although there has been no increase in expenditure.

And the daftness of females then emerged.
In the list of debts she had made me for youa she had suppressed ABOUT £~75, which she was now trying to pay back BY AND BY out of the housekeeping money.
Why, I asked? Reply: she would have been afraid to admit to the full sum! Females obviously need to be under constant tutelage! Jennychen returned yesterday.
Although half a year has passed now, Mrs Monroe has not yet paid her.
The Scots hold tight to their CASH! 371 I don't know what to do about the journey.
You know that my only aim in this business is to provide Jennychen with the recreation that is practically indispensable for her.
But Kugel-mann's illness has changed everything.
I would not go to Karlsbad 13 to be his comrade-in-sickness, even if I had needed the trip for myself.
And now to leave the child as companion with Frau Kugelmann.
394 Nothing at all can come of this.
I expect you will write to tell me your opinion.
Mr Schweitzer's discovery that the Geneva committee consists mainly of workers is good!392 Bakunin and Schweitzer state councillors! Bonaparte's rickety ways will soon lead to defections amongst his generals.
Between Prussia and Russia there is a row that does not seem completely 'play-acting'.

The thing is in full suppuration, so very painful, but will also soon be over.
The swilling of arsenic will have to begin again.
This morning I received the enclosed screed from Liebknecht.
404 Which is the more extraordinary, the stupid impudence or the impudent stupidity? This honest fellow regards official lies, such as that about non-existent resolutions of the General Council, as permissible in his own mouth, but as highly reprehensible in Schweitzer's.
And why did he achieve a reconciliation with Schweitzer the Monster in Lausanne? And his theory of action! This consists of giving Mr Wilhelm the right to make 'arbitrary' use of my name and that of the General Council wherever he considers appropriate.
And the courage of this honest fellow! He claims to be against Lassalle, and so takes the part of the 'true' Lassalleans against the 'false' Lassalleans! Bracke, his man, after all accuses Schweitzer of declaring Lassalle's theory of state credit to be simply an agitational tool, and of not believing in panacea.
He had involved me in 'battles'! In 'scandals', I wrote to him.

25 July 1869 would certainly be a rather doleful cure-companion in Karlsbad.
Since I shall not be free before 15-20 August in any case, it would be madness for us to consider anything combined.
If I should be free earlier, we can still see what can be done.
I should certainly come to serious grips with Mrs Monroe.
Jenny should go to her and tell her frankly that she needs the CASH.
Perhaps Mrs Monroe is waiting to receive a formal bill: MRS MONROE TO MISS MARX.

And if Jenny's visit does not help, I would, in your place, write a polite but firm letter.
You have to show these Scots that you know what BUSINESS is, and they then respect you all the more.
The impudence of old Wilhelm exceeds the possible.
3 Trying to convince you that, with his lying, he had remained 'within the bounds of your letter'! Just how lazy his conscience is in this connection is shown by the fact that he uses the phrase 'take into consideration' which he otherwise abhors, and by his closing, touching appeal to your good heart.
The simpleton demands that we and the whole International should undergo all his metamorphoses in re Schweitzer, concluding peace when he concludes peace, thrashing Schweitzer when he thrashes him, and allowing him to lie to his heart's content in the name of the International whenever he thinks it 'necessary'.
And he wants to prescribe to the Congress11 who should be admitted and who not.
Also rather strong that, in the Vogt business 407 he has left the defence 'up to you!' and this 'for the sake of the Party'.
He really takes himself what might be called seriously.
And how lame is the business with the factory inspectors! The government has flatly decided to introduce them, but Liebknecht has prevented this, naturally in the interests of the workers, so that they shall not be bribed by them.
Bismarck prevented by Liebknecht! Quite something! Not to mention the craftiness of such a policy.
The 18th Brumaire received yesterday with thanks.
The book reads much better in a decent binding and without the misprints.
The introduction is very good.
This, and the book itself, will bring Wilhelm no pleasure.
The manner in which democracy, and even more Social-Democracy, is treated is by no means grist to his mill, but rather on his head.
Incidentally, he can no longer say he has no agitational material: we shall see what he does with it.

Engels to Marx.
25 July 1869 331 Mr Senior (1843-58).
Some FACTS and a few nice admissions, but generally only of special interest because they are stated by such a 'respectable' man.
Therefore valuable for me, 2 volumes, 1868.
I don't think there will be anything new in it for you.
408 If Schweitzer had not got such a bad conscience, and if he had not committed the stupidity recently of threatening the Internation­ al, then he would certainly have responded to Liebknecht's bull of excommunication395 ; he would have challenged the General Council on the question and then you would have had to disavow Monsieur Wilhelm.
Instead of excommunicating Schweitzer in the name of the IWA, why does Wilhelm not grab Schweitzer because of this threat, and with this help put the General Council in a position in which it must say something in response to Schweitzer's threat? The fellow really is too clumsy.
The business with Bracke is also good.
403 These Lassallean menials are always shouting for money, just money.
In my opinion, it would be very ill-advised of the IWA to send the Germans even one pfennig before they have paid regular dues for a period.
The demoralisation that has prevailed since Lassalle and through him must be firmly removed.
Enclosed Kugelmann and Wilhelm returned.
You will certainly be writing to Kugelmann yourself about your journey.
Send me back Kugelmann's letter so that I can reply to him; without a bit of medical chat he won't release me.
Tussy is reading Götz von Berlichingen, and afterwards I'll give her Egmont? Walks have almost ceased in this heat; today it will be somewhat cooler.

You will see that OLD Becker3 cannot give up making himself important.
409 With his language group system he casts aside our whole Rules and the spirit of the statute, and alters our organic system into an artificial construction of arbitrary language relations instead of real state and national relations.
Extremely reactionary business, fitting for the pan-Slavists! And all this because we allowed him provisionally to remain the centre for his former correspondents, until the 'International' in Germany gets stronger.
I immediately put a spoke in his wheel when he attempted at the Eisenach Congress37' to promote himself as centre for Germany.
Bebel has sent me 25 thalers for the Belgians from his Workers' Educational Association.
410 Today I ACKNOWLEDGED this gift, and took the opportunity to write to him about Becker's fantasy plans.
I drew his attention to Article 6 of the Rules,h which only recognises national central committees in direct contact with the General Council and, where this is impossible because of the police, obliges the local groups in each country to correspond directly with the General Council.
I explained to him the absurdity of Becker's pretensions and finally stated that if the Eisenach Congress—quoadc THE INTERNATIONAL—accepted Becker's suggestion, we would immediately and publicly quash it as contrary to the Rules.
Incidentally Bebel and Liebknecht had written to me earlier, SPONTANEOUSLY, that they had written to Becker telling him they did not recognise him but corresponded directly with London.
Becker himself is not dangerous.
But, as we have been informed from Switzerland, his secretary Remy was pressed upon him by Mr Bakunin and is Bakunin's TOOL.

30 July 1869 335 234 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 30 July 1869 Dear Moor, Old Becker must have gone completely off his head.
How can he decree that the TRADES UNION must be the real workers' association and the basis of all organisation, that the other associations must only exist provisionally alongside, etc.
409 And all in a country where real TRADES UNIONS still do not yet even exist.
And what a complicated 'organisation'.
On the one hand each TRADE centralises itself in a national leadership, on the other hand the various TRADES in each locality centralise themselves again in a local leadership.
If one wanted to make the eternal squabbling permanent, this would be the arrangement to adopt.
But it is au fond 3 nothing but the old German journeyman's desire to preserve his 'inn' in every town, and takes this to be the unity of the workers' organisation.
If many more such proposals come to light, the time at the Eisenach Congress 373 will be nicely debated away.
The international plans have naturally no other purpose than to ensure the leadership for Becker as far as the German tongue is heard (he has already annexed Mulhause in Alsace, see Vorbote, p.
109 under 'Basle').
In practice this fine organisation, with its leadership in Geneva, must come to grief on the German laws, since Becker has, as usual, made out the bill without the waiter.
Generalising the idea of central committees based upon language, in other words putting the Genevan workers under Paris and the Antwerpers under Amsterdam (if Geneva is not intended to rule the whole of France and Walloon-Belgium, which those in free Geneva have very probably assumed), is presumably only designed to strengthen his claim to regency over the German language.
15 But it is very good that the Eisenach Congress and not the international Basle Congress379 should settle these matters.
Incidentally, I would never claim to have understood Becker's plan properly; given the German and the logic which rule there, sense and understanding come to a complete stop.
It's quite clear that fat Bakunin is behind it.

30 July 1869 Russian really thinks of intriguing his way to the top of the workers' movement, then the time has come to give him once and for all what he deserves and ask the question whether a pan-Slavist can be a member of an international workers' association.
The fellow can very easily be tackled.
He should not imagine that he can play a cosmopolitan communist for the workers, and a burning national pan-Slavist for the Russians.
A few hints to Borkheim, who is just dealing with him now, would be quite in order; Borkheim will undoubtedly understand a broad hint.
You will have seen that the worthy Swiss want to have 'direct legislation by the people'413 discussed at the congress.
That will be nice.
It really is a disgrace that after nearly 40 years of political workers' movement in England, the only workers' paper3 in existence can be bought up by a bourgeois like S.
Morley.
b But unfortunately it appears to be a law of the proletarian movement that everywhere a part of the workers' leaders necessarily become corrupted, though it has happened nowhere else in the general fashion to which Lassalle developed it in Germany.
Tussy is now reading Firdusi' in the very good version by Schack; so far she likes it very much, but whether she will work right through the enormous volume is something different.

So if you want to make a plan for a journey, then make it and let me know; we could meet somewhere in Germany or in Holland too if you like, or we could leave London together.

This is not, however, the reason that so far I have delayed my reply to your letter of 17 inst.
Since I would certainly not like to clash with your plans, and since I am personally interested in enjoying your company, I have taken various steps in order to arrange things in your sense.
But this is positively impossible.
I must be in Holland at the end of August with my relatives," where all sorts of matters of interest and importance to me have to be settled.
My proposal to transfer this rendezvous to another date has been turned down flatly, as the people whom I am meeting are all tied up by their business, and only have a certain time free for the meeting in Bommel.
b I shall, therefore, be leaving London at the end of August.
349 You should write and tell me when you will be back in Hanover.
I shall then see to what extent I can adjust my further PROGRESS accordingly.

If I visited him before he went to Karlsbad,3 he would move heaven and earth to take me with him to this boring and expensive place—or I would hinder him in carrying out his own plan, which he must carry out for the sake of his health.
I have therefore written to himb that I must go to Holland on family business at the end of August, and from there I would perhaps have the opportunity to see him in Hanover after his return.
I really knew no other way of arranging things.
Other reasons for delaying the journey: Firstly: the Lafargue FAMILY may be coming to London soon.
Secondly: If I left here now, the General Council would be completely at a loss with the necessary work with regard to the Basle Congress.

Since, as Tussy tells me, Jenny has September free too, you can of course postpone your journey until that month.
I always thought that, because of Jenny, you were limited to only four weeks during which you had to travel.
The row between Schweitzer and the Leipzig people is getting jolly.
The accusations that Bebel has been bribed by the Guelphs, and the threat of the Schweitzerians that they will impose their victory upon the congress by muscle power, point to a fine show.
How stupid it was of Wilhelm to allow Goegg to be co-signatory of his congress manifesto, and thus expose himself to the attacks of the Social-Demokrat.

The part of Wilhelm's speech (delivered in Berlinc ) printed in the supplement demonstrates, beneath the stupidity, an undeni­ able cunning in arranging the affair suitably.
By the way, this is very nice.
Since the Reichstag may only be utilised as a means of agitation, one may never agitate there for something sensible and directly affecting the workers' interests! The worthy Wilhelm's illusion that, since Bismarck 'is fond of turns of speech friendly to the workers, he would not oppose real workers' measures is REALLY CHARMING! 'AS though'—as Bruno Bauer would say—Mr Wagener would not declare himself theoretically in the Reichstag in favour of the Factory Acts, but in practice against them 'since they would be useless under Prussian conditions'! 'As though' Mr Bismarck, if he really would and could do something for the workers, would not force the implementation of the existing legislation in Prussia itself] Merely because this occurred in Prussia, liberal'Saxony'etc.
would have to follow.
What Wilhelm does not grasp is that the present governments flirt with the workers, but know full well that their only support lies with the bourgeoisie, and that they therefore scare the latter with phrases friendly to the workers, but are never really able to take steps against the bourgeoisie.
The brute believes in the future 'state of democracy'! Secretly that means sometimes constitutional England, sometimes the bourgeois United States, sometimes wretched Switzerland.
'It' has no conception of revolutionary politics.
Copying Schwabenmayer ,d he quotes as proof of democratic activity: the railway to California was built by the bourgeoisie awarding itself through Congress an a paper damaged -b 'Be this as it may, today one is aware that it depends upon the League to bring the life of society to a halt at that moment when it intends stopping everything with one word.
If an ambitious minister were to be found who knew how to win their good graces, it may be understood what he would be able to undertake against rivals uncomfortable to him.
We are perfectly convinced that this same minister, his goal once achieved, would find nothing more urgent to do than to take radical measures to destroy the League; we do not know whether he would be successful; but at present we declare that the International League is, in truth, the universal dictatorship.

12 August 1869 345 241 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 12 August 1869 Dear Moor, I have cut the Gordian knot regarding Schnaps 3 by simply informing Tussy of the FACT; whether this has plunged her into a natural conflict I do not know.
Unfortunately, however, she now has something else to do, for, since last Friday, she has continuously had horrible toothache in the same tooth that gave her a lot of trouble earlier.
So far she has borne the thing with astonishing heroism, but shortened sleep and the long nervous tension have had an effect, and today she looks somewhat exhausted.
She said you didn't want the tooth to be pulled out; but I sent her today, since things could not continue thus, together with Lizzie to one of the leading dentists here, and told her she should submit to his judgement.
After a long examination he said he hoped to save the tooth, but if the pain did not cease by Saturday morning, the tooth would have to come out.
At all events, the child cannot stand this constant and nerve-racking pain every 6 months; her general health suffers far more from this than the whole tooth is worth.
But I think I shall soon be able to give better news.
I must just call in at the Schiller Society,76 and see what has happened in Eisenach.
373 On Saturday the two parties seem to have parted in peace, so they have at least avoided general fisticuffs.
The stupidity and meanness of the Urquhartites is demonstrated by the fact that they never mention: A RESIDENCE Z.

The thing is written in a very lively and graphic style, and is worth more than any other book I know on the subject.

But they can see.
They arrived—at least Brophy did—as friends of the Christians, and changed their views completely in favour of the Turks.
But since they also find their blind-spots in the Turkish governmental system (though here, too, they have something in common with Urquhart), the Urquhartites are not allowed to mention a book that is worth more than their entire Free Press, even from their own point of view.
The FACTS in it are worth more to me than all the chatter by the Urquhartites, and SHORT-ARMED Collet can envy the two their description of Russian and French policy in Constantinople.

420 The sending of Applegarth by his own Union will show to the continentals that the English workmen are not so indifferent in regard to the International as their ill-wishers say.
It is only a pity that Applegarth does not even take part at our present discussions, so as to be able to represent our views.

Since I must now wait for a letter from home providing me with more detailed information and since yet another reason requires that I still be here tomorrow, I telegraphed you today that I will not be coming until Wednesday.
b Also, I am worried that if in the meantime the Laf argues should come I may not find night quarters in your doubtless full house and, this being the case, would like to know whether I might find lodging somewhere near you.
Tussy's tooth is out; the dentist found that since one of the three roots was inflamed the only solution was to extract.

Don't forget, either, to take a TICKET only to KENTISH TOWN STATION (just near us), or, if you take it to ST.

Mr Lafargue, in principle, never announces the day of his arrival, on the basis that anxiety will thus be avoided should chance delays occur.

This evening the Lafargue FAMILY arrives, leaving Dieppe today at 10 o'clock.
The £10 received, but can't send RECEIPT before Saturday,1 on which day there is a meeting of the sub-committee.
The money is very welcome just before closing time.
b Yesterday Dupont announced that the French (or Paris) TRADES UNIONISTS (BRONZE WORKERS) had paid back £45, i.
e.
, sent it to him to pay back.
422 This money was partly loaned and partly given to them years ago by the UNIONS here through our mediation.
(Even earlier, £20 was sent on our instructions from Paris to Rouen.
) I have arranged that deputes shall wait upon the UNIONS here to appeal to their consciences when they pay in the money.
— Incidentally, the Paris UNIONISTS have behaved very decently.
Ditto, a letter arrived yesterday from Ludwig Neumayr, de dato Eisenach, with the following purport 423: 'At the congress in Eisenach, it was resolved that the workers of Germany should be called upon to join the International Working Men's Association by taking out cards as central members.
Since I have now been appointed by Joh.
Ph.
Becker in Geneva as the agent of the German-language sectional groups of the International Working Men's Association for Wiener-Neustadt and surroundings, I would request exact instructions as to how I should now act.
With social-republican fraternal greetings, etc.
Address: Ludwig Neumayr, editor of the Wiener-Neustädter Wochenblatt in Wiener-Neustadt, Austria.
' This is a blow to OLD Becker and also, in particular, to the 'language-group cash-box'.
But the matter itself may not be mucked about because of private friendship.
You will recall Werner (bookbinder) of Leipzig, to whom I wrote from Manchester.
Since then he has worked for us diligently.
Yesterday the adherence of an (Italian) group from Trieste arrived.
Ditto from Barcelona; I enclose a COPY of the organc of this new group.
In Posen —as Zabicki reported—the Polish workers (joiners, etc.
) have victoriously ended a STRIKE with the assistance of their colleagues in Berlin.
424 This struggle against Monsieur le Capital— even in the minor form of a STRIKE—will deal with national prejudice differently from the peace declamations made by bourgeois gentlemen.

15 in the morning, found a train going here at 7.
30, and journeyed on through, since I had scarcely slept all night, and was good for nothing else.
I also thought you were away with Jenny, and only here heard the contrary.
This delay in your departure looks a little queer to me; I can't think that the Basle Congress379 is alone to blame, and I am forced to ask myself whether it is not a money matter.
When you asked for the £75 I sent you 100, imagining you could use the rest for the journey; since, however, I did not state this in so many words, you perhaps found another use for it; if this is so, telegraph me tomorrow morning (before 10 o'clock if possible), saying how much you need.
We shall, you see, be leaving for Dublin tomorrow evening,421 and I shall be going into town around 11-12 to look after money matters, so I could deal with this at the same time.

5 September 1869 I was in Engelskirchen 418 for a few days.
People in Germany are becoming increasingly stupid.
It is true that the workers' movement is closing in upon them threateningly, and they all flirt with it and have NOSTRUMS of all sorts, but their intelligence has not become any sharper; the opposite is true.
My brother," for instance, wanted to solve the social problem by 'redeeming labour', just as he redeems factory installations, buildings, machinery etc.
, by, for instance, putting a groschen on the price of each pound of yarn, and thus paying off the workers who have become old, sick and disabled! The bonhomme h was very surprised when I explained to him how hopelessly naive and absurd this idea was, and he finally promised to read your book/ Concerning the Prussian journeymen's provident funds, he gave me an article in Engel's statistical journal; the most blatant infamies of the statutes of Saxony are not present there, but otherwise everything similar.
425 The greatest man in Germany is undoubtedly Strousberg.
The fellow will soon become German Kaiser.
Everywhere you go people talk of nothing but Strousberg.
Incidentally, the fellow is not as bad as all that.
My brother, who had negotiations with him, has described him very vividly to me.
He has a lot of humour and some brilliant qualities, and, in any case, is immeasurably superior to Hudson the RAILWAY KING.
He is now buying up all sorts of industrial establishments, and immediately cuts the working time to 10 hours everywhere, without reducing wages.
He also has the clear knowledge that he will end up a really poor wretch.
His main principle is: only swindle share-holders, but deal fairly with contractors and other industrialists.
In Cologne I saw his portrait on exhibition; not bad at all, jovial.
His background is completely dark; some say he is a qualified lawyer; according to others he kept a brothel in London.
Wilhelmchend has now fallen so low that he may no longer say that Lassalle cribbed from you, and wrongly at that.
This has emasculated the whole biography, and only he can know why he 49fi continues to print it.
And he has declared the miserable Felleisen, not even the Vorbote, the journal of the bumpkins in Switzerland.
427 They are a fine bunch.
Cf.
the debate about social-democratic, democratic-social, or social-democratic + democratic-social workers' party at the Eisenach Congress.
And Rittinghausen their prophet! 428 Wilhelm still makes no mention of the 18th Brumaire.
Here, too, a probably Rudolf Engels -b honest fellow -c the first volume of Capital -d Wilhelm Liebknecht 248.

Published in English tor the first Stuttgart, 1913 and in ful in MEGA, • 6 248 MARX TO ENGELS 33 IN MANCHESTER Hanover, 25 September 1869 Dear FRED, I had two unpleasant pieces of news from home today.
Little Schnappy'1 is in a very bad way, and during our short absence has lost 1 l/2 pounds.
Kugelmann insists—and is writing in this sense to London today—that Dr West in London, a famous children's doctor and, he believes, professor at Lafargue's hospital (St Bartholomew's) should be consulted.
Second, Laura is again IN INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCES, which is equally bad luck for herself and for Lafargue.
We have been here for 8 days.
We stayed for several days in Belgium (Bruges and Liège), then on to Cologne.
From there a visit to Dietzgen the thinker in Siegburg.
From there to Bonn, and from there by steamer to Mainz.
This journey delighted Jen­ nychen.
Unfortunately, afflicted by an importunate guest.
In Bonn I had paid a call on Hagen in the evening.
Not at home.
Appeared next morning at the moment of our departure.
Announcing that he a Charles Etienne Lafargue 354 248.
Marx to Engels.
25 September 1869 would accompany us to Rolandseck, we were saddled with him until Mainz.
In Mainz we spent one day with Stumpf, who has a most delightful family (daughter and sister).
Used the opportunity for a side trip to Wiesbaden.
Omitted Ems.
One day in Aachen with Karl Philips.
During this tour through Belgium, stay in Aachen, and journey up the Rhine, I convinced myself that energetic action must be taken against the clerics, particularly in the Catholic areas.
I shall work in this vein in the International.
Where it appears suitable, the rogues are flirting with workers' problems (e.
g.
, Bishop Ketteler in Mainz, the clerics at the Düsseldorf Congress, etc.
).
In fact we worked for them in 1848, but they enjoyed the fruits of the revolution during the period of reaction.
Everywhere I went people knew nothing about my Louis Bonaparte.
On this point I sent Meissner a note that was by no means courteous.
He has not so far replied.
430 Liebknecht has written to me again about your Peasant War* which is to be printed as a propaganda piece.
As, this time, the thing is appearing under the auspices of the Eisenach Central Authority, I would advise you to make the necessary corrections, and to send the thing in without delay.
431 Since I shall probably have a rendezvous with Wilhelm in a few days, b write to me by return about your INTENTIONS.
Feuerbach has written to Kapp in New York in a sense similar— mutatis mutandis—to that in which Ruge c wrote about my book,d and Kapp for his part has informed our Meyer e in St Louis about the matter.
Jennychen has still not received an ordre de retour 1 from her EMPLOYERS.
8 The business is unpleasant.
On the one hand, it is difficult to get away from here quickly.
On the other, the CHANGE does the child a lot of good.
She is looking really splendid.
Heartiest greetings to MRS Burns and Tussychen.

432 Du bist beslôzen In minem Herzen.
I was happy to see from Möhmchen's d letter (written in her usual amusing way, she is a real virtuoso in letter-writing) that your health is improving.
Our dear little Schnappy, e I hope, will soon get better.
At the same time, I fully share Kugelmann's opinion that Dr West ought to be consulted at once (or another medical man if he be absent).
I trust you and Lafargue will in this case yield to my paternal authority, a thing, you know full well, I am not in the habit of appealing to.
Nobody is more difficult to treat than a baby.
In no case more immediate action is wanted, and any delay more hurtful.
You must under no circumstances accelerate your departure from London.
It would be really dangerous to the child and do no good to yourself.
On this point, every medical man will give you the same advice.
I am glad the Basle Congress379 is over, and has, comparatively speaking, passed off so well.
I am always fretting on such occasions of public exhibition of the party 'mit allen ihren Geschwüren'.
1 None of the actors was à la hauteur des principes, 8 but the higher class idiocy effaces the working class blunders.
We have passed through no little German town the Winkelblatt h of which was not full of the doings of 'that formidable Congress'.
We are here in a sort of fix.
The Kugelmanns will not hear of an early leave-taking.
At the same time, Jenny is much improving in health consequent upon the change of air and circumstances.
With Liebknecht I am likely to meet, within a few days, at Brunswick.
I decline going to Leipzig, and he cannot come to a Laura's nickname used by her family -b Marx's nickname used by his family -c Thou art enclosed in mine heart (Middle-High German).

So I shall go through the piece right away.
Incidentally, Wilhelm can write to me himself about it; he still has not replied to my last letter, and I don't see why I should make advances to him.

This profit has to be brought into the pockets of the LANDLORDS.
Mr Trench, in return, is nicely checked by his own statements to Senior, which the latter has had published.
11 Trench tells the liberal Senior that, were he an Irish peasant, he too would be a RlBBONMAN436! I would have visited Dietzgen from Engelskirchen, 418 but the highway to Siegburg had just been washed away and communica­ tions almost broken off.
Can't Jenny write to the Monroes, I should have thought the matter could be arranged.
b Ireland's trade has grown enormously over the last 14 years.
Dublin port was unrecognisable.
On Queenstown Quay I heard a great deal of Italian, then Serbian, French and Danish or Norwegian.
THERE ARE INDEED A GOOD MANY 'ITALIANS' IN CORK, as the comedy has it.
The country itself really looks depopulated, however, and you immediately get the idea that there are far too few people.
Everywhere you are faced by the state of war.
The ROYAL IRISH rush about everywhere in squads, with sheath-knives and sometimes revolvers at their belts, and unsheathed police batons in their hands; in Dublin a horse-drawn battery drove right through the centre of town, something I have never seen in England, and there are soldiers literally everywhere.
The worst thing about the Irish is that they become CORRUPTIBLE as soon as they cease to be peasants and fall into bourgeois ways.
Of course this is true of most peasant nations.
But in Ireland it's particularly bad, so the press is also particularly scurvy.
Moore is in the Tyrol; will probably return next week.
I expect you'll be going to Hamburg and seeing Meissner.
437 IF so, you may mention to him that I am working on something about Ireland, and will offer it to him in due time.

Better news today from London on Schnappy's health.
a Laura and Lafargue intend to leave London as soon as the little one's condition makes it possible.
Under these circumstances, Tussy's IMMEDIATE RETURN to London appears necessary.
Laura will hold it against her very much if she should leave for Paris without Tussy attempting to see the Lafargue family first.
I have just gossiped away an hour with a deputation of 4 Lassalleans sent to me by the local branch of the German General Workers' Association.
104 I naturally conducted myself with great reserve and diplomacy, but sub rosah I informed the people of the necessary.
439 We parted good friends.
I naturally rejected their invitation—extended in the name of the Association—to lecture to them.
On Sunday another delegation arrives from Brunswick: Bracke, Bonhorst, Spier.
440 This is less agreeable to me.

In German we use the word 'Process' (procès) for economical movements, as you say chemical procès, si je ne me trompe pas.
h He translates by 'phenomena' which is nonsense.
If he can find no other word, he must always translate by 'mouvement' or something analogous.

I have been sent from St Petersburg a thick 500-page Flerovsky volume on the condition of the Russian peasants and workers.
443 Unfortunately in Russian.
The fellow worked on the book for 15 years.
The great Bakunin is now off to Naples, as DELEGATE to an atheists' congress being held there in opposition to the oecumeni­ cal consilium.

I was happy to discover the Wakefielda here in my SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY—that is to say, in the catalogue, for in reality it was not to be found.
They are trying to track it down; I shall write to you about it again.
It consists of 2 fat quarto volumes.
In fact, I find that quite a number of the things I have here are very useful, particularly for the 1500-1800 period, and some very important, so if Wakefield comes to light and Youngb can be flushed out, I would need virtually only quite modern things.

—you will probably need Gaudissartb ; for although one can learn enough Russian in 3 months to read such a book, you have no time for this at the moment.
Let Gaudissart look at it, and if it is worth something, I may be able to read myself to some extent into Russian again with it, as soon as I am finished with Ireland.
From Ireland to Russia il n'y a qu'un pas.
c Enclosed envelope of your 2nd letter from Hanover,d which shows signs of Prussian attention, though I fail to grasp how the people found the time, since you only posted the letter 10 minutes before the close of post.
Between then and the time when the train left, however, they may have found the time for a tête-à-tête.
Irish history shows what a misfortune it is for one nation to subjugate another.
All English abominations have their origin in the Irish PALE.
445 I still have to bone up on the Cromwellian period, but it appears clear to me that things in England would have taken another turn but for the necessity of military rule in Ireland and creating a new aristocracy.

30 October 1869 terms right to the end, should immediately have seized his papers, is an unnatural discovery.
448 Apropos.
The secretary3 of our French Genevan committeeb is utterly fed up with being saddled with Bakunin, and complains that he disorganises everything with his 'tyranny'.
In the Égalité, Monsieur Bakunin indicates that the German and English workers have no desire for individuality, so accept our communisme autoritaire.
In opposition to this, Bakunin represents le collectivis­ me anar chique.
" The anarchism is, however, in his head, which contains only one clear idea—that Bakunin should play first fiddle.
For a complete understanding of Goegg's and Bonhorst's letters, you should know that the bumpkins' (or rather their representatives') party in Switzerland, Austria and Germany, are screaming blue murder about the resolution of the Basle Congress on propriété foncière.
0 The foolishness and weakness (exploited by the cleverer Schweitzer) with which Wilhelm and his consorts reply to the howls by Schwabenmayer e and the rest of their anti-People's Party supporters, 449 make one's hair stand on end.
It has not even occurred to one of these jackasses to ask the liberal howlers if there does not, perhaps, exist in Germany, side by side with small peasant property, also large landed property, which forms the basis of the surviving feudal economy; whether it will not be necessary to put an end to this in the course of a revolution, if only to put an end to the present economy of the state; and whether this can be done in the antiquated manner of 1789450 ? Quod non} The jackasses believe Schwabenmayer's statement that the land question is only of direct practical interest for England! The creation of the LAND AND LABOUR League*51 (incidentally, directly inspired by the General Council) should be regarded as an outcome of the Basle Congress379; here, the workers' party makes a clean break with the bourgeoisie, NATIONALISATION OF LAND [being] the STARTING POINT.
8 Eccarius has been appointed active secretary (in addition to Boon as HONORARY ONE), and is being paid for it.

It forces the fellows in Germany to think, for the first time since Lassalle started his agitation, something hitherto regarded as completely superfluous.
This can be seen plainly in the letter from Bonhorst.
453 In other respects, too, I find the letter not bad; despite the affectation and semi-education, it contains a certain healthy popular humour and, with the mortgage, he has hit the nail on the head.
Incidentally, the people forget that, apart from the main business with big landed property, there are also various sorts of peasant: (1) the tenant farmer to whom it is immaterial whether the land belongs to the state or to the big landowner; (2) the owner, first the big peasant, against whose reactionary existence the day-labourers and farm-hands should be incited; second the middle peasant, also reactionary and not very numerous; and third, the debt-laden small peasant, who can be got at through his mortgage.

1 November 1869 the time being, the proletariat has no interest in raising the question of small land-holding.
It is delightful that that simple soul Goegg has now been sacked by his own people for being too communist! The worthy Ladendorff is behind this.
Beust' 1 may be a communist on paper, but can easily be caught if he is told that the money was not given for that reason, but only to revolutionise Germany in general.
Now we are supposed even to keep alive the unhappy Felleisen, though all that can be said is that, the sooner it goes to the devil, the better.
You could send me some characteristic specimens of the German stuff so that I might remain a little au couranù The Prussians have once again produced a wonderful Prussian trick by destroying the Langensalza memorial in Celle.
Never has anything been more grovelling than Mr Miquel's interpellation on this point.
Roon took the opportunity to conclude that, in Prussia, an official order from above is sufficient for the military to trample on any court decision.
454 I am sorry about Serno'; he seems, for a change, to have been a decent Russian.
448 But I am still sorrier for Goegg with his opinion about Serno's classical French,d of which we have also seen samples.
It is a real stroke of luck that the Bee-Hive is now flaunting the bourgeois colours both insolently and stupidly.
I have never seen such a filthy issue as that of yesterday.
455 This cringing to Gladstone and the whole bourgeois-patronising-philanthropic tone must break the back of the sheet, and make the need felt for a real workers' paper.
It is a very good thing that, just at the moment when the workers sober up from their liberal intoxica­ tion, their only paper should become more and more bourgeois.
But Sam Morley should not be so stupid as to put such stupid chaps there, and to allow them to spread the bourgeois varnish so thickly and so obviously.
The Fenian demonstration in Londone simply proves once again the value the press attaches to public opinion.
About 100,000 assembled in the most imposing demonstration seen in London for years and, since it is in the interests of RESPECTABILITY, the entire London press, with no exception, manages to depict this as a shabby FAILURE.

457 Schweitzer — utilising Liebknecht's anxiety with regard to his democratic friendsb —is behaving as though polemics against landed property were the first word in the Lassallean creed! Quelle impudence! Incidentally, Bonhorst did him good service in an issue of the Volksstaat that I cannot find.

6 November 1869 where overrun by police as in France.
The whole alarm was produced by a HOAX.
A few agitators have had their fun in the past few weeks, circulating HANDBILLS calling on the starving workers of the East End to present themselves en masse to the Queen, and de ne pas laisser passer la reine* My family has just returned from the spectacle.
Icy coldness amongst the public.
Madame is said to have stared fuming-mad and ultra-crabby.
I shall send you, in the next few days, a volume I happened to pick up, which contains all sorts of pamphlets on Ireland.
Those by Ensor (whom I also quoted in Capital) contain many piquant points.
b Ensor was a political economist of English origin (his father still lived in England when Ensor was born), Protestant and, despite all this, one of the most resolute REPEALERS461 before 1830.
Being himself indifferent to religious things, he can defend Catholicism with wit against the Protestants.
The first pamphlet in the book is by Arthur O'Connor.
I had expected rather more of it, since this O'Connor played an important role in 1798,462 and I have found good articles by him about Castlereagh's administra­ tion in Cobbett's Political Register.
Tussy should sometime look through Cobbett, for something there about Ireland.
This week Tussy and I lost 3 days putting my workroom in order.
It had become jumbled to the frontiers of possibility.

9 November 1869 369 260 ENGELS TO MARX 33 IN LONDON Manchester, 9 November 1869 Dear Moor, That is quite a bit of impudence with the vaudeville about the Régence.
3 I would scarcely have expected the EMPIRE to put up with something like this.
But we see what can be done with pluck, though of course, our Guidos and Wilhelms b will not take this as their example.
The Réforme, just like Réveil and Rappel, is rather weak, though a certain amount of declamation can be excused at the moment.
The fellows are confused, however.
Among them, particularly Raspail.
The idea of selecting a provisional government at this very date is as good as a joke against Bonaparte, but otherwise, naturally, nonsense.
Bonaparte is supposed to be ill again; things appear to be drawing to an end for him physically, too.
Schweitzer's turnabout immediately to adopt the Basle decision on landed property and to behave as though he and Lassalle had always preached this, is extraordinarily bare-faced, 458 but very ingenious vis-à-vis the simple souls à la Wilhelm.
But what should they do when confronted by this blackguard, who has enough brains always to behave correctly as far as theory is concerned, and who knows that they are completely at a loss as soon as a theoretical point comes up.
Incidentally, I did not see the Volksstaat here.
I did not expect Monsieur Careyc to be such an amusing bit of reading.
I find his cock-and-bull stories of natural sciences read very well and provide plenty of occasions for laughter.
I would not have dared consider the man so stupid and uninformed.
For instance, he has disintegrated carbon, and it consists of carbonic acid and CINDERS! Ditto, water disintegrates into vapour.
Geology proves that plants and even ferns were in existence long before any animal! The disintegration of metals is a mere trifle for him—in voltaic batteries the tin and copper of which they consist are disintegrated! And a hundred other things.

12 November 1869 fables.
The fellow imagines that, in South Lancashire, among other places the Forest of Rossendale (a dense industrial district), the rental is so high only because the ground here is extremely productive of corn! I am making you a whole pile of marginal notes, etc.
, and as soon as I have read the rent theory I shall write my opinion of it and return the book to you.
He naturally explains the origin of rent with just such a nonsensical cut-throat theory as Ricardo, and also his idea of how it took place is as absurd as the way all economists imagine such things.
Yet this does not affect the theory of rent itself.
What Carey means by the'best landman be seen from the fact that, according to him, even today in the Northern States it is only profitable in exceptional cases to cultivate the so-called best land! Post closing.

12 November 1869 371 You are surprised by the pluck of the French,3 and speak SOMEWHAT SNEERINGLY of us upright Germans.
What risks we take you will see from the enclosed extravaganza.
In Stuttgart, in accordance with his habit, Freiligrath once again had himself photographed in several dozen poses, decked out as a statue, etc.
The most successful holy picture of this Classen-Kappelmann-hero463 is—verbotenus0—a scene in which he as a lion rides on a camel.
This is probably a back-hander for Heine's camel who defeats the lion.
c Liebknecht will be taking off next week for 3 months in prison, and has sent Borkheim a desperate plea for money.
What scares me about the French is the terrible confusion in their heads.
Ledru-Rollin's circular letter is quite that of a pretender.
464 He really appears to take au sérieux' 1 the dictatorship over France offered him by Heinzen.
On the other hand, Zukunft has been good enough to offer Mr Acollas, whom nobody in Paris knows, a post in the provisional government, because he had called the French to accept Dr J.
Jacoby's programme instead of the antiquated human and citoyen" rights of 1793.
One good turn deserves another.
I find that OLD Jacoby himself is not playing properly the role he dictated for himself.
Grasping the opportuni­ ty of the Hanoverian event, 404 should he not call on the Prussian sergeant-major-government—since Prussia is, after all, a 'military state'—also to lay aside those useless and, at the same time, expensive decorations, such as chambers, civil courts and the like? Wrapping oneself up silently in the depths of one's own moral indignation does not lure a soul from his hearth.
A while ago, the Russian gentlemen bombarded an island near Korea just for amusement, as Borkheim discovered in a Moscow newspaper/ Not a word about it in the English papers.
If things go on like this, these fine fellows will soon be in possession of Japan.
The latest MEETINGS in Ireland were very nice; the clerics were seized by their collars and removed from the speaker's stand.
Instead of the programme on Ireland,8 for which there is no proper motive, I have had (in order to adopt resolutions) the following placed on the agenda for next Tuesday.

17 November 1869 373 these constant relapses will finally lead you to the conclusion that you must commence a more rational way of life.
You poison your blood yourself by making regular digestion impossible.
And you certainly don't then produce the same quantum (and quale*) of work as you would under normal circumstances.
The idyllic drama Familienglück coram Philistaco is really enchanting.
13 One does not know what to admire more, the fadaisec of the speeches and the poets (only interrupted by the nasty-sounding nonsense of boozy Karl Beck), or the importunity of the family, which has something like this printed as 'manuscript for friends' (that is PUBLIC for non-friends).
But it is not quite clear to me how the noble Freiligrath can have printed the intrepid words of the tender-hearted Walesrode: that the poet Freiligrath has also achieved something in the way of worldly possessions (by begging 6).
I would like to have seen the faces in his family when these words were uttered.
Monsieur Ledru-Rollin is certainly reckoning on nothing other than a dictatorship.
The litde fellow Louis Blanc also re-emerged as though nothing had happened—why not the others? At a moment like this, the bourgeois press does not tell us anything about what is really happening, and even the revolutionary press does not suffice to enlighten one.
The confusion is certainly great, but it is equally certain that the crisis is not yet really close.
But a general in Paris has said: Nous avons encore un Empereur, mais l'empire n'existe plus.
d The Russians are having a rare old time of it in Asia.
They are now happily waging war with the Khan of Kashgar,e formerly subject to the Chinese, but who has now made himself indepen­ dent.
If they subdue him, they will run directly up against countries already under English dominion (Ladekh, Kashmir), about 200 miles from the English frontier.
You will have seen Vâmbéry's news (taken over by English papers from the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung 1) about the trickery in Bukhara (where, under treaty, Russian goods pay 3% customs, English 40%!), Afghanis­ tan, etc.
John Bull's stupidity is becoming ever greater, as a result of his bumptiousness.

Social-Demokrat and Volksstaat, 3.
3 COPIES for you, Moore and Schorlemmer of the Report on the Basle Congress.
I don't know if I have already sent it.
In this case, the COPIES can be given to other people.
I'll look after your commissions/ The Bee-Hive completely suppressed the report (by Eccarius) on the latest session,*1 on the pretext that it had received it too late.
The real reason was that: 1.
it did not wish to announce that the GENERAL COUNCIL would open a discussion on the Irish question at its next meeting; 2.
in the report, unfavourable references were made to it (i.
e.
, to Mr Potter), about the LAND AND LABOUR LEAGUE.
4''1 The fact is that Mr Potter failed glaringly as a candidate for the COMMITTEE of the LEAGUE.
Last Tuesdaye I opened the discussion on point 1 : the attitude of the British Ministry to the IRISH AMNESTY QUESTION .
I spoke for ABOUT an hour and a quarter, MUCH CHEERED,468 and then proposed the following resolutions ON point No.
1 : * Resolved, that in his reply to the Irish demands for the release of the imprisoned Irish patriots—a reply contained in his letter to Mr O'Shea etc.
etc.
— Mr Gladstone deliberately insults the Irish Nation; that he clogs political amnesty with conditions alike degrading to the victims of misgovernment and the people they belong to; that having, in the teeth of his responsible position, publicly and enthusiastically cheered on the American slaveholders' Rebel­ lion,469 he now steps in to preach to the Irish people the doctrine of passive obedience; a See this volume, p.

18 November 1869 that his whole proceedings with reference to the Irish Amnesty question are the true and genuine offspring of that 'policy of conquest', by the fiery denunciation of which Mr Gladstone ousted his Tory rivals from office; that the General Council of the 'International Working Men's Association' express their admiration of the spirited, firm and highsouled manner in which the Irish people carry on their Amnesty movement; that these resolutions be communicated to all branches of, and working men's bodies connected with, the 'International Working Men's Association' in Europe and America.
*3 Harris (an O'Brien-MAN) declared TO SECOND.
But the President (Lucraft) pointed to the clock (we may only stay until 11); HENCE, adjourned until next Tuesday.
However, Lucraft, Weston, Hales etc.
, IN FACT the whole COUNCIL, tentatively declared their agreement IN INFORMAL WAY.
Milner, another O'Brienite, declared that the language of the RESOLUTIONS was too weak (i.
e.
, not declamatory enough); further­ more he demands that everything I said in support of the case should be included in the RESOLUTIONS.
(A fine kettle of fish!) Since the debate will continue on Tuesday, NOW THE TIME FOR YOU to tell, rather to write, me anything you might wish to amend or add to the RESOLUTIONS.
In the latter case, if you, for example, wish to add a paragraph about the amnesties all over Europe, ITALY for example, write it at once in resolution form.

Tentatively declared that he should first take out a card as a member of the INTERNATIONAL WORKING MENS ASSOCIATION, otherwise he cannot even be proposed.
His aim is SIMPLY to make himself important—and to figure as a DELEGATE at the next GENERAL CONGRESS.
The debate on his ADMISSION will be stormy, since he has many friends among us and, as an offended intriguant, could play some nasty tricks on us.
What are your ideas about the tactics to be followed? Enclosed—screed from Liebknecht, 470 who has also complained bitterly in his letter to Borkheim that we do not support him, either morally or materially.

19 November 1869 Lizzie immediately passed a VOTE OF THANKS to you for the resolution, and is vexed that she will not be able to be there on Tuesday.
The business with Holyoake is vexatious.
3 The fellow is simply a GO-BETWEEN for the radical bourgeoisie with the workers.
The question is this: is the composition of the GENERAL COUNCIL such that a SWAMPING by such rabble is to be feared or not? If you accept Holyoake, then others might follow, and they will do so as soon as the affair becomes more important.
Moreover, if the times become more tempestuous, these gentlemen will certainly also visit the sessions, and try to grasp the leadership.
And as far as I know, Mr Holyoake has never done the slightest thing for the working class as such.
A priori, everything against his acceptance, but if his rejection would lead to splits in the COUNCIL, while his acceptance would, in practice, make little difference to the constitution of the GENERAL COUNCIL, eh bienh! Despite this I cannot well envisage a workers' COUNCIL with this fellow on it.
Before the receipt of yours of yesterday, I had sent Wilhelm 0 £5 with a few frosty lines.
The fellow really is too brazen-faced.
First he insults me in every way, then I should give moral and material support, and send him articles for his sheet/ which he has ceased sending me without saying a word.
If you should write to him, you would be doing me a favour if you let him understand that, if he wants articles from me, he should pray write directly to me.
To act as bootblack to Mr Wilhelm —that crowns it all! Enclosed, the letter returned.
Best thanks for the Irish PAMPHLETS and REPORTS/ I shall deliver the two for Moore and Schorlemmer.
When was Reclus in London 471? And how is the French translation of your book going441? Since I have been back here I haven't heard a word about it.
And now for Carey.
1 The entire point at issue does not seem to me to be directly connected with political economy as such.
Ricardo says that rent is the surplus yield of the more productive plots of land over that of the least productive.
Carey says exactly the same.

19 November 1869 379 rent materialises, is a matter of dispute.
Now, Ricardo's description of the process by which RENT originates (Carey, p.
104), is just as unhistorical as all such historical travesties by the economists, and Carey's own great Robinson-Crusoe-story about Adam and Eve (p.
96 et seq.
).
With regard to the older economists, including Ricardo, this is still excusable to some extent; they do not wish for historical knowledge; they are just as unhistorical in their whole conception as the other apostles of the 18th-century Enlightenment, for whom such alleged historical digressions are always only a façon de parler*, enabling them to represent the origin of this or that in a rational manner, and in which primitive men always think and behave as if they were 18th-century French philosophers.
But when Carey, who wants to propound an historical theory of his own, proceeds to present Adam and Eve to us as Yankee backwoodsmen, then he cannot demand that we believe him, for he lacks the same excuse.
The entire point at issue would be nil, had not Ricardo, in his naivety, simply called the more productive land 'FERTILE'.
According to Ricardo, THE MOST FERTILE AND MOST FAVOURABLY SITUATED LAND is cultivated first.
Just the way a thoughtful bourgeois, on land cultivated for centuries, must picture things.
Now Carey clings to the 'FERTILE' and foists upon Ricardo the assertion that the lands that are in themselves the most productive are those first cultivated, and states: No, on the contrary, the lands in themselves the most capable of production (the Amazon valley, the Ganges delta, tropical Africa, Borneo and New Guinea, etc.
) are not cultivated even today; the first settlers, because they cannot do otherwise, always commence cultivation on self-draining land, that is to say, strips situated on hills and slopes, and these are by nature poorer.
And when Ricardo says: FERTILE AND THE MOST FAVOURABLY SITUATED, he is saying the same thing, without noticing that he is expressing himself LOOSELY and that a contradiction can be seen between these two qualifications connected by AND.
But when Carey gives a sketch on p.
138 and claims that Ricardo places his first settlers in the valley, while Carey puts them on the heights (in the sketch on bare crags and impracticable slopes of 45 degrees) he is simply falsely imputing this to Ricardo.
b Carey's historical examples, as far as they apply to America, are the only useful things in the book.

Engels to Marx.
19 November 1869 beginning, and is well posted about it.
Nevertheless, there is undoubtedly a lot of uncritical stuff mixed up in it, which would have to be sifted.
When he speaks of Europe, however, the structures and the untenableness get under way.
And that Carey is not unprejudiced with regard to America is shown by the eagerness with which he attempts to prove the worthlessness, indeed the NEGATIVE value-quality of the uncultivated land (that the land is, so to speak, worth minus 10 dollars an ACRE) and praises the self-sacrifice of societies that, to their own certain ruin, make waste land serviceable for mankind.
Related in the country of colossal land jobbery, this becomes ludicrous.
Incidentally, he never mentions prairie land here, and elsewhere it is touched upon very lightly.
The whole story of the negative value-quality of the waste land, and all his calculated proofs are best contradicted by America itself.
If the story were true, America would not only be the poorest of countries, but would become relatively poorer every year, because more and more labour would be thrown away on this worthless land.
Now, as for his definition of RENT: THE AMOUNT RECEIVED AS RENT IS INTEREST UPON THE VALUE OF LABOUR EXPENDED, MINUS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRODUCTIVE POWER (THE RENT-PAYING LAND) AND THAT OF THE NEWER SOILS WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT INTO ACTIVITY BY THE APPLICATION OF THE SAME LABOUR THAT HAS BEEN THERE GIVEN TO THE WORK (pp.
165, 166), this may have a certain amount of validity here and there, within certain limits, especially in America.
But RENT is, in any case, such a complicated thing, to which so many other circumstances contribute, that even in these cases it can apply only ceteris paribus," only when 2 pieces of land lie side by side.
Ricardo knew as well as he that INTEREST FOR THE VALUE OF LABOUR EXPENDED is also included in RENT.
If Carey declares land as such worse than worthless, then RENT must naturally be INTEREST UPON THE VALUE OF LABOUR EXPENDED or theft, as it is called on p.
139.
Carey still owes us an explanation of the transition from theft to interest.
It seems to me that the origin of rent in different countries, and even in one and the same country, is by no means such a simple process as both Ricardo and Carey imagine.
In Ricardo, as I said, this is excusable; it is the history of the fishers and hunters in the sphere of agriculture.
It is not, in fact, an economic dogma, but Carey wants, furthermore, to make a dogma out of his theory and prove it to the world as such, for which, indeed, historical studies of a very different sort from Mr Carey's are necessary.
a other things being equal 265.
Engels to Marx.
19 November 1869 381 There may even have been localities where RENT originated as Ricardo suggests, and others where it originated in Carey's way, and yet others where it had quite different origins.
To Carey one may also remark that, where fever has to be reckoned with, in particular tropical fever, economics more or less come to an end.
Unless his theory of population can be thus interpreted: with the increase in population, the surplus people are forced to cultivate the most fertile, i.
e.
, the most unhealthy stretches of land, in which they either succeed or perish; in this way he would successfully establish harmony between himself and Malthus.
In northern Europe, RENT originated neither in Ricardo's nor in Carey's way, but simply from the feudal burdens, later brought by free competition to their correct economic level.
In Italy it was different again, vide" Rome.
To calculate what part of the RENT in the long civilised countries is really original RENT and what part is interest on labour invested is impossible, since it differs in each case.
Moreover, it is of no importance, once it has been shown that RENT can also increase without labour being put into land.
The grandfather of Sir Humphrey de Trafford at Old Trafford near Manchester had such a load of debts on his back that he had no idea what to do.
His grandson, after paying off all the debts, has an income of £40,000 a year.
If we subtract about £10,000, which comes from building sites, £30,000 remains as the yearly value of the agricultural ESTATE, which 80 years ago brought in perhaps £2,000.
Further, if £3,000 be taken as the interest on invested labour and capital, and that's a lot, there remains an increase of £25,000, which is five times the former value, including IMPROVE­ MENTS.
And all this, not because labour is contained in it, but because labour was put into something else nearby, since the ESTATE lies close to a city like Manchester, where good prices are paid for milk, butter and garden produce.
The same happens on a big scale.
From the moment when England became a corn-and cattle-importing country, and even before then, population density became a factor determining or increasing RENT, quite indepen­ dently of the labour invested generally in the land of England.
Ricardo, with his MOST FAVOURABLY SITUATED LANDS, also considers the relation to the market, but Carey ignores this.
And if he were then to say: the land itself has only a negative value, but the location has a positive value, he would thereby admit what he denies—that land, just because it can be monopolised, has, or can have, a value independent of the labour invested.
But on this point Carey is as quiet as a mouse.
11 see It is equally a matter of indifference whether the labour invested in land in civilised countries pays regularly or not.
I asserted more than 20 years ago that in today's society no instrument of production exists that could last 60-100 years—no factory, no building, etc.
—that, by the end of its existence, has covered the cost of its production.
All in all, I still believe this is perfectly true.
And if Carey and I are both right, this proves nothing either about the rate of profit or the origin of rent, but simply that bourgeois production, even measured by its own standards, is rotten.
These random comments on Carey will no doubt be enough for you.
They are very mixed, because I made no excerpts.
As for the historic-materialist-scientific trimmings, their entire value=those two trees, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge, which he has planted in his paradisiacal work, not indeed for his Adam and Eve who have to drudge in the backwoods, but for their descendants.
His ignorance and slovenliness are only equalled by the impu­ dence that allows him to present such nonsense publicly.
You will not expect me to read the other chapters.
It is pure blather, and the grammatical errors are no longer strewn so closely.
I'll send you the book as soon as I go up to town; out here no pillar-box is large enough to take it.

26 November 1869 383 266 MARX TO ENGELS 477 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 26 November 1869 DEAR FRED, This week I have not been really on my feet, and the business under my arm is still a bother.
That's why I didn't thank you earlier for the notes on Carey, whose VOLUME I also received yesterday.
3 In my book against Proudhon, in which I still fully accepted Ricardo's theory of RENT, I already explained the fallacies, even from his (Ricardo's) own point of view.
b 'Ricardo, after postulating bourgeois production as necessary for determining rent, applies the conception of rent, nevertheless, to the landed property of all ages and all countries.
This is an error common to all the economists, who represent the bourgeois relations of production as eternal categories.
' Mr Proudhon naturally converts Ricardo's theory into an expression of egalitarian morals at once, and thus discovers in the rent determined by Ricardo: 'an immense land valuation which is carried out contradictorily by the proprietors and the farmers .
.
.
in a higher interest, and whose ultimate result must be to equalise the possession of the land, etc' To this I remarked, inter alia: 'For any land valuation based upon rent to be of practical value, the conditions of present society must not be departed from.
Now we have shown that the rentc paid by the farmer to the landowner expresses the rentA with any exactitude only in the countries most advanced in industry and commerce.
Moreover, this rent often includes interest paid to the landowner on capital incorporated in land.
The location of the land, the nearness of towns, and many other circumstances influence the farm rent and modify the land rent.
.
.
On the other hand, rent could not be the invariable index of the degree of fertility of the land, since every moment the modern application of chemistry is changing the nature of the soil, and geological knowledge is just now, in a See this volume, pp.

26 November 1869 our days, beginning to revolutionise all the old estimates of relative fertility .
.
.
fertility is not so natural a quality as might be thought; it is closely bound up with the social relations of the time.
' As far as the development of cultivation in the UNITED STATES is concerned, Mr Carey ignores even the most familiar facts.
For instance, Johnston, the English agricultural chemist, shows in his Notes on the UNITED STATES3: the agricultural migrants from New England to New York State left worse for better land (better not in Carey's sense of land, which still had to be made first, but in the chemical and also economic sense); the agricultural migrants from New York State who first settled beyond the Great Lakes, SAY IN MICHIGAN FOR INSTANCE, left better for worse land, etc.
The settlers in Virginia exploited so abominably the land so suitable both in location and fertility for tobacco, their main product, that they had to move on to Ohio, where the land was worse for this product (if not also for wheat, etc.
).
The nationality of the immigrants also made itself felt in their settlements.
The people from Norway and from our timber forests selected the rugged northern forest land of Wisconsin; the Yankees in the same territory kept to the prairies, etc.
Prairies, both in the UNITED STATES and Australia, are, IN FACT, a thorn in Carey's flesh.
According to him, land not absolutely overgrown with forest is infertile by nature, that is all natural grasslands.
The joke of it is that Carey's two great final conclusions (with regard to the UNITED STATES) directly contradict to his dogma.
First, as a result of England's diabolical influence, the inhabitants, instead of socially cultivating the good model lands of New England DISSEMINATED to the poorer (!) lands of the West.
Thus, a move from better land to worse.
(Besides, BY THE BY, Carey's DISSEMINATION, in opposition to association, is all copied from Wakefield.
b ) Second, in the south of the UNITED STATES we have the misfortune that the slave-owners (whom Mr Carey, as a harmon­ iser, defended in all his previous works) take the better land under cultivation too soon and skip the worse.
Thus, just what should not happen: starting with the better land! If, with this example, Carey convinces himself that the real cultivators—in this case the slaves—are induced neither by economic reasons, or other reasons OK THEIR OWN, but by external constraint, he should have been able to a J.

26 November 1869 385 count on his own 5 fingers that this occurs in other countries too.
According to his theory, cultiv&tion in Europe should have originated in the mountains of Norway and proceeded from there to the Mediterranean countries, instead of marching in the other direction.
Carey tries, by means of an extremely absurd and fantastic theory of money, to conjure up anyway the very disgusting economic fact that, in contrast to all other improved machinery, the always better earth-machine, increases the cost of its product— at least for a period—instead of cheapening it.
(This was one of the circumstances that struck Ricardo; but he poked his nose no further than the history of corn prices in England from ABOUT 1780 to 1815.
) As a harmoniser, Carey first proved there was no ANTAGONISM between capitalist and wage labourer.
The second step was to show the harmony between landowner and capitalist, and this is done by showing land-ownership as being normal where it has not yet developed.
The fact that may, under no circumstances, be mentioned is the great and decisive difference between a colony and an old civilised country: that, in the latter, the mass of the population is excluded by landed property from the soil, whether it be fertile or infertile, cultivated or uncultivated; while in the colonies, the land can, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, still be appropriated by the cultivator himself.
This may play absolutely no part in the rapid development of the colonies.
The disgusting 'property question', and that in its most disgusting form, would of course put a spoke in the wheel of harmony.
As regards the deliberate distortion that, because in a country with developed production the natural fertility of the soil is an important factor in the production of surplus value (or, as Ricardo says, affects the rate of profit), it follows conversely that the richest and most developed production will be found in those areas most fertile by nature, so it should be higher in Mexico, for example, than New England; I have already answered this in Capital, p.
502 et seq.
a Carey's only merit is that he asserts, just as one-sidedly, the movement from worse to better land as Ricardo asserts the opposite.
In fact, however, soil-types of differing grades of fertility are always cultivated simultaneously, and for this reason the Germans, the Slavs and the Celts very carefully distributed scraps a Marx refers to the first German edition of Capital, Vol.
I (see present edition, Vol.
35).
386 266.
Marx to Engels.
26 November 1869 of land of different types amongst the members of the communi­ ty; it was this that later made division of the community lands so difficult.
As for the development of cultivation in the course of history, this—depending on the circumstances—takes place in both directions simultaneously, and one direction or the other dominates according to the epoch.
The factor that makes the interest on the capital invested in the land a component part of differential rent is precisely the fact that the landowner receives this interest from capital which not he, but the tenant-farmer has invested in the land.
This FACT, known throughout Europe, is claimed to have no economic existence, because the tenant-farmer system has not yet developed in the UNITED STATES.
But this fact presents itself in another form there.
The LAND JOBBER and not the tenant-farmer is ultimately paid in the price he gets for the land, for the capital expended by the tenant-farmer.
Indeed, the history of the PIONEERS and the LAND JOBBERS in the UNITED STATES is reminiscent of the worst horrors taking place, for instance, in Ireland.
BUT NOW DAMN CAREY! VIVAT FOR O'DONOVAN ROSSA! Last Tuesday's meeting was very fiery, lively, vehement.
478 Mr MUDDLEHEAD,3 or the devil knows what he's called—a Chartist, an old friend of Harney's—had foresightedly brought Odger and Applegarth along.
On the other hand, Weston and Lucraft were absent, attending an Irish ball.
Reynolds's had published my RESOLUTIONS'3 in its Saturday issue, together with an ABSTRACT of my SPEECH0 (as well as Eccarius could do it; he's no stenographer) and Reynolds's printed it right on the front page of the paper following opening editorial.

Also, various things by old Petty.
Last week I ploughed through the TRACTS of old Sir John Davies (ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR IRELAND under James)482; I don't know whether you've read them, they are the main source, but you've certainly found them quoted 100 times.
It's downright shame that the original sources are not everywhere available; one gets infinitely more out of them than from the compilers, who make everything that is clear and simple confused and intricate.
The tracts show clearly that, in Anno 1600, common ownership of land still existed IN FULL FORCE and was cited by Mr Davies in his pleas on the forfeited land in Ulster as evidence that the land did not belong to the individual owners (peasants), and thus [belonged] either to the LORD, who had forfeited it or, from the outset, to the Crown.
I've never read anything finer than this plea.
Re-allotments were made every two or three years.
In another PAMPHLET he describes the income of the chief of the clan in exact detail.
I've never seen these things quoted, and if you can use them, I'll send you them in detail.
At the same time, I've caught out Monsieur Goldwin Smith beautifully/ The fellow never read Davies, so makes the most ridiculous assertions to exonerate the English.

29 November 1869 St Petersburg on the situation of the working classes (OF COURSE, PEASANTS INCLUDED) in Russia, 2 and, finally, my state of health is by no means satisfactory.
You will probably have seen in the Volksstaat the resolutions I proposed regarding Gladstone on the Irish amnesty question.
11 I have now attacked Gladstone—and this has attracted attention here—just as I attacked Palmerstonc earlier.
The demagogic REFUGEES here love to attack the continental despots from a safe distance.
I find this only attractive if it is done vultu instantis tyranni.
d Yet both my appearance on this Irish amnesty issue and, further, my proposal to the GENERAL COUNCIL that it should discuss the attitude of the English working class to Ireland and adopt a resolution on the subject,5 naturally had other grounds than simply to speak out loudly and decidedly for the OPPRESSED IRISH against their OPPRESSORS.
I have become more and more convinced—and the thing now is to drum this conviction into the English working class—that they will never be able to do anything decisive here in England before they separate their attitude towards Ireland quite definitely from that of the ruling classes, and not only make common cause with the Irish, but even take the initiative in dissolving the UNION461 established in 1801, and substituting a free federal relationship for it.
And this must be done not out of sympathy for Ireland, but as a demand based on the interests of the English proletariat.
If not, the English people will remain bound to the leading-strings of the ruling classes, because they will be forced to make a common front with them against Ireland.
Every movement of the working class in England itself is crippled by the dissension with the Irish, who form a very important section of the working class in England itself.
The primary condition for emancipation here—the over­ throw of the English landed oligarchy—remains unattainable, since its positions cannot be stormed here as long as it holds its strongly-entrenched outposts in Ireland.
But over there, once affairs have been laid in the hands of the Irish people themselves, as soon as they have made themselves their own legislators and rulers, as soon as they have become autonomous, it will be infinitely easier there than here to abolish the landed aristocracy (to a large extent the same persons as the English LANDLORDS) since in a H.

29 November 1869 391 Ireland it is not just merely an economic question, but also a national one, as the LANDLORDS there are not, as they are in England, traditional dignitaries and representatives, but the mortally-hated oppressors of the nationality.
And not only does England's internal social development remain crippled by the present relationship to Ireland, but also her foreign policy, in particular her policy with regard to Russia and the United States of America.
Since, however, the English working class undoubtedly throws the greatest weight on the scales of social emancipation generally, this is the point where the lever must be applied.
It is a fact that the English Republic under Cromwell met shipwreck in— Ireland.
85 Non bis in idem*! The Irish have played a capital joke on the English government by electing the CONVICT FELON O'Donovan Rossa as member of Parliament.
b Government newspapers are already threatening a renewed suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act,486 a renewed system of terror! In fact, England never has and never can rule Ireland any other way, as long as the present relationship continues—only with the most abominable reign of terror and the most reprehensible corruption.
In France things are going well so far.
On the one hand, the outmoded demagogic and democratic bawlers of all shades are compromising themselves.
On the other, Bonaparte has been driven along a path of concession on which he is bound to break his neck.
Yesterday's Observer (this weekly belongs to the Ministry), referring to the Eulenburg scandal 487 in the Prussian Chamber, remarks: 'Napoleon said: "Grattez le Rvsse, et vous trouverez le Tartare'".

4 December 1869 269 MARX TO ENGELS 489 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 4 December 1869 DEAR FRED, The RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY CARRIED 3 despite Odger's incessant VERBAL AMENDMENTS.
I gave in to him on only one point, to omit the word 'DELIBERATE' before 'INSULTS' in para.
l.
b I did this ON PRETENCE,THAT EVERYTHING A PRIME MINISTER PUBLICLY DID, MUST BE PRESUMED eo ipso TO BE DELIBERATE.
The real reason was that I knew, as soon as the first para, was accepted in substance^ all further opposition would be in vain.
I'm sending you 2 National Reformers containing reports on the 2 first sessions, not yet on the latest.
This report, too, is poor, and much is quite wrong (due to misunderstanding), but better than Eccarius' reports in Reynolds's.
They are by Harris, whose currence panacea you will also find in the latest number of the National Reformer.
490 With the exception of Mottershead, who appeared as John Bull, and Odger, who as always acted the diplomat, the English delegates have behaved excellently.
The general debate on the attitude of the ENGLISH WORKING CLASS to the IRISH QUESTION begins on Tuesday.
491 One has to struggle here not only against prejudices, but also against the stupidity and wretchedness of the Irish spokesmen in Dublin.
The Irishman (Pigott) cannot know of the proceedings and RESOLUTIONS solely from Reynolds's, to which he subscribes and from which he often quotes.
They (the RESOLUTIONS) had already been sent him directly by an Irishman on 17 November/ Till today, deliberately not a word.
The jackass behaved in a similar way during our debate and petition for 3 MANCHESTER MEN.
492 The 'IRISH' QUESTION must be treated as something quite distinct, excluding the outside world, and it must be concealed that English workers sympathise with the Irish! What a dumb ox! And this with regard to the International, which has press organs all over Europe and the UNITED STATES! This week he has received the RESOLUTIONS officially, signed by the FOREIGN SECRETARIES.
The material has also been sent to the 'People'.

But I'll play a trick on Pigott.
I'm writing to Eccarius today, asking him to send the RESOLUTIONS with the signatures, etc.
, to Isaac Butt, the President of the IRISH WORKING MEN'S ASSOCIATION.
Butt is not Pigott.
The following explains to you the enclosed letter from Applegarth: After the end of the last session, in which he behaved very well, he took me aside and told me the following: AN EMINENT MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS3 had written to him that he had been commissioned BY AN EMINENT MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS (LORD Leach-field!) to ask him whether he had voted for the abolition OF ALL PRIVATE PROPERTY at Basle.
379 His answer was decisive for the attitude towards him of Applegarth's parliamentary patrons.
He (Ap­ plegarth) wanted to give the fellows a decisive answer, I should write down briefly the 'reasons', and this the following day.
I was very busy, as well as still SUFFERING under the arm; cold made worse by the frightful FOG after the session on Tuesday evening.
Thus, wrote to Applegarth on Wednesdayb that I had been prevented, but READY TO SUPPORT HIM when he received a reply.
493 With English obstinacy he did not accept; wrote enclosed letter.
494 So I was WILLY-NILLY forced to write him 8 closely-written pages, which will give him a lot to pore over about LANDED PROPERTY and the NECESSITY OF ITS ABOLITION.
495 The fellow is very important since, ON THE PART OF BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT he is the officially recognised representa­ tive of the English TRADES UNIONS.
Enclosed, also, a letter from Bracke.
496 I have nothing against Bonhorst; I had only told Kugelmann that I regarded him as a rather revolutionary character.
Kugelmann, with his usual tact, informed Bracke of this in amplified form.
Tussy thanks Didoc very much for his letter, and sends greetings to all.

270 ENGELS TO MARX 489 IN LONDON Manchester, 9 December 1869 Dear Moor, In the reports in the National Reformer 490 a certain amount of nonsense is, however, attributed to you.
They can't get along without something like that.
I see, the Bee-Hive is ignoring the whole debate.
This is called publicity, just like the dear old Didaskalia für Geist, Gemüt und Publizität I half expected what happened with The Irishman.
Ireland still remains the sacra insula, 1" whose aspirations may not be lumped together with the profane class struggle of the rest of the sinful world.
Partly, this is certainly an honest madness of these people, but equally certainly it is partly a calculated policy on the part of the spokesmen in order to maintain their domination over the peasants.
In addition, a nation of peasants is always forced to take its literary representatives from among the bourgeoisie of the towns and its ideologists, and here Dublin (I mean Catholic Dublin) is approximately to Ireland what Copenhagen is to Denmark.
For these gentry, however, the whole labour movement is pure heresy, and the Irish peasant must not be allowed to find out that the socialist workers are his sole allies in Europe.
In other respects, too, the Irishman is very scurvy this week.
If it was ready to retreat in this way at the first threat of SUSPENSION of the Habeas Corpus Act,486 then the sabre-rattling was absolutely misplaced from the start.
And now even the fear that still more political prisoners might be elected! On the one hand, the Irish are warned, quite rightly, not to let themselves be inveigled into any illegalities; on the other, they should be held back from doing the only lawful thing that is opportune and revolutionary in character, the only thing that might successfully break with the established practice of electing place-hunting lawyers and might impress the English liberals.
Pigott is obviously afraid that others could outstrip him here.
Of course you will remember how O'Connell, also, always incited the Irish against the Chartists, although—or just because— they had inscribed REPEAL497 on their banner.
a sacred isle 270.
Engels to Marx.
9 December 1869 395 The question put to Applegarth is delicious.
One sees how these trumpery lords and M.
P.
s imagine that the whole labour movement is already in their pockets because Odger and Potter flirt with them and the Bee-Hive has been sold.
The gentlemen are in for a surprise.
In the meantime, it's a good thing that a new election is not, apparently, in the immediate offing; the gentlemen have to make fools of themselves first.
Applegarth and Bracke 496 returned enclosed.
From the enclosed query from Solingen you will see all the things I'm supposed to afford.
498 What should be done in this case? If I send the people 50-100 thaler it will not help them, and I can't risk more for them since, in the long run, it will certainly be throwing money away.
What is your opinion? The worthy gentlemen from tiers parti3 believe they already occupy the ministerial chairs, and have already made wonderful fools of themselves.
They vote gaily for the vindication of the prefects of Monsieur de Forcade Laroquette.
499 In this way I cannot see why any sort of ministerial change is necessary, if everything the present ministers have done is ALL RIGHT.
On the other hand, Louisb certainly believes that he has now once again so frightened the bourgeois with the red spectre that he can get away with phrases.
The business is entangling itself quite nicely.
What scurvy knaves the Prussians are.
Scarcely has an apparent­ ly constitutional wind begun to blow from Paris, when they immediately start making small concessions.
Eulenberg takes over, in the state budget, the proxy costs of the deputies who are state officials, etc.
And for this Camphausen diddles the Chamber out of 8 2/3 million annually, which previously, by law, had to be devoted to eliminating debts, and on the other hand he now abolishes the amortissement, except where the Government and the Chamber decree that there should be redemption.
The stupid Liberals themselves demanded this earlier and must now vote for it.
China, with the steady expansion of her market, appears to wish to save the COTTON TRADE once again, at least for a while.
The reports from there are considerably better, though much has been consigned there, and since then there has again been a veering-round here, and once again work is going swingingly.
This will naturally drive up the cotton price again, and the whole profit will go into the pockets of the importer.
But at least they are working here without losses.
With Gottfried0 I am now completely in the clear.
Yesterday he a the third party -b Napoleon III -c Gottfried Ermen paid me the last remainder of my money,3 and we shall now probably more or less show each other our backsides.

They themselves admit that their productive cooperative is only of local interest.
How can they expect foreign countries to contribute a SINGLE FARTHING to them, in view of the international sacrifices that the STRIKES, etc.

118 Under Lassalle's lordly sway, when Marquis Izzya was in Cologne, the same Karl Klein announced a TOAST for us, 500 the editors of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, and Izzy was forced de faire bonne mine à mauvais jeu .
b Further, their cooperative was solid and maintained itself for years.
The stupidity of the Prussian legislation forced them to fix their capital and thus reduce their working capital.
Then the Rhenish bourgeois became irritable and decided to break them up, partly by selling their OBLIGATIONS, and partly by withdrawing all COMMERCIAL ADVANCES (not based on OBLIGATIONS).
Thus, the business is of general importance and, for us, personal importance.
What I suggest is this: You send the fellows 50 thaler for OBLIGATIONS, and tell them, at the same time, that they must themselves see you can do nothing for them among the English bourgeois in Manchester.
Tell them as well — and this is a FACT—that / in London have made all possible efforts on their behalf, but in vain.
Finally, tell them—and I shall try this immediately—that I shall try to raise money for them among the German bourgeois.
I shall—naturally you will not tell them this—write immediately to Menke in Hamburg to this end.
It is possible that Menke (who is a millionaire, and has read Capital" from beginning to end, and furnished it with 'correcting notes', which he himself showed me) will do something.
2,000 thaler are nothing to such people.
They would naturally, d'abord, SEND SOMEBODY TO Solingen to look at how the thing works.
If the business is not capable of surviving, it should not and may not receive support.
If the contrary, then I am certain that these people (Menke et Co.
) will provide the money.

I did not attend the CENTRAL COUNCIL last Tuesday/ My 'FAMILY' did not allow me to go in this FOG and in my PRESENT STATE OF HEALTH, although I had undertaken TO OPEN THE DEBATES.
With regard to the report in the National Reformer,1 not only has nonsense been attributed to me, but even what is rightly reported is incorrectly reported.
But I didn't want to complain.
D'abord, I would, thereby, offend the REPORTER (Harris).
Second, as long as I don't interfere, all these reports are in no way official.

398 way it is reproduced.
BESIDES, / have reasons not to convert these reports into legal EVIDENCE against me, which happens the moment I correct details The way I shall express the matter next Tuesday is: that, quite apart from all 'international' and 'humane' phrases about JUSTICE FOR IRELAND—which are taken for granted on the INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL—it is in the direct and absolute interests of the ENGLISH WORKING CLASS TO GET WD OF THEIR PRESENT CONNEXION WITH IRELAND.
I am fully convinced of this, for reasons that, in part, I cannot tell the English workers themselves.
For a long time I believed it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by ENGLISH WORKING CLASS ASCENDANCY.
I always took this viewpoint in the New-York Tribune.
501 Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite.
The English WORKING CLASS will never accomplish anything BEFORE IT HAS GOT RID OF IRELAND.
The lever must be applied in Ireland.
This is why the Irish QUESTION is so important for the social movement in general.
I have read a lot of Davies3 in extracts.
The book itself I have only glanced through superficially in the Museum,b so you would oblige me if you would copy out for me the passages relating to COMMON PROPERTY.
You must get hold of Curran's 'Speeches' edited by Davies (London: James Duffy, 22 Paternoster Row).
I meant to give it to you when you were in London.
It is now circulating among the English MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COUNCIL, and God knows when I shall see it again.
For the period 1779-1800 (Union461) it is of decisive importance, not only because of Curran's 'Speeches' (namely in court; I regard Curran as the sole great lawyer (people's advocate) of the 18th century, and the noblest personality, while Grattan was a parliamentary rogue), but because you find all the sources about the UNITED IRISHMEN* 62 This period is of the greatest interest, SCIENTIFI­ CALLY AND DRAMATICALLY.
First, the dirty infamies of the English in 1588-89 repeated (perhaps even intensified) in 1788-89.
Second, class movement is easily shown in the Irish movement itself.
Third, the infamous policy of Pitt.
Fourth, which very much irks Messrs the English, the proof that Ireland came to grief because IN FACT, FROM A REVOLUTIONARY STANDPOINT, the Irish were too far advanced for the-ENGLISH KING AND CHURCH MOB, while, on the other hand, English reaction in England (as in Cromwell's time) had its roots in the subjugation of Ireland.

The translation of Capital GOES ON.
441 Keller has now interrupted it, however.
He wants to publish 18th Brumaire 1' first, believing this possible under the present circumstances and important for France.
As for the current Irish movement, 3 important factors: 1.
opposition to lawyers and TRADING POLITICIANS and BLARNEY; 2.
opposition to the dictates of the priests who (the higher ones) are TRAITORS, as in O'Connell's time, just as in 1798-1800; 3.
the emergence of the AGRICULTURAL LABOURING CLASS against the FARMING CLASS ON THE LAST MEETiNcs.

For a long time it stood IN OPPOSITION TO Fenianism.

16 December 1869 401 About the Solingen people—ALL RIGHT.
From the start it was my opinion that both of us had a special interest in the people.
3 I shall probably go to Barmen next week, as my mother simply insists I spend a Christmas at home again, and this time it is very possible that I shall travel to Solingen and see the people myself.
Correction of incorrect reports would naturally be of no help.
b It would have to be done every week.
I have the Curranc here, in an edition that is probably much more complete, but I suppose I shall be glad also to acquire the new edition.
For the time being I have enough to do with the early history up to 1660, and as soon as I'm finished with that, the period 1782-1800 will naturally be my main interest.
First of all, however, I want to finish off the old stuff, particularly since I have found that the original positions between 1172-1600 are everywhere represented completely falsely, and I am only slowly discovering the original sources.

That damned Giraldus Cambrensis dances before me like a will-o'-the-wisp.
I must get the fellow, since he is the first foreign, that is to say first authentic, source on the state of Ireland on the arrival of the English, and the quotations I have seen lead me to believe that I shall find something more.
The book, called Hibernia expugnata,b is nowhere to be found, but the first part, which interests me, is in the Frankfurt (!) edition of Camden's Britannia? I don't know whether in another edition.
This edition is naturally not here; an English edition in the FREE LIBRARY does not contain Giraldus505; the third volume of another edition in the lending library which might contain it is lost, and thus my only hope is the Chetham LIBRARY,480 to which I shall go tomorrow.
Incidentally, this hunt for sources is quite a different sort of pleasure than it was to hunt for customers on the blasted stock exchange.
Are Petty's Political Anatomy of Ireland and Political Survey of Ireland two different works, or only different editions? For the latter is here.
I have here a later edition of Kane's book; the one from you is unfortunately of little use because of its age (1846).
506 I am making a written record of each period as soon as I have fairly finished my studies.
Then you have the interrelations more clearly in your head and, altogether, a more vivid idea of the business, and can still make corrections.
That is why, on the whole, I am keeping so strictly to the historic periods in arranging the order in which I plough through sources.
I am nearly finished up to 1600.
On the side, I am reading Grant's CAMPAIGN AGAINST Richmond by Cannon.
d Grant is a self-willed jackass who had so little confidence in himself and his army that he never dared undertake the simplest flanking manoeuvre against Lee, who was weaker by half, before he had weakened him by several days of frontal attack and had nailed him down in his original position.
He relied upon the simple calculation that if he lost three men for every one of Lee's, then Lee would run out of people before he did.
Nowhere else have there been such brutal butcheries as on that occasion.

Because of his health, he has had to hang around since then in Switzerland, etc.

Strohn will be returning from here to Bradford, and desires you to return him the Urnings or whatever the paederast's book is called.

I remember vaguely that, in his introduction, Prendergast depicts the Anglo-Norman period, it seems to me, in fantastic-uncritical-optimistic radiant colours.

Mr Odger has now noticed how useful it was for him to vote for the RESOLUTIONS despite all sorts of diplomatic objections.
As a result, the 3-4,000 Irish electors in Southwark have promised him their votes.
From the enclosed Egalité, which I must have back, you'll see how impudent il Signor Bakunin is becoming.
507 This fellow now has control over 4 organs of the International (Egalité, Progrès in Locle, Federacion, Barcelona, and Eguaglianza, NAPLES).
He is trying to gain a foothold in Germany through alliance with Schweitzer, and in Paris through flattery for the newspaper Le Travail.
He believes the moment has come to start an open squabble with us.
He is playing himself up as the guardian of real proletarianism.
But he's in for a surprise.
Next week (luckily the Central Council a has adjourned until the Tuesdayb after New Year's Day, so we on the SUBCOMMITTEE are free to work without the cosy intervention of the English) we shall be sending a threatening MISSIVE to the Romance Federal Committee0 in Geneva, and since the gentlemen know (incidentally a major part, perhaps the greater part are against Bakunin) that, according to the resolutions of the last Congress, we can suspend them if necessary,508 they will consider the matter twice.
The main point on which our MISSIVE turns is this: the only representation with regard to us of the branches romandes en Suisse 6 is the Federal Committee there.
They have to dispatch their demandes andreprimandestouspRivATELY,throughtheir secretary,Perret.
Theyhaxe absolutely no right TO ABDICATE THEIR FUNCTIONS INTO THE HANDS OF THE Egalité (a NONEXISTENCE for us), and to expect the Central Council to get involved in public explanations and polemics with this remplaçant.
Whether or not the rejoinders of the General Council are published in the organs of the international branches, the whole thing depends on the decision of the General Council, which alone is directly responsible to the Congress.
At this opportunity, blows will fall upon certain intrigants who are usurping undue authority, and who wish to subject the Internation­ al to their private control.
Regarding the tumult of the Cossacks' about the Bulletin, the matter is as follows: It was decided at the Brussels Congress13S that we should publish 'IN THE SEVERAL LANGUAGES' bulletins on STRIKES etc.

17 December 1869 405 (THE GENERAL COUNCIL) MEANS PERMIT'.
509 But on the condition that we, for our part, received reports, documents, etc.
, from the FEDERAL comités at least every 3 months.
Since we have received neither these reports nor the MEANS to print reports, this resolution naturally remained a dead letter.
In fact, it became superfluous as a result of the founding of numerous international newspapers, which exchange with one another (Bee-Hive as register of English STRIKES, etc.
).
At the Congress in Basle,379 the question was raked up again.
The Congress treated the Brussels resolutions on the Bulletin as NON-EXISTENT.
Otherwise, it would simply have charged the Central Council with carrying them out (which would, once again, without the provision of MEANS, have remained a lettre morte*).
At issue was a bulletin in a different sense (not, as before, a resume of STRIKES, etc.
, but RATHER GENERAL REFLEXIONS ON THE MOVEMENT).
The Congress did not, however, come to a vote on this point.
There is, therefore, at present no resolution IN THIS QUESTION.
But what a marvellous policy it would be to inform the public, through an open reply to Egalité that, at an earlier date, the Brussels resolutions remained unfeasible, 1.
because the MEMBERS did not pay their PENCE, and 2.
because the FEDERAL comités did not perform their functions! With regard to Schweitzer, Mr Bakunin, who understands German, knows that Schweitzer and his gang do not belong to the International.
He knows that Schweitzer publicly rejected Lieb-knecht's offer to appoint the General Council as arbiter.
294 His interrogation is all the more villainous since his friend Ph.
Becker, the president of the German language groups,510 sits on the Geneva FEDERAL COUNCIL, in order to give them the necessary informa­ tion there.
His aim is simply to gain a grip on Schweitzer.
Mais il verra! h I have written fully to De Paepe c about the affair (to lay before the Brussels Central Committee).
As soon as a Russian gets a foothold, there is the devil to pay.

9 January 1870 407 277 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 9 January 1870 Dear Moor, A Happy New Year! I arrived back here at midday on Thursday, after thoroughly wrecking my stomach in Barmen with innumerable guzzlings.
513 The people there are overjoyed, that is, the philistines are.
The danger of war has now been finally overcome; Louis-Napoleon has once again finely maintained his superior wisdom through prudent compliance.
514 Bismarck is once again able to work, confidence is returning, COMMERCE must improve, and so 1870 must be an extremely blessed year for the honest German duffers.
I cannot grasp how these people manage to take leave of more of their senses every year.
Hühnerbein, the old tailor and general of the revolution, was very pleased to see me.
He still has a complete set of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung bound in red, which is good to know.
He sends greetings; he has two very pretty daughters.
I did not go to Solingen 3 for the following reasons: 1.
It would have been very difficult for me to get away for a day at HOLIDAY time; 2.
I could not very well have asked for a closer look at the business without contributing a larger sum myself, which was not possible and 3.
as a Party friend, I would have been forced to take the people's word for some things, and not to have insisted so strictly, like a complete stranger, on the presentation of all documents and SECURITIES; and Menke, as a result of my report, would perhaps refrain from sending anyone, and thus load me with a responsibil­ ity I would prefer to decline.
Now I shall wait for your reply and then wiite to the people.
b If I hadn't been so wrecked and, in addition, worried about Lizzie, whom I left unwell, and from whom I heard nothing all the time, I would have dropped in on you on the return journey.

c It's a ghastly business.
Keep on with the arsenic till all the symptoms have disappeared, and then for at least another 3 months.
I shall go to Gumpert in the next few days and ask him for his opinion,d but be so good as to let me know first for how long you stopped taking the arsenic, and when you began again, so I can answer his very first question.
I would have thought you really must realise that in the interests of your 2nd volume, ' too, you need a change of life-style.
If there is a constant repetition of such suspensions, you will never get finished; with an increase in movement in fresh air, which will keep off the carbuncles, then sooner or later.

409 Unfortunately, now that I can no longer call upon the packers in the WAREHOUSE I haven't such opportunities for sending wine as formerly.
I must wait, as with Brauneberger, until I find a ready-packed crate, or depend somehow or other on chance.
That is why the small crate of port I am sending you today, has proved so slim.
It is an old butter crate from Renshaws; I could not get more than 5 bottles in the narrow space, and the thin boards would not have stood more weight.
It should keep you going for a while, however.
The Peter Bonaparte business is a bang-up inauguration for the new era in Paris.
3lb Louis3 is décidément unlucky.
For the bourgeois a very rude awakening from the illusion that the whole foundation of corruption and dirty work, carefully and slowly constructed over eighteen years, would disappear immediately noble Ollivier took over the helm.
Constitutional Government with such a Bonaparte, such generals, prefects, police and Decembrists! The anxiety of the fellows, I mean the bourgeois, is nowhere more clearly expressed than in Prévost-Paradol's letter in Monday's Times.
5^ The worst part of this business is that Rochefort thereby acquires a quite exaggerated nimbus.
To be sure, though, the official Republicans are also a miserable lot.
John Bright deserves congratulations.
The poor fellow is so helpless in his new and elevated situation that, despite all discretion, he promises the Irish FREE LAND and OPENING OF THE PRISON DOORS.
118 The latter naturally only to revoke it the following day, as soon as the slightest attempt is made to take him at his word.
As far as FREE LAND is concerned, this was already—in Bright's sense, à la FREE TRADE—introduced by the ENCUMBERED ESTATES COURT.
I have at last discovered a copy of Prendergastc in a local library, and hope to be able to obtain it.
To my good or bad fortune, the ancient Irish laws481 are now also appearing, and I shall have to wade through these as well.
The more I study the subject, the clearer it becomes to me that, as a result of the English invasion, Ireland was cheated of its whole development, and thrown back centuries.
And this ever since the 12th century; neither should it be forgotten, of course, that 300 years of invasion and plunder by the Danes had already dragged the country considerably backwards; but this had ceased more than 100 years earlier.

At the end of last month, an abscess of the gland began to form near the armpit.
I neglected the thing, and I am punished for my sin.
Several days after I sent the letter to Brussels,512 the a See this volume, p.

-b immediately 16* pain became intolerable and I fell into the hands of doctors.
I underwent two operations, and I feel better, but I am still being treated and must stay at home.
In the first place, I am writing this letter to ask you a personal favour.
You probably know that a part of the English bourgeoisie has formed a sort of LAND League521 against the workers' LAND AND LABOUR LEAGUE.
43' Their ostensible purpose is to transform English landed property into small-lot property, and to create a peasantry for the greater benefit of the people.
Their real purpose is an attack against landed aristocracy.
They want to throw land in free circulation in order to transfer it in this way from the hands of LANDLORDS into those of capitalists.
To this effect, they published a series of popular tracts under the title of Cobden Treaties, in which small-scale property is painted in rosy colours.
Their great battle-horse is Belgium (principally the Flemings).
It would appear that in that country the peasants live under paradisiacal conditions.
They established contact with Mr Laveleye who provides them with facts for their rhetoric.
In the meantime, as I treat of landed property in Volume Two of Capital,1*1 I believe it useful to go into some detail there on the structure of landed property in Belgium and of Belgian agriculture.
322 Will you have the goodness to send me the titles of the principal books which I must consult523? My illness has naturally prevented me from attending the General Councila in the last weeks.
Yesterday evening, the subcommittee (the executive committee) of which I am a member visited me.
Among other things, they communicated to me the content of a letter sent by Mr Hins to Stepney.
As Stepney believed that I would be able to attend the session of the General Council (on 25 January), he did not communicate to me any extracts from that letter.
I do not know any of it except from h")24 earsay.
In the first place, it is probably believed in Brussels that the catastrophe of Geneva, the change in the staff of L'Egalité, 523 was produced by resolutions of the General Council.
b That is an error.
Jung was so busy with his work as watchmaker that he did not find the time to copy the resolutions and dispatch them to Geneva before 16 January.
In the interval, he received two letters from H.
Perret, secretary of the Romance Committee.
The first letter, dated 4 January, is official.
It is a communication of the Romance Committee to the General Council stating that some editors of •' See this volume, p.

The second letter, of a later date but arriving also before the resolutions of the General Council were dispatched by Jung, is a confidential letter sent by Perret to Jung, I am giving you literal extracts from it to put you in the picture.
As the letter is private, I need not tell you that these extracts must not be communicated to the Belgian Committee or that the name of the writer must remain a secret.

Bakunin has left Geneva.
So much the better.
Those kind of people bring discord among us.
He was the head of the Alliance?51 These democrats are authoritarians, they do not want any opposition; such are Bakunin, Perron and Robin; these three were at the head of L'Egalité.
Bakunin, with his personal attacks, cost us 200 or 300 subscribers in Geneva.
Robin is even more authoritarian, his ambition was to change everything here; he has not succeeded, we do not wish to allow ourselves to be dominated by these gentlemen who believe themselves to be indispensable.
They attempted to bring pressure to bear on the Federal Committee, and that did not succeed; we do not want to engage in adventures with them or to bring discord in our sections.
Please believe me that l'Alliance is dangerous for us, especially now.
As for their plan in Geneva, I guessed it a long time ago: to let the men of l'Alliance move to the top of all the societies in order to dominate the Federation.
If you knew their mode of action—denigrating at the sections the people who do not let themselves be dominated by them; they did everything to push my candidature out of the way in Basle, the same thing in Grosselin.
.
.
You see the manoeuvre—sending to Basle no one but members of the l'Alliance, Heng, Brosset, Bakunin.
That did not succeed at all.
Besides, he a worked on the delegations at Lyons, at Naples; these methods are not ethical.
They left for Basle before us to prepare their intrigues.
.
.
Here is something that happened at the Congress, something I guessed about but had no certain proof of.
Martinaud, delegate of the Neuchâtel section, had a mandate signed by the brother of Guillaume, 52,7 a forged, false mandate — we have proof of that in our hands.
The Neuchâtel section was not yet definitively constituted, and the provisional committee wrote to us not to recognise either Guillaume or Martinaud.
These are the morals of the apostles of l'Alliance, for Guillaume and some others from Locle are their friends.
Besides, the creation of Progrès has lured away subscribers to L'Égalité, although our journal was founded by all and we must support it.
'The last bit of news: the cut-throats of l'Alliance have just handed in their resignation from L'Égalité —Perron, Robin and some others, more or less capable ones.
A little coup d'état à la Bakunin and à la Robin.
They wanted to force the hand of the Federal Committee, that it might dismiss from the staff a member b who offered opposition and who condemned attacks made against various committees and the General Council.
We do not wish to increase the authority of these gentlemen, we are going to have a quiet fight with them yet, but it seems that l'Alliance loses many of its members; it is diminishing—so much the better.
' Mikhail Bakunin -b Pierre Waehry So much for the extracts from Perret's letter.
If Mr Hins has not yet communicated my letter (and the resolutions of the General Council) to the Belgian Council, 512 it would be better to suppress entirely the paragraph about Bakunin.
I have no copy of it, but I know that I wrote it in irritation brought on by physical suffering.
Thus I do not doubt that Mr Hins justly blames me for the form of that paragraph.
As to the substance and the facts, they are independent both from my bad manner of expression and the good opinion of Mr Hins about Bakunin.
The fact is that l'Alliance, of which Bakunin is the creator and which has not been dissolved except nominally, is a danger to the International Association and an element of disorganisation.
In the paragraph concerning Bakunin, I am told that Mr Hins again picks up the phrase 'le bonhomme Richard'.
" That is a SLIP OF THE PEN, which I regret all the more as Richard is one of the most active members of the Association.
I used the phrase only to say that, in the correspondence cited here, he accepts with a great deal of simple-mindedness opinions which he never fathomed.
Besides, when I wrote those words, Richard had just given a fresh proof of his thoughtlessness.
He had sent to the Council a letter in which a judgement was expressed declaring certain persons belonging to a would-be schismatic Lyons branch to be infamous traitors expelled from the Association.
We are asked to copy this judgement, to stamp and sign it, and to return it by post.
And that without proof, without documents, without giving those condemned the right to defend themselves.
I am also told that Mr Hins reproaches the English Report on the Basle Congress b for having suppressed everything related to the question of heritage.
That is obviously a misunderstanding.
On pages 26-29 we find the report of the General Council/ the report of the committee appointed at Basle, and a summary of the discussion on this question.
Moreover, the English Report on the transactions of the Congress was written by Eccarius.
The Council appointed a commission to examine that report.
Although I was appointed a member of this commission, I refused to take part in its work as I had not been present at the Congress and was thus not competent to judge the exactness of the report.
My entire collaboration was restricted to purely stylistic improvements.

In view of your decisively anti-lymphatic temperament, the involvement of the gland (axil­ laris) can only be secondary and not mean anything.

The business was complicated to some degree by small carbuncles near the abscess, nearly the size of an egg.
But IN A FEW DAYS ALL WILL BE QUITE RIGHT.
It is curious how doctors have differing opinions.
Dr Maddison, who was employed in Edinburgh in a hospital for skin diseases, and still works in this branch, in addition to his practice in a London hospital, states that in both hospitals they are completely against arsenic for carbuncles, though use arsenic for rashes.
As long as I am in his care, which comes to an end this week, I naturally take his medicine.
As soon as this finishes, I shall take arsenic regularly for 3 months for il faut en finir* Enclosed—the announced note from Wilhelm.
520 If you write to him, do inform him, in passing (referring to the screed he sent you for me) that 1.
if all newspapers write as much about the 18th Brumaire as his, b that is to say, not at all, it is not surprising that nobody hears of it; and 2.
that if this material cannot be obtained in Leipzig (which I regard as humbug), he should not write to me, but to Meissner direct.
Enclosed—letter from Dr J.
Jacoby to Kugelmann, and note from Kugelmann.
The matter is as follows: Kugelmann saw in supplement No.
18 of Zukunft (22 January) a SPEECH by Jacoby, in which the latter avows socialism and, in the main part of the same issue, the story of the meeting at which this happened, when Schweitzer seized the presidency with the help of his bullyboys and, after the end of Jacoby's speech, accused him, inter alia, of borrowing arguments from me.
Kugelmann wrote with his usual fervour to Jacoby on this, congratulating him and, at the same time, dressing him down for quoting all sorts of people, but precisely not me, who had supplied him with his real matter.
HT 524 ENCE JACOBY'S REPLY.
' The odd thing is only that Jacoby—during the meeting, in answer to Schweitzer—said that I myself 'utilise in my works the labours of my predecessors on countless occasions'.
Since I conscientiously cite everybody who contributed as much as a comma to the exposition, this means that Jacoby can take the substance of his new beliefs from me, without citing me.
In addition, I am not a 'predecessor' of 70-year-old Jacoby.
A mere populariser and superficialiser has no 'predecessors'.
Yet despite all this, it is very fine that Jacoby, like Arnold Ruge, has been converted to communism.

It is very clear why the old Yid did not name you; he was sheepishly ashamed of himself, but he should at least have known that, once Schweitzer had been elected president, or was simply present, the plagiarism would certainly be rammed down his throat; but an old wiseacre like he always thinks, in his stupidity, that things might go well.
If conversions continue like this, we shall soon dislodge old almighty God from the Rhenish proverb which states that he 'keeps curious company'.
I shall try to raise subsidies for the Democratic News.
12-fold subscriptions can lead to nothing, as we have simply no use here for the piles of waste paper.
And I don't know, either, what could be reported from here.
I shall inform Wilhelm suitably; I presume he has never spoken in his sheet b about the 18th Brumaire.
That not a single copy can be obtained in Leipzig is certainly a lie, unless the whole edition has a See the previous letter.

Apropos, how do things stand with the French translation of it, and of your book580? I shall send Wilhelm the Peasant War, but shall only write the introduction for the complete publication.
There is no sense in writing an introduction for a serial publication that might drag on for 6 months or more.

Flourens, no blow was struck at Noir's funeral.
The fury of Pays shows the Bonapartists'3 great disappointment.
They could not wish for anything better than to catch all the revolutionary masses of Paris en flagrant délit h on the open field outside Paris, even outside the fortifications, which only have a few passages.
Half a dozen cannon at the posterns, an infantry regiment in skirmishing order, and a brigade of cavalry to lay about and pursue—and, in the space of half-an-hour, the entire unarmed crowd—the few revolvers some might carry in their pockets would not count—would be routed, cut down or captured.
Since they have 60,000 soldiers, they could even let them enter the fortifications, occupy these, shoot down with grapeshot and ride down the crowd in the open terrain of the Champs Elysées and on the Avenue de Neuilly.
Delightful! 200,000 unarmed workers should, from the open field, conquer Paris occupied by 60,000 soldiers! The French newspapers arrived this morning.
Best thanks.

8 February 1870 284 ENGELS TO KARL KLEIN AND FRIEDRICH MOLL IN SOLINGEN Manchester, 8 February 1870 86 Mornington Street, Stockport Road Dear Friends, I must apologise very much for having left your letter of 3 December unanswered until today.
498 My only excuse is that I wanted to write something really nice, so I had to look around first, also in the interests of the cooperative.
If I now have no very good news, this is, as you will see, not my fault.
I remember Solingen well from anno 48 and 49.
Not only were the workers of Solingen at that time the most developed and most determined in the Rhine Province, as was also shown by the Elberfeld affair; I have a reason to be personally grateful to them, since the Solingen column, with which I marched to Elberfeld, supported me and guarded me there against the cowardly and treacherous Committee of Public Safety of the bourgeois 'radicals'.
Had it not been for the Solingers, these bourgeois would have bunged me into jail, where I would probably have been left as an expiatory sacrifice for the Prussian gentlemen.
532 And I know full well that, during the whole period of the Lassallean triumphal processions, the Solingers did not behave as disciples of the new teaching, but as people who had belonged to the socialist movement for many years, who could, of course, join the new Association, 104 but did not need to learn anything from it.
And I know very well, how, when Lassalle was being idolised as a new messiah, Friend Klein had the courage to remind him and the workers that the people round the Neue Rheinische Zeitung had already contributed something towards the independence of the workers.
466 Thus, it is doubly painful to me that my own means do not permit me to give the cooperative a helping hand in a way that would be of special use to it.
The little money I have is so tied up that, with the best will in the world—and certainly for the next few years at least — I cannot get at it, not even for my personal ends.
I can thus only dispose of my income, which is not brilliant in the circumstances here.
But to show my good will, at least, I enclose 50 thaler in one Prussian banknote I.

8 February 1870 421 however, should be credited not to me, but to the reserve fund of the cooperative.
Together with Marx, with whom I have discussed the matter,3 I have looked around to see whether we might drum up money for the cooperative in some other way.
Marx knows some people who have means, and who can be assumed to have good will.
But the manb through whom we would have to manoeuvre this is away for a number of months, and until then nothing can be done.
We intend to do the following: if we succeed in interesting these people in the matter, we shall ask them to send somebody to Solingen to inspect the state of the cooperative himself.
It would then be necessary for this person to be shown all the books and records and be provided with all the necessary explanations with the greatest frankness.
Otherwise, you cannot ask people to put money into a business and, if I were myself in a position to advance a larger sum, then I would come to Solingen and ask for the same.
In business matters everybody has the duty to look out for himself, since anybody can make a mistake, particularly somebody who is interested in a certain thing.
In addition, such a person—who naturally would be a complete stranger to Solin­ gen—would have to give his word of honour that he would make no use of the information thus obtained.
And when this person has convinced himself of the reliability of the business and the trustworthiness of the management, we hope a decent sum will be taken up in bonds.
I naturally give you this simply as our plan of operations, and would not like you to set great hopes in it already, as it is clear that we cannot just dispose of other people's money.
I would not for the world wish the cooperative, basing itself upon such prospects, which might come to fruition at the earliest in months, or perhaps not at all, let itself in for transactions that would tie up its means, and get it into difficulties.
I can only promise that we shall do our best in this matter, and remain, with best wishes for the success of the cooperative and the prosperity of all members, with greetings and a handshake Frederick Engels My address is now as above.

During the last years of his life he still made himself noticeable with his fanaticism against Darwin.

I have read the first 150 pages of Flerovsky's bookd (taken up with Siberia, North Russia and Astrakhan).
This is the first work to tell the truth about Russian economic conditions.
The man is a determined enemy of what he calls 'Russian optimism'.
I never held very rosy views about this communist El Dorado, but Flerovsky surpasses all expectations.
It is, in fact, rum, and at any event sign of a change, that something like this can be published in Petersburg.

Blazing hatred of LANDLORD, capitalist and official.
No socialist doctrine, no mysticism about the land (although he favours the form of communal property), no nihilistic extravagance.
Here and there a certain amount of well-meaning twaddle, which is, however, suited to the stage of development of the people for whom the book is intended.
At all events, it is the most important book published since your work on the Condition of the Working-Class.
And the family life of the Russian peasants is also well depicted—with the awful beating-to-death of their wives, the drinking, and the concubines.
It would, therefore, be very opportune if you would send me the fantasy-lies of Citizen Herzen.
3 You will recall that Égalité, inspired by Bakunin, attacked the GENERAL COUNCIL, made all sorts of interpellations publicly, and threatened more.
b A communicationc —which I composed—was, thereupon, sent to the Comité Romand in Geneva, and ditto to all the other Comités of French tongue corresponding with us.
Result: The entire Bakunin gang has quit Egalité.
Bakunin himself has taken up residence in Tessin, and will continue intriguing in Switzerland, Spain, Italy and France.
Now the armistice is at an end between us, since he knows that I attacked him heatedly and inveighed against him on the occasion of the latest Geneva événements? The brute really imagines that we are 'too bourgeois' and, therefore, incapable of grasping and esteeming his lofty cohcepts about 'inheritance right', 'equality', and the replacement of the present state systems by 'l'Internationale'.
Nominally, his 'Alliance de la Démocratie Socialiste' 2'7 has been dissolved, but, in fact, continues.
From the enclosed copy of a letter (which you must return to me) from H.
Perret, secrétaire du Conseil Romand, to Jung, 530 you will see that, in fact, the catastrophe in Geneva took place before they received our communication there.
This, however, strengthened the new status rerum.
c The Belgian 'Conseil' (Brussels) has officially declared itself completely in favour of our stand against Egalité, but the secrétaire of the Belgian COUNCIL, Hins (brother-in-law of De Paepe, but fallen out with him), has sent a letter to Stepney 324 in which he takes Bakunin's side, accuses me of supporting the reactionary party amongst the Geneva workers, etc.

In any case, it shows that something is not quite kosher about your lymphatic system.
If the business does not clear up soon, I would ask Allen, who made such a correct prognosis about my glandular business.

He didn't know at all that the 18th Brumaire had been published.
On the other hand, / should immediately send him my address.
Since he had no longer sent me his sheet, his excuse is that / must have left my address.
And now this penance—belatedly throwing the whole Volksstaat from 1 October onwards at my head! I would ask for the earliest return of these two documents, so I might send Wilhelmchen what he wants and have him leave me in peace.
Today I returned to you, per Globe Parcel Co.
, all copies of Cloche, Lanterne, Marseillaise, Figaro, etc.
that I had here.
The relevant number of Cloche is among them.
535 Since Jennychen collects these things, it is best if she has them all together.
I have only kept one Marseillaise here, containing the business about the guncotton 539; I wish to examine Chlormeier3 further about it.
Dakyns wanted to visit you before Christmas, and wrote to Moore for your address.
He, whose insight into character and sense of judgement is not, however, always unexceptionable, gave him such a picture of your inaccessibility at home that I said immediately that poor Dakyns would be quite unnecessarily intimidated.
So I wanted to give you Dakyns' address last time, but forgot; but I told Moore immediately that he should not put such nonsense into Dakyns' head.
The sentence quoted from Flerovskyb is the first Russian sentence I have understood completely without a dictionary.
What is the Russian title of the book? I shall acquire it for myself.
What I wanted to send you was not Herzen, but the German translation of 3eMJiH u eojin, Land and Freedom, by the aristocrat Lilienfeld, 0 which also describes the bad results of freedom for the peasants, and the resulting decay of agriculture.
631 I wrote to you about this more than a year ago,d and since then Borkheim has also acquired it and, I believe, translated passages from it for you.
As soon as I have read it through, I'll send you it.
Ferret's letter536 also returned, enclosed.

Then it soon becomes possible to demonstrate to the world that it is all gas.
And this is better than if the struggle stays in the field of private gossip, in which people who have something to do are never a match for those who have the whole day for forming cliques.
But an eye must be kept on the fellows, so they do not manage to occupy the field somewhere or another without resistance.
Spain and Italy will have to be left to them, of course, at least for the time being.
It would be a very good thing if Mr Rochefort, or as Lizzie says RUSHFORTH, were to go missing in prison for a while.

It still has in its bones the whole quality of its origins in the bas-empire!' And when Rochefort preaches unity of the bourgeois and the worker, it is even funny.
On the other hand, the 'serious' leaders of the movement are, for their part, really comically serious.
It is truly marvellous.
The SUPPLY of heads, which, until '48 the proletariat obtained from other classes, appears to have dried up completely, and in all countries.

12 February 1870 288 MARX TO ENGELS 174 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 12 February 1870 DEAR FRED, Allen visited me yesterday.
Nothing but a simple chill.
He advised me, however, to continue my house arrest until the Russian wind 'WHICH BLOWS NO GOOD TO ANYBODY' ceases.
Your introduction3 is very good.
I know of nothing that should be altered or added.
I agree verbotenush with your treatment of 1866.
The double thrust at Wilhelm 0 of the People's Party 38 and Schweitzer, with his bodyguard of ruffians, is very pretty.
Regarding the EXCUSES made by Wilhelm, 538 one never knows whether he is lying intentionally, or whether everything is revolving in confusion like a mill-wheel in his head.
The FACT is that I wrote to Meissner from Hanover that he should send COPIES' 1 to Wilhelm, Zukunft and Schweitzer, and the latter immediately published a detailed announcement.
0 Additionally: Wilhelm's friends—Bonhorst and Bracke —saw the new edition when they visited Hanover,' and told me that they had reached agreement with Meissner on the publication of a cheaper, popular edition.
Meissner wrote to me about it.
I agreed this edition should consist of 2,000 copies, of which 1,000 should be supplied to Bonhorst, etc.
, at cost price.
They pledged themselves to see to the placing of this 1,000.
I've heard nothing about the matter since.
We should now put Wilhelm to the test.
Write to him that he should write to Meissner, asking how it is that he has not advertised the 18th Brumaire either in Volksstaat or in Zukunft, and ditto, despite my instructions from Hanover, why he has sent neither him nor Weiss of Zukunft COPIES? The reply from Meissner would, at the same time, give me an opportunity to have a serious word with the latter about his sloppiness.

44S One of the things that amuses me very much in Flerovsky is his polemic against the peasants' direct dues.
It is a complete reproduction of Marshal Vauban and Boisguillebert.
d He also feels that the situation of the country people has its analogy in the period of the old French monarchy (since Louis XIV).
Like Monteil,e he has a great feeling for national characteristics—'the straightforward Kalmyck', 'the Mordvinian, poetic despite his dirt' (whom he compares to the Irishman), the 'agile, epicurean, lively Tartar', the 'talented Little Russian', etc.
Like a good Russian, he tells his fellow-countrymen what they should do to turn the hatred all these races feel for them into the opposite.
As an example of the hatred, he cites, for instance, a genuinely Russian colony from Poland which moved to Siberia.
These people know only Russian, not a word of Polish, but they regard themselves as Poles, and foster a Polish hatred of the Russians, etc.

12 February 1870 COURSE only hastened the process of disintegration, and that fearful social revolution is at the door.
Here, too, you see the real roots of the schoolboy nihilism that is now the fashion among Russian students, etc.
In Geneva, BY THE BY, a new colony of exiled Russian students has grown up with a programme proclaiming opposition to pan-Slavism, which should be replaced by the 'Interna­ tional'.
541 In a special section, Flerovsky demonstrates that the 'Russifica­ tion' of alien races is a sheer optimistic delusion, even in the East.
You don't need to send me Lilienfeld.
" Gaudissartb has it in Russian and German.
He announced his return to me the day before yesterday.
According to an earlier communication from his wife to mine, he had found a new post.
But it surprises me that he doesn't mention this in his latest epistle.
Enclosed, it must be returned, a copy of the letter from Hins to Stepney? In my reply d I gave the fellow a thorough dressing down.
The exact manner in which he informs himself is shown by the following points, amongst others.
He says that, in our Report on the Basle Congress" we suppressed the discussion on the right of inheritance.
Bakunin probably palmed this off on him, and he believes it, although he has our Report in his hands and knows enough English to read it! He speaks of 'my' letter to Geneva, though I have not addressed a line there! My expostulation about Bakunin's goings-on is in my letter to Brussels, in which—apart from communicating the missive of the GENERAL COUNCIL to Ge­ nevaf — I had to give a general report and communicate the appointment of a new secretary for Belgium (Serraillier, ouvrier bottier g from Marseilles).
He accuses us of having provoked the crisis in Geneva which —as Egalité shows—ended more than a week before our MISSIVE arrived there, etc.
The Belgian Conseil Général* has, despite Hins, declared its full agreement with us.

344 I really don't know what the Tories could have against this BILL, which is so indulgent with the Irish LANDLORDS, and finally places their interests in the tried and trusty hands of the Irish lawyers.
Nevertheless, even this slight restriction of the eviction right will result in an end to the excessive emigration, and will put a stop to the conversion of arable land into pasture.
But it is very jolly if the worthy Gladstone should think that he has abolished the Irish question by means of this new prospect of endless procedure.
Is it possible to get a copy of the BILL? It would be very important for me to be able to follow the debates on the individual clauses.
You in London can have no idea of the way the telegraph has broken down since it was taken over by the Government.
Only the first third of Gladstone's speech was published in yesterday's papers here, and even this was pure nonsense!' The LATEST TELEGRAMS are all 24 hours later than before, so that, if you want to know something, you have to wait for the London newspapers to arrive.
A telegram from here to Nottingham, handed in on Thursday, arrived Monday.
You know that, for the past 3-4 years, there has been a big squabble between Prussian and Austrian historians about the Peace of Basle,545 because Sybel claimed that Prussia was forced to conclude it because it had been betrayed by Austria in Poland/ Now Sybel once again has a long story about it, from the Austrian 11 Albert Edward -b Gladstone's speech in the House of Commons on 15 February 1870 was published in The Times, 16 February and in Manchester Daily Examiner and Times, 17 February 1870.

17 February 1870 433 archives, in his Historische Zeitschrift:' Every line proves how Russia set Prussia and Austria at each other's throats and, at the same time, drew them into the 1792 war against France, exploited, cheated and dominated both; but stupid Sybel notices nothing of this; instead searches in this whole filthy murk of cheating, treaty-breaking and infamy, in which they were all equally involved, for only one thing: proof that Austria was even more rascally than Prussia.
Never have there been such blockheads.
His wrath is not directed against Russia, no, solely against Austria, and he explains Russian policy, which is displayed here quite openly and clear as day, with childish motives, such as annoyance at Austrian double-dealing.
From Flerovsky's accountb it apparently emerges that Russian power is bound to collapse very shortly.
Urquhart will, of course, say that the Russians had the book written in order to throw dust in the eyes of the world.

I would prefer it if you were to obtain a confirmation of posting certificate when you send the book off, and send me same.
You would also oblige me if you would let me know roughly when C.
Hirsch wrote to you about Vogt The pamphlet you sent me is one of the appeals currently being made by the privileged estates of the German-Russian-Baltic provinces to German sympathies.
These canaille, who have always distinguished themselves with their zeal in the service of Russian diplomacy, army and police, and who, since the transfer of the provinces from Poland to Russia, have happily bartered their nationality for the legal right to exploit their peasantry, are now clamouring because they see their privileged position endangered.
The old system of rank and estate, orthodox Lutheranism and bleeding the peasants—that is what they call German culture, to defend which Europe should now mobilise.
Hence, too, the last words of this pamphlet— landed property as the basis of civilisation, and landed property, moreover, as the wretched pamphleteer himself admits, consisting mainly of directly manorial estates or tributary peasant estates.
In his quotations—in as far as they refer to Russian communal property—the fellow displays both his ignorance and CLOVEN FOOT.
Schédo-Ferroti b is one of the fellows who (naturally IN THE INTERESTS OF LANDLORDISM) attribute the miserable situation of the Russian peasantry to the existence of communal property, just as, formerly, the abolition of serfdom in Western Europe, instead of the serfs' loss of their land, was decried as the cause of pauperism.
The Russian book Land and Freedom is of the same calibre.
The author is a Baltic country squire von Lilienfeld c The Russian peasantry is thrown into misery by the same thing that made the French peasantry miserable under Louis XIV, etc.
— state taxation and the obrokd to the big landowners.
Instead of producing the misery, communal property alone diminished it.
It is, further, a historical lie that this communal property was Mongolian As I have indicated at various points in my writings,546 it is of Indian origin, and may, therefore, be found among all European peoples at the beginning of their development.
The specific Slav (not Mongolian) form of the same in Russia (which is also repeated amongst the non-Russian South Slavs) even re-a K.

17 February 1870 435 semblés most, mutatis mutandis, 3 the Old German modification of Indian communal property.
The Pole Duchinski in Paris declared the Great Russian race to be Mongolian and not Slav, and attempted to prove this with a great expenditure of scholarship; and from the standpoint of a Pole, this is in order.
Even so, it is wrong.
Not the Russian peasantry, but only the Russian aristocracy, is strongly mixed with Mongol-Tartar elements.
The Frenchman Henri Martin has taken over the theory from Duchinski, and the 'enthusiastic Gottfried Kinkel' translated Martin 547 and set himself up as a Polish enthusiast, in order to make the Democratic Party forget his servile homage to Bismarck.
On the other hand, the fact that the Russian state represents Mongolianism in its policy towards Europe and America is naturally a truth that has today become a platitude, and thus accessible even to people like Gottfried and Baltic country squires, philistines, clerics and professors.
Despite everything, therefore, the Baltic-German cries of dismay must be exploited, since they place Prussia, the German great power, in a 'ticklish' position.
Everything that arouses antipathy on our side towards these 'representatives of German culture' in Prussia's eyes is bound to make it appear worth protecting! Another example of the crass ignorance of the pamphleteer: he sees the cession of Russian North America as no more than a diplomatic ruse by the Russian Government, which incidentally WAS VERY HARD PRESSED FOR COSTS.
548 But the main point is this: the American Congress recently published the documents about this transaction.
They include, among other things, a report by the American envoy, in which he writes explicidy to Washington: the acquisition is at the moment not worth a cent economically,—but England is, thereby, cut off from the sea on one side by the Yankees, and the reversion of the whole of British North America to the UNITED STATES thus accelerated.
There's the rub! I approved of the substance of your correspondence with Jacoby, but I was absolument shocked by the exaggerated praise of my activities.
Est modus in rebus! c If you must praise, Old Jacoby himself is worth praising.

1928 291 MARX TO ENGELS 180 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 19 February 1870 DEAR FRED, Although it is still very inopportune to go out in the evenings in such weather, nevertheless I visited Gaudissart' yesterday evening.
He had, you see, written to me that he had something very important to tell me, and could not really drag the files to me.
And what was it? A giant letter about Russica, an impossible omnium-gatherum rambling on from one thing to another, with which he had honoured Zukunft? 14 and which this had not printed; neither had he received an answer to his furious letter requesting 'an explanation' of such methods.
Further: a letter from the publisher d of Hermann here, requesting him to write against Russia for his paper.
It would thus appear that Bismarck is very cross about Katkov's attacks.
Finally, an article in Katkov's paper" in which he 1.
makes" insinuations against Bakunin concerning various money matters; 2.
describes him as his Siberian correspondent; 3.
charges Baku­ nin with having written an extremely humble letter to Emperor Nicho­ las, from Siberia or shortly before being sent there—I don't re-a Gertrud Kugelmann -b Kugelmann's daughter Franziska -c Sigismund Bork-heim -d Heinemann -c MocKoecmn ehàoMocmu 291.

Gaudissart has business again, but not yet a new OFFICE in the CITY.
He also has to get the BUSINESS going again.
This evening—although yesterday evening did me no good—I must go into town again.
I have been SUMMONED to the SUBCOMMITTEE.
It is, in fact, an important matter, since the people in Lyons have thrown Richard out of their society, though the GENERAL COUNCIL must make the decision.
Richard, hitherto LEADER in Lyons, a very young man, is very active.
Apart from his INFEODATION to Bakunin and a super-wisdom linked with this, I don't know what reproaches can be made against him.
It appears that our last circular letter11 caused quite a sensation and that a hunt for Bakuninists has started in both Switzerland and France.
But est modus in rebus? and I shall see to it that there is no injustice.
550 The best bit of Gladstone's speechc is the long introduction, where he states that even the 'BENEFICENT' laws of the English always have the opposite effect in practice.
What better proof does the fellow want that England is not fit to be lawgiver and adminis­ trator of Ireland! His measures are a pretty piece of patchwork.
The main thing in them is to lure the LAWYERS with the prospect of lawsuits, and the LANDLORDS with that of 'state aid'.
Odger's election scandal was doubly useful: the lousy Whigs have seen, for the first time, that they must let workers into Parliament, or Tories will get in.
Second, the lesson for Mr Odger and consorts.
Despite Waterlow,551 he would have got in if part of the Irish workers had not abstained, because he had behaved so TRIMMING during the debate in the GENERAL COUNCIL, which they found out from Reynolds's.

in the lurch, in order to participate in the second partitioning of Poland excluding them.
The filthy behaviour of the Prussians on that occasion was already disclosed in a Polish publication of 1794, which I have read in German translation, and the very clumsy way in which Russia made the two great German powers into its TOOLS and FOOLS in the anti-Jacobin war is very well set out in a Polish pamphlet, written in French in 1848.

The very minimum of the Russian Railway Loans amounts to 100 mill.
£St.
This sum has been mainly raised in Holland, Frankfort on the Main, London, Berlin, and Paris.
As appears from the Moscovite public journals, the Russian government intends raising, if possible, in the course of the next two years, no less than 50 mill.
£St.
In regard to the last Railway Loan of 12 mill.
^St.
, its history comes to this: As you will be aware, the Russian government had successively, but vainly tried to raise money, first by Thompson and Bonar, then by Baring.
Being hardly pressed for money, it succeeded at last to get from Rothschild, acting through his agent Bleichrb'der at Berlin, a loan of something like two millions £St.
With a view to get further securities for the repayment of this loan, Rothschild undertook to bring out the last Railway Loan.

19 February 1870 439 He stipulated 1) 4 per cent commission for himself—which, on 12 mill.
£St.
, amounts to the nice round sum of 480,000 £St.
; 2) another 5,000£ to be annually paid to him for 80 years for his trouble of paying out the coupons.
Rothschild proceeded very cautiously.
He limited the English share of the loan to but 4 mill.
£St.
, part of which he took up on his own account, while the rest was placed exclusively with confederate stockjobbers and City friends.
Thus, when the loan was thrown on the open market, it was mere child's play to push it quickly to 4 per cent premium.
Still Rothschild's anticipations were quite surpassed.
So floated was he with applications that he expressed his regret of not having at once issued a loan of 20 mill.
£St.
The present financial distress of the Russian government may be inferred from the following facts: About a year ago the Russian government issued a 'series' of paper money to be refunded after a certain term of years, and amounting to 15 mill, roubles.
The official pretext of this new issue was that by this operation 15 mill, roubles of the old paper assignats should be withdrawn from the market and replaced by a more solid sort of currency.
But hardly had the 'series' been issued in the way of state payments, when the Petersburgh Official Gazette" declared in a short, dry note that, for the present, no paper assignats would be withdrawn.
During the few last months, the Russian government has again issued no less than 12 new 'series' of that new sort of paper money, amounting together to 36 mill, roubles.

North German consul, he would most probably have learned that a debt contracted abroad is not recoverable by legal action in Scotland—or should Scotland be an exception to all other countries? On superannuation, the Code Civil states, Article 2262, that all plaints are superannuated after 30 years; Article 2265: who acquires something in good faith—superannuation in 10, respectively 20 years 557; Article 2271: the plaint of masters and teachers of sciences and arts regarding instruction given monthly, superannuates in 6 months.
Since this last article does not correspond to the case, the plaint has obviously been filed simply in order to interrupt the superannuation in Rhenish Prussia, or also to see if Imandt can be browbeaten by fear of showing himself up, and will thus pay.
His counter-bills are possibly made out on word of honour, in which case he could be shown up badly, in his position.
Under Article 2244 a court summons interrupts the superannuation.
Katkov's elucidations about Bakunin are not worth much.
a He does not say to whom the repentant letters were supposedly sent.
Borrowing money is such a normal Russian means of sustenance that no Russian should reproach another on the subject.
And that Bakunin should have used the 6,000 roubles lent him in order to flee, instead of paying the otkupschtschik,h is really ludicrous.
And that somebody banished to Siberia should once turn to Katkov, although otherwise he has no time for him—one can't make much of that either.
It will annoy Bakunin, but I can't see that Gaudissart0 will dig much capital out of it.
You can tell Gaudissart concerning his plan regarding Flerovsky that, if an English publisher is interested, he will find himself a translator who will translate AT THE MARKET RATE, which differs considerably from what Gaudissart calls 'paying well', and who will finish it in 2-3 months, and not take a whole year.
Gaudis­ sart should not think that he is the only person who knows Rus­ sian.
There will still be time to return to the other points when he has really found a publisher.
Incidentally, it won't hurt at all if Gaudissart makes enquiries amongst the London PUBLISH­ ERS.
If he should find somebody, which I hardly believe, this contact could be utilised at a later date.
You can easily refuse the preface, saying it would be arrogant of you to wish to intro­ duce a foreign book to English literature, before you yourself a See this volume, p.

147 Apropos, why don't you put Eccarius on to tackling the foul prison deeds in Volksstaat? Sybel, of course, does mention the second partitioning of Poland behind Austria's back," but, at the same time, he tries to prove once again that Prussia was entitled to do this, on account of some sort of previous Austrian treachery.
His entire reasoning is this: when Prussia allies itself with Russia against Austria, this is in order, but if Austria attempts to ally itself with Russia against Prussia, this is treachery.
The Pan-Germans and Austrians—Arneth, Vivenot and consorts—claim the opposite; so the two schools of history-mutilators today behave just as stupidly with regard to Russia as the two German powers did then.

On superannuation the Code Civil states," Article 2262, that all plaints are superannuated after 30 years; Article 2265: who acquires something in good faith—superannuation in 10, respec­ tively 20 years; Article 2271 : the plaint of masters and teachers of sciences and arts regarding instruction given monthly, superan­ nuates in 6 months.
The whole officiousness of the Prussians is obviously simply an attempt to browbeat you, and you can just laugh in the fellows' faces.
It would only be inconvenient if the counter-bills are made out on word of honour.
This would not alter things legally, but would be compromising.
But this is surely not the case? As you perhaps know, Dronke went bankrupt in a big way, then disappeared.

5 March 1870 445 in which this wretched rag addresses itself to its 'liberal' brothers in France, and warns them not to lump the CASES OF Rochefort and O'Donovan Rossa together.
The Marseillaise really fell into the trap, saying The Daily News was right, and in addition published a wretched article by that prattler Talandier, exprocureur de la République, now a teacher of French at the military school in Woolwich (and also ex-private tutor at Herzen's, about whom he wrote a glowing obituary); in this article he attacks the Irish because of their Catholicism, and accuses them of causing Odger's defeat—because of his participation on the Garibaldi committee.
561 Besides, he adds, they still support Mitchel although he has sided with the SLAVEHOLDERS, as though Odger did not continue to side with Gladstone, despite his much more important support for the 4351 SLAVEHOLDERS ! Jennychen —ira facit poetam*—therefore wrote, in addition to a private letter, an article for Marseillaise, which was printed? 62 And she received, from the rédacteur de la rédaction, a letter, a copy of which I enclose.
Today she'll be sending another letter to the Marseillaise which, referring to Gladstone's reply (this week) to questions about the treatment of the PRISONERS, contains extracts from O'Donovan Rossa's letter (see The Irishman, Feb.
5, 70).
According to Rossa's letter Gladstone is here presented to the French as a monster (insofar as Gladstone is, IN FACT, responsible for the entire treatment of the PRISONERS, under the Tories, too) and also as a ridiculous hypocrite, as author of the Prayers, The Propagation of the Gospel, The Functions of Laymen in the Church, and Ecce Homo.
With these two papers—the Internationale and Marseillaise—on the Continent we shall now unmask the English.
If you should happen, ONE DAY OR THE OTHER, to find something suitable for one of these papers, you, too, should take part in our good work.

c However that may be, and despite his spite against the 'race noire'd —(to such people it is always a source of satisfaction to have somebody they think themselves entitled to mépriser') —he declares 'le nègre' ou 'le sang noir' 1 to be la source matérielle de l'art,* and all artistic production of the white nations to depend on their mixture avec 'le sang noir'.

There is something besides.
To accelerate the social development in Europe, you must push on the catastrophe of official England.
To do so, you must attack her in Ireland.
That's her weakest point.
Ireland lost, the British 'Empire' is gone, and the class war in England, till now somnolent and chronic, will assume acute forms.

441 The book of Flerovski on 'the situation of the labouring classes in Russia',b is an extraordinary book.
I am really glad to be now able to read it somewhat fluently with the aid of a dictionary.
This is the first time that the whole economical state of Russia has been revealed.
It is conscientious work.
During 15 years, the author travelled from the West to the confines of Siberia, from the White Sea to the Caspian, with the only purpose of studying facts and exposing conventional lies.
He harbours of course some delusions about la perfectibilité perfectible de la Nation Russe, et le principe providentiel de la propriété communale dans sa forme Russe.
c But let that pass.
After the study of his work, one feels deeply convinced that a most terrible social revolution—in such inferior forms of course as suit the present Muscovite state of develop­ ment—is irrepressible in Russia and near at hand.
This is good news.
Russia and England are the two great pillars of the present European system.
All the rest is of secondary importance, even la belle France et la savante Allemagne.

298 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 7 March 1870 Dear Moor, Your letter arrived here yesterday3 in a very suspicious state and, what is even more suspicious, a full hour after time.
Since, on Sunday, there is only one POST DELIVERY here, this looks very odd.
Is the very honourable Mr Bruce taking an interest in our corres­ pondence? When I read on Saturday afternoon in the 'Irishman in Paris' the story about the Marseillaise, I knew immediately in which part of the world Mr Williams was to be found, but stupidly enough could not explain the Christian name.
566 The business is very fine, and the naïve letter, with Rochefort's naïve suggestion that O'Donovan Rossa should be asked to contribute to the Marseillaise, gives Jenny an excellent opportunity to establish a link with the treatment of the prisoners, and to open the eyes of the bons hommes b over there.
Why don't you publish the General Council's letter to the Genevansc? The central sections in Geneva, Brussels, etc.
, read these things, but they do not penetrate to the masses unless they are published.
And they should also be published in German in the papers in question.
You don't publish anything like enough.
Please send me the relevant copies of Marseillaise and Inter­ nationale for a few days.
d Jennychen's success has been greeted with a general hurrah here, and Mr J.
Williams' health has been drunk with ALL DUE HONOURS.
I am very eager to hear how the matter develops.
The stupid correspondent of the 'Irishman in Paris'6 should try some time to get such things into his friend Ollivier's papers.
A couple of days ago my bookseller suddenly sent me the Senchus Mor, the ancient Irish laws,481 and what's more, not the new edition but the first.

19,13 Published in English lor the first time 301 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 10 Marchc 1870 DEAR FRED, Since I know this stuff amuses you, the following with all haste (post just closing): in addition to a few introductory marginal notes on Gladstone's latest declaration in the House of Commons about the PRISONERS, Jennychen sent the Marseillaise an extract from an older letter by O'Donovan Rossa, published in The Irishman on 5 February (I believe that was the date).
The Marseillaise (in a truly French way it gives this letter as from 'Newgate') proceeds to publish this in a special issue on Tuesday evening, containing only articles by 'prisonniers politiques' and costing 50 centimes.
571 This has now been reprinted (re-translation into English) this evening in The Echo, etc.

The Irishman may well complain that it is not quoted as the source.
But Jennychen will use this to demonstrate how the English press suppresses the FACTS published in the Irish press, and only publishes them as such when they come from Paris in some extraordinary manner.
The English press will soon note that the idyllic days of systematic lying and hushing up the FACTS are over.
Pays remarks that the increase in the price of the Marseillaise to 50 c.
is against all the rules, since 'prison goods are always sold cheaper than others'.

Williams" has certainly had a bang-up and well-earned success.
The dodge by the Marseillaise in printing the letter as an originalb has got the whole English press into a fine pickle, and has finally forced The Irishman to admit its debt to the Marseillaise and the Internationale.
The hushing-up is at an end, and MR Bruce—although in the lousy Daily News he again has O'Donovan Ros-sa described as 'ORDINARY CONVICT AND NOTHING ELSE'—will probably sing quite a different tune in answering the interpellations that are to come.

The whole week I have been standing ready to have to go away because of my mother, but luckily things are getting better.
6 The following passage suffices to characterise gentle old Gladstone's whole long LAND BILL544 as pure muck: 'THE LEASES IN QUESTION' (namely, as they are given today, now and then, in Ireland by the LANDLORDS to the TENANTS) ' ARE QUITE AS PRECARIOUS AS TENANCIES AT WILL.
THEY HAVE NO EFFICACY WHATEVER IN REMOVING THE SENSE OF INSECURITY.
A LEASE TO BE OF ANY AVAIL FOR THAT PURPOSE, SHOULD, SAVE IN THE PARTICULARS OF SUBDIVIDING AND SUBLETTING, BE FREE AND UNFETTERED—ABOVE ALL, IT SHOULD PUT IVO OBSTACLE TO THE SALE OF THE TENANT'S INTEREST.
BUT MODERN LEASES ARE THE REVERSE OF THIS—THEY ARE ENCUMBERED WITH CLAUSES AND COVENANTS PRESCRIBING THE MODE OF CULTIVATION AND THE DISPOSAL OF THE PRODUCE, NEGATIVELY AND AFFIRMATIVELY REGULATING THE ACTION OF THE TENANT AND ENTIRELY FORBIDDING THE ESSENTIAL POWER OF FREE ALIENATION.
EVERY LINE IN THESE DOCUMENTS MAY WITHOUT MUCH EXAGGERATION BE SAID TO CONTAIN A LEGAL PITFALL FOR THE UNWARY AND THERE ARE FEW, INDEED, IF ANY, WHO CAN ESCAPE THE EFFECT OF THE LAST CLAUSE WITH WHICH THEY WIND UP, MAKING VOID THE LEASE IN CASE OF THE BREACH OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COVENANTS.
SUCH LEASES AFFORD NO SECURITY.
THEY ARE QUITE AS PRECARIOUS AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN TENANCIES AT WILL.
' And who says this? MR Gallwey, AGENT (11) OF THE Kenmare ESTATE, AT THE Killarney BOARD OF GUARDIANS, 4 November, 1869.
And the Kenmare ESTATE belongs to MARQUIS OF Landsdowne, whose general agent for all his Irish ESTATES is the honourable 'REALITY' Trenchl1 One could not hope for a better authority.
And these LEASES are the contracts BY WHICH, AFTER THE PASSING OF THIS BILL, EVERY IRISH TENANT IS TO BE HELD BOUND according to the noble Gladstone.

17 March 1870 457 303 ENGELS TO JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) IN LONDON Manchester, 17 March 1870 Dear Jenny, I congratulate you on your well-earned success.
573 That Mr Bruce had to stammer his apologies in yesterday's Daily News is priceless.
574 It will now be necessary to show up the hollowness of these apologies, and that is not difficult.
Here is some material, as I do not know whether you still have a copy of the Pollock and Knox Report* about THINGS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.
Bruce says: 'WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMPLAINT THAT HE WAS COMPELLED TO BATHE IN UNCLEAR BATHS, THE COMMISSIONERS, AFTER FULL INQUIRY INTO THE PRACTICE OF THE PRISON, SAY "IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DWELL UPON SUCH ABSURDITIES.
"' What do the Commissioners say? PAGE 23: 'AT BATHING HOURS, HE STOOD NO.
1 OF A PARTY OF 30, HE WAS NOT CALLED FIRST TO THE BATH.
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE WARDER IN CHARGE ON ONE OCCASION BEGAN WITH NO.
1, NEXT WEEK WITH No.
30; THE 3RD WEEK HE TOOK No.
16 AND 17 FIRST AND WORKED ROUND TO THE FLANKS SO AS TO GIVE EACH HIS PRIORITY, WITHOUT WHICH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIVERSAL DISCONTENT.
IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DWELL ON SUCH ABSURDITIES' b THUS,THE ABSURDITY does not consist in fact that it is stated that Rossac had to bathe in the dirty water of criminals.
No, but in the fact that he complains about it.
Bruce changes the fact (admitted by the COMMISSIONERS) in such a way as if they had treated it 'as an absurdity'.
That's the way Bruce treats the truth.
On the fact itself, the CONVICT of Clonmel explains (THINGS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN, p.
9) .
'IT IS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN THAT WE HAD TO BATHE IN THE SAME WATER IN WHICH SEVERAL OF THESE CRIMINALS BATHED OR WERE BATHING AT THE TIME.
' I might further remark that PENAL SERVITUDE is similar to the French travaux forcés or the so-called galères, and a CONVICT PRISON of this sort = the French bagne, and CONVICT = galérien.

d The sensation caused in Paris and London by Jennychen's second letter (containing the CONDENSED TRANSLATION of O'Donovan's LETTER) has robbed Talandier of his sleep; he is loathsome and importunate (but very FLUENT with gob and pen).
In the Marseillaise he had denounced the Irish as CATHOLIC IDIOTS.
Now, equally FULLMOUTHED, he is taking their side in a review of what The Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Daily News have said about O'Donovan's letter.
579 Since Jennychen's second letter was left unsigned (BY ACCIDENT), he obviously flattered himself with the idea that he would be taken for the secret sender.
This was frustrated by Jennychen's third letter.
The fellow is, du reste, TEACHER OF FRENCH AT THE MILITARY SCHOOL OF Sandhurst.
Last Tuesday" I was back again, for the first time, at a meeting of the GENERAL COUNCIL.
580 With me—Felix Holt, THE RASCAL.
' He had a very good time since, for a change, there was really something interesting going on.
As you know, the prolétaires 'positivistes' in Paris had sent a deputy 8 to the Basle Congress.
There was a discussion as to whether he should be admitted, since he represented a philosophical society and not a workers' society (although he and his consorts all belong 'personally' to the WORKING GLASS).
Finally, he was admitted as a delegate of personal MEMBERS of the 'Internationale'.
These fellows have now constituted themselves in Paris as a branche of the Internationale—an event about which the London and Paris Comtists have made a great FUSS.
They thought that they had driven in THE THIN WEDGE.
The GENERAL COUNCIL, being informed by the 'prolétaires positivistes' of their affiliation, reminded them politely that the COUNCIL could only permit their admission after examining their programme.
So they sent a programme—real Comtist-orthodox—which was discussed last Tuesday.

In fact, the beastly government could wish for no better medium than our correspondence in order to keep informed of the activities of the entire proletarian party; the government will also find things in our correspondence that they can utilise with their continental colleagues.
At least because of this we must take all precautions.
We must not correspond for Stieber's sake.
Jenny can shout: victoire sur toute la ligne! 3 If it were not for her, the honourable Gladstone would never have granted the new enquête^ How Moore c allowed himself to be diddled again by Gladstone concerning this enquiry can be shown by comparing the hopeful NOTE on p.

OLD Becker C has finally written to Jung (also a few lines to me,585 which I shall answer tomorrow).
He presents all the stupidities he committed as deep and intentional machiavellianism.
Le bon homme! d Thereby, the interesting datum that Bakunin, who hitherto, as Becker states, shouted blue murder about Herzen, began to sing hymns of praise as soon as he was dead.
D86 Thereby he achieved his aim, that the propaganda money, ABOUT 25,000 frs annually, which the rich Herzen had paid to himself from Russia (his party there), is now transferred to Bakunin.
Bakunin appears to love this type of 'inheritance', 087 despite his antipathy contre l'héritage.

24 March 1870 307 MARX TO WILHELM BRACKE 589 IN BRUNSWICK [London, 24 March 1870] Dear Friend, Yesterday3 I send you 3,000 CARDS OF MEMBERSHIP addressed to von Bonhorst590 I have information for you, which is not uninteresting, about the internal affairs of the Internationals.
This will reach you by an indirect route.
b In accordance with the Rules, all national committees in contact with the General Council must send it three-monthly reports on the situation of the movement.
When I remind you of this, I would ask you to consider that this report is not written for the public, and should, therefore, present the facts completely factually, without make-up.
From Borkheim and from the latest letter from Bonhorst I know that the finances of the Eisenachers are in a bad state.
591 As a consolation, the information that the finances of the General Council are below zero, steadily growing negative dimensions.

a I have heard nothing from Menke yet.
When you write to the lads, please tell them, also, 1.
that Lessner has written repeatedly to them that the Central Council* can do nothing on this matter; 2.
that they can work it out on their own 5 fingers that their cooperative society is of absolutely no interest to the English; and 3.
that the Central Council is bombarded from all parts of Europe with demands for money, without receiving financial contributions from anybody on the continent.
I don't understand your lines of this morning.
This is probably due to the fact that my head, as a result of physical infirmity, is not at its most lucid.
I would appreciate it if you could send me, tomorrow evening (if there is a post on Sunday, which is not the case here), £5 as an advance on the coming quarter.

The Moor First published in Pisma Marksa h Kugel-Printed according to the original manu (Letters of Marx to Kugelmann), Moscow-Leningrad, 1928 311 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 27 Marchb 1870 Dear Moor, If you did not understand my few lines of the day before yesterday, then the enclosure must have been missing.
You wrote on the 24th that you would take steps as soon as you had in your hands completely striking certain proof that our letters had been opened.
The envelope of this letter was the most striking proof: the sealing-wax had been loosened with a hot iron and afterwards spread just as sloppily back on the envelope, so that every trace of the imprint was blotted out, and the unfastened flaps were not even properly covered again.
So I immediately sent you this envelope, wishing thus to put you in a position to take immediate steps.
If it was not enclosed, it had been taken out.
But if it was in the same state in which you dispatched it, then you obviously need not put any sealing-wax on the letters, and might just as well send them completely open.
Since this case interests me, please tell me how things stand.
a I would ask you to greet Madame la comtesse from me, and thank her for the friendly lines she wrote me.
She has not the slightest reason to regret preferring Latin to French.
This not only displays a classical and highly-developed taste, but also explains why Madame is never non-plussed.

27 March 1870 Luckily, I have money at home, and I send you enclosed £5, S/7, 29,808, Manchester, 16 January 1869, BANK OF ENGLAND NOTE.
Unfortunately, because of Sunday I cannot register the letter; the rogues who open our letters are equally capable of stealing the money.
I wanted to get the rest yesterday, but the bank closes so early on Saturday that I wouldn't have got into town in time.
I'll get it tomorrow.
I don't remember seeing the Queen's Messenger with Clan-ricarde's biography.
" As far as I know, I sent back to you all the Queen's Messengers, etc.
, which you did not take with you personally, in the parcel with the Cloches and Lanternes; but I'll take another look.
Mr Philipp von Roesgen von Floss has also spread himself in the Werker several times; the really Dutch, precise handwriting suggests a come-down notary's clerk.
Caution is suggested before he be granted the personeel diploma as lid b of the Internationale If your friend Collet only knew that you also have now become a bona fide and frank RUSSIAN AGENT.
01 But it's really quite nice of the fellows, who certainly seem to be a different sort of Russians from those we have previously encountered.
They can be left with their project of playing patron to the other Slavs until a firm footing has been gained in Austria and Hungary, and then this will cease of itself.
They also have a good picture of the Servian Omladina; it is a sort of student society with tendencies about as clear as those of the old Burschenschaft.
596 The explanation about Bakunin very good.
Thus he is also rendered harmless, since the Russian paymasters will not permit him to go further than Herzen.
You must be having worse weather than us; here it's fairly cold, and the wind veers between northwest and east, but otherwise it's mostly fine, and I can take a decent walk every day.
But 8 days ago, when it was once warm, I got a frightful grippe, which I drove out with 3 days of linseed tea.
I shall send you back the Dutch and Russian letters with the second post, so you'll get them tomorrow afternoon.

9 April 1870 471 314 MARX TO SIGFRID MEYER AND AUGUST VOGT 174 IN NEW YORK London, 9 April 1870 Dear Meyer and dear Vogt, So here you have me in all postures, one time together with my eldest daughter Jenny.
Kugelmann had all these things printed from earlier photograms.
a Je ne suis pas l'auteur responsable de ces folies.
b First of all, with regard to my long letter-debt to you, you will see from the enclosed note from Eccarius that the General Council has passiert^ a votum OF CONDOLENCE 598 because of the state of my health.
(You see, I am practising Pennsylvanian German.
) In fact, because of repeated relapses, I have only been able to attend the meetings of the General Council twice since the beginning of December, so, for all important discussions, the SUBCOMMITTEE came to my place.
Under these circumstances (and I am still not completely restored), my free moments have literally been so absorbed by work that my correspondence has been limited to the completely unavoidable.
First, ad vocem d Sorge: he has written two letters to Eccarius as General Secretary.
Eccarius informed the General Council of this.
The latter instructed Eccarius to deliver the letters to me for answering, as I was Secretary for the German branches in the UNITED STATES.
I tarried intentionally, as I knew that Meyer was on a trip to the West Indies, and could not find Vogt's private address.
I do not know Sorge's private letters to Eccarius.
They probably deal simply with the money question, payment to Eccarius for his contributions to the Arbeiter-Union.
Eccarius regards his position as General Secretary too much as a means of making money, and in a way that compromises us Germans in the eyes of the French and English.
See, for instance, the enclosed note to me from Lessner.
3" This is also the reason that I shall not communicate Meyer's letter to Eccarius,600 since it conveys the information, irresistible to Eccarius, that Sorge has 'pecuniary resources'.

Marx to Meyer and Vogt.
9 April 1870 With regard to Sorge's two official letters, they are written in the name of the General German Workers' Association 'LABOR UNION' No.
5, and signed Corresponding Secretary.
One letter contains orders for the reports of the General Council, and various other commonplace stuff.
The other letter contains nothing essential except for the notification that the association has joined the 'International'.
I shall write a few lines to Mr Sorge today, sending him the 15 COPIES of the latest report he requests.
" A certain Robert William Hume (Astoria, Long Island, New York) sent us a detailed letter some time ago, on the occasion of the decisions of the General Council concerning the Irish amnestyb— a letter better than anything we had so far received from English-American circles.
On my recommendation, he was named American-English correspondent, and has accepted this.
I would, therefore, request you to get into contact with this man, and for this purpose I enclose a few lines addressed to him.
From the enclosed cutting from the Marseillaise of 2 April, you will see that F.
Carl and F.
Jubitz—persons unknown to us here—have sent an address to Paris in the name of the German workers.
601 I would like to know whether these people belong to you.
What was regarded as dubious here—on the General Council — was the fact that the International was not mentioned at all, but rather treated as non-existent.
General Cluseret has offered himself from New York to the General Council as French correspondent.
Whether he was accepted I cannot say, believe I have heard so, however.
He is a flighty, superficial, officious, boastful fellow.
For instance, in one of his latest letters to the Marseillaise' he presents himself as a recognised representative of the workers of New York.
But the man is of a certain importance for us just because of his links with the Marseillaise.
In case you should wish to get to know this 'hero', even if only to sound him out, I enclose for you a CREDENTIAL, which might also be OF USE elsewhere.
The money Meyer sent to Stepney has been delivered to the General Council.
Stepney is a very pedantic, but honest English­ man.
He sent me the letter from Meyer with enclosures, so I had to send the stuff back to the General Council.

9 April 1870 473 The day after tomorrow (11 April) I shall send you what International things I have at hand.
(It is too late for the mail today.
) I shall, ditto, send more of the 'Basle'.
a Amongst the stuff sent, you will also find a few copies of the RESOLUTIONS of the General Council of 30 November on the Irish amnesty, which you already know, and which I initiatedb; ditto an Irish pamphlet on the treatment of FENIAN CONVICTS.
0 I had intended to submit further RESOLUTIONS on the necessary transformation of the present Union461 (i.
e.
, enslavement of Ireland) IN A FREE AND EQUAL FEDERATION WITH GREAT BRITAIN.
Further progress on this matter has been temporarily suspended AS FAR AS PUBLIC RESOLUTIONS GO because of my enforced absence from the General Council.
No other member of it has enough knowledge of Irish affairs or sufficient prestige with the English members of the General Council to be able to replace me on this matter.
Time has not passed uselessly, however, and I would ask you to pay particular attention to the following: After studying the Irish question for years I have come to the conclusion that the decisive blow against the ruling classes in England (and this is decisive for the workers' movement ALL OVER THE WORLD) cannot be struck in England, but only in Ireland.
On 1 January 1870 d the General Council issued a secret circular, written by me in French6—{for repercussions in England, only the French papers are important, not the German} —on the relationship of the Irish national struggle to the emancipation of the working class, and thus on the attitude the International Association must take towards the Irish question.
Here I give you, quite shortly, the salient points.
Ireland is the BULWARK of the English landed aristocracy.
The exploitation of this country is not simply one of the main sources of their material wealth; it is their greatest moral power.
They represent, IN FACT, the domination of England over Ireland.
Ireland is, thus, the grand moyen 1 by which the English aristocracy maintains its domination in England itself.

Marx to Meyer and Vogt.
9 April 1870 On the other hand: if the English army and police were withdrawn from Ireland tomorrow, you would immediately have AN AGRARIAN REVOLUTION IN IRELAND.
But the overthrow of the English aristocracy in Ireland would entail, and would lead immediately to, its overthrow in England.
This would bring about the prerequisites for the proletarian revolution in England.
In Ireland, the land question has, so far, been the exclusive form of the social question; it is a question of existence, a question of life or death for the immense majority of the Irish people; at the same time, it is inseparable from the national question: because of this, destruction of the English landed aristocracy is an infinitely easier operation in Ireland than in England itself—quite apart from the more passionate and more revolutionary character of the Irish than the English.
As for the English bourgeoisie, it has, d'abord, 11 a common interest with the English aristocracy in turning Ireland into simple pastureland to provide meat and wool at the cheapest possible price FOR THE ENGLISH MARKET.
It has the same interest in reducing the Irish population to such a low level, through EVICTION and forced emigration, that English capital (leasehold capital) can function with 'SECURITY' in that country.
It has the same interest IN CLEARING THE ESTATE OF IRELAND as it had IN THE CLEARING OF THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS OF ENGLAND and SCOTLAND.
The £"6,000-10,000 ABSENTEE and other Irish revenues that at present flow annually to London must also be taken into account.
But the English bourgeoisie also has much more important interests in the present Irish economy.
As a result of the steadily-increasing concentration of leaseholding, Ireland is steadi­ ly supplying its SURPLUS for the English LABOUR MARKET, and thus forcing down the WAGES and material and moral position of the ENGLISH WORKING CLASS.
And most important of all! All industrial and commercial centres in England now have a working class divided into two hostile camps, English PROLETARIANS and Irish PROLETARIANS.
The ordinary English worker hates the Irish worker as a competitor who forces down the STANDARD OF LIFE.
In relation to the Irish worker, he feels himself to be a member of the ruling nation and, therefore, makes himself a tool of his aristocrats and capitalists against Ireland, thus strengthening their domination over himself.
He harbours religious, social and national prejudices against him.
His attitude towards him is roughly that of the POOR WHITES to the a in the first place 314.
Marx to Meyer and Vogt.
9 April 1870 475 NIGGERS3 in the former slave states of the American Union.
The Irishman PAYS HIM BACK WITH INTEREST IN HIS OWN MONEY.
He sees in the English worker both the accomplice and the stupid tool of English rule in Ireland.
This antagonism is kept artificially alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short by all the means at the disposal of the ruling class.
This antagonism is the secret of the English working class's impotence, despite its organisation.
It is the secret of the maintenance of power by the capitalist class.
And the latter is fully aware of this.
But the evil does not end here.
It rolls across the ocean.
The antagonism between English and Irish is the secret basis of the conflict between the UNITED STATES and England.
It renders any serious and honest cooperation impossible between the working classes of the two countries.
It enables the governments of the two countries, whenever they think fit, to blunt the edge of social conflict by MUTUAL BULLYING and, IN CASE OF NEED, by war between the two countries.
England, as the metropolis of capital, as the power that has hitherto ruled the world market, is for the present the most important country for the workers' revolution and, in addition, the only country where the material conditions for this revolution have developed to a certain state of maturity.
Thus, to hasten the social revolution in England is the most important object of the International Working Men's Association.
The sole means of doing so is to make Ireland independent.
It is, therefore, the task of the 'INTERNATIONAL' to bring the conflict between England and Ireland to the forefront everywhere, and to side with Ireland publicly everywhere.
The special task of the Central Counciln in London is to awaken the consciousness of the English working class that, for them, the national emancipation of Ireland is not a QUESTION OF ABSTRACT JUSTICE OR HUMANITARIAN SENTIMENT, but THE FIRST CONDITION OF THEIR OWN SOCIAL EMANCIPATION.
These are roughly the main points of the circular letter, which, at the same time, gave the raisons d'être for the resolutions of the Central Council on the Irish amnesty.
Shortly afterwards I sent a strongly-worded anonymous article on the English treatment of the FENIANS etc.
, and against Gladstone etc.
, to the International (organ of our Belgian Central Committee c in Brussels).
In this article I also pilloried the FRENCH REPUBLICANS—(the Marseillaise had •' See p.

9 April 1870 published some stupid nonsense about Ireland, written here by the wretched Tallandier 2)—for saving, in their national egoism, all their colères h for the Empire.
This worked.
My daughter Jenny wrote a series of articles for the Marseillaise under the name J.
Williams (she signed herself Jenny Williams in her private letter to the editors), and published, among other things, O'Donovan Rossa's letter.
HENCE IMMENSE NOISE.
After many years of cynical refusal, Gladstone was thereby finally compelled to authorise a parliamentary enquête' into the treatment of the FENIAN PRISONERS.
She is now REGULAR CORRESPONDENT ON IRISH AFFAIRS for the Marseillaise.
(This is naturally a secret between us.
) The British Government and press are furious that the Irish question has thus been placed on the ordre du jour d in France, and that these blackguards will now be watched and exposed all over continent, via Paris.
A second bird was hit by the same stone.
We have, thereby, forced the Irish leaders, journalists, etc.
in Dublin to establish contact with us, something the General Council had hitherto failed to achieve! You have a wide field in America for work along the same lines.
A coalition of the German workers with the Irish workers (naturally, also, with the English and American workers who wish to join in) is the greatest thing you could undertake now.
This must be done in the name of the 'International'.
The social significance of the Irish question must be made clear.
Next time, several special things about the position of the English workers.

" Some of them anticipated my wishes; others were new to me and very handy.
I am sending you several numbers of Zukunft to give you an opportunity to admire the infinitely foul methods used by the National Liberals in the debate on political crimes (Criminal Code).
This excels everything.
The cowardly rogues believe they have performed such a deed of heroism with the abolition of the death sentence for common crimes—and that, too, only on paper—that political offenders may now be calmly imprisoned in convict jails and treated as COMMON CONVICTS.
602 For political crimes, powder and lead will continue to exist, through the agency of martial law.
Enclosed—a jolly letter from Wilhelm, which I request returned for the sake of answering.
You will see that the fellow acts as though J were copying from him.
He has not yet firmly established his Leipzig sheet, b and already wants to start a daily in Berlin.
603 The fellow always sees the heavens filled with melodious violins,c but the strings are missing and the sounding-board is smashed.
After various interruptions I am finally finished with Wake­ field0—16-1700 pages quarto.
The book is gruesomely written and still more gruesomely printed—nearly all figures and dates are wrong—but, as far as the material is concerned, unequalled in my practice.
I have never before seen something so complete about a country.
And the fellow has eyes and is fairly honest.

I don't like such churlish sentimentality, and since Wilhelm is a born Darmstadt man and so has not, at least, the excuse that he is a born Westphalian, I have sent him a rather blunt reply.
In your article b he has intentionally overlooked the fact that the People's Party38 and the 'National Liberals' are treated as the two poles of the same narrow-mindedness.
On Tuesdayc I was at the Central Council* 1 for the first time once again, and took the opportunity to muster Pfänder, who had entered as a member once more (re-elected), but had not yet presented himself.

Schapper wanted to see me; Pfänder did not inform me of this, because I could not walk well as a result of the business on my thigh.
But I would have driven there if he had notified me.
On the same evening (Tuesday), Lessner reported that Schapper was in articulo mortis.
e I hope it is not as bad as that.

14 April 1870 479 While I am on medical matters, just this: I regard the latest outbreak simply as after-effects, which arrive with some regularity, and then disappear as the warm weather proceeds.
I believe, therefore, that I am finished with it for this year.
As always, however, the arrival of warmer weather has produced the liver complaint (or whatever it is), and for this I am gulping Gumpert's medicine.
Kugelmann claims that the only way to put me properly on my feet is to take the cure at Karlsbad 3 at the end of the summer.
The whole thing derives from poor nourishment, this from poor digestion, and this is connected with the fact that my liver doesn't function properly.
I would, therefore, ask you to question Gumpert about this.
But it would be better if you said that the Karlsbad proposal came from my English doctor, for the very name Kugelmann might induce him not to judge the case objectively, contrary to his inclination and conscience.
I feel that, in fact, some sort of decisive preventive measures must be taken, since one gets a year older every year, and this sort of infirmity is not helpful, either for ONE SELF or for ones outside effectiveness.
Did you know that Meyen had died? The copies of Zukunfth give, I must say, a fine picture of the Prussian-Liberal present.
But the Futureh will convert itself into the Present.
As Future the paper is really bankrupt.
In its new form, it comes under the sway of Sonnemann in Frankfort (with Weiss, as previously, as editor en chef).
It should represent, purely politically, the People's Party in Berlin.
Quelle imbécilité! c By abandoning its flirtation with the 'social question', it will complete­ ly lose its little bit of influence and circulation among the workers, and it will certainly not win over the Prussian, and especially Berlin bourgeois by a stronger South German coloration.
I enclose for you 2 Vienna workers' papers'1 and 1 Égalité, and request the return of all three after reading.

606 The presentation is very confused.
On Tuesday evening Jung informed us of the official report of the Geneva COUNCIL,6 written by the Russian Utine, who holds the function of secretary of the Romance Congress.
The anti-Bakuninists, 2,000 persons, were outflanked and thereby forced to secessio,c by the Bakuninists, consisting of 600 persons, who, however, per fas et nef as,A including forged mandates, made sure of a larger number of delegates.
There were stormy declarations about Bakunin's activities, which were exposed by Utine, among others.
The COUNCIL Romand now demands, on the basis of the resolution of the last (Basle) Congress, 508 that the Central Council decide.
We have replied: all FACTS, with the minutes of the meetings, must be sent here.
Ditto, we have commissioned Jung to write to Guillaume, so that he may, ditto, submit his vouchers.
Recently also we had to rule on a dispute in Lyons.
560 And finally, in Basle, one clique (under State Attorney Bruhin) has laid charges with us against the other (more proletarian one).
We have, however, referred the latter case, as completely local, to J.
Ph.
Becker as arbitrator.
In Paris Lafargue got to know a very learned Russian ladye (a friend of his friend Jaclard, an excellent young man).
She told him: Flerovsky—although his book' passed censorship at the time of the LIBERAL FIT—has been, if you please, banished to Siberia for the same.

The REPORTS of the POOR LAW INSPECTORS are interesting.
Like their Reports on Agricultural Wages, which are already in your hands, they show that the conflict between USOI/HKS ON THE ONE HAND, FARMERS and TENANTS on the other, began after the FAMINE.
607 AS regards the Reports on Wages—assuming the present figures on wages are correct, and that is probable, considering other sources—the former wage rates are either quoted too low, or those in the earlier PARLIAMENTARY RETURNS, which I'll look out for you in my PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS, were too high.

14 April 1870 481 what I stated in the section on Ireland608 is confirmed: that the rise in wages has been more than outweighed by that in food prices, and that, with the exception of the autumn period, etc.
, the RELATIVE SURPLUS of LABOURERS is properly established despite emigra­ tion.
Also important in the Landlord and Tenant Right Reports is the FACT that the development of MACHINERY has turned a mass of HANDLOOM WEAVERS into PAUPERS.
You would oblige me if you would tell me, quite shortly, about the BOGS, PEATS etc.
, of Ireland.
In all the BLUE BOOKS I have read, the BOG is sometimes situated on the mountain, that is on the mountain slope, but also sometimes on the plain.
What is the situation? What do the IRISH understand by TOWNLANDS"? It is clear from the two REPORTS of the POOR LAW COMMISSIONERS that 1.
since the FAMINE the CLEARING of the ESTATES of LABOURERS has begun as in England (not to be confused with the SUPPRESSION of the 40s.
FREEHOLDERS after 1829609).
2.
that the ENCUMBERED ESTATES PROCEEDINGS have put a mass of small usurers in the place of the TURNED OUT prodigal LANDLORDS (the CHARGE OF LANDLORDS '/6 according to the same REPORTS).
I would appreciate it if you and Moore could send me a few £s for Dupont.
His wife is in hospital with consumption.
He himself has been TURNED OUT of his old trade.
The excuse: his political opinions; the real cause: he made all the inventions, which his manufacturer appropriated.
For this reason, he has been persona ingrata h for a long time for him (he thinks he has sucked him completely dry).
But the Manufacturer has cut his own throat, so FAR as Dupont has made a quite new invention, which solves a problem that has existed for a long time in piano manufacture.
I have already given Dupont a few £s; since, together with his 3 small girls, he had been condemned to just dry bread.
It's only a matter of helping for a few weeks until he finds a new position.
Who can write the story of WORKINGMEN EVICTED because of inventions] And, in addition, the poor devil is also being HARASSED by the jealousy of the Paris people, and the slanders of the FRENCH BRANCH,72 who naturally immediately cornered Flourens.

In the meantime, I suggest you try taking strenuous walks—3-4 hours together—for several consecutive days and, WEATHER PERMITTING, walk at least 1-2 hours daily, and then every week such a long walk at least 1-2 times.
Now I can no longer work properly until I have walked for an hour or more; it has a wonderful effect and will certainly also get your liver more or less going again.

15 April 1870 483 Fränkelche3 is a real yiddisher lad.
He learned 'la formule' in Paris, and delivers good wares.
b It's delicious that he understands the frais généraux' as part of surplus value, including wear and tear of machinery, lubrication, coal (if this is not raw material), ground rent, etc.
BOGS are simply peat bogs or marshes, which occur in 2 main sorts of locality: 1.
on the plains, in valleys (old lake beds) or depressions, the exit from which has become blocked; 2.
on heights with a flat or mildly-rolling summit, as a result of deforestation, where the moss, grass, heather, etc.
, become matted, and the water flows off, on average, more slowly than it rains in.
A marsh in the plains sometimes even has a big river flowing through it, which, however, does not dry it out (various places on the Shannon, Donaumoss in Bavaria, etc.
).
Very usually such bogs are also the source reservoirs of rivers (the Bog of Allen, from which there flowed, in its original but now very reduced size, the Boyne, the Barrow, various tributaries of these two, and the Shannon).
Chat Moss, between Liverpool and Manchester, which you know, is a real, typical Irish BOG, as Wakefieldd confirms.
It lies at least 30-40 feet above the Mersey and Irwell, which flow around it in a semicircle, so drainage very easy, yet this is only about 7s done, and they've been at it since 1800.
This is because of the landlords; such an object can naturally only be drained systematically and compulsorily.
They have them in Holland too—peat bogs are the same all over Europe.
The Irish name those on the plain RED BOG and the mountain [bog] BLACK BOG.
Water trickling down can produce on the slopes—even very steep, 30-40 degrees—similar marshy places which, in time, produce peat.
On steep slopes it's naturally only thin; on flatter ones it can get thicker and thicker.
The thickest, naturally, is on the flat summits.
TOWNLANDS are the lowest administrative divisions in Ireland, which are everywhere based on the old Irish CLAN divisions, and in the north and the west these have mostly been retained unchanged.
The counties represent the local dukedoms (Donegal, the realm of THE O'Donnell, who then had others under him, e.
g.
, THE Mac Swine and his people.
Tyrone is that of THE O'Neill, Fermanagh that of THE Maguire, etc.
).
The baronies represent the individual CLANS, and in these the ballybetaghs (as Davies writes itc) or, translated into English, TOWNLANDS, the individual village bounds, 11 Leo Frankel -b See this volume, p.

15 April 1870 held jointly by the inhabitants.
In Ulster, for example, these have been completely retained in their old boundaries; in other parts more or less.
The PARISH, the POOR LAW UNION and other special English divisions, were later inserted between BARONY and TOWNLAND.
Your conclusions from the PARLIAMENTARY REPORTS a agree with my results.
It should not, however, be forgotten that, in the first period after 1846, the process of CLEARING the 40SH.
FREEHOLDERS609 was mixed up with the CLEARING OF LABOURERS, the reason being that, up to 1829, in order to produce FREEHOLDERS, LEASES FOR 21 or 31 YEARS AND A LIFE (if not longer) had to be made, since a man could only become a FREEHOLDER if he could not be turned out during his lifetime.
These LEASES almost never excluded SUBDIVIDING.
These LEASES were partly still valid in 1846, respectively the consequences, i.
e.
, the peasants were still on the ESTATE.
Ditto, on the estates then in the hands of MIDDLEMEN (who mostly held LEASES for 64 years AND THREE LIVES, or even for 99 years); these estates often only reverted between 1846 and 1860.
Thus, these processes ±b ran mixed up, respectively the Irish LANDLORD was never, or seldom, in a situation of having to decide whether particularly LABOURERS, rather than other traditional small TENANTS should be cleared.
Essentially it comes to the same thing in England as in Ireland: the land must be tilled by labourers who live in other POOR LAW UNIONS, SO that the landlord and his tenant might be spared the pauper-rate.
611 This is stated by Senior, or rather by his brother Edward, POOR LAW COMMISSIONER in Ireland: THE GREAT INSTRUMENT WHICH is CLEARING IRELAND is THE POOR LAW.
Land sold since the ENCUMBERED ESTATE COURT amounts, according to my notes, to as much as V5 of the total; the purchasers were indeed largely usurers, speculators, etc.
, mainly Irish Catholics.
Partly, also, GRAZIERS who had become rich.
Yet even now there are only about 8-9,000 landowners in Ireland.
What do you say to the way the whole European bourgeoisie has made itself a laughing-stock, by pledging itself to the empire liberal, and lately awarding laurels to Louis Bonaparte for his sincere transition to constitutionalism? And now it comes to light that he means this so sincerely that he explicitly reserves for himself, for the suitable moment, the right to a coup d'état, vulgo a plebiscite.
612 Nobody should be able to say that he had overthrown the constitution for a 2nd time.

616 Let him give to the new section he is about to establish no sectarian 'name', either Communistic or other.
Il faut éviter les 'étiquettes' sectaires dans l'Association Internationale.
0 The general aspirations and tendencies of the working class emanate from the real conditions in which it finds itself placed.
They are therefore common to the whole class although the movement reflects itself in their heads in the most diversified forms, more or less phantastical, more or less adequate.
Those who interpret best the hidden sense of the class struggle going on before our eyes—the Communists are the last to commit the blunder of affecting or fostering sectarianism.
Mr Verlet would do well to put himself in communication with our friend Jules Johannard, 126 rue d'Aboukir.

Marx to Paul Lafargue.
18 April 1870 One thing which ought to be done as quickly as possible, and which might be done by Paul-Laurent, is to publish in the Libre pensée a true and literal translation of the International Rules.
3 The French current translation, emanating from our first Paris Committee, Tolain et Co.
, is full of intentional mistakes.
They suppressed everything which they did not like.
If a true translation was made, it would be well to send it me before its publication.
617 In Germany people would much wonder at Verlet's appreciation of Büchner.
bM8 In our country he is only considered, and justly so, as a vulgarisateur.
You know how much I admire le 'Roman de Conspiration'^ I was, therefore, truly delighted to see it so well appreciated by Paul-Laurent.
I am now forced to say a few words which Paul-Laurent will a little fret at, but I cannot help doing so.
Your father wrote me a letter to Hanover which I have not yet answered, because I did not know what to say.
I feel quite sure that Paul has discarded all notion of finishing, or occupying himself with, his medical studies.
When at Paris I wrote to his father in a different sense, and I was warranted in doing so by Paul's own promises.
d Thus I am placed in quite a false position towards M.
Lafargue aine.
" I cannot remain in that fix.
I see no other prospect of getting out of it but by writing to him that I have as little influence with his beloved son as himself.
If you see any other way of escape for me, any other means of clearing my position, please communicate it to me.
In my opinion, which however I neither pretend nor hope to see accepted and acted upon, Paul-Laurent cum figlio* ought to pay a visit to their parents at Bordeaux and try to coax them by the many means personal intercourse permits of.
Yours truly.

621 Meanwhile I call your attention to the presence in your committee3 of Robin, Bakunine's agent who, at Geneva, did all in his power to discredit the General Council (he attacked it publicly in the Égalité) 507 and to prepare la dictature de Bakounine sur l'Association Internationale.
He has been expressly sent to Paris there to act in the same sense.
Hence this fellow must be closely watched without becoming aware of having a surveillant at his side.
622 In order de vous mettre au courant 11 I must give you a succinct review of Bakunine's intrigue.
Bakunine does not belong to the International but for about lV2 years.
C'est un nouveau venu.
d At the Berne e Congress (September 1868) of the Ligue de la Paix et de la Liberté f271 (he was one of the executive committee of this International middle-class Association founded in opposition to the proletarian International) he played one of the mountebank parts he delights in.
He proposed a series of propositions, stupid in themselves, but affecting an aim of swaggering radicalism calculated to frighten les crétins bourgeoise 23 In that way, being outvoted by the majority, he made his noisy exit from the League and had this great event triumphantly announced in the European press.
He understands la réclame^ almost as well as Victor Hugo qui, comme Heine dit, n'est pas simplement égoïste, mais Hugoïste} 1 Then he entered our Association—its Geneva branche Romande.
1 His first step was a conspiracy.
He founded l'Alliance de la Démocratie Socialiste.
The Programme of that society 257 was nothing else but the series of resolutions proposed by Bakunine on the Berne Peace League Congress.
' The organisation was that of a sect with its head-center at Geneva, constituting itself as an a the Paris Federal Council -b Bakunin's dictatorship in the International Associa­ tion -c to acquaint you with the matter -d a novice -e Here and below Marx erroneously wrote 'Lausanne'.

Marx to Paul Lafargue.
19 April 1870 International Association which was to have General Congresses of its own, which was to form an independent international body, and, at the same time, to be an integral member of our Internationale.
In one word, our Association was by this interlop­ ing secret society by and by to be converted into an instrument du Russe'' Bakounine.
The pretext was, that this new society was founded for the special purpose 'à faire la propagande théoretique'.
h Very funny indeed, considering that Bakunine and his acolytes know nothing of theory.
But Bakunine's programme was 'the theory'.
It consisted, in fact, of 3 points.
1) That the first requirement of the social Revolution was—the abolition of inheritance, vieillerie St Simoniste , 624 dont le charlatan et l'ignoramus Bakunine se faisait l'éditeur responsable .
c It is evident: If you have had the power to make the social Revolution in one day, par décret plébiscitaire? you would abolish at once landed property and capital, and would therefore have no occasion at all to occupy yourselves with le droit d'héritage? On the other hand, if you have not that power (and it is of course foolish to suppose such a power), the proclamation of the abolition of inheritance would be not a serious act, but a foolish menace, rallying the whole peasantry and the whole small middle-class round the reaction.
Suppose f.
i.
that the Yankees had not had the power to abolish slavery by the sword.
What an imbecility it would have been to proclaim the abolition of inheritance in slaves] The whole thing rests on a superannuated idealism, which considers the actual jurispru­ dence as the basis of our economical state, instead of seeing that our economical state is the basis and source of our jurisprudence! As to Bakounine, all he wanted was to improvise a programme of his own making.
Voilà tout.
C'était un programme d'occasion* 2) L 'êgalité des différentes classes.
8 To suppose on the one hand the continued existence of classes, and on the other hand the égalité of the members belonging to them, this blunder shows you at once the shameless ignorance and superficiality of that fellow who made it his 'special mission' to enlighten us on 'theory'.
3) The working class must not occupy itself with politics.
They must only organise themselves by trades-unions.
One fine day, by means of the Internationale they will supplant the place of all existing states.
You see what a caricature he has made of my doctrines! As the transformation of the existing States into a of the Russian -b to carry on theoretical propaganda -c old St Simonist rubbish, of which Bakunin, a charlatan and ignoramus, was the responsible publisher -d by plebiscite -e right of inheritance -f That's all.
This was a makeshift programme.
-g Equality of different classes.
321.
Marx to Paul Lafargue.
19 April 1870 491 Associations is our last end, we must allow the governments, these great trade-unions of the ruling classes, to do as they like, because to occupy ourselves with them is to acknowledge them.
Why! In the same way the old socialists said: You must not occupy yourselves with the wages question, because you want to abolish wages labour, and to struggle with the capitalist about the rate of wages is to acknowledge the wages system! The ass has not even seen that every class movement as a class movement, is necessarily and was always a political movement.
This then is the whole theoretical baggage of Mahomet-Bakunine, a Mahomet without a Koran.
His conspiracy he went secretly on with.
He had some affiliates in Spain and Italy, a few dupes at Paris and Geneva.
Good old Becker was foolish enough to allow himself to be put forward somewhat in a leading character by Bakunine.
He regrets his blunder at present.
The General Council was only informed and called upon to sanction the statutes of the 'Alliance' after Bakounine considered that concern as fait accompli.
However he was mistaken.
In an elaborate document the General Council declared the 'Alliance' to be an instrument of disorganisation, and rejected every connexion with it.
(I shall send you the document.
)3 A few months later, the Comité Directeur of the 'Alliance' addressed a letter to the General Council to the effect: The great men were willing to dissolve their organisation and merge it into the Internationale, but on the other hand, we were to declare categorically, Oui ou Non!, b whether we sanctioned their prin­ ciples? If not, there would be a public secession on their part, and we would be responsible for such a misfortune c! We answered that the General Council was not the Pope, that we allowed every section to have its own theoretical views of the real movement, always supposed that nothing directly opposite to our Rules was put forward.
We hinted in a delicate way that we considered their 'theory' to be a sham.
We insisted that 'l'égalité des classes' d be changed for 'l'abolition des classes','' what they did.
301 We requested them to give us the dénombrement 1 of their members, what they have never complied with.

19 April 1870 Thus the Alliance was nominally dissolved.
In fact, it continued to form an Imperium in imperia Its branches had no connexion at all with the General Council, but that of conspiring against it.
It acted under Bakunine's dictatorship.
He prepared everything to frapper son grand coup au Congrès de Bale.
" On the one side, he made the Geneva Committee b propose la question d'héritage.
We accepted the challenge.
625 On the other side, he conspired everywhere to discredit us and to have the seat of the General Council transferred from London to Geneva.
At that congress, ce saltimbanque figurait comme 'délégué de Naples et de Lyon' c (at that latter place, Albert Richard, otherwise a very active and well-meaning youngster, is his acolyte).
Where the fellow got the money for all his secret machinations, travels, missions of agents etc.
remains to this moment a secret.
Poor like a church mouse, he has never in his life earned a farthing by his own work.
At the Congress he was baffled.
After the Congress he commenced to attack us publicly by his private moniteur, Le Progrès (de Locle), edited by his valet James Guillaume, a Swiss schoolmaster, and by the Égalité (de Genève).
507 We allowed this to go on for some time, and then sent a missive to the Federal Council of Geneva.
(This document—copy of it—is in the hands of Varlin.
) But before our circular arrived, the Federal Council of Geneva, never friendly to Bakunine and the Alliance, had broken loose from him.
Robin et Co.
were expulsed from the Editorship of the Egalité.
The Federal Council of the Swiss Romand Section made his pronunciamento against the intrigues of the Alliance and its Muscovite dictator.
Meanwhile Bakounine had left Geneva to reside at Tessin.
His circumstances were changed.
Herzen died suddenly.
Bakounine, who had attacked him fiercely during the latter times (probably because he found Herzen's purse shut against him), all at once became the fiery apologist of Herzen in the French etc.
press.
586 Why? Because Herzen (although a millionaire) received annually for his Cloche and 'propagande Russe' a rather large sum from the Panslavistes démocrates in Russia.
587 Although a fierce enemy de l'héritage Bakounine wanted to inherit Herzen's position and salary.
He succeeded by his panegyrics of the dead man.
He had the Cloche, the subvention etc.
transferred to himself.
626 On the other hand there had grown up at Geneva a colony of Russian émigrés, 541 enemies of Bakunine, because they knew the a to deal a decisive blow at the Basle Congress -b the Federal Committee of Romance Switzerland -c this charlatan acted as the 'delegate of Naples and Lyons' 321.
Marx to Paul Lafargue.
19 April 1870 493 mere personal ambition of this very mediocre man (although an accomplished intriguer) and because they knew that in his 'Russian' writings he propagates doctrines quite contrary to the principles of the Internationale.
The late Swiss Romand Congress at La Chaux de Fonds (5 April this year) was seized upon by Bakunine and his moutons 3 to bring about an open split.
606 The Congress was split into two Congresses, on the one hand a Congress of Bakunites, proclaiming abstention from all politics, representing about 600 men; on the other hand the Congress of the Federal Comité of Geneva, representing 2,000 men.
Outine (c'est un des jeunes Russes) dénonça publiquement les intrigues de Bakounine.
h His men have constituted themselves as a 'Federal Central Council' pour la Suisse Romande," and have founded their own organ La Solidarité, edited by Bakounine's valet de chambre, James Guillaume.
The 'principle' of that paper is 'Bakounine'.
Both parties have appealed to the General Council.
Thus this damned Muscovite has succeeded to call forth a great public scandal within our ranks, to make his personality a watchword, to infect our Working Men's Association with the poison of sectarianism, and to paralyse our action by secret intrigue.
He hopes to be strongly represented at our next Congress.
To direct to himself the attention of Paris, he has opened a correspondence with the Marseillaise.
But we have spoken with Flourens, who will put a stop to this.
You are now sufficiently informed to counteract Bakounine's movements within our Paris branches.

The Genevans are, at all events, rather sluggish, otherwise they would not have got into this unfortunate position with the Bakuninists formally having the rules on their side with regard to them.
This does not, of course, alter the fact that the Genevans must remain in the right; but, for the time being, the General Council has no reason to intervene, since the Genevans have appealed for a ballot in the sections, and you will have to wait for the result of this, one way or the other, before making a decision.
The Bakuninists will probably not let themselves in for this referendum, since their règlement fédéral 3 probably makes no mention of it, and they will, thereby, expose their weak point in wishing to sacrifice the unity of the International, and the International itself into the bargain, to their empty formalism.
Then there would be reason enough to intervene.
On the other hand, the Genevans themselves must see to it this time that they gain the majority in their plebiscite.
Till then, the General Council could, at the most, suspend both central committees, and replace them by a neutral provisional one (Becker,b etc.
).
In the matter itself it is clear that the Alliance, even if tolerated by the General Council, has no place in a local organisation like the Suisse Romande, c since it wishes to correspond with all countries and maintain sub-sections there.
Thus it should either stay out of it, or abandon its international character.
Whereas, if the business in Switzerland continues to develop, the result will be either that it leaves the International completely, or can be thrown out.
But it must be impressed on the Messrs Genevans that they cannot be helped unless they help themselves.
If Bakunin were to get a majority of the workers of the Suisse Romande on his side, what could the General Council do? The only conceivable point is that of the total abstinence from all politics, but even this action would not be so certain.

4, Stuttgart, 1913 Published in English for the first time 323 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 28 April 1870 DEAR FRED, I visited Schapper again yesterday.
I FEAR HE IS FAST SINKING.
He himself spoke of his death as settled, even told me he had instructed his wife to have him buried next Sunday.
It is consumption of the lungs.
Schapper spoke and acted really d'une manière distinguée.
* As long as his wife and eldest son were in the room he conducted the conversation (he can only speak with difficulty) in French.
Je ferai bientôt la dernière grimace.
b He poked fun at old Oborski, who in the past few months has become a Catholic and says his prayers; ditto at Ruge, who once again believes in the immortality of the soul.
In this case, he said, Schapper's soul would play rough with Ruge's soul in the hereafter.
It gives him pleasure to make jokes about the old stories, meetings with Louis Bonaparte, Dr Conneau, Persigny, General Cavaignac etc.
, later Willich, etc.
It comforts him that his daughter is married, his eldest son Karl is independent (a bookbinder), and each of the two younger ones already earning £1 PER WEEK (as goldsmiths).
He hopes his brother (Nassau) will take in his youngest.
He has left all his scant possessions to his wife, and she will live with the two younger boys.
'Tell all our people that I have remained true to our principles.
I am no theoretician.
During the period of reaction I had my hands full bringing up my * in a very composed manner -b I shall soon pull my last face.

I have lived as a HARD WORKING worker, and die a proletarian.
' I gave him your greetings, and said that, had you believed the business was dangerous, you would have come up to see him.
This obviously pleased him.
Schapper is 57 years old.
The true manliness of his character emerged once again clearly and strikingly.
Leaving Schapper, I had to make a second sick-bed visit.
Borkheim wrote me a few lines the day before yesterday, that he had been at home sick the whole week, would probably have to stay in bed another week, then to the country, etc.
From the way his wife received me, I saw immediately that the matter was sérieux He had had typhoid fever; seems now on the road to improvement.
His lungs have certainly been affected.
The English doctor—one of the hospital doctors here—predicted all this, and repeats now that he hopes, and is virtually sure, that he will get away with it this time, but that if Borkheim does not abandon his mad life, he has not as much as a year before him.
The fact is that Borkheim studies Russian etc.
, with frenzy from 4.
30 or 5 in the morning until 9, then again from 7 in the evening until 11.
You know he writes polemical letters to everybody under the sun and, since he came into possession of a considerable library, has wished to make himself a scholar by brute force.
The doctor demands that he should chuck up everything except business for at least two years, and devote his leisure to light reading and other relaxations.
Otherwise he is lost, and this inevitably.
He has not the physical strength to do the work of two people.
I saw him for ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
He looked damnably fatigué and thin.
I told him that, as long as you were tied to business, you had engaged yourself only VERY MODERATELY in other things.
I did this on purpose, since I know he respects you very much.
When I came downstairs to his wife in the PARLOUR I recounted the conversation to her.
She said—and I promised to do what I could to this end—that you would do her the greatest favour by writing to her husband.
First of all, it would cheer him up greatly—such a sign of attention on your part—and second, he .
would take it to heart if you advised him not to ruin himself by EXTRA WORK.
It is my FEELING that Borkheim is, at the moment, hors de danger," but he must watch out like the devil.
Apropos.
He is very annoyed with Liebknecht, for first printing the Bakunin letter 629 and then writing to him (Borkheim) that he (Borkheim) must now answer.

28 April 1870 497 Good old Wilhelm, always READY to make BLUNDERS so that others must work! C'est un imbécile* Flourens has already visited me at home several times.
He is a very nice fellow.
His predominant characteristic is AUDACITY.
But he is very well educated in the natural sciences.
For a year he gave lectures on ethnology630 at Paris University, and was all over the place in Southern Europe, Turkey, ASIA MINOR, etc.
Full of illusions and revolutionary impatience, BUT A VERY JOLLY FELLOW WITH ALL THAT, not one of the 'damned serious' school of men.
His name has been proposed for our COUNCIL, where he has twice assisted as a guest.
It would be a very good thing if he were to stay here longer.
It is WORTH WHILE working on him.
If, however, Bonaparte grants an amnesty after the plebiscite, he will return to Paris.
Yesterday evening, he and Tibaldi were given a banquet by the FRENCH Freemasons' lodge, the FRENCH BRANCH,72 etc.
L.
Blanc, Talandier, etc.
, also wanted tob take part.
All the French revolutionary riff-raff here are courting him, but he is already PRETTY WELL informed about these gentry.
My best thanks for your explanation about the IRISH BOG.
C For fun I got hold of the RETURN on GAME LAWS CONVICTIONS (ENGLAND AND WALES) for 1869.
Total number of CONVICTIONS: 10,345.
These are thus the specific AGRARIAN CRIMES of the English and Welsh.
Why does not Mr Gladstone also suspend the constitution in England? You were right to smell a rat in Pigott's letter.
From the enclosed Flag of Ireland (LETTER of the Paris correspondent of The Irishman in it) one can see the fellow Pigott's mauvaise foid—since he knows we take The Irishman here—has the muck printed in the Flag.

h33 Here, in England, in front of my very eyes, so many attempts to found workers' movements and organisations have failed because of bad treasurer's work and book-keeping, and the resultant recurrent justified and unjustified charges of embezzle­ ment and so on, that in this case I can consider myself competent to deliver judgement on the importance of this point.
The workers have to deprive themselves for every farthing, so have the fullest right to know where every farthing goes, as long as they do not need and are not putting aside secret funds.
And I believe that this is of special importance, particularly in Germany, since there, too, exploitation of the workers by knavish agitators has become the fashion.
It is a hollow pretext to say that, by publishing such financial statements, you betray the weakness of your own party to the enemy.
If the enemy wishes to judge the strength of a workers' party according to its specifically weak side — the state of its funds — it will, in any case, be out in its reckoning.
And the damage done in one's own ranks by keeping such things secret is far greater than that which can arise from publication.

29 April 1870 499 Bonhorst bewails the apathy of the workers 634—but I find that things are going unexpectedly swimmingly in Germany.
The individual successes naturally entail a hard struggle, and those involved naturally think things are going too slowly.
But compare 1860 and 1870, and compare the present state of affairs in Germany with that in France and England — and recall the head start that these two countries had over us! The German workers have got half a dozen of their people into parliament; the French and the English not a single one Allow me to remark, in this connection, that all of us here regard it as of the greatest importance that as many worker candidates stand as possible in the coming elections, and that as many are elected as possible.

b If that is not correct, be so good as to notify him.
I would, in fact, have been glad to come over to see Schapper, and would still do so, had not your letter led me to assume he was already dead.

If, as the result of the pleurisy, he has contracted consumption, then there is nothing to be done, and it will happen very quickly.
Bakunin's letter is really very naïve.

29 April 1870 peasantry behind them, and with any career ahead of them except the dilemma: Siberia, or emigration to Western Europe.
If there were anything that could ruin the West European movement, it would be the importation of these 40,000±a educated, ambitious, hungry Russian nihilists; all of them officer cadets without an army, which we should provide them; a marvellous piece of impertinence that, in order to bring unity to the European proletariat, it must be commanded in Russian! Yet however greatly Bakunin exaggerates, it is as clear as day that the danger exists.
CattTafi Pycbb will spit out a certain number of these 'careerless' Russians every year, and, with the excuse of the principe international, they will creep in everywhere amongst the workers, swindle their way into leading roles, carry their private intrigues and brawls—unavoidable amongst the Russians—into the sections, and then the GENERAL COUNCIL will have its work cut out.
It has already struck me that Utine has already found a way to obtain a position with the Genevans.
And these Russians moan that, back at home, all positions are occupied by Germans! I have had it out in all friendship with Wilhelm on various points, both about his previous attitude and also about his present attitude in the Reichstag.
Bonhorst was arrested in Eschweiler because he lacked legitimation papers, after the Reichstag had passed the Passport Abolition Law, yet Monsieur Liebknecht misses the chance to interpellate the government about flagrant illegality and to force it to confess that such laws are in no way intended to apply to workers.
And the jackasses expect the workers to re-elect them.
Incidentally, I have also written to Bracke, who approached me for money for the 'Party', saying how necessary it is that they should nominate worker candidates and force them through everywhere/ Wilhelm is capable of saying that this is not necessary at all.
The Spanish papers and the Flagd—received with thanks.
When I travelled past Majorca in 1849 I would not have dreamed that, in 20 years, we would have a papere there.
At the time that hole was regarded as a Corsican wilderness.
Pigott remains the same ambiguous figure.
In Ireland they must have a 'Republic', but the French should remain under Bonaparte.

29 April 1870 501 The ancient laws of Ireland,3 through which I am at present rummaging, are a bitter mouthful.
First, the text itself is not very clear, since it assumes a knowledge of all ancient Irish law, which no longer exists.
2.
It is very garbled.
3.
The translation is bad, and in places definitely wrong, but it is clear that the agrarian conditions were not quite as simple as good old Daviesh—with interest — described them.
The laws insofar as published, give only the complicated side, not the simple one.
Incidentally, I am not yet through with the stuff; from time to time I am forced to refer to the Celtic text, too, and since I don't even have a grammar, I don't get along very fast.
But so much is clear: the editors, for all their knowledge of Celtic, don't understand the contents any more than I do.
These things have been published at state cost by the COMMISSIONERS FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE ANCIENT LAWS AND INSTITUTES OF IRELAND.
636 It is obviously a gruelling job.
In which PARLIAMENTARY PAPER can one find out how much these fellows cost annually? They have been in session since 1852, do nothing except engage WORKING UNDERSTRAPPERS, and these two volumes are all that has appeared so far.

7 May 1870-328 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTERS« [London,] 7 May 1870 DEAR FRED, All sorts of interesting things have happened here this week.
But the English post is too INQUISITIVE at the moment, and I don't feel the call to SUPPLY it indirectly with news.
So, about this, later by word of mouth.
639 The Marseillaise did not arrive today.
Possibly it has been confiscated.
Last Wednesday" we informed them by telegraph that they would receive the General Council resolutionb on Thursday in the original French; they should not translate it from English.
This telegram naturally came immediately to the attention of the Paris police, and Pietri does not, perhaps, want our proclamation one day before the plebiscite.
The absurd Reuter-Havas telegrams have finally given us the long-awaited opportunity to declare publicly in the Paris press that the SO-CALLED LONDON FRENCH BRANCH does not belong to the International.
640 Yesterday and the day before The Standard published two lousy articles against the International, dictated directly from the French Legation, as, ditto, the article in the London French paper L'International.
All London papers have received instructions from Bruce—and naturally obey them like the born dogs they are—not to mention a word in their columns about the steps the English police have taken very quietly in past weeks with regard to Flourens and the International GENERAL COUNCIL (they make a HODGE PODGE out of the two).
Ten thousand COPIES of The Standard mentioned have been sent to France.
Is this, also, a method of payment, or has the Société du 10 Décembre 641 suddenly learned English? Last Tuesday the rumour was spread in London that we were going to be arrested in our meeting room.
As a result PRESS REPORTERS, for once hungry for news, were in attendance.

7 May 1870 505 In England, at a moment of panic the fellows immediately forget their own laws, and allow themselves to be carried away by the press, which is partly ignorant, and partly lies with intent.
To be nice to the police, let us assume that everything reported by Grandperret, Reuter and the Journal officiel is gospel truth.
Even so, the English Government could do nothing, apart, at the most, from making fools of themselves.
There can, d'abord, 2 be no question of the extradition of Flourens— Gaulois says it has been demanded.
642 There is only one Extradition Treaty between France and the UNITED KINGDOM, that of 1843.
In 1865 the French Government declared it would denounce it after 6 months, since it was practically unworkable because of the ENGLISH LAWS OF EVIDENCE.
AS a result, in 1866 some of the formalities regarding EVIDENCE were changed, without any change in the content of the treaty.
This specifies very precisely the crimes that lead to extradition, including murder (PARRICIDE, INFANTICIDE, and murder by poison) and attempted murder, notabene, attempts in the sense qu'il y avait un commencement d'exécution^ 'THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE THE DEATH OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE LIFE WAS ATTACKED'.
Under this treaty Beaury, for instance, could not be extradited had he fled to England, let alone Flourens.
The only question is whether a FOREIGNER here could be sentenced by an English court for COMPLICITY IN A CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT THE CRIME OF MURDER ABROAD.
Before 1828 nobody—Englishman or FOREIGNER—could be prose­ cuted here for MURDER COMMITTED OUT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.
English duellists made use of this.

M.
S "SUBJECTS" SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH MURDER OR WITH ANY ACCESSORY TO MURDER COMMITTED ON LAND OUT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HE SHOULD BE TRIABLE FOR SUCH OFFENCES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM'.
The law was, in fact, made to fit English duellists, and therefore applies only to 'HER MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS'.
At Dr Bernard's TRIAL' in 1858 he therefore pleaded 'THAT THE COURT HAD NO JURISDICTION'.
The SERVILE COURT reserved this point, without taking a decision, and ruled that, for a start, A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY SHOULD BE RECORDED.
His ACQUITTAL prevented any further decision on this LEGAL POINT.
Immediately after the Orsini PLOT of 1858, Palmerston intro­ duced the CONSPIRACY BILL into the HOUSE OF COMMONS, a for the time -b in which a deed was commenced 1^-983 506 328.

7 May 1870 'WITH THE OBJECT OF MAKING CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER EITHER WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM OR WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF ANY FOREIGN STATE A FELONY".
This BILL was justified by the following in 1.
'CONSPIRACY WAS ONLY A MISDEMEANOUR' and that, under English LAW, a CONSPIRACY TO MURDER is nothing more nor less than A CONSPIRACY TO BLACKEN A MAN'S CHARACTER.
2.
And this was shown very emphatically by the ATTORNEY GENERAL Sir R.
Bethell— 'THAT THE 9 GEO.

The CONSPIRACY BILL, as everyone knows, was rejected, and Lord Palmerston fell FOR THE TIME BEING, together with the bill.
The whole commotion in the English and French press is, therefore, complete nonsense.

Gladstone will tempt the devil where Palmerston failed.
If this PLOT—for the ASSASSINATION of Badinguet3—is not simply a police invention, then it is the biggest possible bit of tomfoolery open to man.
Luckily, the EMPIRE can no longer be saved even by the stupidity of its enemies.
Bakunin's agent Robin, now in Paris and a member of the Paris Federation (Internationale),644 immediately proposed a resolution there recognising the new Conseil Romand as the genuine one, and making a public announcement in the Marseillaise that only its supporters are really MEMBERS of the Internationale.
But we had advised our people in Paris.
b Robin thus failed gloriously with his resolution.
It was decided that the Federation Parisienne had absolutely no autorité to intervene; the matter was something for the Conseil Général in London.
This business is, however, characteristic of the modus operandi of Gospodin c Bakunin.
The Paris PLOT brings to a sorry end the well-advanced plan to hold the Congress in Paris, and to take this opportunity also to transfer the General Council there.
I have received from Bakunin the 5 first Nos.

This dunderhead, who has been jogging around helplessly for years on the ridiculous contradiction between right and might, like an infantry man placed upon a horse with the staggers and locked in the riding-school—this ignoramus has the insolence to wish to dispatch a man like Hegel with the word 'Preuss' b and, at the same time, suggests to the public that J had said it.
I have now had enough of the whole thing.

10 May 1870 511 331 MARX TO ENGELS 56 IN MANCHESTERS« [London,] 10 May 1870 DEAR FRED, Yesterday I received the enclosed screed from Wilhelm.
3 An incorrigible South German bumpkin.
You will see from it, d'abord, that the blockhead never wrote to Meissner b and attended to all my commissions in the same way.
And, for precisely this reason, I should now write to him 'regularly', and you should go to 'Stuttgart', in the same way as he wished to propose you as a MEMBER of the North German Reichstag 648! I had written to him649 that if, when he wrote about Hegel, he knew nothing better than to repeat the old Rotteck-Welcker muck, then he would do better to keep his mouth shut.
c He says that this would be 'making rather informally short work, etc' of Hegel, and when he writes stupidities beneath Engels' articles, then 'Engels can of course (!) say something at greater length (!!)'.
The fellow really is too stupid.
The circular,0 which reached him in such a 'romantic' manner, states that the General Council reserves the right to speak about Schweitzer, etc.
, 'publicly' as soon as it considers suitable.
This Wilhelm converts into us wanting to make a 'public declaration'— for Wilhelm! With regard to the next congress, what do you think of Bebel's suggestion about Mainz or Mannheim650 ? Better Mainz.
The business would be a good thing, insofar as Mr Bakunin et Co.
would be totally powerless in Germany.
Shameless Wilhelm, who thought my Bonaparte' scarcely worth a note in his sheet/ demands my permission to publish my articles on the French Revolution 8!

10 May 1870 original of our declaration, 3 written by me, was certainly written in Parisl Incidentally, I am pleased that this sheet is finally abandoning the patronage it has hitherto granted us, which we found very distasteful.
The ancient Irish business with women quite pales compared to what the Celts in WALES allowed themselves in that field.
This was (up until the 11th-12th century) quite Fourier's fantasy mise en pratique^ For my birthday, Kugelmann sent me two pieces of wallpaper from Leibniz's study, which amused me very much.
It appears Leibniz's home was pulled down last winter, and the stupid Hanoverians—who could have made good business in London with the relics—threw everything away.
Each of these two pieces depicts something mythological, one Neptune in his waves, etc.
, the other Venus, Amor, etc.
, all in poor Louis XIV style.
On the other hand the quality (solidity) of the hand manufactory of those days compares well with today's.
I have hung the two pieces up in my study.
You KNOW MY ADMIRATION FOR Leibniz.
I am still suffering so much from the nose stoppage resulting from my last visit to Borkheim that my daughters have forbidden me to go to the GENERAL COUNCIL this evening, and threaten, if I disobey, to send to FRED Engels A SAVAGE DENUNCIATION OF MY CONDUCT.
My presence there is really very necessary just now.
Enfin, nous verrons !c Apropos.
I recently purchased a 14-volume edition of Swift (of 1760) for all of 4'/2 shillings.
So, as soon as you need to look at Swift's things about Irish subjects, the necessary will be sent to you.

Holding the congress in Germany would present some difficul­ ties, since one simply does not know what laws rule there, though one does know which police practices prevail.
But it is fairly certain that a dissolution of the congress by the police would be the worst to be expected; the people would be safe, with the exception of a possible 24-hour detention; but it would have to be determined now where the congress should reassemble if dis­ solved— in Belgium or Switzerland.
Otherwise, Mainz would be quite a good place, and Mannheim, too; the Baden Government is so harassed by the People's Party38 and the ultramontanists that it would scarcely take any action.
Since Wilhelm mucked about my Peasant War in such a manner, 647 think what he will do with your articles3! Could you get together for me that material for a note, with citation of the sources, on the Welsh phanerogamic being6? I could use it just now, in a few days I shall be writing about this.
The bourgeois vandalism with regard to Leibniz's house is very common.
In any case, I congratulate you on the relics.
I shall hardly likely be needing Swift before I move to London.

11 May 1870 Republicans urged the army about non, this would only have been useful if immediate action had been intended, but it is agreed that this was not the case.
As things have now turned out, the soldiers will have to suffer, and 'more reliable' regiments will be sent to Paris.
612 If you and your family wish to reconnoitre the surrounding dis­ trict for a house for me, this would be very agreeable for us he­ re.
I have my house here until the end of September, so if I move at the end of August there is time enough.
In addition, I have enough material to made through here, and it's easier here than in London.
You know the sort of house I need: at least 4, if possible 5 bedrooms (since Pumps3 is growing up), and apart from a study for me, two living rooms and kitchen, etc.
If possible without a close dominant vis-à-vis.
It would be desirable that it should not be much higher up than you live, since Lizzie has an asthmatic reluctance about hill climbing.
If you find something, then I can come over.
It doesn't need to be as big as your house, and smaller rooms would suffice for me.

626 In the first numbers Bakunin has only one letter,0 in which he acts like a stranger, attacks the editors for lack of principles, etc.
, puts on airs as a socialist and internationalist, etc.
Yet, WITH ALL THAT, what his letter amounts to is that, in theory, all coalitions are to be condemned, but in practice, to be sure, Ogarev is right.
The main thing now is to overthrow Tsarism, and for this the unification of all parties hostile to it is necessary, etc.

15 May 1870 517 334 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 15 May 1870 Dear Moor, Mainz is not so bad, the Hessian Government is always at loggerheads with the Prussian Governor, and the Prussians have to declare a state of siege in the city before they can do anything.
Darmstadt has too small a proletariat and, in addition, a small court, so one cannot count on anything.
Mannheim, also, has a smaller proletariat than Mainz, and altogether I think it would be good to hold the congress under the noses of the Prussian soldiers.
If it is broken up, then the whole show can move to Brussels; even those compromised in Prussia can get there via Strasbourg, Metz and Luxembourg in 24 hours; the others via Cologne or Saarbrücken-Luxembourg.
Apropos, the International should try to obtain a footing in Luxembourg; there are many miners, tanners, etc.
, there.
This must be done from Saarbrücken or Aachen; the committee 3 should be charged with this.
Best thanks for the Celtica.
b I shall take a few hours to look up further details in the Chetham LIBRARY, where I shall probably find something.
Ogygia is a horribly uncritical thing; here and there there are notes of some value, since the fellow had at his disposal old writings now lost, but in order to discover this you would have to plough through Irish Codices for at least 3 years.
Dr Ch.
O'Conor's Scriptores are ± c good sources, but mainly later ones; but he also published the Annals of Ulster with a Latin translation and, ditto, the first volume of the Annals of the 4 Masters, and I don't know whether this is included there.
But the Annals of the 4 Masters, the main work, was edited and translated by Dr O'Donovan in 1856, and I have it here; I went through the first volume yesterday.
662 Ware (Sir Jam.
Ware, I think judge or something of the sort under Charles I) is by far the best of the older ones; he also had available to him, in translation, old writings now lost; he wrote in Latin (Waraeus), I have him in English and Latin.

515-16 -c more or less The continuous reading of Irish books, i.
e.
, the parallel English translation, could not be stood without at least a superficial knowledge of the phonetic and inflexional laws of the language.
I have discovered here a frightful Irish grammar from Anno I773, a and ploughed through it the day before yesterday, thereby learning something, but the man himself had no idea of the real laws of Irish.
The only good grammar is that by Dr John O'Donovan, mentioned above, the best Irologist of this century.
When you go to the Museum b you should take it out in order to see what it would cost approximately (O'Donovan has the habit of publishing nothing except fat expensive quarto volumes): O'Dono-van's Irish Grammar.
In addition you might also look at: Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of Hy-Fiachrak, PRINTED FOR THE IRISH ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY 1844 (presumably by O'Donovan), and Tribes and Customs of Hy-Many (ditto), to find out whether there is anything in them about social conditions, and whether these are fat expensive books: if not, and there is something in them, I shall acquire them.
There exists, further, an edition (by O'Donovan) of Leabhar nag-Ceart (BOOK OF RIGHTS), and if you could find an opportunity to take a look at it and tell me whether there is any prospect of results in it—NB.
only for social conditions, everything else is of no interest to me—and whether it is an expensive de luxe edition, I would be very much obliged.
On the basis of the quotations I have, there is not much in it for my purpose.
But this, I think, fairly well exhausts the relevant old literature, insofar as it has been published.
Ogarev was already an editor of Kolokol with Herzen, and is quite an ordinary bourgeois and poet.
If Bakunin should really receive the money, and not Ogarev, then Ogarev will certainly be fettered to him as a controller.
In the last few days I have often been sitting at the quadrilateral desk in the small bow-window where we sat 24 years ago; I like this place very much; because of its coloured window the weather is always fine there.

4, Berlin, 1931 t,me 335 MARX TO ENGELS 180 IN MANCHESTER [London,] 16 MAY 1870654 Dear FRED, Enclosed—a very well-behaved screed from Wilhelm 655! The old fool is beginning to take fright.
In my last letter,649 I told him that Borkheim was very sick; the Dr had forbidden him to do literary work for a long time even after his recovery; the continuation of Bakunin's twaddle, 629 which should never have been started, must now be stopped, etc.
! And what does the brute do? In the issue of Volksstaat that arrived today he published a personally defamatory article against Borkheim, written by the vagabond Nechayev.
656 I am really afraid this will excite Borkheim in a dangerous manner.
Borkheim wrote to me the day before yesterday; he wanted to see me.
I could not go because of my very foul cold and cough.
But my wife was there yesterday.
He is still very weak, and all excitement has specifically been prohibited by the Dr! The arrival of Volksstaat today will have caused an awful scene! I wrote immediately to Wilhelm, the silly blockhead, and fittingly hauled him over the coals.
At the same time, I mentioned that his effusions about you were 'too childish' to be answered, but he could rely upon it that his (Wilhelm's) 'private views about Hegel or ANYTHING ELSE' were a matter of indifference to you, 3 ditto the circumstance 'which' and 'what assortment of studies' he (Wilhelm) 'rather despises'.
The fellow's claim that he has led 'for 22 years a restless life, with no time for any leisure' is delicious.
We know he spent ABOUT 15 years of the 22 in idleness.
I am sending you the Echo, which you must preserve, because of the disavowal of the FRENCH BRANCH^ also published in the Marseillaise, Internationale (Brussels), and our other organs.
Circumstances were finally so favourable that we had an opportunity to give an official kick to the rabble.
Mayence! soit!c It is un peu indiscret 0 for Bracke to have had extracts from your private letter to him e published in Volksstaat.
But the intention is good, and I even believe this operation was politically correct.
They obviously wished thereby to take a kick at Schweitzer.
There has already been a lot in The Irishman about the scurvy IRISH Laws COMMISSION.
636 I shall try to find out the necessary about it.
If my condition doesn't quickly change so that it no longer disturbs my work, I might come for 8-14 days to Manchester.
639 If nothing else helps, perhaps a change of air will.

17 May 1870 521 336 ENGELS TO MARX IN LONDON Manchester, 17 May 1870 Dear Moor, Liebknecht will hardly send you my letter, since it is just the opposite of what Wilhelm says it is.
I took special care not to use any insulting expression, but the whole letter naturally centres on the bitter FACT that Wilhelm writes under my signature on subjects about which he knows nothing (as now admitted).
And this must of course 'insult him'.
Even now it is incomprehensible how he could publish Nechayev's filthy letter,656 which consists of a series of curses, and nothing else but the very stupidest Russian Herzenite platitudes.
Something like this can only be explained by his enormous indolence, which makes him struggle as hard as he can to fill up his paper 3 without working himself.
To bring your 'condition' to an end, the best thing for you would be to come in the course of this week, and with Tussy.
A change of air has always been good for you, and we shall see to it that you get better exercise here than there.
Then, if things are bad, you can also consult Gumpert.
But bring Tussy with you.
Lizzie has already baked CURRANT BREAD against her arrival, and the whole house has been in jubilo since I announced I would ask you to bring her with you.
If you can come tomorrow, tant mieux h; just telegraph, no more notice is needed to have you rooms ready.
Otherwise on Thursday^ It will do both of us good to march through the fields, and to laugh about the assorted humbuggery that has been abroad since I was last in London.
657 Lizzie has promised to go to bed unhesitatingly with Tussy at 11 o'clock every night—SUNDAYS ALWAYS EXCEPTED—so that this point will make no trouble either.
And, finally, I feel that my 1857 Rüdesheimer is now just at the stage when it should be drunk, and for this I need your help.
Thus, either a telegram tomorrow and 'han selv'd—not with a Der Volksstaat -b all the better -c 19 May -d himself 522 337.

The enclosed muck from Heinzen discloses at the tail-end—the false story about my relationship with Lassalle —who is prompting Heineke, the doughty bondsman.
658 It is OLD Hatzfeldt, probably operating through Weber junior, who deliberates in New York.
Incidentally, Heineke is making a grievous mistake if he expects me to honour him with a word of rebuttal.
He has been working to this end for years—to no avail! Our French MEMBERS are demonstrating ad oculosc the French Government the difference between a political secret society and a genuine workers' association.

31 May 1870 Old Heinzen is really entertaining.
For twenty years and even longer the same old tune, but literally, it's really moving.
You only need to say: Communist, and up jumps Heinzen, like a frog in strychnine-tetanus leaps when you touch the table on which it is lying.
Old Hatzfeldt's hand is unmistakable here, and the thing was certainly made in America,658 since nobody in Germany knows Heinzen's tune, the one you must whistle to make OLD Heinzen dance.
The myths about Lassalle's attempted revolution, which we caused to fail in Cologne, are just too stupid.
The behaviour of the French workers is grand.
The people are now active again and are in their element; there they are masters.

I think not that we shall stay longer than to the beginning of next week.
My cold is not yet quite gone, but the general state of health has [been] wonderfully improved consequent upon the change of air.
I see Gumpert almost daily and his advice is the more valuable the less he gets paid for it.
Here things are going on pretty much in the old track.
Fred is quite jolly since he has got rid of 'den verfluchten* Commerce'.

Marx to His Daughter Jenny.
31 May 1870 525 illustrious Doppeljua who is so much up in the most recent Irish history and plays so prominent a part in it, will there find his archeological material ready cut.
Lange's bookb differs from an 'Irish stew' in that particular point that it is all sauce and no substance.
This muddled meddler evidently intends to fish out some compliments from me in return for his 'sweets', but he is woefully mistaken.
How much he has understood of the Capital is clearly shown by his discovery that my theory of 'value' has nothing whatever to do with the develop­ ments on the Arbeitstagc etc.
Our friend Gumpert settles more and more down into a liberal, town-talk speaking, commonplace sort of fellow.
What with his self-produced and with his 'inherited' family, this is hardly to be wondered at.
It is too much of a good thing.
Tussy looks very blooming and is quite merry.
She has happily found the live stock at Mornington Palace660 increased by a new supply of kittens and so forth.
She crossexamined Fred of course as to the 'threatening letters'; he considered it dangerous to allude to such a thing in letters conveyed by post and possibly falling under the eye of some Stieber.
The true Stieber, who, I see, is eagerly busying himself at Paris to hatch a new complot, in which the 'Intern.

' is to play the principal part and where I, as his old protégé, and 'wirklicher geheimer Oberhauptchef' d must of course put e in my appearance.
While I write these lines, damned Fred is bothering me by continual 'fragmentary' communications from the old Norse Sagas.
Apropos of Norse Sagas, has Möhmchen f not assisted at K.
Blind's poetical lecture Sunday last? Little Dakyns came over Saturday evening and stayed here on Sunday.
This his visit was paid to Tussy and myself.
This brave gnome was horselaughing all the time over.
His costume was faster than ever before—papierne Vatermörder ohne Kravatte, g a dirty white hat instead of the Scotch cap, and eine Sorte weisser Schuhe wie man sie at the seaside trägt.

27 June 1870 527 341 MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN 29 IN HANOVER London, 27 June 1870 Dear King Wenceslaus, 3 I returned here this week after a stay of one month in Manchester, and found your letter waiting.
662 In fact I can give you no reply as to the date of my departure, and not even to the question—which you have not asked — namely, whether I shall travel at all.
Last year I anticipated that, after the Easter Fair, I would have a second edition of my book,b and CONSEQUENTLY the takings from the first edition.
You will see, however, from the enclosed letter from Meissner,' which arrived today, that all this is still a long way off.
663 (Be so kind as to send me the letter back.
) Messieurs the German professors have recently found them­ selves obliged to take note of me now and then, even if in a very silly way; for example, A.
Wagner in a pamphlet on landed property, and Held (Bonn) in a pamphlet about the rural loan banks in the Rhine Province.
d Mr Lange (On the workers' question, etc.
, 2nd edition) e pays me great compliments, but with the object of increasing his own importance.
Mr Lange, you see, has made a great discovery.
All history may be subsumed in one single great natural law.
This natural law is the phrase (—the Darwinian expression becomes, in this application, just a phrase—) 'STRUGGLE FOR LIFE', and the content of this phrase is the Malthusian law of population, or RATHER over-population.
Thus, instead of analysing this 'STRUGGLE FOR LIFE' as it manifests itself historically in various specific forms of society, all that need be done is to transpose every given struggle into the phrase 'STRUGGLE FOR LIFE', and then this phrase into the Malthusian 'population fantasy'.
It must be admitted that this is a very rewarding method—for stilted, mock-scientific, highfaluting ig­ norance and intellectual laziness.

27 June 1870 And what this Lange has to say about the Hegelian method and my application of the same is simply childish.
First, he under­ stands rieri* about Hegel's method and, therefore, second, still less about my critical manner of applying it.
In one respect he reminds me of Moses Mendelssohn.
That prototype of a windbag once wrote to Lessing asking how he could possibly take 'that dead dog Spinoza' 664 au sérieuxb \ In the same way, Mr Lange expresses surprise that Engels, I, etc.
, take au sérieux the dead dog Hegel, after Büchner, Lange, Dr Dühring, Fechner, etc.
, had long agreed that they—POOR DEAR—had long since buried him.
Lange is naïve enough to say that I 'move with rare freedom' in empirical matter.
He has not the slightest idea that this 'free movement in matter' is nothing but a paraphrase for the method of dealing with matter—that is, the dialectical method.
My best thanks to Madame la comtesse c for her kind lines.
This really does one good at a time 'when more and more of the better ones are disappearing'.
But, sérieusement parlant, 0 I am always pleased when a few lines from your dear wife remind me of the happy times I spent in your circle.
Regarding Meissner's pressure for the second volume,41 I was not only held up by illness throughout the winter.
I found it necessary to mug up on my Russian, because, in dealing with the land question, it has become essential to study Russian land­ owning relationships from primary sources.
In addition, in connection with the Irish land question, the English Government has published a series of BLUE BOOKS (soon concluding) about the land relations IN ALL COUNTRIES.
Finally— entre nous —I would like the second edition of Vol.
I first.
It would simply be disturbing if this came in the middle of the ULTIMATE finalisation of Vol.

5 July 1870 529 342 MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London,] 5 July 1870 DEAR FRED, You must excuse the interruption in our correspondence since my return to London.
639 THERE WAS so MUCH INTERNATIONAL AND OTHER BUSINESS PRESSING UPON ME.
Dupont, whose one child (BABY) is, for the time being, staying with his brother-in-law, the second with Serraillier, the third with him 3—all small girls—has in the meantime received two OFFERS as sort of MANAGER or chief OVERLOOKER (in wind-music-instrument factories), one in Paris, the other in Manchester.
I advised against No.
I, since there he would not only soon be arrested, but also become completely absorbed IN QUARRELS with the various cliques.
I strongly advised, on the other hand, No.
II, despite his aversion to it.
He has, therefore, accepted the offer of J.
Higham, 131 Strangeways, Manchester (BRASS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS).
The difficulty is that he will have to take one child, No.
II, with him immediately, and will have the two others follow him in a few weeks, so he needs a little house in Manchester, and some sort of reliable female person to look after the children and for DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT.
His income for a start will be £3 WEEKLY.
Could LIZZY do something directly or indirectly on this matter? Dupont is politically a character, but privatim enormously weak.
D'abord b he can stand very little liquor without getting very EXCITED.
SECONDLY he is easily dominated and exploited by his company.
He will perhaps go to Manchester in the course of this week.
In any case, I shall write in advance about his day of arrival.
From the enclosed letter from Meissner 663 you will see how things are there.
I had a pressing letter from Kugelmann, who will be leaving for Karlsbad c on 12 August, and is waiting for my declaration before renting accommodation, to which I replied with Meissner's letter.
I reminded him that Meissner had spoken in his presence of certain prospects for a second edition, d and payment for the Easter Fair; and I added that, UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, I a See this volume, p.

5 July 1870 could not say either when I would go to Karlsbad, or whether I would go at all.
HENCE his enclosed letter.
I have not yet replied, since we are still awaiting an answer from Dublin concerning O'Donovan Rossa's photograph.
Lafargue had notified me that a young Russian, Lopatin, would bring a letter of introduction from him.
Lopatin called on Saturday3; I invited him for Sunday (he was with us from 10 O'CLOCK until 12 at night),665 and he returned on Monday to Brighton, where he is living.
He is still very young, was two years in the lock-up, after this 8 months fortress confinement in the Caucasus, from which he escaped.
He is the son of an impoverished nobleman, and had to earn his living at the University of St Petersburg by private tutoring.
Today is living very meagrely from translations for Russia.
Lives in Brighton, since there he can bathe in the sea 2-3 times a day, gratis, at a certain distance from the official bathing beach.
A very wide-awake critical brain, cheerful character, stoical, like a Russian peasant who simply accepts what he gets.
Weak point: Poland.
Here he talks just like an Englishman—SAY AN ENGLISH CHARTIST OF THE OLD SCHOOL—does about Ireland.
He told me the whole story about HeHaeBi> b (23 years) is an abominable lie.
HenaeB-b has never been in a Russian prison; the Russian Government never undertook an assassinat against him, etc.
The story is this.
HenaeB-b (one of Bakunin's few agents in Russia) belonged to a secret society.
Another young man, X, c rich and enthusiastic, supported this society with money via HenaeB-b.
ONE FINE MORNING X tells Henaeß-b that he will not give another kopeck, since he does not know what is being done with the money.
Whereupon, Mr HenaeB-b suggested to his secret society (perhaps because he could not account for the money) that X be murdered, since he might change his views at a future date, and could become a traitor.
He really did murder him.
He is thus sought by the government simply as a murderer vulgaris.
In Geneva, Lopatin d'abord took HenaeBT> personally to task (about his lies), and he excused himself with the sensational political usefulness for the so-called cause.
Lopatin then told the story to Bakunin, who told him that as a 'bon vieillard' 0 he had believed it all.
Bakunin then challenged Lopatin to repeat the story in the presence of HenaeBij.
Lopatin immediately went with Bakunin to HenaeB-b where the scene was repeated.

5 July 1870 531 remained silent.
All the time Lopatin was in Geneva, HeHaeBT.
remained very unobtrusive, no longer saying a word.
Scarcely had Lopatin left for Paris, and the whole buffoonery started again.
Shortly after this, Lopatin received an insulting letter from Bakunin about the affair.
He replied in even more insulting terms.
Result: Bakunin wrote a Pater-peccavi3 letter (in Lopatin's posses­ sion here), but— il est un bon vieillard crêdule h\ {En passant:11 Lopatin says that whole sentences written by Borkheim are completely unintelligible and make complete nonsense in Russian, not only grammatically wrong but 'nothing at all'! And that fool Borkheim has, in the meantime, as he told me before my meeting with Lopatin, sent his bungling work through our friend Eichhoff in Berlin to a German there—who is used by the Berlin police as a Russian interpreter—in order to obtain from him a certificate that he can write Russian.
The talent of our Gaudissart for unconscious comedy is really UNRIVALLED!) HepHMiueBCKiH,d I learned from Lopatin, was sentenced in 1864 to 8 years travaux forcés* in the Siberian mines; so he still has two years to slave.
The first court was decent enough to declare that there was absolutely nothing against him, and that the alleged intriguing, plotting secret letters were obvious FORGERIES (which they were).
But the Senate, on the Tsar's orders, most graciously reversed this verdict, and sent off to Siberia this cunning man who, as the judgement said 'was so clever that he cast his writing in a legally unexceptionable form, but nevertheless publicly dispensed poison therein'.
Voilà la justice russe.
1 Flerovsky is in a better situation.
He is only in administrative exile in a miserable little hole between Moscow and Petersburg! You suspected rightly that Flerovsky is a pseudonym.
But Lopatin says that the name, although not originally Russian, occurs quite frequently amongst Russian clerics (namely MONKS, who think it is the Russian translation of Fleury, and who are just as keen on sweet-scented names as are the German Jews).
Lopatin was originally a naturalist by professional training.
He has also been concerned in commercial business, and it would be a good thing if one could find something for him in this line.

6 July 1870 533 think that his brother-in-law or Serraillier would be able to accommodate the 3rd child, too, for 8-14 days; in this case it would be better for him to come here alone right away, then I could immediately go round with him and get a house and, in the meantime, we could make enquiries about a woman.
Since he will have to bring the children here, or have them brought by somebody, it makes no difference if there are 2 or 3 of them.
If this is agreed, write to me immediately, so that I can get him quarters near his workshop, LODGINGS for a week with board if he wants it—I assume he will only want a BEDROOM without the expense of a SITTING ROOM?—and when he will be coming.
On this I expect an immediate reply, so I know what I have to do.
But, as I said, to bring the child with him right away would be absolute nonsense; it would cost him much more money, and would be in his way everywhere during the first few days.
Where should a woman spring from all of a sudden, if he doesn't simply take the first one to offer? Quoad" Karlsbad, 6 I am, as I said, in favour of you going there this summer.
I can make £40 available to you for the journey.
The cure is absolutely essential for you, even if you cannot completely avoid Kugelmann and his fervent fire thereby.
C.
Roesgen was also there, I saw him yesterday; he said it is not expensive there, particularly since 'there is no opportunity to spend money' during the cure; the cure did a lot of good to his liver (which is in a fine state compared to yours), and he looks rather thinner but much healthier.
So make up your MIND; apart from Kugelmann you will certainly find other interesting liver patients there, and on your way back you will travel via Hamburg and put pressure on Meissner.
So take a quick decision and leap with eyes closed into the hot springs of Karlsbad, and the equally warm admiration of Kugelmann.
NB.
Because of possible passport difficulties on the Austrian frontier, it might be a good thing if you were to travel in the company of your personal physician.
Lopatin's stories about the other pyccKLH 4Î>Aa c are very interesting and it is very useful to know them.
That HeHaeB-b d should turn out to be just a common blackguard is quite desirable.

There will probably be no refuge from the Jewish wit to which she refers.
Apropos Dupont.
Lizzie has her eyes on somebody quite suitable for him if only we can get hold of her, but I fear we shall have no information on this before Sunday or Monday.
It is her cousin Anna Kane, a person who is not young, not pretty, but honest to the backbone.
Tussy knows her; but we shall scarcely discover before Friday where she is at the moment, and will probably not be able to see her before the end of this week or the beginning of next.
I found and looked through the old Welsh laws3 in the official RECORD COMMISSION edition.
There are quite jolly things in it.
If a man discovers, on his nuptial night, that his wife is not a virgin, but lies with her until the morning, then nothing of hers falls to him, sed si, postquam illam vitiatam deprehenderit, surrexerit ad pronubos, pene erecto, et testaretur eis se illam vitiatam invenisse, et non concubuerit cum ilia ad crastinum usque; ilia nihil ab eo in crastinum habebit.
Si mammae et crines et menses apparuerint, tunc lex pronuntiat neminem posse certe scire num virgo sit necne b and thus she must produce 7 compurgators, including her parents and brothers and sisters.
If she will not or cannot do this LET HER SHIFT BE CUT OFF AS HIGH AS HER HIP, AND LET A YEARLING STEER BE PUT IN HER HAND, HAVING HIS TAIL GREASED WITH TALLOW, AND IF SHE CAN HOLD HIM BY HIS TAIL, LET HER TAKE HIM IN LIEU OF HER SHARE OF THE argyVTeU (PARAPHERNALIA), AND IF SHE CANNOT HOLD HIM, LET HER BE WITHOUT ANYTHING.
Now we have 'To BE LET' in the window.
Haven't you found anything yet? What is the catalogue of the London LIBRARY like? This is very important for me, so that I know what I can leave unread here.
Best greetings to you all.

Dupont can also stay with me for the first few days, until we have got him fixed up to some extent, and it will be much better if I do this together with him, rather than alone, without having him along.
Lizzie says she has bedding enough, without that used by Mary Ellen during her scarlet fever, which I naturally would not like to have used yet.

8 July 1870 When I wrote to you yesterday morning I had no way of knowing this yet, but so that you might receive today other news in addition to yesterday's letter, I telegraphed you this morning: Dupont's LITTLE GIRL WELCOME TO STAY WITH US, DIRECT THEM BOTH TO MY HOME, ADVISE TIME OF ARRIVAL.
I hope you received this telegram before further consultations with Dupont.
You must persuade him that he should not hesitate to accept my offer (if it is necessary, i.

Rüge to Steinthal.
25 January 1869 2 ARNOLD RÜGE TO STEINTHAL 671 IN MANCHESTER Brighton, 25 January 1869 7 Park Crescent Dear Mr Steinthal, At the same time as this letter, I am sending you Marx on capital by book-post.
Many thanks! This book has given me constant food for thought, though I had to work on all sorts of other things at the same time.
It is an epoch-making work and throws a shining and often scorching light on the development of the social periods, with the declines, the birth-pains, and the frightful days of agony.
The proofs of surplus value through unpaid labour, of the expropriation of the workers who had worked for themselves, and of the coming expropriation of the expropriators, are classical.
On the latter, p.
745a: 'The capitalist mode of production and appropriation, hence capitalist property, is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labour of the proprietor.
The negation of this negation therefore again gives the producer individual property, but based on the acquisitions of the capitalist era: i.
e.
, on the co-operation of free labourers and their possession in common of the land and of the means of production produced by labour itself Marx is a man of broad erudition and with a brilliant dialectical talent.
His book is above the level of many people and newspaper writers; but it will quite certainly make its way, and exercise a powerful influence, despite its broad scope; yes, precisely because of this.
With regard to religion, the author states very accurately: 608: 'As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.
' And to liberate him, it by no means suffices to shine a light in the owl's eye; in fact, whenever he loses his master, like the Frenchman or the Spaniard, then he himself installs one over himself again.

I (1867), pp.

Since their first and last letter from Liège, we have completely lost track of them.
But I expect they will move in on you this week, probably after a bit of tacking hither and thither, 672 so I am sending for your joint reading today's Times and an older number of The Pall Mall Gazette.
There is a deathly silence in the press here about the Congress,0 apart from the quite confused twaddly article in Pall Mall, which I enclose.
Today The Times has broken the ice for the first time with a very favourable factual and concise article,*1 which will arouse great interest here, and particularly in France, because of the speech by the American delegate.
" I believe I can smell out our 'George', in various turns of phrase, expressions and 'Eccariads', if it is possible to ascribe so much tact to him.
673 A real arsenal of newspapers and letters has accumulated here in the meantime; and I really don't know whether they are worth the trouble and cost of sending overseas; their contents are mostly a The year is in Kugelmann's hand.

Jenny Marx to Kugelmann.
15 September 1869 now so antiquated.
Lessner wrote 3 very pleasant detailed letters about the Congress and Liebknecht 2 wishy-washy ones that would be better left unread.
674 Eccarius conveys the curious fact that an American told him that he had heard from Mr Slack, the correspondent of the New-York Tribune in London, that 'Bright had written to all London newspaper offices and requested them to publish no reports on our deliberations'.
This would provide some explanation for the silence of the press.
But if The Times publishes a few more reports, the other bell-wethers will follow, and then the success of the Congress will be assured.
In any case, it will have more success than that of the Eisenachers,373 the only effect of which seems to be to have helped 'our great master Ferdinand'3 to obtain, in addition to his official ' moniteur' ,b the Social-Demokrat, a semi-official one in the form of Liebknecht's sheet.
c Even in Basle they tried to push the wretched Schweitzer scandal into the foreground, so that one might have thought that the 'Internationals' had no other mission but to internationalise the principles of the 'Man of Iron'd without the strict organisation?76 I shall send some private letters of interest to Hanover immediately, as soon as I hear that our dear 'wanderers' have reached you.
Laura, with her husband and their delightful little chap,e have been with us here just 4 weeks to the day; now they are beginning to prepare for their return to Paris.
Unfortunately, mother and son are not as well as I might wish.
The sweet little lad is suffering from the break-through of his first teeth, with all the usual symptoms.
His friendly face has grown so narrow and small, and his shining little eyes stare out of his pale face twice as large and rich as usual.
He is a cheerful, gentle lad, and we shall sorely miss the little monkey.

It is a wonderfully good one— better than the original painting.
I was very glad to have it.
— It gave me much pleasure to hear that you feel better—may time gradually reconcile you to the great loss you have sustained.
Think— 'after life's fitful fever, she sleeps well—nothing can hurt her further'.
3 Is there no consolation in that thought? I have written a note to Mrs Menke.

Moor also has written her a few lines.
He is much better and has almost managed to get rid of the troublesome cough which so much tormented him at Hanover.
He sends you his kind regards, and hopes you will excuse his [not] writing to you, as at the present moment he is very busy reading a book (which has just appeared in the Russian language, and the reading of which gives him no small amount of trouble) on the condition of the Russian peasantry, 0 which it appears is exactly the reverse of what the imaginative Careyc represents it to be—anything but enviable.
'Happiness doesn't grow in Russia.
' This book has just appeared in the nick of time, it is very important.
Moor should in his second volume41 make known the facts contained in it.
Meanwhile the French translation of the first volume is steadily progressing.

30 October 1869 'Dans une pauvre maison, dans une chambre plus pauvre encore, où ne se trouvent que deux chaises, une table, un lit et quelques planches pour des livres,' 3 Paul writes us, he found Mr Keller (the translator) busy at his work.
He is young, intelligent, enthusiastic.
Paul is delighted with him, and particularly admires his 'grand pouvoir travailleur et énergie' b — and indeed who could help doing so? For the sake of pursuing his studies (he occupies himself with several sciences, but principally with the social science), this young man lives in a state of comparative misery.
His father is a wealthy manufacturer, whose factory he superintended during seven years, but feeling disgusted with his 'métier de gardechiourme ,c Mr Keller gave up his position.
Paul met two more socialists at Mr Keller's house.
'Le parti socialiste,' il nous écrit, 'se constitue à Paris et commence à tenir le haut du pavé, quoiqu'il n'ait pas de journal, il a les réunions publiques et l'agitation personnelle.
' d No doubt the socialist party has risen on the ruins of the Simons, Pelletans, Bancels, Gambettas.
The French people have discovered that the emptiest vessels make the greatest noise—have watched those big-mouthed ranters turning tail and won't give them credit for their good intentions, their hopes, 'that they who run away, may live to fight another day'.
In London the event of the week has been a Fenian demonstration, got up for the purpose of praying the government for the release of the Irish prisoners.
452 As Tussy has returned from Ireland677 a stauncher Irishman than ever, she did not rest until she had persuaded Moor, Mama and me to go with her to Hyde Park, the place appointed for the meeting.
This Park, the largest one in London, was one mass of men, women and children, even the trees up to their highest branches had their inhabitants.
The number of persons present were by the papers estimated at somewhere about 70 thousand, but as these papers are English, this figure is no doubt too low.
There were processionists carrying red, green and white banners, with all sorts of devices, such as 'Keep your powder dry!', 'Disobedience to tyrants is a duty to God'.
And hoisted higher than the flags were a profusion of red Jacobin caps, the bearers of which sang the Marseillaise—sights and sounds that must have greatly interfered " Ina poor house, in a room still poorer, where there are only two chairs, a table, a bed and a few bookshelves -b great working capacity and energy -c profession as a warder -d The socialist party, he writes, is constituting itself in Paris and beginning to come to the fore; although it has no press organ it holds public meetings and carries on agitation among individuals.

All at home send you their best wishes for the New Year, in which I most heartily join.
We were so sorry to hear of your illness, and trust that by this time you have quite recovered from the effects of it.
Moor is in pretty good health at this moment, that is to say, comparatively speaking.
—A few days ago Engels paid us a visit of a few hours.
He was on his way to Barmen where he intends spending the Christmas days with his mother.
513 He looked particularly well, and very happy at having effected his escape from the counting-house, in which he felt like a fish out of water.
He works hard at his book on Ireland.

I suppose it will be something of a pendant to The Condition of the Working-Class in Englands It gave us much pleas­ ure to see that you sympathize with us as regards the Irish question.
We are all of us downright Fenians.
On the day we received the news of Donovan's d election we all danced with joy—Tussy was quite wild.

Jenny Marx (daughter) to Kugelmann.
27 December 1869 549 shriek in chorus 'A felon convicted has been elected—horror of horrors!' Then having in concert rung the changes on those to them magical words, the hireling crew fell foul of each other—the Tory papers abused Gladstone, declaring this election to be the fruit of his policy—the Whig organs ranted on the subject of ingratitude and lamented the fate of a country in which messages of peace and good will were thus answered, in which treason flaunts itself in the daylight and the praises of murder are sung.
The British government at once despatched thousands of soldiers to the Sister Isle.
It must be admitted that as the Tories say, Gladstone's measure of Church disestablishment678 has already borne fruit.
Religious fanaticism is dying a natural death, the hostility of Catholics and Protestants is at an end, there is a split in the Orange camp679 and Orangemen, Ribbonmen436 and Fenians are uniting against their common enemy the British Government.
Consequently the influence of the priests is vanishing, the Irish movement is no longer in their hands, in fact the election of Donovan Rossa was in direct opposition to the clerical party.
For instance, these gentlemen being opposed to the release of the political prisoners, convoked meetings for the tinkering of some sort of land bill, which meetings were forcibly broken up by the people, who declared that they would come to no terms with the British Government, until the prisoners had been released.
As the Government turned a deaf ear to amnesty meetings etc.
the people elected Donovan Rossa, the Fenian, in defiance of the British Government and of the Irish professional agitators, lay and clerical, whose insincerity they had at last discovered.
Meanwhile the noblest Irish are pining in British dungeons.
It is impossible to describe the sufferings of these men.
Donovan Rossa had been at one time for 35 days kept in a dark cell with his hands manacled behind his back, night and day, and was not loosed even to take food—thin porridge—which was left for him on the floor of the cell.
Altogether, my dear Doctor, England is at this moment a country of horrors.
In the East End of London famine fever has broken out—in the workhouses the paupers are murdered wholesale.
The doctors no longer satisfied with the corpses of the paupers are making their experiments on the living, and yet the time is still fresh in my memory when the English Press expressed the greatest indignation at the Practice of the vivisection of animals in France.
Last week a case happened in Wales, which makes one's hair stand on end.
A Welsh farmer had spread the report that his daughter, a girl of 12 years, had lived without food for two years.
550 6.
Jenny Marx to Engels.
About 17 January 1870 Now though this poor Welshman received money for exhibiting his child, it is possible (in Wales the belief in witches etc.
still exists) that he is half a lunatic and believed his tale.
But that doctors of the first London hospitals should have done so, seems incredible.
Be that as it may, they formed a commission and appointed nurses from Guy's Hospital to go to Wales in order to watch this so-called fasting girl during a fortnight.
Daily these same physicians issued bulletins to the public as to the girl's state.
For six days they kept her without food, and on the seventh the miserable child died.
On the night before the child's death, Doctor Davies told the father of the girl that there was no danger, and on being examined that gentleman declares, that he did not suggest food because he did not like to 'offend' the father.
How very polite and considerate to be sure! I will try jo procure the whole case for you.
It certainly does not give one a high opinion of the medical profession in England.
I do believe that if a person were to declare that he can walk over red-hot iron-bars unhurt or jump out of a window, doctors would be found to investigate the matter.
We shall return to the trials by ordeal one of these days!680 With best wishes for the new year Believe me, very sincerely yours Jenny Marx First published in Movimento Operaio, Reproduced from the original No.

Published in English for the first time JENNY MARX TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER [London, about 17 January 1870] Dear Mr Engels, Seldom can a HAMPER have arrived so à propos as that of yesterday.
The crate had just been unpacked, and the 50 slim fellows were standing in rank and file in the kitchen when Dr Allen and his PARTNER, a young Scots doctor, arrived to operate on 6.
Jenny Marx to Engels.
About 17 January 1870 551 poor Moor, so that, immediately after the operation, Moor, and his two Aesculapii could refresh themselves with the delicious Braunenberger.
The business was very bad this time.
For 8 days we had applied all the remedies, compresses, basilicum etc.
, etc.
, that have so often been of help: but all in vain.
The abscess steadily grew, the pain became unbearable, and no opening or discharge could be induced.
It had to be lanced, so Moor finally decided to take the unavoidable step of calling in a doctor.
Immediately after the very deep incision he felt great relief, and although he was not yet free of pain this morning, he is on the whole much much better, and will, we hope, have recovered in a few days.
But now I must go into action against him with a whole register of sins.
Since returning from Germany, and particularly since the Hanoverian campaign,349 he has been unwell, coughed continually, and instead of looking after himself, began to study Russian hammer and tongs, went out seldom, ate infrequently, and only showed the CARBUNCLE under his arm when it was already very swollen and had hardened.
Dear Mr Engels, how often in the past years have I wished that you had been here!! Some things would have been different.
Now I hope that he will take this latest experience as a warning.
Please, dear Mr Engels, don't make any remarks to him in your letters about this.
He is very irritable at the moment, and would be very cross with me.
But it has been a great relief to pour out my heart to you, since I am quite incapable of changing his lifestyle in any way.
Perhaps it would be possible to speak to him seriously through Gumpert, when he comes to Manchester once again.
He is the only doctor in whom he still has confidence.
Dominant in our house at present is a general disdain for all medicine and all doctors; but they are still a necessary evil; you can't get along without them.
What do you say to the second New Year present with which Laura has presented usa? I hope that the rapid pace will soon come to an end; otherwise we could sing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

30 January 1870 7 JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN IN HANOVER [London,] 30 January 1870 My dear Doctor, I write these lines to tell you why Moor has not answered your letters.
Since about three weeks he has had carbuncles under his arm, which were so painful that poor Moor was unable to move his arm.
Twice the doctor cut them.
3 This operation brought with it almost instantaneous relief.
At the present moment I am happy to say, our dear patient is almost well again, though of course he still feels very weak, the necessary effect of the great strains he has suffered.
Now that it is over I think it is a good thing the illness came to a crisis as Moor had been tormented by it for months past—you will remember he was anything but well at Hanover and in that state he continued up to the present time—sometimes a little better, sometimes worse.
Your correspondence with Jacoby amused him much.
b To judge from that venerable gentleman's rambling answer, your letter to him must have hit pretty hard.
I have also to acknowledge the receipt of your letter to myself—the contents of which surprised me not a little and have made me very anxious to hear the final decision of the Philistines of the Künstler-Verein.
" Considering that this Verein is composed of the cream of Hanoverian society, the 'cultivation' of the Upper Classes, on the strength of which they consider themselves so much superior to the Working Classes, certainly is something to be mightily proud of! The only pity is that these blockheads have succeeded in annoying you and in robbing you of so much time.
I must ask you and dear Trautchend to forgive me for not having before this informed you of the advent of a little stranger in Lafargue's family.
On the second of January Paul announced to us the arrival of a girl in the rue du Cherche-Midi.
She is exactly a year older than her brother," the birthdays of the children being on the same day.
f A few days ago Laura wrote us that she is much stronger.

There is a mistake in the original: 'older' instead of 'younger'.
-f 1 January Her letter was accompanied by a most interesting lot of French journals—the Marseillaise, Cloche, Réforme, Rappel and Pays.
These journals give one a capital idea of the present state of France.
The hubbub and excitement prevailing in the capital are incredible.
All parties, nay all individuals are at loggerheads.
Rochefort is at daggers drawn with his quondam friends and supporters Ver-morel, Villemessant etc.
etc.
whom he openly denounces as mouchards, 3 and they again in their organ, the Figaro, return tit for tat.
As for the Bancels, Gambettas, Pelletans, Favres etc.
, that tribe of big-mouthed spouters of sonorous phrases have altogether vanished—they are no-where.
Experience has taught the people what they have to expect from the bragging 'gauche'.
h Not one of them dared to show his face at Victor Noir's funeral or to raise his voice in the Chambers.
Rochefort, supported by brave old Raspail, has annihilated them—doomed them to a living death.
Whatever Liebknecht may say to the contrary, 681 Rochefort reigns supreme at Paris, and the wisdom of his conduct in preventing a collision with the military on the day of the interment is now apparent to all.
Were Liebknecht to read the Pays, he would see that Cassagnac and consequently the Government do not disguise their rage at the fact—'que le peuple ne savait pas mourir pour ses convictions,' 'qu'ils n'ont pas élevé dans l'air le drapeau rouge'.
c Formerly, shrieks the ferocious clown Cassagnac: 'les révolutionnaires étaient des hommes de coeur, des hommes de principes qui se battaient pour des idées, et qui savaient bien que ni canons, ni fusils, ni bayonettes ne tiendraient devant la poitrine nue du peuple qui réclame son droit'.
d682 These 'naked breasts' would indeed have been a feast for the cannons and chassepots250 of the Man of December," the more so, stationed as they were on the outskirts of Paris, where barricades could not be erected and where consequently the 100,000 soldiers would not, as in the narrow streets of Paris, have been exposed to a hand to hand scuffle with the people.
— Then the Volksstaat also gives an incorrect account of the strike at Creuzot.
683 It is not true that the workmen demand higher wages and a diminution of the hours of labour.
They simply requested to have the management of their sick fund in their own hands and not in those of a police agents -b left -c that the people did not manage to die for their convictions, that they did not raise the red banner -d 'the revolutionaries were brave people, people with principles, the people who fought for ideas and knew well that neither cannons nor rifles nor bayonets can resist the naked breasts of the people demanding their rights.
' -e Napoleon III M.
Schneider, further that their fellow-workman Assy should not be sent away and that an under-master who had oppressed them, should be dismissed.
These are the true causes of the strike.
The French Government and the official press declare them to be due à l'excitation artificielle.
3 M.
Géroult, of the Opinion Nationale, montre les sociétés secrètes dominant, donnant des mots d'ordre et des consignes.
b 684 These societies are of course, the International, from which Assy, the leader of the strike, is said to have received 55,000 frs.
The Times reprints these statements and endorses them.
c Would they were true! It is a thousand pities the International cannot keep pace in its doings with the brilliant imaginings of these worthies.
It is a significant fact that some of the soldiers sent to Creuzot at once fraternized with the miners.
Four of these soldiers are to be tried for having attempted to enlist their comrades in the people's cause.
In Yorkshire a strike has also taken place, the workmen claiming the management of their own sick fund and protesting against the refusal of the Employers to allow the men to combine.
As ever since the year 1824 the right of combination has been legalised in England, the masters are in fact acting in direct opposition to the laws of the country, notwithstanding which the Government supplies them with soldiers to do their bidding.
The particulars of the strike are exactly like those of Creuzot— free constitutional England and despot-ridden France—do not differ—both countries have soldiers ready at hand to shoot down the men who have the courage to assert that they think they have intelligence enough to manage their own funds—their hard earned savings.
According to an estimate made by a correspondent to one of the English papers, staying at Creuzot,— the workmen lose by the strike 8,000£ a day (wages) whilst the loss to the masters is about 40,000£W a day.
Will you please give my best love to Trautchen and thank her for her letter.
I will write to her very soon.
Please also tell her that I must call upon her to hand over a certain little bracelet to 'Käuzchen', d for whom it was destined.

2, Milan, 1955 Jenny Marx the original Published in English for the first 8 PAUL LAFARGUE TO MARX IN LONDON Paris, [18 April 1870] My dear Mr Marx,c I have just returned from the labour federation conference about which Laura wrote you in her letter.
627 All the sections of the International, all the labour groups and all the corporations were convoked644; each group sent one or two delegates.
There were at least 1,200 or 1,300 members of the International or delegates from different labour groups.
The Rules which had been drawn up by a commission were adopted unanimously; except for paragraph 2 to which was added a new amendment, the gist of which is that all the sections would appoint substitute delegates who would be prepared to assume their functions should the government ever arrest the members of the Federal Council.
This proves to you how far the working class has come along; your advice given in the Basle manifesto 'if you want freedom you must take it' was heeded and understood.
685 Thanks to the International, which, owing to the federal bureau of labour societies, has made enormous strides since the last elections, the working class has a sense of its power and wants to take action whatever the cost.
The mutualist group686 is shattered; it was not a Gertrud Kugelmann -b and master of plastic movement (Ludwig Kugelmann).

18 April 1870 represented at the conference; it vigorously opposed all calls for federation.
What was most encouraging about the assembly was the need for centralisation felt by all members as well as the acute and precise awareness the working class had of its individuality as a class and of its antagonism towards the bourgeoisie.
As champion of class struggle, you would have enjoyed attending this rally.
Following the Rules vote delegates spoke about the plebiscite and of the manner in which the working class ought to conduct itself; all the speakers were in favour of abstention but considered it an opportune time to draw up a manifesto.
A commission was appointed of which I am a member.
It met that same evening to discuss the manifesto's groundwork, etc.
687 The document should contain the following three main points: 1) The empire is not recognised as having the right to ask questions; 2) insofar as the empire represents the bourgeoisie, the people have nothing to do with the improvements of the imperial constitution; 3) the necessity of abstaining or casting a blank ballot must be impressed upon peasants.
Appointed as literary editors were Tolain, Avrial, Paul-Laurent, etc.
.
.
That's what happened yes­ terday.
You must have seen in the Marseillaise the big notice of the French section688 ; fortunately, however, it has as much influence here as a spit in the sea.
When the Federal Council is constituted an order will be given to the Marseillaise not to print anything on the International without the authorisation of the Federal Council; you must know that the Marseillaise is at the mercy of the International and that if the latter ever placed its notices in the Réveil, the Marseillaise would die.
I could get myself appointed by any section as a member of the Federal Council but I believe it would be better if I were the representative of the London Council; would you like to appoint me next Tuesday representative of the Council to the Paris federation? The International has some invaluable members here; Varlin in particular has a talent for organisation and an influence which cannot be overestimated.
Combault, delegate of the Vaugirard section is also an invaluable member; he is a most eloquent speaker, is adept at handling matters in a lively and amusing fashion and is liked even by those he lampoons.
He has the wit of a Gaudissart.
Thank you for your letter.
I shall heed your advice but I do not believe that it will sway Verlet, who is more of an enthusiast than a tactician.
689 As for my father, I 8.
Paul Lafargue to Marx.
18 April 1870 557 believe you will do well to speak to him in such a manner; it will be better for you, for him and for me.
You think that the pseudonym Paul-Laurent is altogether sentimental in origin; 'sentiment' does in fact play into it to a small degree, but there is more to it than that, as the following item published in the Libre pensée will prove to you.
'In our last issue we said that our collaborator Paul Lafargue, not wishing to be confused with the Lafargues of the Figaro and Paris-faillite stores, felt compelled [s'était senti forcé] to add the name Laurent.
The inveterate wit of Figaro, a purist of broken French, informs us that the rules of syntax do not allow the figurative use of the verb 'to feel' [sentir].
Do not the words 'vil me sens' bring to mind in the Lafargue in question (Gustave) the name of a certain person (Villemessant)? At any rate the scholar Guguste, whose every lucubration is felt to reveal his character [sentent la terroir] should try hard to avoid appearing pedantic [sentent le pédant] if he does not want people to see just how ignorant he really is [qu'on ne sente trop son ignorance].
' 690 Since the Libre pensée is a purely literary newspaper it will not be possible to publish the Rules in it, but once the Federal Council reprints the Rules I shall, if I am a member of it, oversee the operation most carefully 617; that will be more important.

8 May 1870 9 JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) TO LUDWIG AND GERTRUD KUGELMANN IN HANOVER [London,] 8 May 1870 Many many thanks my dear Mr and Mrs Kugelmann for the beautiful presents you have sent me.
I don't know which delight me more—the engravings or the songs—my eyes and ears are equally busy.
The studs have given Moor great pleasure, and indeed the flowers are most artistically worked.
He is also delighted with the tapestry of Leibniz and has already given it a place in his study, where we have stuck it on the wall over the mantel-piece.
a Unfortunately the blue paper of the tapestry has injured the beautiful engraving representing the death of Caesar, having covered it with blue colour.
Altogether the engravings have been damaged by the way in which they were packed,— Kaulbach's history is partly torn.
However we hope, the picture-framer will be able to patch it up again.
The box only reached its destination yesterday afternoon (Saturday)b—so it must have been a very long time travelling.
I also have to thank you—last though not least—for your kind letters and good wishes for my birthday.
0 I was sorry to hear that you, dear 'doctor', are again unwell, and trust soon to have a better account.
Moor also is far from well, having caught a very severe cold.
All the other inmates of Modena Villa, four cats and dog included, are well, but in a great hubbub, in which they have been ever since last Sunday, when the news came from Paris that a plot against Bonaparte's life had been discovered.
Of course you have seen from the German papers that the imbecile French government attempted at first to implicate the International in this affair, and that a great number of its members, forming the Paris and Lyons branches of the International, have been arrested.
642 The flunkeys of the English and French press of course availed themselves of this opportunity to make furious onslaughts on the International and to call upon their respective governments to suppress that odious Association as the root of all evils.

8 May 1870 559 that, the French government has however been obliged to declare that the International has nothing to do with the plot, and that its members are solely being prosecuted for the crime of belonging to an 'illicit society'.
Moor has written a declaration, unanimously adopted by the General Council, in which he repudiates any complicity of the International in the affair.
3 According to the French government, M.
Gustave Flourens is deeply implicated in the plot, and as that gentleman is in England, the French government has been secretly asking the English government to deliver him up; but Mr Gladstone, who is well aware that the doing so would cost him his premiership, (as it did Palmerston in the case of Simon Bernard b), declares that the ministry can do nothing in the matter without further proofs of M.
Flourens' culpability.
But in reality there are no proofs against M.
Flourens in the hands of the French government, for granted it be proved that he sent money to Paris for the purpose of arming the people with bombs in case an insurrection should break out, that does not imply that he had anything to do with the intended assassination of the Emperor.
Last Sunday (my birthday) when the news of the discovered complot reached us M.
Flourens was at our home—so you can imagine that my birthday was anything but a tranquil or a gay one.
We did not know at the time but what M.
Flourens might not be at once arrested.
He is the son of the celebrated naturalist of that name and has himself written a book on Ethnography 0 and delivered lectures at the Collège de France.
He is a most extraordinary mixture of a savant and an homme d'action.
d The good result of the plot is that it has forced the man of December6 to throw off his liberal mask and to show himself in his true colours.
A system of blanche terreur 1 prevails at Paris.
Yesterday all the opposition papers were confiscated, the people are being goaded to a state of desperation.
There is no knowing what will happen to-day.
I continue to write to the Marseillaise, several of my letters have been quoted in The Irishman, the national paper of Ireland.

I have now found a house, which charms all of us because of its wonderful open situation.
Jenny and Tussy were with me, and both find it particularly nice.
Because of its position and interior fittings it is naturally rather more expensive than Shrewsbury Villa, for which the man insists on £55.
Our present house costs £60.
It is next to Primrose Hill, so all the FRONT rooms have the finest and openest view and air.
And round about, in the side streets, there are SHOPS of all sorts, so your wife will be able to buy everything herself.
Now for the interior fittings.
Basement, big attractive kitchen with large range.
Next to this, a very spacious bathroom with large bathtub and cheminée/ BACK a Franziska Kugelmann -b Gertrud Kugelmann -c fireplace 10.

The two bottom rooms are just being papered.
I think you could scarcely find a better house, and I am convinced your wife will like it very much.
Its situation is just too cheerful and amusing.
You scarcely need to leave the house to be in the open and see thousands of people.
It is naturally of the utmost importance that you and your wife see it for yourselves, and as quickly as possible, since a house situated as well as this one will certainly go quickly.
But if it is not to your taste I have found another 2 nearby; but they are not situated in such a pleasant way.
It would be best if your wife came with you right away and saw for herself.
You know we shall be very happy to have her with us.
Write straight away about it, so we know whether we should go on looking or whether you will be coming.
I would like to get these lines into the post this evening so that you might consider the matter in the course of the day.
Therefore, a hasty adieu from Your Jenny Marx First published in MEGA Abt.

17 July 1870 11 JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN IN HANOVER [London,] 17 July 1870 My dear Doctor, I hope you -do not think that laziness or negligence has had anything to do with my silence.
The fact is, that I no sooner received your letter than I wrote to Mr Pigott, the editor of The Irishman to enquire of him where I could obtain a photograph of O'Donovan Rossa.
Mr Pigott wrote to say that he was unable to give me any information on the subject (the British Government does not allow the portraits of the Fenians to be sold) but that he had sent my letter to Mrs Rossa, as that lady could perhaps procure for me a photograph of her husband.
Now I have waited from day to day for a letter from Mrs Rossa—but in vain—and as I think it will be of no use to wait any longer, I write these lines to ask you whether the enclosed print,3 which appeared some time ago in The Irishman will be of any use to Mr Risse? It certainly is a very bad likeness—but it is better than nothing.
It would be a thousand pities to give up the excellent plan of publishing Rossa's portrait.
Its publication would greatly annoy John Bull—for the British Government dreads nothing so much as that its infamous treatment of the Fenian prisoners should become known on the Continent.
Indeed, the Prison Enquiry is solely got up for the purpose of hushing up the unpleasant truths that were oozing out.
On the eve of the Enquiry, the pretended object of which is to elucidate things, the prisoners are more closely guarded than ever, lest they might inform their friends of the treatment they are undergoing.
A few days ago Mrs Luby, wife of one of the prisoners, visited her husband to bear to him the tidings of his mother's death, (grief for her son's sufferings hastened Mrs Luby's death) and though the unfortunate woman had not seen her husband since three years, she was not allowed to see him face to face without the intrusion of a jailor.
Mrs Luby was led into one huge iron cage grated with heavy iron bars, Luby a At the beginning of the letter there is a note by Kugelmann: 'Rossa's portrait is missing'.
11.
Jenny Marx (daughter) to Kugelmann.
17 July 1870 563 was brought from his cell to another cage grated also with heavy iron bars, apart from that in which the wife was detained.
A jailor stood close beside the prisoner watchful, ready to interfere should he utter a word relative to the Prison treatment.
But poor Luby had no need to complain—his pallid, shrunk and shrivelled form spoke but too eloquently of a tale of horrors.
The fact is that Mrs Luby did not even recognize her husband— so altered, and aged does he look.
The friends of the prisoners being thus carefully excluded, the evidence of the prisoners suppressed, it is not difficult to guess that the whole commission will turn out to be a regular sham from beginning to end.
As the governors, jailors, warders are to have it all their own way in the coming inquiry, the end of it all will be that the venal scribes of the press will be enabled to paint in glowing colours the amenities of English prison life and to brand the statements of O'Donovan Rossa as so many lies! For the notes required for the preface of Mr Rissé's book 692 I addressed myself to Engels who with his usual amiability and promptitude at once sent me the enclosed remarks 3 which will I think prove of interest to the German public.
As regards Carlsbadb I am sorry to say that thanks to that desperate gambler at Parisc our long projected voyage has come to nothing.
To travel without a passport is of course an impossibility in the present state of affairs and to obtain one equally out of the question.
Even to naturalised Englishmen the British Government refuses passports.
308 But Moor will himself write to you on the subject.
Tell Trautchend I will also write to her in a few days to give vent to my disappointment—and please will you also tell that lady that I think she has grown unconscionably lazy.
I have not heard from her for months.
What do you think of the war? We have not yet recovered from our surprise and indignation at the turn affairs have taken.
It is not easy to reconcile oneself to the thought that instead of fighting for the destruction of the Empire, the French people are sacrificing themselves for its aggrandizement, that instead of hanging Bonaparte they are prepared to enroll themselves under his banner.
Who could have dreamt of such things a few months ago when the Revolution in Paris seemed a fact.
This revival of chauvinism in the 19th Century is indeed a hideous farce693! a F.

—3 2 Engels visited Marx in London between 1 and 5 April 1868 to attend the wedding of Laura Marx and Paul Lafargue.
—3, 5, 7, 10 3 Marx is referring to the Parliamentary elections to be held in November 1868 on the basis of the second Reform Bill of 1867.
The law extended suffrage to people resident in town for a period of not less than 12 months and renting houses or flats for no less than £10.
In the counties, the right to vote was granted to tenants with an annual income of above £12.
Suffrage was granted to a section of skilled workers.
However, it was not extended to Scotland and Ireland.
—3, 375 4 Marx is referring to the stand of the British trade union leaders in the 1867-68 election campaign, when George Odger, William Cremer, George Potter et al.
urged the workers to come to an understanding with the Liberals and in fact refused to draw up an independent and class-conditioned election programme.
In the course of the elections, trade union leaders frequently withdrew their candidatures in favour of one election coalition or another with which they were affiliated.
A case in point is George Odger, who was nominated in Chelsea (London).
During the 1868 election campaign, Liberal leader Gladstone publicly promised to settle the Irish question, which since the autumn of 1867 acquired a sharper edge due to a new upsurge of the national liberation movement in Ireland against British colonial oppression.
He came out with the slogans 'to pacify Ireland' and 'to reconcile England and Ireland' and he also promised a church reform.
In his speech in the House of Commons on 3 April 1868, Gladstone likened the Tory policies in Ireland to the conquest of England by the Normans (see The Times, No.
26090, 4 April 1868).
Marx warned the leaders of the British labour movement against the dangerous influence of social demagogy inherent in the Liberals' election platform on the Irish question.
Trade union leaders, Lucraft in particular, actually supported bourgeois Radicals in their assessment of the Irish Fenians (see Note 86).
— 3 566 Notes 5 The reference is to Freiligrath's letter written on 3 April 1868, in which he thanks Marx for a copy of Volume One of Capital sent to him in September 1867 and congratulates him on his daughter Laura's marriage.
The letter contained the following opinion of Capital: 'This is precisely the book one would wish to study, and its success has not been quick and loud in coming, but its hidden impact will be all the more profound and durable.
I know that on the Rhine, many young merchants and factory-owners are delighted by your book.
In that environment, it will attain its real purpose; for the scholars, it will be, apart from this, an indispensable source.
'—4, 8 6 Marx has in mind his letter to Freiligrath of 20 July 1867 (see present edition, Vol.
42, p.
397).
In his reply, dispatched the same day, Freiligrath avoided giving a direct answer to Marx's question.
Late in April 1867, a committee was set up in London to collect donations for Ferdinand Freiligrath, who had found himself without means of subsistence owing to the closing down of the London branch of the Banque Générale Suisse of which he was manager.
On 25 and 26 April, the committee, which was made up of German petty-bourgeois emigres, appealed 'to all friends of German poetry' in England and other countries for a subscription.
Similar committees were set up in many German towns and in New York.
Accounts of the progress on the subscription were published by the Hermann.
Deutsches Wochenblatt aus London.
—4, 373 7 Engels is probably referring to the letter Wilhelm Liebknecht wrote to him on 29 March 1868.
—5, 8 8 In his letter to Engels of 25 February 1868 Otto Meissner requested assistance in drawing up a publisher's advertisement announcing the publication of Volume One of Capital so as 'to break silence through powerful advertisement'.
Simultaneously, Otto Meissner sent notices containing the table of contents to about thirty newspapers.
—5, 37 9 The reason for these opinions of the Demokratisches Wochenblatt published by Wilhelm Liebknecht was probably the anonymous article 'Märzgedanken', printed in No.
13 on 28 March 1868.
Reviewing the revolution of 1848-49 in Germany, its author (in all probability, Liebknecht himself) exaggerated the contribution of petty-bourgeois democrats to the campaign for the Imperial Constitution, specifically, of Gustav Struve, a leader of the Baden uprisings and Liebknecht's friend.
For Engels' opinion of these events, see his works 'The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution' and 'Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany' (see present edition, Vols.
10 and 11).
—5 10 Engels is referring to the article 'Auswanderung und Bürgerrecht', in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
14 of 4 April 1868, on the treaty between the North German Confederation and the USA on the citizenship of German émigrés.
The draft agreement was discussed in April 1868 in the North German Reichstag.
The North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) existed from 1867 to 1870 as a federative state under the aegis of Prussia.
It was set up on the initiative of the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck after Prussia's victory over Austria in 1866 and the disintegration of the German Confedera­ tion.
—6 11 A reference to Engels' intention to write a review of Volume One of Marx's Capital for The Fortnightly Review to which Professor Beesly was a contributor, (see Marx's letter to Engels of 8 January 1868, present edition, Vol.
42).
While Notes 567 working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from Capital, which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26).
The review was written around 20 May-1 June 1868, but rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, Vol.
20).

15).
—7 14 A reference to the speculative machinations of the Scottish economist and financier John Law in France between 1716 and 1720; he dealt with the issue of securities and the foundation of joint-stock trading companies.
The bank which he founded in 1716, and later transferred to the French Government, as well as a number of companies for trade with foreign countries, went bankrupt in 1720.
—7 15 The reference is to Johann Baptist Schweitzer's review of Volume One of Capital anonymously printed in twelve issues of Der Social-Demokrat between 22 January and 6 May 1868, under the heading 'Das Werk von Carl Marx'.

—8, 11, 13, 61 16 In March and April 1868, 3,000 building workers were on strike in Geneva.
They demanded that the working day be reduced to ten hours, wages be raised, and payment by the day be substituted by payment by the hour.
On the initiative of the Central Committee of the International's Geneva sections, the workers in other industries rendered assistance to the strikers.
In 'The Fourth Annual Report of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association' to the Brussels Congress of 1868 written by Marx it is stated: 'In the struggle maintained by the building trades of Geneva the very existence of the International in Switzerland was put on its trial.
The employers made it a preliminary condition of coming to any terms with their workmen that the latter should forsake the International.
The working men indignandy refused to comply with this dictate' (present edition, Vol.
21, p.
16).
The victory of Geneva workers was made possible by the solidarity action organised by the General Council in England, France and Germany.
—8, 11, 14, 94, 199, 209 17 François Graglia, member of the Committee of the Geneva Section of the International, was sent to Paris and London to arrange financial aid for the Geneva building workers who had gone on strike.
He stayed in London from 6 to 9 April, attended meetings of the French Section and the General Council, and, accompanied by Hermann Jung, visited a number of workers' societies.
—8 18 The bronze workers of Paris went on strike in February 1867 when, in response to their demand for fixed tariffs, their employers insisted that they dissolve their credit society, Société de crédit et de solidarité des ouvriers du bronze.
Thanks to the General Council, which discussed the matter at its meetings of 5, 12, 19 and 26 March and 2 and 9 April 1867 (see The General Council of the First International.
1866-1868.
Minutes, Moscow, 1964, pp.
101-03, 105-06, 107, 108), Paris workers received financial aid from the British trade 568 Notes unions.
The strike ended in a victory for the bronze workers, who managed to preserve their organisation.
The employers agreed to introduce fixed rates for individual types of work.

Petersburg's Birzheviye Vedomosty (Stock-Exchange News), Nos.
307 and 310, 15 and 18 November 1867.
Borkheim quoted Herzen in his letter of 2 April.
He decided to use Liebknecht's Demokratisches Wochenblatt to attack Herzen and applied to Marx for certain linguistic information.
Borkheim carried out his intention in the article 'Russische politische Flüchtlinge in West-Europa.

—10 24 The events in the Charleroi coalfields occurred in the spring of 1868.
In response to the mine-owners' decision to reduce production to four days a week and lower the wages by ten per cent, the workers declared a strike.
On 26 March, violent clashes took place between the workers and the police.
Twenty-two people were arrested and put on trial.
The Belgian Section of the International launched a wide campaign to support the strikers both in Belgium and abroad.
It organised protest meetings and gave wide coverage of the events in La Tribune du Peuple, La Liberté and other papers.
On 12 April it issued a manifesto to the workers of Belgium and other countries (see La Tribune du Peuple, No.
4, 19 April 1868).
The Section maintained regular contacts with the General Council.
The Charleroi events were discussed at the Council meetings of 21 April, 12 May and 2 June 1868 (see The General Council of the First International.
1866-1868.
Minutes).
The Brussels Section set up a special committee to brief lawyers for the defence of the detainees.
The lawyers managed to swing public opinion in favour of the defendants and on 15 August all of them were acquitted by the jury.
This led to a rise in the membership of the International in Belgium.
For the Geneva strike of building workers see Note 16.
From 14 to 17 April 1868 a general strike took place in Bologna.
The workers demanded that the income tax be cut down and distributed more fairly.
A number of meetings and a demonstration were held.
Troops were summoned to disperse the demonstration and numerous arrests were made.
— 11, 62 25 A reference to the newspaper reports on Eichhoffs lectures on the causes of modern trade crises ('Die Ursachen der Handelsstockungen der Gegenwart'), which he delivered in Berlin in February-May 1868.
In them, he quoted Capital and the Manifesto of the Communist Party, and used material that Marx had sent him.
Eichhoff's lectures did a great deal to advertise Volume One of Capital in Notes 569 Germany.
The reports were printed in Die Zukunft and the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.

15, 11 April 1868, which quoted Bismarck's speech in the Reichstag commission on debts: 'Since you refuse to pass a state law on debts, not recognising the Reichstag's right independently to lodge complaints against officials at the debt collection department,—well, then there will be no law on debts, and we shall be unable to raise a loan for the Navy.
'—19 36 As a result of the victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, in which the Kingdom of Hanover fought on the side of Austria, Prussia annexed Hanover in September of that year and turned it into a province, to which the operation of the Prussian constitution was extended in 1867.
George V, King of Hanover, fled to Austria, where he attempted to head a movement against affiliation 21-983 570 Notes with Prussia.
He failed and, on 1 February 1868, had to sign a treaty with Prussia under which he agreed to abdicate for a certain compensation.
However, as early as 2 March 1868, the Prussian government passed a resolution on the confiscation of the ex-King of Hanover's property and lands.
—19, 221 A reference to the first session of the Customs Parliament held between 27 April and 23 May 1868.
The Customs Union Parliament—the guiding body of the Customs Union reorganised after the war of 1866 and the signing, on 8 July 1867, of a peace treaty between Prussia and the South German states, which provided for the establishment of this body.
The Parliament comprised members of the North German Confederation's Reichstag and deputies from the South German states: Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hesse.
Bebel and Liebknecht were the two workers' deputies in it.
It was to deal exclusively with issues of trade and customs policies; Bismarck's intention gradually to widen its jurisdiction by encompassing political questions was met with stubborn opposition from the South German representatives (see Note 62).
—20 The German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei) was set up in 1865 and encompassed the democratic elements of the petty bourgeoisie and part of the bigger bourgeoisie, chiefly from South and Central German states.
As distinct from the National-Liberals, it opposed Prussia's supremacy and advocated the plan for the establishment of the so-called Great Germany incorporating both Prussia and Austria.
While pursuing an anti-Prussian policy, the People's Party voiced the particularist aspirations of some German states.
It was against Germany's unification as a single centralised democratic republic, advocating the idea of a federative German state.
In 1866, the German People's Party was joined by the Saxon People's Party, whose nucleus consisted of workers.
This left wing of the German People's Party had, in effect, nothing in common with it except anti-Prussian sentiments and the wish jointly to solve the problems of national unification in a democratic way.
Subsequently, it developed along socialist lines.
The main section of the Party broke away from the petty-bourgeois democrats and took part in founding the Social-Democratic Workers' Party in August 1869.
—20, 102, 231, 242, 257, 299, 304, 308, 313, 324, 428, 478, 513 A reference to the female suffrage meeting held in Manchester on 14 April 1868.
It was reported by The Bee-Hive Newspaper (No.
340, 18 April 1868).
—20 Paul and Laura Lafargue returned to London from Paris about 25 April 1868, and on 30 April moved into a flat rented for them on Primrose Hill (see Marx's letter to Engels of 30 April 1868, this volume, p.
25).
—20 After the first publication of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy appeared in 1859, Marx produced a lengthy economic manuscript throughout 1861-63, which was a second rough draft of Capital (the first was the manuscripts of 1857-58).
In 1863, he evolved the final plan for a four-book work, the first three books theoretical and the fourth, a historical and critical one.
Having finished work on the manuscripts of 1861-63, Marx began preparing them for the press in August 1863.
This work from 1863-65 resulted in the third rough draft of Capital, three books of a theoretical character.
The notes for the fourth book, the Theories of Surplus-Value, were incorporated in the manuscripts of 1861-63.
Later, having Notes 571 completed work on them, Marx went back to the first book.
On Engels' advice, he decided it should appear first.
Preparation for the press continued throughout 1866 and most of 1867.
The first German edition of the first book appeared in September 1867 as Volume One of Capital.
Under the plan agreed upon with Meissner, the publisher, the second and third books (devoted to the circulation of capital and the process of capitalist production as a whole) were to appear as Volume Two, while the fourth book on the history of economic theories was to be Volume Three of Capital.
Marx, however, had not completed the preparation of the last books of Capital for the press.
After his death, this was done by Engels, who published Marx's manuscripts relating to the second and third books as volumes Two and Three of Capital (1885 and 1894).
Engels also intended to prepare for the press and publish as Volume Four of Capital the above-mentioned manuscript of the fourth book, but did not have time to do this in his lifetime.
This edition presents this book of Capital as part of the Economic Manuscripts of 1861-63, (volumes 30-34) while Volumes One, Two and Three of Capital are to be found in volumes 35, 36 and 37 of the present edition respectively.
—21, 30, 61, 68, 119, 232, 234, 259, 408, 528, 545 42 In the first manuscript of the third book of Capital written by Marx in 1864-65, the entire text is divided into seven long chapters.
After Marx's death, while preparing the manuscript for the press, Engels substituted this division by division into parts.
In Volume Three of Capital, published by Engels in 1894, the chapter mentioned in the letter corresponds to Part II 'Conversion of Profit into Average Profit' (see present edition, Vol.
37).
—24 43 The first German edition of Volume One of Capital (1867) considers the changes in the structure of capital mentioned here in the c) section of Chapter VI, 'Das allgemeine Gesetz der Kapitalistischen Accumulation'.
Corres­ ponding to this section in the second (1872) and subsequent German editions of Volume One, is Chapter XXIII of Part VII.
Corresponding to this material in the English edition of 1887 edited by Engels is Chapter XXV, Part VII, 'The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation' (see present edition, Vol.
35).
—24 44 Here productive capital means industrial capital, as distinct from merchant capital.
Later, Marx evolved a special definition of productive capital in Part I of Volume Two of Capital (see present edition, Vol.
36).
—24 45 Marx's reference is to the erroneous tenet of Adam Smith's theory (see A.
Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Ld.
, 1776, Book I, Ch.
6) generally shared by bourgeois political economists according to which the value, and consequently the price of the commodity is reducible to neat revenue and does not include fixed capital.
Marx criticised 'A.
Smith's dogma' in Part III of Capital's Volume Two (present edition, Vol.
36).
—25 46 On 26 April 1868, Victor Schily asked Marx for his biographical data which J.

—26, 28, 30, 32, 38, 45, 55, 84, 160, 411 49 In his letter of 29 April 1868, Johann Baptist Schweitzer requested Marx to define the position of the workers' party on the bill on reducing taxes for pig iron to be discussed in the Reichstag.
Enclosed with the letter were the clippings 'Jahresbericht der Handelskammer von Elberfeld und Barmen' and 'Ein Circular der Herren Fabrikanten Funcke und Hück' (Annual Reports of the Elberfeld and Barmen Chambers of Commerce and the Circular of Messrs Factory Owners Funcke and Hück) (Hagen, 23 April).
Marx quoted them when drafting a reply to Schweitzer.
Having received Engels' notes on this question (see p.
29 of this volume) Marx replied to Schweitzer probably on 7 May (the letter has not been found).
In his article 'An die Mitglieder des Allgemeinen Deutschen Arbeitervereins (die Herabsetzung der Eisenzölle betreffend)' published by Der Social-Demokrat on 13 May 1868, Schweitzer referred to Marx as 'the outstanding scientific authority of our trend'.
The article also reprinted the above-mentioned documents in full.
In his letter to Marx of 13 May 1868, in which this article was enclosed, Schweitzer thanked Marx for 'precious judgement'.
— 26, 28, 30 50 A reference to the article featured by the Mannheimer Zeitung reviewing Volume One of Capital.

42), as well as in his review of Volume One of Capital for the Demokratisches Wochenblatt published on 21 and 28 March 1868, Engels advised the worker deputies to make 'themselves thoroughly conversant with' Capital, which would supply them with the necessary material for the debate on new handicraft trades Regulations in the Reichstag (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
336).
The draft regulations were discussed in the Reichstag in the spring of 1869 and were approved on 29 May (see Note 324).
—30 52 A reference to the spinning mill industry statistics for 1860 cited on page 186 of the first German edition of Volume One of Capital.
Preparing the second German edition which appeared in 1872, Marx used additional information supplied by Engels (see Note 59), cited exact data and corrected a number of factual mistakes which the first edition contained (see present edition, Vol.
35).
—30, 36 53 Marx's letter to Joseph Dietzgen dated 9 May 1868, is not extant in full.
The date has been established on the basis of Dietzgen's reply written on 20 May.

—35 59 The extant notebook II of Marx's economic manuscripts of 1861-1863 (see MEGA2 , II/3.

Page 87 of this notebook contains a phrase, 'Suggested by Engels.

' The figures cited further completely tally with the examples on page 186 of Volume One of the first edition of Capital which appeared in 1867.
However, this phrase is absent in the notebook Marx kept since April 1860 and until February-May 1863.
—36 60 These letters from Marx to Wilhelm Eichhoff have not been found.
— 36 61 An allusion to the rumour that, having returned to Germany in 1867 after a long period of emigration, Wilhelm Eichhoff had abandoned politics and refused on these grounds to join the political campaign against Stieber waged by Liebknecht in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt between April and June 1868.
However, as early as May, Liebknecht informed Borkheim that Eichhoff had promised to let him have the necessary anti-Stieber materials.
The content of Liebknecht's letters was known to Marx.
His associates began to distrust Eichhoff even more after he had been seen in the company of Berlin police officers, and especially after his speech at the inaugural meeting of the Democratic Workers' Society, which appeared in Die Zukunft newspaper in distorted form and was later reprinted by the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
43, 24 October 1868 (see this volume, pp.
151, 153).
Marx had done a great deal to clear Eichhoff's name.
On Marx's request, Eichhoff wrote to him on 31 October-1 November giving full explanations which convinced Marx of his dedication to the cause of revolution (see also Marx's letter to Engels of 16 April 1869).
—36, 266 62 Marx is referring to a Protest signed by representatives of South German states and four members of the Reichstag of the North German Confederation (see Note 10) on 7 May 1868.
The authors opposed Bismarck's intention to expand the competence of the Customs Union Parliament (see Note 37) by stretching it to cover political issues.
The text was printed by the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
20, 16 May 1868.
—38 63 Engels refers to Lasker's speech at the first session of the Customs Union Parliament held on 18 May 1868 (on the Customs Union Parliament, see Note 37).
—38 64 Marx is referring to Chapter II 'Die Verwandlung von Geld in Kapital' of the first German edition of Capital, Volume One.
In the second and subsequent 574 Notes German editions, it corresponds to Part II, and in the English edition of 1887, to Part II, Chapters IV-VI (see present edition, Vol.
35).
—39 65 A reference to Chapter I 'Waare und Geld' of the first German edition of Capital, Volume One.
Corresponding to it in the second and subsequent German editions, as well as in the English edition of 1887 edited bv Engels, is Part I (see present edition, Vol.
35).
—39, 68 66 A reference to the champions of the so-called 'currency principle', a trend in bourgeois political economy advocating the quantitative theory of money.
Jones Lloyd (Lord Overstone), Robert Torrens, George Arbuthnot and other representatives of this school maintained that the value and price of commodities are determined by the quantity of money in circulation, that the guarantee of stable currency is the obligatory backing of banknotes by gold and that their issue is regulated according to the import and export of precious metals, regarding violation of these 'laws' as the decisive cause of economic crises.
The attempt of the British Government to rely on the 'currency principle' theory (Bank Act of 1844, etc.
) failed, thus proving its scientific groundlessness and its impracticability (see critique of this theory in Marx's À Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, present edition, Vol.
29).
— 39 67 Marx lectured on wages in the London German Workers' Educational Society on 20 May 1868.
The German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the Just.
After the Communist League had been founded, the leading role in the Society belonged to the League's local communities.
In 1847 and 1849-50 Marx and Engels took an active part in the Society's work.
But on 17 September 1850, Marx, Engels and a number of their followers withdrew because the Willich-Schapper sectarian and adventurist faction had increased its influence in the Society.
In the late 1850s Marx and Engels resumed work in the Educational Society.
At the time of the First International, the Society functioned as its German Section in London.
It existed up to 1918 when it was closed down by the British government.

As a result of the First (1740-42) and Second (1744-45) Silesian wars, which formed part of the European war for Austrian succession, the most of Silesia was captured by Prussia.
Austria's attempts to recover the territory in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), sometimes referred to as the Third Silesian War, were futile.
—42 70 The Lausanne Congress of the International in 1867 designated Brussels as the venue of the next general congress (1868).
However, since the Belgian Chamber of Deputies had renewed the Aliens Law of 1835, under which any foreigner could be expelled from the country as politically unreliable, Marx raised the issue of not meeting in Brussels at the General Council sitting of 26 May 1868 (see The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No.
346, 30 May 1868).
The resolution on the transfer of the site of the Congress to London drawn up by Marx was read at the Council sitting of 2 June (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
6).
Notes 575 The speech made in the Chamber of Deputies by the Belgian Minister of Justice Jules Bara on 16 May 1868, in which he urged the deputies to abolish the convocation of the congress in Brussels, the protest of the Brussels Section of the International evoked by this speech and printed in the Tribune du Peuple No.
5, 24 May 1868, and the letters of De Paepe and Vandenhouten, the leaders of the Brussels Section, prompted Marx to propose a new resolution at the General Council's sitting of 16 June, under which Brussels remained the venue for the next annual congress.
The text of the resolution was included in the Minutes of the General Council meeting of 2 June 1868, and was also printed by The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No.
347, 6 June 1868.

25, 21 June 1868, carried a piece by Pierre Vésinier from London, 'Bulletin du travailleur', which featured in a distorted way the debate on changing the place of the International's congress at the 9 June General Council meeting and contained slanderous attacks on Hermann Jung and Eugène Dupont, the Council members.
In this connection on 22 June the central section in Brussels unanimously decided not to accept responsibility for Pierre Vésinier's article, and to voice the protest against making public the internal affairs of the International.
The protest of the Belgian Section was printed in La Cigale, No.

—46 76 The Schiller Institute, founded in Manchester in November 1859 in connection with the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth, was conceived as a cultural and social centre of the city's German colony.
At first Engels was critical of a society notorious for its tendency towards formalism and pedantry, and he kept aloof from it.
But after certain amendments had been made to its Rules, he became a member of its Directorate in 1864, and later its President, devoting much time to it and exercising a considerable influence on its activities.
In 1867-68, Engels was particularly occupied with its affairs since a new building was under construction.
While Engels was away from Manchester in 1868, the Directorate invited Karl Vogt, who was connected with Bonapartist circles and had been casting aspersions on the proletarian revolutionaries, to give a lecture at the society.
In view of this Engels decided that his political reputation would be compromised if he remained President (see this volume, p.
100 and present edition, Vol.
21, p.
18).
On 2 October the secretary Davisson approached Engels on behalf of the Directorate asking him to reconsider his decision, but Engels refused.
In April 1870 he was again elected member of the Directorate, but did not take an active part in its work.

Ihre Gründung, Organisation, politisch-sociale Thätigkeit und Ausbreitung.
Wilhelm Eichhoff conceived it in the summer of 1868 when his brother Albert, a publisher, planned to put out a Workers' Calendar for 1869.
Wilhelm Eichhoff proposed to write a leading item on the establishment, development and activity of the International Working Men's Association.
On 6 June 1868, he informed Marx of his intention and asked him to send the necessary material and help him with the article.
As early as 27 June Marx sent to Berlin a great number of documents of the Association, newspaper clippings and his own notes.
In his reply of 29 June Eichhoff thanked Marx for the material and informed him that he was going to use his notes word for word and supplement and expand them as advised by Marx.
Eichhoff's work grew into a pamphlet because of the abundance of material.
It was written with Marx's direct assistance.
Eichhoffs letters show that as his work progressed, Marx answered his numerous questions, gave advice, made suggestions, and wrote certain parts of the pamphlet.
From 12 to 22 July 1868, Marx edited the pamphlet and read the proofs.
On 29 July the work was completed and the edition came out in August (see present edition, Vol.

Under the Manifesto and the Statute on the Peasants Leaving the State of Serfdom signed by Alexander II on 19 February 1861, the peasants were granted personal freedom and the right to dispose of their property; the system of land ownership was preserved, and the peasants had to pay for the land allotments they received.
Until the payment had been made, they remained 'under Notes 577 temporary duty' and had to make payments in kind or do corvée for the landowner.

— 55 86 Fenians—Irish revolutionaries who took their name from the warriors of Ancient Erin.
The first Fenian organisations were founded in the 1850s in the USA and later in Ireland itself.
The secret Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, as the organisation was known in the early 1860s, aimed at establishing an independent Irish republic by means of an armed uprising.
The Fenians, who represented the interests of the Irish peasantry (see Marx's letter to Engels, 30 November 1867, present edition, Vol.
42), came chiefly from the urban petty bourgeoisie and intelligentsia and adhered to conspiratorial tactics.
The British Government attempted to suppress the Fenian movement by severe police reprisals (see Note 452).

—58 88 The London German Workers' Educational Society (see Note 67) jointly with certain other organisations in London held annual gala evenings to mark the anniversary of the June 1848 uprising of the Paris proletariat; members of the General Council also took part in these gatherings.
— 62 89 At a public meeting in Cleveland Hall, London, held on 29 June 1868, Félix Pyat read out an address, allegedly received by him from the secret society La commune révolutionnaire de Paris and moved a provocative resolution declaring the assassination of Napoleon III as the sacred duty of every Frenchman.
The resolution was published by The Bee-Hive, No.
351, 4 July 1868.
In response, at its meeting of 7 July, the General Council, on Marx's proposal, resolved to disavow Pyat's behaviour in a resolution to this effect (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
7).
When the General Council Resolution appeared in the press, a split took place in the French Section in London (see Note 72).
Eugène Dupont, Hermann Jung, Paul Lafargue expressed their disapproval of Pyat's adventurist and provocative tactics and withdrew from it (see this volume, p.
78).
Pyat's group lost contact with the International but continued to act on its behalf and repeatedly supported anti-proletarian elements opposing Marx's line in the General Council.
On 10 May 1870 the General Council officially dissociated itself from this group (see present edition, Vol.

In March 1868, they had been elected to replace the 15 previously arrested members of the first bureau (on the court trial over the members of the first bureau, see Marx's letters to Engels, 8 and 11 January 1868, present edition, Vol.
42).
The members of the second bureau were kept at the Paris Saint-Pelagie prison after they were brought to trial for the second time on 22 May 1868 on the pretext that no official permission had 578 Notes been granted for membership of the new Paris bureau.
The defendants were sentenced to three months' imprisonment and a fine.

— 67 98 Together with a letter of 9 July 1868, Kugelmann sent Marx a copy of the newspaper Literarisches Centralblatt für Deutschland of 4 July 1868, which contained an unsigned review of Volume One of Capital, analysed by Marx in the present letter.
Kugelmann also sent Marx his letter to Faucher written in connection with the review in the Vierteljahrschrift.

— 72 104 T}^ General Association of German Workers—a political organisation of German workers founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863, at a meeting of workers' societies.
Notes 579 Its foundation was an important step in the advancement of an independent nation-wide working-class movement in Germany and promoted the workers' emancipation from the ideological domination of the liberal bourgeoisie.
However, Lassalle, who had been elected chairman, and his followers chose to direct the Association's activities along reformist lines, restricting it to a public campaign for universal suffrage.
One of the items on the programme was the establishment of production cooperatives financed by the state, which were expected to resolve social contradictions.
The Lassallean leadership of the Association supported the Prussian government's policy of the unification of Germany from above, through dynastic wars.
Thanks to the experience of the working-class movement, and especially the International, and supported by Marx and Engels, the more advanced section of the Association began to drift away from the Lassallean dogmas.
The Lassallean leaders, who were afraid to lose their influence among the workers, were forced to manoeuvre.
The programme of the Hamburg Congress of the Association (which in its final version appeared in Der Social-Demokrat, No.
98, 21 August 1868) contained points that went against Lassalle's doctrine, i.
e.
, advocated complete political freedom, positively assessed Marx's Capital, and urged the international cooperation of the working class.
In the letter 'To the President and Executive Committee of the General Association of German Workers" (see present edition, Vol.
21), a reply to the invitation which had been extended to him, Marx gave his opinion of the programme and, as he remarked in a letter to Engels of 26 August, congratulated the members of the Association on 'having abandoned Lassalle's programme' (see this volume, p.
90).
The Hamburg Congress (22-26 August 1868) adopted important decisions: it approved the strike movement in principle, unanimously acknowledged that 'Marx had rendered outstanding services to the working class with his work Capital', and pointed to the necessity for joint action by the workers of different countries.
In fact, however, the Lassallean leaders continued to oppose its affiliation with the International and adhered to their former standpoint.
At the Gotha Congress (May 1875), the General Association of German Workers merged with the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party (the Eisenachers) founded in 1869 and headed by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht.
The united party assumed the name of the Socialist Workers' Party.
—73, 75, 98, 105, 115, 117, 132, 134, 358, 420 105 Engels is referring to Liebknecht's letter to Marx of 17 July 1868 about the arrangement made by Liebknecht and Schweitzer in Berlin in July 1868.
During the meeting, Liebknecht told Schweitzer about his and Bebel's intention to recommend the forthcoming congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations in Nuremberg (see Note 135) to adopt the programme of the International, and insisted that the Lassallean Association be affiliated with it, believing that this would remove the cause for dissent between the Lassalleans and the followers of Bebel and Liebknecht, and make unification possible.
— 73, 110 106 A reference to Kugelmann's letter to Engels of 26 July 1868, which stated that, according to Kertbény, Keil of Leipzig agreed to feature Marx's biography in Die Gartenlaube magazine.
However, the biography written by Engels was not printed.
In July 1869, Engels revised it for Die Zukunft newspaper, and it appeared in No.
185 under the heading 'Karl Marx' on 11 August 1869 (see present edition, Vol.
21).
—73, 77, 81 107 In the late 1850s-early 1860s, Beta, who was contributing to the newspaper Hermann.
Deutsches Wochenblatt aus London and was also a correspondent of Die Gartenlaube, which was published in Leipzig, repeatedly calumniated Marx in his articles.
For Marx's opinion of Beta's activities as a newspaperman, see his letters to Engels, 19 and 26 November and 11 (or 12) December 1859, and 10 January 1861, and his letters to Ferdinand Freiligrath, 23 November 1859 and 23 February 1860 (present edition, Vols.
40 and 41).
—74 108 On 23 July 1868, on behalf of the Union of German Workers' Associations (see Note 169) Bebel sent the General Council of the International an invitation to the Nuremberg Congress (see Note 135) in which he wrote: 'Among the more important items on the agenda the principal place belongs to the question of the programme.
.
.
We .
.
.
intend to recommend the Congress to adopt the programme of the International Working Men's Association and .
.
.
also suggest that the organisation be affiliated to the International Working Men's Association.
' The invitation was enclosed into Liebknecht's letter to Marx of the same date.
Liebknecht insisted that Marx go to Nuremberg as the General Council delegate, but Marx declined this offer.
The General Council meeting of 25 August 1868 decided that its representative at the Nuremberg Congress would be Georg Eccarius.
— 75 109 The solidarity congress of workers of all nationalities inhabiting Austro-Hungary, which was to be held in Vienna in September 1868, was banned by the government of Austria-Hungary.
— 75 110 Marx probably means two legal actions brought against Schweitzer in 1868.
On 14 February, speaking at a meeting in Berlin, Schweitzer said that the Royal police headquarters, by the repeated banning of meeting, had violated human rights.
Schweitzer's speech was interpreted as undermining the King's state power and he was sentenced to two weeks' imprisonment which he served in September 1868.
The Elberfeld court sentenced Schweitzer to three weeks' imprisonment for the distribution of leaflets, and he served his term in Berlin prison from 8 to 29 July 1868.
—75 111 Marx's reply to Schweitzer's letter of 28 June 1868 has not been found.
In his letter Schweitzer asked if Marx would be able to attend the Hamburg Congress of the General Association of German Workers (see Note 104).
If Marx agreed, Schweitzer intended, before going to prison (see Note ilO) to send him an invitation signed by 24 members of the Association's committee (see also this volume, pp.
89-90).
—76 112 Marx's notes refer to his biography written by Engels (s"e Note 106).
The first one refers to the Rheinische Zeitung für Politik, Handel und Gewerbe.
The newspaper was founded by members of the Rhenish liberal bourgeoisie which was opposed to Prussian absolutism.
In May 1842, Marx began to contribute to it, and in October became one of the editors.
It published a number of Engels' articles (see present edition, Vol.
2).
Under Marx's editorship, the newspaper began to follow an increasingly coherent democratic trend.
Its character, which was to a large extent determined by Marx's articles containing criticism of Germany's social, economic and political development (see present edition, Vol.
1) attracted the attention of the Prussian authorities.
On 12 November 1842, the government imposed a rigorous censorship of it, and on 19 January passed a decision banning the newspaper as of April 1843, and introducing even stricter censorship for the remaining period.
The decree was promulgated 581 on 21 January (see 'Erlass der drei Zensurminister betr.
Unterdrückung der Rheinischen Zeitung zum.
1.
April 1843,' Berlin, 1843, 21 January).
At the end of January 1843 Marx was already thinking of resigning the editorship (see Marx's letter to Ruge, 25 January 1843, present edition, Vol.
1, p.
397), but he did not consider it possible to carry out his intention at the height of the campaign for the repeal of the ban.
In March, however, he became convinced that changes in the editorial board could provide a chance of saving the newspaper, and he decided to resign officially from his post (the announce­ ment of his resignation was published on 17 March 1843.
See present edition, Vol.
1, p.
376).
But the royal rescript was not repealed.
The last issue of the newspaper appeared on 31 March 1843.
— 76 113 Marx is referring to the reprisals against the Neue Rheinische Zeitung published in Cologne in 1848-49.
In April-early May 1849, Minister of the Interior Manteuffel repeatedly urged the Cologne authorities to take legal action against the newspaper's editorial board (see present edition, Vol.
9, pp.
492-93, 496-97).
By the spring of 1849, 23 lawsuits had been brought against it.
However, the procurator's office, which had already failed twice to get a conviction from the jury (7 and 8 February 1849.
See present edition, Vol.
8, pp.
304-39) did not dare to challenge the newspaper on legal grounds.
On 16 May Marx was ordered to leave Prussia within 24 hours.
— 76 114 In a letter to Engels of 26 July 1868 (see Note 106) Kugelmann suggested that Marx's biography be printed under the heading 'Ein deutscher National­ ökonom'.
— 77 115 The Jacobin Club ('Société des amis de la constitution') —a political club founded at the time of the French Revolution, in October 1789; initially represented different political trends in the anti-absolutist camp.
— 79 116 A reference to Moses Hess' review of Volume One of Capital, which he had already begun writing in November 1867 for the French press.
Marx suggested that it should contain a synopsis of the theory of value as expounded in Capital.
In 1868, Hess tried for several months to get the review published in a number of newspapers, including Courrier français and Morale indépendante.
It is not known what has happened to the review.
— 79, 84 117 Marx considered the expediency of transferring the General Council to Geneva for the year 1869 in connection with the forthcoming Congress of the International in Brussels.
— 79 118 Engels refers to the resolution of the Communist League's Central Authority in London of 15 September 1850 (see present edition, Vol.
10, pp.
625-29) passed as a result of the adventurist activities of the Willich-Schapper faction which transferred the powers of the Central Authority to the Cologne district authority.
The Communist League—the first German mid international communist proletarian organisation set up under the lea:jershi'; ; of Marx and Engels in early June 1847 in London and operating until ;852.
Its programme and organisational structure were evolved with the direct participation of Marx and Engels.
On the instruction of the League's Second Congress held on 29 November-8 December 1847, which unanimously approved the principles of scientific communism elaborated by Marx and Engels, the two men wrote the League's programme, Manifesto of the Communist Party, published in February 1848 (see present edition, Vol.
6, pp.
477-519).
Notes During the 1848-49 revolution, the Communist League was the organisa­ tional centre and vanguard of the revolutionary movement in Germany.
After the defeat of the revolution, the Communist League was restructured in 1849-50 and continued working.
The 'Address of the Central Authority to the League' written by Marx and Engels in March 1850 (see present edition, Vol.
10, pp.
277-87) summed up the results of the 1848-49 revolution and emphasised the need to set up an independent proletarian party; it also developed the idea of permanent revolution.
The decision mentioned above was adopted as a result of the dissent, which became more acute in the summer of 1850, over the tactics to be adopted in order to protect the workers from the influence of the Willich-Schapper faction, which tried to make the League adopt an adventurist policy of starting revolution in total disregard of the objective laws and the situation prevailing in Germany and other European countries.
The faction's activities gave the police an excuse to stage provocative acts against the Communist League.
However, the transfer of the Central Authority to Cologne had certain undesirable consequences: the Cologne district authority proved incapable of exercising leadership over the entire League; moreover, the transfer had put the Central Authority in danger of police reprisals.
In fact, the police persecution and the arrests of May 1851 put an end to the work of the League in Germany.
On 17 November 1852, soon after the Communist Trial in Cologne, the League dissolved itself on Marx's suggestion, but its members continued their propaganda and revolutionary work.
The Communist League had played a major historical role as a school for proletarian revolutionaries and the embryo of a proletarian party, the forerunner of the International Working Men's Association.
— 80, 140, 397 119 In his letter to Marx of 7 August 1868, John Morley, editor olThe Fortnightly Review, explained that he had rejected Engels' review of Volume One of Capital (see Note 11) because he had 'no room for it'.
— 81, 84 120 As is apparent from Kugelmann's letter to Marx of 2 August 1868, the matter under discussion is the financial assistance to the weavers in Linden (Hanover) who were on strike.
Kugelmann wrote to Marx: 'A few days ago, the workers of the local mill, about 1,000 of them, launched an entirely justified strike.
They are working for about 14 hours a day and earn 3 shillings a week.
This is the first strike of such scope here, and its successful conclusion is of major importance.
.
.
It would be of particular significance for Germany if England could render support to the striking weavers.
The moral impact of this factor would be tremendous for both sides.
' This message was discussed at a meeting of the General Council held on 4 August 1868 (see The Bee-Hive, No.
355, 8 August 1868).
—82 121 In 1866-67 in London, Lafargue resumed and completed his medical studies interrupted by his expulsion from Paris University in 1865.
He returned to Paris in the autumn of 1868 and tried to get a doctor's certificate allowing him to set up a practice in France, without taking his exams for a second time, but failed.
After becoming involved in political activities and journalism, Lafargue abandoned the idea of a medical career.

— 90 132 In 1868, the members of the International in Naples maintained contacts with the International Working Men's Association through Eugene Dupont, member of the General Council, who was their delegate at the Brussels Congress.
The Neapolitan branch of the International became finally established in 1869.
It was the first section of the International Working Men's Association in Italy, and quite a large one at that; it had many workers among its members.
It was under the strong influence of the Bakuninists.
Early in 1871, however, it disintegrated; with the help of Cafiero, who received instructions from Engels, it was reorganised and maintained regular contacts with the General Council.
Cafiero kept its members informed about Engels' letters and the Association's documents.
Soon, it became the International's principal centre in Italy, but was routed by the police in August 1871.
— 91 133 Marx is referring to the reports of the International's Italian sections on the situation in the country.
Specifically, on 18 August 1868, a letter read out at the General Council meeting stated that 'at Bologna and vicinity the right of meeting is suppressed; the officers of the working men's societies are in prison' (see The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No.
358, 22 August 1868).
On 3 November 1867 at Mentana, the French army, jointly with the Pope's mercenary guards, defeated Garibaldi's army which had undertaken a new campaign against Rome to liberate it from the French and annex it to the Italian state.
—91 134 Since the members of the second bureau of the International's Paris sections (see Note 91) had been arrested, more than ten representatives to the Brussels Congress (see Note 138) were sent mostly by the French professional unions affiliated with the International.
Among them were mechanics, tin-smiths, cotton printers, bookbinders, house painters, marble and bronze workers.
— 91 135 The Nuremberg Congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations led by Bebel was held on 5-7 September 1868.
In all, 115 delegates from 93 sections in Germany, Austria and Switzerland were present.
Apart from Georg Eccarius, the official representative of the General Council, several other members of the International attended.
By 69 votes against 46, the Congress resolved to join the International Working Men's Association and adopted a programme recognising its basic principles.
It also elected a committee of 16 to carry out this resolution.
On 22 September 1868, the General Council approved the committee membership giving it the status of the Executive Committee of the International Working Men's Association in Germany.
On 7 September liberal bourgeois members, who found themselves in the minority and were opposed to the Congress resolutions, announced their withdrawal from the Union.
The Nuremberg Congress also resolved to organise trade unions and heard Liebknecht's report on armaments, in which he demanded that standing armies be disbanded.
The Congress was an important step towards the foundation of a proletarian party in Germany.
—91, 102, 115, 118, 128, 135, 166, 172, 249, 304 136 The Times published five reports by Eccarius on the work of the Brussels Congress of the International.
They appeared on 9, 11, 14, 15 and 17 September 1868 under the heading 'International Working Men's Congress (From a Correspondent)'.
Eccarius' reports on the Nuremberg Congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations (see Note 135) were not printed by The Times.
— 91, 97, 101 137 The last meeting of the General Council before the Brussels Congress was held on Tuesday, 1 September 1868.
It heard, and unanimously approved the report of the General Council to the Brussels Congress drawn up by Marx (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
12).
— 92 138 A reference to the Third Congress of the International held in Brussels on 6-13 September 1868.
It was attended by nearly 100 delegates representing workers of Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Spain.
Marx, who took part in the preparations for the Congress, was not present.
The annual report of the General Council written by Marx (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
12) was read out at the Congress on 7 September 1868.
The Congress adopted an important resolution on the necessity for introducing public ownership of railways, mineral resources, collieries and mines, forests and arable land.
This resolution showed that most of the French and Belgian Proudhonists had become supporters of collectivism and it marked the victory of proletarian socialism over petty-bourgeois reformism in the International.
The Congress also adopted the resolutions (drawn up by Marx) on the Notes 585 eight-hour working day, on the use of machinery and on the attitude towards the congress of the bourgeois-pacifist League of Peace and Freedom (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
204), and a resolution, moved by a group of German delegates, recommending the workers of all countries to study Marx's Capital and promote its translation from German into other languages (see Note 150).

Friedrich Lessner first quoted it in his reminiscences Vor 1848 und nachher published in the Deutsche Worte, Wien [1898].
There, the letter was erroneously dated 10 August.

— 93 141 Marx is probably referring to the question of the strike movement entered onto the agenda of the Brussels Congress on the suggestion of the French delegate Tartaret in addition to the points proposed by the General Council earlier.
The reports of the French Section in Geneva and the Belgian Section in Liege contained Proudhonist ideas on the issue; strikes were denounced as a matter of principle and only recognized as the inevitable evil.
The Congress resolution, passed despite the opposition of the Proudhonists, defined strikes as a necessary and legitimate means of struggle between labour and capital.
— 94 142 A reference to the Nuremberg Congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations (see Note 135) and the general congress of the Lassallean Association in Berlin (see Note 164).
— 94 143 Marx means the opposition to the trade unions put up by the Belgian unions and French Proudhonists at the Geneva and Lausanne congresses of the International.
The Geneva Congress, the first congress of the International Working Men's Association, was held on 3-8 September 1866.
It was attended by 60 delegates from the Central Council (see Note 73), various sections of the Interna­ tional and workers' associations in Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland.
Hermann Jung was elected its chairman.
The Congress approved the Rules and Administrative Regulations of the International Working Men's Asso­ ciation (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
441).
Marx's 'Instructions for the Delegates of the Provisional General Council.
The Different Questions' were read as the official report of the Central Council (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
185).
The Congress became a scene of struggle between Marx's followers and the Proudhonists, who had a third of the votes and countered the 'Instructions' with their own programme on all items on the agenda.
They were particularly opposed to trade unions and preached political indifferen-tism.
In heated debates with the Proudhonists, Jung, Eccarius, Dupont, Carter and other supporters of the Central Council succeeded in having 6 items out of 9 of the 'Instructions' adopted in the form of Congress resolutions, including the one on trade unions.
The Lausanne Congress of the International was held on 2-8 September 1867.
Marx took part in the preparations, but, as he was busy reading the proofs of Volume One of Capital, he was unable to attend.
He withdrew his candidature at the General Council meeting of 13 August 1867.
The Congress was attended by 64 delegates from six countries (Britain, France, Germany, 586 Notes Switzerland, Belgium and Italy).
Apart from the annual report of the General Council, the Congress heard reports from the local sections, which indicated the increased influence of the International on the proletarian masses and the growing strength of its organisations in different countries.
Despite the efforts of the General Council's delegates, the Proudhonist-minded delegates imposed their agenda on the Congress.
They sought to revise the decisions of the Geneva Congress in a Proudhonist spirit.
They managed to pass a number of their resolutions, including the ones on cooperation and credit, which they regarded as the chief factors of changing a society through reform.
However, they failed to achieve their main objective.
The Congress confirmed the Geneva resolutions on the economic struggle and strikes.
The Proudhonists likewise failed to seize the leadership of the International.
The Congress re-elected the General Council in its former composition and retained London as its seat.
—95, 221, 258 Marx sent Sorge's credentials to Meyer (see this volume, p.
59) in response to Meyer's letter of 20 May 1868, which contained the following request: 'In the middle of next month, Sorge is planning to go to Chicago and will be able to establish all sorts of contacts.
Would you be so kind as to supply us with some useful addresses?'—96 As President of the Central Committee of the Social Party of New York and its environs, (between November 1867 and September 1868), the first workers' party in the USA, Friedrich Sorge was a vigorous promoter of the ideas of the International in the USA.
Early in 1868, disagreements of principle began to arise, which later turned into a personal hostility between Sorge on the one hand, and Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt on the other.
Meyer and Vogt insisted on more vigorous action to draw the unions of American workers into the International, even though they were not yet ready to take that step.
Sorge strove to organise a more active popularisation campaign that would gradually make them realise the need for joining the International.
In the end he failed to achieve the official affiliation of the Social Party to the International, but in his activity he adhered to the International's principles and the decisions of its congresses.
Having been stripped, on Meyer's and Vogt's insistence, of the General Council's Corresponding Secretary's powers, Sorge did not belong to any organisation for over a year.
Only in December 1869, he resumed his work of popularising the International's ideas among the German workers within the reorganised General Association of German Workers.
— 97 The National Labor Union was founded in the USA at a congress in Baltimore in 1866, with the active participation of William Sylvis, a prominent member of the American labour movement.
It made a major contribution to the growing struggle for an independent policy of workers' associations, for solidarity of white and coloured workers, for an 8-hour working day and for the rights of working women.
Soon after its foundation, it established contacts with the International Working Men's Association.
The Union's congress in Chicago held in August 1867 elected Richard Trevellick delegate to the Lausanne Congress of the International, but he was unable to attend.
At the last sessions of the Basle Congress of the International (1869) Andrew Cameron was the National Labor Union delegate.
The Union's congress in Cincinnati in August 1870 adopted a resolution on its adherence to the principles of the International and its intention to join it.
The resolution was not implemented, however.
In 1870 and 1871, many trade unions withdrew, and in 1872 the Union virtually ceased to exist.
— 97, 184, 351 Notes 587 '47 Marx planned to have Capital translated into English back in 1865, when working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels, 31 July 1865; present edition, Vol.
42).
Reporter Peter Fox, a member of the British labour movement, was to help him find a publisher.
However, due to the latter's death in 1869 nothing was settled.
The English translation of Volume One of Capital edited by Engels appeared after Marx's death, in January 1887.
The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886; Eleanor Marx-Aveling assisted in preparing the translation for the press.

—97 150 At the Brussels Congress of the International (see Note 138), on 11 September 1868, a group of German delegates moved the following resolution on Marx's Capital: 'We, the German delegates at the International Working Men's Congress at Brussels, recommend to the working men of all countries the work of Carl Marx, Das Kapital, published last year, and urge upon them the desirability of endeavouring to cause that important work to be translated into those languages into which it has not yet been translated, and declare that Carl Marx has the inestimable merit of being the first political economist who has scientifically analysed capital and dissolved it into its component parts.
' The resolution was unanimously approved by the Congress and published in The Times on 15 September 1868 as part of Eccarius's report.

The article 'Der fünfte Vereinstag deutscher Arbeitervereine zu Nürnberg (5-7.

In connection with land ownership, the Congress emphasised that the contemporary economic development of the capitalist system determines the need for introducing public ownership of land and the mineral resources, including arable land (for the text of the resolution, see: 'Troisième congrès de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs.

—101, 106 154 Lessner, who informed Marx almost daily about the course of the Brussels Congress, wrote in a letter of 11 September 1868: 'On Wednesday, the question of machinery was discussed.
I took the floor, mentioned your book and quoted from it.
.
.
Daily News had something about this.
Its reporter approached me and inquired about the name of the book and the part from which I quoted.

Friend Eccarius, however, did not deem it worthwhile, or not to his advantage, to mention this in his report for The Times'—101 '55 The text of the resolution on war proposed by a group of German delegates at the Brussels Congress was printed in full in the supplement to Le Peuple belge, 22 September 1868, and the Vorbote magazine, No.

— 101 156 The Brussels Congress of the International Working Men's Association elected a special commission to investigate the accusations brought by Vésinier against certain members of the International (see notes 74 and 90).
On 3 November 1868, at the sitting of the General Council, a letter from the Brussels commission was read out which said that Vésinier had failed to adduce any proof and that the commission had not been able to find the slightest grounds for these accusations.
The commission members proposed expelling Vésinier from the International as a slanderer.
—102 157 A reference to an article by Johann Philipp Becker 'Was wir wollen und sollen' printed in 1866 in the first issue of the Vorbote.
Before the Nuremberg Congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations, this article appeared, mistakenly, in the Union organ, Deutsche Arbeiterhalle on 27 July and 12 August 1868, as the International's programme, and was reprinted by the Demok­ ratisches Wochenblatt (nos.
31-32, supplements, and 33, 1, 8 and 15 August 1868).
It gave an incoherent and vague account of the aims and tasks of the International working-class movement, especially in Germany and Switzerland.
However, it was not mentioned at the Nuremberg Congress, as the error had been rectified earlier.
The Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
35, 29 August, published the chief points of the International's programme which the Congress adopted without any changes.
Delegates Stuttman, Eichelsdörfer and Sonnemann stated that the reference to Becker's article as the International's programme was an error.
In a letter to Marx of 20 September 1868, Liebknecht wrote: 'The quiproquo happened while I was absent on my wedding trip.
I had given orders to print your "Address"; and Bebel, who could not find it, wrote to Becker for the "Programme" and received the unfortunate document that brought us to despair in Nuremberg.
When I discovered the mistake, it was too late to mend it, especially as we could not well disavow old Becker.
Luckily, Pfeiffer and Co.
were so confused by our vigorous onslaught that they quite forgot to prove the stupidities of the pseudo-programme.
Now the thing is explained, and our people know, that under the circumstances the error was excusable.
'—102 '58 In the summer of 1869, the Ermen-Engels partnership agreement signed on 30 June 1864 for the term of 5 years, which had made Engels a co-owner of the firm of Ermen and Engels in Manchester, was to expire.
As Engels had Notes 589 expected, his talks with G.
Ermen about his withdrawal from the firm became protracted.
A draft agreement is extant, drawn up by Engels on 2 December 1868, which specified the terms of the withdrawal: '1) Mr.
Engels retires from business on the 30th June 1869 and engages not to be interested, either directly or indirectly, as principal or assistant, in any similar or competing business either in England or on the Continent for the term of five years after that date.

—104 In a letter of 15 September 1868, Schweitzer wrote to Marx: 'I consider you to be the head of the European working-class movement — not only through democratic election but by the will of God.
You can also be assured that I will promote your intentions as best I can.
Of course no prestige is great enough to prevent one, under certain circumstances, from adhering to one's own opinion.
I believe, however, that conflict does not arise easily.
When it appeared to me that you were not right, subsequent consideration showed me, at least until now, that I was mistaken myself.
Yet I cannot find much in common with your followers—at least with some of them.
'.

I intend to get you the Statutes which we want to propose to the organisation at the congress after they have been discussed by a limited number of persons, so that before the congress, has started you will have a chance to note the points which may not tally with the spirit of the [congress's] organisation, although this shouldn't occur.
'It may happen that it will be too late to send the Statutes to you; however, I shall try to make the dispatch possible.
'—105, 107, 115, 118, 127, 132, Marx is referring to the six editorials printed under the common heading 'Der allgemeine deutsche Arbeiter-Congress' in Der Social-Demokrat in September 1868, which mirrored the ideological conflict between dedicated Lassalleans and the followers of Schweitzer.
Fearing that their influence among the workers might dwindle under the impact of the mounting strike movement and the International's ideas, Schweitzer's followers were forced to abandon some of the Lassallean concepts and change their attitude towards the economic struggle of the working class.
Specifically, a general German workers' congress in Berlin that Schweitzer and Fritzsche had been planning (see Note 164) was to consider the issues of the strike movement and the trade unions of German workers.
The address drawn up by Schweitzer and Fritzsche for the congress and published by Der Social-Demokrat, No.
101, 30 August 1868, read: 'It is urgently necessary to establish a mass and stable organisation of all workers throughout Germany for the purpose of jointly moving forward by means of strikes.
.
.
We are convening a general German workers' congress to set up, and also strengthen and evolve the uniform organisational principles of general trade unions in all industries throughout Germany, as well as to discuss the general lines along which strikes can be organised.
'—105 590 Notes 162 xhe principle of setting up production associations on the basis of state credit as a means of emancipating the workers from exploitation was first proclaimed by Philippe Bûchez in 1831 in the philosophical journal L'Européen, which he published.
His plan was popularised in the 1840s by L'Atelier magazine, which represented the interests and ideas of French handicraftsmen and workers influenced by the doctrine of Christian socialism (see also this volume, p.
260).
—105, 133, 260 163 Marx's letter to Liebknecht has not been found.
In his reply of 20 September 1868, Liebknecht wrote that '.

there are a few dozen of "Vogts" in Berlin.
I had to leave them there when I was expelled; and most copies were distributed by me to political persons,—sold very few.
In 5 or 6 days I hope to have news'.
—106 164 A reference to the general congress of the General Association of German Workers convened by Schweitzer and Fritzsche on 26-29 September 1868 in Berlin with the permission of the Hamburg Congress of the Lassallean Association to discuss the establishment of trade unions (see Note 104).
Represented at the congress were mostly workers from North German towns.
The workers' societies comprising the Nuremberg organisation headed by Bebel and Liebknecht were refused permission to send their members to the congress.
As a result the Berlin congress promoted the foundation of a number of unions built after the pattern of the sectarian Lassallean Association and brought them together in a single general union.
Schweitzer became president, while the most prominent members of the General Association of German Workers headed the individual, and for the most part newly-established, unions.
Marx sharply criticised Schweitzer for such an organisation of the congress, which brought about a split in the German trade unions (see this volume, pp.
134, 135), and for the adoption of the Statutes, which went completely against the goals and nature of the trade-union movement.
—108, 112, 118, 125, 127, 132, 133, 134, 140 165 A reference to the bourgeois revolution in Spain (1868-74) which began on 18 September 1868 with a naval mutiny in Cadiz against the reactionary monarchy of Isabella II.
The masses, supported by almost all the royal troops, were actively involved in the revolution.
As a result, state authority passed to the bourgeoisie and bourgeois landowners, who on 18 October formed a provisional government headed by General Francisco Serrano.
The Constituent Cortes, convened in February 1869, passed a bourgeois-monarchist constitution which proclaimed Spain a hereditary monarchy and introduced a number of bourgeois freedoms (universal suffrage for men, freedom of press, assembly, associations, etc.
).
Against the background of fierce class clashes, a bourgeois-democratic federative republic was proclaimed in Spain in 1873.
However, in 1874, big bourgeoisie and landowners engineered a restoration of the Bourbons.
—108, 113, 115, 119, 126, 131, 137 166 In a letter to Marx of 16 September 1868, Liebknecht proposed that an address to the German workers be drawn up urging unification and criticising Schweitzer and his followers as opponents of unity in the ranks of Social-Democrats.
—109, 110, 112 167 A reference to the ban imposed on 16 September 1868 by the Leipzig police on the General Association of German Workers (see Note 104) centred in Leipzig, and on its local branch in Berlin (see Engels' article 'On the Dissolution of the Lassallean Workers' Association', present edition, Vol.
21).
On 10 October, Notes 591 however, a group of Lassalleans headed by Schweitzer restored the association under the same name, transferring its seat to Berlin.
The new Statutes of the Association published in Der Social-Demokrat, No.
119, 11 October 1868, stated that the Association would abide by Prussian laws and act only in a peaceful, legal way.
Adapting itself to Prussian law, the Association dissolved its local branches.
(For Marx's and Engels' opinion of these manoeuvres, see letters of Marx to Engels of 25, 26 and 29 September and of Engels to Marx of 21, 24 and 30 September and 2 October, as well as Marx's letter to Schweitzer of 13 October 1868.
)—109, 111, 134, 140 168 The bourgeois revolution of 1848 in the Kingdom of Naples began on 12 January 1848 with a popular uprising in Sicily against the feudal absolutist monarchy of Ferdinand II of the Bourbon dynasty.
It triggered off revolutio­ nary events in other Italian states.
However, as a result of the conciliatory stand of the liberal bourgeoisie, the revolution was suppressed in May 1849.
—109 169 Engels is referring to the Union of German Workers' Associations, which was set up at the workers' educational societies' congress in Frankfurt am Main on 7 June 1863, in opposition to the Lassallean General Association of German Workers (see Note 104).
Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel were actively involved in its activities, heading the workers' movement for a revolutionary and democratic way of Germany's unification and against the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie, which was quite strong in the first years of the Union's existence.
At the Nuremberg Congress (see Note 135), it in fact affiliated itself with the International.
Later, the Union was instrumental in the formation, at the Eisenach Congress of 1869, of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (see Note 373).
—110, 118 170 In late September 1868, Engels wrote an article 'On the Dissolution of the Lassallean Workers' Association' for the Demokratisches Wochenblatt published by Liebknecht (present edition, Vol.
21).
In it he quoted excerpts from his pamphlet 'The Prussian Military Question and the German Workers' Party' (present edition, Vol.
20).
—Ill, 112, 114 171 A reference to a speech made by Bernhard Becker, President of the Lassallean General Association of German Workers, at the meeting of its Hamburg branch on 22 March 1865, in which he slandered the International Working Men's Association and Marx, Engels and Liebknecht personally.
Becker's speech appeared in the supplement of Der Social-Demokrat, No.
39, 26 March 1865.
Marx exposed Becker's lies in his essay 'The "President of Mankind'" (present edition, Vol.

—114, 127, 188, 191, 195, 262, 349, 428, 462, 471 175 A reference to the agreement reached by British trade unions at the first national congress in 1868, which was convened in connection with the campaign for completely legalising them.
Ever since, congresses have been held 592 Notes on a regular basis, and an executive body of the congress, the Parliamentary committee heading the campaign, was formed.
The London Trades Council was first elected at a conference of trade union delegates held in London in May 1860.
It headed the London trade unions numbering thousands of members and was fairly influential among the British workers.
The leaders of the following trade unions played a major role in the Council: the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (Robert Ap-plegarth), the Shoemakers' Society (George Odger), the Operative Bricklayers' Society (Edwin Coulson and George Howell) and the Amalgamated Engineers (William Allan).
All of them, except Allan, were members of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association.
The General Council did its best to draw the broad mass of British workers into the International and endeavoured, on the one hand, to get the local trade union organisations affiliated to it and, on the other, to induce the London Trades Council to join the International as a British Section.
After the repeated deferment of the question, which was due to the struggle between the reformer leaders of the London Council who opposed affiliation and local trade union representatives, it was finally decided at the London Trades Council meetings of 9 and 14 January 1867, to co-operate with the International Association 'for the furtherance of all questions affecting the interests of labour; at the same time continuing the London Trades Council as a distinct and independent body as before' (The Times, No.
25708, 15 January 1867).
This decision was discussed at the General Council sitting of 15 January 1867.
Afterwards, the contacts between the London Trades Council and the International were maintained through the General Council members who also sat on the Trades Council.
The London Workingmen's Association was founded in 1866 on the initiative of George Potter and his followers for the purpose of launching a movement for trade union representation in Parliament.
From the start, Potter's platform was of a conciliatory character; he and his followers made advances to the workers and professed themselves champions of universal suffrage, but in fact were ready to compromise and accept the election reform on any terms.
The work of Potter's association was in fact hampering the movement for universal suffrage, headed by the Reform League (see Note 228), whose programme and tactics had been evolved under Marx's influence.
The association functioned up to the 1870s.
By the Amalgamated Trades Unions here is meant the United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades set up in June 1866 at the conference of trade union delegates in Sheffield.
The Alliance, which embraced 53 trade unions with the membership of nearly 60,000, existed up to late 1870.

—116, 118 177 Marx is referring to the speech made by the leader of the Party of Progress Schulze-Delitzsch at the meeting of members of the machine-builders' union in Berlin on 24 September 1868.
The meeting elected twelve delegates to the general congress of the General Association of German Workers (see Note 164).
A detailed report of the meeting and Schulze-Delitzsch's speech were published in Der Social-Demokrat, No.
113, 27 September 1868.
—116 178 A reference to the conflict in the Paris Section of the International which was discussed at the General Council sittings on 24 January, 7, 21 and 28 February, and 7 and 14 March 1865.
This was the first occasion when the General Council acted as arbiter in a section's internal affairs.
Notes 593 The Paris Section, which was founded at a meeting held on 28 September 1864 at St.
Martin's Hall, where the International had been inaugurated, began its work in late December 1864.
It was headed by an Administration comprising three correspondents approved in London, Proudhonist workers Henri Tolain, Fribourg and Charles Limousin.
Alongside with Tolain's group, a lawyer and bourgeois republican Henri Lefort also claimed to be a founder and leader of the International Working Men's Association in France.
Lefort's followers accused Tolain and other members of the Paris Administration of being in contact with the Bonapartists (Marx and Engels exposed this insinuation in the statement to Der Social-Demokrat, see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
36).
Neverthe­ less, wishing to draw into the International the workers grouped around Lefort and trying to reduce his influence on them, Marx supported the Central Council resolution of 7 February 1865 on Lefort's appointment as 'Counsel for the literary defence' of the International in France.
Those present at the meeting of the Paris Section, however, lodged a protest against this decision, and sent Tolain and Fribourg to London on 28 February to speak on this point at the Central Council meeting.
The Council referred the problem to the Standing Committee, which discussed it on 4 and 6 March.
Marx proposed a draft resolution which actually annulled the previously adopted decision on Lefort's appointment.
This resolution has survived in his notebook (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
330).
When Marx drew it up, he tried to protect the French organisation of the International from attacks by bourgeois elements and to strengthen the leadership of the Paris Section by bringing in revolutionary proletarians.
The draft formed the basis for the Central Council resolution on this issue which was passed on 7 March 1865 (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
82).

The work was published for the first time in Hamburg in 1869.
—120, 126, 151, 152, 154, 173 594 Notes 186 Marx is referring to a letter written to him by Nikolai Danielson on 30 (18) September 1868, with a postscript by Nikolai Lyubavin dated 14 (2) October.
Danielson wrote: 'The significance of your latest work—Capital.
Critique of Political Economy—has prompted one of local publishers (N.
Polyakov) to undertake its translation into Russian.
The various attendant circumstances make it desirable to publish the second volume simultaneously with the first.
Therefore, as the publisher's representative, I request you, should you consider it possible, to send me sheets of the second volume as soon as they have been published.
' In his reply, Marx enclosed a note on his own literary and political activities, which was used in the preface to Capital's Russian edition (see this volume, pp.
123-25 and Note 196).
—120, 123, 149 18' At the time, Marx planned to publish the second and third books of Capital ('The Process of Circulation of Capital' and 'The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole') as Volume Two of Capital (see also Note 41).
—123, 160, 412 188 The notes about Marx's literary and political work were used in the Preface to the Russian edition of Volume One of Capital which appeared in St.
Peters­ burg in the spring of 1872.
(On the history of its translation into Russian, see Note 196.
)—123 189 In the original Marx wrote '1847' instead of '1848' .
The matter is that the basis of this 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade' was the material prepared by Marx for a speech he was to have delivered at the International Congress of Economists in Brussels in September 1847 (see present edition, Vol.
6, pp.
279-81 and 287-90 and also notes 116 and 246).
The speech was published as a pamphlet in French at the end of January 1848.
—124 190 Marx is referring to a series of articles by Engels 'The Armies of Europe' (present edition, Vol.
14) published in Putnam's Monthly.
A Magazine of Literature, Science, and Art in August, September and December 1855 through Marx's mediation (see Marx's letter to Engels of 15 June 1855, present edition, Vol.
39).
Marx helped Engels by collecting data on various European armies, the Spanish and the Neapolitan in particular, at the British Museum Library.
— 124 191 In Britain, the different workers' societies functioning within the same industry were admitted to the International on equal terms.
—125 192 In his letter of 8 October 1868 Johann Baptist Schweitzer complained to Marx as the 'secretary of the International' about the policies pursued by Bebel, Liebknecht and their followers towards the General Association of German Workers which he headed.
He mentioned the decision of the Hamburg Congress (see Note 104) to become affiliated, 'with the consent of the authorities', with the International Working Men's Association.
Schweitzer demanded that Marx support him and help him check Bebel's and Liebknecht's attacks against him.
Otherwise, Schweitzer threatened, he would begin 'open hostilities'.
Enclosed with his letter were the Statutes of the general Trade Union Association founded at the general congress of the General Association of German Workers in Berlin (see Note 164).
—127 193 xhe decision to abolish the office of the General Council's President was moved on Marx's initiative by John Hales and adopted at the General Council meeting Notes 595 of 24 September 1867.
(See Marx's letter to Engels, 4 October 1867: present edition, Vol.
42.
) The abolition of this post, which had been permanently held since 1864 by one of the British trade union leaders, George Odger, considerably weakened the position of the reformist wing of the International.
Odger did not get any post when the appointment of officers in the Council took place.
The International's Basle Congress (September 1869) approved the General Council's decision.
—128, 135 194 The address written by Marx on instructions from the General Council and approved by the Council on 13 October 1868, is not extant.
—128 195 After Volume One of Capital had been published, Kugelmann and Engels took considerable trouble to blow up the conspiracy of silence of bourgeois science and the bourgeois press against this work.
Kugelmann's connections made it possible to distribute the book and popularise it in the democratic and bourgeois press.
He managed to get published anonymously a number of reviews by Engels in the Beobachter, Staats-Anzeiger für Württemberg and other newspapers.
—130 196 A reference to the publication of the Russian translation of Volume One of Capital, which was undertaken by the St.
Petersburg publisher N.
Polvakov; on 30 (18) September 1868, Danielson wrote to Marx on his behalf (see this volume, pp.
123-25).
At the end of 1869 it was decided that the translation would be made by Bakunin.
However, the specimens he submitted were not accepted as satisfactory.
Starting with the summer of 1870, the translation was being done by Lopatin, who used his stay in London to consult Marx.
He translated chapters II, III and IV (in part) of the first German edition of Volume One.
Late in 1870, with the translation still unfinished, Lopatin returned to Russia to help organise Chernyshevsky's escape from Siberia.
By October 1871, the translation was finished by Danielson (he completed Chapter IV, and did chapters V and VI) and Lyubavin, a former fellow-student of Danielson, professor of chemistry at Moscow University (he translated Chapter I and the supplement).
The first Russian edition of Volume One of Capital, which was also the first foreign edition, appeared in St.
Petersburg on 8 April (27 March) 1872.

Bienne, le 1 er Sept.
1868, signed on behalf of the Association by Marie Goegg, President of the Central Committee.
The Address made it clear that the Association, which had by that time existed for about three months, was a feminist organisation which showed no interest in the issue of class struggle.
It demanded that suffrage be extended to women, and advocated their equal rights to work and education.
Its further history is unknown.
—131 199 An excerpt from this letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence, 1846-1895, London, Lawrence LTD [1934]; a more complete version was published in: Marx, Engels, Selected Correspondence, Moscow, Progress Publishers, 1975.
—132 200 Schulze-Delitzsch, a German bourgeois economist and a leader of the Party of Progress (see Note 317), advocated small savings banks and loan offices, and consumer and producer cooperatives based on the workers' own means with the aim of diverting the workers from the revolutionary struggle against 596 Notes capital.
Schulze-Delitzsch advocated harmony of capitalists' and workers' interests, asserting that cooperatives could help improve workers' conditions under capitalism and save small producers and artisans from ruin.
Lassalle criticised Schulze-Delitzsch's cooperative plans and advanced his own idea of production associations set up by workers and sponsored by the Junker-bourgeois Prussian state.
—133 201 A reference to a demand advanced by the Chartist movement in Britain which was entered into the People's Charter published on 8 May 1838 in the form of a Bill to be submitted to Parliament.
It consists of six clauses: universal suffrage (for men over 21 years of age), annual elections to Parliament, secret ballot, equal constituencies, abolition of property qualifications for candidates to Parliament, and salaries for M.
P.
s.
In 1839, 1842 and 1848 petitions for the Charter were rejected by Parliament.
—133 202 Marx is referring to the new Regulations for handicraft trades, which extended the workers' right to form coalitions and stage strikes.
On 29 May 1869 the Regulations were approved by the North German Reichstag (see also Note 324).
—134 203 Between 14 and 22 September 1868, 13,000 miners were on strike in Essen.
They demanded that deductions from wages be stopped and an eight-hour working day introduced.
The strike ended in victory for the workers.
—136 204 A reference to the distribution of Marx's book The Poverty of Philosophy.

.
(see present edition, Vol.
6), which was written in 1847 in Brussels and published (1,500 copies) that same year by two publishers simultaneously, Vogler's in Brussels and Frank's in Paris, who in 1865 sold his business to publisher F.
Vieweg.
The publication was undertaken on a commission basis: Marx paid part of the expenses as the author and was to receive a certain sum from the sale of each copy.
By 1868, the demand for the book grew steeply owing to the mounting campaign against the Proudhonist elements in the International, while the book became a bibliographical rarity.
In view of this, Marx applied, in October 1868, to the Paris publisher, who, as is clear from the letter, had stopped the sales altogether.
Nothing is known about the results of Lafargue's negotiations on this issue.
—137, 217 205 Alexandre Besson and Victor Le Lubez (see Note 72) had sent a letter to Hermann Jung in October 1868 in which they protested against the decision of the Brussels Congress to expel Pierre Vésinier from the International (see Note 156).
In their letter they also attacked Hermann Jung and Eugène Dupont, members of the General Council.
On 19 October 1868, Jung informed Marx about the French Section's meeting at which he was going to defend the International.
—139 206 A reference to the reactionary Prussian Law on Associations passed on 11 March 1850.
—140 207 Engels is referring to the Democratic Labour Union (Der Demokratische Arbeiterverein) that was formed in October 1868 following a split in the Berlin Workers' Union, which rejected, by 32 votes against 28, the resolutions of the Nuremberg Congress (see Note 135).
A leading role in the founding of the new Union belonged to Eichhoff, who kept in constant touch with Marx and was the Berlin correspondent of the General Council of the First International.
On 3 November 1868, at a General Council meeting, Marx reported on the formation of the Democratic Labour Union.
On Eichhoff's suggestion, the Union joined the Union of German Workers' Associations headed by Bebel and Notes 597 Liebknecht, and adopted its programme based on the International's principles.
The Democratic Labour Union also maintained close contacts with the Berlin Section of the International.
Almost all of its members were also members of the International.
To emphasise its proletarian character, two workers, Wilcke and Kämmerer, were elected its Presidents.
The Democratic Labour Union actively opposed the Lassalleans.
Wilhelm Liebknecht used to speak at its meetings.
In 1869 it joined the Social-Democratic Workers' Party set up at the Eisenach Congress.
—140 208 A reference to Chapter VI, 'Der Accumulationsprozess des Kapitals' of the first German edition of Capital's Volume One (1867).
Corresponding to it in the second and subsequent German editions is Part VII.
In the English edition of 1887 which was prepared by Engels this is Part VII ('The Accumulation of Capital') and Part VIII ('The So-Called Primitive Accumulation') (see present edition, Vol.
35).
—141 209 In his letter to Marx of 15 October 1868 Kugelmann wrote about a review of Capital by Hansen, a Berlin professor of political economy, who said, among other things, that it was 'the most significant phenomenon of this century'.
Hansen also offered Marx a professorship in political economy.
—142, 144 210 A reference to a meeting held on 20 October 1868.
It was organised by the French Section in London (see Note 72).
It was held mainly by petty-bour­ geois refugees headed by Pyat, who had lost contact with the International.
They came out against the resolution on the bourgeois pacifist League of Peace and Freedom (see Note 271) passed by the Brussels Congress on 12 September 1868.
It stated that the existence of a pacifist league claiming to be the leader of the international workers' movement is superfluous given the existence of the International Working Men's Association.
It was suggested that the League should join the International and its members should become members of International's sections.
On 20 October Marx wrote to the General Council about the forthcoming meeting.
The Council referred the issue for consideration to its executive body, the Sub-Committee, granting it special powers for exposing the intentions of the meeting's organisers should this prove necessary.
—143 211 Probably a reference to the strike of British tailors which began in March 1866.
It was headed by the Executive Committee of the Journeymen Tailors' Protective Association formed at the national conference of British tailors held in Manchester on 12-17 March 1866.
London entrepreneurs tried to recruit apprentices in Belgium, France and Switzerland through their agents.
In this connection, the General Council published an appeal in these coun­ tries' newspapers urging the tailors to refuse to go to England on account of the strike under way there.
The entrepreneurs' plans were foiled, and they were obliged to make concessions and raise the wages.
—143 2'2 A reference to Kugelmann's letter to Marx of 24 October 1868.
—144 213 This letter has come down to us as a copy written in English in Sigfrid Mever's hand.
—147 214 The General Council's credentials for August Vogt, which Marx enclosed with his letter to Meyer and Vogt of 28 October 1868, are published according to the copy made by Sigfrid Meyer on the copy of Marx's letter to Jessup of 28 October 1868.
—148 215 In his letters to Marx of 31 October and 31 October-1 November 1868, Eichhoff cleared himself of the charge of being connected with the Prussian 598 Notes police (see Note 61).
Among the reasons that had led to this suspicion was an inaccurate report of Eichhoff's speech at the first meeting of the Berlin Democratic Labour Union (see Note 207) on 15 October 1868 published by Die Zukunft and later by the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
43, 24 October 1868.
—151, 152 216 A reference to the 'Adresse an die Demokraten Spaniens' (Address to the Democrats of Spain) issued in October 1868 on behalf of the Social-Democrats of Saxony in connection with the revolution in Spain (see Note 165).
The Address was published in the supplement to the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, edited by Liebknecht, No.
44, 31 October 1868.
—151 217 An allusion to the June 1848 uprising of Paris workers which ended in the defeat of the insurgents, and at the coup d'état accomplished in France on 2 December 1851, which established the military bourgeois dictatorship of Louis Napoleon.
On 2 December 1852, the Empire was proclaimed, and Louis Bonaparte became Emperor Napoleon III.
—152, 242 218 A reference to the 'Adresse au peuple et au Congrès des États-Unis d'Ame'rique' (Address to the People and Congress of the United States of America) which was read on 2 November 1868 at a meeting convened in London by petty-bourgeois democrats Felix Pyat, Victor Le Lubez, J.

—156 221 The meeting convened in Paris on 10 October 1868 by French economists and journalists, including Horn, was devoted to the problem 'capital and interest from the point of view of labour'.
A report of the meeting was published by Le Figaro, No.
285, 11 October 1868, under the heading 'Chronique de Paris'.
— 158 222 A reference to the subscription launched by the democratic and republican Paris press to raise money for a monument to Victor Baudin, deputy of the Legislative Assembly, who died on the barricades during the Bonapartist coup of 2 December 1851.
Against the background of mounting anti-Bonapartist sentiments, the subscription assumed the nature of a mass political campaign.
Its organisers had legal proceedings instituted against them on the charge of inciting hatred against the government.
The trial took place on 13-14 November 1868.
The accounts were published in pamphlet form under the heading 'Affaire de la souscription Baudin (The affair of Baudin's subscription) in Paris, in 1868.
The monument was unveiled only in 1872.
The banquet movement—a campaign for an electoral reform in France in 1847, on the eve of the revolution.
Bourgeois-democratic elements took an active part in it alongside the bourgeois liberals.
Engels gave his opinion of this movement in a number of articles (see present edition, Vol.
6, pp.
364-66, 375-82, 385-87, 393-401, 409-11, 438-44).
—159, 188, 191 Notes 599 223 -phe Bank Charter Act (An Act to Regulate the Issue of Bank-Notes, and for Giving to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England Certain Privileges for a Limited Period) was introduced by Robert Peel on 19 July 1844.
It provided for the division of the Bank of England into two separate departments, each with its own cash account—the Banking Department, dealing exclusively with credit operations, and the Issue Department issuing bank-notes.
The Act limited the quantity of bank-notes in circulation and guaranteed them with definite gold and silver reserves, which could not be used for the credit operations of the Banking Department.
Further issues of bank-notes were allowed only in the event of a corresponding increase in the precious metal reserves.
The issue of bank-notes by provincial banks was stopped.
The Act was suspended several times by the government itself, in particular, during the economic crises of 1847, 1857 and 1866.
Marx gave an analysis of the meaning and significance of the 1844 Act in a series of articles written in 1857-58 for the New-York Daily Tribune: 'The Vienna Note.
— The United States and Europe.
— Letters from Shumla.
—Peel's Bank Act' (see present edition, Vol.
12), 'The Bank Act of 1844 and the Monetary Crises in England', 'The British Revulsion' (Vol.

16), etc.
A detailed description of the Act was given by Marx in Capital, Vol.
Ill (Chapter XXXIV) (Vol.
37).
—159, 166 224 Marx is referring to the Chapter 'Spaltung von Profit in Zins und industriellen Profit.
Das zinstragende Kapital' of his manuscript of Book Three of Capital written in 1864-65.
In Volume Three of Capital published by Engels in 1894 it corresponds to the entire Part V 'Division of Profit into Interest and Profit of Enterprise.
Interest-Bearing Capital' (see present edition, Vol.
37).
—160 225 A reference to the confidential address of the Permanent Central Committee Bureau of the League of Peace and Freedom (see Note 271) of 22 September 1868.
It was published as a leaflet signed by Gustav Vogt, the President of the Bureau and Editor-in-Chief of the League's press organ, Les États-Unis d'Europe.
The address called on the League 'to become a pure political expression of great economic and social interests and principles which are now developed and spread so triumphantly by the great International Working Men's Association of Europe and America' (see also K.
Marx, F.
Engels, The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men's Association, present edition, Vol.
23.
).
—161 226 The decision to publish the resolutions of the Geneva and Brussels congresses was adopted by the General Council on 6 October 1868 on a suggestion by Lafargue and Dupont.
The preparatory work was done by Eccarius, while Marx put the finishing touches and checked the translation into English.
The first part of the pamphlet was published in The Bee-Hive, No.
371, 21 November and the second, in No.
374 on 12 December 1868.
In February 1869 the resolutions were published in London in pamphlet form, under the heading: 'The International Working Men's Association.
Resolutions of the Congress of Geneva, 1866, and Congress of Brussels, 1868'.
—161, 221, 223 227 A reference to the bankruptcy of Overend, Gurney and Company, a major British bank.
It financially ruined a large number of depositors.
The matter was brought to court; the trial ended in December 1869 with the acquittal of the company directors.
—161, 208, 305, 548 228 The Reform League was founded in London in the spring of 1865 on the initiative and with the direct participation of the International's General 600 Notes Council as a political centre of the mass movement for the second election reform.
The League's leading bodies—the Council and Executive Committee— included the General Council members, mainly trade-union leaders.
The League's programme was drafted under the influence of Marx, who called upon the working-classes to pursue their policy independently of bourgeois parties.
Unlike these parties, which confined their demands to household suffrage, the League advanced the demand for manhood suffrage.
This revived Chartist slogan (see Note 201) evoked a sympathetic response among the working class and won the League the support of the trade unions, hitherto indifferent to politics.
The League had branches in all major industrial towns and counties.
However, the vacillations of the bourgeois radicals in its leadership, and the conciliation of the trade union leaders prevented the League from following the line chartered by the General Council.
The British bourgeoisie succeeded in splitting the movement, and a moderate reform was carried out in 1867 which granted franchise only to the petty bourgeoisie and the upper layer of the working class (see Note 3).

154, 156, 479).
—162 2S2 Rotten boroughs—sparsely populated or depopulated small towns and villages in England which enjoyed the right to send representatives to Parliament since the Middle Ages.
These representatives were in fact appointed by the landed aristocracy, who controlled the handful of 'free voters' who nominally elected them.
The 'rotten boroughs' were disfranchised by the electoral reforms of 1832, 1867 and 1884.
—163 233 The Mobile Guard was set up by a decree of the Provisional Government on 25 February 1848 with the secret aim of fighting the insurgent people.
Its armed units consisted mainly of lumpen-proletarians and were used to crush the June uprising of the Paris workers.
Subsequently, it was disbanded on the insistence of the Bonapartists, who feared that in the event of a conflict between President Bonaparte and the republicans the Mobile Guard would side with the latter.
For Marx's description of the Mobile Guard, see his work The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 (present edition, Vol.
10, pp.
62-63).
—164 234 Marx's article for The Diplomatic Review was written on request of Collet Dobson Collet, the publisher, on 9 November 1868 (see this volume, p.
159), and published under the heading 'How Mr.
Gladstone's Bank Letter of 1866 Procured a Loan of Six Millions for Russia'(see present edition, Vol.
21).
The editors of The Diplomatic Review prefaced it with a note which introduced Marx as the author of Capital and the Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century (see present edition, vols.
35 and 15).
—166 235 The National Sunday League—a philanthropic educational organisation which campaigned to get the cultural establishments—museums, concert halls, etc.
—to stay open on Sundays, since the working population was unable to visit them on weekdays.
Its honorary secretary was R.
M.
Morell, and a member of the council—the bourgeois radical Baxter Langley.
The League's activities met with a strong opposition from the Anglican Church and the religious organisations which demanded a strict observance of Sundays.
The League's premises at 256, High Holborn, London, W.
C.
were the venue of the General Council meetings held between June 1868 and February 1872.
—166 236 A reference to the anonymous article 'Look before You Leap, and Beware of Traitors' (Reynolds's Newspaper, No.
949, 18 October 1868), which sharply criticised Jones' attitude to the Whigs and accused him of being a renegade.
During the Parliamentary election campaign, Jones openly supported the Whig candidates from Carlisle saying that 'the Whigs had now come round to the Democrats, and joined hands with them'.
The article in the Reynolds's Newspaper quoted Jones' remarks of more than ten years before (published by the Democrat newspaper of Carlisle) which did not tally with his later actions: 'The Whigs are the political adventurers; .
.
.
they are the men who keep their hands in the pockets of the people; they are tricky politicians.
On each side of them stand two classes—one on each side of them, and the thief is in the middle.
The one is the Tory; the other is the Radical; and the Whig—the thief—is in the middle.
'—166 2S7 This letter is the rough draft of Engels' reply to W.
Holzenhauer's letter of 18 August 1868.
Holzenhauer wrote that he had been employed by the firm of Ermen and Engels in Engelskirchen for 18 years, from the time of its foundation (see Note 238), and had been dismissed after a quarrel with Adolf von Griesheim.
—169 238 A reference to the German branch of the firm Ermen & Engels —at Engelskirchen (near Cologne) founded c.
1840 by Friedrich Engels Sr.
, which ran the German side of the enterprise with the assistance of Anthony Ermen.
The firm had its offices in Barmen.
After their father's death in March 1860, Engels' brothers Hermann, Rudolf and Emil suggested that Frederick should give his share in the business over to them.
One of the reasons they named was that he had been living abroad since 1849.
Engels was to receive £10,000 in compensation to consolidate his legal and financial position in the firm of Ermen & Engels in Manchester.
He became its co-owner in 1864 (see also Note 158).

—169, 269 240 A reference to Schweitzer's reply of 2 December 1868 to Marx's letter of 13 October 1868 (see this volume, pp.
132-35).
Schweitzer defended the draft Statutes of the Lassallean trade unions (which Marx had criticised) and the political course of the General Association of German Workers which he headed (see notes 104 and 164).
Schweitzer declared that he had more rea­ son for leadership of the German workers' movement than Liebknecht, and claimed that control should be concentrated in his hands.
As he put it, a reconciliation between Liebknecht and him was possible only if Marx, whom both sides recognised as the 'spiritual Eminence' should personally intervene to support Schweitzer against Liebknecht.
—172, 175, 176 22-983 241 A reference to the letter from the Saxon miners of Lugau, Nieder-Würschnitz and Oelsnitz, dated 15 November 1868, which expressed their wish to join the International, was sent to Marx and read at the General Council meeting of 24 November 1868 (see Note 281).
—172, 176 242 In his letter to the General Council of 29 November 1868, written on behalf of the Central Committee of the German-speaking sections in Geneva, Johann Philipp Becker wrote that Bebel, President of the Union of the German Workers' Associations (see Note 169), had stated in his circular letter that societies could join the International Working Men's Association without paying membership dues.
Bebel's purpose in doing so was to popularise the resolution on joining the International passed by the Nuremberg Congress (see Note 135).
This question was discussed at the General Council meeting on 15 December 1868, at which Marx stated that he had requested Liebknecht to remove that point from the circular letter.
—172 243 A reference to the formation of a new Cabinet under Gladstone.
On that occasion, The Times featured an editorial which contained, among other things, predictions about the appointments likely to be taken up by Lowe and Bright (see The Times, No.
26300, 5 December 1868).
—176 244 Above the address in the original is the oval seal of the General (Central) Council with the inscription: 'International Working Men's Association, Central Council, London'.
—177, 195 246 A reference to Sigfrid Meyer's letter of 24 November 1868, which was a reply to Marx's letter of 28 October 1868 (see this volume, pp.
148-49).
Meyer wrote about the progress of the labour movement in the USA and the work he was doing with August Vogt to set up a German Section of the International in New York.
—177 246 A reference to the cotton crisis produced by the cessation of cotton deliveries from the USA due to the blockade of the slave-owning Southern states by the Northern states' navy during the Civil War of 1861-65.
The cotton famine in Britain began just before the overproduction crisis and merged with it.
Since 1862, and for two or three years, three-quarters of the cotton mills in Lancashire, Cheshire, and some other counties stood totally or partially idle.
—179 247 Marx quotes Kugelmann's letter of 7 December 1868 that contained Joseph Dietzgen's address for which Marx had asked (see this volume, p.
173) and some information about him.
Enclosed with the letter was Dietzgen's photograph and W.

—184 250 This letter is a rough draft of Marx's reply to the letter from the firm of Asher & Co.
, Foreign Booksellers & Publishers, 12 December 1868.
It contained a request for a copy of Marx's pamphlet Herr Vogt, which was not available in London.
The fair copy of the letter has not been found.
—185 251 A reference to the letter from A.
A.
Serno-Solovyevich to Marx of 20 November 1868, in which he requested Marx, on behalf of the commission Notes 603 preparing the workers' newspaper L'Égalité, to be a permanent correspondent of this printed organ of the French Section of the International Working Men's Association.
—186 252 The Brimstone Gang —a students' association at the University of Jena in the 1770s which was notorious for its brawls; subsequently the expression became widespread.
In 1849-50, it was the jocular nickname of the group of German petty-bourgeois émigrés in Geneva.
In 1859, petty-bourgeois democrat Karl Vogt made a number of slanderous statements in which he associated the activities of the Brimstone Gang with Marx and his followers.
Marx refuted his allegations in his pamphlet Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol.
17, pp.
28-37).
—186 253 A reference to the blockade of the Southern ports, from which cotton was shipped to England, declared by Lincoln on 19 April 1861.
The blockade, which lasted till August 1865, was not very effective, however, since contraband trade developed between the Southern states and England and also between the South and the North.
Liverpool played a special role in the smuggling of commodities between England and the Confederation: for the first two years of the war 31 thousand bales of pressed cotton were delivered there.
(See K.
Marx, 'The British Cotton Trade' and 'The Crisis in England', present edition, Vol.
19, pp.
17-20 and 53-56.
)—186 254 Marx refers to the speech made by Louis Michel on 13 November 1851 in the Legislative Assembly (see Le Moniteur universel, No.
318, 14 November 1851, supplement 1) concerning the Bill introduced on 6 November 1851 by the royalists Le Flô, Baze and Panat, questors of the Legislative Assembly (deputies of the Assembly in charge of economic and financial matters and security).
The Bill, which gave the Chairman of the Legislative Assembly the right to summon troops, was rejected on 17 November.
When the vote was taken, the Montagne supported the Bonapartists, seeing the royalists as the principal danger.
—188 255 A reference to the meeting of the deputies of the Party of Order at the French Legislative Assembly held in the Mayor's office of Paris' 10th district on 2 December 1851.
It adopted a resolution on Louis Napoleon's resignation from the post of President and the transition of power to the Legislative Assembly.
The deputies refused to apply to workers for support.
This attempt at legalised opposition to the coup d'état was immediately suppressed by the police and the troops.
Participants in the meeting were arrested.
A detailed report of the meeting was published in: E.
Ténot, Paris en décembre 1851.
Étude historique sur le coup d'état, Paris, 1868, pp.
142-64.
— 188, 191 256 A reference to the Frankfurt Parliament or the German National Assembly, which was convened after the March revolution in Germany and first met on 18 May 1848 in Frankfurt am Main.
Its principal goal was to overcome the political fragmentation of the country and work out a German constitution.
The liberal deputies, who were in the majority, turned the Assembly into a mere debating club.
It did not dare call upon the people to rebuff the onslaught of counter-revolution and defend the constitution.
When the major German states recalled their deputies, and the authorities of Frankfurt am Main banned meetings within the city limits, the left-wing elements moved to Stuttgart and tried to launch a legal campaign in defence of the imperial constitution, but were dispersed by the troops on 18 June 1849.
Marx and Engels severely criticised the activities of the Frankfurt National Assembly in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (see present edition, vols.
7, 8 and 9).
—189 22* 604 257 This refers to the Programme and Rules of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy (Programme et Règlement de l'Alliance Internationale de la Démocratie Socialiste), founded by Mikhail Bakunin, in Geneva in October 1868.
Besides Bakunin, members of its Provisional Committee were Brosset, Duval, Guétat, Perron, Zagorsky and Johann Philipp Becker.
In 1868 leaflets in French and German containing these documents were published in Geneva.
On 29 November, Becker, who shortly afterwards broke with Bakunin, sent the Alliance's Programme and Rules to the General Council for approval.
On 15 December, the General Council spoke against the admission of the Alliance to the International Working Men's Association, and on 22 December unanimously approved, with insignificant amendments, a circular letter 'The International Working Men's Association and the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy' (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
34-36) written by Marx and approved by Engels, which exposed the Alliance's wish to split the workers' movement (see this volume, p.
192).
The circular letter was sent out to all the sections of the International as a confidential communication.
For the text of the Programme and Rules of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy with Marx's remarks, see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
207-11.
—190, 191, 201, 211, 218, 413, 424, 489 258 After the victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in France in February 1848, foreigners residing in Paris conceived the idea of setting up armed legions for the purpose of establishing republics in their home countries.
Marx and Engels were resolutely opposed to the export of revolution as an adventurist and unsound venture which doomed the revolutionary forces to destruction.
A case in point was the fate of the Belgian republican legion which was making its way home from Paris and was ambushed by Belgian government troops on 29 March 1849 immediately after crossing the French border near the village of Risquons-Tout (see also Engels' article 'The Antwerp Death Sentences', present edition, Vol.
7, pp.
404-06).
—195 259 in November 1868, the reformist trade union leaders in Britain (Applegarth, etc.
) took part in the setting up of a committee for the organisation on behalf of the workers of a banquet in honour of the American Ambassador in London Reverdy Johnson.
On 1 December 1868, the General Council made public the committee's letter which suggested that the Council should send its representa­ tive to the banquet.
Marx, who was opposed to the workers' participation in the organisation of such a function, said that Johnson 'did not represent the working classes of America [and that] the working classes ought not to go in the wake of the upper and middle classes'.
The General Council resolved to send Robert Shaw and Hermann Jung to the committee's organisational meeting to campaign against this sort of undertaking.
Thanks to the steps taken by the General Council representatives, the attempt to give a reception in honour of Johnson on behalf of the workers failed.
—195 260 An excerpt from this letter .
was published in the Sotheby Parke Bernet and C° catalogue on 19 April 1977.
—196 261 Marx apparently sent his daughter Laura a volume of poetry by Rücken, a German Romantic poet, whose work was influenced by Goethe's Oriental poetry.
—196 262 The Corn Laws (first introduced in the fifteenth century) imposed high import duties on agricultural produce in the interests of landowners in order to maintain high prices for these products on the home market.
In 1838 the Notes 605 Manchester factory owners Cobden and Bright founded the Anti-Corn Law League, which demanded the lifting of the corn tariffs and urged unlimited freedom of trade with the aim of weakening the economic and political power of the landed aristocracy and reducing workers' wages.
The struggle between industrial bourgeoisie and the landed aristocracy over the Corn Laws ended in 1846 with their repeal.
—196 263 Marx refers to the second section of Chapter VI in the first German edition (1867) of Volume One of Capital entitled 'Die s.
g.
ursprüngliche Accumula­ tion'.
In the second (1872) and subsequent German editions the structure of the volume underwent changes.
The above-mentioned Chapter VI came to form Part VII, while the second section of it became Chapter XXIV.
Corresponding to this section in the English edition of 1887 prepared by Engels are chapters XXVI-XXXII, Part VIII ('The So-Called Primitive Accumu­ lation', see present edition, Vol.
35).
—197 264 A reference to Bakunin's letter to Marx of 22 December 1868 (see Die Neue Zeit, Bd.
I, No.
1, Stuttgart, 1900-1901, S.
6-8).
—198, 202 265 De pa epe took a firm stand on the policy of Bakunin and his followers who intended to split and disorganise the International.
In a letter of 16 January 1869, addressed to the initiating committee of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy (see Note 257), De Paepe criticised the activities of the Bakuninists and their programme and supported the decision of the General Council on the Alliance passed on 22 December 1868 (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
34-36).
—198 266 Marx is referring to the economic struggle of the Swiss weavers and building workers, which began on 9 November 1868 with the strike of the ribbon-weavers and dyers in Basle and lasted until the spring of 1869.
Marx described it in detail in the 'Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress of the International Working Men's Association' (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
68-82).
—198, 199, 203, 209 267 A reference to the meeting of the General Council Sub-Committee held on Saturday, 2 January 1869, which discussed the question of the lockouts declared by the textile manufacturers in Rouen and Basle (see notes 266, 272).
—198 268 Herzen announced his decision not to take any further part in the publication of the Kolokol (The Bell) in 'Lettre à N.
Ogareff in No.
14-15, 1 December 1868.
—200 269 Seven Dials was a poor district in London between Charing Cross and Oxford Street.
The place got its name because on this crossing of seven streets once stood a pillar surmounted by seven dials, one for each street.
The pillar was removed in 1773.
—201 270 f he 'Provisional Rules of the Association' written by Marx (see present edition, Vol.
20), which the General Council unanimously approved on 1 November 1864, was published in English, together with the 'Inaugural Address', as a pamphlet entitled Address and Provisional Rules of the Working Men's International Association.
.
.
in London in November 1864, and in The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No.
161, 12 November 1864.
The translation of the 'Provisional Rules' into French made in late 1864-early 1865 contained a number of inaccuracies through the fault of the Proudhonist leaders of the Paris Section.
The new and corrected French translation was made by Charles 606 Longuet under Marx's supervision and was included in the pamphlet Manifeste de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs suivi du Règlement provisoire, which appeared in Brussels in 1866.
The Geneva Congress of 1866 approved the Rules (General Rules) and amplified them with Regulations (later Administra­ tive Regulations).
These documents were published in late November 1866 in the pamphlet Association Internationale des Travailleurs.
Statuts et règlement, Londres, 1866 (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
441).
However, the publication remained little known, as out of the 1,000 copies issued, 800 were held up at a frontier post on their way to France.
A separate edition of the Rules and Regulations in English appeared in London in 1867 under the heading 'Rules of the International Working Men's Association', London, 1867.
— 202 The League of Peace and Freedom was a pacifist organisation set up in 1867 in Switzerland with the active participation of Victor Hugo and Giuseppe Garibaldi.
In 1867-68, Bakunin took part in its work.
At the outset the League, influenced by Bakunin, tried to use the workers' movement and the International Working Men's Association for its own ends.
Voicing the anti-militarist sentiments of the people, the League's leaders, however, approached peace action from a pacifist stand, refused to reveal the social causes of wars and not infrequently reduced anti-militarist actions to mere declarations.
The League's Inaugural Congress was scheduled for 9 September 1867 (originally 5 September) in Geneva to coincide with the conclusion of the Lausanne Congress of the International (2-8 September 1867).
At the General Council meeting of 13 August (see The Bee-Hive Newspaper, 17 August 1867), Marx spoke against the International's official participation in the League's Inaugural Congress, since this would have signified approval of its bourgeois programme, but suggested that some members of the International should attend the Congress on their own to try and make it adopt revolutionary and democratic decisions.
The Lausanne Congress ignored the decision of the General Council and, influenced by petty-bourgeois elements, resolved to be officially represented at the League's congress.
Marx's tactics against the League of Peace and Freedom were fully approved by the Brussels Congress of the International (see Note 138).
—202, 489 In December 1868, following the wage cuts in the cotton yarns and goods industry, a wave of strikes began in various regions of France, the most important being the one in Sotteville-lès-Rouen.
The Rouen Section of the International arranged for the strikers to receive support from workers in other industries in Paris and Rouen.
The Rouen Section applied for aid to the General Council.
The c]uestion of the strikes in Rouen and Vienne was discussed on 5 January 1869 at the Council meeting.
On Marx's proposal, it was unanimously decided to voice a protest against the arbitrary rule of the French manufacturers (the resolution was published in The Bee-Hive, No.
379, 16 January 1869).
The Council requested the British workers to render aid to the locked-out workers of Rouen and took other steps to give material aid to the strikers.
A detailed account of the strike in Rouen was presented in the 'Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress of the International Working Men's Association' written by Marx (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
73-74).
—203 A reference to the Polish Insurrection Cross, the symbol of the Polish people's national liberation struggle, given to Jenny Marx on her birthday.
Since late Notes 607 1867 Jenny wore this cross on a green ribbon, the national colour of Ireland, as a sign of mourning for the Fenians executed on 23 November 1867.
—206, 214 274 On Marx's advice, Borkheim wrote eleven articles brought together in the series Russische Briefe (Russian letters): on the Russian railways (I-VII), on Mikhail Bakunin (VIII-X), and on the Russian press (XI).
They appeared in Die Zukunft in January-August and November of 1869 and in February and March of 1870.
In a letter to Engels of 19 January 1869, Borkheim asked him to recommend books for use in his work on the articles.
—206, 436 276 This letter is written on a form with the letterhead: 'Memorandum from Ermen & Engels to M'.
—206, 207 27fi A reference to the Constitution of the Swiss Confederation adopted on 12 September 1848.
It granted the population the right to take part in exercising legislative power in the forms of Volksanregung and Initiativ­ begehren.
In place of a former Diet, the central legislative body, the Federal Assembly, consisting of a National Council and Council of States, was set up.
—209 277 A reference to the fact that up to August 1869, the Demokratisches Worchenblatt edited by Liebknecht remained a joint press organ of the German People's Party (see Note 38) and the Union of German Workers' Associations (see Note 169).
— 210 278 Marx's work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (see present edition, Vol.
11), in which, following the events, Marx revealed the essence of Bonapartism, drew attention of the leaders of the working-class movement in the 1860s.
In 1864 Wilhelm Liebknecht tried to arrange a new publication of the work in Switzerland.
Sophie von Hatzfeldt, Lassalle's friend and associate, offered assistance.
Marx, however, turned it down (see Marx to Sophie von Hatzfeldt, 22 December 1864, present edition, Vol.
42).
In 1865, Marx apparently had the idea of publishing a collection of his and Engels' works in Germany.
The edition was to include also The Eighteenth Brumaire.
.
.
(see Marx to Wilhelm Liebknecht, 24 June 1865, present edition, Vol.
42).
Marx and Engels planned to enlist the services of Otto Meissner, the publisher of Volume One of Capital (see Engels to Marx, 27 April 1867, present edition, Vol.
42).
The negotiations were, however, protracted.
Against the background of the exacerbating crisis of the Second Empire in France, Marx stepped up his efforts to get a second edition of the work printed.
Already in late January 1869, Marx, who on 27 January had received Meissner's agreement to undertake a second edition of The Eighteenth Brumaire.
.
.
, sent him a corrected version (see this volume, Marx to Ludwig Kugelmann, 11 May 1869, and p.
222).
The second authorised German edition of this work appeared in Hamburg in late July 1869.
—211 279 Marx addressed the same request concerning his work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte to a number of his friends, including Borkheim.
It was F.
Wohlauer who sent Marx a copy of the book probably together with the letter of 1 February 1869.
—211 280 Marx refers to Gustav Adolf Bachmann's letter of 31 January 1869 with the request of the Lugau workers to be affiliated with the International Working Men's Association.
See Die I.
Internationale in Deutschland, Berlin, 1964, S.
295.
—214, 219 281 Engels wrote the 'Report on the Miners' Guilds in the Coalfields of Saxony' (see present edition, Vol.
21) at Marx's request on the basis of material sent in by 608 Notes the Saxon miners from Lugau, Nieder-Würschnitz and Oelsnitz, who informed the General Council and Marx personally of their wish to join the International (see Note 241).
The report, which Engels had written in English, was read at the General Council meeting of 23 February 1869.
An abridged version appeared in The Bee-Hive, No.
385, 27 February 1869.
Other English newspapers, including The Times, The Daily News and The Morning Advertiser, refused to carry the report.
In early March 1869 Marx himself translated it into German, and it was published in Der Social-Demokrat, No.
33, 17 March, Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
12 (supplement), 20 March, and Die Zukunft, nos.
67 and 68, 20 and 21 March 1869.
—214, 219, 220, 221, 223, 226, 227, 230, 244 282 As is clear from Lafargue's letter to Marx's wife Jenny, written before 12 February 1869, the matter under discussion was Lafargue's negotiations with the French authoress Clémence Royer about the translation of Volume One of Capital into French.
The negotiations proved unproductive.
On the translation of Capital into French, see also notes 309 and 441.
—217 283 A reference to the plan for the publication of a French daily political newspaper La Renaissance, to be started in 1869.
Among the proposed staff members were Blanquists (Jaclard, Tridon etc.
) and republicans (Ranc).
A major contribution to the work was made by Lafargue, who wrote two articles, one a critique of Proudhonism, and the other a concise exposition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party (the manuscripts are not extant).
Lafargue tried to persuade Marx to contribute to the newspaper.
Due to a shortage of funds the project fell through, but the preparations had gone so far that in early 1869, a prospectus 'Pour paraître le 24 février [18]69.
La Renaissance, Journal politique hebdomadaire' was brought out.
—217, 220, 225, 287, 290, 308, 316 284 The Berne Congress of the League of Peace and Freedom (see Note 271) took place on 21-25 September 1868.
—218 285 A reference to the preparatory materials for Borkheim's articles 'Michael Bakunin' (VIII-X) in the Russische Briefe series (see Note 274), brought out by Die Zukunft on 21 July, 13 and 15 August and 2 November 1869.
Among the materials used by Borkheim was Bakunin's 'Address to the Russian, Polish and All Slavic Friends' (printed in the Kolohol, No.
123-124, supplement, 15 Feb­ ruary 1862).
—219, 223 286 Engels visited Marx in London from around 4 to 7 February 1869.
—222 287 Marx is referring to the book: J.
L.
Foster, An Essay on the Principles of Commercial Exchanges between England and Ireland, London, 1804.
The source of this research was the material collected by two Parliamentary commissions, the Secret Committee of the House of Lords and the Select Committee of the House of Commons, appointed in 1797 to investigate the affairs of the Bank of England in connection with the operation of the so-called Bank Restriction Act, promulgated on 3 May 1797.
It introduced a compulsory exchange-rate of the Bank of England bank-notes and cancelled the exchange of bank-notes into gold.
In 1819, the British Parliament adopted a new law which re-established the exchange of bank-notes into gold.
The exchange was completely restored by 1821.
A synopsis of Foster's book made by Marx is extant.
Marx made it in his notebook of excerpts entitled 'Heft II.
1869' probably right after he had received the book.
—224 Notes 609 288 This is probably an error.
W.
Blake's work Observations on the Principles Which Regulate the Course of Exchange; and on the Present Depreciated State of the Currency, which deals with the difference between the nominal and the real rate of exchange, appeared in London in 1810.
In 1802, a book by W.
T.
Thornton An Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain was published in London.
W.
Blake repeatedly refers to Thornton's work in the sections on the real and nominal rate of exchange.
Marx's synopses of the works by Blake and Thornton have come down to us.
They are to be found in Marx's II and VI London notebooks of excerpts of 1850-53 (see MEGA 2, IV/7, S.
115-27 and 506-27).
Marx mentions William Petty's works dealing with the difference between the nominal and the real rate of exchange in the Theories of Surplus-Value (see present edition, Vol.
34).
—224 289 Marx is referring to the decision of the British Government to pardon some of the Fenians who took part in the 1867 uprising.
A statement to this effect was made by C.
Fortescue-Parkinson, Chief Secretary for Ireland, at the House of Commons on 22 February 1869 (see The Times, No.
26368, 23 February 1869).
Under the new decision, 49 out of 81 convicts, at that time undergoing penal servitude in Australia and Great Britain, were liable to unconditional pardon.
'The class to which he referred might be described as partly young men, hot-headed and easily led, literally the dupes and tools of others and incapable, as far as can be ascertained, of doing mischief to the public hereafter, if undirected,' wrote The Times.
—224 290 Marx likens Gladstone's cabinet (1868-74) to the 'Cabinet of All the Talents'; this ironic name had been given to the notorious Coalition Ministry of Lord Aberdeen (1852-55).
A characteristic of the 'Cabinet of All the Talents' is contained in the article by Marx and Engels, 'The Late British Government' (see present edition, Vol.
13, p.
620).
—224 291 A reference to the negotiations on the payment of damages inflicted on the United States by Britain, which during the American Civil War of 1861-65 rendered assistance to the insurgent slave-owning Southern states, specifically, by equipping warships for them.
Among these, the principal one was the Alabama, which operated against the Northerners from August 1862 to July 1864.
On 23 November 1868, representatives of the USA and Great Britain signed a convention to cover all Anglo-American claims since 1853 Jbut ignoring those of the Alabama.
The dispute was finally settled on 14 September 1872, when the Geneva tribunal ruled that Britain should pay $15.
5 mln to the United States.
—225 292 Marx quotes a translation into Scots made by John Bellenden of a Scottish 16th century chronicle originally written by Hector Boece, a poet and chronicler.
The translation was published in Edinburgh in 1536 under the title The History and Chronicles of Scotland and reprinted in 1821.
The original, written in Latin, first appeared in Paris in 1527 under the title Scotorum Historiae a prima gentis origine cum aliarum et rerum et gentium illustratione non vulgari and reprinted, with supplements, in 1574.
—226, 230 293 A reference to La loi relatif à des mesures de sûreté générale (Law on Public Security Measures) known as La loi des suspects (Suspects Law) adopted by the Corps législatif on 19 February and promulgated on 28 February 1858.
It gave the Emperor and his government unlimited power to exile to different parts of France or Algeria or to banish altogether from French territory any person suspected of hostility to the Second Empire.
—230 294 A reference to Liebknecht's statement of 18 February published by the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
8, 20 February 1869.
In that statement, Liebknecht proposed to appoint the General Council the arbiter in the conflict between Schweitzer and his General Association of German Workers on the one hand, and Bebel, Liebknecht and the workers' unions they headed, on the other.
The note that Schweitzer had refused to recognise the General Council as arbiter appeared in Der Social-Demokrat, No.
24, 24 February 1869.
— 230, 234, 405 295 W'ilhelm Hasenclever was elected to the North German Reichstag at the by-elections of 25 January 1869 not in Essen but in the Duisburg constituency.
He received 6,792 votes while Dr.
Hammacher, a National-Liberal, and Landrat Keßler polled 2,665 and 2,142 votes respectively (4,807 in all).
As the source of the information about the outcome of the elections Engels used Der Social-Demokrat, 28 February 1869, which mistakenly stated that Hasenclever's superiority amounted to 992 votes.
—230 296 In a letter of 14 February 1869, Kugelmann advised Marx to send an autographed copy of Volume One of Capital to A.
Quételet, probably hoping to prompt the latter to contribute a review to the press.
Kugelmann was impressed by Quetelet's book Zur Naturgeschichte der Gesellschaft.

Tomes I-II, Paris, 1835 (Marx used the English translation published in Edinburgh in 1842) and Du système social et de lois, qui le régissent, Paris, 1848.
Extracts are extant which Marx copied out of these books in 1851 and probably in 1865-66.
—232 298 xhe Liberal Union (l'Union Libe'rale), a coalition of bourgeois republicans, Orleanists and a part of the Legitimists formed as a result of their joint opposition to the Empire during the 1863-64 election campaign to the Corps législatif.
Another attempt to form a liberal union at the time of the 1869 election campaign failed owing to dissent between the parties which had comprised the coalition in 1863.
Moderate bourgeois republicans (Jules Favre, Jules Simon and others) advocated a union with the monarchists and supported the Orleanist Dufaure who, however, lost the elections.
— 232 299 A reference to the second letter of the Alliance of Socialist Democracy Central Bureau (see Note 257) of 27 February 1869, a reply to the General Council's circular letter which contained a refusal to admit the Alliance to the International Working Men's Association as an independent international organisation.
The Alliance voiced its readiness to disband if the General Council approved its Programme and agreed to admit individual sections of the Alliance to the International.
Marx received the Alliance's address from Eccarius, who enclosed it with his letter of 4 March 1869.
—235, 240 300 Marx discussed the draft of the reply 'The General Council of the International Working Men's Association to the Central Bureau of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy' with Engels; it was unanimously approved by the Council at the meeting of 9 March 1869.
The document was written by Marx in English and French (see present edition, Vol.
21), and confidentially communicated to the corresponding secretaries of the International's sections.
The document was published for the first time in 1872, in the private circular of the General Council Fictitious Splits in the International (see present edition, Vol.
23).
—235, 237 Notes 611 301 On the insistence of the General Council, Article 2 of the Alliance's Programme was changed in April 1869 to read as follows: 'It is above all working for the complete and final abolition of classes and for the political, economic and social equalisation of persons of both sexes.
'—236, 491 302 The second edition of Engels' The Peasant War in Germany (see present edition, Vol.

21).
— 237 303 Marx's work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte was translated into French after Marx's death by the French socialist Edouard Fortin.
The translation was published in the central organ of the Workers' Party of France Le Socialiste (Paris) in January-November 1891.
It appeared as a separate edition that same year in Lille: Le Dixhuit Brumaire de Louis Bonaparte par Karl Marx.
—238 804 Engels refers to Wilhelm Angerstein's letter of 9 March 1868, in which the latter requested him to contribute to a new Austrian workers' newspaper.
On 11 March 1868 Marx received an offer from Angerstein to contribute to the Viennese newspapers Der Telegraph and Arbeiter-Zeitung.
See Engels to Marx, 13 March, and Marx to Engels, 14 March 1868 (present edition, Vol.
42).
—238 305 Following in the steps of the ribbon-weavers, the Basle dyers also went on strike on 9 November 1868 (see Note 266).
The strike lasted until spring of 1869 and developed into a campaign for the existence of the International in Basle, where its next congress was to be held by decision of the Brussels Congress.
In many countries, members of the International launched a mass campaign of solidarity with the striking Basle workers.
Apart from the 'Bericht über die Arbeiterbewegung in Basel' published in Der Vorbote for December 1868, the events were described by Johann Philipp Becker in his pamphlet Die Internationale Arbeiter-Association und die Arbeiter­ bewegung in Basel im Winter 1868 auf 1869, Genf, 1869.
—238 306 In a letter to Marx of 8 March 1869, Otto Meissner wrote that the printing of the second German edition of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte had been postponed for commercial reasons (the time between the New Year and Easter being unfavourable for book-publishing, while later, Marx could have counted on proofs).
— 239, 241 307 A reference to three articles by Marx, 'The Defeat of June 1848', 'June 13, 1849' and 'Consequences of June 13, 1849' published in 1850 in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.
Politisch-ökonomische Revue, nos l, 2 and 3, which later formed the principal part of the book The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 (see present edition, Vol.
10, pp.

In 1895, Engels reprinted the articles from the Revue in German with his introduction (see present edition, Vol.
27).
—241, 242 308 When he was about to travel to Karlsbad for a cure, Marx made an attempt to become a British subject in August 1874, as a precaution against possible reprisals by Austrian authorities.
In Austria, as in a number of other European countries, members of the workers' and democratic movement could be taken to court for merely corresponding with Marx.
A Special Report of the Metropolitan Police Office, Scotland Yard, is extant which was drawn up in connection with Marx's application for citizenship and in which Marx is characterised as follows: '.
.
.
he is the notorious German agitator, the head of 612 Notes the International Society, and an advocate of Communistic principles.
This man has not been loyal to his own King and Country.
' Marx's request was not granted for reasons which had probably not been explained to him.
—243, 248, 563 309 Marx attached considerable importance to the publishing of the French translation of Capital.
Ever since 1867, negotiations with Elisée Reclus through Victor Schily had been under way in Paris.
Reclus undertook to do the translation in collaboration,with Moses Hess.
Judging from Schily's letter to Marx of 24 January 1868, Elisée Reclus and Moses Hess intended not so much to translate Capital as to abridge it in order to adapt it to the needs and tastes of the French public.
The negotiations, which lasted for almost three years, were unproductive.
In early 1868, an offer to translate Capital came from Jo'sef Cwierczakiewicz (alias Card), a Polish émigré in Geneva.
Marx turned the offer down (see present edition, Vol.
42, p.
528, 532-33).
In December 1868 Lafargue entered into negotiations with the French authoress Clémence Royer over a translation of Capital (see Note 282).
For subsequent attempts to get Capital translated into French, see Note 441.

— 249 3U A reference to August Bebel's letter to Marx of 27 March 1869 written in connection with the dispute between Bebel and Liebknecht, on the one hand, and Schweitzer, on the other, at the congress of the General Association of German Workers held in Barmen-Elberfeld on 28-31 March 1869.
Pressured by the workers, Schweitzer was obliged to meet half-way the demand of the Association's Leipzig members for an open discussion with Liebknecht, and for his and Bebel's presence at the Barmen-Elberfeld congress (see Note 318).
Afraid of losing his prestige in the Association, Schweitzer intended to sub­ mit for discussion a proposal on establishing closer contacts with the Interna­ tional.
Bebel, who had with Liebknecht arrived at Barmen-Elberfeld on the eve of the congress, warned Marx about Schweitzer's demagogic manoeuvres in the above-mentioned letter of 27 March 1869: 'We have heard so much about Schweitzer's mean tricks here that our hair is standing on end.
It is now abundantly clear that Schweitzer has proposed the International's programme solely for the purpose of dealing us a strong blow and splitting up or winning over to his side the majority of the opposition.
I request you therefore on my behalf, and also on that of Liebknecht and our other friends, to ignore for the time being the request to approve the corresponding decision of the congress or at least to give Schweitzer a very cautious reply.
'—249, 250 312 Seeking to stem the growth of the opposition in the General Association of German Workers Schweitzer proposed to join the International Working Men's Association at the general congress in Barmen-Elberfeld (see notes 311 and 318).
His proposal, which was published on 3 February by Der Social-Demokrat, may be summed up as follows: 'a) the Association shares the Programme and goals of the International Working Men's Association; 'b) if the Association does not join the International, this will be solely due to the Law on Associations operating in Germany; 'c) the Association considers itself under obligation to work for a repeal of this law and the realisation of a full and unlimited right to form unions and hold assemblies; and especially to popularise the principle according Notes 613 to which the state has no right to use its laws to prevent a free development of a peaceful workers' movement; 'd) until it becomes possible to join the International, the Association will try, as far as it can, to remain in real accord and maintain real cooperation with the International.
' Schweitzer's proposal was approved by the general congress with an amendment introduced by Bremer, the head of the International's Magdeburg Section: 'e) each member of the General Association of German Workers has a right to be a member of the International Working Men's Association.
' In actual fact, Schweitzer refused to cooperate with Liebknecht and Bebel in uniting the German working-class movement under the International.
The General Association of German Workers did not join the International.
— 249 31S Marx is referring to Joseph Dietzgen's letter of 20 March 1869, in which he wrote about the success of his work in setting up a section of the International Working Men's Association in Siegburg and its environs.
— 249 314 Engels is referring to his 'Report on the Miners' Guilds in the Coalfields of Saxony' (see present edition, Vol.
21, and this volume, Note 281).
Die Zukunft published it on 20 and 21 March 1869, ascribing it to Marx and providing it with an editorial comment: 'The General Council of the International Working Men's Association has resolved to publish the following report by Karl Marx, Secretary of the General Council for Germany, both in the English original and the German translation.

The project had not been carried out.
— 251, 253 316 Between 1867 and 3 April 1869, Engels' domicile was at 25 Dover Street; he referred to 86 Mornington Street, the house he rented for Lizzy Burns and where he himself lived most of the time since August 1864, as his 'unofficial address'.
From 3 April and until September 1870 when he moved to London, Engels' domicile was at 86 Mornington Street.
— 251 317 A reference to the members of the German Party of Progress founded in 1861.
Among its most prominent members were Waldeck, Virchow, Schulze-Delitzsch, Forckenbeck and Hoverbeck.
The Party advocated German unifica­ tion under Prussia, the convocation of an all-German parliament, and the establishment of a liberal ministry accountable to the Chamber of Deputies.
Frightened by the possibility of a popular revolution, it did not support the basic democratic rights, i.
e.
, universal suffrage and freedom of the press, association and assembly.
In 1866, its Right wing broke away to form a National-Liberal Partv which capitulated before the Bismarck Government.
— 252 318 A reference to the dispute between Liebknecht, Bebel and Schweitzer at the congress of the General Association of German Workers held in Barmen-Elberfeld on 28-31 March 1869 (see Note 311).
Bebel and Liebknecht accused Schweitzer of having contacts with the Bismarck Government and of attempts to prevent the formation of a united workers' party in Germany.
The congress showed that Schweitzer's authority had been undermined: 14 delegates representing 4,635 of the Association's members refused to give him a vote of 614 Notes confidence, while 42 delegates with 7,400 votes gave such a vote.
The congress adopted a number of resolutions aimed at restricting Schweitzer's dictatorial powers and making the internal life of the Association more democratic: in addition to the President, it was to be headed by a board of twelve members and its seat was to be in Hamburg.
A proposal was moved to convene a Social-Democratic congress in Germany with a view to 'founding a united organisation'.
On Schweitzer's suggestion, it was resolved to establish closer contacts with the International to the extent permitted by the German law.
In fact, however, the Association's leadership continued to pursue a sectarian policy and obstruct the affiliation of the Association with the International.
— 253, 255, 264 319 Marx is probably referring to a General Council meeting of 1 December 1868, which discussed the question of workers' participation in the campaign to organise the reception for the American Ambassador in London, Reverdy Johnson (see Note 259).

— 253, 523 321 A printers' strike in Geneva began in March 1869 when the owners of printing presses refused to raise the workers' wages, for which the latter had been campaigning for ten years.
The strike was headed by the Romance Federal Committee and the International's sections in Geneva which secured financial support for the strikers from workers in Switzerland, France, Germany and Italy.
For a detailed account of the strike, see Marx's 'Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress of the International Working Men's Association' (present edition, Vol.
21, p.
71).
—254 322 Die Zukunft wrote about this statement by Schweitzer on 2 April 1869: 'It should be noted that Herr von Schweitzer had earlier stated unambiguously that if even the most insignificant minority should refuse to grant him confidence, he would immediately resign.
It seems, however, that he changed his mind again after the voting.
'—255 323 On 3 April 1869, the political affairs section of Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
14, reported: 'Since now there is every reason to hope for, if not the influence, then at least the unification of the various factions of Social-Democracy, we shall henceforth refrain from attacking Herr von Schweitzer in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt so as not to obstruct the unification.
We assume, naturally, that the other side will terminate its attacks against us.
'—255 324 When under discussion during the spring of 1869, the Bill on regulations for handicraft trades in the North German Reichstag was severely criticised by the working-class deputies.
Following Engels' directions (see Note 51), on 18 March Bebel demanded that factory work be subjected to some sort of reglamenta-tion, i.
e.
, that a ten-hour working day be introduced, work on Sundays prohibited, factory inspection organised and freedom of association granted to trade unions (see Die Zukunft, No.
67, 20 March 1869).
Of the numerous proposed amendments, only Bebel's suggestion that 'workers' books' be abolished was adopted.
On 29 May the Bill was passed (see 'Stenographische Berichte über die Verhandlungen des Reichstages der Norddeutschen Bundes.
I.
Legislatur-Periode-Session 1869', I.
Bd.
Berlin, 1869, S.
114-19, 124 and Notes 615 146-48).
Reporting to the General Council on 13 April 1869 about the speeches of the worker deputies at the North German Reichstag, Marx mentioned Bebel's speech in particular (see The General Council of the First International, 1868-1870.
Minutes, Moscow, 1974, pp.
81-82).
—255, 274 325 In a letter to Marx of 3 April 1869, Liebknecht gave an optimistic account of the outcome of the struggle against Schweitzer at the congress of the General Association of German Workers in Barmen-Elberfeld (see Note 318).
According to him, Schweitzer had sustained a crushing defeat, the leadership had passed into the hands of the Hamburg board and strife was extinguished.
Summing up his information, Liebknecht wrote: 'The General Association of German Workers numbers only 11,000 men who have extremely vague political notions and mostly support Bismarck.
Our Union is more numerous and enlightened.
' Liebknecht also wrote about his intention to bring out Engels' work The Peasant War in Germany as a separate pamphlet (2,000 copies) (see present edition, Vol.
10).
—256 ' S26 xhe strike of workers in the cotton yarns and goods industry in Preston (Lancashire) began in March 1869 as a response to the provocative decision of the manufacturers to cut wages by ten per cent.
The General Council and the trade unions organised financial support by workers in other towns, as a result of which the strike lasted until August 1869, and ended in a compromise (wages were reduced by 5 per cent).
Reports on the progress of the strike appeared regularly in The Bee-Hive.
—257, 278, 296 327 A reference to Moll's letter to Marx of 6 April 1869, written on the instructions of the Solingen Section of the International.
Moll wrote: 'The congress of the General Association of German Workers in Barmen-Elberfeld (see notes 311 and 318) has, as you know, largely destroyed Dr.
Schweitzer's personality cult by blowing away the smoke-screen surrounding that power-hungry dictator; the congress advocated joining the International Association, as far as this is permitted by the existing laws.
'Bebel and Liebknecht vigorously championed the International's principles, made accusations against Schweitzer and other delegates and took them by the throat.
Schweitzer did not try to defend himself, although he had intended to do so before the congress.
The assured speeches of many, if not all delegates have made it clear that this Association has many viable elements; our section, like the International Association in general, will grow stronger, since the disunited workers' organisations will join the International.

— 259 329 On the instructions of the Solingen Section of the International (see Note 330), Friedrich Wilhelm Moll wrote to Marx about the disagreements with Schweitzer in his letter of 6 April 1869 (see Note 327).
—260 330 The Solingen Section of the International was set up in February-March 1866.
Its members were in touch with the Central Committee of the German-language sections in Geneva and applied for assistance to the General Council and to Marx and Engels personally.
The most active members of the Section, including Klein and Moll, took part in the International's congresses.
In the autumn of 1867, this Section initiated the establishment of a cooperative of workers engaged in the production of steel and iron goods; it played a major 616 Notes part in the work of the Section (the Rules of the cooperative were drawn up by J.
Ph.
Becker).
—260 331 In the summer of 1866, the Greek population of Crete rebelled against Turkish rule demanding that the island be incorporated into Greece.
Turkish troops undertook harsh punitive measures against the rebels and the island's civilian population.
However, supported by volunteers from many countries, the insurgents carried on their struggle.
The events in Crete provoked a fresh exacerbation of international contradictions in the Balkans.
In November 1866 the Russian tsarist authorities suggested that the European powers should urge the Turkish Empire to hand Crete over to Greece.
However, fearing that Russia would further consolidate its position in the region and that the national liberation movements of the peoples under the Sultan would mount, the Western states preferred Crete to remain under Turkish rule.
Support for the Cretan insurgents was confined to a joint statement by Russia, France, Italy and Prussia on 29 October 1867.
It advised the Turkish Government to refrain from bloodshed on the island.
The conference convened by the European states in Paris in January 1869 to settle the Turkish-Greek conflict forced Greece to discontinue support for the uprising, thereby hastening its defeat.
In 1869, the uprising was suppressed.

Jenny returned to London on 14 April, and Eleanor's visit lasted till 19 May 1869.
—262, 269 333 A reference to Liebknecht's letter to Marx of 12 April 1869.
— 262, 264 334 Ludlow's review of Capital was not published.
The only item about the work in the British bourgeois press appeared in January 1868 in the conservative weekly The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art.
Despite open hostility to the author of Capital, the item noted 'the plausibility of his logic, the vigour of his rhetoric, and the charm with which he invests the driest problems of political economy' (see present edition, Vol.
42, p.
529).
— 263 335 Marx is referring to a work by J.
Janin La fin d'un monde et du neveu de Rameau, written in 1861; it was a sequel to Diderot's novel Le neveu de Rameau, as re-interpreted by Janin.
— 263 336 Engels is probably referring to an article by J.
M.
Ludlow 'Ferdinand Lassalle, the German Social-Democrat' published in The Fortnightly Review on 1 April, and Ludlow's letter to Marx of 12 April 1869, a reply to Marx's letter of 10 April (see this volume, pp.
259-60).
—264 337 This letter was written by Marx over Liebknecht's letter to him of 12 April 1869.
Marx deciphered the names explaining to Engels the following passage from Liebknecht's letter: 'E.

'—266 338 On 12 February 1867, at the elections to the North German Reichstag in Barmen-Elberfeld, Sophie von Hatzfeldt, who headed a small group of Lassalleans that had split away from the General Association of German Workers in 1867 (see Note 104), launched a campaign against Schweitzer.
His candidature was opposed by that of Hillmann which the workers did not support: Hillmann received only 52 votes.
However, Schweitzer, who received 4,668 votes, was not elected either.
— 268 339 At the meeting of the General Council held on 20 April 1869 Marx was instructed to draw up a protest on behalf of the General Council against the Notes 617 massacre of the strikers in Seraing and Frameries (Belgium) in April 1869 (see Note 343).
—270 340 An allusion to the origin of Paul Lafargue, who was born in Santiago de Cuba.
His mother's father was a mulatto, and her mother was an American Indian.
—271, 446 341 Marx's source of information was probably The Times of 24 April 1869, which featured a report 'New York, April 13' in the Telegraphic Despatches column stating that 'Mr.
Clay (to Liberia) and Mr.
Bassett (to Hayti) are the first two coloured diplomatists appointed'.
— 271 342 Marx forwarded to Engels Alphonse Vandenhouten's letter to Marie Bernar, Corresponding Secretary for Belgium, which dealt with the so-called Brussels Liberation Section (or the Revolutionary Committee of the International Association) founded by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois republicans in Brussels in April 1869.
One of the section's leaders was a former police chief.
Its provocative activities and calls for plunder and violence provided the Belgian police with an excuse for persecuting members of the International Association.
The manifesto of this organisation, connected as it was with the French branch in London (see Note 72), was published in La Cigale, No.
16, 18 April 1869.
It was discussed at the General Council meeting of 20 April 1869, which stated that 'there was a party at Brussels who would not conform to the policy of the Central Committee but desired to be affiliated as an independent branch.
In case an application should be made to this effect the Council was asked not to comply till after the Congress.
'—272 343 A reference to the bloody reprisals of the Belgian authorities against the strikers at the Cockerill Ironworks in Seraing and miners in Frameries in April 1869.
These events were discussed at the General Council meetings of 20 and 27 April and 4 May.
Marx was instructed (see Note 339) to draw up an address in English and French on behalf of the Council, and read it out on 4 May 1869, at a General Council meeting.
It was decided to publish and distribute it (see K.
Marx, 'The Belgian Massacres', present edition, Vol.
21).
On his suggestion, it was also decided to launch a mass protest campaign and secure material relief for the victims.
— 275 344 The report of the General Council meeting of 4 May 1869 published in The Bee-Hive, No.

— 276 346 Marx quotes Eccarius' letter of 29 April 1869, informing Marx about the publication of his pamphlet Eines Arbeiters Widerlegung der national-ökonomischen Lehren John Stuart Mill's, Berlin, 1869.
The work was written by Eccarius with Marx's substantial assistance and published for the first time in The Commonwealth newspaper in late 1866-early 1867.
— 276 347 A reference to the second edition (1869) of Marx's work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (see Note 278).
— 276 348 A reference to a number of diplomatic documents published since the 1830s by David Urquhart, a British political figure and writer, and his works on foreign 618 Notes policy.
They appeared in a variety of publications edited by Urquhart, including The Portfolio magazine and the newspapers The Morning Advertiser and The Free Press, which in 1866 was renamed The Diplomatic Review, and also as separate books and pamphlets.
— 278 349 Marx and his daughter Jenny left for a visit to Ludwig Kugelmann in Germany around 10 September 1869 (see this volume, p.

— 287 355 Marx's letter was addressed to London from Manchester, where he and his daughter Eleanor were staving with Engels between 25 May and 14 June 1869.
—287 356 In May 1869, Peter Le Néve Foster, Secretary of the Society of Arts and Trades Board of Directors, sent out letters to a number of persons, including Marx, requesting their consent to be elected to the Society.
Marx's letter of 28 May 1869 was a reply to this proposal.
On 30 June 1869, the Society's general meeting considered 132 candidatures and took a vote, as a result of which Marx was elected a member.
To be admitted, a person had to have three members, at least one being his personal acquaintance, to back his candidature.
For Marx, this was Peter Lund Simmonds, a Dane residing in England, a well-known political writer and author of numerous works on botany and agriculture.
Marx's admittance to the Society of Arts and Trades signified recognition by British scientific quarters of his merits as a scholar and political writer.
The Society of Arts and Trades, which was founded in 1754, set itself the philanthropic and educational goal of 'promoting the arts, trades and commerce'.
Its social composition was varied: its managing bodies included both members of the aristocracy, patrons of the Society, and representatives of 619 a broad cross-section of bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals; among the members were also representatives of trade unions.
In the 1860s, the Society's membership was in excess of 4,000.
In 1853-54, as the mass strike movement began to grow, the Society tried to act as an intermediary between the workers and the manufacturers seeking to take the edge off the class struggle.
Marx sharply criticised this position and even called the organisation the ' "Society of Arts" and tricks' (see present edition, Vol.
12.
p.
612).
Marx's admission to the Society gave him greater access to scientific literature to be found in the Society's library, including its extremely large collection of works by the 17th-19th century economists.
Many of them he used when working on Capital.
He was particularly interested in recent research in the field of economics and natural sciences, specifically, chemistry and agriculture, whose results were published in the Society's journal.
Marx used the materials of the journal for 1859, 1860, 1866 and 1872 in Volume One of Capital (the first and second editions) (see present edition, Vol.
35).
— 287, 297, 372 357 Written across Marx's letter were the words which meant that Marx had signed a written commitment to observe the Rules and Regulations of the Society.

Schweitzer stated at the sitting of the North German Reichstag on 17 May 1869: 'When a red banner is hoisted in Paris over the Tuileries, Europe will go up in flames as it did at the time of the French bourgeoisie's revolution, which opened up the way for European revolutions.
'—289 360 Marx's letter was written on the fourth page of Eleanor Marx's letter to her sister Jenny.

It has come down to us in a manuscript dating from the 13th century, discovered in 1643 by the Icelandic Bishop Sveinsson—the so-called Elder Edda, and in a treatise on the poetry of the scalds compiled in the early 13th century by Snorry Sturluson (Younger Edda).
The Eddas mirrored the state of Scandinavian society at the time of the disintegration of the tribal system and the migration of the peoples.
They include plots and characters from Nordic folklore.

70, 18 June 1869 an address 'Wiederherstellung der Einheit der Lassalle'schen Partei', urging the two rival organisations to unite on the basis of Lassalle's Rules drawn up in 1863.
The address enjoined them, in categorical form, to hold a vote on this issue within three days and to elect a president of the united Association.
Playing on the Notes desire for unity voiced by the workers belonging to the two organisations Schweitzer succeeded in getting the more democratic forms of leadership evolved by the general congress in Barmen-Elberfeld in the spring of 1869 (see Note 311) abolished, in reorganising the Association along the principles proclaimed by Lassalle's Rules, in accordance with which the President was invested with dictatorial powers, and in getting himself re-elected as President of the united Association.
Schweitzer's activities provoked indignation among the members of the Association and hastened the withdrawal from it of its more advanced elements.
Leaders of the opposition in the General Association of German Workers, Wilhelm Bracke, Julius Bremer, Samuel Spier and Theodor Yorck, who consulted Liebknecht and Bebel on 22 June 1869, addressed the Association's members in Magdeburg, urging them to convene a congress for the unification of all Social-Democratic workers in Germany.
The address was published in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
26, 26 June 1869, and as a separate leaflet.
On 27 June 1869, the Union of German Workers' Associations officially supported the address, which was the first step in the practical, preparations for the congress in Eisenach (see Note 373).
—295, 300, 304 364 In a letter to Marx of 24 June 1869, Wilhelm Eichhoff wrote about the difficulty of selling his pamphlet Die Internationale Arbeiterassociation.

—297, 299 365 In a letter to Engels of 2 July 1869, Marx's daughter Jenny gave an ironical account of a soirée at the Kensington Museum: 'What genius the English have for the inventing of melancholy pleasures! Fancy crowd of some 7,000 mutes in full evening dress, wedged in so closely as to be unable either to move about or to sit down, for the chairs, and they were few and far between, a few imperturbable dowagers had taken by storm and stuck to throughout the evening.
Of the works of art (the Queen has sacked all the museums of the people, in order to carry off their treasures to this aristocratic and favourite resorts of the "belated lamented"), it was next to impossible to get a glimpse.
'—297 366 Marx is referring to a passage from Laurence Sterne's novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (Paris, 1832, p.

A mysterious carriage of the body, to cover the defects of the mind.

— 298 369 On 30 June 1869, the contract signed by Engels with his partner Gottfried Ermen (see Note 158) expired.
Since that time, Engels terminated his participation in the Manchester firm Ermen & Engels and devoted himself exclusively to writing, scientific research and party work.
— 299, 310, 312 Notes 621 370 On 29 June 1869, George Henry Moore, an Irish M.

, spoke in the House of Commons disclosing the atrocities perpetrated by the British authorities against the Fenian prisoners and demanded that conditions be improved for those Fenians who had been arrested at the time of the 1867 uprising and had no charge preferred against them.
Replying to Moore's speech, Henry Austin Bruce, the Home Secretary, hypocritically tried to refute the facts cited by Moore and vindicate the actions of the British Government.
The other Irish M.
P.
s, who voiced the wish that the prisoners be treated in a more humane way, by and large justified the repressions against the Fenians.
Moore's proposal was voted down.
Marx defined his attitude to this issue in his articles 'The English Government and the Fenian Prisoners' and 'Record of a Speech on the Irish Question'.

—300, 327, 547 372 In a letter to Marx of 29 June Liebknecht explained his long silence by family matters and party work.
He wrote: 'The conflict with Schweitzer is very much there, and victory will soon be attained; 3/4 of the General Association of German Workers already support us, we are having a conference in Brunswick this coming Sunday, and a congress in August, to which you, Engels and Eccarius will be invited.
You must attend.
In case of extreme need, we'll get hold of some money.
You must show yourself to the German workers.
Write to me straight away so that I can show your letter in Brunswick.

'You must immediately send Us the International's membership cards.
I've been waiting for them for several months.
All German Social-Democrats are now becoming "international", and we shall discuss the best forms of joining at our, probably Basle congress, to which Bebel and I are going.
'You must adapt the 'Communüt Manifesto' for the requirements of agitation.
I never pay heed to enemies, but enemies and those who will become such are worthy of some attention.
'Becker insists that we obey him, but I've told him quite definitely that we are maintaining direct contacts with the General Council.
' In another part of the letter Liebknecht explained in detail the considerable financial difficulties involved in the publication of the Demokratisches Wochenblatt and asked Marx to appeal to Engels for financial assistance.
— 303, 306.
373 A reference to the all-German congress of the Social-Democrats of Germany, Austria and Switzerland held in Eisenach on 7-9 August 1869.
Taking part in it were 263 delegates representing over 150,000 workers; the congress founded an independent revolutionary party of the German proletariat which was called the Social-Democratic Workers' Party.
The congress adopted a programme which incorporated, word for word, the basic provisions of the International's Rules.
The draft Programme was published in the supplement to the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
31, 31 July 1869.
It showed some influence of Lassalleanism but was mostly based on Marxist principles.
The congress defined the status of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party as a section of the International.
Since the Prussian Law on Associations banned all societies which had contacts with other organisations, especially those abroad, the congress decided that the party members should join the International as private persons.
It also discussed the organisational principles of the party.
The plan proposed by J.
Ph.
Becker (see Note 409) did not meet with support.
August 622 Notes Bebel, who made a report on the Programme and the organisational issue, emphasised the need to adopt Rules which would preclude a personal dictatorship.
The Rules that were approved were drawn up along democratic lines.
—303, 332, 335, 345, 544 374 A reference to the clash of miners with the police and troops near Mold, Denbighshire.
The workers protested against the lowering of the wages and the atrocities of the mine manager.
On 28 May 1869 a crowd of unarmed miners made an attempt to set free their arrested fellow-workers but they were fired on.
Five people were killed and many wounded.
The court acquitted the authorities and sentenced the 'rebels' to ten years' hard labour.
Home Secretary Bruce declared in the House of Commons that the troops had a right to shoot at the crowd in self-defence without obtaining permission from the authorities.

—305, 308 375 The Riot Act, which was promulgated in 1715, banned all'riotous assemblies' of more than 12 persons; in case of its violation, the authorities were obliged to read out a special warning and use force if the assembly did not disperse within an hour.
—305 376 The Arms Act regarded everyone carrying arms without a permit as a violator of public law and order, liable to a court trial.
Under George III, in the late 18th century, an act was promulgated which also banned learning the use of arms without prior official permission.
— 305 377 As a result of a vigorous campaign by the British trade unions for their legalisation, in the spring of 1869 the Royal Commission submitted to Parliament a Bill on the recognition of the unions' legal rights.
The Trade Union's Act was passed in 1871.
—305 378 The collection Agricultural Statistics, Ireland.

Ireland'.
—306 379 A reference to the Congress of the First International held in Basle on 6-11 September 1869.
It was attended by 78 delegates from England, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Spain and North America.
Marx was not present at the Congress but took an active part in preparing it.
The General Council Minutes include his speeches dealing with individual items on the Congress's agenda: the agrarian question (6 July), the right of inheritance (20 July) and public education (10 and 17 August) (see present edition, Vol.
21).
The question of the right of inheritance was entered on the agenda, which was approved on 22 June 1869, at the suggestion of the Geneva Section headed by the Bakuninists.
They proposed to annihilate the right of inheritance, believing this to be the only means of eliminating private property and social injustice.
At the General Council meeting of 3 August, Marx read out a Report of the General Council on the Right of Inheritance, prepared by him,which was approved and submitted to the Congress on behalf of the Council.
However, at the Congress itself the question of the right of inheritance provoked a heated Notes 623 debate.
Despite the opposition of Liebknecht and De Paepe, Bakunin managed to win some of the delegates over to his side.
No resolution concerning this matter was passed.
After discussing the land question for a second time (the first discussion of land ownership took place at the Brussels Congress [see Note 138]) the majority of the Basle Congress delegates voted for abolishing private property in land and converting it over into common property; the Congress also passed resolutions on the unification of trade unions at the national and international levels.
The Basle Congress was the scene of the first clash between supporters of Marx and Engels, and the followers of Bakunin's anarchist doctrine.
The latter failed to assume leadership in the International Working Men's Association.
The Basle Congress confirmed that the General Council was to remain in London.
In order to consolidate the unity and organisation of the International, the General Council was granted a right to expel from the International any section that did not comply with its Rules, on condition that the Federal Council and the Congress approved.

—310 383 Replies by Engels to letters from Marx's daughter Jenny of 24 June and 2 July 1869.
In the letter of 2 July, Jenny gave an ironic description of an aristocratic soirée at the Kensington Museum on 1 July, to which she and Marx were invited by the educational Society of Arts (see this volume, pp.
297-98 and Note 365).
—310.
384 Enclosed with the invitation to the Kensington Museum was a printed warning that said: 'The Council of the Society of Arts appeal with confidence to the members to assist in preventing the mobbing and following any Royal and distinguished persons who may attend the Conversazione of the Society on the 1st of July, and request them to assist in enabling such visitors to enjoy the privilege of walking about unmolested, and seeing the objects of art, like any private person.

—313 387 A reference to the reconstruction of Paris undertaken by G.
E.
Haussmann, 624 Notes Prefect of the Seine Department, for the purpose of building new suburbs with broad streets and avenues.
The reconstruction also aimed at preventing barricade fighting during uprisings.
— 316 388 The elections to the Corps législatif in May-June 1869 spelled considerable success to the anti-Bonapartist opposition despite the repressions of Napoleon Ill's government.
At an extraordinary session in July 1869, 116 deputies belonging to the liberal opposition and Left Centre signed a statement on the need to form a responsible ministry and expand the rights of the Corps législatif.
At the sittings of 5 and 8 July, deputy François Vincent Raspail exposed the blatant violations of the freedom of vote by Bonapartist authorities and accused the church of conducting election propaganda during services, and the police, of overstepping their powers at the time of preparations for the election campaign, when a massacre took place in Paris (see Annales du Sénat et du Corps législatif.
Session extraordinaire du 28 juin au 6 septembre 1869, Paris, 1869, pp.
204-05).
In his message of 12 July Napoleon III promised to expand the Corps' rights and appoint ministers from among deputies, but shirked the issue of the ministry's responsibility, stressing the inviolability of the emperor's power.
On 13 July he postponed the session of the Corps législatif for an indefinite period, and on 17 July introduced into the government a number of persons who suited the big bourgeoisie and the clericals but who did not belong to the opposition.
— 316, 325 389 In a letter of 2 June 1869 Ludwig Kugelmann wrote to Marx that Meissner had assured him that the first signatures of the proofs of Marx's work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (second edition) had already been sent to Marx and that the work would appear in two weeks' time.
— 318 390 In a letter of 6 July 1869, Ludwig Kugelmann suggested to Marx that after the negotiations with Guido Weiß, the editor of Die Zukunft, a short biography of Marx written by Engels for another publication should appear in that newspaper (see also Note 106).
—318, 328, 333 391 On 11 July 1869, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche addressed Marx, on Liebk­ necht's recommendation, as a member of the General Council, to render financial support to the Leipzig cigar-makers' strike.
Wilhelm Liebknecht also approached Marx with a similar request on 7 and 12 July.
In his letter of 14 July Wilhelm Eichhoff enclosed a variety of material about the working-class movement in Germany and informed Marx that he would probably be elected delegate to the Eisenach Congress (see Note 373).
—322, 327 392 On 1 July 1869, the Geneva Central Committee of the German-language sections of the International Working Men's Association passed a resolution published in Der Vorbote in July 1869, which censured Schweitzer's dictatorial behaviour and welcomed the proposal to convene an all-German Social-Democratic Workers' Congress (see Note 373).
In this connection, on 14 July, a piece entitled 'Schwindel' appeared in Der Social-Demohrat , whose author was most probably Fritz Mende.
He accused Johann Philipp Becker as Chairman of the Geneva Central Committee, and the International, of meddling in the affairs of the General Association of German Workers.
—322, 327 393 A reference to Liebknecht's letter to Engels of 11 December 1867, in which he explained the reasons for his cooperation with the German People's Party (see Note 38).
—324 Notes 625 394 On 13 July 1869 Ludwig Kugelmann wrote to Engels about his intention to ask Marx to prolong his stay in Hanover so that they could go to Karlsbad (now Karlovy Vary) for a cure together.
While they were absent, Marx's daughter Jenny was to stay with Gertrud Kugelmann in Hanover.
On 17 July 1869, Kugelmann replied to Marx's letter of 15 July, in which he again asked Marx to go with him to Karlsbad in August.
— 324, 327, 334 395 The reference is to an item published in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
29, 17 July 1869, which stated: 'We can assure you further that the General Council of the International Working Men's Association shares our opinion of Herr von Schweitzer but at present considers it inexpedient to interfere, so as to fully preserve the independence of the German workers' movement.
But if Herr von Schweitzer proves stupid enough to turn up at the forthcoming congress of the International, as he has stated he will do, he will simply be ordered to leave.
'—324, 331 3% Engels is referring to the elections of the President of the united General Association of German Workers in late June 1869 (see Note 363).
The official communication on the results of the elections signed by Mende and published in Der Social-Demokrat on 9 July stated that Schweitzer had been elected by an 'absolute majority' and 'stronger minority' vote.
The latter meant that Mende voted for Schweitzer.
— 324 397 In early April 1814, after the troops of the anti-French coalition invaded Paris, Talleyrand prepared a convocation of the Senate which declared Napoleon I deposed.
In June 1815, after Napoleon I's armies were defeated at Waterloo, the majority of the Chamber of Representatives demanded that he abdicate.

It contained a plan of a working-class organisation.
Becker, who was under Bakunin's influence, refused to recognise the need for a proletarian political party.
He regarded the trade unions as the only acceptable organisational form of workers' movement and sought to put the German Social-Democracy under the control of the Central Committee of the German-language sections.
Marx, Engels and Bebel were sharply critical of this plan.

Bebel's letter was a reply to Marx's letter (not extant) of 27 July 1869 (see this volume, p.
332).
Bebel and Liebknecht supported Marx's critical attitude to Becker's plan for a workers' organisation in Germany (see Note 409) and advocated its formation on the basis of the International's principles.
— 338, 339 415 A reference to the address to the German Social-Democrats 'An die deutschen Sozial-Demokraten' on the convocation of an all-German workers' congress in Eisenach with a view to founding an independent workers' party in Germany.
The address appeared in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
29, 17 July 1869.
It was signed by representatives of workers' societies of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
Among the signatures of the members of the Central Committee of the German Workers' societies in Switzerland was that of petty-bourgeois democrat Amandus Goegg.
This fact gave ground for an article featured by Der Social-Demokrat, No.
84, 21 July 1869, which identified the views of Liebknecht and his followers with those of Goegg.
— 339 416 A reference to the address of the Geneva Central Committee to the Spanish revolutionaries, 'Der Internationale Arbeiterbund von Genf an die Arbeiter Spaniens' issued on 21 October 1868.
It was published as a separate leaflet in German and in French and in Der Vorbote, No.
12, December 1868.

— 341 418 Engels stayed in Ostend and Engelskirchen with relatives from around 19 August to early September 1869.
—342, 352, 357 419 Marx refers to Liebknecht's speech 'Ueber die politische Stellung der Sozial-Demokratie' made at the meeting of the Berlin Democratic Labour Union of 31 May 1869 (see Note 380).
Liebknecht said that August Brass, editor of the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung was willing to give Marx, Engels and himself space in his newspaper to popularise the ideas of socialism and communism, but that he had turned down this proposal.
— 344 420 On Marx's recommendation, Hermann Jung, member of the General Council, evidently attended the meeting of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners which discussed a nominee to the Basle Congress.
On 17 August, Jung informed the General Council that the Society would probably send a representative to the Congress.
This was the Society's General Secretary Robert Applegarth, who, however, carried only a General Council member's man­ date.
—346 421 Engels, Lizzy Burns and Eleanor Marx toured Ireland from 6 to 16 September 1869.
—348, 351, 356 422 A reference to Dupont's statement at the General Council meeting of 17 August 1869, that the Paris bronze-workers had paid off their debt to the London trade unions (see Note 18).
—350 423 Marx quotes Neumayer's letter to the General Council of 14 August 1869.
—350 424 Zabicki made a report on the 1869 strike at woodworking factories and brickworks in Posen at the General Council meeting of 17 August 1869, at which Marx was present.
Zabicki said that 'the building operatives of Posen 628 Notes (Polish) had won their first strike; they had been assisted by the men of Berlin'.
—350 425 Hiltrop's essay mentioned by Engels, 'Ueber die Reorganisation der Knappschaftsvereine', appeared in the Zeitschrift des königlich preussischen statistischen Bureaus, nos.
4, 5 and 6, April, May and June, 1869.
The magazine was edited by Ernst Engel.
Engels examined the rules of the miners' guilds (guild funds) in the coalfields of Saxony on Marx's instruction, and in February 1869 prepared a report on this question for the General Council (see Note 281).
—352 426 On 21 August 1869, Liebknecht reprinted Marx's biography in the Demo­ kratisches Wochenblatt, No.
34.
It was written by Engels and first appeared in Die Zukunft, No.
185, 11 August (see present edition, Vol.
21).
When reprinting the material, Liebknecht omitted the following phrases (printed in italics): 'Everything he [Lassalle —Ed.
] wrote was derived from elsewhere, not without some misunderstandings either; he had a forerunner and an intellectual superior, whose existence he kept a secret, of course, whilst he vulgarised his writings, and the name of that intellectual superior is Karl Marx.
' By way of explanation, Liebknecht wrote to Marx on 17 August 1869, that he had abridged the text since it could 'offend' the Lassalleans if printed in full.
—352 427 The item published by Liebknecht in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
35, 28 August 1869, read: 'It has been decided in Eisenach that alongside with the general party organ (Der Volkstaat, for the present, the Demokratisches Wochenblatt), there should be a press organ for Austria—Die Volkstimme, and for Switzerland, Felleisen' —352 428 Engels refers to the lengthy discussion at the Eisenach Congress (see Note 373) around a name for the party, which involved, among others, the German petty-bourgeois democrat Rittinghausen.
The name agreed upon was the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (Sozial-demokratische Arbeiterpartei).
A report of the Eisenach Congress was published in the Demokratisches Wochenblatt, No.
33, and supplements to nos.
33 and 34, 14 and 21 August 1869.
— 352 429 In the 1860s, in Prussia's Rhine Province, Baden and some other German lands, Catholic priests, including Ketteler, the Bishop of Mainz, launched a campaign for universal suffrage, laws protecting workers' rights, etc.
In this way the Catholic clergy sought to prevent socialist ideas from taking hold of the German workers.
On 6 September 1869, a congress of Catholic communities opened in Düsseldorf, which adopted a resolution 'To demand from all Christians of all estates that they take care of the working class and promote its economic and moral flourishing'.
— 354 430 A reference to the second edition of Marx's work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, which appeared in late July 1869.
In reply to Marx's note, which is not available, Meissner wrote on 28 September 1869 that all copies of Marx's book have been sent off with the exception of the 25 he had.
—354 431 Liebknecht's letter to Marx in which he asked for Engels' work The Peasant War in Germany for reprinting has not come down to us.
There is Liebknecht's letter to Kugelmann of 20 September 1869, in which Liebknecht writes that he intends to reprint this work.
On 20 December, Liebknecht wrote to Engels for permission to reprint the work and to ask for a short introduction to it.
The second edition of The Peasant War in Germany appeared in Leipzig in October 1870.
—354, 356 Notes 629 432 On 26 September 1869, Marx's second daughter Laura Laf argue turned twenty-four.
—355 433 Marx quotes an old German song (c.
1200).
— 355 434 In July 1865, Liebknecht was expelled from the Prussian state by the Berlin police 'for political reasons'.
In 1867, he was elected deputy to the North German Reichstag from Saxony and enjoyed a deputy's immunity.
However, in September 1869, he was unable to visit Marx in Hanover, as the Prussian police had a right to arrest him during a break in the Reichstag work between 22 June 1869 and 14 February 1870.
Marx originally planned a meeting with Liebknecht in Brunswick, and later in Hamburg.
However, the meeting never took place.
—356, 358 435 Marx is referring to Paul Lafargue's letter of 14 September 1869, in which the latter gives an account of the General Council meeting of 14 September, the first after the Basle Congress of the International Working Men's Associa­ tion.
—356, 445 436 Ribbonmen—participants in an Irish peasant movement whose members were united in secret societies and wore a green ribbon as an emblem.
The Ribbonmen movement, which emerged in late 18th century in Northern Ireland, was a form of popular resistance to the arbitrary rule of the English landlords and the forcible eviction of tenants from the land.
The Ribbonmen attacked estates, organised attempts on the lives of hated landlords and managers.
The activities of the Ribbonmen had a purely local, decentralised character; they had no common programme of action.
—357, 549 437 Marx was conducting negotiations with Meissner in Hamburg on 8 and 9 October 1869.
—357 438 Engels first conceived the idea of a book on the history of Ireland in the summer of 1869.
He studied a vast selection of literary and historical sources: works of classical and medieval authors, annals, collections of ancient law codes, legislative acts and legal treatises, folklore, travellers' notes, numerous works on archaeology, history, economics, geography, geology, etc.
Engels' bibliography, embracing over 150 titles, is selective and includes but a fraction of the sources he studied.
Preparatory materials take up the bulk of 15 paginated notebooks of excerpts, as well as notes, fragments on separate sheets and newspaper clippings.
Marx attached great importance to Engels' book and helped him all he could.
The views of Marx and Engels on major problems of Irish history took shape in the course of joint discussions.
In May 1870, Engels began working on it.
Engels actually succeeded in finishing only the first chapter, 'Natural Conditions'.
The second chapter, 'Old Ireland', is unfinished (see present edition, Vol.
21), while the two last chapters were not even begun.
The Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune, which were soon to follow, made Engels concentrate on his work in the International and left him no time for the book.
—357, 358 439 A report of this talk, which touched on the vital issues of the working-class movement, was published by J.
H.
W.
Hamann, member of the delegation, cas­ hier of the metalworkers' union, in Der Volksstaat on 27 November 1869.
Marx spoke about the significance of trade unions as a school of socialism.
He said that in trade unions, workers were getting ready to become socialists, since there they had an opportunity to watch the daily struggle between labour and capital.
630 Notes He emphasised the importance of an independent printed organ for the working-class movement.
'It is a printed organ of trade unions,' said Marx, 'that can serve as a means of the workers' mutual communication; it is there that the "pros" and "contras" must be discussed.
It is necessary to discuss the issue of wages in the different regions, and to collect, as far as this is possible, the opinions of workers in different trades.
However, this printed organ must never become the property of a private individual.
If we want it to fulfil its purpose, it must belong to a collective.
It is probably unnecessary to dwell on the reasons for this attitude, they are so obvious that everyone can be expected to understand: if you wish to see your union flourish, this tenet must be accepted as one of the basic conditions.
' 'The talk ended', wrote Hamann, 'with Marx stressing once more the need never to try to cling to individuals but bear in mind the cause, and draw conclusions only to promote it.
"Be it Liebknecht, be it Dr.
Schweitzer, or be it myself, always think about the cause, for the truth is not to be found outside it.
"' Unfortunately, while recording the conversation, Hamann seriously distorted some of Marx's remarks in the Lassallean spirit, specifically, on the issue of the relationship between the political party of the working class and the trade unions.
(See Internationale wissenschaftliche Korrespondenz zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung, Berlin (W), 1986, Heft 1, S.
63-71).
—358 On Marx's meeting with the delegation of the Brunswick Committee of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party, see Note 447.
— 358 A reference to the French translation of Volume One of Capital made by Charles Keller, member of the Paris Section of the First International.
Keller began the work in October 1869, and on 16 October sent Marx the translation of Chapter II of the first volume for corrections.
Keller took part in the Paris Commune and emigrated to Switzerland after its defeat.
The work remained unfinished.
The translation of Volume One of Capital into French was made by Joseph Roy and published in Paris in 1872-75 in instalments, which were later brought together in a book (on the French translation of Capital, see also Note 309).
—359, 378, 399, 450, 545 Chapter IV of Volume One of Capital (first German edition) corresponds to chapters IV, V and VI of the French edition.
Marx feared that the chapter in its original form would not suit the French readers.

Flerovsky's book The Condition of the Working Class in Russia (H.
OAepoBCKift, lïonoDKeHue paôouaeo wiacca et Pocciu) was sent to Marx by Danielson on 30 September (12 October), 1869.
Danielson expressed the hope that it would supply Marx with the necessary material for the subsequent parts of his classical work Capital.
This work prompted Marx to take up Russian seriously.
(For Marx's opinion of Flerovsky's book see this volume, pp.
390, 423, 424).
— 360, 362, 429 A reference to the atheistic congress (Anticoncilio) convened in Naples on 8 December 1869 by petty-bourgeois democrats who stood close to the League of Peace and Freedom (see Note 271) as a gesture of opposition to the Catholic oecumenical council which was held in Vatican from 8 December 1869 to 20 October 1870, and adopted the dogma of the Pope's infallibility in the matters of faith.
The atheistic congress was broken up by the Neapolitan authorities.
— 362 Pale—the name of an English medieval colony in Ireland established as a result of the seizure by the Anglo-Norman feudal lords of the island's south-eastern part in the 12th century.
The colony, whose boundaries were fortified (hence Notes 631 the name), served as the base for incessant wars against the population of the free part of Ireland which ended in the 16th-17th centuries with the conquest of the entire country.

—363, 365, 522 447 After the Basle Congress (see Note 379), members of the People's Party in Germany (see Note 38) and the Felleisen newspaper, organ of the German workers' unions in Switzerland, launched a campaign against the Congress decisions to abolish private property in land as essentially communist ones.
Seeking to reconcile the People's Party and the petty-bourgeois supporters of Felleisen with the decisions of the Basle Congress, Goegg, its editor-in-chief, made a long statement in Der Volksstaat, No.
3, 9 October 1869, in which he attempted to belittle the revolutionary importance of Congress decisions.
He declared that there was nothing communist about them.
Marx is apparently referring to this statement as 'Goeggiana'.
At that time, Liebknecht and Der Volksstaat, fearing that a break with the petty-bourgeois democratic elements in the South-German states might occur, refrained from a large-scale popularisation campaign of the Basle decisions to convert the land into public property; Der Volksstaat repeatedly stated that these decisions were applicable only in Britain, where large landed property existed, and were unsuitable either for Germany or France, where small peasant holdings predominated.
Liebknecht believed that the party approval of the Basle decisions would be premature and could have prompted the proletarian supporters of the South-German People's Party to depart from the Social-Democratic Workers' Party.
This tactic met with disapproval on the part of his associates and soon Liebknecht himself became convinced that it was erroneous, and began actively to popularise Basle Congress decisions.
On 3 October 1869, at a meeting with Marx in Hanover (see Marx's letter to Engels of 30 September 1869), members of the Central Committee Bonhorst, Bracke and Spier discussed the possibility of implementing the Basle Congress decisions and the tactics of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party in Germany with respect to the peasantry.
On 25 October Bonhorst wrote a letter to Marx requesting him to give as clear an account of the matter as possible in order to use it to organise a popularisation campaign among German peasants (see Note 453).
This letter from Bonhorst was forwarded by Marx to Engels.
— 363 448 Marx learned that Bakunin had the writings of A.
A.
Serno-Solovyevich, who committed suicide on 16 August 1869, from L'Egalité, No.
37, 1 October 1869, which carried an announcement requesting all persons in possession of manuscripts, letters and other documents of the deceased to submit them for the use of the newspaper, which was intending to publish his works and compile a bibliography.
— 364, 366 449 Marx refers, specifically, to the article by Hermann Greulich 'Die Heulmaierei gegen den Basler Kongress' published in Der Volksstaat, No.
5, 16 October 1869.
—364 450 By '(he antiquated manner of 1789' Marx means the transfer to the peasants of the land confiscated from the feudal lords (parcelling) at the time of the French Revolution.
Marx and Engels believed that this way of dealing with the agrarian problem was unsuitable for the proletarian party, leading as it did to the establishment of a petty-bourgeois peasant class and dooming the peasantry to gradual impoverishment and ruin (see K.
Marx and F.
Engels, 'Address of 632 Notes the Central Authority to the League, March 1850', present edition, Vol.
10, pp.
284-85).
—364 451 The Land and Labour League was founded in London in October 1869 with the participation of the General Council.
Its Executive Committee included more than ten General Council members.
The League's programme was drawn up by Eccarius on Marx's instruction and edited by Marx (see Vol.
21, pp.
401-06).
Along with general democratic demands, like the reform of the finance and tax system and of public education, it contained demands for the nationalisation of the land and the reduction of working hours, as well as the Chartist demands for universal suffrage and home colonisation.
Marx held that the League could play a role in revolutionising the English working class and could promote the establishment of an independent proletarian party in England.
However, by the autumn of 1870, the influence of bourgeois elements had grown in the League and it gradually began to lose contact with the International.
— 364, 375, 377, 412 452 In the summer and autumn of 1869, a mass movement developed in Ireland for an amnesty of the Fenian prisoners (see Note 86).
In 1867, the Fenians were preparing an armed uprising; in September of that year, the British authorities managed to arrest the leaders of the Fenian movement and put them on trial.
The Fenians were persecuted, their newspapers were closed down, and the operation of the Habeas Corpus Act suspended (see Note 486).
The campaign for the defence of the convicted Fenians launched in England was supported by the General Council of the First International.
Numerous meetings presented petitions to the British Government demand­ ing that the Irish revolutionaries be released, but Prime Minister Gladstone refused to meet these demands.
On 24 October 1869, a mass demonstration in defence of the Fenians took place in London (for an account of the event, see this volume, pp.
546-47), after which the General Council resolved to address the English people in defence of the Fenians, and set up a special commission consisting of Marx, Lucraft, Jung and Eccarius.
On Marx's suggestion, the issue was expanded, and in November 1869 the General Council held a broad discussion on the attitude of the British Government to the Irish prisoners.
Marx spoke twice (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
407-12), and wrote a 'Draft Resolution of the General Council on the Policy of the British Government Towards the Irish Prisoners' (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
83, and this volume, p.
375), which was approved by the General Council on 30 November 1869.
—365, 449, 546 453 In a letter to Marx of 25 October 1869 (see Note 447), Bonhorst wrote: 'You should know better than anyone what the sore spot of the German peasant is.
If we promise him to operate on that spot, he will be all for us.
Thus, I believe, .

the mortgages may provide a wonderful opportunity.
Just as raising the fertility of the soil.
Insurance based on reciprocity.
The ability to compete with the large estates.

'—365 454 A reference to the destruction on 16 October 1869, by order of the Prussian military authorities and against court ruling, of the monument to the citizens of Celle (Hanover) who took part in the Langesalza (Thuringia) battle against the Prussians on 27 June 1866, at the time of the Austro-Prussian war, in which Hanover fought on the side of Austria.
The Prussians had been defeated.
War Minister Roon stated during the discussion of this issue in the Prussian Landtag: 'Prussia is a military state, and the military authorities in Celle only Notes 633 executed their inalienable supreme right' (see Der Volksstaat, No.
11, 6 November 1869).
—366, 371 455 A reference to the issue of The Bee-Hive of 30 October 1869 (No.
420), which featured the editorial 'Ministers and the Fenian Prisoners'.
It vindicated the policies pursued by Gladstone with regard to the Irish national liberation movement.
—366 456 A strike of spinners in Bolton caused by reduction of wages by 5 per cent and the overall deterioration of the workers' conditions due to an industrial slump lasted from 29 October to 4 November 1869 and ended in defeat for the workers.
— 367 457 The reference is apparently to the article 'Unser Redakteur' published in Der Pionier, No.
42, 13 October 1869, which attacked Marx's Capital.
— 367 458 Liebknecht's inconsistent behaviour when popularising the decisions of the Basle Congress (see Note 447) was used by Schweitzer, who in a series of provocative articles in Der Social-Demokrat accused the Eisenachers of deceiving the workers, denouncing a socialist programme, and toeing the line of the People's Party (see Note 38).
Bonhorst responded with an article 'Der famose Diktator und eine der Braunschweiger "Strohpuppen" im Lichte der Baseler Besch­ lüsse', in which he made it clear that the Lassallean General Association of German Workers only paid lip service to socialist principles while in fact doing nothing to implement them.
Schweitzer, Bonhorst wrote, will never manage to pass himself off as a champion of the rural proletariat's interests, for he enjoys the support of the Prussian junkers.
The attacks of the democra­ tic press on the resolutions of the Basle Congress, he stated by way of conclusion, only serve to show where the dividing line lies between the Social-Democratic Party and its fellow-travellers in the People's Party.
The article appeared in Der Volksstaat, Nos.
8 and 9, 27 and 30 October 1869.
— 367, 369.
459 Bonhorst was arrested in Magdeburg on 27 October 1869, on the charge of agitating against the Prussian Government, and was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment.
— 367 460 On 6 November 1869, a ceremony of the opening of Blackfriars Bridge and Holborn Viaduct was held in London.
Queen Victoria was present.
—367 461 Repealers—people campaigning for a repeal of the Anglo-Irish Union of 1801 imposed upon Ireland by the British Government after the suppression of the Irish uprising of 1798.
The Union, which came into force on 1 January 1801, put an end to the autonomy of Ireland and abolished the Irish Parliament.
One of the consequences of its introduction was the abolition of tariffs established by the Irish Parliament at the end of the 18th century to protect the rising Irish industry, and this led to its total decline.
Since the 1820s, the movement for the repeal of the Union began to gain momentum in Ireland.
However, its bourgeois liberal leadership (O'Connell and others) regarded the campaign only as a means to wrest insignificant concessions for the Irish bourgeoisie from the British Government.
Under the impact of the mass movement, the liberals were forced to found the Repealer Association (1840), and they attempted to make it agree to a compromise with the British ruling classes.
—368, 390, 398, 473 462 Arthur O'Connor, a prominent member of the Irish national liberation movement, was a leader of the secret revolutionary organisation, the United 23-983 634 Note Irishmen, whose goal was to establish an independent Irish republic.
In May and June 1798, the members of the United Irishmen staged an uprising against the British rule.
O'Connor and other leaders were arrested on the eve of the uprising.
The uprising was brutally suppressed (see Note 461).
— 368, 398 463 Marx ironically likens Freiligrath to the manufacturer Classen-Kappelmann, member of the Cologne city council, who became a notorious figure in 1865.
In July 1865 he took part in the preparation of a banquet for the Party of Progress members who were deputies of the Chamber of Representatives of the Prussian Landtag in opposition to the Prussian Government.
The banquet was banned and Classen-Kappelmann, who feared arrest, left for Belgium.
The guests arrived to find the premises closed and assembled at the Zoo.
The assembly was dispersed by the police.
— 371 464 Marx refers to the circular letter to the French electors drawn up by Ledru-Rollin, participant in the 1848-49 revolution, who lived in London as an emigre up to 1870.
Describing it as that of a pretender, Marx alludes to the fact that in the Presidential elections in France on 10 December 1848, Ledru-Rollin nominated himself as a representative of petty-bourgeois democrats.
His letter, dated 7 November 1869, was published in Le Réveil on 10 November under the heading 'Aux électeurs'.
— 371 465 The original of this letter is kept in the archives of the Greater London Library (Greater London Council).

Under the amnesty, a number of Poles sentenced to less than twenty years' imprisonment were able to return home.
— 377 474 The Guelphic conspiracy—a reference to the events that developed after the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 in Hanover, which lost its independence and was annexed by Prussia.
The former King of Hanover, George V, who strove for the restoration of the Guelph dynasty, set up the so-called Guelph Legion in France in the spring of 1867.
It comprised mostly émigrés from Hanover.
On 8 April 1868, the Prussian legal bodies sentenced a number of officers who had taken part in its foundation to ten years' imprisonment.
However, seeking to consolidate its position in Hanover, the Prussian Government announced an amnesty of the rank-and-file members early in May that year.

—383 478 Marx is referring to the General Council meeting of 23 November 1869, which continued the discussion of the policies of the British Government with respect to the Irish political prisoners (see notes 452 and 468).
— 386 479 Engels is referring to an armed uprising staged in the spring of 1867 by the Irish revolutionaries, the Fenians (see notes 86 and 452).
The British authorities, who had been informed that preparations for an uprising were under way, easily suppressed the isolated outbursts.
Many Fenian leaders were arrested and tried.
— 387 480 Chetham Library—the oldest library in Manchester, founded in 1653.
Marx worked there together with Engels in 1845 during his first stay in England.
— 388, 402, 518 481 Brehon Law, the general name of the Celtic common law code, took its name from the Brehons, judges in Celtic Ireland.
The laws operated in Ireland until 1605, when they were repealed by the British Government.
Their publication was started by the Brehon Law Commission set up by the British Government in 1852.
The first three volumes of the Ancient Laws of Ireland appeared in 1865, 1869 and 1873 and made up the collection The Senchus Mor, or Great Old Law Book.
The publication continued up to 1901.
—388, 409, 442, 451, 509, 519 482 J.
Davies, Historical Tracts, London, 1787.
Engels sets forth the contents of two of Davies' tracts, 'A letter from Sir John Davies to Robert Earl of Salisbury, 636 Notes 1607', and 'A letter from Sir John Davies to Robert Earl of Salisbury concerning the State of Ireland, 1610'.
—388 483 Engels is referring to the speech made by Napoleon III on 29 November 1869, at the opening of an extraordinary session of the French National Assembly (published on 30 November in the Journal des Débats and other French newspapers), and the speeches of Prévost-Paradol in Edinburgh during his tour of Britain in November 1869 (published in the British press and in a number of French papers, including the Journal des Débats on 16 and 18 November 1869).

—389 485 At the time of the English Revolution an uprising broke out in Ireland which resulted in the Catholic part of the island splitting with England.
The uprising was suppressed in 1649-52.
The 'pacification' of Ireland was executed with the utmost brutality and ended in the mass transfer of land to the new English landlords; this strengthened the landowner and bourgeois strata and paved the way for the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.
— 391 486 A writ of Habeas Corpus—the name given in English judicial procedure to a document enjoining the appropriate authorities to present an arrested person before court on the demand of the persons interested to check the legitimacy of the arrest.
Having considered the reasons for the arrest, the court either frees the arrested person, sends him back to prison or releases him on bail or guarantee.
The procedure, laid down by an Act of Parliament of 1679, does not apply to persons accused of high treason and can be suspended by decision of Parliament.
The British authorities frequently made use of this exception in Ireland.
—391, 394, 419 487 At one of the sittings of the Prussian Landtag, Minister for the Interior Count von Eulenburg made a statement justifying the violations of the law by the Prussian military authorities in Celle (see Note 454).
—391 488 This is Marx's reply to Kugelmann's request to give him the address of E.
Reich, to whom Kugelmann was going to send Volume One of Capital.
Reich's book Ueber die Entartung des Menschen, ihre Ursachen und Verhütung (Erlangen, 1868) was given by Kugelmann to Marx during the latter's stay in Germany in September and October 1869.
The Introduction to the book is marked 'Gotha, 5.
Mai 1868'.
—391 489 An excerpt from this letter was first published in English in: The Labour Monthly, Vol.
15, No.
1, London, 1933.
—392, 394, 396 490 Marx refers to the reports of the General Council meetings of 16 and 23 November 1869, at which he made a speech on the policies of the British Government with regard to the Irish prisoners (see present edition, Vol.
21).
The reports were written for the press by two General Council members, Eccarius ('The British Government and the Irish Political Prisoners', in: The Reynolds's Newspaper, nos.
1006 and 1008, 21 November and 5 December 1869) and Harris ('International Working Men's Association', in: The National Reformer, 28 November and 5 December 1869).
By Harris' 'currency panacea', Marx means his article 'Yours or Mine; or Short Chapters, Showing the True Basis of Property and the Causes of its Unequal Distribution' in: The National Reformer, 5 December 1869.
The Reynolds's Notes 637 Newspaper and The National Reformer were published on Saturday but were dated Sunday; that is why the Sunday 5 December issue of The National Reformer was sent by Marx to Engels on Saturday, 4 December.
— 392, 394 491 A reference to the second issue ('the attitude of the British working class to the Irish question') in the discussion on Ireland in the General Council (see this volume, pp.
371-72).
Marx had proposed to open it on 7 December 1869, but was unable to attend on account of an illness.
The General Council never took up the issue again.
Marx expounded his views on the position of the British working class with regard to Ireland in his letter to Engels of 10 December 1869 (see this volume, p.
398) and in the circular letter 'The General Council to the Federal Council of Romance Switzerland' (present edition, Vol.
21).
— 392 492 After the defeat of the 1867 armed uprising in Ireland (see Note 479), many Fenians were arrested and tried.
On 18 September 1867 in Manchester, the Fenians made an armed attack on a prison van in an attempt to liberate Kelly and Deasy, two of their leaders.
Five Irishmen captured on the spot were sentenced to death, which triggered off a wave of protests in Ireland and England.
Members of the General Council also voiced their protest.
Seeking to work out a coordinated tactic of the proletariat in the national question and to popularise the ideas of proletarian internationalism among English workers, Marx persuaded the General Council to hold a public discussion of the Irish question to which representatives of the Irish and English press were to be invited.
The discussion began on 19 November, and on 20 November, at an extraordinary meeting, the General Council adopted the petition 'The Fenian Prisoners at Manchester and the International Working Men's Association' (see present edition, Vol.
21).
This is the document that Marx mentions in a letter to Engels.
— 392.
493 Marx's letter to Robert Applegarth of 1 December 1869 has not been found.
—393 494 Marx is referring to Robert Applegarth's letter to him of 2 December 1869: 'Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, General Office.
113 Stamford Street, Waterloo Road, S.
E.
London, Dec 2d 1869 'My dear Marx, 'Your note is just to hand.
'I have not replied to the enquiries—made as to whether I voted for Common property in Land and I don't intend doing so till I hear from you.
'I send you a copy of the question put to me.
' "Was any resolution passed to which you were, or were not a party, against all private property in land?" 'The above is the question and the first words of my reply will be.
' "A resolution was passed declaring 'That society has a right to abolish private property in land and to convert it into common property and that there was a necessity for doing so'.
And for this resolution I gave my vote most cordially.
" 'I then want to say in a few words why Land ought to be made common property.
'I would not have troubled you had I been asked the question only as reference to some opinion I had expressed apart from the International but as 638 Notes my reply will be placed in the hands of those who would by one means or another have to disgorge their ill gotten acres, if land was made common property and as my vote was given at one of our Congresses I feel I ought to ask the advice of those who understood the question thoroughly before I was born.
'I shall therefore wait till I hear from you.
'I am yours truly 'R.
Applegarth'.
—393, 395 495 Marx's letter to R.
Applegarth of 3 December 1869, has not been found.
—393 496 In a letter to Marx of 11 November 1869, Wilhelm Bracke noted that the arrest of Leonard von Bonhorst had created additional difficulties for the Committee of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (see Note 459).
Bonhorst was Secretary of the Brunswick Party Committee.
—393, 395 497 fhe demand for the repeal of the Union (see Note 461) had been the most popular slogan in Ireland since the 1820s.
—394 498 A reference to the letter from Klein and Moll to Engels of 3 December 1869.
They wrote about the financial difficulties encountered by the Solingen cooperative for the production of steel and iron goods (see Note 330) and requested Engels for assistance.
Inscribed on the letter in Engels' hand is: 'Answered on 8 February 1870.
Fifty thaler sent by registered mail, with the interest to be added to the cooperative's reserve fund'.
— 395, 396, 420 499 On 30 November 1869, at a sitting of the Corps législatif, bourgeois republican Jules Favre made an inquiry into illegal actions by the government, including postponement of the Corps' assemblies and interference of the authorities in the elections to the Corps in May and June 1869.
Particularly scandalous facts were revealed at the sitting of 7 December at which deputy Durand's mandate was being confirmed.
Minister for the Interior Forcade-Laroquette spoke in defence of Durand.
The proposal to hold an investigation into the results of the vote on Durand's candidature was advanced by Jules Favre.
Liberal deputies who belonged to the oppositional parliamentary group of French bourgeoisie, the so-called third party, did not support Jules Favre and abstained from voting.
Jules Favre's proposal was rejected by 135 votes to 86.
-395 500 xhe toast to Marx and Engels as editors of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung was proposed by Karl Klein in May 1864 in Cologne on the occasion of the anniversary celebration of the General Association of German Workers in the presence of Ferdinand Lassalle.
—397 501 Marx is referring to his contributions to the New-York Daily Tribune (in 1851-62).
See, for instance, Marx's essays 'Forced Emigration.
—Kossuth and Mazzini.
—The Refugee Question.
—Election Bribery in England.
—Mr.
Cobden' published in the spring of 1853 in that newspaper (present edition, Vol.
11, pp.
528-34).
—398 502 Engels proposed to include the section 'Rebellion and Union.
1780-1801' into the chapter 'English Rule' (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
307).
Marx's recommenda­ tion to Engels that he should write a separate chapter on the period from 1779 to 1800 for his book on Irish history (see Note 438) was based on his own research.
Marx prepared excerpts on Irish history from 1776 to 1801.
— 398 503 Marx is probably alluding to the presence of Empress Eugénie Montijo at a session of the French Cabinet of Ministers of 9 December 1869, which pro-Notes 639 voked deep indignation among the liberal and democratic opposition in Paris.
— 399 504 A fragment of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Marx and Engels, On the United States, Moscow, 1979.
—401 505 Engels probably means the English edition of the book by W.
Camden Britannia or Chorographical Description of the most flourishing Kingdoms England, Scotland and Ireland and the Islands adjoining, London, 1637.
The book, originally written in Latin, was published in 1590 as one volume with another work by Camden, Hiberniae et insularum Britanniae adiacentium descriptio, which Engels ascribed, apparently erroneously, to Giraldus Cambrensis.
In his further work on the history of Ireland (see Note 438), Engels used the publication (in Latin) Giraldi Cambrensis Opera, ed.
J.
S.
Brewer, London, Longmans, 1863.
Expugnatio was included in Vol.
V of this edition, which was published in 1867 (see Note 528), and also appeared in the English translation published by Bohn in London in 1863, The Historical Works of Giraldus Cambrensis.
—402 506 Probably an error in the text; the first edition of Robert Kane's The Industrial Resources of Ireland appeared in 1844, and the second—in 1845 in Dublin.
Engels probably refers to the latter.
—402 507 Having failed to move to the forefront in the International's leadership at the Basle Congress (see Note 379), Bakunin altered his tactics and launched an open campaign against the General Council.
His followers came to form the majority in L'Egalité weekly published in Switzerland, and as early as 6 November 1869, No.
42 carried an editorial 'Le Bulletin du Conseil Général', accusing the General Council of violating articles 2 and 3 of the Regulations on the publication of an information bulletin dealing with the conditions of workers in various countries.
On 13 November, No.
43 published another article, 'L'Organisation de l'Internationale', which proposed the establishment of a federal council for England, allegedly to make it easier for the General Council to manage the more general affairs of the International.
On 27 November, No.
45 featured an article 'Les Parties Politiques à Genève et l'Internationale', which suggested abstention from politics, and on 11 December, L'Égalité No.
47 lashed out against the Council's position on the Irish question in the editorial entitled 'Réflexions'.
Le Progrès newspaper, which was published in Switzerland, assumed a similarly critical stand.
The question of L'Egalité and Le Progrès was discussed at the General Council for the first time at a meeting of 14 December 1869.
On 1 January 1870, an extraordinary Council meeting approved a circular letter, drawn up by Marx, 'The General Council to the Federal Council of Romance Switzerland', which was sent out to the International's sections (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
84).
—404, 411, 489, 492 508 A reference to a resolution of the Basle Congress adopted on 9 September 1869, on the procedure of settling conflicts between the International's sections.
(See 'Report of the Fourth Annual Congress of the International Working Men's Association', London [1869], p.
21.
) It is included in the work of Marx and Engels Fictitious Splits in the International.
Private Circular from the General Council of the International Working Men's Association (present edition, Vol.
23).
— 404, 480 509 Marx is referring to the Resolution of the Geneva Congress of the International on publishing a bulletin (in; Rules and Administrative Regulations of 640 Notes the International Working Men's Association, London [1867], Articles 2, 3, present edition, Vol.

— 405 510 Marx is referring to the Central Committee of the German-language sections in Switzerland headed by J.
Ph.
Becker.
Since November 1865, it was the organisational centre for the sections of German-language workers not only in Switzerland but in Germany, Austria and the countries where German workers were living in emigration.
— 405 511 On 5 January 1870, Marx was a member of the General Council delegation to the funeral of Robert Shaw, a house-painter and member of the Genera] Council.
The obituary Marx had written on the instruction of the Council was published in the Belgian newspaper L'Internationale, No.
53, 16 January 1870 (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
92).
—406 512 The report to the Belgian Federal Council written by Marx as a temporary Corresponding Secretary for Belgium is not extant.
It had been forwarded to De Paepe through Hins alongside a copy of the circular letter 'The General Council to the Federal Council of Romance Switzerland' (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
84) and Robert Shaw's obituary (see Note 511).
—406, 411, 414 513 Engels left for Barmen to visit his mother in late December 1869, and returned to Manchester on 6 January, 1870.
— 407, 548 514 Apparently a reference to Ollivier's liberal ministry's assuming office in France on 2 January 1870.
In Germany, this event was regarded as a step towards normalising relations between France and the North German Confederation.
— 407 515 Engels refers to Fritz Mende's book Herr J.
B.
von Schweitzer und die Organisation des Lassalle'schen Allgemeinen] deutschen Arbeitervereins, Leipzig, 1869.
Mende headed a small group of Lassalleans who had split off from the General Association of German Workers (see Note 104) under the influence of Sophie von Hatzfeldt and formed the Lassallean General Association of German Workers in 1867.
In 1872, it virtually ceased to exist.
—408 516 On 10 January 1870, Prince Pierre Napoléon Bonaparte murdered Victor Noir, a reporter on the republican newspaper La Marseillaise, in his house.
Noir visited Pierre Napole'on as a second of the Blanquist Pascal Grousset, also a La Marseillaise reporter, who had challenged the prince to a duel.
The murder was committed a few days after the coming into office of Ollivier's liberal ministry, which the liberal bourgeoisie expected to introduce a number of reforms.
The murder of Noir provoked an outburst of indignation in democratic quarters and bolstered the republican movement in France.
— 409, 423, 553 517 Prévost-Paradol's article was published on Monday, 17 January 1870, in the Journal des Débats,— 409 518 A reference to the speech by John Bright, Minister of Trade in Gladstone's liberal government, made at Birmingham on 11 January.
It was published by The Times on 12 January 1870.
—409 519 Marx read in .
Russian Herzen's book Prison and Exile (London, 1854; published under the pen-name of Iskander) which belonged to Engels and contained his Notes 641 marginal notes.
On page 196 Marx wrote: 'Finished 9 January 1870'.
The copy is kept at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.
— 411 520 In a letter of 20 December 1869, Liebknecht asked Engels for permission to reprint his work The Peasant War in Germany (see present edition, Vol.
10, pp.
397-482) in Der Volksstaat, and subsequently as a separate pamphlet.
He also asked for a short preface to the work.
Liebknecht's letter of 8 February 1870 shows that Engels had given his consent.
The preface (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
93) and five chapters appeared in Der Volksstaat between 2 April and 25 June 1870; in October 1870 the work was published as a pamphlet.
—411, 417, 425 521 Land.
League—a reference to the Land Tenure Reform Association founded in July 1869 on the initiative of John Stuart Mill.
Its stated purpose was to restore the small peasantry by renting plots of land to the unemployed.
—412 522 Marx intended to expound the issues of landed property and rent in the third book of Volume Two of Capital, but altered the original plan in the course of his work.
The manuscript of the third book of Capital was written in 1864-65.
After Volume One of Capital appeared in 1867, Marx did a great deal of work collecting new material about landed property in Belgium and a number of other European and American countries.
However, it did not allow him to re-write the section on land rent.
Later, Engels included the part on landed property into Volume Three of Capital.
For details, see Engels' preface to Volume Three of Capital (present edition, Vol.
37).
—412 523 rje paepe listed the works on landed property in Belgium in a letter to Marx of 1 February 1870.
—412 524 A reference to Hins' letter to Stepney of 21 January 1870, which was forwarded to Marx by Eccarius on 27 January 1870.
—412, 424, 431 525 Even before the Romance Federal Council had received the circular letter 'The General Council to the Federal Council of Romance Switzerland' (see Note 507), it managed to change the composition of the editorial board of L'Égalité.
After the Bakuninists had withdrawn, the newspaper began to support the policy of the General Council.
The report on the withdrawal of seven members from L'Egalité editorial board ('Aux sections romands') appeared in the newspaper on 8 January 1870, No.
2 and on 15 January the next issue (No.
3) carried a statement by the editors themselves.
It was signed, among others, by J.
Ph.
Becker, who prior to April 1870 vacillated in his attitude to the Bakuninists.
Soon, however, he went back on his decision to withdraw.
—412, 430 526 The private letter from Perret to Jung mentioned here was dated 4 January 1870, like the official letter.
The excerpt that follows has also been preserved as a copy made by Marx's daughter Jenny.
The last passage of the excerpt was copied by Marx.
—413 527 Later, in his letter to Hermann Jung of 15 April 1870 Henri Perret gave a detailed account of the incident.
James Guillaume's father was secretary of the State Council in Neuchâtel, and it was he who signed Martinaud's mandate.
— 413 528 In 1863, Volume III of Giraldus Cambrensis' complete works was pub­ lished (Giraldi Cambrensis Opera, voluminis I-VII, Londini, 1861-1877).
Volu­ mes I-IV were brought out by J.

Brewer, and volumes V-VII—by James F.
Dimock.
642 Notes His works Expugnatio Hibernica and Topographia Hibernica were included in Volume V, which appeared in 1867.
(See also this volume, p.
402).
—416 529 On 20 January 1870, at an electors' meeting in Berlin, bourgeois democrat Johann Jacoby, deputy of the Prussian Landtag, made a speech on the goals of the labour movement, in which he said, among other things: 'From the viewpoint of a future historian of culture, the emergence of the tinies workers' association will be of more value than the Battle of Sadowa'.
On 23 January, having received a report of the meeting, Kugelmann wrote to Jacoby: 'Why, making references to Aristotle, de Maistre, Owen, von Gentz and John Stuart Mill do you ignore the name of Karl Marx, a researcher compared to whom all the above-mentioned, with the exception of Aristotle, are mere pygmies, a thinker who can by right be called the brain of the 19th century; whose teaching you have not only failed "to develop further" but the other way round, .
.
.
his epoch-making works, specifically, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Capital, have provided you with the most significant material.
' On 24 January, Jacoby wrote to Kugelmann acknowledging Marx's indisputable merits; still he tried to justify himself, saying that his popular exposition required no specific references.
These letters of Kugelmann's and Jacobi's were forwarded by Marx to Engels.
—417 530 xhe first attempt to translate Marx's book The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte into French was made by Keller in December 1869, who interrupted his work on the French translation of Capital (see Note 441).
Keller's work remained unfinished.
On the first publication of the book in French see Note 303.
—419 531 Engels is referring to the German translation of the work by P.
Lilienfeld Land and Freedom (AnAHeHcfeAb/t, 3eMJin u eonn), which appeared in St.
Petersburg in 1868.
The translation, 'Land und Freiheit', was published in: J.
Eckardt, Russlands ländische Zustände seit Aufhebung der Leibeigenschaft, Leipzig, 1870.
— 419, 426 532 A reference to the revolutionary events that took place in Elberfeld in May 1849.
The city Committee of Public Safety appointed Engels supervisor of all works to build defensive works and barricades, and commander of the artillery.
Local bourgeoisie, who feared that Engels' authority might become too great, demanded that the Committee issued an order for his arrest.
The Solingen workers, with whom Engels had arrived in Elberfeld, and also the workers of Elberfeld were outraged by the bourgeoisie's behaviour and resolutely rose to his defence.
Unwilling to be the cause of a split in the insurgents' camp, Engels left Elberfeld for Cologne on 15 May.
He gave a detailed account of these events in his report 'Elberfeld' to the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, No.
300, 17 May 1849 (see present edition, Vol.
9, pp.
447-49), and in his work 'The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution' (see present edition, Vol.
10, pp.
159-71).
—420 533 A reference to the arrest of Rochefort on 7 February 1870, in La Villette, a workers' suburb of Paris, for his article about Victor Noir's murder (see Note 516) published by La Marseillaise, 12 January 1870.
White smocks was a name for French police agents.
In June 1869, the Police Prefecture of Paris made an attempt to provoke a spontaneous outburst among the workers using the 'white smocks' who staged manifestations, built barricades, sang the Marseillaise, etc.
Engels expressed his apprehensions that similar provocations would be staged after Rochefort's arrest.

—423, 426 536 A reference to Perret's letter-to Jung of 4 January 1870.
It was quoted by Marx in his letter to De Paepe, 24 January 1870 (see this volume, p.
413).
— 424, 426 537 Marx is referring to an item that appeared in La Marseillaise on 2 February 1870, and was inspired by Blind.
It dealt with the fact that in 1849, Blind was unlawfully arrested in France and put into prison, although as an official representative of the revolutionary Baden government he enjoyed diplomatic immunity.
The item contained a demand for an amnesty for Blind as an alleged former member of the German National Assembl) and a diplomatic representative of the Frankfurt Parliament.
In actual fact, Karl Blind and Jacob Friedrich Schütz (Blind wrote Schurz, since that name was better known belonging as it did to a Brigadier General of the Northern States of America, subsequently the American Secretary for Home Affairs) had never been members of the National Assembly.
Schütz had been sent to Paris as a chargé d'affaires of the Palatinate to establish diplomatic relations with France, buy munitions, and recruit commanding officers.
On the German National Assembly, see Note 256.
—425 538 Engels is referring to Wilhelm Liebknecht's letter of 8 February 1870.
To explain why he did not know about the publication of the second edition of Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (see present edition, Vol.
11, pp.
99-197), Liebknecht wrote that Otto Meissner had not informed either Der Volksstaat or Die Zukunft about this, and as he put it, 'a week ago, I did not know for sure if the book had appeared'.
—426, 428 539 A reference to the article by Alfred Naquet featured by La Marseillaise, No.

—426 540 A reference to Bouverie's speech in the House of Commons on 10 February 1870, in connection with the proposal of the government to deprive O'Donovan Rossa of the right to attend its sessions (see Note 466).
His speech was published by The Times on 11 February 1870, in a report on the session.
—429 541 Marx is referring to a group of Russian political refugees from among the young intellectuals, followers of the noted Russian revolutionary democrats Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov.
In the spring of 1870, they founded the Russian Section of the First International in Geneva.
A substantial contribution to its organisation had been made by A.
A.
Serno-Solovyevich, a member of the International, who died in 1869.
On 12 March 1870, the Committee of the Section sent the General Council its Programme, Rules, and a letter to Marx requesting him to be their representative at the General Council.
The programme of the Russian Section defined its objectives as follows: '1.
To popularise the ideas and principles of the International Association in Russia by 644 Notes every possible rational means, whose special character and mode of influence stem from the very position of the country.
2.
To promote the establishment of international sections among Russian workers.
3.
To help establish stable, mutual contacts between the working classes of Russia and Western Europe, including assistance to each other in order to more successfully attain their common goal, emancipation.
' This document, and the official reply of the General Council written by Marx, 'The General Council of the International Working Men's Association to Committee Members of the Russian Section in Geneva' (see present edition, Vol.

At its meeting of 22 March 1870, the General Council admitted the Russian Section to the International, and Marx agreed to represent it at the General Council.
The Section rendered Marx and Engels substantial assistance in counteracting the Bakuninists' attempts to split the International.
Members of the Russian Section, including Nikolai Utin, Anton Trusov, Yekaterina Barteneva, Victor Bartenev, Yelena Dmitriyeva, and Anna Korvin-Krukovskaya, took an active part in the Swiss and international working class movement.
The Section made an attempt to establish contacts with the revolutionarv movement in Russia.
Its work was terminated in 1872.

—431 543 A reference to the events connected with the decision of the French National Assembly to withdraw Rochefort's deputy's mandate for his appeal to rise against the Empire after the murder of Victor Noir, reporter from La Marseillaise, by Prince Pierre Napoléon Bonaparte (see notes 516 and 553).
Flourens was an organiser of meetings and assemblies for the defence of Rochefort.
One of such meetings was to be held on 7 February 1870, on the premises of La Marseillaise editorial offices, but Rochefort was arrested when entering the room.
The initiative passed to Flourens, who immediately announced that the government had been overthrown, and declared uninterrupted revolution.
Assisted by those present, he arrested the police commissary present at the meeting, led the people out into the street, and they made for Belleville.
Sixty people actually got there.
Flourens hoped to use the assistance of a number of junior officers to seize arms at the Prince Eugene's barracks and the Belleville Theatre, where rifles were kept.
However, Flourens' plan fell through.
The liaison men failed in their task and workers did not come to the assistance, and in the end only Flourens and one young man remained at the barricade, leaving it late at night.
By morning, it was taken by soldiers.
—431 544 Engels is referring to the Irish Land Bill, which was discussed in the British Parliament in the first half of 1870.
Submitted by Gladstone on 15 February 1870 for the British Government on the pretext of assisting Irish tenants, it contained so many provisos and restrictions that it actually left the basis of big landownership by the English landlords in Ireland intact.
It also preserved their right to raise rents and to drive tenants off the land, stipulating only that the landlords pay compensation to the tenants for land improvement, and instituting a definite judicial procedure for this.
The Land Act was passed in Notes 645 August 1870.
The landlords sabotaged the implementation of the Act in every way and found loopholes in it.
The Act greatly promoted the concentration of farms in Ireland into big estates and the ruination of small Irish tenants.

—437 550 On 8 March 1870, using its right of an arbiter in conflicts between the International's sections (see Note 508), the General Council examined the Sub-Committee's report and ruled on the conflict that had emerged in Lyons between the old Lyons Section represented by Schettel and other persons who stood close to Left-wing republicans, and the group headed by the Bakuninist Albert Richard.
The General Council found the accusations groundless, and approved Richard's appointment as Corresponding Secretary of the Interna­ tional Working Men's Association.
The statement made by the General Council stressed the need to be careful and avoid personal animosities fraught with conflict, and to concentrate all the strength and all the energy for the speedy triumph of the principles of the International Working Men's Association.

Among others, the newspaper featured letters from Rochefort, Raul Rigo, O'Donovan Rossa, and a posthumous letter from Victor Noir.
The headline opening O'Donovan Rossa's letter read: 'Letter of the Citizen O'Donovan Rossa, Fenian deputy to the British Parliament, condemned to the galleys and held at the Newgate Prison'.

Their authors thanked Engels for the 50 thaler he had sent to the Solingen production cooperative (see this volume, pp.
415-17).
This is what Klein told Engels about the incident with Schapper: during Schapper's and Engels' stay in Sollingen in 1849, Schapper said to Engels once: 'Brother Engels, why do you argue with these dogs wearing kid gloves, take out your sword and cut off their heads'.
Further on, Klein told the story of how Engels, as a young man, once paid his workers' wages 'on the basis of the communist principle'.

— 459 581 A programme of the Paris society of proletarians-positivists was read at the General Council meeting of 15 March 1870.
It stressed that the society members 'aim at social regeneration without God or King and hope to bring it about by the propagation of the positivist doctrine'.
When discussing their admittance to the International, Marx stated that 'their rules were too exclusive and contrary to the General Rules of the Association'.
Marx and Mottershead spoke out 'against admitting them as positivists'.
On Milner's suggestion, a decision was reached to instruct Dupont as Corresponding Secretary for France to try and make the proletarians-positivists aware of the discrepancies in their programme.
Comtism (positivism), a trend in bourgeois philosophy and sociology founded by Auguste Comte which opposes both speculative idealism and materialism; it recognises the practical results achieved by science but rejects its philosophical materialist conclusions from the position of agnosticism.
Com­ tism reduces all scientific cognition, including that in history and sociology (the latter term has been coined by Comte) to empirical knowledge.
Social development is considered from a biological angle.
According to Comte, capitalism is the highest stage of social development, and attempts at its revolutionary change are supposed to be futile.
Comte believed that the road Notes 649 to social harmony lies through 'new religion', a cult of an abstract higher being.

George Henry Moore demanded, on 17 March 1870, that the Government launch a 'full and free' public inquiry into the matter.
Under pressure from public opinion, Gladstone was forced, when replying to Moore, to agree to such an inquiry, but made a significant stipulation as to the character of the commission, stating that he 'shall be responsible for the manner in which the inquiry is conducted'.
Thus Gladstone secured the right to appoint not a Parliamentary but a Royal commission which would not be accountable to Parliament.
Moore's inquiry and Gladstone's reply were published in The Times on 18 March; on 19 March, in the column 'Treatment of Political Prisoners' and under the heading 'Probable Inquiry', The Irishman featured the item (mentioned by Engels) which, contrary to what Gladstone had stated, said that a Parliamentary commission was to be appointed.

In a Committee letter of 17 March 1870, Wilhelm Bracke noted that Johann Georg Eccarius had long been commissioned with obtaining 3,000 International membership cards which could have been distributed in the Party.
On receiving the letter, Marx immediately forwarded the requested membership cards to Leonhard von Bonhorst as the Committee Secretary.
—464 591 A reference to Bonhorst's letter to Marx of 21 February 1870 and Bonhorst's letter to Borkheim of 17 March 1870, which Borkheim forwarded to Marx on 21 March.

—464 593 The Coercion Bill was introduced in the House of Commons by Gladstone on 17 March 1870, and passed by it.
Aimed against the national liberation movement, the Bill provided for the suspension of constitutional guarantees in Ireland and the introduction of extraordinary powers for the English authorities in the struggle against the Irish revolutionaries.
Mentioning Clanricarde, Marx refers to his speech of 21 March 1870, during the discussion of the Bill in the House of Lords.
Clanricarde accused Gladstone's government of leniency towards Ireland and demanded a harsher policy to restore 'social order' there.

Its stated goal was promotion of culture and education, but it really campaigned for political unification of all Serb territories.
The democratic wing headed by S.
Markovic opposed the liberal trend prevailing in the Omladina, which tended to ignore the class aspect of this issue.

— 472 6°2 Between 22 February and 28 May 1870, the North German Reichstag held a debate on the criminal code.
On 1 March, the Reichstag voted for the abolition of capital punishment; on 15 March, the liberals suggested that for political prisoners, hard labour should be replaced by imprisonment, but whenever a political crime had been committed for dishonest reasons, penal servitude should be retained.
This motion, which gave the government an opportuni­ ty to put political prisoners in convict prisons, was passed by the Reichstag.
The debate on the criminal code ended on 25 May 1870, with capital punishment restored on the insistence of the government on 23 May.
—477 603 In a letter to Engels of 5 April 1870, Liebknecht wrote about his plan to go to Berlin and try and found a cheap daily newspaper there.
In the same letter, he spoke highly of Engels' preface to the second edition of The Peasant War in Germany (present edition, Vol.
21), and wrote that the views expounded by Engels coincided with his own.
He also intended to publish his report on the land question in Germany in connection with the decisions of the Basle Congress to abolish private property on land (see notes 447 and 458).
—477 604 A reference to Sigismund Borkheim's letter to Marx of 8 April 1870, in which he quoted Liebknecht who complained in a letter to Borkheim that Marx disliked him.
—478, 482 605 Pfänder was elected member of the General Council on 1 November 1864, and remained one until 1867.
On 18 January 1870, Pfänder was again elected to the General Council, but did not take an active part in its work until 12 April 1870.
—478 606 After L'Egalité editorial board had been reorganised (see notes 507 and 525), the Bakuninists, attempting to retain their lost positions, secured a formal majority of votes at a regular congress of the Romance Federation held in La Chaux-de-Fonds on 4-6 April 1870.
The congress discussed the attitude of the working class towards the political struggle.
In contrast to the Geneva sections, the Bakuninists advocated abstention from political struggle referring to the French text of the Rules (see Marx's work 'The General Council to the Federal Council of Romance Switzerland', present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
89-90).
On Bakunin's insistence, the congress began its proceedings with the admission of the newly-formed sections to the Federation.
A sharp controversy arose over the admission of the section named 'Alliance of Socialist Democracy—Central Section' founded by Bakunin in Geneva in June 1869 which, in fact, exercised leadership in the secret International Alliance of Socialist Democracy, and the Chaux-de-Fonds pro-Bakunin section.
Utin, one of the leaders of the Russian Section in Geneva, exposed Bakunin's schismatic activities.
A split occurred; the Geneva delegates and other General Council supporters continued their work independently.
An announcement about the Chaux-de-Fonds split mentioned by Marx was published in L'Egalité, No.
15, 9 April 1870.
The Bakuninists had assumed the name of the Romance Congress, elected a new Federal Committee and transferred its seat to La Chaux-de-Fonds.
Thus two Federal Committees appeared in Romance Switzerland, in Geneva and in La Chaux-de-Fonds.
The Bakuninists started publication of a newspaper La Solidarité, under the editorship of James Guillaume, first in Neuchâtel (11 April 1870-12 May 1871), and then in Geneva.
In fact it was the continuation of Le Progrès.
In early April 1870, representatives of the Romance Federal Committee and supporters of the Alliance sent the General Council detailed reports on the congress in La Chaux-de-Fonds and requested that it pass a decision concerning the split.
On 12 April, the Council instructed Jung to collect additional material, and, having received exhaustive information in April and May, on 28 June 1870 it passed a resolution proposed by Marx which confirmed the powers of the old Federal Committee.
The Bakuninist Federal Committee was instructed to assume another title (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
136).
—480, 493 607 A reference to the famine that struck Ireland in 1845-47.
It was caused by the potato crop failure and the large-scale exports of other foodstuffs from the country.
According to the data of 1851, between 1841 and 1851, the famine and eviction of small tenants from land ('the clearing of estates') resulted in the death of over a million people and emigration of another million.
— 480 608 Marx is referring to the section on Ireland in Chapter VI of the first German edition of Capital in 1867 (pp.

— 481 609 Freeholders—a group of small landowners in England.
They paid the landlord an insignificant fixed rent and had the right to dispose freely of their plots.
They enjoyed low property qualifications of 40 shillings (£2) (annual income).
In 1829, this figure was raised five times over, and 40-shilling freeholders lost the right to vote.
In the 1830s-40s, more and more freeholders were rapidly ruined, their lands passing into the hands of landlords who leased them to big farmers, capitalist tenants.

At one of the sessions, Schulze made an attempt to disprove Darwin's theory.
—482 611 Under the Poor Law that had existed in England since the 16th century, each parish levied a tax for the benefit of the poor; parishioners unable to provide for themselves and their families received aid through poor relief funds.
In 1834, a new Poor Law was passed in England that recognised only one form of help, placing the poor into workhouses under a prison-like regime which the people nicknamed 'poor men's Bastilles'.
— 484 653 612 Engels is referring to preparations for the so-called plebiscite which Napoleon III hoped to use to consolidate his somewhat shaky position.
On 20 April 1870, the government made public a new constitution which was a compromise between the authoritarian and the parliamentary systems.
It was followed by a decree on 23 April, which proposed that the French people use the plebiscite to approve or reject the following: 'The People approves the liberal reforms effected in the Constitution since 1860 by the Emperor, with the cooperation of the great bodies of the State, and ratifies the Senatus-Consultus of the 20th April 1870.
' The issue was worded in such a way that a positive answer to it would sound like an approval of the overall political structure of the Second Empire.
As a result of a plebiscite held on 8 May 1870, about 3.
5 million citizens in fact opposed the Empire (1,894,681 abstained, and 1,577,939 voted against).
A large share of the votes against the Empire belonged to the French army; in Paris alone, 46,000 servicemen gave a negative answer.
—484, 508, 513, 514 613 Engels uses the term 'gouvernement direct par le peuple' meaning the so-called direct popular legislation, référendums on the various issues of the internal affairs and policies of the Swiss cantons (see Note 276).
Thus, on 6 February 1870, the canton of Ticino held a referendum on the changes in the cantonal constitution (administrative division, representation in the cantonal council, etc).
On 20 February, the canton of Zurich held référendums on the tax bill, etc.

—485, 489 616 On Marx's suggestion, on 12 April 1870, the General Council granted the credentials of the International's correspondent in France to Henri Verlet.
—485 617 The first French edition of the International's Rules, 'Congrès ouvrier.
Association Internationale des Travailleurs.
Règlement Provisoire', was pub­ lished by the French Section of the International set up in Paris in 1864 by the workers Tolain, Fribourg and others, who had Proudhonist sympathies.
The translation, which appeared in early January 1865.
contained a number of distortions and errors.
(See present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
89-90.
) In November 1866, after the Geneva Congress, which approved the Provisional Rules, Marx and Lafargue published a verified translation of the Rules of the International Working Men's Association and the Administrative Regulations, but that edition was not widely distributed in France, since it was almost entirely confiscated by the French police.
On 18 April, replying to a proposal by Marx, Lafargue wrote that it was impossible to publish the Rules in La Libre pensée, since the newspaper was registered as a purely literary publication (see this volume, p.
557).
However, Lafargue managed to get the verified translation of the Rules published, and it appeared in Paris after 20 April 1870.
The translation had been checked by Lafargue.
Against a background of mounting police reprisals in France, it became necessary to expedite the publication of the Rules and Lafargue had no chance to send the manuscript to Marx for review.
In June 1870, Lafargue's translation was published for the second time in: Procès de l'Association Internationale des travailleurs.
Première et deuxième commission du Bureau de Paris, Deuxième édition, Paris, juin 1870.
— 486, 557 618 Marx is referring to H.
Verlet's article 'Force et matière' published in La Libre pensée, No.
13, 16 April 1870.
The author spoke highly of Büchner's book Kraft und Stoff.
— 486 619 Marx sent Engels Ferret's letter to Jung of 15 April 1870, in which Perret described in detail the split that occurred at the Chaux-de-Fonds Congress (see Note 606) and the Bakuninists' intrigues in the Swiss sections of the International.
— 488 620 On 7 April 1870, the Federal Committee newly established by the Bakuninists (at the Chaux-de-Fonds Congress; see Note 606), which had its headquarters at Chaux-de-Fonds, directed a letter to the General Council requesting it to settle the conflict between itself and the Romance Federal Council.
The letter, which was signed by the Federal Committee Secretary F.
Robert, also informed the General Council about the establishment of a new La Solidarité newspaper by the Bakuninists.
—488 621 Laura and Paul Lafargue's letters of 18 April (see this volume, pp.
556-57) and after 20 April 1870, informed Marx about the foundation, in Paris, of the Federal Council of the International Working Men's Association (see Note 644).
Lafargue believed that for expediency's sake, he should not become a member of the newly established Council but should be a representative of the London General Council at the Paris Federation.
He asked Marx to discuss granting him these powers at the next meeting.
This was done by the General Council on 17 May 1870.
—489 622 Replying to Marx's letter before 4 May 1870, Laura Lafargue stated that Marx's warning about Paul Robin's splitting activities had been communicated to Leo Frankel.
—489 623 A reference to the resolutions proposed by Bakunin at the congress of the League of Peace and Freedom held in Berne in 1868 in connection with the discussion of the League's draft programme.
Bakunin spoke several times in defence of his proposals.
His speeches, as well as his and his followers' announcement about their withdrawal from the League, were published in Herzen's Kolokol, No.
14-15, 1 December 1868.
—489 624 The demand to abolish the right of inheritance was put forward by Saint-Simon's followers (Enfantin, Bazard, Rodrigues, Bûchez, etc.
) who, in the late 1820s, set out to popularise and develop Saint-Simon's doctrine.
In 1830, a book was published in Paris which, based as it was on Bazard's lectures, expressed the views of Saint-Simon's followers on the right of inheritance: Doctrine de Saint-Simon Exposition.

—490 625 A reference to the General Council entering the question of the right of inheritance on the Basle Congress agenda (see Note 379).
A major preliminary discussion on the issue was held at the General Council in the summer of 1869.
On 3 August the Council approved Marx's 'Report of the General Council on the Right of Inheritance' (see present edition, Vol.
21).
Marx's report was read at the Congress by Eccarius on 11 September 1869.
— 492 626 A reference to Kolokol, the Russian revolutionary democratic newspaper edited by Alexander Herzen and Nikolai Ogarev.
It was published in Russian in Notes 655 1857-67, and in French with Russian supplements in 1868-70, in London up to 1865 and later in Geneva.
After Herzen's death in 1870, an attempt to keep up the newspaper was made by Sergei Nechayev, who was in close contact with Bakunin.
This is probably what Marx means.
Six issues appeared in April-Mav 1870.
—492, 508, 516 627 Marx refers to Laura Lafargue's letter of 18 April 1870.
Calling her Laurent, Marx hints at Paul-Laurent, the pen-name of Paul Lafargue (see Note 615; see also this volume, p.
557).
— 493, 555 628 Engels is referring to a speech at the Chaux-de-Fonds Congress (see Note 606) by François Dupleix, who accused Bakunin's followers of atheism and alleged that the workers were unwilling to have the question of their faith discussed.
— 495 629 On 16 and 20 April 1870, Liebknecht published in Der Volksstaat, nos.
31 and 32, Bakunin's article 'Briefe über die revolutionäre Bewegung in Russland.

'—496, 499, 519 630 Marx is referring to the lectures on ethnology read by Flourens at the Collège de France in the early 1860s and published in 1863 as a book: G.
Flourens, Histoire de l'homme.
Cours d'histoire naturelle des corps organisés au Collège de France, Paris, 1863.
—497 631 On 12 April 1870, the General Council instructed Marx and Dupont to draw up a protest, on behalf of the International, concerning the harsh verdict brought in against the participants in the March strike at Eugène Schneider's metal works in Creuzot.
However, the large-scale police reprisals against members of the International which began in France in late April forced the General Council to revise its plans and replace the protest with a leaflet, written by Marx, 'Concerning the Persecution of the Members of the French Sections.
Declaration of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association' (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
127).
— 497 632 On 3 May 1870, Bracke and Bonhorst requested Engels' permission to publish his letter to Bracke of 28 April in Der Volksstaat, organ of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party, saying that it was of general interest and importance to Party members.
Engels was to write to them before 10 May if he did not agree.
On 14 May, an excerpt from Engels' letter was published in Der Volksstaat.
The editors of the present edition do not possess the original letter.
— 498 633 On 17 March 1870, Leonhard von Bonhorst, Secretary of the Committee of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party of Germany, sent Engels a cashier's report for 1869, in which he wrote about the poor state of the Party's finances.
— 498 634 On 17 March 1870, Bonhorst as Secretary of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party Committee wrote to Marx and Engels that the workers forming the basis of the party were too passive.
He also stated, 'since our party is, amongst other things, the youngest of those that have entered the social and political arena, it is probably also lacking in strength.
'—499 635 Engels' letter to Borkheim, written later than 28 April 1870, has not been found.
—499, 507 636 The Commission for the Publication of the Ancient Laws and Institutes of Ireland was set up by the British Government in 1852 (see Note 481).
—501, 519, 520 637 A reference to the first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party by Marx and Engels, which appeared in Geneva in 1869 in Bakunin's 656 Notes translation.
The book was printed at the Kolokol printshop.
The inadequacies of Bakunin's translation, which in places somewhat distorted the meaning of this major programme document of the proletarian party, were corrected in Plekhanov's translation, which was published in Geneva in 1882.
— 502 638 A reference to Wilhelm Liebknecht's letter to Engels of 27 April 1870.
— 503 639 Marx and his daughter Eleanor went on a visit to Engels in Manchester on 23 May and stayed there until about 23 June 1870.
—504, 520, 529 640 On 3 May 1870, the French Section in London (see Note 72) gave a banquet for Flourens, who had fled from France under threat of arrest.
An account of the banquet was forwarded to France, Germany and some other countries by Reuter and Havas-Bullier agencies and published, specifically, in the Journal des Débats on 5 May.
It stated that the banquet was chaired by 'M.
Le Lubez, président de la Société Internationale', when Le Lubez had in fact been expelled from the International for slander back in 1866.
On 10 May 1870, the General Council approved Marx's 'Draft Resolution of the General Council on the "French Federal Section in London"', in which it resolutely dissociated itself from the provocative activities of the French Section (see present edition, Vol.
21).
—504 641 Société du dix Décembre (Society of December 10), a Bonapartist organisation established in 1849 and consisting, for the most part, of déclassé elements.
A detailed account of the Society can be found in Marx's work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (see present edition, Vol.
11, pp.
149-51, 186, 193-96).
—504, 523 642 In view of the preparations for the plebiscite to be held in France (see Note 612), commencing in late April 1870, arrests of socialists began through­ out the country.
They were charged with belonging to the International Working Men's Association, as well as with 'complicity' in the plot against Napoleon III (the so-called Blois trial), which was in fact staged by the Prefect of the Paris Police Pietri.
On 5 May 1870, the Journal officiel made public the verdict of guilty passed by the Procurator General Grandperret, who charged a number of persons, including Flourens, with complicity in the fictitious plot.
On the same day, La Gaulois alleged that Flourens, who was at that time in England, had been persecuted by the British police and thus forced to go into hiding.
—505, 522, 558 fi43 After an attempt on the life of Napoleon III made by the Italian revolutionary Orsini, in February 1858, Palmerston introduced in the House of Commons the Conspiracy to Murder Bill, under which émigrés and natives were to be severely punished for participation in political plots.
The Bill was introduced under the pretext of threats by the French Government, which accused England of granting asylum to political refugees.
Under pressure from a mass protest movement, the Bill was voted down by the House of Commons and Palmerston was obliged to resign.
— 505 644 yhe Paris Federation of the International Working Men's Association was founded on 18 April 1870, at a general meeting of the International's sections in Paris under the chairmanship of Louis Eugène Varlin.
The meeting, which attracted 1,200-1,300 participants, adopted the Rules of the Federation (see this volume, pp.
555-56).
However, the police reprisals and arrests of the International's members which began in France late in April 1870 in connection with preparations for the plebiscite (see Note 612) disrupted the activities of the Federation.

—506 647 On 2 April 1870, Der Volksstaat, edited by Liebknecht, began the publication of Engels' work The Peasant War in Germany.
A serious blunder was made by the editorial board when printing Chapter II: on 4 May, the newspaper featured the end of this chapter, while the preceding page had been left out and appeared only on 7 May with the editorial board's note: 'The excerpt contained in today's issue was to have appeared before the part published in the last issue.
This vexing error was caused by the absence of our type-setter who is responsible for imposing the issue (this type-setter is away on an agitation tour).
' Engels is referring to Liebknecht's footnote on Hegel that appeared in Der Volksstaat on 30 April 1870.
—509, 513 648 Marx gives Engels an account of Liebknecht's letter of 7 May 1870, in which Liebknecht invited Engels, through Marx, to the Stuttgart Congress of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party scheduled for 4-7 June 1870.

658 Notes Liebknecht promised to put in a statement to the effect that the notes had been supplied by the editorial board and not Engels.
He considered it unnecessary to publish Engels' official statement (see this volume, pp.

— 519 656 On 16 March 1870, Der Volksstaat, No.
22, carried Borkheim's article 'Ein Brief Netschajeffs' (in German, with a Russian translation made by Borkheim himself).
The article was signed 'Der Autor der Russischen Briefe in der Berliner Zukunft'.
Russischen Briefe was the name of Borkheim's articles about Russia featured by Die Zukunft in 1869-70 (see Note 274).
On 14 May the editorial board of Der Volksstaat published the opening passages of Nechayev's reply, which is what Marx is writing about to Engels.
— 519, 521 657 Engels visited Marx in London on his way to Germany late in December 1869.
—521 658 Marx sent Engels an anonymous article 'Das Treiben der deutschen Kommunis­ ten' from the American newspaper Der Pionier of 27 April 1870.
The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, which was published in New York by German petty-bourgeois democratic émigrés, was Karl Heinzen.
The author of the article, who was obviously concerned about the successes of the newly-founded Social-Democratic Workers' Party of Germany and its newspaper Der Volksstaat, made libellous statements about Marx, Engels, Liebknecht and Eccarius, contrasting communists and the 'German revolutionary democracy'.
Specifically, with reference to Lassalle, the article stated that in 1849 he had made all the necessary preparations for an uprising in Cologne but that Marx, who had promised to do the same in Düsseldorf and certain other localities, had failed to do so thus letting Lassalle down.
In this letter, Marx refers to Heinzen as Heineke, a character in the German song of the same name, which is a folk parody of the so-called grobian literature of the 16th century.
Marx thus nicknamed Heinzen for the first time in 1847 in his work Moralising Criticism and Critical Morality, in which he likened Heinzen's journalism to specimens of this brand of literature (see present edition, Vol.
6, pp.
312-40).

-528 665 In early July 1870, Lafargue wrote in a letter to Marx that he would be visited by a young Russian revolutionary, one Hermann Lopatin, to whom he had given Marx's address and a letter of introduction.
Marx and Lopatin met on 2 July 1870.
Describing his meeting with Marx, Lopatin wrote: '.
.
.
I was afraid to run out of subjects for discussion with this luminary, and then I was secretly puzzled—what language except that of signs could I use to communicate with him? All my fears proved groundless on both of my visits (of which the last lasted for ten hours), the conversation did not stop for a minute.
' Lopatin visited Marx for a second time on 3 July same year.
— 530 666 This excerpt from Marx's letter was quoted by Lopatin in a letter to Lavrov of 6 July 1870.
First, Lopatin gave a short exposition of Marx's letter: 'Today, I received from him (Marx) a new issue of the Narodnoye Dyelo (People's Cause) and a very nice note with the latest news about the court trial of our Paris comrades (the reference is to the third trial of the International's members in France; see Note 667— Ed.

He concluded by asking if I should like him to find me a clerk's job at some London office.
'—535 667 A reference is to the third trial of the members of the Paris Federation of the International arrested by the French police on the eve of the plebiscite (see notes 612 and 642).
The trial was held between 22 June and 5 July 1870.
The prosecution failed to bring in the charge of conspiracy; the defendants were charged not with complicity in the fictitious plot, but with being members of the International.
—537 668 Marx enclosed with this letter the text of the 'Confidential Communication to All Sections' and the 'Programme for the Mainz Congress of the International', which was to open in Mainz on 5 September 1870.
Both documents were written in French.

After government troops had been sent to Creuzot, the strike took on a political character.
The Bonapartist government managed to suppress it by making mass arrests.

—556 688 A reference to the address of the so-called London French Section on the question of the plebiscite, 'Adresse aux citoyens français', which appeared in La Marseillaise, No.
116, 15 April 1870.
In connection with this and other documents of this organisation, which illegally used the name of the International, on 10 May the General Council approved Marx's statement which stressed that the Section had 'ceased .
.
.
to have any connection whatever with the General Council in London or any Branch of that Association on the continent' (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
131).
— 556 689 Lafargue is replying to Marx's advice to avoid any distinctive names except territorial designations when setting up new sections of the International (see this volume, p.
485).
Later, the London Conference of the International held on 17-23 September 1871, granted this recommendation, which was spear­ headed against sectarianism, the status of a clause in the Rules (see present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
423-24).

Irländische Volksmelodien nach Thomas Moore, with the lyrics, Irish Melodies, written by Thomas Moore.
The collection was prepared and published in Hanover in 1870 by the singer Joseph Risse, whom Marx and Jenny met in 1867 during a visit to the Kugelmanns.
Engels' note mentioned in this letter probably was not used in the preface.
— 563 693 The letter was written two days before the Franco-Prussian war, which began on 19 July 1870.
Jenny, who was misled by the Bonapartist press, was unable to give a sound assessment of the French public's mood on the eve of the war.
The chauvinistic demonstrations were organised in Paris and the provinces by the government, which made use of police agents and declasse elements.
Paul Lafargue wrote to Marx in July 1870 that in Paris, 'the police were obliged to feign enthusiasm so as to make it credible'.
