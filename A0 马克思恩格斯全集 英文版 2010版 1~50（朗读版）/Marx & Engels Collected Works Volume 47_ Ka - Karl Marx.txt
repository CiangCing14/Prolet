M.
COOK: Letter 135 STEPHEN SMITH: Letters 10, 76 Preface Volume 47 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels contains Engels' letters dated from April 1883 to December 1886.
The letters at the beginning of this volume to the participants of democratic and labour movements in Russia, Germany, Holland, Britain, the United States and Italy on Marx's death reflect the world-wide concern over this sad development.
After Marx's death, the volume of Engels' correspondence increased considerably.
The stream of letters from all over the world was evidence of growth of the workers' and democratic move­ ment in Europe and the United States, of Engels' influence on this process and his expanding ties with leaders of socialist parties.
New names appeared among his correspondents, such as those of Hermann Schlüter, John Lincoln Mahon, Pasquale Martignetti, and Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky.
He wrote not only to friends, com­ rades and followers, but also to strangers who turned to him for ad­ vice or with requests (see this volume, pp.
8, 27, 66, 282-83).
For Engels maintaining and expanding his international contacts was a most demanding duty.
He wrote to August Bebel on 30 April 1883: 'For after all, we wish to maintain intact, in so far as it is in my po­ wer, the many threads from all over the world which spontaneously converged upon Marx's study' (p.
17).
Marx named Engels and Eleanor Marx his 'literary executors'.
En-gels concentrated on completing the publication of Marx's unfinished works, first of all volumes II and III of Capital, which he had left in handwritten variants, and of new editions of Volume I of Capital (p.
39).
Engels also intended to undertake, but unfortunately did not write, a full biography of Marx on the basis of the existing extensive correspondence and other material from Marx's archive, which would incorporate the history of the German socialist movement from 1843 to 1863 and of the International from 1864 to 1872 (pp.
17, 26).
In his letters, Engels referred repeatedly to the history of the Inter­ national Working Men's Association, stressing the role Marx had played in it.
'Mohr's life without the International,' he wrote (in English) to Laura Lafargue on 24 June 1883, 'would be a diamond ring with the diamond broken out' (p.
40).
Engels completed the preparation for the printer, begun by Marx, of the third German edition of Volume I of Capital before the end of 1883.
This involved much painstaking labour (as his letter to Fried-rich Adolph Sorge of 29 June 1883, among others, shows).
He also went out of his way to assure the appearance of Capital in other lan­ guages (p.
87), choosing translators with great care, and often helping to edit their translations.
With Samuel Moore, Edward Aveling and Eleanor Marx, he organised and edited the first English translation of Volume I of Capital (pp.
436-37) which took him 'the better part of a year' (p.
492).
Many of Engels' letters refer to his preparation for the printer of the second and third volumes of Marx's Capital.
They are imbued with respect for his deceased friend and with the wish to make the works of Marx available to the working class and progressive intellec­ tuals.
'.
.
.
Some labour when you're dealing with a man like Marx, who weighed every word,' Engels wrote to Johann Philipp Becker on 22 May 1883.
'But to me it is a labour of love; after all I shall be back again with my old comrade' (p.
26).
Other letters on this score give a fairly good idea of how Engels la­ boured over Capital's economic manuscripts — how he virtually de­ ciphered Marx's handwriting, how he determined the chronological framework, collated notes, compared separate variants, checked quo­ tations, and finally transcribed the entire volume in order to edit the clean copy (pp.
29, 33, 42-43, 53, 88-89).
He could not let anyone else do this because, as he put it, 'there is not another living soul who can decipher that writing and those abbreviations of words and style' (p.
93).
Preparation of Volume III dragged out and the volume did not appear in print until 1894.
In his letters to Karl Kautsky of 21-22 June 1884 and Johann Philipp Becker of 2 April 1885, and elsewhere, Engels emphasised the scientific significance of the second and third volumes of Capital (pp.
154, 267).
Engels followed carefully the dissemination of Marx's ideas.
Of particular interest are his letters about the popular summary of Capi­ tal produced by the French socialist Gabriel Deville.
Engels was con­ cerned that the explication of Marxism's basic economic principles should be comprehensible to working people and not overly abstruse (p.
61), and in his letters to Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky he re­ commended publishing the popularisations by Deville and Paul La-fargue.
This would, he argued, introduce Capital and its ideas into the United States (pp.
464-65).
Engels also welcomed Kautsky's book, Karl Marx's Oekonomische Lehren, which was well received by the public (p.
482).
In the 1880s, economic literature, notably by the so-called 'arm­ chair socialists' (Kathedersozialisten), charged that Marx had bor­ rowed his theory of surplus value from Rodbertus (pp.
138-39).
This charge of plagiarism had to be refuted once and for all owing to the influence the armchair socialists were gaining among some Social Democrats.
Engels produced a critical analysis of the main works of Rodbertus, whom he vividly described as 'apostle of the careerists of Bismarckian socialism' (p.
139) in letters to Eduard Bernstein and Karl Kautsky (pp.
72, 125-26, 193-94), whose content accords with ideas Engels originally expressed in his prefaces to the first Ger­ man edition of Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy ('Marx and Rodber­ tus') and the first edition of Volume II of Capital (see present edition, Vols.
26 and 36).
The correspondence refers extensively to Engels' work on the trans­ lation and republication of a number of other important works by Marx and himself.
The letters show that, in choosing these works, En-gels was above all guided by the needs of the workers' movement, with an eye to the continuous entry into it of new people unversed in theory.
In some countries, the workers' movement of the 1880s was quite strongly influenced by the anarchists.
The focal point of their polem­ ics with Social Democrats was the question of the State.
On 18 April 1883, answering the American Philipp Van Patten's question on Marx's attitude to anarchists, Engels elaborated on the historical fu­ ture of the State.
He described anarchist formulae — that the prole­ tarian revolution should begin by abolishing the State — as 'anarchist ab­ surdities', because this would be tantamount to destroying 'the only orga­ nism by means of which the victorious working class can exert its newly conquered power' (p.
10).
Engels dwelt on the matter also in a letter to Bernstein, this time in connection with the latter's attack in the press on some American socialists who had also failed to under­ stand Marx's doctrine of the State.
Engels referred Bernstein to Marx's The Civil War in France and cited extracts from The Poverty of Philosophy and the Manifesto of the Communist Party (pp.
73-74, 86).
To bring the Marxist doctrine of the State to those who had newly joined the socialist movement, Engels republished these and other works (Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and Engels' Anti-Diihring and The Housing Question).
Engels examined the nature and class essence of the State in his The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (see present edition, Vol.
26).
He noted that he wrote the book to fulfil Marx's wishes.
Marx had read Ancient Society by the liberal American scholar, Lewis H.
Morgan, and had himself planned to write on the subject (pp.
103, 115-16).
The correspondence of the 1880s lifts the veil on Engels' further elaboration of the theory of socialist revolution.
He was above all pre­ occupied by the question of tactics and, in particular, by what he saw as the incorrect evaluation by the German Social Democrats of the character of the expected revolution.
Engels examined capitalist world development in the 1880s, and concluded that the socialist rev­ olution in countries with semi-absolutist political survivals and feu­ dal relations in agriculture (for instance, Germany) would necessarily be preceded by a bourgeois-democratic stage.
'.
.
.
In our case .
.
.
,' he wrote to Bernstein in 1883, 'the first, immediate result of the revolu­ tion can and must, so far as form is concerned, be nothing other than a bourgeois republic'(p.
51).
Then and only then would the struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie follow classical lines, i.
e.
pave the way to 'direct, undisguised class struggle between prole­ tariat and bourgeoisie' (ibid.
).
At the same time, Engels warned against imagining 'the revolution as something that can be achieved overnight.
In fact it is a process of development on the part of the masses which takes several years even under conditions that tend to accelerate it' (p.
51).
All his life Engels examined the dynamics of capitalist economics.
Like Marx, he noticed the modification of the economic cycle and the appearance of intermediate five-year crises.
He associated this with the uneven development of the leading states and the gradual decline of Great Britain in the world market (pp.
23, 82).
To be sure, not all of Engels' predictions came true.
Among others, this applies to the idea of an economic 'crisis without end' (p.
402) which he predicted in a letter to Nikolai Danielson of 8 February 1886 and Florence Kel-ley-Wischnewetzky of 3 February 1886 (pp.
396-97).
In the 1890s, Engels would elaborate on his views, noting capitalism's considerable stability and expanding sphere of influence (see present edition, Vol.
37).
In many of his letters, Engels touched on various international problems of the mid-1880s which arose owing to the rivalry of the Eu­ ropean powers in the Balkans, Germany's aggressive policies, and the views of certain circles in France who wanted back the lands Prussia had seized in 1871 (pp.
353, 483-84, 485-86, 510-11, 513-14).
Exa­ mining the diplomatic games in Europe, the balance of power and the probable consequences of a military conflict, Engels helped Euro­ pean socialists to work out their tactics in questions of war and peace.
In his letters to August Bebel, Johann Philipp Becker and Friedrich Adolph Sorge he stressed that workers of all countries should fight against the militarist system and the war danger.
Though Engels ad­ mitted that war might create favourable conditions for the victory of the working class, he did not relate revolution and its victory directly to war.
On the contrary, he was convinced war would take an incre­ dibly high toll and 'retard our movement' (pp.
353-54, 487).
Special mention should be made of letters to members of the So­ cialist Workers' Party of Germany which, as Engels put it, was at that time the leading European workers' party (p.
36).
The German labour movement in 1883-86 was exposed to the ri­ gours of Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Law.
By combining legal and ille­ gal methods, the party managed to win influence among the mass of the people by the mid-1880s.
Engels described its success in Reichstag elections as a trial of strength (p.
198).
He believed that socialist parties should participate in election campaigns and parliamentary activity, but did not regard them as the only or main form of struggle.
Looking into the experience of the German Social Democrats, he called their attention to the conditions on which they might come forward with their own bills without preju­ dicing their principles.
In a letter to Bernstein of 11 November 1884, he said such bills could be formulated 'without regard for petty-bourgeois prejudices' and could avoid being Utopian (p.
217).
He elaborated on this in a letter to Bebel of 20-23 January 1886 (pp.
388-89).
Engels helped the left wing of the German Social Democratic movement in its fight against reformist elements who had a majority in the Social Democratic parliamentary group.
He traced the spread of reformism to the influence of the petty bourgeoisie.
'In a philistine country like Germany,' he observed in a letter to Johann Philipp Becker of 15 June 1885 'the party must also have a philistine "edu­ cated" right wing' (p.
300).
That most of the parliamentary group were men of petty-bourgeois background was traceable to the ab­ sence of deputies' salaries, which barred the doors to the Reichstag for many promising worker deputies.
Reacting to differences within the Social Democratic parliamen­ tary group over the bill on State subsidies to shipping companies, En-gels set forth his views on party unity in letters to Bebel and others (pp.
239, 269-71, 284 et al).
Letting matters reach an open break with the right wing, he felt, was undesirable in the context of the Anti-Socialist Law, and would only weaken the party: in the ab­ sence of a forum for public discussion, the rank-and-file would hardly be able to understand the reasons for, and substance of, the split.
En-gels wrote to Bernstein on 5 June 1884: 'We .
.
.
must steer clear of any­ thing that might lead to a breach, or rather might lay the blame for that breach at our door.
That is the universal rule when there is a struggle within one's own party, and now it applies more than ever' (p.
145).
We see from his correspondence that Engels was a faithful reader of Der Sozialdemokrat, the central organ of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, and, indeed, was always ready to help its staffheaded by Bernstein.
His letters were often made the core of editorials, and thus came to be known to the German workers (pp.
139-42, 329-31).
Engels' letters to August Bebel, leader of the party's left wing, touched on an especially broad spectrum of problems.
Engels wrote of Bebel: 'There is no more lucid mind in the whole of the German party, besides which he is utterly dependable and firm of purpose' (pp.
201-02).
Engels' letter to Wilhelm Liebknecht of 2 January 1886, first found in 1983, is being published in English translation here for the first time, filling a gap in their correspondence which has reached us incomplete.
During that period, Engels devoted much of his attention to the in­ dependent movement of the English working class, especially in con­ nection with 'the sudden emergence' of socialism in Britain (p.
82).
He saw the 'secret' of its revival (some decades after Owenism and Chartism had faded away) in the erosion of Britain's monopoly in the world market by American and German competition, and the impact of the economic depression which had dragged on and on since 1873 (ibid.
).
More than ten years of slump had increased unemployment, ruined tenant farmers, and speeded up rural migration to the cities, adding to the number of homeless and jobless.
The radical-minded intellectuals and politically active workers, disappointed in the Lib­ erals, turned to socialism for relief from economic strains and social contradictions.
The word 'socialism' was on everybody's lips.
In a let­ ter to Laura Lafargue, who was in Paris, Engels referred to 'the new Socialist "rage" in London' (pp.
94-95).
Engels, as his letters show, was critical of the Democratic Federa­ tion formed and headed by Henry Mayers Hyndman in 1881 and re­ named the Social Democratic Federation in 1884.
His guarded atti­ tude was due to its heterogeneous membership, the young people who had 'emerged from amongst the bourgeoisie'.
These elements, he wrote, varied considerably 'morally and intellectually', and had no root in the working class (pp.
54, 82).
'The elements presently active,' he wrote to Bebel on 30 August 1883, 'might become important, now that they have accepted our theoretical programme and thus ac­ quired a basis, but only if a spontaneous movement broke out amongst the workers here and they succeeded in gaining control of it' (p.
54).
After reading the Federation's manifesto, Engels commented that 'these people have now at last been compelled publicly to proclaim our theory as their own, a theory which, at the time of the Interna­ tional, seemed to them to have been imposed upon them from out­ side' (ibid.
).
But the incorporation in the programme of a Marxist provision—the socialisation of the means of production — did not mean a mass working-class political party had emerged.
Engels, how­ ever, had urged English workers to set up such a party as early as 1881, in his contribution to The Labour Standard (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
404-06).
The trade union movement was far removed from socialist ideas.
Yet the Social Democratic Federation's lead­ ership, notably Hyndman, renounced contacts with the organised workers.
Engels wrote to Laura Lafargue in February 1884: '.
.
.
The new "respectable" Socialist stir here does go on very nicely, the thing is becoming fashionable, but the working classes do not respond yet.
Upon that everything depends' (p.
105).
Engels criticised Hyndman for his lack of scruples, his disregard of political principles, and chauvinism in regard to other nations.
He called him to account, too, for his excessive ambition, and his ten­ dency towards political intrigue (pp.
118, 123, 155, 165, 236-37, 247, 366-67).
The fact that Marx had broken off relations with Hyndman in 1881 had, of course, contributed to Engels' guarded attitude (see present edition, Vol.
46, pp.
102-04).
Working jointly with Samuel Moore, Edward Aveling and Eleanor Marx on the English translation of Volume I of Capital, Engels was sceptical of Hyndman's translation of some of its chapters (pp.
127, 313, 424) printed in To-Day.
He criticised Hyndman's translation in an article, 'How Not to Translate Marx' (present edition, Vol.
26).
Nevertheless the appearance in the socialist press of large fragments of Capital before its publication under separate cover in 1887 after Engels' editing had helped the spread of Marx's economic theory among workers and intellectuals.
Engels' letters betray his good knowledge of such socialist periodi­ cals as Justice and To-Day from which he obtained an idea of the peo­ ple who had attached themselves to the socialist movement in the early half of the 1880s (pp.
85-86, 114, 122, 424).
He was also briefed on the activity of the Social Democratic Federation by Eleanor Marx, Ed­ ward Aveling, William Morris, Belfort Bax, and other of its left-leaning members.
Towards the close of 1884, Hyndman's sectarian tactics caused profound differences within the Federation, and led to the resignation of those on its left wing who formed a new organisa­ tion, the Socialist League.
Engels set forth the history ofthat split in letters to Bernstein and Sorge (pp.
236-38, 245).
In the years that fol­ lowed, he informed his correspondents in Germany and in the United States of the activity of those two socialist organisations.
Although critical of the SDF leadership, Engels approved of its ac­ tions in defence of the unemployed (holding demonstrations, sending deputations to MPs, and so forth).
However, he described its leaders' attempt at attracting the mass of workers with ultra-left slogans of 'social revolution' as reckless 'revolutionary ranting' (pp.
407-08, 427).
In the autumn of 1886 he admitted, however, that the 'Social Democratic Federation is beginning to be something of a power, since the masses have absolutely no other organisation to which they can rally' (p.
529).
However, among the active socialists of the SDF, the Radical Clubs in the East End, and the Socialist League, he saw no one who could lead a mass movement of the unemployed (pp.
526, 534).
Engels had close contacts with members of the Socialist League and supported their newspaper, The Commonweal, and was doubly upset by the symptoms in its ranks of'teething troubles', sectarianism, and anarchist influence (pp.
438, 446, 471).
Despite some successful actions, the socialist movement in Britain of the early half of the 1880s was divided and had no public backing to speak of.
'.
.
.
The masses,' Engels wrote to Sorge, 'are still holding aloof, although here too beginnings of a movement are perceptible.
But it will be some time before the masses are in full spate, which is a good thing because it means that there will be time for proper leaders to emerge' (p.
492).
In a series of letters Engels referred to specific features in the history of France and its labour movement.
Ever since 1789, he pointed out, the political struggles in France had followed classical lines, with the governments that succeeded each other 'moving ever further to the Left' (pp.
149, 342).
In 1885 Engels welcomed the collapse of Jules Ferry's cabinet which had ruled on behalf of the big bourgeoisie and stock exchange speculators with a big stake in colonial conquest, and had predicted the imminent victory in elections of the Radicals.
This, he hoped, would provide favourable conditions for class struggle (pp.
270, 364).
What might hamper the growth of the French labour move­ ment, he maintained, was its low theoretical level and the surviv­ ing influence of various types of pre-Marxian socialism (pp.
183, 342).
In his view, it had not yet fully recovered from the defeat of the Paris Commune (p.
211).
The correspondence is an important source of information about the processes that were underway in the French socialist movement of the early half of the 1880s.
In 1882 the movement broke up into se­ parate organisations of reformists (Possibilists) and collectivists, the latter comprising the Workers' Party, by and large an adherent of sci­ entific socialism.
Engels' letters clarify his outlook and that of the lead­ ers of the Workers' Party on two crucial issues that had a bearing on the party's future: the relationship with the Possibilists, and use of the bourgeois parliament in the workers' interests.
At a complicated time, with the Workers' Party locked in struggle with the Possibilists, Engels urged its leaders to study theory.
Some of his letters to Lafargue were printed as articles in the French socialist press (pp.
235-36, 255-56).
He commended Lafargue and Deville for lecturing on Marx's teaching in France and for coming to grips with the opponents of Marxism in the press (pp.
107, 134-35, 171, 179-83).
Engels welcomed the independent labour faction in the Chamber of Deputies.
For the first time, the voice of labour resounded publicly in defence of the striking miners of Decazeville.
The workers' deputies edged away from the Radicals, which Engels considered as 'a great event' (pp.
409, 414, 418, 441-42).
Although the faction was small, the Workers' Party had now acquired a public political, tribune.
Time and again, in letters to Bebel, Liebknecht, and Paul and Laura Lafargue, Engels offered his view of bourgeois radicalism in France whose influence had risen in the autumn of 1885.
Some of his statements were over-emphatic.
This applied first of all to his ideas about the historical possibilities of the Radicals, and also to over-optimistic predictions of the imminent emergence of the French socialists onto the political foreground (pp.
300, 314, 343, 470).
A conspicuous place in the volume is taken up by Engels' corre­ spondence with his old friend, the American socialist Friedrich Adolph Sorge, and with Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky, who trans­ lated some of Engels' works.
His letters show how profoundly he understood the specificity of the United States, a country that had had no feudal past and was the 'ideal of all bourgeois: a country rich, vast, expanding, with purely bourgeois institutions unleavened by feudal remnants or monarchical traditions, and without a perma­ nent and hereditary proletariat' (p.
452).
Still, the emergence of large-scale industry there resulted in the appearance of an indigenous working class.
A powerful workers' action for an eight-hour working day was mounted in 1886, with 11,500 enterprises being engulfed in strikes.
This and the success of the French socialists Engels described as 'the two events of world historic importance' of the year (p.
470).
The strikes demolished the image of a non-antagonistic America to which the European bourgeoisie had resorted in the election campaign.
'What has completely stunned these people is the fact that the movement is so strongly accentuated as a labour movement, and that it has sprung up so suddenly and with such force' (p.
533).
The socialist movement in 19th-century America was strongly in­ fluenced by German immigrants.
Nor was this influence all positive.
The Lassalleans, advocates of essentially political struggle, had all too often caused a weakening of local unions which confined them­ selves to economic demands only.
The Socialist Labor Party founded in 1876 consisted almost exclusively of German immigrants.
It had its newspapers, New-Yorker Volkszeitung and Der Sozialist, both of which appeared in German.
At times, the German socialist move-ment in the United States was perceived by its members as a branch of the German socialist movement in Europe.
Engels referred scath­ ingly to the bookwormish dogmatism of the German socialists in the USA (p.
531).
In a letter to Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky in De­ cember 1886, he deplored their sectarianism and non-participation in the 1886 movement of the American workers (pp.
541-42).
He was troubled by the lack of cohesion and unity in the US labour move­ ment, and referred to the subject at length in his letters, emphasising its importance (pp.
470, 525).
The letters show that Engels saw the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor, an organisation of chiefly unskilled white and black workers, as the point of departure in the drive for a true working-class party in the USA.
Not that he was blind to the mistakes of its leaders.
He con­ sidered it a real force, stating in no uncertain terms that the Order should be revolutionised from within, that it was necessary 'to work in their midst, to form .
.
.
a nucleus of men who know the movement and its aims' (pp.
532, 541).
Neither the Knights of Labor nor the United Labor Party, whose founding Engels welcomed in his letter to Laura Lafargue of 24 November 1886, however, proved viable.
When Kelley-Wischnewetzky asked for Engels' permission to translate and publish his book, The Condition of the Working-Class in England, he gave his consent and promised to edit the translation.
In lieu of a preface, he wrote an article, 'The Labour Movement in America' (see present edition, Vol.
26), where he raised the problems he had discussed in his correspondence with Kelley-Wischnewetzky (pp.
82, 525, 530, 540-41), and made an incisive analysis of the popu­ lar US economist Henry George.
Engels' correspondence reflects his keen interest in the social-economic and political history of Russia and the Russian revolution­ ary movement.
His chief Russian correspondents in 1883-86 were Nikolai Danielson, Pyotr Lavrov, and Vera Zasulich.
Their let­ ters, along with the periodicals and other literature, were for him a continuous source of information about life in Russia.
Engels saw the specificity of Russia in that there every degree of 'social development is represented, from the primitive commune to modern big industry and high finance, and .
.
.
all these contradictions are forcibly pent up by an unheard-of despotism' (p.
281 ).
He predict­ ed an imminent financial crash and stressed the disaffection among all social groups over the internal situation.
He observed that 'the so-called emancipation of the peasants' in 1861 had not entirely liberated the peasants, with left-overs of feudal relations surviving in the countryside.
As in the 1870s, one of the central subjects in the correspondence between Engels and the Russian revolutionaries was that of the prospects for revolution in Russia.
Engels clearly overestimated the revolutionary sentiment in Russia when he wrote that the Tsar's government was 'at bay' and that the country would soon have its own 1789 (pp.
112, 338).
His optimism was partly sti­ mulated by the activity of Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) revolu­ tionary organisation (pp.
256, 338).
His letter to Vera Zasulich of 23 April 1885 contains his conception of the character and motive forces of the impending revolution in Russia.
He discusses possible revolutionary scenarios, from a palace coup to a people's revolution, which he compares to the Jacobinic dictatorship of 1793 .
When he gave both main dates of the French Revolution, 1789 and 1793, he evidently had in mind the succession of stages in the revolutionary cycle, from the bourgeois to the bour­ geois-democratic revolution (pp.
112, 281).
Like Marx, he was certain that the Russian revolution would tear down tsarism, that 'last stronghold of reaction' (pp.
488-89), and thereby influence the political situation in the rest of Europe, ending tsarism's policy of conquests (pp.
338, 515-16).
The letters show that Engels welcomed the growth of revolutionary forces in Russia and that he established close ties with the first Rus­ sian Marxists in the Emancipation of Labour group.
Nor did he ever deny support to Russian socialists who had trans­ lated into Russian such works as: K.
Marx, The Poverty of Philosophy (1886), Volume II of Capital (1885), and his Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (1884), and so forth.
He commended their professional skill.
In a letter to Sorge of 29 June 1883 he wrote, 'Translating the Mani­ festo is awfully difficult; by far the best renderings I have seen are the Russian' (p.
42).
The correspondence of 1883-1886 is a valuable source of informa­ tion about Engels' life and offers evidence of his boundless respect for Marx.
To perpetuate the memory of his friend, often to the detriment of his then shaky health, he worked from eight to ten hours at his desk, editing Marx's manuscripts (pp.
197, 202, 456, 492).
Conscious of the pressure of his obligations, he wrote to Johann Philipp Becker on 15 October 1884: '.
.
.
My misfortune is that since we lost Marx I have been supposed to represent him.
I have spent a lifetime doing what I was fitted for, namely playing second fiddle, and indeed I be-lieve I acquitted myself reasonably well.
And I was happy to have so splendid a first fiddle as Marx.
But now that I am suddenly expected to take Marx's place in matters of theory and play first fiddle, there will inevitably be blunders and no one is more aware of that than F (p.
202).
The letters produce a vivid and most attractive portrait of Engels, a revolutionary internationalist, theorist, sensitive and responsive friend, a man brimming with energy and optimism.
They testify to his touching affection for Marx's daughters, and his warm concern for such veterans of the labour movement as Friedrich Fessner, Johann Philipp Becker, George Julian Harney, and others.
Volume 47 contains 310 letters by Frederick Engels.
Of these 180 are published in English for the first time; 130 letters have been published in English before, 65 of these in part only.

I shall not be able to cash it until Wednesdaya at the earliest, as tomorrow I have to examine the manuscripts left by Marx.
2 On completion of the commission I shall announce the fact in the Sozialdemokrat of Zurich, and shall ask the editorial department to send you one or two copies ofthat particular number.
It goes without saying that no mention will be made of Citizen Krantz's b name.
3 I have found the manuscript of the Zirkulation des Kapitals 11 and of the third book: Die Gestaltungen des Gesammtprozesses d — some 1,000 in-folio pages.
4 So far it's impossible for me to say whether the manu­ script as it stands is in a fit condition to go to press.
In any case I shall have to copy it out as it is in rough draft.
Tomorrow I shall at last have time enough to devote several hours to going through all the manuscripts that Moor has left us, in particular an outline of dialect­ ics which he had always intended to do.
5 But he always refrained from telling us how far his work had progressed, for he was aware that, once people realised something was ready, he would be pestered until he consented to its publication.
All this is between you and me; I have no right to publish anything without Tussy who is my literary co-executrix.

As to the extra expense, that will not be much and I can soon find you that, if informed in time.
Only, if things are as you describe, it will re­ quire some considerable diplomacy on Paul's part, not to spoil his own game — that Christian sister of charity ought not to be made an enemy of7—she is always there and Paul not, and if only her sus­ picions are aroused, be sure she will never cease to beguile the old woman i«to a will as much in her favour as the law will permit.
So that point I suppose is settled — you'll have to look after the execu­ tion.
We all of us have had a hearty laugh at your account of the Argen-teuil adventures.

9 He was awfully funky about it when here, and amused Liebknecht out of all measure with his horror carceris.
c But if he does not now start in earnest to learn German, I shall consider him to be nothing but un enfant gâté.
d Imagine he writes to me that he will learn it— 'comme vous le dites très bien (!) il pourra (!) devenir nécessaire que je le sache pour des traductions!' .
e As if the perfection of his own accomplishments, bright as they are, did not en­ tirely depend on his reading certain German things, published and unpublished!

Dear Comrade, You must understand that, since the death of my old friend, I have been so taken up with correspondence, business matters, the perusal of his writings, etc.
, that I have been able to attend only to what was absolutely imperative.
2 Today I have at last found a minute or two in which to thank you for your letter of condolence ' ' and for your excellent obituary in Recht voor Allen.
a That obituary was un­ doubtedly one of the best we have seen, and was unanimously ac­ claimed as such among our circle of intimates here.
Many thanks, too, on behalf of his surviving daughtersb and of my­ self, to the Dutch workers' party '2 for their participation, at least in spirit, in our friend's last rites.
In this they were at one with our Ger­ man, French, Spanish, Russian and American comrades.
Should fate or the urge to travel — in our case sadly curbed — bring me to Holland, I shall consider myself under an obligation to look you up, just as I would urge you to look me up should you come to England.
Marx has left a great wad of manuscript for the second part of Capi­ tal, the whole of which I must first read (and what handwriting!) be­ fore I can tell to what extent it is printable and to what extent it re­ quires complementing from subsequent notebooks.
4 At all events, the main substance is there.
Since I cannot as yet say anything more definite, however, I would ask you not to put anything in the papers about it just now, as this might lead to misunderstandings.
Besides, Marx's youngest daughter Eleanor is my literary co-executrix, I can do noth­ ing without her and the ladies, as you know, are sticklers for form.

However, even if found, I should hesitate to send it to you at least for the purpose you indicate.
b I am not aware that it is usual, in the literature of this or any other country, for one author to lend his manu­ scripts to another.
As to our experience of English review-writers it has not been very encouraging.
With the exception of a few clergymen of the Church of England, they have invariably distorted our views and disfigured our actions.
Their utter ignorance of our theory and practice has been equalled only by their presumption.

a K.
Marx, 'Mr George Howell's History of the International Working-Men's Asso­ ciation'.
-b Samuel Moore 10 Marx and I, ever since 1845, have held the view that one of the final results of the future proletarian revolution will be the gradual dissolu­ tion and ultimate disappearance of that political organisation called the State; an organisation the main object of which has ever been to secure, by armed force, the economical subjection of the working ma­ jority to the wealthy minority.
With the disappearance of a wealthy minority the necessity for an armed repressive State-force disappears also.
At the same time we have always held, that in order to arrive at this and the other, far more important ends of the social revolu­ tion of the future, the proletarian class will first have to possess itself of the organised political force of the State and with its aid stamp out the resistance of the Capitalist class and re-organise society.
This is stated already in the Communist Manifesto of 1847, end of Chapter II.
a The Anarchists reverse the matter.
They say, that the Proletarian revolution has to begin by abolishing the political organisation of the State.
But after the victory of the Proletariat, the only organisation the victorious working class finds ready-made for use, is that of the State.
It may require adaptation to the new functions.
b But to de­ stroy that at such a moment, would be to destroy the only organism by means of which the victorious working class can exert its newly conquered power, keep down its capitalist enemies and carry out that economical revolution of society without which the whole victory must end in a defeat0 and in a massacre of the working class like that after the Paris Commune.
Does it require my express assertion, that Marx opposed these anarchist absurdities from the very first day that they were started in their present form by Bakunin? The whole internal history of the International Working Men's Association is there to prove it.
The Anarchists tried to obtain the lead of the International, by the foulest means, ever since 1867 20 and the chief obstacle in their way was Marx.
The result of the five years' struggle was the expulsion, at the Hague Congress, September 1872, of the Anarchists from the Inter­ national, 2 ' and the man who did most to procure that expulsion was Marx.

-b In Der Sozialdemokrat this sentence reads: 'This State may require very important changes before it can fulfil its new functions.
'-0 In Der Sozialdemokrat: 'another defeat'.
Now as to Johann Most.
If any man asserts that Most, since he turned anarchist, has had any relations with, or support from Marx, he is either a dupe or a deliberate liar.
After the first No.
of the London Freiheit had been published, a Most did not call upon Marx and my­ self more than once, at most twice.
Nor did we call on him or even meet him accidentally anywhere or at any time since his new-fangled anarchism had burst forth in that paper.
b Indeed, we at last ceased to take it in as there was absolutely 'nothing in it'.
We had for his an­ archism and anarchist tactics the same contempt as for that of the people from whom he had learnt it.
c While still in Germany, Most published a 'popular' extract of Das Kapital.
d Marx was requested to revise it for a second edition.
I as­ sisted Marx in that work.
We found it impossible to eradicate more than the very worst mistakes, unless we re-wrote the whole thing from beginning to end, and Marx consented his corrections being insert­ ed on the express condition only that his name was never in any way connected with even this revised form of Johann Most's produc­ tion.
e You are perfectly at liberty to publish this letter in the Voice of the People,f if you like to do so.

The Volkszeitung has perpetrated follies enough, though still not as ma­ ny as I expected.
Nevertheless they have all contributed their share, Schewitsch, Cuno, Douai, Hepner.
Here was a quartet performed by would-be know-alls who, JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY, knew damned little.

made it impossible for me to send them any further reports and, in the event of their again venturing to make such misuse of my name, I should be compelled to ask you to announce at once in public that the whole thing was a falsification on their part.
Those gentlemen ought to confine their Yankee HUMBUG to themselves.
Besides, the Americans are far more honest; according to the Volkszeitung, I was sent a tele­ gram 28 which I never received and I was almost inclined to believe that the gentlemen on the Volkszeitung had pocketed the money for themselves.
Now Van Patten writes to say that there hadn't been any money in the first place.
I am now compelled to make this publicly known over here, for otherwise it would be said that I had withheld the telegram from the Paris press and the Sozialdemokrat.
The answer re Most, which I sent Van Patten in response to his enquiry, a will doubtless have already been published by him by the time this ar­ rives.
At the Copenhagen Congress '5 it was resolved that Liebknecht's and Bebel's trip to America should take place next spring.
29 It has to do with money for the election campaign in 1884-85.
(All this is be­ tween ourselves.
) Liebknecht has proposed to Tussy that she should ac­ company him as his secretary and she is very keen to go; so it might easily be that you see her there before long.
Generally speaking we have not made any plans yet.
The literary work (third edition, Volume I of Capital, editing of Volume II, the ms.
of which has been found though as yet there is no knowing to what extent it is ready for printing or requires supplementing, ' 7 biography based on the enormous correspondence,30 etc.
) takes up all my spare time, besides which Tussy has a mass of literary ENGAGEMENTS to get through.
You are, of course, fully entitled to print the passages on Henry George in Marx's letters.
3 ' The question is, however, whether it might not be better to wait until I am able to sort out for you the marginal notes made by Marx in his copy of George's book and then do the whole lot at one go.
Resumes of the kind Marx provides, theo­ retically acute but brief and unaccompanied by examples, are surely still above the head of your average American and after all there is no hurry.
I shall take a closer look at the things as soon as I have time.
If, in the meanwhile, you send me a copy of the relevant passage in Marx's letter, it will make the job simpler.

• ^ ,• , r • r-Published in English for the first time 11 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 34 London, 30 April 1883 Dear Bebel, There is a very simple answer to your question as to whether I might remove to Germany or Switzerland or somewhere else on the Continent, namely that I shall not go to any country from which one can be expelled.
But that is something one can only be safe from in England and America.
I should at most go to the latter country on a visit, unless otherwise compelled.
Hence I shall remain here.
Moreover England has another great advantage.
Since the demise of the International there has been no labour movement whatsoever here, save as an appendage to the bourgeoisie, the radicals and for the pursuit of limited aims within the capitalist system.
Thus, only here does one have the peace one needs if one is to go on with one's theo­ retical work.
Everywhere else one would have had to take part in practical agitation and waste an enormous amount of time.
As re­ gards practical agitation, I should have achieved no more than any-17 one else; as regards theoretical work, I cannot yet see who could take the place of Marx and myself.
What younger men have attempted in this line is worth little, indeed, for the most part less than nothing.
Kautsky, the only one who applies himself to study, has to write for a living and for that reason if no other can achieve nothing.
And now, in my sixty-third year, up to my eyes in my own work and with the prospect of a year's work on the second volume of Capital and another year's work on Marx's biography,30 along with the history of the German socialist movement from 1843 to 1863 and of the Inter­ national from 1864-72,35 it would be madness for me to exchange my peaceful retreat here for some place where one would, have to take part in meetings and newspaper battles, which alone would be enough to blur, as it necessarily must, the clarity of one's vision.
To be sure, if things were as they were in 1848 and 1849, I would again take to the saddle if need arose.
But now — strict division of labour.
I must even withdraw as much as possible from the Sozialdemokrat.
You have only to think of the enormous correspondence, formerly shared out between Marx and myself, which I have had to con­ duct on my own for over a year now.
For after all, we wish to main­ tain intact, in so far as it is in my power, the many threads from all over the world which spontaneously converged upon Marx's study.
As regards a monument to Marx,36 I do not know what ought to be done.
The family is against it.
The simple headstone made for his wife, which now also bears his and his little grandson'sa names, would be desecrated in their eyes if replaced by a monument which, here in London, would be scarcely distinguishable from the pretentious phil-istine monuments surrounding it.
A London cemetery of this kind looks quite different from a German one.
The graves lie closely side by side, not room for a tree between them, and a monument is not al­ lowed to exceed the length and breadth of the small plot that has been bought.
Liebknecht spoke of a complete edition of Marx's writings.
All very well, but Dietz's plan for Volume II has made people forget that that Volume was long since promised to Meissner and that an edition of the other, shorter works would likewise have to be offered to Meissner first, and then could only appear abroad.
After all, even before the Anti-Socialist Law 3 7 it was always said that not even the Communist a Henri Longuet Manifesto could be printed in Germany save in the document read out at your trial.
38 The manuscript of Volume II was completed prior to 1873, prob­ ably even prior to 1870.
17 It is written in German script; after 1873 Marx never used anything but Latin characters.
It is too late for registration, so this letter must go off as it is; how­ ever, I shall seal it with my seal.

All I asked you for originally was a reply, telling me what my legal position was in regard to Wigand.
The 1845 contract envisages a 2nd edition and lays down the fee to be paid for it.
40 Question: 1.
Am / still bound by this? 2.
If so, and if Wigand refuses to print a 2nd edition on the condi­ tions of payment agreed, does that release me outright? I have never been able to get an answer from you to these simple questions and, since you promised to obtain one for me, I can only describe it as 'neglect on your part'.
Never have I instructed you either personally or via a third party to act on my behalf, and I cannot conceive why, at this moment, you took it into your head to set such a thing in motion off your own bat and without even reflecting.
/ would expressly request that you make no move whatever; I should at once write to Wigand and dis­ claim everything.
Meissner has written today; makes no mention at all of publication instalments.
" The contract does not entitle us to interfere here.
But if Dietz can show Meissner that it is to his own advantage, he may do it after all.

But you can see what your absence has made possible.
Some years ago Bracke wrote to me saying: Bebel is, in fact, the only one of us possessed of real parliamentary tact.
42 And I have found this con­ stantly confirmed.
So there's probably no alternative but for you to return to your post at the first opportunity and I should be delighted were you to be elected in Hamburg so that necessity relieved you of your doubts.
43 Certainly, agitational and parliamentary work becomes very bor-a This refers probably to the third German edition of Volume I of Capital.

ing after a time.
It is much the same thing as advertising, puffing one's wares and travelling around are in business: success is slow in coming, and some never achieve it.
But there's no other alternative, and once you are in it you've got to see the thing through to the end, if all your trouble is not to have been for nothing.
And the Anti-Socialist Law 3 7 means that this, the only course to have remained open, simply cannot be dispensed with.
Despite the way it was written, the report on the Copenhagen Con­ gress '5 enabled me to read sufficiently between the lines to amend Liebknecht's, as always rosy, version of things.
a At all events I per­ ceived that the half-and-halfs 44 had suffered a severe defeat and this, I admit, led me to believe that they would now draw in their horns.
Yet such does not seem to be the case, or not to that degree.
We have never been under any illusions about these men.
Neither Hasenclever nor, for that matter, Hasselmann, should ever have been admitted, but Liebknecht's undue haste over unification — against which, at the time, we protested for all we were worth — has landed us with a jackass and also, for a while, with a rascal.
45 In his day, Bios was a lively, courageous chap but after his marriage, etc.
, the stuffing was soon knocked out of him by the difficulty of making both ends meet.
Geiser always was an indolent, self-opinionated fellow and Kayser a big-mouthed commis-voyageur.
h Even in 1848 Rittinghausen was a nonentity; he's only a socialist proforma, in order to enlist our help in achieving his direct government by the people.
But we have better things to do.
What you say about Liebknecht is something you have doubtless long been thinking.
46 We have known him for many years.
Popu­ larity is the very stuff of life to him.
Hence he has got to conciliate and conceal in order to postpone the crisis.
Besides, he's an optimist by nature and sees everything through rose-tinted spectacles.
That's what keeps him so lively and is the main reason for his popularity, but it also has its disadvantages.
So long as I corresponded only with him, not only did he report everything in accordance with his own rosy views, but also withheld everything that was unpleasant and, upon being questioned, replied in such an airy and off-hand way that, more than by anything else, one was unfailingly needled by the thought 'Can the man suppose us so stupid as to be taken in by it?' a Cf.
this volume, pp.
7 and 32.
-b commercial traveller Add to that his incessant busyness, an undoubted asset in day-to-day agitation but involving us over here in a mass of useless letter-writing; a perpetual stream of projects whose only outcome was to burden other people with extra work — in short, as you will understand, all this made a really businesslike and down-to-earth correspondence of the kind I have conducted for years with you as well as with Bernstein a sheer impossibility.
Hence the constant bickering and the honorary title he once jokingly conferred upon me here of being the rudest man in Europe.
My letters to him were, it is true, often rude, but the rude­ ness was conditioned by the contents of his own.
No one knew that better than Marx.
Again, for all his valuable qualities, Liebknecht is a born school­ master.
If a working man in the Reichstag happens to say me instead of I, or pronounce a short Latin vowel as a long one, and the bour­ geois laugh, he's in despair.
Hence he has to have 'eddicated' men, like that weakling Viereck who, with a single speech, would make us look more foolish in the Reichstag than would two thousand wrong 'mes'.
And then, he can't wait.
A momentary success, even if it means the sacrifice of a subsequent, far greater one, takes precedence over everything else.
You people will discover that in America, when you go there in the wake of Fritzsche and Viereck.
47 Their mission was a blunder as great as the over-hasty unification with the Lassalleans who, six months later, would have come to you of their own accord — but as a disorganised gang without their bankrupt leaders.
As you see, I speak to you quite frankly — in confidence.
But I also believe that you would do well firmly to resist Liebknecht's persuasive blandishments.
Then he's bound to yield.
If really confronted by a decision, he will certainly adopt the right course.
But he would rather do so tomorrow than today, and in a year's time rather than tomorrow.
If a few deputies were in fact to vote for Bismarck's Bills, 48 thus planting a kiss on his backside in return for having theirs kicked, and if the parliamentary group4 9 failed to expel these people, I too would, of course, be capable of publicly disassociating myself from a party prepared to tolerate such a thing.
To the best of my knowledge, however, that would be impossible, having regard to existing party discipline whereby the minority has got to vote with the majority.
But you are better informed than I.
Any split that took place while the Anti-Socialist Law is in opera-tion I should look upon as a misfortune, since all means of communi­ cating with the masses have been cut off.
But it may be forced on us and then we shall have to look facts in the face.
So if anything of the sort should happen — no matter where you are — I should be glad if you could inform me and do so at once, for my German papers al­ ways arrive very belatedly.
Bios, when he went to Bremen after being expelled from Hamburg, did indeed write me a very plaintive letter50 to which I sent a very firm reply.
3 9 Now, my papers have for years been in the most shock­ ing muddle, and finding this particular one would be a day's work.
But some time I shall have to put them in order and, if needs be, shall send you the letter in the original.
Your view of the business conditions is being corroborated in Eng­ land, France and America.
5 ' It is an intermediate crisis like that of 1841-42, but on a much vaster scale.
Generally speaking, it is only since 1847 (because of Californian and Australian gold production which resulted in the world market becoming fully established) that the ten-year cycle has clearly emerged.
Now, when America, France and Germany are beginning to break England's monopoly of the world market and when, therefore, overproduction is beginning, as it did before 1847, to assert itself more rapidly, the quinquennial inter­ mediate crises are also recurring.
Proof of this is the complete exhaus­ tion of the capitalist mode of production.
The period of prosperity no longer reaches its full term; overproduction recurs after only 5 years and, even during those 5 years, things in general go downhill.
Which, however, is very far from proving that, between 1884 and 1887, we shan't have a period of pretty brisk trade, as happened between 1844 and 1847.
But then the great crash will quite surely come.

Dear Sir, I have received your pamphlet on Karl Marx.
You are entitled to subject his doctrines to the most stringent criticism, indeed to misun­ derstand them; you are entitled to write a biography of Marx which is pure fiction.
But what you are not entitled to do, and what I shall never permit anyone to do, is slander the character of my departed friend.
Already in a previous worka you took the liberty of accusing Marx of quoting in bad faith.
When Marx read this he checked his and your quotations against the originals and he told me that his were all correct and that if there was any bad faith it was on your part.
And seeing how you quote Marx, how you have the audacity to make Marx speak of profit when he speaks of Mehrwerth,b when he defends himself time and again against the error of identifying the two (some­ thing which Mr Moore and I have repeated to you verbally here in London) I know whom to believe and where the bad faith lies.
This however is a trifle compared to your 'deep and firm convic­ tion.

.
that conscious sophistry pervades them all' (Marx's doctrines); that Marx 'did not baulk at paralogisms, while knowing them to be such', that 'he was often a sophist who wished to arrive, at the expense of the truth, at a negation of present-day society' and that, as Lamartine says, 'il jouait avec les mensonges et les vérités comme les enfants avec les osselets'.
0 53 In Italy, a country of ancient civilisation, this might perhaps be taken as a compliment, or it might be considered great praise among armchair socialists, 54 seeing that these venerable professors could never produce their innumerable systems except 'at the expense of the truth'.
We revolutionary communists see things differently.

In my opinion, it should have been your duty to make known to the public this famous 'conscious sophistry' which pervades all of Marx's doctrines.
But I look for it in vain! Nagott!" What a tiny mind one must have to imagine that a man like Marx could have 'always threatened his critics' with a second volume which he 'had not the slightest intention of writing', and that this sec­ ond volume was nothing but 'an ingenious pretext dreamed up by Marx in place of scientific arguments'.
This second volume exists and it will shortly be published.
Perhaps you will then learn to under­ stand the difference between Mehrwerth and profit.

I had any sort of contact with German publishers apart from Meissner (on account of Capital), let alone with newspapers and peri­ odicals.
So what could I do? Even if the man could translate the other way round, from German into French or English, I should be unable to help him find work.
You would certainly do better to ap­ proach Liebknecht who after all has the Neue Z_eit and connections in plenty.
We shall be saddled with Marx's house until next March, so there is no need to be over-hasty about the removal or plans for the future.
Moreover a tremendous amount of work is involved in getting these papers in order.
What surprises me is that Marx has actually saved papers, letters and manuscripts from the period prior to 1848, splen­ did material for the biography which I shall of course be writing and which, inter alia, will also be the history of the Neue Rheinische Leitung and of the movement of 1848-49 on the Lower Rhine, as well as the history of the rascally emigration in London between 1849 and 1852 and of the International.
30 The first task is the editing of Vol­ ume II of Capital4 and that is no joke.
There are in existence 4 or 5 revisions of Book II, of which only the first is complete, the others having been merely started on "; some labour when you're dealing with a man like Marx, who weighed every word.
But to me it is a labour of love; after all I shall be back again with my old com­ rade.
For the past few days I have been sorting letters from 1842-62.
As I watched the old times pass before my eyes they really came to life again, as did all the fun we used to have at our adversaries' expense.
Many of our early doings made me weep with laughter; they didn't, after all, ever succeed in banishing our sense of humour.
But there were also many very serious moments in between whiles.
This is in confidence; mind you, don't let a word of it get into the papers.
Such information as is ripe for imparting will be published by me from time to time in the Sozialdemokrat.
Bernstein is getting on very well, he is eager to learn, is witty and has an open mind, can put up with criticism and is quite free of all petty-bourgeois moralisings.
But our lads in Germany have also been truly magnificent, ever since the time that the Anti-Socialist Law 3 7 liberated them from the 'ed-dicated' gentlemen who, in their ignorant academic muddle-headedness, had attempted prior to 1878 to instruct the workers from on high, an attempt that was, alas, condoned by all too many of the 17.

This worthless lumber has not yet been entirely cleared away, but the movement has again taken a decidedly revolutionary turn.
That is precisely what is so splendid about our lads, the fact that the masses are far better than almost any of the leaders; and now that the Anti-Socialist Law is compelling the masses to take care of the movement themselves, now that the influence of the leaders is reduced to a minimum, the movement is better than ever.

Now however it is all right, and I hope to hear soon from you that you accept my invita­ tion, to make this place your headquarters for a couple of months at least, which of course will not exclude trips to the sea-side, etc.
If Paul has to be under lock and key, so much the more reason for you to look after your own health.
While Sam was here, we found out, through him, the very unpleas­ ant fact that Mohr never had, nor have we, the right to stop unauth­ orised translation of the Kapital.
The right was lost as soon as the first year elapsed without a commencement of translation being published.
So as there are several fellows in the field, 56 we have to dodge and to use the unpublished 2nd volume as a means to bring them round.
The 2nd volume will give me an awful deal of work — at least the II book.
4 There is one complete text, of about 1868, but a mere brouillon.
a Then there are at least three, if not four, Ueb er arbeitungen b belonging to various later periods, but none of them completed.
That will be a job to select from them a definitive text! The 3rd book is complete since 1869-70 and has never been touched since.
But here, where the rent of land is treated, I shall have to compare his Russian extracts57 for notes, facts and instances.
Maybe I shall be able to con­ coct even a bit of a 3rd volume from the ms.
of 1858-62 58 (the begin­ ning of which appeared in Berlin [in] 1859c) and which at the end of every chapter contains the critical history of the theoretical points discussed in it.
Lately I have been occupied with sorting the correspondence.
There is a large box full of most important letters [from] 1841 (nay 1837 from your grandfather Marxd ) to 1862.
It is nearly sorted, but it will take me some hours more to complete it.
I can assure you it is great fun to me to stumble over these old things most of which con­ cern me as much as they did Mohr and there is such a deal to laugh over.
Nim helps me — awful lot of dusting required! and we have many a good laugh over old times.
The correspondence since 1862 he has sorted, in a passable way, himself.
But before we fathom all the mysteries of that garret full of boxes, packets, parcels, books, etc.
, some time must elapse.
And I have to prepare for the 3rd edition sun­ dry additions from the French translation 59 which I know Mohr in­ tended inserting; and that must be done in 3-4 weeks.

As regards internal matters, I had more or less read between the lines of the official reportb and, soon after, also received a short exposé from Bebel.
Some while previously I had written and told Bebel that there must ultimately be a break with the ninnies of the right wing, c but that in my view it was not in our interests to force it before we were again in a position to consort directly with the masses; i.
e.
not so long as the Anti-Socialist Law remained operative.
37 Should they force our hand, then we should see to it that it was they, not us, who rebelled against party discipline, in which case the game would already be ours.
And they should be brought to do this if they refused to keep quiet.

Let me briefly sum up what I have to do: 1 ) Put the papers in order 2; here almost everything has to be done by myself since no one except me knows about the old stuff, and there's an enormous pile of it in a fine state of disarray.
Much is still missing and a lot of packages and boxes haven't even been opened yet.
2) See to the third edition, with sundry alterations and a few ad­ denda from the French edition.
59 On top ofthat, read the proofs.
3) Take advantage of an opportunity that has presented itself to bring out an English translation — in connection with which I today called on one of the big publishers herea—and then revise the trans­ lation myself 56 (Moore, who will be doing it, is first-rate, a friend of ours for twenty-six years, but slow).
4) Collate the 3 or 4 versions of the beginning of Volume II and prepare them for the press, besides making a fair copy of the whole of the second volume.
'7 5) Spend a week every now and again tippling with Schorlemmer who returned to Manchester yesterday — he always brings some work with him, but o, jerum!h Voilà la vie/ c The jackass in the Vossische (I've been sent the thing d four times) would certainly seem to have disseminated a lot of despondency in good old Germany respecting the despondent Marx.
I might, some time when in really jolly mood, take a kick at him.
Were these oafs to get the chance of reading the correspondence between Moor and my­ self, they'd be speechless with rage.
Heine's poetry is trifling by com­ parison with our impudent, mocking prose.
Moor was capable of be­ coming furiously angry, but down-in-the-mouth—jamais!e I was convulsed when I reread the old stuff.
This correspondence is, by the way, also historically memorable and, in so far as it is in my power, it will end up in the right hands.
Unfortunately I only have the letters Marx wrote after 1849, but those are complete.

235, 1st sup­ plement, 24 May 1883.
-e never! Herewith part of the original draft from the last part of the Commu­ nist Manifesto which you want to keep as a memento.
The first two lines were dictated, and were taken down by Mrs Marx.
62 I would have sent you the enclosed poem by Weerth in time for the feuilleton, had you not so contrived matters that your letter arrived twelve hours too late — as it was, I had to wait and see whether you printed the feuilleton tel quel* Anyhow, you can put it in some­ where else.
63 If only by contrast with the solemn Freiligrath, all of Weerth's stuff is ironical and humorous.
Never any question of 'she-rioushness' here.
As regards the repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law, the chaps in Ger­ many can never see beyond their own noses.
By disappointing Russia (and things are far more acute there) with his proclamation in Mos­ cow just as Frederick William IV disappointed the Prussians in 1841,64 Alexander III has done more towards that end than all your Geisers, Bloses and Co.
could ever do with their lamentations.
If, one fine morning, he is riddled with bullets—as he surely will be — Bismarck's internal régime won't be worth a brass farthing.
Then they'll change their tune.
Even if old William b merely (I don't mean Wilhelm Blos c) kicks the bucket, there will of necessity be changes.
The men of today have never experienced, nor can they possibly imagine, what a crown prince, d grown up in what has in the meantime become a revolutionary situation, is capable of.
And a fool, what's more, as vacillating and weak-willed as 'our Fritz'.
Nor, for that matter, can the possibility be excluded that the crazy French government may fall foul of all the world in such a way as to incite violent action in Paris.
Tunis, Egypt, Madagascar, Tonkin65 — and now they are actually seeking to contest England's possession of a few rocky islands, with barely 50 inhabitants, off the coast of Normandy.
I only hope that nothing happens in Paris, for the stupidity that pre­ vails among the masses there is exceeded only here, in London.
And on top of that the ingenuous Bismarck works for us like the very devil.
His latest theory — that the imperial constitution is noth­ ing but a contract made by governments for which they can substi­ tute another one any old day, without consulting the Reichstag — is a real godsend to us.
Just let him try.
Add to which the manifest intention to bring about a conflict, his stupid, impertinent Bödi-kers & Co.
in the Reichstag — all this is grist to our mill.
True, this a as it stood -b William I -c In Engels' text the parenthesis was a footnote.
In German 'merely' = bloss.
-A Frederick William means the end of the catch-phrase about 'one reactionary mass',66 a phrase generally appropriate only for declamation (or, again, for a truly revolutionary situation).
For it is precisely in this that the quirk of history — one operating in our favour—consists, namely that the dif­ ferent elements of that feudal and bourgeois mass erode, fight with and devour one another, to our advantage and are, therefore, the very op­ posite of that uniform mass which your lout imagines he can dismiss by dubbing the whole lot 'reactionary'.
On the contrary.
All these di­ verse scoundrels must first mutually destroy, utterly ruin and discred­ it each other, and pave the way for us by proving their ineptitude, each lot in turn.
It was one of Lassalle's greatest mistakes, when engaged in agitation, wholly to lose sight of what little dialectics he had learned from Hegel.
Thus, just like Liebknecht, he never saw more than one side and, since the former, for certain reasons, happened to see the right side, he ultimately proved superior to the great Lassalle after all.
The one regrettable thing about the present German bourgeois movement is precisely that the chaps constitute no more than 'one re­ actionary mass', and this has got to stop.
We can make no progress until at least part of the bourgeoisie has been forced over onto the side of a genuine movement, whether by internal or external events.
That is why we have now had enough of Bismarck's regime in its present form, why he can only benefit us by provoking a conflict or resigning and also why the time will come for the Anti-Socialist Law to be done away with by semi-revolutionary or wholly revolutionary means.
All those arguments as to whether the 'Lesser'67 alone should go, or the Law as a whole, or whether the ordinary penal law should be tight­ ened up, seem to me like arguments about the virginity of Mary in partu and post partum* What is crucial is the wider political situation both at home and abroad; and this changes, does not remain as it is to­ day.
In Germany, by contrast, the case is discussed solely on the as­ sumption that present conditions in Germany will persist eternally.
And running parallel with this is an idea, related to that of one reac­ tionary mass, namely that, with the subversion of the present state of affairs, we shall come to the helm.
That is nonsense.
A revolution is a lengthy process, cf.
1642-46 and 1789-93 68; and in order that cir­ cumstances should be ready for us and we for them, all the intermedi­ ate parties must come to power in turn and destroy themselves.
And a during and after parturition then we shall come — and may, perhaps, once more be momentarily routed.
Not that I think this very probable in the normal course of events.
I have today despatched to 'Volksbuchhandlung, Hottingen-Zurich'', a freight forward per CONTINENTAL PARCELS EXPRESS (correspondent of the German and Swiss parcel post), a parcel containing the photographs ordered,b invoice enclosed.
Of the money you should retain the £\lj-credited to my account over there, against 4 frs for snifters trans­ mitted by proxy, subscriptions, etc.
(If, when remitting the balance, it would be more convenient to include a little more or a little less, that would, of course, be ALL RIGHT.
) Over here 500 cartesc and 280 CABI­ NETS are still available — first come, first served.
Not that you have any competitors as yet, save for Dietz.
Just how much is pushed on to me you will realise when I tell you that I have today had to attend, single-handed, to all the details of checking and repacking the photo­ graphs for you and Dietz, and have likewise had to take them to the office (2 1I2 English miles from here).
And then I'm expected to work! Borde is a jackass whom we have known for years; at Marx's house there are a hundred or more of the notebooks he sent him, lying about unopened.
Envoyez-le au diable.
A I shall not come to Switzerland until the continental routes are safer.
After all, there was no certainty of Marx's being able to travel to, or through, France unscathed this summer.
Once one has been expelled, that is that, unless one is prepared to take steps such as I should find impossible.
Don't I know it! You do not, by the way, bore me in the least with internal matters.
Anyone who's abroad can never hear enough about the details of this sort of internal struggle in a workers' party which, despite everything, is the leading one in Europe.
And that kind ofthing is withheld from me on principle by friend Liebknecht, all of whose reports are rosy red, dawn pink, sky-blue and green as the tender leaves of hope.

Dear Sir, I was very pleased to receive your fine Italian translation of my So­ cialism: Utopian and Scientific.
70 I have been through it and I have suggested minor alterations in a number of places, although I am dif­ fident and aware that my Italian is imperfect and that I am out of practice.
I hope that despite this you can understand the translation (into Italian or French) of the additions to the first German edition which I have inserted at the corresponding points in your manu­ script.
I am enclosing a copy of the recently published German edition, and a copy of the 2nd edition, which is going to press at the moment, will follow.
25 I am sorry that the translation could not have been made from the German text, since Italian is much better suited than French to the dialectical mode of presentation.
Thank you for your kind offer to send me several copies of the translation; six, or at most a dozen, will be enough.
Yours respectfully, Fred.
Engels I am sending by the midday post a registered parcel containing 1) your manuscript, 2) the copy of the German edition.

Printed according to the original Published in English for the first time 23 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 24 June 1883 My dear Laura, When you spoke of your knowledge of what poor Moor's views and wishes had been at Vevey,7 ' it was in connection with dispositions of a more or less testamentary nature, and I therefore naturally con­ cluded that you alluded to similar subjects.
And as those might comprise wishes as to what should be done with some mementos of your Mama, etc.
, books and so forth, and as here we are bound to come to some conclusion or other, and Tussy moreover seems to shun respon­ sibility of acting on her own hook, I thought it my clear duty to in­ form you, so that, in case you had anything to communicate, it could be done in time.
After poor Mohr's death, on my inquiry, Tussy informed me that he had told her, she and I were to take possession of all his papers, and procure the publication of what was to be published, especially the 2nd volume" and the mathematical works.
72 The 3rd German editionb is in hand, I am looking after that too.
If you wish to have Mohr's exact words, Tussy will no doubt give them to you if you ask her to do so.
This matter was talked about here when Paul was here, and I am almost certain he is aware of it.
As to the expression, literary executors, I am alone responsible for it.
I could not find another at the time, and if by it I have in any way offended you, I humbly ask your pardon.
73 How the disposition itself can wound you, I cannot see.
The work must be done here on the spot.
The real work, that you know as well as Tussy does, will mostly have to be done by me.
But as Mohr had one daughter living in London, I find it but natural that he should associ­ ate her to me in such work as she could do.
Had you been living here instead of in Paris, all the three of us would have been jointly ap­ pointed, no doubt about that.
a of Capital -b of the first volume of Capital But there is another view of the case.
According to English law (which we had explained by Sam Moore) the only person living which is the legal representative of Mohr, in England, is Tussy.
Or rather the only person who can become his legal representative by taking out letters of administration.
This must be done by the next of kin living in England—Tussy; unless she declines and proposes some­ one else, who also must reside in the United Kingdom.
So that legally I too am out of it.
For various reasons these letters of administration have to be taken out.
Of the projects Mohr discussed with you at Vevey I was of course utterly ignorant and only regret you did not come over since the 14th March, when we should have known and complied with them as much as possible.
But here is how the matter stands with regard to the English translation.
a We find (from Sam.
Moore as well as from Meissner) that we have no right to stop anyone from publishing an un­ authorised translation.
That right, in the best of cases, lasts but three years after first publication and lapsed finally in 1870.
Now there were several people in the field and a well-meaning but poor and un­ businesslike publisher, Reeves, the most undesirable man of all, told Radford he had found a translator and was going to publish his trans­ lation.
There was then no time to lose.
We must find someone wil­ ling and able to do the work — we could think of no one but Sam.
Moore and of Kegan Paul and Co.
as publishers.
The two entered into correspondence, then Tussy saw Kegan Paul, then I.
Nothing is concluded, but very probably we shall come to some agreement.
The question is: would you, under the altered circumstances, have under­ taken to do the translation and bind yourself to a given time, say 6 months? As to the History of the International, I am perfectly willing, as far as /am concerned, that all papers, etc.
, relating to the International be handed over to you for that purpose.
But my plan was to write a full biography of Mohr,30 and if you take those papers, that falls to the ground.
Mohr's life without the International would be a dia­ mond ring with the diamond broken out.
I have said nothing to Tussy about your letter, as I do riot wish to interfere in any way between two sisters.
Therefore, if you require any explanations from her, you will please write direct to her.
But I think a Of the first volume of Capital; see this volume, p.
29.
the best thing you could do, is to come over and have the matter mu­ tually explained.
You know very well there is on my part no other desire but to consider your wishes as much as possible and in every re­ spect.
And I am the same in the case with Tussy.
If you wish to have your name associated to ours in the common work, and if you wish to share this work, and means can be found how, I for one shall only be glad ofthat.
As it is we shall want your assistance often enough for in­ formation, etc.
, and nothing could throw greater obstacles in our way than fresh unpleasantness between you and Tussy.
What we all of us are desirous of seeing carried out, is a befitting monument to the memory of Mohr, the first portion of which will and must be the publica­ tion of his posthumous works.
Let us then all contribute what we can towards that end.
The only person to whom I have spoken about this matter is Nim and she is quite of the opinion expressed above.
As to our two martyrs,a they seem happy and contented enough, and even afraid of Grévy's putting an end to their prison-bliss on the 14th July.
9 What a fine sentence that on Louise Michel!74 Fortu­ nately nobody knows who will rule France a couple of years hence.
A shell between the legs of Alexander III, and all prison doors in Europe and Asia fly open except — the Irish ones.
Now I must conclude.
I have to read proof-sheets No.
4 of 3rd edi­ tion1' which arrived here on Saturday0 and I have bound myself to re­ turn them in 48 hours.
Then I have to work at the alterations for 3rd edition (done up to page 404) partly upon an annotated copy,75 partly upon the French edition,59 which must be done quick so as not to give excuse for delay.
So no more at present.
Ever yours affectionately, F.

The critique of Henry George, which Marx sent you, is essentially a work of such extraordinary skill and stylistically so much all of a piece, that it would be a pity to tone it down by including the desul­ tory marginal comments that appear in English in Marx's copy.
a These will always be to hand in case of need later on.
Every word of the letter he sent you was written, as was usually Marx's custom on such occasions, with an eye to the subsequent publication of the text.
So you will not be guilty of any indiscretion if you have it printed.
If it is to come out in English, I will translate it for you, since the transla­ tion of the Manifesto 1" has again shown that there seems to be no one over there who can translate our German, at any rate, into literary, grammatical English.
77 This calls for a writer with practice in both languages, practice, what's more, that is not merely confined to the daily press.
Translating the Manifesto is awfully difficult; by far the best renderings I have seen are the Russian.
78 The 3rd edition of Capita? is causing me a tremendous amount of work.
We have one copy in which Marx follows the French edition59 when indicating the emendations and additions to be made,75 but all the detailed work remains to be done.
I have got as far as 'Accu­ mulation',d but here it is a case of revising almost completely the en­ tire theoretical section.
On top of that there is the responsibility.
For to some extent the French translation lacks the depth of the German text; Marx would never have written in German in that way.
More­ over the publisher keeps pressing me.

Part VII of the first volume of Capital urne II.
There are in existence at least four versions of the beginning, thus often did Marx apply himself to the task, the editing of the defi­ nitive work having been interrupted on each occasion by illness.
How the arrangement and conclusion of the last, dating from 1878, will agree with the first, which goes back to before 1870, I cannot yet say.
' 7 Practically everything has been saved from the period up to 1848.
Not only virtually all of the mss he and I worked on at the time (in so far as they haven't been eaten by mice), but also the correspondence.
Everything after 1849 is also complete, of course, and, from 1862 on, is actually in some sort of order.
Also extensive written material on the International, sufficient, I imagine, for a full history, though I have not yet been able to take a closer look at it.
There are also 3 or 4 notebooks of mathematical studies.
I once showed your Adolf 3 an example of Marx's new explanation of differential calculus.
79 Had it not been for the mass of American and Russian material80 (there are over two cubic metres of books of Russian statistics alone), Volume II would have long since been printed.
These detailed stu­ dies held him up for years.
As always, everything had to be brought right up to date and now it has all come to nothing, apart from his ex­ cerpts which will, I trust, include many of his customary critical com­ mentaries for use as notes to Volume II.
The photographs are hereb; as soon as I can find time to pack them I shall send them to you.
But how? BOOK POST precludes any stout packing, no parcel post exists as yet,.
and to send a small package like this per parcels agency would cost a mint of money.
Perhaps you would let me know how best to go about it.
I have already read five sheets of the final proof of the 3rd edition; the man has promised to send three sheets a week.

Engels I haven't possibly got time to answer little Hepner's many long let­ ters just now.

If America's energy and vitality were backed by Europe's theoretical clarity, you would get everything fixed up within ten years.
But that is, after all, an his­ torical impossibility.

82 As soon as I saw my way clear, I sent Percy (last Wednesday") over here to look out for apartments.
He did his business well, and found excellent accommodation, not with­ out difficulty.
Two doors from the Parade, facing the Pier, fine rooms, no sun more than is wanted, good sea-view, good cooking, the only thing we are sorry for is that it could not be arranged in time for you to go with us.
On Friday we arrived here, Pumps, babies and girl, Nim, Jollymeier (who felt a little out of sorts again but has picked up here at once and will soon leave us) and myself.
First-class Scotch mist on arrival, fine rain off and on all night, very encouraging! But next day splendid, so that we could take our walks under the trees and show Nim a little of the place.
To-day, Sunday, fine morning but ' 15 August becoming foggy, well we must take our chance, but anyhow so far the place looks quite different to what it did in the rainy weather when last here.
83 There has been an immense deal of building, the lodging part of the town has about doubled in size, all the fields towards Beachy Head and a good deal of the slope are built over.
Pilsener Beer is flourishing and better even than in London.
Nim and Pumps find things cheaper and better here than at home.
Emily Rosher's little avortorf died yesterday, best thing it could do.
I wrote to Deville at once announcing arrival of his ms.
b At the same time or a little after I got also Sam Moore's translation0 — so I shall have plenty to do here, besides working off my colossal arrears of correspondence.
The place is very full, but the style of the people seems to be more 'free and easy' than formerly.
Even on Sunday morning the chimney­ pot hat plays but a very poor part, and 'athletic' costumes run about pretty free.
Just now the whole party throng in again, awfully thirsty, Jolly-meier has to open the Pilsener, and you conceive that it is no use struggling against the difficulties crowding upon me and stopping not only rational but even irrational correspondence.
The second bottle has just been opened, the little girl is crawling about my knees, and so I give it up in despair.
The whole colony send their kindest regards to you and Paul whose half-term we shall celebrate the day after tomor­ row 9 in an extra draft of Pilsener.

82 Mrs Marx died on 2 December 1881, Jenny on 9 January 1883.
Both deaths were reported in the Sozialdemokrat} 1 The Paris Vorwärts! was a little sheet which is now being accorded more importance than it deserves; the editors were a dilatory lot.
Marx's main concern was to keep it on the right lines and from time to time he also wrote polemical articles and reviews attacking the Prussians.
0 Heine sent Marx some of the advance proofs of the Winter­ märchen from Hamburg for publication in the Vorwärts! before the book appeared in Germany.
86 I actually only set eyes on a few numbers and the little paper did not survive for long, so I cannot let you have any further de­ tails.
Marx wrote quite a lot of things for the Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung, including a polemical discourse against Heinzen.
d Bebel's letter safely received; will be answered from here6; along with all the other correspondence, have been unable to attend to it because of overwork.
Tell Bebel that Schorlemmer, who is here, will be going to Darmstadt shortly and staying there until about the mid­ dle of September.

I do not know much about Ahn's method, and the dictionary you mention is entirely unknown to me.
In order to learn a language the method I have always followed is this: I do not bother with grammar (except for declensions and conjugations, and pronouns) and I read, with a dictionary, the most difficult classical author I can find.
Thus I began Italian with Dante, Petrarch and Ariosto, Spanish with Cervantes and Calderon, Russian with Pushkin.
Then I read newspa­ pers, etc.

" I am still hoping that the news — and it wouldn't be the first time — is being exaggerated by his family.
But he is, of course, very old, has been through a great deal and, or so I was told by Mme Lafargue, looked considerably older last year in Geneva by comparison with his hearty appearance at The Hague.

The post leaves here at one o'clock in the afternoon and here beside me, for proof-reading, lies sheet 19 of Capital* which also has to go off.
a Johann Philipp Becker-1" of the third German edition of Volume I of Capital Many thanks for your suggestion about Kaler-Reinthal,90 but I cannot, unfortunately, take advantage of it.
With the exception of trifles, all my extra jobs are of a kind that call for my personal atten­ tion.
And in so far as I could pass anything on, it would have to be to a man who spoke coulant English and was intimately acquainted with London and local conditions, thus being able to save me run­ ning errands.
I am staying here until about 12 September,82 until when the above address holds good; then back to London.
Besides proofs and arrears of correspondence, I must, while here, attend to: 1) Deville's ms.
, French popularisation of Capital.
® :1 2) Ms.
, part of the English translation,b both of them sorely in need of revision.
So you see, no peace here either.
Luckily I live right next to the sea and sit besides an open window through which the sea air comes wafting in.
I was very sorry that you didn't come over here.
I had a number of things to discuss with you.
We have in any case got to resign ourselves to the fact that some of Marx's unpublished works will have to appear abroad0 and you alone could give me practical information or sugges­ tions relating to this; it is, however, something that has to be discussed verbally — by letter it would be endless.
But please say nothing about this, otherwise it might arouse false hopes in the people who run the printing works out there; my experience of party presses is such that I would think twice before entrusting a major and important work to any of them.
I shall retain the money order here, it being expressly stated thereon that it is of no use to the recipient.
I gave your address, 137 alte Landstraße Riesbach, from memory; if wrong, please put this right at the main post office in Zurich.
My suggestion about the impudent ms.
was, as it were, a bad joke.
d So long as the Anti-Socialist Law is in force,37 and the Sozialdemokrat is the only possible organ, it is imperative not to sow discord among the party merely for the sake of such secondary issues, and that is what would happen if one sought to make a 'question of principle' out of this issue.

It would seem to me that, in the treatment of the 'republic', espe­ cially in France, the most important aspect did not emerge clearly enough in the Sozialdemokrat, 91 namely this: In the class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie, the Bo-napartist monarchy (the characteristics of which have been expound­ ed by Marx in the Eighteenth Brumaire and by myself in The Housing Question, II, and elsewhere) adopted a role similar to that of the old absolute monarchy in the struggle between feudalism and bourgeoi­ sie.
But just as that struggle could not be fought out under the old, ab­ solute monarchy but only under a constitutional one (England, France 1789-92 and 1815-30) so, too, that between bourgeoisie and proletariat can only be fought out in a republic.
Inasmuch, then, as the French were helped by favourable conditions and revolutionary antecedents to overthrow Bonaparte and establish a bourgeois repub­ lic, 92 they have the advantage over us, who remain stuck in a farrago of semi-feudalism and Bonapartism, of already possessing the form in which the struggle must be fought out and which we must first master for ourselves.
Politically they are a whole stage ahead of us.
Hence, the inevitable consequence of a monarchist restoration in France would be that the struggle for the restoration of the bourgeois republic would again appear on the agenda; continuance of the republic, on the other hand, means mounting intensification of the direct, un­ disguised class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie until a crisis is reached.
Similarly in our case the first, immediate result of the revolution can and must, so far as form is concerned, be nothing other than a bour­ geois republic.
But in this instance it will be no more than a brief, transitional period since fortunately we do not possess a purely repub­ lican bourgeois party.
A bourgeois republic with, perhaps, the Party of Progress 9 3 at the helm, will serve us at first to win over the great mass of the workers to revolutionary socialism — which will have been effected in a year or two — and will be conducive to the thorough erosion and self-destruction of all possible intermediate parties but not ours.
Only then can we successfully take over.
The great mistake made by the Germans is to imagine the revolu­ tion as something that can be achieved overnight.
In fact it is a pro­ cess of development on the part of the masses which takes several years even under conditions that tend to accelerate it.
Every revolu­ tion that has been achieved overnight has merely ousted a reaction-ary regime doomed from the outset (1830) or has led directly to the exact opposite of what was aspired to (1848, France).

E What do you think of this: 'The last so-called red number of the "Rheinische Zeitung"" (third edition) of 19 May 1849, which carried the Neue Rheinische ^eitung'% farewell message by Ferdinand Freiligrath at the top of its front page, was again confiscated by the police here not long ago.
A second-hand dealer had bought as waste paper a number of copies of this last farewell issue of the sometime organ of democracy and was selling them at 10 pfennigs a piece.
The police put a stop to this by confiscating such of the papers as the dealer still had left.
If the confiscation was effected on the grounds that the sheet's wretched pale red print was bound to harm its readers' eyes, the public has cause to thank the police; today, the text would be most unlikely to inflame anyone's feelings.

-c of the third German edition of Volume I of Capital voluminous addenda; by the end of the year the thing will be out.
As soon as I am back I shall get down to Volume 2 in real earnest and that is an enormous task.
Alongside parts that have been completely finished are others that are merely sketched out, the whole being a brouillon a with the exception of perhaps two chapters.
Quotations from sources in no kind of order, piles of them jumbled together, col­ lected simply with a view to future selection.
Besides that there is the handwriting which certainly cannot be deciphered by anyone but me, and then only with difficulty.
' 7 You ask why I of all people should not have been told how far the thing had got.
It is quite simple; had I known, I should have pestered him night and day until it was all fin­ ished and printed.
And Marx knew that better than anyone else.
He knew besides that, if the worst came to the worst, as has now happened, the ms.
could be edited by me in the spirit in which he would have done it himself, indeed he told Tussy as much.
95 As regards the photograph,b the head is quite excellent.
The pose is stiff, as in all his photographs; he was a bad 'sitter'.
It does not irritate me in any way but, because of the stiffness of the pose, I prefer the smaller one to the larger.
The election in Hamburg96 has also created a great sensation ab­ road.
But then the behaviour of our chaps could not have been more exemplary.
Such tenacity, perseverance, flexibility and ready wit, such waggish confidence of winning in the struggle with the greater and lesser miseries of the Germany of today, is unprecedented in recent German history.
Especially splendid is the contrast it presents to the corruption, flabbiness and general decay of all other classes of German society.
The very extent to which these classes demonstrate their inability to rule brings out in brilliant relief the ruling mission of the German proletariat, its ability to overturn the whole sordid old mess.
The 'jets of cold water' directed by Bismarck on Paris97 are be­ coming ridiculous, even in the eyes of the French bourgeois.
Even a paper as stupid as the Soir has discovered that nothing more is in­ volved dian the new appropriations in the Reichstag for the military (this time the field artillery).
0 As for his alliances (he has descended to Serbia, Romania and now Spain of all places98), all these are houses built of cards that will be blown down by a puff of wind.
If he's lucky he won't need them and if he's unlucky they will land him in a draft-b of Marx-c Le Soir, 29 August 1883.
the cart.
The greater a blackguard a man is, the more he believes in the uprightness of others and that, in the end, is his undoing.
It is un­ likely to get to that stage with Bismarck so far as his foreign policy is concerned, for the French won't do him the favour of picking a quar­ rel.
Only the Tsara might try something of the kind out of despera­ tion and come to grief in the process.
But I hope he will come to grief at home before that.
The manifesto of the Democratic Federation in London" has been issued by some 20-30 little societies which, under various names (always the same people), have been persistently trying to look im­ portant for the past 20 years at least and always with the same lack of success.
All that is important is that these people have now at last been compelled publicly to proclaim our theory as their own, a theory which, at the time of International, seemed to them to have been imposed upon them from outside, and further that a number of young people have lately emerged from amongst the bourgeoisie who, to the shame, be it said, of the English workers, understand these things better and embrace them more enthusiastically than do the workers.
For even in the Democratic Federation the workers have accepted the new programme for the most part no more than reluc­ tantly and outwardly.
Hyndman, the head of the Democratic Fede­ ration, is an ex-Conservative, an ambitious man, hopelessly jingoistic but not stupid.
He behaved pretty shabbily b towards Marx (to whom he had been introduced by Rudolf Meyer), and for that reason has been personally ignored by us.
100 On no account whatever allow yourself to be bamboozled into believing that a real proletarian move­ ment is afoot here.
I know that this is what Liebknecht would have himself and the rest of the world believe, but it is not so.
The elements presently active might become important, now that they have accept­ ed our theoretical programme and thus acquired a basis, but only if a spontaneous movement broke out amongst the workers here and they succeeded in gaining control of it.
Until then they will continue to be so many isolated individuals with, behind them, an omnium-gatherum of muddle-headed sects, the remnants of the great move­ ment of the forties, ' ° ' but nothing more.
A really universal labour movement will come about here — barring the unexpected — only when the workers become sensible of the fact that England's world a Alexander III -b The words 'ziemlich schofel' ('pretty shabbily') were crossed out in the original and 'nicht schön' ('not nicely') written above them in an unknown handwriting.
monopoly has been broken.
Participation in the domination of the world market was and is the economic basis of the English workers' political nullity.
As the appendage of the bourgeois in the economic exploitation of this monopoly, though nevertheless participating in the advantages that accrue from the said exploitation, they are, in the nature of things, a political appendage of the 'Great Liberal Party' which, for its part, courts them in minor matters, acknowledges TRADES UNIONS and STRIKES as legitimate factors, has abandoned the struggle for an unlimited working day, and enfranchised most of the better paid workers.
' °2 But once America and the combined competi­ tion of the other industrial nations have made a sizeable breach in this monopoly (imminent in the case of iron, less so, unfortunately, in that of cotton), just wait and see what happens here.
I asked Liebknecht to tell you a that, if you happened to be in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt between now and 12 September, you should advise Schorlemmer who is staying there, so that he can look you up somewhere in that region.
It is probably too late now.
Regards to Liebknecht.

The paltry little flysheet and the failure of the motion on the right to work are not enough; they must express themselves in yet stronger terms if we are to get a proper hold On them and if they are not to lie their way out by pleading false excuses.
Meanwhile it would be most helpful if you would gather together material in this connection, for the moment will come when we shall have to have a go at these gentlemen.
There's no immediate hurry.
a Bebel and the Sozialdemokrat, as you say yourself, have got the masses behind them, and there is, after all, an antidote to hand.
That you have a great deal of this sort ofthing to put up with in that Swabian hole, I can well believe, considering that Stuckert b and Munich are the worst places in Germany.
And then, I definitely have not got the time to become embroiled in a dispute that would demand a great deal of toil and trouble.
If it has got to be — well and good.
I return the flysheet herewith.
Lack of time precludes my engaging in further detailed discussion of the articles on marriage.
105 In any case, primitive hetaerism is so remote in time and has been so much overlaid by later developments, whether progressive or otherwise, that nowadays we can nowhere ex­ pect to find examples in their pristine form.
But all subsequent forms lead back to those primitive origins.
Of this much I am certain,— until you have completely dropped the element of jealousy as a deter­ mining social factor (in primitive times), it will not be possible to give a correct account of the way things have developed.
Generally speaking, in the case of all those scientific researches which embrace so wide a field and such a mass of material, nothing can really be achieved except by dint of many years of study.
Indivi­ dual aspects that are both new and accurate — and these are, of course, to be found in your articles — present themselves more read­ ily; but to survey the whole and to order it anew is something that can only be done after it has been fully explored.
Otherwise there would be many more books like Capital.
So I am glad to see that you have turned to themes — for immediate literary treatment — such as early biblical history0 and colonisation,01 which make it possible to achieve something without so exhaustive and detailed a study, and yet at the same time strike a topical note.
I liked the colonisation arti­ cle very much.

German which, as usual, is toned down and fails to present either the lurid hues of tropical colonisation or its most recent mode.
The latter is colonisation, directly and wittingly carried out in the interest of stock-market manipulations, as now by France in Tunisia and Tongking.
65 Of this there is a new and striking instance in the South Seas slave trade; that trade was the immediate purpose of the attempt­ ed annexation of New Guinea, etc.
, by Queensland.
Almost on the same day as the expedition set out to annex New Guinea, a Queens­ land vessel, the Fanny, left for the same island and others further east in order to seize LABOUR, returning, however, without LABOUR but with wounded as well as other unpleasant signs of an encounter.
106 The Daily Mews reports this and, in a leading article,a remarks that the British can hardly censure the French for such practices while doing the same thing themselves! (Beginning of September.
) Last week, at the TRADES UNIONS CONGRESS sitting at Nottingham, Adam Weiler's proposal to press for international factory legislation was thrown out by 26 votes to 2 on the motion of the 'Labour' parlia­ mentarian Broadhurst.

The journal itself, of course, has to content with appalling difficulties: the censorship it has to impose upon itself is a thousand times worse than the old, official censor­ ship used to be.
You still have some pretty odd contributors and you yourself must often enough long for better ones.
At all events, this business has for you the advantage of enabling you at the same time to pursue your scientific studies and let them come to gradual frui­ tion.
Incidentally, Java provides proof of the fact that nowhere and at no time does a population increase so rapidly as under a not unduly oppressive system of bondage: 1755—2 mill.
; 1826—5'/2 mill.
; 1850—9 mill.
; 1878—19 mill.
; — an almost tenfold increase in 125 years—the only example of anything like Malthusian growth.
Were they to send the Dutch blood-suckers packing the population would become fairly stable.

I was besides busy with Sam Moore's specimen translation3 the greater part of which is very good and lively; the beginning — rather a difficult chapterb — wanted a deal of'look after', on account of his not having been exact enough in rendering the terminology, but that could be easily settled.
I am certain from what I have seen that he will do the job well.
I also began revising Deville's pamphlet,81 it requires more work, especially in the beginning where great precision is necessary, but is wanting here and there.
However I shall have no difficulty in setting that right, only it will take a week or a fortnight.
I shall set to work ser­ iously to-morrow.
As far as I have gone, I am much pleased with his work, he has well understood everything (except small details) and it is written in a more lively style than I thought it would be.
As soon as that is shaken off I begin with the 2nd volume [of] Kapital.
I hope you received my post-card ' ' ' with the information you had asked me for.
It was sent the day after I received your letter.

81 I cannot find his letter with his address.
The defect of the thing is that many parts of it have been done rather too hurriedly.
This is princi­ pally the case with the descriptive portions (especially manufacture and grande industrie").
The points do not at all come out as they ought to do.
It is not sufficient to express them, as much as possible, in Marx's own words; these cannot be torn from the context without giving rise to misinterpretation or leaving many things in comparative obscu­ rity.
Deville would do well to revise these two chapters throughout and to complete them by some of the exemplifications of the original without which they have become very abstract and to working-men-readers obscure.
In the theoretical parts there are also many slight inaccuracies (some too, as his definition of marchandise^ very serious) and des choses faites à la hâte, c but these it was mostly not very difficult to set more or less right.
Then many portions, of interest and importance for theoretical economic science, but without immediate portée d on the question between capital and labour, might be omitted.
One or two I have indicated.
Now then I close.

But I was not allowed to sit long at the desk, and had to write — as you will allow — to Deville first.
39 So I could only say a few words to you and these must have looked very unkind indeed.
Pardon me.
Well, I have made up my mind d'en finir avec cette sacrée maladie chronique.
* Since last Wednesday night b I have stayed in bed, in order to do away with any excuse for the constant cause of all my relapses, want of rest and temptation for moving about.
To-day I feel quite well, and inclined for a dance.
But that is just the time when absolute rest is most needed, and therefore I shall not stir out of bed until bed will do me more harm than good.
If nothing unexpected occurs, I think I shall be en pleine guérison c before the week is out.
So now, that will satisfy you I hope as far as my health is concerned.
I perfectly understand what Jollymeier meant by his letter to you.
Gumpert had given him the note of warning — awfully exaggerated, though, for my case — but Gumpert could not interfere in my treat­ ment by another doctor.
Still I think Jollymeier might have found another way to save Gumpert's scruples as to medical étiquette with­ out frighteningjo«.
As it is, I have used your letter to stir up my doc­ tors a bit, and with success.
Ich hab' ihnen Beine gemacht? and energetic treatment is now all the rage.
But enough of that.
All I am sorry for, and very sorry, is that I res­ ponded in such an unkind way to your letter and to the kind feeling which had dictated it.
It has weighed on my mind all the time, and yet I would not again write to you until I could indicate a decided improvement and good reasons for an approaching final cure.
Fortin has written, he wants a preface e and asks about 20 questions which it would take a year to answer thoroughly.
Tussy was here when his letter came, I read it to her and I wish you could have heard a to get rid of this accursed chronic ailment-b 10 October-1 fully fit -d I made them get a move on-' to the French edition of Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte; see also this volume, p.

us laugh at that never ending series of inquiries, each requiring a volume to answer it completely.
I shall ask him to send me the manu­ script" and put off the rest for better times.
Read to-day proof-sheetb up to page 600.
Tussy has promised to look up the American reports for Paul.
' '4 It is getting post-time and dinner-time too.
But before concluding: Deville writes to say he has no time to recast the 3 chapters indicated by me.
8 ' Please do, you and Paul, as much as you can, to get him to revise them as much as possible.
Such as they are, they are not intelli­ gible but to those who know the original.
He says the publisher will give no time.
But the whole cannot be printed at once!! A fortnight will do it and it will be a wonderful improvement.

Hence my silence.

I hope your article will commit the chaps to this course.
If the Germans in Paris have not had their eyes opened to Malon & Co.

Their open alliance with the trai­ tors of the English labour movement, the official representatives of the TRADES UNIONS, has earned them the applause of the entire English bourgeois press from The Times and The Daily News to The Stand­ ard.

Dear Citizen, I am not really in a position to answer the questions you have been so good as to put to me.
' '6 The publication of the second volume of Capital^ in the original text, continues to be delayed.
Up till now I have had to confine my attention mainly to the 3rd edition of the first volume.
" So far I have heard nothing at all from St Petersburg in regard to a Russian translation of the 2nd volume.
Nor, for that matter, do I believe that, as things are now, there could be any question of pub­ lishing a work of this kind in the Russian capital; no doubt they would first want to take a look at the German text.
On the other hand, the political situation in Russia is now so tense that a crisis might supervene any day.
I even think it probable that the press will be free in Russia before it becomes so in Germany.
And in that case the translator of the first volume, TepMaHT.
Aona-THHT),b could, with some reason, claim the right to translate the se­ cond.
1 1? I do not, therefore, believe that the time is yet ripe for an attempt to arrive at a final decision on this matter, but must thank you sin­ cerely for your kind offer which I shall bear in mind.
Perhaps we shall be able to see things more clearly in a month or two, and then we can renew our discussion on the subject.
It pleases me very much to hear that it is you who have under­ taken to translate my Entwicklung etc.
c; I look forward eagerly to seeing your work and fully appreciate the honour you have done me.

Engels Printed according to the original Translated from the French Published in English for the first time 37 ENGELS TO MAX QUARCK IN RUDOLSTADT London, 13 November 1883 Dear Sir, I have kept you waiting a long time for an answer.
a Firstly because I had to keep to my bed on account of a mild but tedious indisposi­ tion and, secondly, because you are not the first to have approached me about the matter in question.
Hence, before I could reply to you, I had to make further inquiries.
The result is that Mr Eduard Bernstein of Zurich has now definitely expressed his intention of translating The Poverty etc.
into German and has enlisted my support.
' ' 8 This I cannot possibly refuse, since he was the first to speak to me about the matter, his qualifications for the task are known to me, and immediate printing in Zurich is assured, should it become apparent that publication in Germany itself might meet with difficulties.
Under the circumstances, and in the knowledge that neither I nor anyone else is legally empowered to prevent you or others from pub­ lishing a translation of that work, I have nothing further to say other a See this volume, p.

a As to Quarck,b you have taken a load off my mind.
' '9 I have writ­ ten telling him that you were the first to apply and that you would be translating The Poverty etc.
' '8 The man has thus been disposed of.
His pamphlet0 is 'Quarck'.
d Marx would wring my neck were I to agree to his being translated by this boastful Hohenzollern-wor-shipper and conservative state socialist.
But it behoves us to make a proper job of it.
Nothing pedestrian; the thing is by no means so easy.
You might, if you have got as far, send me the ms.
of the first sheet; that would give us an opportunity to agree upon the whole modus operandi.
I have not been sent Plekhanov's pamphlet6; only the Manifesto and Wage Labour and Capital} From this I learn that it has appeared in a German edition.
120 Why has no one deigned to send me and Marx's heirs a copy? Nor have I ever received a copy of the new edition of the Manifesto " See this volume, pp.

Of the portraits of me in existence there is only one that you have got; I don't imagine that the man (in Brighton) would quote a cheap price for prints in bulk, but I shall do what I can.
So you see, / bear no grudge against your office,0 but their worships could well be a little less touchy about a bad joke, especially since they devote a full half column of every number to that kind of thing.
Beware of the Droit à la paresse.
12 2 Parts of it were too much even for the French and it was much exploited by Malon and Brousse at Lafargue's expense.
You must certainly see to it that the wailers 123 are not provided with an easy excuse just now; even friend Bebel is still somewhat Germanic in this respect.
Which reminds me of the poem about the 'arse'.
If the author is responsible for all the heroic deeds enumerated therein, he is entitled to celebrate them in song.
Besides, I am speaking of the sex organs, and it is difficult for me to enter into discussion with people who include their bottoms under that heading.
It certainly must have been hard for our friend Lavrov to have set his hand to a document saying that he and his Russians 'had definitive­ ly broken with their anarchist traditions'.
124 Not that he set much store by them, but all the same there was about them something at­ tractively 'Russian'.
Besides, he is a thoroughly honest old fellow who is, however, invariably the hen that hatches out ducks' eggs in the form of 'Russian youth' and watches aghast as the ducklings set out across the HORRIBLE water.
This has happened to him umpteen times.

Der Sozialdemokrat 69 39 ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER IN GENEVA London, 30 November 1883 Dear Old Man, I can't tell you how glad I was to see your own handwriting again.
Nowhere had I been able to learn anything definite about how you were getting on, and am now glad to know that you are at least to some extent back on your feet again.
I, too, have been in bed for a good month now, in order to rid myself of a mild but most tiresome and prolonged ailment, and can only write very briefly since any position but the horizontal is forbidden me.
But no doubt I, too, will soon be up again and able to tackle the large accumulation of work.
As soon as I can resume the task of putting Marx's papers in order, I shall look out the things you want,126 but everything is still in the utmost disorder since I have to attend to everything myself.
Mme La-fargue has been living in Paris for a year or more now, and the young­ est sister" has furnished a couple of rooms nearby — nearby being half an hour's walk from here, and since it is I alone who must decide what is important and what is not among the vast mass of papers, etc.
, it is understandable that, considering her many literary activi­ ties, she should leave the sorting out to me.
I, too, hope that I shall see you again, my old comrade-in-arms, somewhere some day — who knows whether it might not be, as once before, at Durlach and Vöhrenbach in mid-campaign ' 27? How won­ derful that would be! And, after all, the present swindle can't go on for very much longer, provided Mr Bismarck does not again hold up or temporarily obstruct revolutionary developments by unleashing a general war, as is clearly his intention.
You will be getting from the post office a money order for £5 ster­ ling.

To-day it is eight weeks that I went to bed for good (or rather bad) and although I feel considerably bet­ ter, and keep in bed more for safety's sake than anything else, I am still far from able to use my legs as I ought to.
These poor 'lower ex­ tremities' to use the language of respectability, are woefully shrunk, and what is quite as bad, have left scarcely anything 'behind them'.
The worst is I am quite at ease only when laid flat on my back and writing has to be done in a constrained position and soon becomes a torture, so this must excuse my short and unfrequent letters.
Paul's article in Progress* I read with much pleasure, it hits more than one nail on the head.
Let us hope the 'Blé' will come out soon af­ ter the period of étrennes, h ' '4 and be followed soon by that novelc which I am most anxious to see.
Paul in Balzac's slippers it will be good! By the bye I have been reading scarcely anything but Balzac while laid up and enjoyed the grand old fellow thoroughly.
There is the history of France from 1815 to 1848, far more than in all the Vaulabelles, Gapefigues, Louis Blancs and tutti quanti.
d And what boldness! What a revolutionary dialectic in his poetical justice! But alas, we always drop back from the blooming field of romance into the dreary sick-bed of reality.
This bids fair to be a poor Christ­ mas! In the best of cases I may be allowed to spend it on the first floor, with order to go to my bedroom when one ought to begin to enjoy oneself! And no tipple, or at all events wine to be taken by the spoon­ ful, as medicine! Well it can't be helped.

His father has at last forked out the needful and set him up though with the sourest face and in the unpleasantest way possible.
Tussy has got neuralgia again, she will call here to-night, but only after this letter has gone.
The Jutas (he, she,e and Willa) arrived here last week, so Tussy will have plenty on her hands.

It should have arrived on Saturday, 29 December, but hasn't reached me yet.
A fortnight ago I was at last able to get up again, have improved steadily and hope to be fit for work in a week's time.
And a damned good thing too! I trust you were not too much infuriated by the number of amend­ ments I made to your ms.
' '8 As I once said to Kautsky, while we can­ not imitate Marx's style, our own ought to be such as not to be wholly out of keeping with Marx's.
Provided you don't lose sight of this alto­ gether, we may well produce a work that is presentable.
The note on American slavery b shall be done, and various others besides.
I shall also be able to include a fair amount in the preface.
0 How true the passage on slavery was is still evident today: capitalist production in the cotton states is not prospering — through not hav­ ing any coolies, Chinese or Indian, i.

slaves disguised as free labour; whereas in Cuba, Mauritius, Réunion, etc.

).
a I am sending you a copy in case you have not got one there.
It is simply a question of showing that the victorious proletariat must first reshape the old, bureaucratic, administratively centralised state machine before they can use it for their own purposes; whereas, since 1848, all bourgeois republicans, so long as they were in oppo­ sition, have heaped abuse on that machine but, no sooner in office, have taken it over intact and made use of it, partly against reaction but to an even greater extent against the proletariat.
That the Com­ mune's unconscious tendencies should, in The Civil War, have been credited to it as more or less deliberate plans was justifiable and per­ haps even necessary in the circumstances.
The Russians have very properly appended the passage from The Civil War to their transla­ tion of the Manifesto.
1*2, If there hadn't been such a great rush over getting it out, we could have done this and one or two other things.
Apropos.
You once spoke of Guesde's disreputable past, or some­ thing of the sort.
I know absolutely nothing about that.
Un­ doubtedly just a pack of lies on Malon's part, but I should be glad if you would enable me to clear the matter up.
I shall shortly be sending you one pound sterling from Schorlem-mer for his subscription, the balance for party purposes.
It's too late to take out a money order today.
At last things have got moving again in Russia.
The affair of the sledge and the Tsar is most suspect,'34 that of Sudeikin, on the other hand, crystal clear.
135 We should like to send Alexander11 a telegram wishing him 'a happy holiday'.
Has Tussy Marx sent you To-Day and the last numbers of Progress? If not I shall attend to this.
These two are completely divorced from the TRADES UNIONS movement and are in fact run by a very motley so­ ciety.
Bax is very honest but still somewhat green, Aveling is good but has little time in which to familiarise himself with economics, a sub­ ject utterly foreign to him.
Joynes is an unreliable chap (once a schoolmaster at the big doss house at Eton, travelled to Ireland with Henry George, was arrested with him and lost his post; is therefore looking around to see what's doing) and Hyndman, an ambitious party leader in partibus infidelium,c provisionally in search of a party a See present edition, Vol.

3 One's best course is to do justice to the aspirations without identifying oneself with the persons.
At all events, the publi­ cation of To-Day and the transformation of Progress into a socialist journal is of great significance at this particular juncture, now that the poor in the East End OF London are beginning to find their voice.
On top of that, all over the country we have chronic overproduction which now seems to be hastening on the crisis.
Circumstances are favourable, but whether the people who have taken the matter in hand are a match for those circumstances remains to be seen.
This time it's hardly likely to remain without a sequel, as have so many previous curtain-raisers.
Now basta.

'3 6 Not a soul knows about it apart from Schorlemmer, Lenchen and Tussy.
Many thanks for Frankel's address.
So far as purely theoretical matters are concerned, Deville's sum­ marya is the best that has yet appeared.
He has understood every­ thing aright, though his use of terminology has been very lax and this I have amended in the manuscript.
On the other hand the descriptive part is treated far too cursorily, with the result that some of it is to­ tally incomprehensible to anyone unfamiliar with the original.
Again; what would make for much greater ease of comprehension, particular­ ly in a popular account, namely the historical emergence of manu­ facture and large-scale industry as consecutive historical periods, is pushed much too much into the background.
(We aren't even told that 'factory legislation' does not operate at all in France, but only in England!) And, finally, he gives a full summary of the entire contents, including stuff which Marx had had to bring in if his account of scien­ tific developments was to be complete, but which is not necessary to an understanding of the theory of surplus value and its consequences (and this alone is what counts in the case of a popular summary).
Si­ milarly as regards the number of coins in circulation, etc.
b But then he also quotes verbatim from Marx's recapitulatory prop­ ositions, having given no more than an incomplete account of the as­ sumptions upon which they were based.
Consequently these proposi­ tions are frequently so distorted that in the course of my perusal I of­ ten found myself wanting to contest a proposition of Marx's, the limi­ tations of which are made plain in the original by what goes before; in Deville, however, they are accorded absolutely universal, and hence false, validity.
I can't change this without redoing the whole ms.
Now as to your translation of this,137 my position vis-à-vis Meissner compels me to adopt an entirely neutral position.
As soon as you write and tell me definitely that you will take the thing on, I propose, and I have already discussed this with Tussy who shares my view en­ tirely, to act as follows: I shall write to Meissner saying that someone intends to publish Deville's piece (which I shall send Meissner) in German and that I can see nothing in this that might damage the sales of Capital—boost them, more likely; I shall then add that I can-a G.

not stop it but that, if he intends to take preventive action, he might let me know and I shall then pass this on.
Seen in the abstract (i.
e.
disregarding Meissner), a new popular and short account [half the size of Deville) of the theory of surplus value is much needed, and Deville's work is, so far as theory goes, far better than the rest.
What should be dropped are 1) detailed refer­ ences to the individual chapters and subsections of Capital and, 2) any­ thing that is not necessary to an understanding of the theory of sur­ plus value.
This will involve rewriting the descriptive part from the beginning, and also considerable abridgement.
It would allay the worst of Meissner's misgivings, especially if we changed the title to e.
g.
Unpaid Labour and Its Transformation into Capital or something of the kind.
At worst the thing could be printed by Dietz and published in Switzerland, like Bebel's Frau.

'40 That German gravures pour enfants (Bilderbogen) d are gene­ rally good, is simple enough.
For more than 50 years they have been made chiefly at Düsseldorf, Munich, etc.
, and the designs are by young and often rising artists who do this work to earn a little money.
40 years ago however I recollect that French gravures ofthat sort came * See this volume, p.

-d pictures for children (picture-sheets) 79 to Germany, a good many by Adam the horse-and soldier-painter, and they were immensely superior to the German ones in chic and life.
If that has not been continued by French artists, they must have found no market.
As to toys, the German superiority is 1 ) cheapness, domestic indus­ try at starvation level (described lately by Dr Emanuel Sax, Die Haus­ industrie in Thüringen, very good) and 2) in that they are invented by peasants; townspeople never will be fit to invent for children, least of all French townspeople who hate their own children.
For furniture Paul gives the reason himself: the stupid fiscal policy of the French government.
Flowers similar: division of labour and low wages: who can com­ pete against the East End of London and Germany in cheapness? Gen­ erally speaking, bourgeois taste is getting so much out of taste that even the Germans may hope to be able to satisfy it.
And if any trade has become broken down enough to make 'cheap and nasty' its mar­ ket-rule, then you may be sure the Germans will step in and defeat all competition by starving their own workpeople.
And as this is the rule generally now for all trades, it explains the appearance of German goods in all trades and all markets.
I sent Lavroff last Thursday's Standard containing a report of an interview of their correspondent with a Petersburg police chief and in which Lavroffis blamed for all — the whole thing of course got up for the benefit of the philistine, but so stupidly that the effect aimed at is visible plainly in every word.

The thing was neither serious nor painful, but damned tedi­ ous and gênant* and I shall have to take great care of myself for some little while yet.
You will have received my letter about Miss Issleib written in bed in pencil.
Since I have heard nothing more, I can only suppose the matter has been dropped.
'4 ' — I dictated to Kautsky, who happened to be on the spot, '25 a letter to Liebknecht 39 which I hope he has re­ ceived and shown to you as requested.
From it you will have seen that I am under no illusions as to the American business, b nor was I in any way inclined to give you the impression that I regarded the thing as absolutely essential.
But I still maintain that, if it is to succeed, you two must go and no one else.
Whether you can do so, I have abso­ lutely no idea — you will know best.
But this much is certain — no amount of American money will make good the damage that will in­ fallibly be done if, after the manner of Fritzsche and Viereck, the emissaries again water down the party's viewpoint into a semblance a inconvenient -b See this volume, p.

47 And your pres­ ence would certainly be the best guarantee that nothing of the sort would happen.
I was delighted by the good news you sent me about the move­ ment's progress.
The government could not, in fact, have hit on any better means of keeping the movement going and intensifying it than by everywhere involving our chaps in these violent local struggles with the police, particularly when the police in Germany is made up of such worthless characters that our lads can turn the enemy's own weapons against him and take the offensive.
And if, on top ofthat, — as recently in Berlin — the police are confused by constantly chang­ ing instructions from above, so much the better.
Should there be any repetition of the attempt to bring 'the right to work' back into fashion,142 I would write something about it in the Sozialdemokrat.
I have discussed this with Kautsky a; but first I should like Geiser and Co.
to commit themselves a bit, to produce something tangible for us to go on, though Kautsky maintains that they won't.

, are the bane of the movement.
They know less than nothing and are, for that very rea­ son, reluctant to learn anything at all; their so-called socialism is npthing but philistine hot air.

Many thanks for your book Die Frau.
'38 I read it with great interest and there is much in it that is very good.
What you say about the dev­ elopment of industry in Germany is particularly good and clear.
This is a matter to which I, too, have again been turning my atten­ tion of late and I would, given the time, write something about it for the Sozialdemokrat.
Odd, how the philistines fail to realise that the 'plague of vagabonds' they so lament is, in the present state of agri­ culture and handicrafts in Germany, the inescapable consequence of the rise of large-scale industry, or that, because Germany is always the last to arrive on the scene, the development of this selfsame large-scale industry can only take place there under the constant pressure of poor business conditions.
For the Germans are only able to com-a See this volume, p.

-b William I pete by paying lower wages, depressed to starvation level, and by reg­ ularly exploiting to the utmost the cottage industry that forms the background to manufacturing industry.
The transformation of han­ dicrafts into cottage industry and the gradual transformation of cot­ tage industry, in so far as this pays, into manufacturing and machine­ ry— such is the present trend in Germany.
So far, the only large-scale industry proper we have is iron; in the textile industry — thanks to starvation wages and the fact that weavers possess potato plots — the hand-loom still prevails.
In this country, too, industry has taken on a different character.
The ten-year cycle would seem to have been disrupted since 1870, when American and German competition began to destroy England's monopoly of the world market.
Since 1868 business has been slack in the main branches, while production has been gradually increasing; and now, here and in America, we appear to be on the eve of another crisis which has not, in England, been preceded by a period of prosper­ ity.
That is the secret behind the sudden emergence of the socialist movement over here — sudden, although it has been slowly maturing for the past 3 years.
Organised labour — TRADE UNIONS — has, as yet, no sort of connection with it; the movement proceeds under 'educated' elements of bourgeois origin, some of whom seek to make contact with the masses and occasionally succeed in so doing.
Morally and in­ tellectually, these elements vary considerably and it will be some time before they sort themselves out and the position becomes clear.
But the thing is hardly likely to fizzle out again altogether.
Henry George and his nationalisation of land 143 may well play a meteoric role be­ cause this issue is of traditional significance over here — of real signifi­ cance, too, owing to the vast dimensions of the big estates.
But in the long run this by itself must cease to have any pull in what is the world's leading industrial country.
Besides, George is a bourgeois born and bred, and his plan of meeting all state expenditure out of rent is merely a second edition of the Ricardian school's plan, i.
e.
purely bourgeois.
If you wish to study a model of state socialism, then take a look at Java.
There the Dutch government has, on the basis of the old, com­ munistic village communities, organised production as a whole along such nicely socialist lines, and so neatly assumed control of the sale of all produce that, apart from some 100 million marks for army and ci­ vil service pay, there remains each year a clear profit of some 70 mil-lion marks for payment of interest to the luckless creditors of the Dutch state.
a Bismarck is a mere child by comparison! One way or another, we shall have a Russian constitution in the course of this year, and then the fun will begin.

15 My inquiry today concerns the following: Various things among Marx's papers will be suitable for the party archives 144; just now I am in process of sorting his books, etc.
, and am glad to be again in a condition to do so.
Besides these, however, there is a good deal of superfluous stuff which would be very useful to an editorial library for the party organc and is superfluous here, as we have in duplo.
d Firstly dictionaries: 1) the big French-German Mozin-Peschier, 5 volumes quarto, binding very dilapidated, 2) the old Italian Jagemann, also very good, 3) Spanish, Dutch, Danish, perhaps even more.
I can't yet be sure whether Tussy might not want to keep one thing or another; if not shall I send them to Zurich with the remainder? Besides these, one thing or another will continue to turn up and could be offered to you, once I know that you are in­ terested.
Further, as regards Justice.
This paper has suddenly been launched upon the world by Hyndman with insufficient financial and absolute­ ly no literary preparation.

Hyndman, however, cannot wait and will probably burn his fingers yet again.

It is apparent from the complete dearth of ideas in the first two numbers that the chaps are at their wits' end and are looking to new contributors for further material.
In short it has mis­ fired and only an unexpectedly favourable turn of events can put it on its feet.
In case Mr von der Mark or anyone else should again speak of our 'concessions' to the anarchists, 130 the following passages prove that we had proclaimed the cessation [Aufhören] of the state before the anarchists even existed: Misere de la philosophie, page 177: 'La classe laborieuse substituera, dans son développement, à l'ancienne société civile une association qui excluera les classes et leur antagonisme, et il • n'y aura plus de pouvoir politique proprement dit, puisque le pouvoir politique est précisément le résumé officiel de V antagonisme dans la société civile.

W.
My dear Lavrov, Some three weeks ago I sent you a Standard containing an article I thought might be of interest to youc; I hope it reached you safely.
a Frederick Engels and Eleanor Marx -b In the original the following words are de­ leted: 'in so far as we are empowered to give such permission'.
-c See this volume, p.
79.
I am at present engaged — as my health at long last permits — in sorting out the books, etc.
, left by Marx.
Amongst other things they comprise, thanks to the kindness of Danielson, an entire library of Russian books, with some very important material on present social conditions in Russia; it contains almost everything that has been brought out on the subject.
At my age, and overburdened as I am with work, it would be impossible for me to resume a novo2' the thorough-going survey of Russia so unfortunately interrupted by the death of our friend.
57 So it seemed to me, and Tussy is of the same opin­ ion, that it was our duty to place these books at your disposal.
In your capacity as the acknowledged representative of the revolution­ ary Russian emigration and as an old friend of the deceased, you have clearly more right than anyone else to the collection of books so devot­ edly provided by friends, both yours and ours, in Russia — either for your personal use or to form the nucleus of a library for the revolu­ tionary Russian emigration.
If you accept, I could send them either to your own address or to any other you might indicate this Febru­ ary.
The only books I should keep here would be those from which Marx had made extracts, along with one or two others which I might need for the second volume of Capital'1; the remainder when all de­ ductions have been made, would amount to a hundred or so volumes at the outside.
148 As for the second volume, I am at last beginning to see daylight.
For the most important parts — i.
e.
the beginning and the end of the sec­ ond book, Circulation of Capital,— we have a version dating from 1875 and later.
To this nothing needs to be added save quotations in accordance with the indications supplied.
For the middle section there are no fewer than four versions dating from before 1870, and therein lies the only difficulty.
'7 The third volume, Capitalist Produc­ tion as a Whole, exists in two versions dating from before 1869; subse­ quent to that there is nothing but a few notes and a notebook full of equations, the purpose of which is to arrive at the many reasons why the Mehrwertsrate becomes the Prqfitrate.
b149 But the extracts from books both on Russia and on the United States80 contain a vast amount of material and copious notes on land rent, while others relate to money capital, to credit and to paper money as an instrument of credit, etc.
As yet I do not know what use I shall be able to make of this for the third book; it might perhaps be better to combine them in a separate a anew -b the rate of surplus value becomes the rate of profit 89 publication, and I shall certainly do so if the difficulty of incorporat­ ing them into Capital proves too great.
My chief concern is that the book should come out as soon as possible, and also and above all that the book I publish should be unmistakably a work by Marx.
Any day now we should receive copies of the 3rd edition of Volume I, a and one will be sent off to you as soon as they arrive.
The Russian publications from Geneva — the Manifesto, etc.
78 — gave me much pleasure.
I have just had a letter from two Poles, Krzywicki and Sosnowski, requesting ourb consent to a Polish translation of Capital which, of course, we gave.
0 Sosnowski is in Paris; do you, by any chance, know these citizens? 150 Yours ever, F.

A copy has been ordered for Meissner in Paris; by the time it arrives, your answer may have got here as well.

I shall be glad to look over the theoretical part, although I can hardly suppose it is necessary.
There's no point in my looking over the descriptive part, as you won't have any difficulty in avoiding Deville's mistakes.
Of these the chief is his presenting as absolute, Marxian propositions which, in Marx, hold good only with qualifica­ tions (omitted by Deville) and which therefore appear false.
All other matters in a day or two.

^ •• , r • r • non Published in English for the lirst time 53 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN 61 IN ZURICH London, 5 February 1884 Dear Bernstein, You can set your mind at rest about one thing: I could wish for no better translator than you yourself.
' '8 In attempting, in the first sheet, to give an accurate and precise rendering of the sense, you have paid rather too little attention to the syntax, voilà tout.
" Moreover I wanted to incorporate Marx's idiosyncratic syntax which is unfami­ liar to you; hence the many emendations.
If, having once put the sense into German, you go through the ms.
again with an eye to readable syntax, at the same time bearing in mind that you should wherever possible avoid the wearisome syntax of the schoolroom which always puts the verb of the subordinate clause right at the end — and which was drummed into all of us—, you will have little difficulty and be perfectly capable of putting everything right yourself.
that's all 91 You would do best to send me the ms.
by sections, each of them ± a a whole, 1, l'/2 or 2 printed sheets at a time.
In which case I shall also supply the notes for it straight away.
I should also like to see the proofs; many things look quite different in print.
Please send me the article on Proudhon in the old Social-Demokrat.
XiX I had overlooked it; the whole thing might have to go into the preface.
You will get it back, of course.
As regards von der Mark and the Volkszeitung, I am entirely of your opinion.
130 When Marx died, Schewitschyà/^«^ my telegram to Sorge and printed it as though it had been sent to the Volkszeitung.
I protested.
b He glossed over the falsification with the lie that the first word had been illegible — though he copied it correctlyl while the other he had 'considered necessary in the interests of the paper'! More­ over he thought it 'petty' of me to have drawn his attention to it.
Petty it certainly was not, magnanimous rather, considering the way those gentlemen took advantage of Marx's death to draw attention to themselves and proclaim their semi-alliance with Most.
However, Schewitsch is the last Russian socialist aristocrat; such men must al­ ways 'go further than anyone else' and are accustomed to use the world at large as a means to serve their own ends.
The article on to­ lerance was downright silly.
'5 2 Russians have set about one another con amore,c as have the Irish.
I don't know whether you get the Travailleur, etc.
; I receive a few copies from time to time and shall send them to you.
Also two Sozial-demokrats with scorings by Marx which might interest you.
I shall keep Schorlemmer's pound here then; will you debit me with this, in return credit Schorlemmer with his annual subscription, and pay the balance (inserting an announcement to this effect in the Sozialdemokrat) into the election fund.
d Similarly, will you debit me with Tussy's and my subscriptions, supposing that she doesn't decide to send you To-Day in exchange.
Finally, will you alter Tussy's ad­ dress and send items to Miss Marx, 32 Great Coram St.

Let me know roughly what it should be about so that it fits into your scheme.
153 Meissner, then, will doubtless still have copies of the 18th Brumaire" 1; his failure to push it is doubtless attributable to timidity.
Marx sold him the entire edition, so there is nothing we can do.
b Tussy has taken the best of the dictionaries — French and Ita­ lian — but there are still plenty left and I have made certain that you get one particularly nice item — the editorial copy of the Neue Rheini­ sche Leitung.
The parcel will go off in the course of this month.
I don't know of any poems — König Dampf, perhaps, from my Con­ dition of the Working-Class 0? A search is being made here for the En­ glish original, but it seems to have fallen into oblivion, like the Serbian of Goethe's lament of Hassan Aga's noble wife, only still more so, since the latter does after all still exist in black and white.

And, even so, I shan't be able to set about things seri­ ously before the middle of March.
It will take me up till then to get all the books, papers, periodicals, etc.
, in order, and I can't work on them for more than a few hours a day without becoming overtired.
It weighs on me all the more heavily for the knowledge that there is not another living soul who can decipher that writing and those abbrevia­ tions of words and style.
As to publication by instalments,155 that will depend to some extent upon the editor and upon legislation in Ger­ many; hitherto I have not thought such a method particularly useful for a book of this kind.
I shall try and do what AonaTHHta wants in re­ gard to the proofs.
But then Btpa 3acyAmn>b wrote to me a couple of months ago asking whether I would allow her to do the translation.
I told her that I regarded AonaTHirb as having first refusal and that it was still too soon to talk about the matter.
0 What could be discussed at once, however, would be the possibility of publishing the transla­ tion in Russia.
Do you think that might be done? The 2nd book is pure­ ly scientific, dealing solely with questions as from bourgeois to bour­ geois, but the 3rd will contain passages which make me doubt the very possibility of their being published in Germany under the Anti-Socialist Law.
37 The same difficulty applies to the publication of Marx's complete works, and that is only one of the many difficulties to be overcome.
I have some 60 sheets (each of 16 printed pages) of old manuscripts by Marx and myself dating from between 1845 and 1848.
Of this ma­ terial only extracts could be published, but I shan't be able to get down to it until I have finished with the manuscript of the 2nd volume of Capital.
So all we can do is wait.
The article you speak of, '5 6 and which we no longer have here, will amount to between 3 and 5 printed sheets; it is a detailed summary of the political development of France from 24 February 1848 up till 1851.
It is summed up in the 18th Brumaired but all the same it is worth translating.
I myself am on the lookout for a complete set of the Neue Rheinische ^eitung Revue,' only 2/5ths of which are in my posses­ sion.

He is a leading man amongst the German work­ men in Paris who you recollect had a few years ago been coaxed round by Malon's soft sawder, and were further pushed in that direc­ tion by some stupid blunders of the Citoyen.
They are now furious anti-Broussists since the 'international Conference' ' 15; but still thick with Adhémar Leclère and his Cercle international.
163 I have asked Paul several times to get into connection with the Paris Germans.
They are not worth much, but they influence the German party as to Pa­ risian affairs.
Since the Socialist Law,37 these societies abroad have na­ turally recovered an influence much above their merits, as they are the only bodies remaining in possession of a public organisation.
It will be difficult for the Sozialdemokrat to go direct against them in its judgment of Parisian internal quarrels.

All I can say is that I could, in certain circumstances and provided they were worth the trouble, enter into a cartel, but never form an/ alliance, with people who have not comlpetely and unre­ servedly adopted the revolutionary communist standpoint.
Besides my time is completely taken up with work that it is absolutely imperative I Should do, and my international correspondence is, in any case, al­ ready extensive enough.
Clemenceau would certainly have to be in­ duced to go considerably further before we could ally ourselves with him; whether, as the immediate ministerial candidate of the extreme Left, he would wish to be on more than ordinarily 'good terms' with us would seem to be debatable.
One can remain thus on good terms with socialists of the most diverse shades of opinion until a difference of principle or tactics crops up, whereupon sympathy turns into anti­ pathy.
Accordingly, it is now for you to decide whether I am a man who would suit your book.

W.
Dear Old Man, There is no reason for you to worry about my health; the thing was a long drawn-out but not at all dangerous, and is steadily abating.
I have sent Laura a copy of the note with the New Year's greetings.
I have also taken out a money order for five pounds to enable you, old chap, to cosset yourself and your wife a bit.
I hope that the com­ paratively mild winter and the better time of year now approaching will put you both on your feet again.
I have found a few things that emanated from you but cannot yet say whether there are any more.
There's a whole big hamper full of letters, etc.
, to be looked through.
As soon as I've sorted it out, I shall send you everything that turns up.
126 Now, as regards your plan, '6 7 it is the circumstances presently pre­ vailing in Germany that are the first consideration.
From time to time I get information on the subject direct from Germany and, according to this, the despotism of the police is unrestrained and the govern­ ment is determined to put a stop to any public agitation by our party, no matter what the pretext for that agitation or under what name it is conducted.
The fact that Social Democrats are at the back of it is enough for any meeting to be dispersed, any attempt to have a say in the press smothered and any participant expelled from a locality sub­ ject to the state of emergency.
67 The experience of the past six years cannot leave us in any doubt as to that.
Now I am of the view that the appropriateness, timing and object of a renewed attempt at mass agitation are things we who live abroad are utterly incapable of deciding, and that this must be left entirely to those in Germany who have to endure the pressure there and who know best what is possible and what is impossible.
So if you approach 57.
Engels to Becker.
14 February 1884 99 Bebel or Liebknecht, and they deliberate the matter there, it would, in my view, be for them to decide the pros and cons, and for us to abide by their decision.
Come to that, things aren't going too badly in Germany where agi­ tation is concerned, although the bourgeois papers suppress most of it and only sometimes and despite themselves emit an anxious moan about the rapidity with which the party is gaining ground instead of losing it.
The police have opened up for our men a quite splendid field — the omnipresent and unremitting struggle with the police themselves.
It is being conducted everywhere and continuously with great success and, better still, with great humour.
The police are de­ feated and — ridiculed into the bargain.
And, in the circumstances, I consider this struggle to be more useful than any other.
Above all, it keeps contempt for the enemy alive in our lads' minds.
No worse troops could be sent into action than those of the German police; even when they have the upper hand they suffer moral defeat, and our lads' confidence in victory grows from day to day.
The effect of this struggle will be such that, as soon as the pressure at last lets up (and that will happen on the day things get cracking in Russia) we shall not be numbered in our hundreds of thousands but in our millions.
Among the so-called leaders there may be plenty of rotten stuff, but in our masses I have unmitigated faith, and what they lack in revolu­ tionary tradition, they will increasingly be taught by their guerilla war with the police.
And, say what you will, we have never yet seen a proletariat learn in so short a time to act collectively and march shoulder to shoulder.
Hence, although nothing may appear on the surface, we can, I think, confidently look to the day when the alarm is sounded.
Then just watch them stand~to+ Fraternal greetings from your old friend F.

I shall revert to this at the appropriate mo­ ment.
168 As to the German edition, you will be aware that over there we are under threat from absolute despotism and that anything is liable to be suppressed.
Marx never allowed himself to be inhibited by the legisla­ tion of the day; he always spoke his mind and it would be truly mira­ culous if the 2nd volume did not contain enough confiscable and sup­ pressive material to fall foul of the law of 1878.
37 But that is a risk we must run and, as for myself, I certainly have no intention of watering anything down.
When TepMaHi) Aona-raH-B a was here b he told me that Nikolai Da-nielson wanted me to return him a book entitled Tpydu KoMUCciu djin u3CJihdoeamH XJIÜÖHOÜ npoMuiumuHocmu es Pocciu.

Might that be the book he is referring to? If so I shall return it to 27 MoHKa,e St Petersburg as soon as I have your confirmation.

XXVII, Moscow, 1935 Translated from the French Published in English for the first time 59 ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY 88 IN ZURICH London, 16 February 1884 Dear Kautsky, I happen to have an hour or two to spare today, hence my prompt reply.
Not only Deville's historical section, but also his descriptive one (working day, cooperation, manufacturing, large-scale industry, etc.
) will require revision, of which you may assure yourself by going through a couple of chapters.
All I shall do for the present, so far as Meissner is concerned, is to send him the French text and inform him that revision is under way ' 3 ' and that I shall let him have further de­ tails in due course.
The Poverty is also coming out in a new French edition in Paris.
I am writing a preface to it169; in the one to the German edition, I shall dispose of the myth of Rodbertus.
a This stemmed from Rudolf Meyer '7 ° and has been so widely hawked around in Germany, this country and even America, that the thing has got to be scotched once and for all.
I shall show, 1) that in 1850 we had had no opportunity of learning anything whatsoever from Mr Rodbertus, 2) that he was a,F.
Engels, 'Marx and Rodbertus'.
quite unknown to us, 3) that his great discoveries had already been commonplaces in 1848, 4) that the remedies he specifies for use in so­ cialist therapy had already been criticised in the Poverty, prior to Rod-bertus' discovery of them.
So as you see, there's plenty left for you to do; but the above matters can only be attended to, because experienced, by me, while I am also the only person to possess the necessary material from the years 1840-50.
Rodbertus' theory of rent is nonsense; the first 1861-63 manuscript of Capital contains a detailed and somewhat ironical critique of it by Marx, in a very long section, Theories of Surplus Value, which I shall probably publish at the end of the 2nd volume or as a 3rd volume.
'7 ' What I require for my preface, however, is Rodbertus' Offener Brief an das Comité des Deutschen Arbeitervereins, Leipzig, 1863.
Could you or Ede get hold of the thing and let me have it for a few days? As soon as I have made extracts, you shall have it back.
I have not yet received the Proudhon article from the old Social-Demokrat '51 promised me by Ede — might arrive this evening.
I shall probably translate it for the French edition.
If Ede were suddenly to turn up here it would please me no end; I could join him in a drink, being now once again able to indulge in a very modest way.
Let us now return to your last letter but one.
'7 2 Dietz asked for the Condition of the Working-Class long ago, and I virtually promised he should have it as soon as I had found out how I stood with Wigand, its former publisher.
For the past 15 years Liebknecht has been promis­ ing to ascertain this through Freytag (i.
e.
what my legal position is vis-à-vis Wigand), and still I'm in the dark.
a At all events, Dietz has first refusal, and ultimately I shall myself take steps to find out what I am entitled to do.
It would be a good thing if someone were to take the trouble to throw light on the proliferation of state socialism, drawing for the purpose on an exceedingly flourishing example of the practice in Java.

It's a most interesting case, and conclusions as to its practical application are easy to draw.
It also shows how there, as in India and Russia today, primitive com­ munism (provided no modern communist element comes to stir it up) supplies the best and also the broadest basis for exploitation and des­ potism, and survives in the midst of modern society as an anachro­ nism (to be eliminated or, one might almost say, turned back on its course) no less glaring than the Mark communities of the original cantons.
'7 3 There is a definitive book — as definitive as Darwin's was in the case of biology — on the primitive state of society; once again, of course, Marx was the one to discover it.
It is Morgan's Ancient Society, 1877.
Marx mentioned it, but my head was full of other things at the time and he never referred to it again which was, no doubt, agreeable to him, wishing as he did to introduce the book to the Germans him­ self 11*; I can see this from his very exhaustive extracts.
Within the lim­ its set by his subject, Morgan rediscovers for himself Marx's mate­ rialist view of history, and concludes with what are, for modern so­ ciety, downright communist postulates.
The Roman and Greek gens is, for the first time, fully elucidated in the light of that of savages, in particular the American Indians, thus providing a firm basis for the history of primitive times.
If I had the time to spare, I would work up the material, together with Marx's notes, for the feuilleton of the Sozialdemokrat or for the Neue £eit, but it's out of the question.
All the impostures — endogamy, exogamy and whatever else the balderdash is called — of Tylor, Lubbock and Co.
have been demolished once and for all.
' 7 5 These gentry are doing all they can to suppress the book in this country; it is printed in America and I ordered it 5 weeks since but cannot get hold of it, although the name of a London firm figures as co-publisher on the title-page! Kindest regards.
Yours, F.

We have got the old 'Speicher'* at last cleared out, found a whole lot of things that have to be kept, but about half a ton of old newspapers that it is impossible to sort.
I think next week we can begin to clear out and the week after sell up the remainder for what it will fetch.
I was afraid at one time I should have to give it up again, but fortunately I am getting better every day, I can walk again for half an hour as fast as ever and with Nim's help get through two bottles of Pilsener and a fair allowance of claret every 24 hours.
Amongst the manuscripts there is the first version of the Kapital (1861-63) and there I find several hundred pages: Theorien über den Mehrwert '7 ' partly worked up into the text of the later versions, ' 7 6 but there will be quite enough left to swell the 2nd volume into a 2nd and a 3rd.
Bernstein is sending me an article of Mohr's on Proudhon, published in the Berlin Social-Demokrat of 1865.
Very likely the whole of it will have to be translated for the French edition of the Misère.
' 65 By the bye Bernstein will be in Lyons to-morrow and may come to Paris while once on the road, and even extend his trip to London.
If he does come to Paris, pray engage him to come here too, I want to see him about a good many things; he knows he finds a bed here ready to receive him and if he is a little short of cash, that should not stop him, we can arrange about that.
177 Paul tells me I can take my time about the preface to the Misère '69 but I don't believe in that sort ofthing, I have too much experience of publishers.
I want to know by what time Oriol will require it, though I won't undertake that I shall deliver it to the day or even the week; but I ought to have some idea.
The house in Maitland Park has to be a 'storehouse' delivered up on the 25th March, and I have plenty of other things to do besides; I must be able to arrange my plans beforehand to some extent at least.
What Paul thinks is an article of Mohr's on Proudhon's la propriété c'est le vol* is in the Heilige Familie which I have got.
b I cannot much share Paul's enthusiasm about the London Justice, I find the paper awfully dull.
But what can you expect of a set of peo­ ple who take in hand the task of instructing the world about matters of which they themselves are ignorant? There is not a single burning question which they know how to tackle; Hyndman combines inter­ nationalist phraseology and jingo aspirations, Joynes is a muddled ig­ noramus (I saw him a fortnight ago), Morris is all very well as far as he goes, but it is not far, poor Bax gets himself fast in German philos­ ophy of a rather antiquated character—all that might do for a monthly where they have time to get themselves into harness, but for a weekly, with all sorts of questions d'actualité to be tackled, it is blamable.
Anyhow the new 'respectable' Socialist stir here does go on very nicely, the thing is becoming fashionable, but the working classes do not respond yet.
Upon that everything depends.
And this is why it was so stupid to hurry on the bringing out of Justice.
Articles like these will never stir up the masses.
Six months' intercourse with working people would have prepared a public and taught the writers how to write for it.
But what's the use of grumbling? Les petits grands hommes veulent absolument faire leur petit bonhomme de chemin!" I hope the children0 are better.
Nim is rather anxious about them.
Do please let us know how they are going on.
Best love from Nim and from Your affectionate F.

As to what is to be done in case anything happens to Longuet, well, that will have to be considered if that event should occur; I do not see what much should be gained if we 'speculated' on that now — I mean speculating in the philosophical sense — at any rate I do not see either what we can do under present circumstances with such a pa­ ternal father as Longuet, but if you do, I shall be most happy to hear from you on the subject.

Please, you and Paul, to turn my translation into proper French and return it along with the original which belongs to the Partei-Archiv 144 at Zurich.
There will only a few more words be required.
But what will the French public say to the rather unceremonious manner in which Mohr speaks of them? And will it be wise to have this true and impartial judgment at the risk that the Brousses say: voilà le Prussien a? Anyhow, I should be very loth to soften the article down to suit le gout parisien b but it is worth considering.
There is no denying that the bas empire" has been there for 18 years.
Paul's bon dieu d is charming, so is the introduction to his confér­ ence.
'7 9 The exposé too is quite taking for his public and I am not as­ tonished at his success.
But he might now and then give them a new il­ lustration from the Kapital besides the old quotation of Liebig about the size of recruits e; and not treat 1) la concurrence and 2) l'offre et la demande? which is but la concurrence over again.
If I am strict with him, it's because I see it does him good and he improves considerably by hammering a bit now and then; his last performances certainly show great progress, and if he would only be a little more attentive to certain theoretical points (mostly of detail) he would be a great light in Paris, ville-lumière s as it is.
Now I must conclude.
Nim has come back and we must make up book-packets for Russia and America, in time for registering.

Malon did indeed quit the Peace Congress 180 in com­ pany with Bakunin and 15 others, and he was a co-founder of the sec­ ret Alliance.
20 The document of March 1870 has actually been in my possession '8 ' ; what the lies are that Malon has recently been concocting about the International are of no interest to me; I am un­ likely so much as to look at them.
In my view the fact that he is self-taught does not give him the right to falsify history.
If he is fit to play a leading role among the French, I am sorry for the French prole­ tariat.
As regards your propagation of international relations,3 1 ) the aims are so vague that I really cannot give up any time on the strength of your general prospects; 2) virtually all the people you mention are unknown to me (the only one I know at all well is precisely the one you fail to name).
But one cannot be active in the international movement for 40 years without having everywhere old friends and allies to whom one is poli­ tically and morally committed.
I should therefore first have to obtain information from them about many of your people and about the at­ titude of one side to the other.
I cannot very well do that, however, without giving some inkling of your scheme; 3) but I cannot possibly embark on an alliance without having the least idea of where and into what further associations it will lead me.

W.
Dear Citizen, For me, as also for Marx's daughters, it will be a great day when the Russian translation of The Poverty of Philosophy appears.
185 I need hardly say that I shall be glad to place at your disposal any material that might be useful to you.
This is what I propose to do.
In addition to the German translation, a new French edition is at present being printed in Paris.
165 For these two editions I am prepar­ ing a few explanatory notes, the text of which I shall send you.
For the preface there is in existence an article by Marx on Proud-hon in the Berlin Social-Demokrat (1865), which contains virtually all that is necessary.
It will be printed at the beginning of the two new French and German editions.
The only copy in existence is in our party archives at Zurich 144; if a second one doesn't turn up amongst my own or Marx's papers (I shall know about this in a few weeks), you will easily be able to get hold of a copy of it through Bernstein.
For the German edition I shall have to do a separate prefacea re­ butting the absurd contention by reactionary socialists 186 that in Ca­ pital Marx plagiarised Rodbertus, and proving that, on the con­ trary, Marx had produced his critique of Rodbertus in the Poverty be­ fore Rodbertus wrote his Social Letters.
'8 ' To my mind this is of no interest to a Russian public as yet unpenetrated by our pseudo-socialists.
But you are the best judge; the thing is at your disposal should you think it suitable.
What you tell me about the increase in the study of books on social­ ist theory in Russia gives me much pleasure.
The theoretical and crit­ ical spirit, which has virtually disappeared from our German schools, would indeed appear to have taken refuge in Russia.
You ask me to suggest some books for translation.
But you have already translated, or promised to translate, almost all of Marx's works and you have taken the best of mine.
The remainder of our German books are ei-a F.

ther weak on theory or concerned with matters more or less restricted to Germany.
The French have latterly produced some pretty good stuff, but this is still in its infancy.
Deville's summary of Capital81 is good as regards the theoretical part, but the descriptive part was done in too great haste and is virtually unintelligible to anyone not familiar with the original; moreover it is too long for a summary.
However I believe something worthwhile might be made of it if it were rewritten, and a summary of Capital would always be of use in a country where the book itself can only be obtained with difficulty.
It is true that, when I spoke of the situation in Russia," I was also thinking, inter alia, specifically of her finances — but not exclusively.
For a government at bay, like the one in Petersburg, and a captive Tsar, like the hermit of Gatchina,b the situation cannot continue without becoming ever more tense.
188 Nobility and peasantry both ruined, the army ruffled in its chauvinism and shocked by the daily spectacle of a rocy4api>.
c who hides himself away; the necessity for an ex­ ternal war as a safety-valve for 'evil passions' and for general discon­ tent— at the same time the impossibility of embarking upon one for lack of money and of favourable political conjunctures; a powerful national intelligentsia impatient to break the fetters that bind it and^ on top of all this, a total absence of money and an authority with the knives of the AT>flTeAHd at its throat189 —it seems to me that with every month the situation must become more impossible and that, were a bold and constitutionally minded grand duke to turn up, Rus­ sian 'society' itself must see that a palace coup would be the best way out of this impasse.
Will Bismarck and Bleichröder now come to the rescue of their new friends? ' 82 I doubt it.
Rather, I wonder which of the two contracting parties will be cheated by the other.
Enclosed a manuscript of Marx's (copy) for you to use as you think fit.

I trust that you and your wife will also gradually get over the after-effects of your far more serious illness and then gradually resume your old way of life.
Since I am not yet completely mobile and my excursions are limit­ ed to the immediate neighbourhood, and not having anyone to send out on errands, I carried out your commission in rather a different way.
Your copy of Capital, 3rd edition,13 and likewise one of Deville's Le Capital, were despatched to you in 2 parcels per BOOK POST; I shall send the photographs in the same manner, having now found out how to pack them.
No doubt you will be able to obtain the other 2 copies of Capital easily enough over there.
a Socialism: Utopian and Scientific -b the third German edition of Volume I of Capital I have taken out a year's subscription to To-Day for you and you will, no doubt, be getting it regularly.
The chaps are very well-intentioned but damnably ignorant; which may be all right for To-Day, but now the DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION "is bringing out a weekly journal, Justice, which is conspicuous for the exceeding boredom of its invariably repetitive contents and for its total inability to get hold of the right end of the stick even when dealing with a question of the day.
I shall send you a couple of issues; it's not worth taking.
All in all, the DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION cannot simply be taken on trust; it har­ bours all manner of dubious elements.
Hyndman, who sets himself up as a party leader in partibus infidelium, 2' is a pretty unscrupulous career­ ist, and only a few years ago stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate for Parliament192; moreover, he treated Marx very shab­ bily.
'00 I will have nothing whatever to do with the DEMOCRATIC FEDE­ RATION, a handy excuse being want of time, and am on closer terms only with To-Day, more notably Bax.
The latter is a very good chap, save only that he is most unseasonably swotting up on Kant.
If you have no objection, I shall publish in To-Day an English version of the letter Marx wrote to you about Henry George.
31 Then you will be able to make further use of it over there.
I shall hardly have time to enter into a debate with Stiebeling.
193 Such little tin gods can safely be left to their own devices.
In any case, it will be years before anything can be done to inhibit sectarianism in America.
Thus the great Most will, no doubt, eventually end up as Karl Heinzen II.
I get the Wochen-Volkszeitung,h but there's not much in it.
What the position is as regards Bebel's, Liebknecht's or anyone else's going to America, I don't know.
29 When they asked me, I told the chaps that it probably wouldn't do to go tapping America for election funds every third year.
In Germany, by the way, the position is very good.
Our lads are conducting themselves really splendidly.
Everywhere the Anti-Socialist Law37 is involving them in local struggles with the police, to the accompaniment of all manner of jokes and dirty tricks, struggles which usually turn out in our favour and are a source of the best propaganda in the world.
Every now and again one or other of the bourgeois papers vents a sigh about the enormous progress made by our people, and they all of them dread the coming elections.
194 A fortnight ago one of my nephews from a It means literally: in parts inhabited by unbelievers; here: nominally.

'In Germany,' I told him, 'we have got to the stage when we can sit with our hands in our laps and let our opponents do the work for us.
No matter whether you repeal, renew, tighten up or moderate the Anti-Socialist Law, what­ ever you do plays into our hands.
' 'Yes,' said he, 'it is remarkable how circumstances are working for you.
' 'To be sure they are,' I said, 'but they wouldn't be if we hadn't diagnosed them aright forty years ago, and acted accordingly.
' No reply.
In France, too, things have been going better since Lafargue, Guesde and Dormoy were released from prison.
9 They are very ac­ tive, spend much time in the provinces where, luckily, their chief strength lies, possess little news-sheets in Rheims and St Pierre-les-Calais,a and will be holding a congress at Roubaix in a month's time.
195 Every Sunday, what is more, they give a very well-attended lecture in Paris, when Lafargue speaks on the materialist view of his­ tory, and Deville on Capital.
17 9 I shall write and ask them to send you the things, all of which are printed.
It's fortunate that they haven't got a daily in Paris just now, since it's much too early for that.
A new edition of The Poverty of Philosophy is coming out in Paris.
165 Likewise a German one in Zurich and a Russian in Geneva.
I don't believe I have yet sent you a copy of my Entwicklung^ never having received more than one or two myself.
(The oafs!) Now the thing has come out in a 3rd edition, as well as in French, Italian, Russian and Polish.
Aveling wishes to translate it into English.
0 He, too, is an ad­ mirable young man, but he has TOO MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE and is cur­ rently engaged in time-consuming strife with his former friend Brad-laugh; the socialist movement here is cutting the ground from under the latter's feet — and with it his livelihood.
That means he must fight for it, but it isn't easy for that narrow-minded and rascally fellow.
So far, all is well with Tussy who generally comes here on Sundays.
Lenchen is, as you know, keeping house for me.
In a fortnight's time I shall be able to settle down in real earnest to Volume II of Capi­ tal— another huge task, but I look forward to it.

We have at last wound things up to­ day at Maitland Park 159 and handed back the old house to its own­ er.
a I, on the other hand, am still in the throes of sorting out the books and papers nor, until this has been done, shall I be able to embark on any regular work.
The demonstration of the 16th ' " caused two people to make fools of themselves — Hyndman and Frohme.
Hyndman, without having actually given his assent, had been proposed as speaker—by, it is said, Rackow.
Not being convinced of success, he declared in Justice that 'a working man' must speak and that as for him, he would merely listen.
b The same issue of Justice con­ tained an extremely impertinent notice on the last number of To-Day— amounting to a veiled declaration of war.
20° Hyndman next proceeded to intrigue against the despatch of delegates to the Roubaix congress, 195 alleging that those responsible were in a minority and that one ought not to go meddling in internal French dis­ putes.

-c 18 March 119 trusty followers took the floor against him, nor could he confess the real motives for his intervention; it was enthusiastically resolved to participate in both demonstration and congress, and Hyndman, who would now have gladly spoken in Highgate, had cut off his own line of retreat, the invitation to speak having passed to Aveling and been gladly accepted.
That's what invariably befalls these clever-clever cliquists — they are hoist with their own petard.
Frohme apparently spoke very well in Highgate and, by contrast, quite atrociously at the Society.
162 I am sending you the Deutsche Londoner Reifung in which the philistine reporter naively betrays his de­ light at the way Frohme had, with his atrocious platitudes, voiced his inmost thoughts for him.
a This, apparently, was altogether too much of a good thing and gave rise to a tremendous row in the Society; Frohme was given a dressing-down and is said to have declared that he hadn't met a single socialist, let alone a human being, in London.
He's unlikely to reappear for some time to come.
He has left me alone, I'm glad to say.
Many thanks for the Deutsches Tageblatt which I return herewith.
To reply to Bernhard Becker's balderdash would be doing him too great an honour.
What the ex-president of mankind 2 °2 writes and the Tageblatt prints is a matter of complete indifference, and even in Berlin it has long been forgotten.
This kind of impotent malice chokes on its own bile.
But what sort of press must it be to print such stuff? Even the Parisian Figaristes were more adept liars, albeit only during the period of general alarm immediately after the Commune.
All things considered, the March article was very good, with the right emphasis on essential points.
So, too, was the one in the next issue, about the People's Party 203 man preaching to the peasants, its only fault being to invoke the 'concept' of democracy.
b That concept changes according to the demos and hence does not get us one step fufther.
What in my view should have been said is this: For the sei­ zure of political power, democratic forms are also necessary to the pro­ letariat for whom, however, like all political forms, they are only a means.
But if, today, you want democracy as an end, you have to look for support to the peasants and petty bourgeoisie, i.

24 March 1884 their existence by factitious means, are reactionary in their relations with the proletariat.
Another thing that should not be forgotten is that the logical form of bourgeois rule is, precisely, a democratic re­ public which, however, has become too much of a risk only because of the progress already made by the proletariat, but which, as France and America go to show, is still feasible simply as bourgeois rule.
Re­ garded, therefore, as 'definite, historically evolved', the 'principle' of liberalism is really just an illogicality; a liberal constitutional monar­ chy is an adequate form of bourgeois rule 1 ) at the beginning, when the bourgeoisie has not yet quite done with absolute monarchy, and 2) at the end, when the proletariat has already rendered a democratic republic too much of a risk.
And yet a democratic republic is still the final form assumed by bourgeois rule, the form in which it comes to grief.
And here I conclude this rigmarole.

I am so bothered and pestered just now that not only my time, but also my room and my desk are not my own.
On Monday lasta we got clear of 41 Maitland Park Road, paid Willis and gave him the key.

Then I have been busy with the books, and was get­ ting clear—two more days would have settled the heavy work — when lo! the landlord sends the painters to do the house outside, and 24 March here we are, three dawdling fellows in the house, all windows open, every room invaded at the most unexpected hours, and to crown all, a bleak east-wind blowing inside as well as outside.
That I got as fine a specimen of rheumatism as could be wished for, was only natural.
Fortunately, if the dawdlers keep possession of the house even now, the east-wind has left us and so has, more or less, the rheumatism; and I am promised possession of my room for to-day,— on condition of giving it up to-morrow.
So let us enjoy the present while it lasts.
Nim says there is such a weight off her mind now since the old house is done with that she at last can sleep again, it was a nightmare for her which even an occasional nightcap of 'Irish' could not drive away.
Our place has much changed, two of my book-cases have gone below, the piano is in the corner between the fire-place and folding door (in the front room), the other corner filled up by one of Mohr's book-cases, while his large book-case (that behind his sofa) now takes the place where the piano stood in the back room.
As soon as the painters will have cleared out, I shall finish the sorting of the last heap of books, and then try and get off the last box of books, for you, there is a nice little lot of things relating to the French Revolution, Lousta-lot, Feuille Villageoise, Prisons de Paris pendant la Révolution, 20* etc.
, etc.
I have settled with Meissner that the 2nd book {^irkulationsprozess des Kapitals*) is to be published first separately; as soon as the gross work is finished, I can begin.
The 3rd book will follow, along with Theorien über den Mehrwert, b a long critical work forming part of the first ms.
of the Kapital (1862) which I have discovered.
171 The En­ glish translation is going on slowly, Sam has too much law-work to attend to, and is too conscientious to hurry on with it, 'regardless of quality'.
56 The movement here is showing more and more of its emptiness every week.
Justice drives me to despair by its utter incapacity of tack­ ling even one single question.
To-Day will live this next month en­ tirely by Davitt and Paul who you will have been glad to learn from Justice is the first living authority on French peasant property.
206 These fellows cannot even give a man his due without trying to make him look ridiculous.
Bax and Aveling are the only two, as far as I can see at present, of whom something can be made; but Bax has Kant on the brain and Aveling in order to live, has to keep a good many irons a The Process of Circulation of Capital -b Theories of Surplus Value 123 in the fire and is a perfect novice in everything relating to political economy.
Paul will no doubt see Bax at Roubaix 195; he and a work-ingmana have been delegated by the Democratic Federation," much against Hyndman's will who has lately made several attempts at forcing his personal plans and dodges upon them, but was ignomin-iously defeated: so he opposed sending delegates to Roubaix as he wanted to keep open the chance of a connexion with Brousse and Co.
That fellow will not go far: he cannot bide his time.
I am afraid Paul will be disappointed with regard to a German del­ egate to Roubaix; unless Liebknecht does come b; but as he has promised to do so, it is not likely.
The others do not speak French, ex­ cept perhaps Bernstein, and him the deputies are sure not to send, as they mostly hate him, and would replace him in Zurich if they could and dared.
Thanks to the great accession of petit bourgeois — gebildete Schafsköpfe^ our 'leaders' in Germany have become a sorry lot.
Anyhow I hope Roubaix will be a great success devant le public, d it will help on enormously; in the meantime I enclose the cheque £ 10.

A delegation to Roubaix would have done a great deal of harm at a moment when the Anti-Socialist Law3'was under discussion.
The wailers '2 3 would have apportioned the blame for its renewal — in any case inevitable — to that delegation alone; this had to be avoided.
Congresses are demonstrations and an occasion for useful personal encounters, and as such are of secondary importance, nor should more weighty considerations be sacrificed to them.
I shall try to make this clear to the Parisians.
In the circumstances, the address was the only thing possible and quite adequate.
'9 5 The very thought of an international congress in London 2 '2 appals me.
I should go away.
As regards the Rodbertus stuff, you would do best to wait until you have my preface to the Poverty^; you can't possibly be aware of the most important works, namely those concerning England (alluded to a K.

]") from which it is plain that the socialist applica­ tion of Ricardo's theory of value — Rodbertus' great hobby­ horse— had been an economic commonplace in England since 1820 and one universally known to socialists since 1830.
As I have, I be­ lieve, already written and told you,b I shall show, on the same occa­ sion, that, far from purloining the least thing from Rodbertus, Marx had, in the Poverty, unwittingly criticised in advance all the said Rod­ bertus' works, both written and unwritten.
I think we had best with­ hold our attack until the Poverty has come out in German, and then go it hot and strong (i.
e.
the main attack I mean; no harm at all in skirmishes to draw Rodbertus' fire).
I look forward to seeing the ms.
' '8 Notabene, should you have dif­ ficulty over the Hegelian expressions in the 2nd chapter, simply leave blanks in the ms.
and I will fill them in; the German version must contain the terminology proper to that school, otherwise it will be in­ comprehensible.
There were three copies of the 3rd edition.
c I racked my brains a bit over the Diihring that came with them and then simply laid it on one side, imagining it had got in by accident.
That it might be a hint about a 2nd edition never occurred to me.
I am delighted to find that this is so, more especially since I have learnt from various sources that the thing has been more influential — particularly in Russia—than 1 would ever have expected.
So after all the tedium of a polemic with an inconsiderable opponent has not prevented the attempt to present an encyclopaedic survey of our view of the problems pertaining to philosophy, natural science and history from taking effect.
I shall make virtually no changes but stylistic ones and, perhaps, add some­ thing to the section on natural science.
— Its earlier publication in 2 parts was due to the way the thing came out (as a separate edition), otherwise there would have been absolutely no sense in it.

Will hope the new arrangement may work at least for some time and without too much friction, though she b looks, from what you say, a rough subject enough to create any amount of that.
As to our 'Socialist' group here, I too am of opinion and said so, that Bax and Aveling are the only ones worth having, they at least study with a will, though not always a well directed one.
But the worst is, this little clique of public 'mutual admirators' and at least partially secret 'mutual detractors' (especially Hyndman) are getting a regular nuisance through their mischievous gossip.
First we hear from Sam Moore that he has heard in Manchester that Hyndman was busy translating the Kapital.
This mystery we have as yet not been able to sift thoroughly but it will probably turn out a canard.
Now, before we are well over that, those two busybodies in Paris 0 spread the report that Aveling was at it! The long and the short of this is as follows.
Aveling, who studies the German text, has translated a few pages for his own benefit.
When Hyndman was named as a possible competitor in the field, Sam at the same time declared that his own translation was getting on very slow, and he would be glad of some help.
So Aveling was mentioned; I looked over his work and found it utterly useless.
He was however very eager, and so, on his meeting Sam Moore here last week, it was arranged that he should try his hand at the chapter 'Der Arbeitstag', d this being chiefly de­ scriptive and free, comparatively, from difficult theoretical passages for which Aveling is totally unfit as jet, that is to say until he has worked himself through the whole book and understands it.
But at a Jean, Edgar, Marcel and Jenny Longuet -h a new housekeeper of the Longuets -c Ernest Belfort Bax and James Leigh Joynes -d 'The Working Day' the same time I said to Sam that I made it a condition that you should be asked also to take a share in the work, of which Sam was very glad, and now I come to ask you to choose one.
The matter stands at present as follows: Sam is now doing the 1st Abschnitt 11 from the beginning, we have gone over part of his 1st chapter and it is very good, though we shall revise it again.
He intends going on to the end, page 127 (2nd edi­ tion) and the most difficult parts (p.

h p.
318-529, this being rather technical, and so is the 6th Abschnitt: der Arbeitslohn? The 7th: die Akkumula­ tion? I should suppose, would suit you best.
But choose for yourself.
Any technical terms for which it might be difficult to find the English equivalent in Paris, you might leave room for, we could hunt them up here or in Manchester and fill them in.
As all parts of the translation pass through my hands, I can easily restore the unity of expression (the application of the same technical terms throughout the book).
If you accept our proposal, as I hope you will, and choose a section for yourself, we shall have fulfilled at least partially Mohr's wish and have your name and your work associated with this translation which I am convinced more and more every day is an absolute necessity, if the present movement here is not to collapse like a pricked ball by its own inanity; and we shall also be able to hasten the publication.
Tussy has undertaken to hunt up all the quotations from Blue Books ' 6 ' and to transcribe the original passages so as to avoid re-translation and errors unavoidably connected with it.
She will also see Kegan Paul as soon as possible, may be to-day (the Easter holi­ days stopped action in that direction), and arrange an interview for me with him when we hope we may be able to settle business matters; we shall then also know whether there is any truth in the Hyndman report.

I, Paris, 1956 75 ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 196 IN PARIS London, 18 April 1884 My dear Paul, A quarter to 5 — so must hurry! My congratulations on the success of your Congress, '9 5 a success that is evident from the different way in which the earlier and later meetings are reported in the Journal de Roubaix.
The Germans did right in not sending a delegate, for had they done so it would have a Cartes de visite; small photographic portraits mounted on a card -b 21 April -c of the third German edition of Volume I of Capital unduly facilitated the further retention of the Exceptional Law37 by the government and the bourgeoisie; the moderates in our party (very numerous among the leaders, very few among the masses, who are first-rate) would have exploited this; such a mistake would have been impermissible.
In cases of this kind, demonstrations, even interna­ tional ones, must be foregone.
When shall I get back the ms.
of the translationa? This time you re­ ally must try harder, I beg of you.
It is essential that the thing should either be done well or not at all.
And when will it be possible to begin printing? I ask this so that I can make arrangements to write a few notes and a short preface b—if you like you can do a preface and send it to me here.
You asked that you be given precedence over the Ger­ man edition; but I have got a complete ms.
of the first part of the lat­ ter and the Zurich people will begin printing the moment a manu­ script reaches them.
What with this German text and the English Capital to revise,56 my hands are full, and accordingly I wish ho know how to arrange things so as to avoid unnecessary loss of time.
For it's essential that I get down to the 2nd volumec— and now Zurich has to inform me of the need for a 2nd edition of my Anti-Diihring206 and a 4th of the Peasant War,2 '3 which means further revisions and further prefaces to be done! And that's what I — and Mr Bismarck — have gained from the banning of my books in Germany! Old William d is more or less in extremist He no longer recognises those who come to see him, nor can he repeat the phrases he has been taught to say by rote in reply to deputations.
Nim has just come back from shopping, she sends you her 'amours' (LOVES) and as much as you want of them.

positively be unable to ban.
But with the best will in the world I found it impossible.
The chapter on monogamy and the final chap­ ter on private ownership as the source of class antagonisms and also as the detonator that exploded the old communal system I find absol­ utely impossible to couch in such a way as to comply with the Anti-Socialist Law.
37 As Luther said: Let the devil come and fetch me, I cannot do otherwise.
214 Nor would there be any point in the thing if I intended to write merely an 'objective' review and not deal with Morgan critically, if I did not try to evaluate the results recently achieved or present them in the light of our views and of what has already been achieved.
Our workers would get nothing out of it.
So — good and necessarily ban­ ned, or — permitted and execrable.
The latter I cannot do.
I shall probably (Schorlemmer is here again until Monday") be fin­ ished next week.
It will amount to a full 4 sheets or more.
If you are then willing to risk publishing it in the Neue £eit (after you have read it) may any blood that is spilt as a result be on your own heads and don't blame me afterwards.
If you are sensible, however, and do not wish to jeopardise the whole periodical for the sake of one article, you will do better to print it as a pamphlet either in Zurich or in the same way as Frau.
138 But that is your own look-out.
I think the thing will have a particularly important bearing on our general view.
Morgan enables us to present entirely new aspects by providing us, in the shape of prehistory, with a factual basis we have hitherto lacked.
Whatever doubts you may still entertain about indi­ vidual primitives and 'savages', with the gens the case has been large­ ly resolved and prehistory elucidated.
And that is why the thing should be thoroughly worked on, properly weighediip and presented as a coherent whole—but also dealt with without regard for the Anti-Socialist Law.
And there's another most important point: I must show how bril­ liantly Fourier has anticipated Morgan in so many things.
It is thanks to Morgan that for the first time the brilliance of Fourier's critique of civilisation really comes across.
And that will mean a lot of work.

Since I do not see any of the Paris papers, it is only from The Stand­ ard and from yourself that I know what is going on; your electoral tactics are just what I myself would have recommended 2 '6 — these people will do themselves in if left to their own devices; GIVE THEM PLENTY OF ROPE AND THEY ARE SURE TO HANG THEMSELVES.
However, BemStein wrote and told me that you had put up a candidate" in opposition to Joffrin, and that he thought this ill-advised; let me know what the cir­ cumstances are so that I can answer him.
Thank you for the article — it is only the first one and I cannot now remember if I wrote the sequel.
217 I have only seen the first number of Vaillant's translation.
It is good and accurate, save that he does not always appear to be con­ versant with military terminology.
Your lectures and those of Deville are excellent '79 but, at least for the published version, you should develop more exhaustively the con-Louis Simon Dereure; see this volume, p.

135 elusions of your second one on Darwinism.
That part seems over­ whelmed by the mass of premisses leading up to the conclusion, nor is the latter self-evident enough, while its detail is inadequately devel­ oped.
I have not yet read the third one.
As soon as the translation of The Poverty of Philosophy has been completed in Zurich, ' '8 I shall suggest that they bring out the lectures in German.
I shall now withdraw, having a rather important piece of work to complete: The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State,11* which I hope to have rid myself of by the end of next week.
Until then I must soldier on.
Give Laura a kiss from me and from Nim, who also sends one to you.

of chapters 1-8 b ; it went off to you yesterday by registered mail.
As I have already suggested, I think the best thing to do, if you want to use some of it for the Neue £eit, would be to take the chapter on the family with the exception of mo­ nogamy.
0 It anticipates the latter to the extent necessary to produce a fairly well rounded whole.
As to the ban, I have already written and told you that everything by me is banned on principled ; 'Prussian Schnapps' was a personal in­ sult to Bismarck and, now that Richter has used it to concoct a policy of his own for schnapps, 220 the schnapps and wrapping-paper man will henceforward give me no rope at all.
Anyhow all your argu­ ments 2 2 ' fall to the ground with the successful endorsement of the Anti-Socialist Law222 and with the banning of the Süddeutsche Post that immediately ensued.
223 And the government can afford to be harsh when letting fly with its bans; proof of this is provided by the lib­ eral press which is literally clamouring for vigorous action against us.
You, as an Austrian, cannot possibly follow the reasoning that a 18 May-b of Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the Stale-" See this volume, p.

goes on in the minds of people like Bismarck, Puttkamer & Co.
; for that you would have to be familiar with the Prussian police regime before 1848; to restore this to full bloom by means of the Anti-Socialist Law is the prime motive of these Junker bureaucrats.
Everything else — at home — is secondary.
I have not yet heard anything further about the Diihrings that are stored here.
a I have Rodbertus' Kapital.
Seems to be nothing in it.
A repository of the most meagre material, endlessly repeated.
The things from the archives are being carefully looked after at my house and I shall be punctilious about returning them.
224 As soon as I have polished off the final chapter and put various other things — books, etc.
— in the house in order, I shall tackle the 2nd volume of Capital—in the daytime; in the evenings I shall first of all revise your Poverty of Philosophy 118 and do the notes and preface for it.
b This ap­ portionment is not only useful but absolutely essential, since one does not study Marx's handwriting by lamplight for any length of time un­ less one is intent on going blind.
Moreover my critique of Rodbertus will be confined in the main simply to the accusation of plagiarism 225 and all the rest — his social Salvationist Utopias, rent, mortgage relief for the landed aristocracy, etc.
, only mentioned in passing.
So you will have sufficient material to administer a sound thrashing to this little Pomeranian exploiter of cottagers,2 2 6 who might have become a second-rate economist had he not been a Pomeranian.
Now that the milksops, who cling to us on the one hand and to the armchair social­ ists 54 on the other with the intention of protecting both their flanks, have, à la Freiarsch Thüringer, 0 played off the 'great d Rodbertus' against Marx, and now that Adolph Wagner and other Bismarckians have actually elevated the same to the rank of prophet of careerist so­ cialism, 227 we have absolutely no cause to spare this prodigy invent­ ed by Rodbertus himself and loudly extolled by Meyer (who knows nothing about economics and, in the former, possessed his own secret oracle).
The man achieved absolutely nothing in the field of econom­ ics; he had much talent, but always remained a dilettante and, above all, an ignorant Pomeranian and arrogant Prussian.

All that is necessary to begin with, I think, is for the gentry to be thrown off the scent; once you have managed to do that, the old route, or parts of it, can again be made use of.
The stupidity of the police will see to the rest.
228 I ordered Rodbertus' Normal-Arbeitstag, but it was out of print.
I should be grateful if you could let me have the thing — on loan, of course,— since it contains the only authentic version of his proposed labour reforms.
— I am now returning the issues of the old Social-Demokrat by REGISTERED MAIL, 224 having discovered that Lessner pos­ sesses them.
The translation to be agreed with Lafargue is still pen­ ding, a which is why I had to have the original here; now, of course, it can be returned.
" See this volume, pp.
116-17.
Singer has been over here and I informed him, amongst other things, of my views regarding the tactics to be adopted in the case of final ballots.
For I consider it nonsensical to try and set up universally applicable rules for these which, when it actually comes to the point, are never adhered to.
We have great potential power of which no use at all will be made if abstention from the polls is prescribed in all cases where none of our people are involved in the final ballot.
As it hap­ pens, in all such cases electoral pacts — e.
g.
with the Centre229 — invariably come into being automatically: We shall vote for you here if you vote for us there, and many a seat have we acquired thus.
Blun­ ders may result of course, but blunders will always be made, nor is this any reason for committing an even greater one.
I therefore told him that, in places like Berlin, for instance, where the electoral cam­ paign is virtually confined to ourselves and the men of Progress,9 3 pacts before the general election were not out of the question — you cede us that constituency and in return we cede you this one — but only, of course, if one can count on their being observed.
What I con­ sider inept is, in effect, the attempt by congresses to formulate in ad­ vance universally valid rules for as yet non-existent tactical cases.
Au fond, a I am glad that the Anti-Socialist Law has been renewed and not repealed forthwith.
222 The liberal philistine would have se­ cured a tremendous electoral victory for the Conservatives230; in order to preserve the Anti-Socialist Law he would not only go through fire and water, but wade through the deepest of cess-pits.
And it would only have resulted in another, more draconian law.
As it now stands, it has probably been renewed for the last time and will, once old Wilm b succumbs to his nephritis, soon cease to exist in prac­ tice.
And the thorough discrediting of the German Free Thinkers 2 31 and of the Centre Party in the course of the division 232 is also of some value, though not as much as Bismarck's right to work.
233 Now that that addle-pate has taken this up there's a chance of our ridding our­ selves of the wailersI23 à la Geiser.
Come to that, no one but a Bis­ marck could perpetrate such a blunder in the face of a workers' movement that cannot be kept down even by means of emergency laws.
For the present our people are right to press for implementation and thus implicate him as deeply as possible; the moment the man has committed himself a bit more (though he is not likely to do so very soon), the whole imposture will resolve itself—into Prussian police a On the whole-b William I 141 chicanery.
Qua electoral programme, the slogan by itself will do him damn' all good.
The right to work was Fourier's idea but realised in his case only in the phalanstère, 2 3 4 and thus presupposes the adoption of the latter.
The Fourierists — peace-loving philistines of Démocratie pacifique, as their paper was called — disseminated the slogan precisely because it sounded safe.
The Parisian workers of 1848 swallowed it whole — it being something theoretically utterly unclear — because it seemed so practical, so non-utopian, so readily realisable.
The govern­ ment realised it — in the only way it could be realised in a capitalist society — in the form of preposterous national workshops.
235 Similarly in this country, during the 1861-64 cotton crisis, the right to work was realised in Lancashire in the form of municipal work­ shops.
And in Germany it is likewise being realised in those hunger and cudgel workers' colonies about which your philistine is now enthusing.
Advanced as a separate demand, the right to work cannot be realised in any other form.
The demand for its realisation by capital­ ist society can only be met by the latter within the terms of its own existence, but if the demand for the right to work be made of that so­ ciety, then it is made on these specific terms and hence is a demand for national workshops, workhouses and [workers'] colonies.
But if the demand for the right to work is to comprise indirectly the demand for the subversion of the capitalist mode of production, it is, in regard to the present state of the movement, a dastardly piece of tergiversa­ tion, a concession to the Anti-Socialist Law, a slogan whose only pur­ pose can be to bemuse and befuddle the workers as to the aims they ought to pursue and the only terms upon which they can attain them.
In the Paris municipal elections, our people have in fact pursued the tactics recommended by you, only putting up Dereure against Joffrin because there was at first no Opportunist236 standing against him, so that in this instance opposition was pretty well obligatory.
Simoneau did not come upon the scene until later, whereupon Guesde immediately demanded that Dereure withdraw; but at this point Dereure's courage failed him and thus he suffered a resounding de­ feat.
Vaillant, on the other hand, triumphed over the Possibilists 2 3 7 in his arrondissement, for Retiès was a tosspot [poivrard) of the worst repute and was deservedly defeated.
And if Joffrin was defeated in the final ballot, it was not our people but his who were to blame.
It will, by the way, be necessary to go on opposing the Possibilists until they deign to come to an agreement with our chaps at election time; so long as they simply go on making themselves out to be the parti ouvrier par excellence, a they will force our chaps into direct opposition.
So either — or; it's for those gentlemen to decide.
As regards Joffrin in particular, his programme was so lousy and lukewarm that even the Radicals refrained from putting up a rival candidate, Joffrin's programme being, in essence, their own\ Over here Justice gets more wretched by the week.

" Engels an Eduard Bernstein, Berlin, 1925 84 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 26 May 1884 My dear Laura, Since the receipt of your letter of the 15 th we have had sorrowful times.
On the 18th Pumps' little boy died and was buried on the 22nd.
* workers' party par excellence 143 The child suffered from whooping-cough, bronchitis, convulsions and croup, there was but little hope a week before he died.
I was under the impression Pumps or Percy had written to you, and they it seems relied on me for letting you know; well, I was busy finishing my pamphleta to which I postponed even the most pressing letters — and finishing it, as you may conceive, under difficulties of every sort.
Well, it's done, the last sheets go off tomorrow.
How long they will be over the printing of it, I don't know.
I am sorry you won't go in for the 'Akkumulationsprozess des Ka­ pitals'.
b Think it over again.
I am afraid we cannot do without help from without, and to tell you the truth I have deuced little confidence in what assistance I may get here.
Aveling has den besten Willen" but he is to translate strange matter aus einem ihm unbekannten Deutsch in ein ihm unbekanntes Englisch d; if it was natural science it would be easy enough, but political economy and industrial facts where he is not ac­ quainted even with the commonest terms.
And Sam 6 who is doing the first chapter far better than I expected, takes such a time over it.
And yet it is daily becoming a greater necessity to have it out, and Kegan Paul and Co.
with whom I expect to come to terms soon, are pressing, but unless I can promise the ms.
by say November, com­ plete, I cannot well conclude anything.
You might try a few pages and see how you get on.
A German-English dictionary would be use­ less; the words you would have to look for, you would not find there; you could leave space for them, and I could fill them in, they will mostly be technical or philosophical terms.
Paul's conferences'" are a great success, 179 the New Yorker Volkszeit-ung brings them regular, their own translation, I believe.
If the French had two or three people who could and would assimilate Ger­ man publications in the same manner, it would help them on im­ mensely.
I foresee that when my Ursprung der Familie etc.
g comes out, Paul will be mad after translating it, there are things in it just in his line, h but if he begins he will have to take the German words in their own sense and not in the sense he pleases to impart to them, because I shall have no time whatever to work at it.
I shall now start with the 2nd volume [of] Kapital and work at it during daylight, the evenings a The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State -b The reference is to Part VII of the first volume of Capital, see also this volume, p.

will be for the revision of the various translations in hand and threaten­ ed.
This pamphlet I just finished will be the last independent work for some time to come.
Will you please tell Deville that I have not as yet had the time to read his last conférence, but shall do so before the week is out and hope it is as good as its predecessors.
Now I must conclude, it is past eleven and Nim is moving for bed, she has got 'pains all over', id est slight muscular rheumatism in conse­ quence of cold, and she must stand at the door while I post this letter, as Annie is in bed, so in order to keep Nim no longer from her much needed rest (she has slept a bit in her arm-chair already) I hope you will excuse the blank space at the foot of this.
By the way, it appears Liebknecht has been in Paris, the German papers tell the most extraordinary things about his mysterious pro­ ceedings, 238 also that he spoke at a banquet together with that muff Lecler.

I, Paris, 1956 85 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN IN ZURICH London, 5 June 1884 Dear Ede, Have spent a week at the seaside.
239 While there I got a nasty cut on my right index finger and hence can only write briefly and badly.
So Kautsky will have to wait, the Sozialdemokrat being* more important a Henri Leclère than the Neue ^eit and, in the latter's case, the circumstances are such that it makes no difference anyway whether I stick my oar in or not.
Besides I consider that all Kautsky's moves, in so far as he has told me about them and in so far as I am able to judge the situation, have been absolutely correct.
240 As regards the Sozialdemokrat, it is a rather different matter.
Now that their worships, the wailers, '2 3 have formally combined into a party and constitute a majority in the parliamentary group, 49 now that they have recognised, and are exploiting, the power they have acquired thanks to the Anti-Socialist Law,3 ' I consider it to be more than ever our duty to defend all our own vantage points to the utmost, especially our vantage point on the Sozialdemokrat, which is the most important of all.
These people live off the Anti-Socialist Law.
Were there to be free discussion tomorrow, I should be all for letting fly at once, in which case they would soon come to grief.
But so long as there is no free dis­ cussion, so long as they control all the papers printed in Germany and their numbers (as the majority of the 'leaders') enable them to make the very most of gossip, intrigue, whispering campaigns, we, I believe, must steer clear of anything that might lead to a breach, or rather might lay the blame for that breach at our door.
That is the universal rule when there is a struggle within one's own party, and now it applies more than ever.
The breach must be so contrived that we continue to lead the old party while they either resign or are chucked out.
Then the timing.
Just now everything is in their favour.
We cannot, after the breach, stop them from slandering and reviling us in Ger­ many, from posing as the representatives of the masses (for the masses do elect them after all!).
We have only the Sozialdemokrat and the foreign press.
They can gain a hearing, we can only do so with diffi­ culty.
So if we precipitate a breach at this moment, the great mass of the party will claim not without justification that we have sown dis­ cord, have disorganised the party at the very time when, beset by dangers, it is laboriously reorganising itself.
If we can avoid it, the breach ought to be postponed, and this is still my view, until some change in Germany gives us rather more elbow room.
If a breach becomes inevitable nevertheless, it must not be of the personal kind, it must not involve any rows (or what could be repre­ sented as such) between e.
g.
you and the Stuttgarters 2 '9; rather the occasion for it must be a quite specific point of principle, i.
e.
in this case of an infringement of the programme.
Rotten though the pro­ gramme may be, a cursory perusal of it will enable you to find enough in it to support your argument.
241 The programme, however, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the parliamentary group.
The breach must be prepared in advance to the extent that Bebel, for one, agrees to it and at once goes along with you.
And, thirdly, you must know what you want and are able to do once the breach has been made.
To allow the Sozialdemokrat to pass into the hands of these people would be to make the German party the laughing-stock of the entire world.
The worst thing of all in such a case is impatience; decisions made on the spur of the moment and dictated by passion always seem to one­ self tremendously noble and heroic, but they regularly lead to blun­ ders, as I know only too well from a hundred examples from my own practical experience.
So: 1) postpone the breach for as long as possible, 2) if it becomes inevitable, make sure that it emanates from them, 3) get everything ready in the meantime, 4) do nothing without Bebel, for one, and poss­ ibly also Liebknecht, who will again be good for something (possibly too good) once he sees that the thing is inevitable and, 5) defend your vantage point on the Sozialdemokrat envers et contre tous, a down to your last cartridge.
That is my view.
You could certainly repay the 'condescension' of these gentlemen a thousand times over.
You're certainly never at a loss for a ready an­ swer in other respects and can certainly confront those jackasses with enough irony as well as disdain to make them rue this behaviour.
There can be no serious discussion with ignoramuses like these who glory in their own ignorance; rather, they must be derided, hoist with their own petard, etc.
Don't forget either that, should things come to a head, my hands are very much tied by the vast amount of work ahead of me and I shan't be able to join in the fray to the extent I might wish to do.
I should also be grateful if, instead of general complaints about the philistines, you could give me a few details of what they object to and what they demand.
Nota bene, the longer you negotiate with them, the greater the amount of self-incriminating material they must inevit­ ably supply you with! Write and tell me how far I ought to go into these matters when against all-comers 147 corresponding with Bebel; I shall have to write to him shortly and in­ tend to put off doing so until Monday the 9th inst.
, by which time I may have had a reply from you.
Regards to Kautsky.

^ ,-, ,-• <-Published in English lor the nrst time 86 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 88 IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG" London, 6 June 1884 Dear Bebel, Have received your letter of the 4th inst.
and shall attend to the en­ closure.
You do not say whether you got my registered letter of 21 April,3 9 in which I returned the envelope, its seal broken, of your letter of the 18th ofthat month.
If it has been intercepted, then the Stiebe-rising of letters has been doubly proven.
242 If everything were to go according to the wishes of the Conserva­ tives 2 3 ° and Liberals,2 4 3 and likewise accord to the secret yearnings of the progressist philistines,93 there can be no doubt that the Anti-Socialist Law 3 7 would long since have been perpetuated as an insti­ tution in Germany and that it would so remain.
But that can only happen if nothing happens elsewhere in the world, and everything re­ mains as it is now.
Despite all these philistine desires, the Law was on the very brink of disaster when friend Bismarck applied his two last and most powerful levers — Lehmann's direct intervention210 and the threat of dissolution.
244 Hence it would not even require a par­ ticularly violent convulsion of the present status quo, peaceful as it is, to put an end to the whole caboodle.
And in my opinion this will surely happen before two years are out.
True, Bismarck has, for the first time, played a really nasty trick on us by procuring 300 million marks for the Russians.
182 That will give the Tsara a couple of years' respite from an acute financial emer­ gency and thus temporarily eliminate the danger that looms larg­ est— the necessity of having to convene the Estates for the voting of subsidies, as in France in 1789 and Prussia in 1846.
If the revolution in Russia is not to be put back by several years, there must either be some unforeseen complications or else a couple of nihilistic thun­ derbolts.
b Neither of these can be counted on to happen.
All we may be sure of is that the recent borrowing operation cannot be repeated.
At home, on the other hand — as you yourself say — a change of monarch is imminent and is bound to make everything totter.
Here again it is as it was in 1840, before the death of old Frederick Wil­ liam III.
So many interests are bound up with the old familiar state of political stagnation that there is nothing the heart of Philistia as a whole desires more fervently than its perpetuation.
But with the old monarch0 the keystone disappears and the whole artificial structure collapses.
The afore-mentioned interests, faced with an entirely new situation, suddenly discover that the world of today looks completely different from that of yesterday, and that they will have to look round for new mainstays.
The new monarch d and his new entourage have plans that have long been suppressed; the whole body of those who govern or are capable of governing expands and changes; officials are perplexed by the new conditions, and the insecurity of the future, the uncertainty about who will be at the helm tomorrow or the day after, causes the action of the entire government machine to falter.
That, however, is all we require.
But we shall get more.
For in the first place we may be sure that while, at the start, the new government may have liberalising aspirations, it will soon become frightened at its own daring, will vacillate hither and thither and eventually grope its way hither and thither, living from hand to mouth, from instance to in­ stance, each decision conflicting with the next.
Aside from the general effect of this vacillation, what will become of the Anti-Socialist Law if it is administered under these conditions? The slightest attempt to ad­ minister it 'fairly' would be enough to render it ineffective.
Either it has to be operated as at present, purely at the whim of the police, or it a Alexander III -b Cf.

-c William I-d Crown Prince Frederick William 149 will everywhere be broken.
— That is one aspect.
But there is another, namely that then, at last, some animation will return to the bourgeois political scene, the official parties will cease to be the one reactionary mass they now are (which is no gain to us, but rather a dead loss), and again begin seriously combatting one another and likewise strug­ gling for political supremacy.
It will make a tremendous difference to us whether, on the one hand, both National Liberals and Crown Prince Free Thinkers23 ' have a chance of coming to the helm, or whether, as now, the ability to govern is confined to the liberal Con­ servatives.
We shall never be able to lure the masses away from die lib­ eral parties so long as the latter are not given an opportunity of dis­ crediting themselves in practice, of taking the helm and demonstrat­ ing their ineptitude.
As in 1848, we are still the opposition of the fu­ ture and must, therefore, have the most extreme among the existing parties at the helm before being able to confront it as the opposition of the present.
Political stagnation, i.
e.
aimless and purposeless strug­ gle between the official parties, as at present, can be of no service to us in the long run.
What could, however, is a progressive struggle be­ tween those parties, with the centre of gravity gradually shifting to the Left.
That's what is currently happening in France where, as al­ ways, the course of the political struggle has assumed a classical form.
The successive governments are moving ever further to the Left, and a Clemenceau government is already in sight; it will not be the most extreme bourgeois government.
With every shift to the Left, conces­ sions accrue to the workers (cf.
the recent strike at Denain in which, for the first time, the military did not intervene 245) and, more impor­ tant still, the field is being increasingly cleared for the decisive battle, while the position of the parties becomes more distinct and well-defined.
This slow but inexorable progress of the French Republic to­ wards its logical conclusion — the confrontation between radical would-be socialist bourgeois and genuinely revolutionary workers — I consider to be a manifestation of the utmost importance, and I hope that nothing will happen to stop it.
And I am glad that our people are not yet strong enough in Paris (but all the stronger for that in the provinces) to be misled by the force of revolutionary phrases into attempting a putsch.
— In muddle-headed Germany, needless to say, progress is not being made along the same purely classical lines as in France; we have lagged much too far behind for that, and every­ thing we experience has already had its day elsewhere.
But despite the rottenness of our official parties, political life of some description would be of far greater advantage to us than the present political death in which action is confined to the secret intrigues of foreign policy.
Sooner than I expected, friend Bismarck has lowered his trousers and shown the assembled people the posterior of his right to work 233 — an amalgam of the Poor Act of the 43rd year of the reign of Elizabeth and the Bastille amendment of 1834.
246 What bliss for Bios, Geiser and Co.
who have, after all, been riding the hobby-horse of the right to work for some time now a and who already seem to imag­ ine that it was they who had roped in Bismarck! And, having once embarked on this topic, I feel impelled to tell you that the perfor­ mance of these gentry, both in the Reichstag — in so far as one can judge from the inadequate newspaper reports — and in their own press, has increasingly convinced me that /, at least, do not even re­ motely share their standpoint or have anything at all in common with them.
These allegedly 'educated' but in fact utterly ignorant and ob­ stinately ineducable philanthropists, who were not only admitted in the face of Marx's and my long and oft reiterated warnings, but were actually shepherded into the Reichstag, would seem to me to be be­ coming increasingly aware that they are in a majority in the parlia­ mentary group and that it is precisely they who, with their time­ serving attitude towards every crumb of state socialism tossed to them by Bismarck, more than any one else, are concerned that the Anti-Socialist Law should remain in force and that it should be applied le­ niently, if at all, to well-meaning persons like themselves — again something which only people like you and I prevent the government from doing, for if these, the afore-mentioned philanthropists, were rid of us it would be easy for them to prove that there was no call for an Anti-Socialist Law where they were concerned.
Their abstention as well as their general performance in connection with the Dynamite Bill was likewise typical.
247 But what's going to happen at the next election '94 if, as seems probable, the safest constituencies fall to these chaps? It is a great pity that, during the next few critical months, you will be so far away; now, with the elections upon us, we should certainly have had occasion to tell each other a great deal.
Could you not let me have an address from which my letters could be forwarded to you? I also hope you may sometimes be able to send me some interesting information about your trip.

151 Apart from what seems to me steady progress and increasing cohe­ sion on the part of the eddicated bourgeois elements of the party, I am not at all anxious about the course things are taking.
I would, if possible, rather see a split avoided so long as we have no freedom of action.
But if it has to be — and it is for you people to decide, then so be it! A work of mine on the origin of the family, property and the state is about to appear.
As soon as it comes out I shall send it to you.

Published in English in full for the first time 87 ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER IN GENEVA London, 20 June 1884 Dear Old Man, I hereby notify you that I have today taken out a £5 money order on your behalf and hope the post office will have advised you of its re­ ceipt by the time this letter arrives — it goes off by the next post.
I have long looked forward to being able to make the above available and am glad that the moment has now come.
However, I cannot, alas, write you a long letter since, in my par­ ticular condition, prolonged sitting at my desk is bad for me and conse­ quently prohibited.
Unfortunately I have again knocked myself up a bit by doing so, for I have had a great deal of work to get through; but resting in a prone position, as I have again been doing most assid­ uously for the past few days, will soon put me to rights again.
I am now dictating the 2nd volume of Capital,* and so far it has been go-" Presumably to Oskar Eisengarten (see this volume, p.
153).
ing quite quickly, but it's the devil of a job and will demand a great deal of time and, in parts, much brain-racking.
Luckily my brain is in pretty good shape and quite up to the mark where work is concerned as you will, I hope, be able to see from a little book on the origin of the family, private property and the state soon to be published.
The second book of Capital will also, I think, come out before the end of the year, and the third next year.
At Whitsuntide I spent a week with Borkheim 239; he is still laid up, with one side half paralysed, gets up three times a day for meals and to do some writing, is writing his biography,248 and is in good spirits and surprisingly cheerful for one in his condition, but some­ times suffers terribly from boredom.
Moreover, he cannot read any­ thing that demands much effort — not that he ever really has done.
I send him books and the like every so often.
He asked fondly after you and, in fact, we talked a great deal about you and about the old days.
Amongst Marx's papers I have found a few military campaign journals and the like relating to German columns in Switzerland which, no doubt, form part of the papers you mention.
'26 Some more may turn up.
Everything is safely here, but is still in a state of com­ plete disorder.
For the time being I shall have to lock away all corres­ pondence, etc.
, in a large trunk until I have time to sort the stuff out and put it in order.
But now it is absolutely essential that a text, both printable and written in a legible hand, be produced of the final vol­ umes of Capital.
Neither of these things can be done by any one now alive save for myself.
If I were to kick the bucket first, no one else could possibly decipher the things which Marx himself was often un­ able to read, although his wife and I could do so.
The letters, on the other hand, are written in such a way that others can read them.
In three or four months' time we shall be having elections in Ger­ many.
194 I am extremely optimistic.
There are many milksops amongst the leaders, but my faith in the masses is unshakable.

240 According to what I hear from Ede and also from August, b something of a damper has since been put on the passions of the Wise Men.
219 It is high time, too, that I heard something definite concerning the fate of my ms.
c Ede dropped me a pencilled note and promised something more, but did = 0.
Your ms.
' '8 still reposes here and has not yet been attended to for the following reason.
After having completed the ms.
c I was like a cat on hot bricks until I could begin work on Volume II of Capital.
I did so.
Next, I proposed to set about revising your work, as also the En­ glish translation (of the 1st volume of Capital) ,5 6 in the evenings.
But I had reckoned without my host.
I had been hard at it since Easter, often spending 8 or 10 hours at my desk and, as a result of the posture this involved, my former indisposition partially reappeared — this time in chronic, not in its previous sub-acute, form.
So desk work was again forbidden, sauf quelques exceptions.
d I therefore took the heroic step of engaging Eisengarten so that I might dictate the ms.
to him and, since the beginning of the week, he and I have been slogging away from 10 to 5 every day, during which time I lie on the sofa, re­ covering visibly (idiotic word — nothing to be seen, only felt) but, of course, slowly.
The thing's going far better than expected.
Eisengarten is intelligent and hard-working and puts his heart into the thing, the more so since he is just working his way through the 3rd edition of the 1st volume.
But most of the mss.
are such that I have to spend every evening going through what I have dictated if I am to produce a text that is even provisionally valid.
At the moment this takes up all my available time.
But I believe that things will improve, as we are * Stuttgart-11 Bebel-C The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State-d save for a few exceptions now coming to the original gospel written before 1870, which means that there will be less re-editing.
'7 Anyway, I couldn't very well have revised your ms.
lying down.
But if you are in a hurry, I shall find the time and do it all at one go.
There could be no question of this, how­ ever, nor for that matter, any necessity for it, unless you had got al­ most all of it done.
I shall then — if not before — also let you have the preface about Rodbertus.
a For the rest, I shall not discuss in detail your complaints about the eddicated chaps; I have known these worthies in this guise or that for 40 years now and have already given Ede my opinion of them at some length.
b The main thing is not to let oneself be browbeaten and, at the same time, retain one's composure.
The dynamiters have at long last discovered just what to do.
They are concerned with striking at the root of the old social order, and now it transpires that the root in question is in fact the tail.
This pro­ found truth with which they are imbued eventually enabled them to discover how best to set about it, and they went and blew up a pis-soir.
2 5 ' Which reminds me that the man behind the Geneva-Carouge Explosion is none other than the Italian mouchard,c Carlo Terzaghi, who had already been unmasked by us in The Alliance of Socialist Democracy.
252 The expelled Austrian anarchists253 purport to be connected with the regular German charities which have long existed over here.
One of them touched me for alms but was unmasked and, upon his return­ ing today, was chucked out at top speed.
The 2nd book of Capital will give us even more headaches, at least to start off with, than the first one.
But it contains quite admirable analyses that will, for the first time, show people what is money and what capital and much else.
But now it is time to lie down again.
All things considered, and apart from the localised trouble, I'm as fit as a fiddle, and my brain is in first-class condition.

Hyndman intends to buy up the whole of the little move­ ment here.
He has done everything he can think of to ruin To-Day.
Bax, who advanced the money for the purpose, got his sums wrong and was soon cleaned out.
Hyndman, who is rich and also has access to the resources of Morris, a very rich but politically inept art lover, will either take To-Day under his wing or let it perish.
Either way, he believes, he will reign supreme.
I am glad that I have remained aloof from the whole caboodle.
Hyndman is shrewd and a good business man, but superficial and STOCK-JOHN-BULL; moreover his ambition far outruns his talents and achievements.
Bax and Aveling have the best of intentions and are, besides, learning by degrees, but everything's at sixes and sevens, nor can these literati do anything on their own.
The fact is that the masses are not yet going along with them.
Once the chaps have sorted themselves out a bit it will be better.

254 goes back tomorrow by registered mail.
I found little that called for comment and have made a few pencilled notes.
Apart from these I would add the following: 1) Roman Law is the consummation of the law of simple, i.
e.
of precapitalist, commodity production, though the latter also embodies much of the legal system of the capitalist period.
Exactly, that is, what our burghers needed at the time of their rise and, in accordance with local common law, did not get.
On p.
10 there are several things I object to: 1.
Surplus value is the exception only in the case of production by slaves and serfs.
It ought to read surplus product, most of which is directly consumed but not valorised.
2) As regards the means of production, the matter is not quite as you say.
In all societies based on a division of labour that has evolved naturally, the product, and hence also to some extent the means of production, dominates the producer — on occasion at any rate — as did, in the Middle Ages, the soil the peasant who was simply an ap­ purtenance of the land and the tool the guild handicraftsman.
Divi­ sion of labour is the direct domination of the instruments of labour over the worker, although not in the capitalist sense.
Much the same applies to the concluding bit on the means of pro­ duction.
1) You should not separate agriculture any more than technology from political economy, as you do on pp.
21 and 22.
Rotation of crops, artificial fertilisers, the steam engine, the power loom, cannot be separated from capitalist production any more than the tools of the savage and the barbarian from his production.
The tools of the savage condition his society just as much as do more modern ones ca­ pitalist society.
What your view boils down to is that, while produc­ tion does indeed determine the social institution today, it did not do so before capitalist production existed, because tools had not as yet been guilty of original sin.
The moment you say means of production, you say society and a society determined by, amongst other things, those means of produc­ tion.
Means of production as such, extraneous to society and without influence over it, exist no more than does capital as such.
But how the means of production, which, at earlier periods, includ­ ing that of simple commodity production, exercised only a very mild domination compared with now, came to exercise their present de­ spotic domination, is something that calls for proof and yours strikes me as inadequate, since it fails to mention one pole, namely the crea­ tion of a class which no longer had any means of production of its own, or, therefore, any means of subsistence, and hence was compel­ led to sell itself piecemeal.
In the case of Rodbertus' positive proposals, emphasis ought to be laid on his Proudhonism — after all he proclaimed himself Proud-hon I, the forerunner of the French Proudhon.
Constituted value, in­ vented by Rodbertus as early as 1842,255 is to be established.
His proposals here are lamentably retrograde by comparison with Bray and with Proudhon's exchange bank.
The worker is to get only '/4 of the product, but that is assured! We can discuss this later.
Repose (physical) is suiting me splendidly; I get better every day and this time the cure will be complete.
The dictation of the 2nd book of Capital is going ahead splendidly.
Wea have already reached Part II — but there are big gaps.
The editing is only provisional, of course, but that too will get done.
I can see my way ahead, cela suffit} Ede's letter received with thanks.
You will have to be patient with my letter-writing; I mustn't get run down again and a frightful amount of work and correspondence is piling up.

their revolutionary zeal than for their scientific studies, and while, here and there, some degree of trial and error may have been and may still be in evidence, we have, on the other hand, witnessed a criti­ cal spirit and a devotion to research, even in the field of pure theory, wholly worthy of a nation capable of producing a Dobrolyubov and a Chernyshevsky.
And here I speak, not only of the active revolution­ ary socialists, but of the historical and critical school in Russian liter­ ature, which is infinitely superior to anything of the kind produced in Germany and France by way of official history.
And even among active revolutionaries our ideas, and the science of economics as re­ modelled by Marx, have always met with an intelligent and sym­ pathetic response.
As you are doubtless aware, a number of our works have quite recently appeared in Russian translation, and are to be followed by others, notably Marx's Poverty of Philosophy.
His short work dating from before 1848, Wage Labour and Capital (HaeMHMÖ Tpy4i.
H KariHTaAt), has also appeared under that title in this se­ ries.
257 I am exceedingly flattered by your suggestion that a translation of my Outlines etc.
might prove useful.
Although still a little proud of this, my first work on social science, I am all too aware that it is now completely out of date and replete, not only with mistakes, but also with 'howlers'.
The misapprehensions it could hardly fail to engender would, I fear, quite outbalance such good as it might do.
I shall be sending you by post a copy of Diihring's Revolution etc? As for our old newspaper articles, it would be difficult to lay hands on them just now.
Most of them have little relevance today; as soon as the publication of the manuscripts left by Marx allows me sufficient leisure, I intend to bring them out as a collection with explanatory notes, etc.
But that will not be for some time to come.
I am not quite sure what you mean by the manifesto addressed to English working men.
Might it be THE CIVIL WAR IN FRANCE, the International's manifesto on the Paris Commune b? That I could send you.
If my health permitted, I should ask your permission to come and call on you; unfortunately I am not allowed to go out and about, though I feel reasonably well when at home.

I return Wage Labour and Capital* herewith.
The Silesian edi­ tion has certainly required a great deal of revision.
258 I did not, it is true, have time to compare it with the original throughout, but only those passages that worried me most.
However, you chaps have got it there and will be able to attend to that when correcting the proofs.

Schorlemmer writes to say that his brother Ludwig in Darm­ stadt has not yet received a single number of the Sozialdemokrat despite the fact that receipt of his subscription was acknowledged in the paper.
Is this an isolated misfortune or general one? Please look into it.

I can't get hold of any socialist poems specifically by Weerth.
There are some in Moses Hess' old Gesellschaftsspiegel of 1845, but I believe you have already seen those.
I once heard something about a collection of his verse but have never set eyes on it.

The archivist will have to wait; I haven't the time to get my own things in order.
If I do get round to it, you may be sure he won't be overlooked.
261 But now the prime consideration is the completion of the 2nd volume of Capital.
The thing's going swimmingly, the pre­ liminary edition of about 1/3 having been done, and is progressing by something like l/2 a printed sheet a day, or a little under.
As soon as we get to the last part ('The Circulation of the Aggregate Social Ca­ pital'), 3 Eisengarten can, with my help, copy out the existing ms.

In this way we shall finish before so very long, and then go on to the 3rd, most important book.
Only then will it be possible to consider putting the old pre-'48 mss.

So you, too, have finally come round to the view that we shall end up by coping quite successfully with the 'Wise Men'.

I have no doubt that it is no less excellent than its predecessors.
I shall suggest to our friends that they translate them into German and publish them in the same way as you are doing in Paris; it's precisely what we need for propaganda just now.
Would you be so kind as to pass on the enclosed note to Lafargue without Mme Lafargue's knowledge? He'll tell you the reason for this — perfectly innocent, by the way.

The matter of Dietz is becoming a bore.

two things that are to be had simulta­ neously only in Switzerland.
Printing in Austria should be considered only in case of need; 1) it would mean fresh delays and negotiations and 2) the thing would be banned all the same, you need be under no illusions as to thatb; and 3) not only could it be banned in Aus­ tria, but also seized (remember the Viennese affair you told me about last autumn).
So do get something positive done at last.
There must still be something peculiar going on in the Neue £eit, otherwise that wise man Schippel would certainly not have been allowed to talk of a 'Rodbertusian-Marxian theory', or of things that 'one has come to recognise since Rodbertus'; and without editorial com­ ment at that.
0 The Germans must have fallen low indeed if they have still not discovered that what Marx has in common with Rodbertus is nothing more than the application égalitaire de la théorie ricardienne d mentioned by Marx on p.
49 of the Poverty0 and which has been a commonplace among English socialists since 1827! But that is very far from being surplus value as defined by Marx and applied by him to every aspect of the science of economics.
Which is why the good English, and likewise Rodbertus, for all their borrowings from Ricardo, have made no headway at all in the matter of economics; the first advance in this field was made by Marx, who demolished all previous political economy.
Incidentally, if I am to tackle Rodbertus properly, I must have his piece of 1842,f Zur Erkenntniss unsrer Zustände, or whatever it is called.

I agree to your proposals, provided the thing now goes ahead.
If our workers can read Roman just as easily as German characters, I would myself, of course, prefer Roman.
Format about the same as Entwicklung" — Bebel's Frau 13B was too large.
If you believe you can sell 5,000,1 am quite agreeable.
So just get on with it and let me have the proofs soon.
The arrangement with Schabelitz is also quite satis­ factory.
264 So the only reward we get for the consideration we have shown Dietz is his regarding us all as his enemies! That the Neue £eit is to cease publication 2 6 5 is no misfortune for the party.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the great majority of li­ terary party men in Germany belong to the ranks of those opportunists and pussy-footers whom the Anti-Socialist Law,37 adversely though it may affect their pockets, has placed in exactly the right literary at­ mosphere; they can express themselves uninhibitedly, whereas we are prevented from giving them a piece of our mind.
Thus the very fact of having to fill up such a review every month demands considerable forbearance, and entails the gradual encroachment of philanthropy, humanism, sentimentality — in short all the anti-revolutionary vices a F.

People who re­ fuse on principle to learn anything and who turn out nothing but lite­ rature about literature and à propos of literature ( 9/10 of all German writing today consists of writing about other writing) will, needless to say, produce more sheets per year than those who mug up a subject and attempt to write about other books only when 1 ) they have mas­ tered those other books, 2) the latter contain anything that is worth­ while.
The preponderance of these gentlemen in literature published in Germany, a preponderance created by the Anti-Socialist Law, is un­ avoidable so long as that Law endures.
On the other hand, we have a weapon of altogether different calibre in the shape of the literature appearing abroad.
It would be delightful if you were to come to this country.
But I don't know whether you ought to count with such certainty on the New Yorkers.
Over 3 months ago Aveling was taken on as London correspondent0 and, though he has written regularly, he has not yet had a penny.
Here on the spot there's nothing to be earned.
Neither Justice nor To-Day pay, and if there's anything to be picked up else­ where in the press, everyone is on to it like a pack of wolves.
The clairvoyance in the Neue Welt 2 6 6 is the best thing that could have happened.
That sort of 'erudition' regularly degenerates into such-like nonsense.
The cruder the better — it will be over all the sooner.
I did so laugh when I got your postcard.
A few more such au­ dacious Geiseriads and the chap will have to pack his bags.
Hyndman's book,d like the man himself, is a pretentious, imperti­ nent jumble in which he, too, continually tries to pick holes in Marx (for not being an Englishman; Hyndman is the most jingoistic John Bull imaginable) and yet is so ignorant of English history that it's all wrong except for what he has learnt from the Germans.
But Hynd­ man is about to come a cropper here; true he has, with his own and Morris' money, now bought up the entire movement, financially speaking (likewise To-Day which Bax is unable to carry on for want of resources, and which has now been transferred lock, stock and barrel to Hyndman), but his eagerness to play the dictator, his envy of all potential rivals and his persistent self-promotion, have rendered him suspect to even his surest friends, and his position in the DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION" is growing shaky.

*On top of that, Justice is becoming ever sillier, and I hope that this initial phase of the movement here will very soon be over b; it is becoming dreadfully unedifying.
With your bacillum, you have given Geiser an opening 267 which, however, he may with any luck be too stupid to exploit.
Both forms, baculus and baculum, are current, hence either gender so far as the derivation is concerned.
But bacillus has long since been exclusively adopted in biology.
As I shall probably be going to the seaside for a bit at the end of this or the beginning of next month, I should be grateful if I could have Rodbertus' %ur Erkenntniss now.
c I shall return it immediately, along with the Normal-Arbeitstag, etc.
, but it is necessary for me to have seen the thing because he himself maintained in 1879 that Marx had made use of it without due acknowledgment.
187 No such accusa­ tion could ever be brought against Marx save by people without any idea of the hair-raising ignorance it requires so much as to assert any­ thing of the kind.
Anyone who has read Ricardo — and even in Adam Smith there are passages enough to this effect — must after all know what is the 'source' of surplus value without having to read the great d Rodbertus first.

8 Well, Nim and Jollymeier who came on Friday, b and myself have given this matter our most serious consideration and we have come to the unanimous, but so far not very satisfactory conclusion: that some­ thing must be wrong somewhere.
Anyhow: As La Suite" won't come, I hope you will after all come yourself and let all these considerations go to the wind.
If you wait for Paul's going to Bordeaux to start a paper, that may or may not come off these next 100 years.
If he does not go, and it is absolutely neces­ sary that you should move from 66 Boulevard de Port-Royal, well, then let him hunt for apartments and do the moving.
So I do not see what should stop you from coming over — if only for 3 weeks say — and as soon as you tell me that you are coming, we will make the road as smooth for you as we can.
Tussy and Edward are off on honeymoon No.
I, if not back already again — the grand honeymoon is to come off next Thursday.
0 Of course, Nim, Jollymeier and I have been fully aware of what was go­ ing on for a considerable time and had a good laugh at these poor in­ nocents who thought all the time we had no eyes, and who did not approach the quart d'heure de Rabelais 269 without a certain funk.
However we soon got them over that.

And that was one of the reasons why I was glad that we knew all about it — if any wise people had found it out and come up to us with the grand news, we should have been prepared.
I hope they will continue as happy as they seem now, I like Edward very much, and think it will be a good thing for him to come more into contact with other people besides the literary and lecturing circle in which he moved, he has a good foundation of solid studies, and felt himself out of place amongst that extremely superficial lot amongst whom fate had thrown him.
Jollymeier is very well and lively now — while I work he takes long walks — he is off now on one of them.
Pumps has at last got over her bronchitis, etc.
, and will move to-day into her new house in Kil-burn — beg pardon, 'West Hampstead' (I never knew Hampstead to reach as far as Edgware Road, but so it seems).
Nim is very well and lively — next week I suppose we shall have to move towards the sea, but where to? that grand question remains still to be solved.
As to myself I am right enough on condition of keeping — for the present — within very narrow bounds both as to exercise, work and enjoyment—I hope the change of air will final­ ly set me right.
And now for 7<z suite', and let it be a good one, a suite that brings you over! Paul's Blé has arrived this morning.

I, Paris, 1956 Reproduced from the original the editorial board of 97 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN IN ZURICH [London, not earlier than 25 July 1884] Dear Ede, You may send the enclosed to Auer if you wish; I have contrived it with that in view.
As regards the apportionment of constituencies,271 I assure you that I, too, have often been annoyed about it, but it is due to the de­ sire to proceed, in purely tactical matters, in accordance with general principles and this always happens at congresses where everything is made to look so nice and simple.
Dual candidatures are, of course, useless as a rule; but if you reckon that in the doubtful constituencies the best people are more likely to get in than the others and you therefore put them up there, you must either tolerate dual candida­ tures in their case or run the risk of their not being elected at all.
So if you're totally opposed to dual candidatures, you must put up the best people in the safest constituencies.
But then it is odd that this relega­ tion to doubtful constituencies never happens to Liebknecht but only to Bebel, and that e.
g.
at the last election Liebknecht had, if I am not mistaken, two quite good constituencies.
3 Enfinh such things cannot be avoided.
Nor must one forget that a battle always has its ups and downs and hence not be put out if the downs sometimes tend to pre­ dominate.
At all events, this much is certain: so long as we have the Sozialde­ mokrat, their worships the opportunists may do as they wish; and even if they gained control of the parliamentary group (which is after all only possible if Bebel is not re-elected), they wouldn't have won, not by a long chalk.
What are their intentions towards the masses? The latter keep pressing these same people onwards whether they like it or not.
And if the Wise Men 2 '9 also succeeded in gaining command of the Sozialdemokrat, this would be of shorter duration than the Sozial-demokrafs first weak-kneed period which at the outset also met with a See Engels' letter to Bernstein of 30 November 1881 (present edition, Vol.
46).
-b Well support, even among the better of the 'leaders', but was utterly re­ jected by the masses.
As to the Vast Erudition of the celebrated non-atheist,272 I shall be highly delighted if it takes every possible, opportunity to parade itself.
An equally mysterious savanta crops up in Paul de Kock's Amant de la lune; when, having gone to the utmost trouble, people finally get the measure of his erudition, they discover that it consists in a couple of conjuring tricks with corks.
Think of all the trouble we went to be­ fore this celebrated man finally consented to provide us with just a.
few samples of his erudition! And how pretty they are! And he has actually got as far as clairvoyance.

]a By way of self-sacrifice I looked through a few numbers of the Neue Welt.
It was so deadly dull that it couldn't be done for long.
As regards Mr Geiser, his 'erudition' is unassailable there.
The very fact of a person's parading his erudition in a penny paper of this kind is proof enough that he has failed to take in anything at all.
Even had he not invariably written cholera bamllus for bacillus, as though the word stemmed from bacca and not baculus.
Besides, it's to be found in any Latin dictionary.
The assertion that both materialism and ideal­ ism are one-sided and must be synthesised in a higher entity b is a hoary one and ought not to worry you; again, that atheism merely expresses a negation is an argument we ourselves had already ad­ vanced against the philosophers 40 years ago, only with the co­ rollary that atheism, as the mere negation of, and referring only to, religion, would itself be nothing without it and is thus itself another religion.
Typical of the-remaining erudition is an article by Bios on the Greek and German godsc in which alone I noted the following se­ rious bloomers: 1.
The Epistolae obscurorum virorum are said to be by Reuchlin.
While they did originate from his entourage, he had less of a hand in them than Ulrich von Hütten.

The Greek gods 'feast on nectar and quaff ambrosia'! 3^ 'Mead', alias 'Meed',d he explains in brackets, is 'beer', when every child knows that it is, and always has been, made, not with malt, but with honey.

Bios does not even know the names of the German gods; [he]e gives them now in early Nordic, now in German.
Alongside the early Nordic Odin whose German name (early Saxon Wodan, Old High German Wuotan) he doesn't know, we find the Old High German Ziu.

I do want a bit of rest, and shall have, besides this affair, plenty of transla­ tions to revise while at the seaside.
The great thing for Paul will have to be — conciseness, limitation of the question strictly to Leroy-Beaulieu's criticisms on Mohr, leaving entirely out Lassalle, etc.

However as soon as I have looked the book over I shall be able to judge better.
Anyhow as the book is big and the place for reply small, the limitation to what is strictly necessary will be unavoidable.
Now I must conclude — it's blazing hot, I have written already five letters and have still to write to 'Mrs Aveling' and to Zurich.

Eisengarten will arrange for the Sozialdemokrat to be forwarded from London.
The weather here is fine and hot and I still have to notify umpteen people of my new address.
So no further news (in any case damned scarce) save that Hyndman has now succeeded in buying To-Day as well.
Bax, who invested in it what little money he had — I warned him as early as October that it wouldn't be enough — was au bout de ses finances* at which juncture Hyndman interposed his attendant page, Champion, through whom he offered additional funds if he, Champion, became editor in place of Bax.
Thus seized by the throat, Bax accordingly resigned, the result being that Hyndman now con­ trols the whole of the so-called socialist press.
But as in the case of all such little fellows whose ambition is disproportionate to their charac­ ter and talents the moment of victory was also the moment of defeat.
Outward success is matched by failure within his own faction.
To an increasing extent Hyndman's following is coming to consist only of those he has bought outright, and/or people who are financially de­ pendent on him.
He is daily losing ground in the DEMOCRATIC FEDERA­ TION.
The day before yesterday there was a conference of dele­ gates 278; what transpired there I cannot say since Aveling, though he attended it, is at present in Derbyshire.
For he and Tussy have got married without benefit of registrar, etc.
, and are now revelling in each other's company amidst the Derbyshire hills.
Nota bene: No publicity should be given to this; it will be time enough when, per­ haps, some reactionary puts something into the papers about it.
The fact is that Aveling has a lawful wife whom he cannot get rid of de jure although he has for years been rid of her de facto.
The matter is fairly common knowledge over here, and has, on the whole, been taken well, even by literary philistines.
My London is almost a Paris in mi­ niature and it educates its people.

The examples you give do not apply to the point under discussion.
The peasant's plot which turns into ca­ pital would be land as capital, a very complex matter not discussed by Marx until the 3rd book! 0 Your slave-owner producing for the New Orleans market is no more a capitalist than the Romanian boyar who exploits forced peasant labour.
No one can be a capitalist unless he owns the means of labour and exploits the free working man! Rather you should say: the loom of the small peasant of pre-revolutionary times, which was used to weave clothing for his family, was not capital, nor yet is it capital when the peasant sells to the merchant the cloth he has been able to make during the long winter evenings; but if he employs a paid hand to weave those commodities for the merchant, and if he pockets the difference between the cost of production and the price of the sale of the cloth, then the loom is transformed into capital.

-b of Capital tal.
The production of commodities is one of the preconditions for the existence of capital; but so long as the producer sells only what he him­ self produces, he is not a capitalist; he becomes so only from the mo­ ment he makes use of his instrument to exploit the wage labour of others.
This also applies to p.
6.
How can you possibly have failed to draw that distinction? In place of your impossible slave-owner (don't be so Réachel), you might say: a feudal lord whose fields are cultivated by tenants subject to labour-rent, and who, moreover, collects tribute from them in the form of eggs, poultry, fruit, cattle, etc.
, is not a capitalist.
He lives on the surplus labour of others, but he does not transform the product of that surplus labour into surplus value; he does not sell, but consumes, spends and dissipates it.
But if the said lord, as he so frequently did in the 18th century, rids himself of some of those tenants, if he combines their plots into one big farm and rents it out to one big industrial farmer of the kind so beloved of the Physiocrats; if, in the cultivation of his farm, the said big farmer employs as wage labour those form­ erly subject to labour-rent, then agriculture is transformed from feudal into capitalist agriculture, and the farmer becomes a capitalist.
p.

The direct form taken by the circulation of commodities is, of course, its primitive form280; this clearly has to exist before the 2nd form can come into being.
Compared with simple barter it is not primi­ tive; but the circulation of commodities presupposes the existence of money; barter creates only fortuitous exchanges, not the circulation of commodities.
p.
7.
Capitalist production is not some form or other, whether di­ rect or indirect, of the circulation of commodities.
Production and circulation are two different things.
All capitalist production pre­ supposes the circulation of commodities, this being the element in which it moves, but it is not itself circulation, any more than digestion is the circulation of the blood.
You can delete the whole of that sen­ tence, which contributes nothing whatever to the sense.
p.
11.
The passage you underline, I find incomprehensible as well as wrong on all counts.
Your average capitalist does sell and can sell for more than 10 frs what is produced at a cost of 10 frs.
— Where you go wrong is over 'the costs of production'.
But the costs of production, in the sense used by economists," include profit; they con­ sist 1) of the amount the product has cost the capitalist and 2) of the a Engels is actually referring to the price of production.
profit; in other words: 1) of the amount which replaces the constant capital spent, 2) of the amount which replaces the wages paid, 3) of the surplus value, either as a whole or in part, created by the surplus labour of the wage earners.
You should therefore take Beaulieu's sen­ tence, his definition of value (p.
9, bottom), and compare the two ex­ pressions of value one with the other: either the cost price includes the profit, in which case the commodities are paid for 'in accordance with the social labour they contain'.
In which case the price (or value) in­ cludes a surplus value created by living labour, over and above the wages paid, and appropriated by the capital.
Or else the cost price does not cover the profit; in which case the value is determined, not by the social labour comprised in the object, but by the wages, whether high or low, paid for that labour — an outworn concept re­ futed at some length by Ricardo.
pp.
12 and 13.
The whole value of the machine and of the cotton, and even that of the waste, is transmitted to the product; and therein lies the true nub of your argument.
If the 115 lbs of cotton yield only 100 lbs of yarn, the pricea of the 115 lbs of raw cotton is added to the value of those 100 lbs of yarn.
Perhaps it is this, the value of the 15 lbs which have disappeared qua material but have reappeared qua value, that Mr Beaulieu calls surplus value? p.
13.
If the capitalist were to lend his machinery, etc.
, to the work­ man, the product would belong to the latter — which is never the case.
pp.
13 and 14, 'engenders a gain called profit': cf.
para.
1, p.
270, where Mr Beaulieu demonstrates that it is not the capitalist but rather the consumer who is the beneficiary of technical progress.
He criticises Marx for forgetting competition; yet all through the chapter on manufacture and big industry, Marx demonstrates that machin­ ery merely helps to lower the price of the products, and that it is com­ petition which accentuates that effect b; in other words, the gain con­ sists in manufacturing a greater number of products in the same length of time, so that the amount of work involved in each is corres­ pondingly less and the value of each proportionately lower.
Mr Beau­ lieu forgets to tell us in what respect the wage earner benefits from seeing his productivity increase when the product of that increased " In this context Marx uses 'value', not 'price' (Capital, Vol.
I, Part III, Ch, VIII, present edition, Vol.
35).
-b See K.
Marx, Capital, Vol.
I, Part IV, Ch.
XV (present edition, Vol.
35).
productivity does not belong to him, and when his wage is not deter­ mined by the productivity of the instrument.
pp.
14 and 15.
The justification of profit here proffered by Beaulieu contains what is the quintessence of vulgar economics, namely its justification of the exploitation of the working man by the capitalist.
The creator of capital demands his 'due' return for that creation (that is to say, the 'wages of abstinence' — see Marx 3), and that return has to be paid by the exploited working man in the form of unpaid la­ bour.
This you commend on the grounds that 'profit is the legitimate offspring of living labour'! 'The managerial salary' is represented and assessed in terms of the salary paid to a salaried manager, a salary with which no capitalist would rest content.
Cf.
Capital, 3rd German edition, pp.
171 and 172 (the French edition is not to hand), where you will find all these statements refuted in a few words.
b The insur­ ance premium against 'risk' is indeed taken out of surplus value, but it is reckoned over and above the profit; every year the capitalist sets aside a sum amounting to .
.
.
as a reserve for what he calls the 'ducroire' c (from the Italian del credere, that is, to cover himself against bad faith or bad debts).
Finally, rewards for greater efficiency, for inventions not yet gene­ rally exploited, occur only in exceptional cases and may then yield an extra profit; but here we are concerned with ordinary, average profit such as is common to all industrialists.
Come to that, you will find this type of profit discussed in Capital, 3rd German edition, pp.
314-17.
d By taking these statements of Beaulieu's in earnest, by declaring that profit thereby becomes 'the legitimate offspring of living labour' (not of the working man, but of the labour of the capitalist^, you endorse, on Marx's behalf and in Marx's name, those doctrines of vulgar eco­ nomics which he combatted always and everywhere.
You must, therefore, completely change your mode of expression so as to exclude even the semblance of such a meaning.
Otherwise it will be you who falls into the trap.
Your assertion on p.
16 that 'when the products .
.
.
capitalist profit is nil or all but nil', runs completely contrary to the facts.
For in that case, where is the exploitation of the workers? What are you com­ plaining about? And what do the capitalists live and grow fat on, or dissipate? Where the deuce did you light on such an idea, never ex­ pounded even by vulgar economists and which, furthermore, is not a Ibid.

even to be found in Beaulieu? And you call it a general law! What is true is that, with machines making 100 metres of cloth with the same expenditure of labour as manual labour on its own would require for 1 metre, the capitalist can spread his profit over 100 metres instead of concentrating it on only one; the result being that, while every metre carries only '/IOO of the profit, the profit on the sum total of labour expended may stay the same, if not actually increase.
p.

Marx would protest against 'the political and social ideal' at­ tributed to him by you.
When one is an economist, 'a man of science', one does not have an ideal, one elaborates scientific results, and when one is, to boot, a party man, one struggles to put them into practice.
But when one has an ideal, one cannot be a man of science, having, as one then does, preconceived ideas.
In short, the article will have an effect if you eliminate the chief er­ rors I have indicated.
But for the purpose of your riposte,281 which must be of a far more serious nature, I am firmly of the opinion that you must seriously re-read Capital, from cover to cover, with Beau-lieu's book beside you; and that you should mark all the passages re­ lating to vulgar economics.
I say Capital rather than Deville's booka which would be wholly inadequate because of grave defects in the de­ scriptive section.
Again, you must not forget that these gentry, Beaulieu and others, are far better versed than you are in the ordinary literature of eco­ nomics, and that this is a field in which you will not be able to combat them on equal terms; it is their business to know such things, not yours.
So do not venture too far into that field.
I have spoken frankly and hope you will not take it amiss.
It is too serious a matter and, if you were to put a foot wrong, the whole party would suffer as a result.

107 ENGELS TO GEORG HEINRICH VON VOLLMAR IN MUNICH Worthing, England, 13 August 1884 48 Marine Parade Dear Comrade, It was not till yesterday that your esteemed letter was sent on to me from London, hence my delay in replying.
The question you put to me 282 is difficult, or rather only to be an­ swered in the negative.
No science is so botched today as economics, and this at every university in the world.
Not only is there no one anywhere who expounds the old classical economics along the lines of Ricardo and his school; it would actually be difficult to find any one who expounded common-or-garden free trade, i.
e.
so-called Man-chesterism à la Bastiat, 283 in unadulterated form.
In England and America, as in France and Germany, the pressure of the proletarian movement caused bourgeois economists, almost without exception, to acquire an armchair-socialist cum philanthropic complexion,54 while an uncritical, benevolent eclecticism is everywhere in evidence — a soft, elastic, gelatinous substance that can be compressed into any de­ sired shape and, for that very reason, exudes an excellent nutrient fluid for the culture of careerists just as does real gelatine for the cul­ ture of bacteria.
The effect of this insubstantial, enervating, intellec­ tual pap has made itself felt in Germany, at any rate, as also here and there among German Americans, even within the very confines of our party, while on the periphery it luxuriates unchecked.
Such being the case, I would find it difficult to discover any appre­ ciable difference between the various universities.
Independent and thoroughgoing study of classical economics, from the Physiocrats and Smith to Ricardo and his school, as also of the Utopians Saint-Simon, Fourier and Owen and, finally, of Marx, combined with the constant use of one's own judgment, would probably yield the best results.
I am assuming that your friend would study the actual sources and not let herself be led astray by text-books and other secondary sources.
In Capital Marx has indicated the most important sources of informa­ tion on actual economic conditions.
How the official statistics of the various countries should be evaluated, and to what extent they are or are not useful, can best be learnt from an actual study and comparison of them.
And in just the same way, one's individual stu­ dies, the more advanced they become, provide the best guidance as to the ways and means of learning more, always supposing one has started off with genuinely classical texts and not with the most worth­ less of all — German economic text-books and/or the lectures of their authors.
That is about all I can say on the subject.
And I shall be delighted if Miss Kjellberg finds anything here that can be of use to her.

' '8 The manuscript I have here has now been revised.
Apart from slight misinterpretations of those niceties of French that can only be properly learnt in France itself, there was not much to al­ ter.
For rapports* I usually put Verhältnis rather than 'Beziehungen* because the latter is too indefinite and also because Marx always ren­ dered the German Verhältnis as rapport and vice versa.
Moreover in rapport de proportionnalité, for instance, rapport, being quantitative, can only be rendered as Verhältnis, since Beziehung has primarily a qualitative meaning.
I must make a few more notes on this subject.
I await your next manuscript.

187 In Capital I must assume an air of dignity, whereas in the preface to the Poverty I shall be more at liberty to speak my mind.
If you leave Zurich, you would certainly do better to come here rather than go anywhere else, with the possible exception of Paris.
Obviously the material aspect enters into it since you, having.
been duly installed as a married man, can no longer afford to take the risks a bachelor would.
Besides, Paris is said to be just as expensive a place to live in as here.
And for study the BRITISH MUSEUM is, after all, in­ comparably better; the Paris library cannot hold a candle to it so far as people like us are concerned, partly because of the difficulty of us­ ing the place, shortage of catalogues, etc.

As to what you want to do in regard to my pamphlet, you are bound to be a better judge than I; so do what you think appropri­ ate.
285 However I'm prepared to bet that the thing will be banned.
Like Ede, I believe that in regard to Bebel you have allowed your­ self to be much too much influenced by first impressions.
True, his last letter also evinced a certain lassitude and a desire to rest.
If there is no other way he ought to be allowed to do so for a time; but would he be able to, even if he were temporarily to absent himself from the Reichstag? This much is certain: he is irreplaceable in Germany and must be kept going, must, if necessary, spare himself, so as to be fit for action at the crucial moment.
It also seems to me that you are too censorious about the people in Germany — i.
e.
the masses.
Since time immemorial, progress has been damned slow in the case of the new blood; most of them were à la Geiser and Viereck.
That the Anti-Socialist Law 37 does more harm than good in this case in certainly not in doubt.

e.
as the authority for and/or discoverer of a trifle.
The Briefe h may, it is true, have contributed to the Rodbertus cult.
But what has done so more than anything else is, firstly, the desire among non-communists to set alongside Marx a rival who is himself a non-communist and, secondly, those people's unscientific confusion.

A shop be­ longing to a Salvation Army fanatic was attacked and broken up; the man fired his revolver, wounding three people.
Next day windows were smashed in the lock-up; that same evening 40 dragoons and 50 police moved in (the little place has about 10,000 inhabitants) to clear the streets, whereupon the good citizens, knowing themselves to be innocuous, refused to budge and in several instances received a merciless beating; now all is calm.

Nor is there any particular hurry about this.
Our prime concern must be to put Capital into English, and that will give us work and to spare.
I was greatly tickled by the way you took Bahr and Fabian, not to mention friend Gumbel, to task over the stock exchange taxes 289 (I always know my Gumbel, whether he's vindicating his respectable toping companions, the Heilbronn philistines, or whatever).
In Bahr and Fabian you have two fine examples of German 'erudition', some­ thing I am always glad to see harshly taken to task.
One aims at Bahr the blow intended for Geiser.
What particularly pleased me, how­ ever, was the way you struck home, putting emphasis on essential points, and also your verve.
Now I must break off; I can only spend a short time sitting at my desk.
I took some cold sea-baths that did me more harm than good.
Till tomorrow then.

I returned the ms.
of Poverty ' '8 to you last week, 4 September, by registered post, together with my comments.
I pre­ sume you received it.
When you [and Kautsky] compare my amend­ ments with the original you will find that certain turns of speech had not, in fact, been correctly understood (in some cases I have made comments), but that is inevitable unless one has spent a good deal of time in the country concerned.
I have at last been able to get hold of a copy of my enlarged photo­ graph for the artiste—I forget his name and have mislaid his letter — a Clearly The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.

a I shall send it to you to­ morrow or the day after.
Since the present elections will have a major impact194 we must all make an effort and so I am sending you herewith a money order for £25 for the election fund.
Sorge has sent me Gronlund's The Cooperative Commonwealth; his ex­ posé of theory rather flat after Marx's, but comprehensible to philis-tines; the main object is, apparently, to present his model of the future as true GERMAN SOCIALISM, but I found it too boring to read.
Marx is not quoted, the only reference to him being SUCH NOBLE JEWS AS MARX AND LASSALLEI Crikey! Under Hyndman's direction To-Day gets worse and worse.
To make it more interesting they accept anything and everything.
The editor has written to me saying that the October issue will contain a critique of Capital\\,h and invites me to reply — which I refused with thanks.
290 Thus a socialist organ has turned into an organ in which the pros and cons of socialism are discussed by every Tom, Dick and Harry.
I am sending you a Kölnische from which you may see what methods are used in Africa even by Stanley-Leopold of Belgium's humane, civilising Association Internationale.
291 Then what may we not expect of the Portuguese and French,— not to speak of our flog 'em-and-shoot 'em Prussians — when they get going? Come to that, Bismarck has pulled off a thundering good electoral coup with that colonial racket of his.

193 113 ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY > IN ZURICH London, 20 September 1884 Dear Kautsky, I return the mss.
293 herewith by registered post.
Your article on Rodbertus was very good in regard to economics; what I would take issue with here again are your apodictic assertions in fields where, as you yourself know, you are not on firm ground, and in which you also lay yourself open to attack by Schramm who has been astute enough to seize on that opportunity.
This applies particularly to 'abstraction' which you undoubtedly come down on far too heavily in a general way.
The distinction here is as follows: Marx reduces the common content shared by things and circum­ stances to the most general conceptual expression, hence his abstrac­ tion merely reproduces in conceptual form the content already inhe­ rent in things.
Rodbertus, on the other hand, concocts what is a more or less im­ perfect conceptual expression and measures things against that con­ cept to which they must conform.
He is looking for the true, eternal content of things and of social conditions of which, however, the con­ tent is essentially transient.
Hence true capital.
This is not capital as it is today, which is only an imperfect realisation of the concept.
Instead of deducing the concept of capital from capital as it is today — the only sort, after all, that really does exist — he seeks to arrive at true capital from present-day capital by the device of taking an isolated individual, and asking what might figure as capital in that indivi­ dual's production.
Namely, the simple means of production.
In this way true capital is simply lumped together with the means of produc­ tion which, depending on circumstances, is or is not capital.
In this way all the bad properties of capital, namely all the real properties, are eliminated therefrom.
He can now demand that real capital should conform to this concept, i.
e.
merely continue to function as a simple, social means of production, discard everything that makes it capital, and yet remain capital, indeed become true capital precisely as a result of this.
You do the same kind of thing in the case of value.
Present value is that of the production of commodities, but with the suppression of the production of commodities, value 'changes' or rather, value as such remains and merely changes its form.
But in fact economic value is a category that appertains to the production of commodities, disappearing with it (cf.
Dühring, pp.
252-62 a), just as it did not exist before it.
The relation of labour to product prior to and after pro­ duction of commodities no longer expresses itself in the form of value.
Fortunately Schramm is also a bit shaky in the matter of philos­ ophy, and lays himself open to attack, as you have perfectly well ap­ prehended and demonstrated.
Further: 1) Schramm recognises material interests that do not derive — either directly or indirectly — from the mode of production.
On this, cf.
Marx, A Contribution to the Critique, preface, 15 where the matter is presented concisely and cogently in 20 lines.
2) Long before Rodbertus, the English and French Utopians had criticised existing society just as well as, if not better than, he, as had the post-Ricardian school of socialist economists on the basis of Ricardo's theory of value; Marx cites some of these in the Poverty, pp.
49 and 50.
c 3) The Robinson mentioned by Marxd is Daniel Defoe's genuine, original Robinson Crusoe, whence the attendant circumstances—the objects salvaged from the shipwreck, etc.
— are also taken.
Later on he, too, has his Freitag (FRIDAY); he was also a shipwrecked merchant who, unless I am mistaken, likewise engaged from time to time in the slave trade.
A proper 'bourgeois], therefore.
4) To talk of the Marxian school of history was certainly most pre­ mature.
I should curtail that part of your reply and refer primarily to Marx himself,— the above-mentioned passage from A Contribution to the Critique, and also Capital itself, in particular primitive accumula-a F.

Should they contain no mistakes to speak of, a list of print­ ing errors will not be necessary.
Rodbertus' Erkenntniss etc.

20 marks.
I should be glad to buy a copy at this price, if not less.
There does exist a French speech by Marx on the subject of free trade0 but none, so far as I am aware, on protective tariffs.
It would hardly be suitable for translation as a book on its own, but if Ede wishes to use it as an appendix to the German Poverty,118 it wouldn't be a bad idea and I could send my copy.

until today.
But since the begin­ ning of June I have been able to sit at my desk and write only at the cost of some pain and in defiance of doctor's orders.
For almost 18 months now, my movements have been hampered by a peculiar ail­ ment which somewhat mystifies the doctors; I have had to abandon completely my old way of life, which entailed much movement, and have, in particular, been prevented from writing.
Only for the past 10 days or so have I been enabled by mechanical appliances to move about with a certain amount of freedom and I believe that, once these appliances have been properly adjusted, I shall be more or less my old self again; apart from the discomfort I have suffered, the thing is of no great significance and will, I hope, gradually disappear altogether.
However, if I could not write, I could at least dictate — I dictated the whole of the 2nd book of Capital from the ms.
, and practically got a society -b conditions of existence -c outright -d See previous letter.
it ready for the press, as well as revised the first 3/8 of the English translation3 and have, besides, perused all kinds of other things, so that I have got through quite a fair amount of work.
At the same time as this, you will be getting a copy of my newly published workb; I shall make sure it goes off.
All day my head has been full of electoral agitation.
194 Our great triennial trial is an event of European significance by comparison with which the anxious journeyings of no matter how many empe­ rors 297 are as nothing.
I well remember how thunderstruck Europe was in 1875 by our people's electoral victories298 and how Bakuninist anarchism was banished from the scene in Italy, France, Switzerland and Spain.
And just now another such result is urgently required.
In Europe, at any rate, those caricatures of anarchists à la Most, who have already sunk from the level of a Rinaldo Rinaldini to and below that of a Schinderhannes c if not lower, would in their turn — at least so far as Europe was concerned — succumb to a similar knock-out blow, and thus save us a deal of toil and trouble.
In America, where sects continue to proliferate, these could then simply be allowed to die off gradually; after all, did not Karl Heinzen manage to remain alive there for 25 years after he was dead and buried in Europe?d The French in the provinces, who are forging ahead most manfully, would be considerably encouraged and the Parisian masses be given a further impulse towards emancipating themselves from their posi­ tion as appendage of the extreme Left.
Here in England, where the Reform Bill has given new power to the workers,299 the impulse would come just in time for the next elections in 1885 and might pro­ vide the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION 3 ° °—which merely consists on the one hand of literati, on the other of the remnants of old sects and, thirdly, of a sentimental public — with the opportunity of becoming a real party.
In America, it only requires an event of this kind to make the English-speaking workers at last realise what power is theirs if they choose to make use of it.
And in Italy and Spain it would deal a fresh blow to the doctrinaire anarchist rhetoric which still continues to flourish there.
In short, the victories you achieve will take effect, from Siberia to California, and from Sicily to Sweden.
But how will the new 'parliamentary group' turn out? Many of the new prospective candidates are quite unknown to me and what a of the first volume of Capital (see Note 56)-b The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State-c Johann Bückler-d Cf.
this volume, p.
114.
199 I know of the majority of 'educated' ones is not altogether to their credit.
The Anti-Socialist Law3 ' makes it all too easy for bourgeois and bourgeois-inspired socialists to satisfy the electorate and to in­ dulge their own urge for self-advancement.
Not that it isn't perfectly in order for such men to be put up and elected in comparatively backward constituencies.
But they are likewise invading the old con­ stituencies, which deserve better representatives, and in this they are supported by people who ought to know better.
I am not at all sure how the new parliamentary group will turn out, and still less what it will do.
The division into proletarian and bourgeois camps is becom­ ing ever more pronounced and, once the bourgeois elements have plucked up the courage to outvote the proletarian, a breach might be provoked.
This is a possibility which should, I think, be kept in view.
If they provoke the breach — something that will call for a bit more Dutch courage — it won't be too bad.
I am still of the opinion that, so long as the Anti-Socialist Law continues in force, the breach should not be provoked by us; but if it does come, then you should go to with a will, in which case I shall also put my shoulder to the wheel.
I am glad to hear that the colonial racket is not proving attrac­ tive.
292 It is the best card Bismarck has played, nicely calculated to appeal to the philistine and replete, not only with illusory hopes but also with horrendously heavy costs, which will be recovered only by degrees.
Bismarck and his colonies remind me of the crazy (really idiotic) last Duke of Bernburg" who remarked in the early forties: I am going to have a railway, even if it costs me a thousand talers.
What 1,000 talers are to the cost of a railway, so the colonial budget adumbrated by Bismarck and his fellow-philistines is to the actual costs involved.
For in this case I consider Bismarck fool enough to be­ lieve that Lüderitz and Woermann would bear the costs.
Apropos Bismarck.
At a conference of engineers, a friend of ours met Bismarck's partner in the Varziner Paper Mill (Behrens), and from him learned a good deal about Bismarck's uncouth behaviour.
A true Prussian Junker, on rare occasions and by a painful effort ca­ pable of good manners at most in the drawing-room, but who other­ wise allows his brutality free rein.
You know all about that, however.
Having asked a factory inspector what his salary was and learned that it was 1,000 talers, he remarked: 'In that case you are dependent on bribes.
' But the really interesting thing was Bismarck's telling the afore-mentioned Behrens that the only speaker in the Reichstag Alexander Karl worthy of the name, and one to whom everyone always listened, was August Bebel.
The more often you write and tell me about the situation in Ger­ many, and in particular about industrial developments, the better pleased I am.
If I do not always reply in detail it is because, in this in­ stance, I am merely your pupil — the more gladly in that the only in­ formation I can regard as wholly reliable is that provided by you.
On the whole, German industry remains what it has always been: it man­ ufactures those articles which the British consider too insignificant, and the French too common, but does so on a very large scale; Ger­ man industry still depends for its subsistence on 1 ) the theft of pat­ terns from abroad and 2) the free gift of ordinary surplus value to the purchasers, whereby it is alone enabled to compete, and the exaction of inordinate surplus value by forcing down wages, which alone en­ ables it to exist.
This means, however, that while the struggle between worker and capitalist may stagnate in some places (where abnormal wages have already become the norm), in most it is growing more acute by reason of ever-rising pressure.
At all events, 1848 marked the beginning of an industrial revolution in Germany which will yet give the worthy bourgeois pause for thought.
Goodbye for now.

What is unusual is that his great oratorical talents — all the philistines recognise these and do so readily, while Bismarck told Behrens, a partner in his paper mill, that Bebel was the only orator in the whole of the Reichstag — have not trivialised him in any way.
" Nothing of the kind has happened since Demosthenes.
All other orators have been shallow-pated.
Don't worry about my health; it is a localised and sometimes troublesome complaint but there are no general after-effects what­ ever and it is not even necessarily incurable; at worst it renders me unfit for active service though I may be able to mount a horse again in a few years' time.
Having been incapable of writing for the past 4 months I have dictated instead, and am now pretty well done with the 2nd book of Capital; have also gone through the English transla­ tion (as far as it has got — about 3/8ths of the whole) of the 1st book.
56 Moreover I have now discovered a device which is helping me to get more or less back on my feet again and I hope to make still further progress before long.
Rather, my misfortune is that since we lost Marx I have been supposed to represent him.
I have spent a lifetime doing what I was fitted for, namely playing second fiddle, and indeed I believe I acquitted myself reasonably well.
And I was happy to have so splendid a first fiddle as Marx.
But now that I am suddenly expected to take Marx's place in matters of theory and play first fid­ dle, there will inevitably be blunders and no one is more aware ofthat than I.
And not until the times get somewhat more turbulent shall we really be aware of what we have lost in Marx.
Not one of us possesses the breadth of vision that enabled him, at the very moment when ra­ pid action was called for, invariably to hit upon the right solution and at once get to the heart of the matter.
In more peaceful times it could happen that events proved me right and him wrong, but at a revolu­ tionary juncture his judgment was virtually infallible.

Engels, 'Marx and Rodbertus' So Geiser is the inventor of this marvellous spelling! Another feather in his cap.
I must confess that my aversion to this procrustean bed was to some extent responsible for my failing to get a move on with contributions to the Neue Zeit.
But do tell me whether this splen­ did system was obligatory in the case of other books published by Dietz — in that of Bebel's Frau' 38 it was not; it is important that I should know this in the event of my replying to Dietz.
Having protested to Dietz 39 about Geiserianism so categorically, I cannot now submit to it in the Neue Z e^—nor yet where the print­ ing of the preface is concerned.
Elsewhere I have no objections, of course.
For Ede: Wehner writes to say that the person did not demand the money on behalf of our people, he having sent it of his own free will; however the said person says that they had accepted it.
This amounts to the same thing.
I have not read Rodbertus' Creditnotha either; however it can only contain what we know already, namely that mortgages are not re­ deemable, not repayable in capital, but merely intended to establish a claim to 'rent', i.
e.
regular payments of interest; if these payments are not forthcoming, an order may be made for the sale of the prop­ erty; the mortgagee has no further claim.
This is Rodbertus' 'princi­ ple of rent', intended to enable the Junkers to produce, bourgeois-fashion, 5,000 talers per annum and expend, aristo-fashion, 10,000 talers and still not ruin themselves.
How it's done remains a mystery.
I had to laugh when I saw Schramm trying to find something signific­ ant in it.

You will be able to help him there of course.
As swarthy as any southern European might be, not much red about the cheeks (when you saw Marx he was already a very sickly yellow; that wasn't normal), moustache jet black, streaked with white but without a trace of brown; save for grizzled hairs, hair and beard snow white.
The picture — a retouched photographic en­ largement— is a speaking likeness, and he will get it per the Swiss post office.

303 Everyone is astonished that the Prussians should have appointed and paid (?) such a clumsy brute.
Joynes of To-Day has just been to see me.
They have been wanting for some time to publish an English version of the Entwicklung, 3 the rights to translate which I had long since conceded to Aveling.
b They don't want him, however, he and Hyndman being + c rivals, and tried to insist upon my accepting Shaw, who does not know German and proposes to translate from the French.
This I took the liberty of declining and referred him to Aveling whom, in any case, I like better every day.
These little literary intrigues make up the greater part of the internal history of the movement in this country.
Nor is this their only trouble.
A week ago last Tuesdayd Mme Lafargue attended a meeting of the COUNCIL of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION 300 dur­ ing which they were bickering about some trifle or other to such good purpose that the air was buzzing with cries of DAMNED LIAR.
Great fun, it seems.
The only men in whom I have any confidence are Bax and Aveling, both thoroughly good chaps, intelligent and sincere, but in need of a great deal of help.
I don't give much for the others, in so far as I have had the opportunity to judge them.
I have now also got Mr Mommsen just where I want him.
In his Römische Forschungen he wrote a lot of nonsense about enuptio gentis e; I went into the matter and have now extracted all the relevant pas­ sages/ If anyone of the Mommsen school should try to fault me in regard to Roman history (quite possible in regard to form, but not substance), I shall be able to oblige.
Hirsch has sent me the Frankfurter Leitung with a feuilleton on Lip-pert's Geschichte der Familie? The book is obviously barefaced plagiar­ ism from Morgan and Bachofen, with a few trimmings from other easily discoverable sources.
Warmest regards to Ede.

Published in English tor the farst time 124 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 305 IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN London, 29 October 1884 Dear Bebel, Your telegram arrived here a minute or two after six and was hailed with cries of delight.
306 I at once sent off postcards to people here and in the provinces to make its contents known and also advised Paris39 where the first news they hear of anything is inva­ riably garbled and contradictory.
Very many thanks for sparing me a thought in the midst of the electoral hurly-burly.
I have also informed 3 9 the Society.
'6 2 It is more than I expected.
I am less concerned just now with the number of seats that will eventually be won; the obligatory fifteen are assured307 and the main thing is the proof that the movement is marching ahead at a pace that is as rapid as it is sure, that consti­ tuency after constituency has been carried away by it and has ceased to be a safe seat for the other parties.
But what is also splendid is the way our workers have run the affair, the tenacity, determination and, above all, humour with which they have captured position after posi­ tion and set at naught all the dodges, threats and bullying on the part of government and bourgeoisie.
What Germany could damned well 211 do with is reinstatement in the world's esteem; Bismarck and Moltke can make her feared; respect, genuine esteem, such as is only accord­ ed to free, self-disciplined men — that respect will only be exacted by our proletarians.
The effect on Europe and America will be enormous.
I have hopes that in France it will provide fresh impetus for our party.
Over there people are still suffering from the aftermath of the Commune.
Great though its influence on Europe may have been, it has also seriously set back the French proletariat.
To have been in power for three months — and in Paris at that — and not to have radically altered the world but rather have come to grief through their own incompetence (such being the biassed fashion in which the matter is understood to­ day) — is proof that the party is not viable.
That is the specious argu­ ment usually advanced by people who fail to realise that, while the Commune was the grave of early specifically French socialism, it was, for France, also and at the same time the cradle of a new interna­ tional communism.
And this last will be duly set on its feet by the German victories.
Mme Lafargue, who is here and sends you her warm regards, is also of this opinion.
Similarly the news will make a strong impact on the English-speaking proletariat in America.
You will have received my registered letter39 as also my post­ card '"of the day before yesterday.
My main worry just now is whether you yourself have pulled it off in your doubtful constituencies.
308 In view of the many new elements who are in any case joining the parliamentary group, it is precisely at the beginning that you are so urgently needed, lest you find yourself subsequently presented with, faits accomplis in which you had no part.
I also know you are not in the best of health and you must at all costs conserve yourself for the party and the more critical times that lie ahead of it.
But no doubt everything will work out satisfactorily.
I wanted to tell you more about the Rodbertus business, but it's no longer possible this evening.
As for Schramm himself, he will already have had an adequate dressing-down from Karl Kautsky.
a In the preface to the Poverty" 01 have already clarified Rodbertus' attitude to­ wards us and this will, I think, suffice until I am able to deal with him more thoroughly in the preface to Capital, Book II.

e.
five years — have supervened.
309 So I shall revert to it only briefly.
Herewith Liebknecht's letter — typical.
Why you should not be able to edit the Neue £eit just as well from London as from Zurich is in­ conceivable.
Equally so, why your being in London should mean that you'll be lost to the German party.
However, this letter provides no proof that Liebknecht — under the influence of different surround­ ings and a different frame of mind — might not very soon think and write quite differently.
The fact that he was only partially successful at Offenbach — we over here don't yet know the results of the second ballot — may have given him reason to pause.
310 The bit about the 'impregnable' position in Stukkert" is killing.
Like the NCO in the French revolutionary army telling his bare-footed squad about the speech made by the people's representative: Le représentant a dit: Avec du fer et du pain on va jusqu'en Chine.
Il n'a pas parlé de chaussures} Impregnable — if there were no police! I am writing to Dietz 39 telling him to send me the proofs of the prefacec in galley form since a number of alterations will be neces-a A reference to the editorial offices of Die Neue £eit in Stuttgart.

213 sary.
With this sort of thing, one cannot be too careful about one's mode of expression if one is not to find oneself pinned down to some ill-chosen or ambiguous word.
The elections will elicit an echo throughout Europe and America.
And what a triumphant day it was! The Kölnische concedes us 3/4 of a million votes and, in the hope of obtaining their support in the sec­ ond ballot, is grovelling before the 4,000 who voted for Bebel in Cologne.
3 ' ' To me the Kölnische is more important than any other paper because the Rhenish bourgeois are still the most advanced bour­ geois in Germany and the Kölnische is their mirror.
And hence this complete volte-face, this sudden respect for a new power, is all the more significant.
But how truly splendid it is! For the first time in history a strong, coherent workers' party exists as a real political power, evolved and come of age amidst the harshest persecution, irresistibly capturing one position after another, free of all philistinism in the most philis-tine, free of all chauvinism in the most cock-a-hoop country in Europe.
A power the existence and rise of which is as incomprehensible and mysterious to governments and the old ruling classes as was the rising tide of Christianity to the authorities of the declining Roman Empire, but which is working its way to the fore as certainly and in­ exorably as once Christianity — so certainly that the rate at which its velocity will increase, and hence the actual time of its ultimate vic­ tory, already permits of mathematical calculation.
Helped on its way rather than suppressed by the Anti-Socialist Law,37 it deigns only to spurn Bismarck's social reform 3 '2 and the last desperate measure to suppress it momentarily — by fomenting a premature coup — would elicit nothing but immortal laughter.
It's strange.
The best aid to our progress is precisely the backward­ ness of Germany's industrial position.
In England and France the transition to large-scale industry is pretty well complete.
The condi­ tions in which the proletariat now finds itself have already become stable; agricultural districts and industrial districts, large-scale indus­ try and cottage industries have become separated and, as far as is in fact possible in modern industry, firmly established.
Even the fluctua­ tions inseparable from the ten-year cycle of crises have become habi­ tual conditions of existence.
The political, if not actually socialist, movements that arose during the period of industrial revolution — immature as they were — have failed, leaving behind them discourage­ ment rather than encouragement.
Bourgeois capitalist develop-ment has proved stronger than revolutionary counter-pressure; if there is to be another revolt against capitalist production there must be another, more powerful impulse, such as the ousting of England from the dominant position she has hitherto occupied in the world market, or some special revolutionary opportunity in France.
In Germany, on the other hand, large-scale industry goes back no further than 1848 and is the greatest legacy ofthat year.
The indus­ trial revolution is still going on, and doing so under the most unfa­ vourable conditions.
Cottage industries, based on small-, free-or lease-holdings, still continue to struggle against machinery and steam; the foundering smallholder looks to a cottage industry as his last sheet anchor, but no sooner is he industrialised than he is again subjected to pressure from machinery and steam.
Subsidiary income from the land, the domestic potato plot, provides the capitalist with the most powerful pretext for depressing wages; he can now present his foreign customers with the entire normal surplus value — the only way he can compete in the world market—the whole of his profits being derived from what he deducts from the normal wages.
Along­ side this there is the complete subversion of all living conditions in the industrial centres as a result of the enormous strides made by large-scale industry.
Thus the whole of Germany, with perhaps the exception of the Junker-dominated North-East, is becoming swept into the social revolution, the smallholder drawn into industry, and patriarchal circles being precipitated into the movement, and thus is far more fundamentally revolutionised than England or France.
This social revolution of which the eventual outcome is the expro­ priation of the smallholder and handicraftsman is, however, taking place at the very time when a German, Marx, was destined to make a theoretical analysis of the results of historical developments, both theoretical and practical, in England and France, to elucidate the whole nature of capitalist production and hence its ultimate historical fate, and thus provide the German proletariat with a programme such as the English and the French, its precursors, have never pos­ sessed.
A more fundamental revolutionising of society on the one hand, greater lucidity of intellect on the other — that is the secret of the irresistible progress made by the German workers' move­ ment.
I had meant to write to Ede as well, but it has grown too late — moreover Pumps has arrived with her little girl with whom I shall have to play.
Aveling and Tussy are arriving at 5 and at 7.
Morris wants to hold a grand consultation with me.
So for the time being Ede will have to content himself with my good wishes.

204-05 127 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN IN ZURICH London, 11 November 1884 Dear Ede, The inquiry in your letter about Marx's article on Proudhona has been dealt with in my prefaceb where I made direct reference to it.
You must now let me know how you propose to arrange the whole3 ° ' ; I may receive the proofs of the preface any day and shall proceed accordingly in regard to the above article, the excerpt from A Contribution to the Critique0 and possibly the 'Speech'.
d You did right to stress in the Sozialdemokrat'' that we are the only serious opponents of the Centre.
229 Only by penetrating the strong­ holds of the Centre — Munich, Mainz, Cologne, Aachen, Düssel­ dorf, Essen, etc.
— shall we be able to disperse this artificially united omnium-gatherum of opposing views and compel every one of them to show their true colours.
And then it will transpire that the genuine­ ly Catholic group is simply the Catholic wing of reaction, just as in Belgium and France it constitutes the whole of reaction.
And no one would suffer more from this dispersal of the Centre than Mr Bis­ marck, who can darned well do with a hotchpotch of a party like that.
I get little news of how the second ballots are going and then only belatedly.
306 I hope that at this juncture a good many will turn out well, for the more new elements there are in the parliamentary group just now the better.
The worst of them (the eddicated) have already been elected; those still to come are most of them working men and they can only improve the company.
Judgment has been passed on the Anti-Socialist Law.
37 State and bourgeoisie have been made to look fearful asses vis-à-vis ourselves.

this could be badly mistaken.
Over here old John Russell carried on as Prime Minister for 20 years after his political demise.
To abolish the Law does, after all, require a decision, and they are unlikely to make the necessary effort.
At best there would be penal clauses which would cause us heavier casualties than would the Anti-Socialist Law.
We must now put forward positive proposals in regard to legisla­ tion.
307 If they are couched emphatically, i.
e.
without regard for petty-bourgeois prejudices, then they will be very good.
But if they are Geisered and Vierecked, then they will be bad.
Normal working day (10 hours gradually reducing to perhaps 8), domestic and inter­ national factory legislation (in which the domestic could go further than the international), radical revision of the legislation affecting employers' liability, accident, sickness, disabled workmen, etc.
— these will provide enough and more to go on with.
Nous verrons* The 1884 elections are for us what those of 1866 were for the Ger­ man philistine.
Then, all of a sudden, he became a 'great nation' without having had anything to do with it and, indeed, against his will.
b Now we have become a 'great party', but by our own hard work and at the cost of heavy sacrifices.
Noblesse oblige.
We cannot bring the mass of the nation over to our side unless that mass under­ goes a gradual process of development.
Frankfurt, Munich, Königs­ berg, cannot suddenly become as pronouncedly proletarian as Saxony, Berlin, the industrial Ruhr.
Just now the petty-bourgeois ele­ ments among the leaders may find here and there among the masses the backing they have hitherto lacked.
What has hitherto been a re­ actionary tendency in the case of individuals may now reproduce it­ self as a necessary developmental element—localised — in the case of the masses.
That would call for a change of tactics if the masses are to be helped on their way without, at the same time, allowing the bad leaders to gain the ascendant.
Here again we shall have to wait and see.
Tomorrow I shall attend to the very tricky final editing of Part III of the 2nd book of Capital.
0 As soon as I have finished I hope to find time to rewrite the Peasant War2 '3 which this time will appear as a turning-point for the whole of the history of Germany and hence calls for important historical additions both at the beginning and the end.
Only the account of the actual war will remain more or less as it stands.
I feel that it is more important to print the Peasant War first rather than the Dilhring which I shall alter little, simply adding notes a We shall see.

or appendices.
What arrangements do you propose to make about the printing? Whatever becomes of the Anti-Socialist Law, the papera and the press in Zurich must, in my view, continue to operate.
They will never restore freedom to us, even of the pre-1878 variety.
Your Geisers and Vierecks will be allowed complete freedom and they in turn will trot out the pretty excuse that they went as far as they could.
But in our case, the requisite freedom of the press is only to be had abroad.
Come to that, it is even possible that attempts will be made to curtail universal suffrage; cowardliness makes people stupid and the philis-tine is capable de tout} 1 Admittedly we shall receive compliments from left, right and centre and they won't in every case fall on stony ground.
For friend Singer might feel inclined to show proof that, de­ spite or because of his paunch, he is no ogre.
Karl Kautsky will have received my letter of yesterday.

-d Emil Engels, Frederick Engels' brother your earlier letters also contained a number of allusions that gave me cause for anxiety.
If tubercles have now finally ap­ peared— not exactly common at our age — it is certainly a very bad sign, but I trust he will still be able to remain among us for a time and in a condition that does not make life too much of a burden to him.
Nevertheless one pleasure he has still been able to experience, as I saw not long ago in the paper, is the opening of the Aggertal railwaya to which he devoted so many years of incessant toil.
Even though this little branch line may be far from what he had in mind, it is nevertheless better than nothing and will bring quite a different kind of life into the valley and Engelskirchen than has been the case hitherto.
I should have written to you sooner had not Hermann'sb wedding intervened, at which time I wasn't absolutely sure where you were; since then there have been numerous interruptions and, on top of that, I have been up to my eyes in work.
Moreover, for the past 18 months I, in my own person, have been sharply reminded of the frailty of the human body.
What was actually wrong I shall probably never discover, but suffice it to say that the thing now seems to be righting itself and developing into some kind of hernial trouble (what is involved is not the prolapse of a piece of gut, but water in the abdo­ men).
Besides, I have found a very efficient bandage-maker who has treated many cases of this kind, which are pretty rare as a rule, and has constructed a highly practical but in no way uncomfortable ap­ pliance for it.
After lengthy experiments I can now manage it pretty well and am at last able to move about again and, what had hitherto proved a virtual impossibility, work at my desk.
If things carry on like this, I shall be content; apart from relaxed muscles and ligaments, which is only natural after one has lain motionless on a sofa for so long, I no longer feel anything and am gradually becoming my old self again.
I trust you are all keeping well otherwise.
Rudolf 0 would also seem to be on the mend again.
He seems to have inherited father's constitu­ tion in many respects, for he too had constant trouble with his sto­ mach until his forties but was then perfectly all right and would doubtless still be alive had not typhoid reft him away.

The rest will follow later, in the preface to Capital, Book IL d There is, however, another point about which I should like to give you my opinion, and which seems to me more urgent.
Such is the respect we have inspired in liberal philistines generally that they all exclaim with one voice: 'All right, only let the Social Democrats place themselves on a legal footing and abjure revolu­ tion— then we shall support the immediate repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law.

A tame reply would immediately destroy the tremendous impression created by the elections.
306 As I see it, the case is as follows: The political situation now obtaining throughout Europe is the re­ sult of revolutions.
Everywhere the fundamental laws, historical laws, legitimacy, have been infringed a thousand times over, if not actually subverted.
It is, however, in the nature of all parties and/or classes that have come to power by revolutionary means to demand that the fundamental laws newly created by the revolution be unconditionally recognised and held sacrosanct.
The right to revolution has existed — otherwise those who now rule would, after all, not be entitled to do so — but from now on it is to cease to exist.
In Germany the present situation is based on the revolution that began in 1848 and ended in 1866.
1866 saw a complete revolution.
Just as Prussia became what it is only by betraying and making war on the German Empire in alliance with other countries (1740, 1756, 1795 317), so, too, it was only by the forcible subversion of the Ger­ man Confederation and by civil war that it brought into being the Prusso-German Empire.
318 Its assertion that it was the others who broke the federal treaty in no way alters the fact.
The others maintain the contrary.
No revolution has ever yet lacked a pretext of legal­ ity— vide France in 1830 when Kinga and bourgeoisie each claimed to be in the right.
In short, Prussia fomented civil war and, with it, rev­ olution.
After its victory, it overthrew three thrones 'by the grace of God' and annexed their territories, together with the once free city of Frankfurt.
319 If that was not revolutionary, then I don't know what the word means.
Not content with that, it confiscated the private property of the princes it had driven out.
That this was not legal, hence revolutionary, it admitted when it induced an assembly — the Reichstag — to approve the deed in retrospect, though the said as­ sembly had no more right than the government to dispose of those funds.
320 The Prusso-German Empire, as the consummation of the North German Confederation forcibly created by the events of 1867, b 3 2 ' is a wholly revolutionary creation.
I am not complaining about that.
What I do reproach the chaps for—the ones responsible for it—is for having been no more than pusillanimous revolutionaries, for not hav-a Louis Philippe-b 1866 in the original.
ing gone much further and annexed the whole of Germany to Prussia straight away.
But anyone whose instruments are blood and iron, who overthrows monarchies, engulfs entire states and confiscates private property, should not damn other people as revolutionaries.
Should the party merely retain the right to be neither more nor less revolutionary than the imperial government has shown itself, it will have obtained all it requires.
Not long since, it was officially stated that the imperial constitution was not a compact between the princes and the people, but only a compact between the princes and the free cities for which a new one could at any time be substituted.
Thus, the government organs that expounded this were demanding for the governments the right to sub­ vert the imperial constitution.
They were not subjected to an emergency law, nor were they prosecuted.
Very well — neither do we demand for ourselves, in the most extreme case, more than is demanded for the governments in this one.
The Duke of Cumberland is the rightful, undisputed heir to the throne of Brunswick.
The King of Prussia has no more right to reign in Berlin than is claimed by Cumberland in Brunswick.
Anything else that is wanted of him can only be laid claim to after Cumberland has taken possession of his rightful, legitimate throne.
This the revolu­ tionary German imperial government is forcibly preventing him from doing.
Yet another revolutionary act.
And what is the position as regards the parties? In November 1848 the Conservative Party did not hesitate to in­ fringe the legality constituted in March of that year.
322 In any case, it accords only provisional recognition to the present consti­ tutional state of affairs and would joyfully acclaim any feudal and ab­ solutist coup d'état.
The Liberal Party of all shades participated in the revolution from 1848 to 1866, nor would it today allow anyone to deny it the right to counter the forcible subversion of the constitution with force.
The Centre 2 2 9 recognises the Church as the supreme power trans­ cending the state; a power, that is, which might, in certain circum­ stances, make revolution a duty.
And these are the parties which demand of us that we and we alone out of all the rest should declare that we would in no circumstances re­ sort to force, would submit to any pressure, any outrage, not only when these have a veneer of legality — are legal in our opponents' view — but also when they are downright illegal.
No party, unless it was lying, has ever denied the right to armed re­ sistance in certain circumstances.
None has ever been able to renounce that ultimate right.
But once the debate begins to turn on the circumstances in which a party may reserve that right, the game is already won.
The whole thing becomes progressively more nonsensical.
Particularly in the case of a party that has been declared illegal and is thus actually re­ duced by higher authority to resorting to revolution.
And such a de­ claration of illegality, having been made once already, might recur any day.
To demand an unconditional statement of this kind from such a party is utterly preposterous.
Nor, for that matter, have the gentlemen anything to worry about.
The military position being what it now is, we shall not go into action so long as we have a military power against us.
We can bide our time until that military power ceases to be a power against us.
Any revolution prior to that, even a victorious one, would bring to power, not our­ selves, but the most radical elements of the bourgeoisie and/or petty bourgeoisie.
In any case, the elections have shown that we can expect to gain nothing by submissiveness, i.
e.
concessions to our opponents.
It is only defiant resistance that has gained us their respect and turned us into a power.
Only power is respected and only so long as we remain a power will your philistine respect us.
Anyone who makes conces­ sions and is therefore no longer a power, he will despise.
You can let them feel the iron fist in the velvet glove, indeed you must.
The Ger­ man proletariat has become a powerful party — may its représenta tives be worthy of it! Your F.

Nim has suffered much from tooth-ache — a sound tooth, but loose.
Yesterday she took an old pair of small tongs which she brought from Maitland Park and wrenched it out with it, rewarding her courage with a drop of brandy, and is now quite lively again.
Friday lasta the Social Democratic Federation300 had a benefit.
Tussy and Edward played in a piece— I did not go, as I do not as yet see my way to sitting three hours consecutively in a stiff chair.
Nim says they played very well — the piece was more or less, she says, their own history.
Mother Wright read — very well — Bax played the pi­ ano— rather long — Morris who was here the other night and quite delighted to find the Old Norse Edda 3 2 3 on my table — he is an Ice­ landic enthusiast—Morris read a piece of his poetry b (a 'refonte'c of the Eddaic Helreid BrynhildarA—the description of Brynhild burn­ ing herself with Sigurd's corpse), etc.
, etc.
; it went off very well — their art seems to be rather better than their literature and their poetry better than their prose.
Paul's reply to Block is excellent, not only in style but in subject-matter.
281 People have different ways of learning things, and if he learns political economy by fighting, it's all right so that he does learn it.
He was quite right in bearing out the question of the equal price of corn which costs different amounts of labour — that is too compli­ cated and is solved only in Book III, Kapital.
But what he may re­ turn to, when he has an opportunity, is the stupid calumny of Block, page 131, note: that Mohr insiste surtout sur le capital employé dans le commerce, tant sous la forme argent (espèces) que sous la forme mar-a 21 November -b W.

* This is a direct lie or a proof that he does not know what he is writing about.
Mohr mentions interest-bearing capital and mer­ chants' capital only as historical facts, but expressly excludes them from all economical discussion in Book I, where capital is only con­ sidered in its simplest form as industrial capital.
A slip of the pen of Paul's p.
285: la grandeur de la plus-value est en rapport direct avec la longueur -de la journée de travail, mais en rapport inverse avec le taux du salaire.
b Du reste,c you know that my only objection to Paul's replying to Block was the fear that it might 'block' his ultimate reply to Leroy-Beaulieu.
d—If he has eingeseift' Molinari to that extent, that he al­ lows Paul to reply anything to anybody, all the better.
The report of the meeting in favour of the Germans in the Sozial­ demokrat as well as the extracts from Lyon-Socialiste 3 2 4 given there will have a capital effect in Germany and everywhere.
Nothing can strike the philistine and also the workmen of other countries more than this cordiality and working hand in hand of the proletarians of the two 'erbfeindliche Nationen^.
It ought to be mis en avant s as much and as often as possible.
As to poor Brousse, the man without a programme, being in doubt about the programme on which our people have been elected, the proclamation of Müller in Darmstadt which I was glad Guesde worked up in the Cri du Peuple will have answered him.
Better still is the Hanoverian programme in this week's Sozialdemokrat No.

325 I wish Guesde would make use ofthat.
These two proclamations, and the fact that they were issued in new districts — Darmstadt and Hano­ ver, where our people might be expected to coax votes, have given me quite as much pleasure as the elections themselves.
They show how thoroughly the revolutionary spirit has been evoked by Bismarck's persecutions.
I was almost expecting that the new districts might send 'moderate' men, but no fear of that now.
Also Sabor the Jewish schoolmaster from Frankfort belongs to the Bebel wing of the party.
Bernstein's letter to Paul about Lassalle 326 finds its explanation in this, that in Paris, as in London and New York, the old Lassalle set is still strongly represented among the Germans.

But the real question is as I stated it, and one which is not so easy, in fact, it broke down classical economy which could not solve it.
The déroute, as Mohr's manuscript calls it, e of the Ricardian school on this very questionf opened the door to vul­ gar economy.
My walks with you have done me a deal of good — I extend them every day, and my muscles are hardening again.

Poor old Mother Hess! 'Wir waben, wir waben.

Now before concluding I want to ask you a favour.
Paul has from me: 1 ) Darwin's Origin of Species, 2) Thierry, Histoire du tiers état, 3) Pa­ quet, Institutions provinciales et communales de la France, 4) Buonarotti, Conspiracy of Babeuf .
Now, Jenny had from me: 1) Die 'Edda' ', poetische und prosaische, and 2) Beowulf, both in Simrock's New High German translation.
The latter two books and Darwin I am in especial want of.

mind, I am not in such a hurry that you should rush off post haste to Argenteuil to look the books up.
Clemenceau seems to be going down morally while going up politi­ cally— this appears unavoidable in French bourgeois politics.
His vis­ it to Gladstone and the rubbish he talked there is one symptom, the other is his silence in the chamber with regard to the Socialistenhetze a and the atrocious judgments of Lyon, Montluçon, etc.
As to Paul's wish to have an Irish paper, there is none that can be recommended.
Besides if the Egalité writes up every murder, be it ever so stupid, as une exécution, Havas' telegrams are quite sufficient.
For other things the Daily News Irish correspondence will be found sufficient.
If Paul sees that the Egalité is regularly forwarded to the Sozial­ demokrat at Zurich, that paper will be duly sent in return, but I shall write to Bernstein to send it to your address, so that you get it, and not those that do not understand it.
Kind regards to Paul.

I had been prepared for this news for some time, ever since Hermann wrote to me in some detail about Emil's conditiona and especially since the week before last when your brother-in-law Colsman visited me.
We talked a great deal about Emil, Colsman being fully conversant with the medical circumstances of the case.
There was, I gathered, no more hope, the verdict had been given and the consummation could only be a matter of weeks.
And yet I had not expected that it would be so quick.
It has happened, and we must resign ourselves to it.
It has been a period of your life, dear Lottchen, such as you will never.

wish.
But remember that my mother had to endure this too.
She had 41 years of happiness and then was widowed.
And there are few women who loved their husbands more ardently than she my father.
And yet with her children and among their children and children's children she acquired a new lease of life and lived among us, at any rate not unhappily, for the next 14 years.
And she was older than you are and all her children were grown-up and provided for, whereas you still have several for whom there are duties to fulfil of a kind only a mother can fulfil and which weigh all the more heavily for their now being fatherless.
I always had a particularly intimate relationship with Emil and, however far our views may have diverged, one thing we still had in common was our preoccupation with scientific matters, irrespective of whether or not they had any immediate practical application.
One episode I shall never forget.
When, after father's death, I had to cope with a most difficult state of affairs while physically so indisposed that I was incapable of making one single urgent decision in a sound frame of mind and with faculties unimpaired, there was Emil, clear of eye, firm of resolve and in full command of the situation, to extri­ cate me and bring the negotiations in Manchester, upon which my whole future depended, to a successful conclusion.
329 If I now live here in London, a man of independent means, this is thanks not least to Emil.
Nor would my uncertain state of health deter me from leaving to­ night to pay my dear brother my last respects.
But there is the possi­ bility, indeed probability, that my presence would lead to harassment by the police and nothing in the world would induce me to expose you and the others to such a thing at this particular moment.
After all, was not a universally renowned chemist,a naturalised English­ man and member of the British Royal Society, harassed in Darm­ stadt, his native city, a few months ago simply because he had attend­ ed Marx's funeral, harassed to the extent that he at once departed? b What might I not expect? Once again I shall doubtless have to regard myself as a political refugee for the time being.
Well, dear Lottchen, one thing I do know and that is that you women are stronger and pluckier than we men.

231 134 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 316; 331 [IN BERLIN] London, 11-12 December 1884 Dear Bebel, The point of my last letter3 was as follows: Among the newly elected members some were known to me, who, by education and temperament, would throw in their weight with the right, bourgeois wing of the parliamentary group.
In view of the tremendous blandishments suddenly extended to us after our victo­ ries by all the other parties, it seemed to me not impossible that the said gentlemen might fall for the bait and be prepared to make a statement such as that demanded of us by, for instance, the Kölnische Reifung as a condition of the repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law 3 ' ' — a statement would only have to go a hair's breadth further to the right in surrendering the party's revolutionary character than did, for in­ stance, Geiser's speech during the Anti-Socialist Law debate, which Grillenberger printed alongside yours.
332 The gentlemen of the Lib­ eral Party are soft and would be content with very little; a small con­ cession on our part would have satisfied them, and it was that small concession I feared since it would have discredited us beyond all measure abroad.
I knew, of course, that it would not be made by you.
But you, i.
e.
we, might have been outvoted.
Indeed, the least sign of a split — in speeches — would have done enormous harm.
That is the reason — and the only reason — I thought it my duty to provide you with support against such an occasion by supplying you with a few handy historical arguments which, perhaps, might not be so fresh in your mind as in mine.
And so that you might show the letter to others if you thought fit, I omitted all allusions to those for whom it was, ul­ timately, intended.
Nobody is gladder than I that my fears have proved unfounded and that the power of the movement should have been such as to carry away even the bourgeois elements of the party and that the par­ liamentary group had kept abreast of the electorate.
And I must con-a See this volume, pp.

fess that I find Singer, who spent a short while here this Sunday a and will be coming to see me again next Sunday, a completely changed man.
He is beginning to believe (quite literally) that he might yet experience something in the nature of a social transformation.
I trust that it will last and that our 'eddicated' chaps will ultimately resist the temptation of showing the other parties that they're not ogres.
I have never been mistaken about our proletarian masses.
The progress of their movement — assured, confident of victory and, for that very reason, cheerful and good-humoured — is exemplary and beyond compare.
No European proletariat could have stood the test of the Anti-Socialist Law so splendidly nor, after six years of oppres­ sion, have responded by demonstrating how greatly its power had in­ creased and its organisation been consolidated.
None could have brought that organisation into being, as was done here, without any pretence at conspiracy.
And, now that I have seen the electoral mani­ festos of Darmstadt and Hanover,325 I have ceased to worry about the possibility of having to make concessions in the new districts (con­ stituencies).
If, in both those towns, they could speak in such revolu­ tionary and proletarian terms, then all is won.
It is greatly to our advantage that in Germany the industrial revo­ lution should not really have got going until now, whereas in France and England it is for the most part complete.
In those countries, the division into town and country, industrial districts and agricultural districts, is complete to the extent that such further change as there is will be very gradual.
The bulk of the people grow up in the condi­ tions in which they will subsequently have to live; they are so used to them that even fluctuations and crises come to be regarded almost as a matter of course.
Added to which is the memory of earlier, unsuc­ cessful movements.
In Germany, by contrast, everything is still in a state of flux.
What remains of the old, self-sufficient rural industrial production is being superseded by capitalist cottage industries, while elsewhere capitalist cottage industries are in their turn making way for the machine.
And it is the very nature of our industry, lagging as it does far behind all the rest, that makes the revolution b such a fun­ damental one.
Since large mass-produced articles, for the popular as well as the luxury trades, are already monopolised by the British and French, pretty well all that is left for our export industry is the insigni­ ficant stuff which, however, also runs into very large quantities, and is first manufactured by cottage industries, not being machine-made a 7 December-6 Altered in an unknown hand to 'social revolution'.
until later when it is produced in bulk.
In this way cottage industries (capitalist) are introduced into far wider fields and make an even cleaner sweep.
If I except the Prussia of the Eastern Elbe area, i.
e.
East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Posen and the larger part of Brandenburg, as well as Old Bavaria, a there are now few districts where the farmer is not being increasingly caught up in cottage in­ dustries.
The area thusb revolutionised will,c in Germany, be larger than anywhere else.
Furthermore, the fact that the worker in a cottage industry usually goes in for a bit of agriculture makes it possible to depress wages to an extent unknown elsewhere.
What used to b.
e the small man's good fortune — the combination of agriculture and industry — has now become the most effective means of capitalist exploitation.
The po­ tato plot, the cow, the little bit of husbandry, makes feasible the sale of labour power below its proper price, indeed necessitates this because it binds the worker to the soil which, after all, provides part of his nourishment.
Hence, in Germany, industry becomes capable of ex­ porting because the customer, more often than not, is presented with the entire surplus value, while the capitalist's profits derive from deduc­ tions made from the normal working wage.
This applies to pretty well all rural cottage industries, more so in Germany than anywhere else.
Moreover, our industrial revolution, set in train by the revolution of 1848 and its bourgeois advances (puny though these were), was enormously speeded up 1) by the removal, between 1866 and 1870, of internal obstaclesd and 2) by the French milliards, destined as these were for capitalist investment.
333 In this way we have achieved an industrial revolution that is more thoroughgoing and fundamen­ tal, more extensive and comprehensive than in any other country; we have done so with a completely fresh, intact proletariat, undemoral-ised by defeat and, finally — thanks to Marx — with an insight into the causes of economic and political developments and into the prere­ quisites for the impending revolution such as none of our predecessors possessed.
But for that very reason we are under an obligation to win.
As regards pure democracy and its future role, I am not of your opinion.
That it plays a far more subordinate role in Germany than in countries long since industrialised, goes without saying.
But that will not prevent it qua extreme bourgeois party — which, after all, it a Old Bavaria: Upper and Lower Bavaria and Upper Palatinate.

had already made itself out to be at Frankfurt — from acquiring, at the moment of revolution, a temporary significance as the last sheet-anchor of the bourgeois and, indeed, feudal economy generally.
334 At such a moment the entire reactionary mass will align itself behind it and swell its ranks, whereupon all erstwhile reactionaries will act as though they were democrats.
It was thus that, from March to Sep­ tember 1848, the entire feudal-bureaucratic mass swelled the ranks of the Liberals in order to keep down the revolutionary masses and, having done so, kick out the Liberals as a matter of course.
It was thus that in France in 1848, from May until Bonaparte's3 election in December, the purely Republican party of Le National, 335 the very weakest of them all, was able to hold sway thanks only to the forces of reaction, all of which rallied to its defences.
It has always been thus in every revolution: The tamest party still capable of governing takes its turn at the helm precisely because the vanquished look to it as their last hope of salvation.
Now we cannot expect to have the majority of the electorate, i.
e.
of the nation, already at our backs when the cru­ cial moment comes.
The whole of the middle and the residue of the feudal, land-owning class, and the better part of the petty bourgeoisie as of the rural population, will then rally round the most extreme bourgeois — in word by now the most extreme revolutionary — party which will, I think, most probably be represented in the provisional government, indeed might actually form its majority for a time.
How, as a minority, one ought not to act in such a case was demonstrated in Paris in 1848 by the Social Democratic minority in the February gov­ ernment.
336 However, for the moment this question remains an aca­ demic one.
Now in Germany matters might take a different course, and this for military reasons.
As things are at present, an impulse from without would be unlikely to come from anywhere but Russia.
Should it fail to come, and the impulse emanate from Germany, the revolution could only emanate from the army.
An unarmed population confronted by a modern army is militarily an altogether infinitesimal quantity.
In that event — when our reserves of 20-or 25-year-olds, who do not vote, but train, would go into action — pure democracy might be given a miss.
But here again the question is, at present, still academic although I, as representative, so to speak, of the party's Great General Staff, am obliged to bear it in mind.
At all events, on the crucial day and the day after that, our only adversary will be collective reaction centred round pure democracy and this, I think, ought never to be lost from view.
a Napoleon III If you people table motions in the Reichstag, there is one thing you should not forget.
State-owned land is for the most part rented out to big farmers, only very little being sold to smallholders whose plots, however, are so diminutive that these new smallholders are reduced to hiring themselves out by the day to the large farms.
What should be demanded is the leasing of large, undivided estates to cooperatives of agricultural workers to be farmed communally.
The Empire possesses no estates and this will presumably provide a pretext for throwing out any such motion.
But I believe that this firebrand ought to be cast among the agricultural day labourers, which is quite possible in view of the many debates about state socialism.
This and this alone will en­ able you to rope in the agricultural workers.
It is the best way of showing them that they are ultimately destined to run the big estates of those who are now their lords and masters, and to run them for the common weal.
And with this friend Bismarck and his demand that you make positive proposals ought to be satisfied for a while.
Warmest regards.

Let me assure you of my warmest sympathy.
It is one of the more sombre aspects of exile which I, too, have come to know.
The fatherland as such is something one can easily dispense with, but — Now for events over here.
On Saturday the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FED­ ERATION300 happily disintegrated.
The bubble burst somewhat sooner than I had expected, but it was bound to come.
Hyndman, a political adventurer with aspirations to a carrière in Parliament, had long since gained control of the whole business.
When, a year ago, Bax launched To-Day, there was not enough lit­ erary talent to keep the little affair going, let alone a weekly, but a weekly Hyndman must needs have.
Hence Justice was founded — with money given by two enthusiasts, Morris and Carpenter; it was edited by Hyndman with the aid of a few young literati who were on the look-out for some new movement capable of paying them (Fitzger­ ald and Champion) and one Joynes, a teacher dismissed from Eton for agitation conducted in company with Henry George,3 and hence a socialist, willy-nilly.
These men were paid, directly or indirectly — Hyndman is rich but tight-fisted—, the rest had to contribute gratis.
All the FEDERATION'S papers went to Hyndman, Fitzgerald and Cham­ pion, who placed before the Council only what they thought fit, and corresponded off their own bat in the FEDERATION'S name; in short, Hyndman treated the Council as Bismarck treats the Reichstag.
Loud complaints; they even reached me.
I said: 'Give the man his head.
He's a petty-minded chap and won't last long, for he cannot wait.
'b And he has come a cropper sooner than I thought he would.
Morris, who was in Scotland a fortnight ago, uncovered there such intrigues on Hyndman's part that he said he could no longer continue to work with the fellow.
He had long had his suspicions.
An interview with Andreas Scheu in Edinburgh brought matters to a head.
339 Hyndman had defamed Scheu by calling him an anarchist and dyna­ miter— Scheu was able to provide Morris not only with proof to the contrary, but also of the fact that Hyndman knew this.
Similar mach­ inations of Hyndman's in Glasgow, where the branch had received letters from the secretary, Fitzgerald, bearing the FEDERATION'S stamp but which had not only not been written at the behest of the Council, but actually in defiance of its resolutions.
Furthermore, Hyndman had told several people that a somewhat mysterious letter to the Council in Paris was a forgery concocted by Mme Lafargue and Tussy with a view to laying a trap for him.
However, he had withheld the actual letter from the Council.
Finally, in addition to having re­ peatedly stirred up strife between members of the Council, he was shown to have fabricated a provincial branch which did not exist at all.
In short, last Tuesday0 things came to a head.
Hyndman was at­ tacked from every side, Scheu himself was there, documents in hand.
Tussy had a letter from her sister about the alleged forgery.
There was a row.
Meeting adjourned till Saturday.
Morris and Aveling came to see me beforehand, when I was able to give them some further advice.
Big debate on the Saturday.
None of the facts could be denied, either by Hyndman or by the supporters he had drummed up.
Motion of censure on Hyndman adopted.
Whereupon the ma­ jority resigned from the FEDERATION.
The grounds for this were, 1 ) that " See this volume, pp.

-c 23 December at a congress, Hyndman might fabricate a majority with the aid of his BOGUS branch, while they would be unable to prove the non-existence of that branch, or at any rate not until it was too late, 2) —and this was the main reason — because the entire FEDERATION was, after all, no better than a racket.
3*0 Those who resigned were Aveling, Bax and Morris, the only honest ones amongst the literati, but also three as unpractical men — two poets and a philosopher—as it is possible to find.
Also, the cream of the better-known working men.
They intend to do the rounds of the London branches in the hope of winning over the majority, where­ upon they will let Hyndman and his non-existent provincial branches go whistle.
Their organ is to be a little monthly.
" At last they are go­ ing to operate modestly and in accordance with their powers, and not go on pretending that the English proletariat must instantly jump to it the moment the trumpet is sounded by a few literary converts to so­ cialism.
(In London, according to Morris' admission, they were 400 strong at the outside and barely 100 in the provinces.
) The circula­ tion of Justice is about 3,500.
Hyndman is retaining Justice and To-Day, together with his specu­ lative literati Fitzgerald, Champion, Burrows, Shaw and possibly also Sketchley who, as a former Chartist, presumably considers himself en­ titled to a pension.
Add to that what remains of the old democratic or socialist sects.
Whose prize the other remnants of the FEDERATION will be, remains to be seen.
But since Hyndman will no longer be getting any money either from Morris or from Carpenter for his unprofitable organs, he will either have to pay up himself, or sell himself, his organs and the remnants of his faction to the CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS or — to Lord Randolph Churchill and Tory DEMOCRACY.
He'll have to look sharp if he wants to stand for Parliament in the elections next autumn.
I have the satisfaction of having seen through the whole racket from the outset, correctly sized up all the people concerned and fore­ told what the end would be, and similarly that the said racket would eventually do more harm than good.

241-42 138 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN London, 30 December 1884 Dear Bebel, I hasten to reply to your letter.
Friend Singer would seem to have digested only such of my re­ marks as accorded with his own views: one soon learns how to do this in business where it may sometimes help, but in politics as in science one should, after all, learn to take an objective view of things.
To begin with, I told Singer that I had not yet by any means given the matter adequate thought (my attention having been drawn to it only the evening before by the Sozialdemokrat), 3'12 and that what I was saying could by no means be regarded as my final verdict.
Next, I went on to say that, under certain circumstances and on certain conditions, it might be admissible to vote for it, i.
e.
if the government were to undertake to accord to the workers the same state aid it was now prepared to accord to the bourgeoisie.
In particular, that is, the leasing of state-owned land to workers' cooperatives, etc.
Since I know very well that the government will not do so, this is another way of saying that those who would like to vote for it should be shown how they can vote against it with a semblance of decency and without doing violence to themselves.
I further told Singer—and this seemed news to him — that in par­ liamentary life one may often find oneself in the position of having to vote against something which one would privately like to see carried.
Well, yesterday I wrote to Liebknecht about other matters and took the opportunity of giving him what was now, after long reflec­ tion, a considered view of the case.
a In many respects it tallies almost word for word — get him to read you that bit of my letter some time — with what you say, although your letter did not arrive until this morning.
Where I diverge from you is, briefly, as follows: 1.
You are above ali a party versed in economics.
You, or some of you, have at various times made a great show of the party's superi-a See previous letter.
241 ority in this field, yet as soon as you were confronted in practice with your first economic question, you fell out — over protective tariffs.
343 But if the same thing is going to happen each time an economic ques­ tion crops up, what is the point of having a parliamentary group at all? 2.
On principle, you ought to vote against it.
I told Liebknecht so plainly enough.
But suppose the majority want to vote for it? In that case, the only thing to do is to persuade them to attach such condi­ tions to their vote as will excuse it, at any rate to the extent that no odium attaches to them in the eyes of Europe, as would otherwise in­ evitably happen.
Those conditions, however, are, and can only be, such that the government cannot agree to them, i.
e.
that the majority of the parliamentary group, should they attach those conditions to their vote, will not be able to vote for it.
Needless to say, I could never have considered an unconditional vote in favour of presenting the bourgeoisie with working men's pennies.
But neither, for that matter, could the cardinal question — the dis­ ruption of the parliamentary group — have been envisaged in this context.
To my mind, your best way of dealing with all such questions, if you want to take account of the voters' petty-bourgeois prejudices, is to say: 'On principle we're against it.
But since you wish us to make positive proposals and since you maintain that these things would also be of benefit to the workers, which we contest in so far as any­ thing more than a microscopic advantage is concerned — well and good.
You must place workers and bourgeoisie on an equal footing.
For every million you take from the worker's pocket and give to the bourgeoisie, directly or indirectly, you must give the workers a mil­ lion; the same applies to loans made by the state.
' I.
e.
more or less as follows (only by way of an example and without regard for the par­ ticular form it would have to assume for Germany, since I am too little acquainted with the details of existing legislation): 1) The granting of subventions and advances to workers' coopera­ tives, not for the purpose, or not so much for the purpose, of starting up new businesses (which would be no better than Lassalle's propo­ sal, with all its deficiencies) as, in particular, in order to a) take on lease and farm cooperatively state-owned land (or other types of landed property); b) purchase for their own or the government account and operate as cooperatives factories, etc.
, which, at a time of crisis or, perhaps, 242 due to bankruptcy, have been shut down by their owners or have oth­ erwise come on the market, and thus pave the way for the gradual transition of all production to cooperative production.
2) Preference to be given to cooperatives over capitalists and the latters' associations in all public contracts, and on the same terms; i.
e.
as a general principle, contracts for public works to be accorded wherever possible to cooperatives.
3) The removal of all legal obstacles and difficulties that still stand in the way of free cooperatives, i.
e.
above all the reinstatement of the working class within the common law — pitiful though this may be — by the repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law 37 which, after all, is the ruin of all trade associations and cooperatives.
4) Complete freedom for trade associations (TRADE UNIONS) and their recognition as legal persons with all the latters' rights.
By demanding this, all you demand is that equal consideration be accorded to workers and bourgeois alike; and if gifts to the bourgeois will allegedly boost industry, will not gifts to the workers boost it far more? Without any such quid pro quo, I fail to see how a Social Demo­ cratic parliamentary group could vote for anything of the sort.
If you confront the people with such demands, the electorate, too, would soon stop pestering you about state aid for industry in the shape of gifts to the bourgeoisie.
All these are matters which could be initiated here and now and actually set in train within the year, being obstruct­ ed only by the bourgeoisie and the government.
And yet, as things now are, these are important measures whose impact upon the work­ ers would be a very different affair from that made by steamship sub­ sidies, 342 protective tariffs, etc.
And the French are demanding essentially the same.
But now for something else which has only just come to light.
The outcome of the division will, as likely as not, be determined by the So­ cial Democrats.
And what utter asses you would look in the eyes of the whole world if this business of donations to the bourgeoisie were to be the work of your votes] And without any quid pro quo! I really do not know what, in that case, I should tell the French and the people over here.
And what a triumph for the anarchists, who would say exultantly: 'There you are — they're out-and-out philistines!' I shall go into the other matters another time, since I am anxious that you should not for a moment be in doubt as to my views on this point.
I trust that the change in your business affairs 344 will above all be beneficial to your health.
With all good wishes to you and your family for the New Year.
Your F.
E.
That there won't be enough money is clear as day.
And another thing I told Singer was that anyone who votes for it must, if he is to be consistent, also vote for colonies.
As regards the point about money, see my letter to Liebknecht.

Capital, Book II (some 600 pages of print) will go to press in Janu­ ary.
The editing will have been completed in about 10 days' time, af­ ter which all that will remain to be done is the revision of the fair copy.
It's been quite a task — there were 2 complete and 6 partial texts! 17 Then, as soon as I have attended to a few urgent intermediate jobs, it will be the turn of Book III.

pivot for my whole history of Germany.
It will be some task.
But the preliminary studies are as good as finished.
The English translation of Capital is coming along slowly, more than half having been finished.
Tussy's husband, Aveling, is helping with it, but doesn't do it as thoroughly as Sam Moore, who is doing the main part.
56 This summer Schorlemmer was subjected to a domiciliary search in Darmstadt for suspected distribution of the Sozialdemokrat.
304 Great uproar amongst the philistines has earned us some 500 votes.
On Saturday the DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION here was disrupted.
30 ° Hyndman, an adventurer who had gained control of the whole affair, was unmasked as a fomenter of strife between the members, a with-holder of correspondence intended for the COUNCIL and a founder of BOGUS BRANCHES in the provinces so that meetings and congresses might be packed with his own creatures.
Though a vote of censure was passed on him, the majority resigned, mainly on the grounds that the whole organisation was simply a racket.
And it's true.
They haven't got 400 paid-up members, and their readers consist of sentimental bourgeois.
They now intend to start a new organisation (Morris, Bax, Aveling, etc.
) 346 and leave Justice and To-Day to Hyndman and his lot (Fitzgerald, Champion, Burrows, etc.
), while they themselves, having at last recognised the weakness of their own effectives, will start off with a little MONTHLY.
a As the capitalists who provided the money have also resigned (they, more than anyone else, were sensible of their exploitation by Hyndman) he, Hyndman, will either have to pay for his own unprofitable papers himself or else sell the entire party, in so far as it adheres to him (this will transpire in a week's time), to the highest bidder.
And, being intent on getting into Parlia­ ment at the next elections, he will have to hurry.
Petty-bourgeois prejudice of every kind is to be found among the German deputies, as, for instance, the desire of the majority to vote for the steamship subsidies 'in the interests of industry'.
342 Which pro­ vides me with correspondence and to spare.
Luckily we have Bebel there who invariably gets hold of the right end of the stick, and I therefore hope that the whole thing will go off without our being dis­ credited.
Ever since I have conducted the 'official' correspondence with Bebel instead of with Liebknecht, not only does all go smoothly, but something actually comes of it, and my views are presented to the a The Commonweal chaps in their entirety.
Bebel is a really splendid fellow and I hope he won't ruin his health which is none too good.
But now here's to a Happy New Year and an improvement in your own health — regards to Adolf.

Thank you for the Volkszeitung in which the wise man expresses his reservations about the abolition of the state.
If I were to try and reply to such doubts, I would simply have to shelve my other work.
Apro­ pos, the Volkszeitung is no longer sending me its weekly edition.

Moore and Jollymeyer are off to Tussy's and so I have profited of the occasion to shake off a lot of business let­ ters— a few moments remain before 5.
30.
I had paid for your Justice up to 31 December, but as I had no proper receipt, could not do much — besides every letter of mine to anybody at that office was followed by an application from them for an article of mine, so that I really could not write to them even on business.
However Edward says he pays to the Modern Press and so I have sent the money today for both you and myself for 6 months' Justice and To-Day and hope you will get it.
What we can get of back numbers you shall also have, but there is not much in it worth your notice, the leaning towards the Possibilists is of quite recent date and not at all pronounced, except last No.
[with] a letter from Adolphe Smith.
348 Now however it's sure to bloom out.
Last night we were at Pumps', she is uncommonly well but over­ does it a little — the baby all right.
I am sorry the crisis in the Social Democratic Federationa could not be retarded a little longer; Hyndman would have got deeper into the mud, and the personal element would have been thrown more into the background.
However it could not be helped.
The reason why the majority, instead of following up their victory, resigned, and starts a new organisation346 was this chiefly, as Morris said to me: a See this volume, p.
245.
that the old organisation was.
not worth having.
The London branches are about 300 strong in all and those they hope mostly to get, and as to the provinces, it's all bosh and bogus.
Well we'll see what they will make.
There is this to be said in their favour: that three more unpractical men for a political organisation than Aveling, Bax and Morris are not to be found in all England.
But they are sincere.
Again Happy New Year to both of you and to the poor little onesa at Argenteuil when you see them, from Nim and myself.

349:1 have advised her of its receipt and told her I hope to be able to revise it next week.
The Condition of the Working-Class has not as yet been en­ tirely prised out of Wigand's hands.
From what Freytag the lawyer said, the old contract, which envisaged a second edition, was still in force about 10 years ago.
40 Since then I have on several occasions tried to find out from Freytag how I stood with Wigand under Sax­ on law but have never received an answer.
So long as I remain in a the Longuets' children doubt on this point I shan't know what steps I can take.
I have also told Dietz as much39 but heard nothing further after that; he spoke of bringing out a new edition but I was not told anything definite.
However a new edition would not be possible without various notes by me, which in turn would involve consulting sundry works of refer­ ence and, in places, call for study and this I cannot take on at the mo­ ment as I have more than enough to do.
I might consider it towards the middle of the year.
So I think the best thing would be simply to let the matter rest till then.
Now, however, Ede tells me that my Anti-Dilhring ought to be reprinted.
20B After considerable thought I have decided that it should be brought out unaltered.
I owe this to my opponent and shall simply provide a new preface,a also appendices to some of the chapters, which can go together at the end.
Then a new preface.
This, too, I shall find time for.
So if you want work for the press, I would suggest you start with that.
Besides, the thing is not particularly urgent and can therefore be printed at your con­ venience.
I hope to finish Marx's Capital, Book II, in January and then pro­ ceed at once to rewrite the Peasant War.
2 '3 That will take a good 6 weeks.
But I must be quit of it so as to get on with Capital, Book III.
To begin with, this will be a purely daytime occupation, leaving my evenings to some extent free, when I can attend to the Condition of the Working-Class — if, that is, the revision of sundry translations, at­ tending to proofs, etc.
, leaves me time for it.
So think the matter over and let me know what you have decided.
I shall gladly do all I can to help you.
Kindest regards and a Happy New Year to the colony at large.

144 ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY IN VIENNA London, 13 January 1885 Dear Kautsky, I trust this will still catch you in Vienna.
It was only a day or two ago that I received the 1st number of the Neue £eit.
Can you get hold of about 2 or 3 more copies for me? Hav­ ing promised Rudolf Meyer my critique of Rodbertus, a I can hardly send him a copy — the poor conservative social muddle-head is on tenterhooks — without also doing Mme Lafargue and Tussy the same service.
I would also ask you to send me copies of the Poverty of Philosophy for the above.
The thing is advertised as having 'appeared'.
Groß would appear to be a blockhead, though an honest one.
I have nothing against the biography; if you intend to lambast him for his confusion over theory, I don't envy you your task.
350 Give Frankel my kind regards.
No doubt you will tell me what he is in fact up to.
The New Year's card he and the others sent me gave me much pleasure.
Well, that's all until you come over here.

208 I have not read the philistine's reply,a nor do I wish to do so.
Reply he cannot and he's welcome to lay about him with as much insolent verbiage as he wishes.
I have long been searching in vain for the Rheinische Leitung Revue.
I only have numbers 3, 5 and 6; 1, 2 and 4 are missing.
3 5 2 There are virtually no articles in them worth reprinting.
Numbers 1-4 contain Marx's history of the French Revolution from 1848 to 1850b (comprised in the 18th Brumaire) and my account of events in May 1849 in the Rhineland and Baden-Palatinate.
c Then the Peasant Ward (5 and 6) and short critical essays, as also a review of daily events.
6 The right to work is not touched on other than very briefly in, I think, Number If; Marx wasn't much interested in catchphrases.
It would be quite a good idea for you to inquire from Wigand in your own name about a new edition of the Condition etc.
, 40 but that won't get us very much further.
I have got to know how I stand with him in law and shall inquire again from Freytag.

146 ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH London, 17 January 1885 Dear Mr Schlüter, As regards the Anti-Dühring, I would further advise you that 1) the old preface is followed by another to the 2nd edition which, however, I can't really do as yet; so doubtless you will, as usual, begin with the actual text and leave preface and title to the last; 2) such additions as there are will appear as an appendix.
3 I have heard from Bonnb that the Origin of the Family etc.
is not ob­ tainable in the bookshops; according to the booksellers they have had word from Switzerland — from the publisher — that the book has been banned and various friends have been bombarding me with in­ quiries as to where the book may be obtained.
Since there has, to my knowledge, been no public ban, while a secret ban would be nonsensi­ cal, and since the assumption that Zurich has been spreading rumours of a ban is even more nonsensical, I find the matter puzzling.
Could it be that the government, to spare itself the ridicule that would come of a public ban, has persuaded Schabelitz's agents in Leipzig to spread such things about and thus make sales more difficult? Perhaps you would be good enough to start inquiries over there and let me know the result; I shall also try to find out whether the same tactics are be­ ing pursued elsewhere.
What is Ede doing? I have had neither sight nor sound of him.

-b in a letter Hagen wrote to Engels 147 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL IN BERLIN London, 19 January 1885 Dear Bebel, I hope you have had my last registered letter concerning the mat­ ter of the Steamship Bill (of 30 or 31 December).
3 Today I must trou­ ble you with an inquiry.
Mr Franz Mehring has now written to me for the second time asking me to place at his disposal material for a biography, etc.
, of Marx and, amongst other things, has the nerve to presume that I send him 'on loan' to Berlin irreplaceable editions of ours which he is unable to procure over there! I shall not reply, but send a message via Hirsch.
But if I am to strike the right note, I ought to know something more definite about his past and present and about his attitude towards the party.
Generally speaking, all I know is that, some time before 1878, he was pretty roundly taken to task in the Volksstaat and the Vorwärts for being a reptile 3 5 3 and a defector from the party and, from the few writings of his which have fallen into my hands, I have seen that he was making literary use of such in­ timate knowledge as he had of the movement to dole out liberal portions of 'truth and fiction'b about it to your philistine, and to pass himself off as an authority in such matters.
If he has done anything especially underhand that might single him out from the rest of the literary rabble, it would be most helpful for me to know it.
354 Then there's another thing.
I am being strongly urged to bring out a new edition of my Condition of the Working-Class.
I can do absolutely nothing about it before finding out what my legal position is in regard to Wigand, the previous publisher.
40 I have asked Liebknecht about this umpteen times, and on each occasion he has undertaken to ob­ tain the information for me from Freytag, but none has ever been forthcoming.
And who was the first to express surprise that nothing had been settled? Why, Liebknecht, of course.
Now since it would be a See this volume, pp.

-b 'Wahrheit und Dichtung' in the original, which is a paraphrase of the title of Goethe's autobiographical book Dichtung und Wahrheit, 'Dichtung' meaning 'poetry, fiction'.
folly to entrust him with any further errands, I must once again bother you, and ask you to obtain for me from Freytag, or some other Saxon advocate, a reply to the enclosed questions.
As soon as I have that reply I can, and intend to, proceed.
To return to Germany's industrial position, I readily concede that enormous progress has been made since 1866, and more especially since 1871.
But the contrast with other countries still remains, none­ theless.
England had had the monopoly of mass-produced articles and France that of the finer luxury and fashion goods, and in this re­ spect there has not, after all, been any change worth mentioning.
In iron, it is true, Germany is, together with America, second only to England; but she is very far from attaining the level of English mass-production and can only hope to compete by selling at a loss.
In cot­ ton, Germany manufactures only subsidiary articles for the world market.
The massive quantities of yarn and other woven goods (SHIRT­ INGS and other mass-produced articles) for the Indian and Chinese market are still an English monopoly, and such competition as there may be in this sphere comes, not from Germany but from America.
In woollen goods, too, England still dominates the world market, ditto in linen (Ireland).
Birmingham is still the centre for hardware for domestic use, etc.
, as Sheffield is for cutlery, and the great­ est threat of competition is still posed by America, not Germany.
Machinery (with the exception of locomotives), England and America.
In the matter of fashion goods, France has lost a lot of ground.
Here, too, fashion has changed considerably, and this certainly ap--plies to Germany also.
Both countries, however, and Germany in par­ ticular, produce in the main 2nd, 3rd and 4th class goods and still to a large extent depend on the Paris fashions.
Meanwhile it is obvious that, in the case of buyers who consist almost exclusively of parvenus, 2nd and 3rd class articles play a considerable role and can be sold to these boors as "ist class goods.
One thing, however, is certain: the large bulk of German exports is composed of a mass of what, seen individually, are more or less in­ significant articles, the manufacture of which, in so far as fashion comes into it, depends largely on the theft of Parisian patterns — e.
g.
the women's coat trade in Berlin — as is openly admitted in the Kölnische Reifung.
Moreover, foreign cloth is largely used for the purpose.
I believe the world market can be more accurately sized up from this country than from over there; but in doing so I have regularly followed the specialised German trade reports and hence see both sides of the picture.
I wish I could sometime spare a moment to write something from this standpoint on the subject of protective tariffs in Germany.
They are completely cock-eyed.
German industry devel­ oped and became capable of exporting under a system of free trade more comprehensive than in any other industrial country save Eng­ land— and it is being restricted by protective tariffs in the very sphere in which it is capable of exporting! That the exporters should be demanding protective tariffs is characteristic of Germany — we must have them so as to be able to sell to other countries at a loss and yet show a profit at the end of the year! What we give to other countries must be paid back to us at home, just as we present other countries with the surplus value and make our profits from deductions made on wages! N.

356 Once these two countries had been won over to such a cause, the rest of Europe was bound to follow suit.
There was even reason to hope that America might also be moved to act in similar fash­ ion.
Now, The Pall Mall Gazette of 15 January contained an article by Mme Novikov, devil's advocate of tsarism, appealing yet again to England to desist from giving asylum to the Gartmans, the Stepnyaks and all those who 'organise assassination in Russia'.
8 The English, she goes on, are now threatened with similar chemical attacks; the refuge they afford to the Russian dynamiters is likewise afforded by America to the Irish dynamiters.
What England is asking of America is pre­ cisely what Russia is asking of England.
All this is plain enough.
But there is better to come.
On the morn­ ing of 24 January all the newspapers carried the text of an agreement, concluded through diplomatic channels, between St Petersburg and Berlin whereby the extradition of political offenders was to be ex­ tended to Germany and thence to the rest of Europe.
357 And on the afternoon of that same day, the 24th of January, London was terrorised by a threefold explosion, one in the House of Commons, directed against the legislature, one in Westminster Hall directed against the judiciary, and one in the Tower, directed against the executive.
This time it was no longer a matter of blow­ ing up public lavatories or of frightening travellers on the under­ ground railway.
358 Rather it was a concerted attack upon the three great powers of state, symbolised by the buildings in which they as­ semble.
Is this no more than an act perpetrated by a handful of Fenian hotheads? Might it not rather be the great coup tsarism needed to bring off if it was to compel England to join the ranks of its anti-revolutionary league? If the dynamite was of Russian origin, and handled by Russian agents, could it, I ask, have exploded,at a time better calculated to prostrate a terrified and repentant John Bull at the feet of Alexander III?

Dear Madam, I hope you have received the letter I wrote to you about the time of the New Year.
39 I now forward to you, registered, the ms.
you sent to me, and only regret that press of work prevented my returning it earlier.
349 I have looked it over carefully, and entered some corrections and suggestions in pencil, in order to show you how I should like it translated.
Here and there you may find that my suggestions, taken together with the rest of the sentence, will not turn out to be correct English; in these cases I left it to you to set that right.
As for the technical terms, if you will be good enough to forward me from time to time a list of them with the pages on which they oc­ cur, I shall be glad to give you the English equivalents.
The German preface (as well as the English dedication) 359 I would, in your place, leave out entirely.
They contain nothing of interest now.
The first part of the preface refers to a phase of intellec­ tual development in Germany and elsewhere which is now almost forgotten, and the second part is in our days superfluous.
As to translations of my other writings you will understand as a matter of course that I cannot now take any positive engagements.
There are people here who wish to translate one thing or another, and I have consented conditionally, that is to say if they find a pub­ lisher and really undertake the work.
The English preface I shall write 360 when things are a little more advanced.
In the meantime I remain Yours very truly, F.

Surely you can see for yourself how these impudent rascals are misusing you.
The man is quite incorrigible, just like his friend Quarck — they're both Quark*—, and if they fall into line with you people and you accept them, I shall fall somewhat out of line.
Won't you ever get it into your head that this semi-educated pack of literati can only spoil and adulterate the party? From what you say, Viereck ought never to get into the Reichstag either! The petty-bourgeois ele­ ment in the party is increasingly gaining the upper hand.
They want to suppress Marx's name as much as possible.
If things go on like this, there will be a split in the party, on that you may depend.
You blame it all on their worships the philistines having been affronted.
But there are moments when that must be done or else they get above them­ selves.
Is then the subsection on German, or true, socialism b to be­ come applicable again 40 years later? For the rest I am keeping well, though I have a hellish lot to do and cannot write long letters.

Dear Madam, I herewith return Mr Putnam's letter — of course it would be a splendid success if we could secure publication" by that firm — but I am afraid Mr Putnam will stick to his objections, the great strength of which, from a publisher's standpoint, I fully recognise.
Perhaps the fact that a new German edition of my work is in actual preparation, may shake him a little.
My friends in Germany say that the book is important to them just now because it describes a state of things which is almost exactly reproduced at the present moment in Ger­ many; and, as the development of manufacturing industry, steam and machinery and their social outcrop in the creation of a proletari­ ate, in America corresponds at the present moment as nearly as possi­ ble to the English status of 1844 (though your go-ahead people are sure to outstrip the old world in the next 15-20 years altogether) the comparison of industrial England of 1844 with industrial America of 1885 might have its interest too.
Of course in the new preface to the English translation360 I shall refer as fully as space will permit to the changes in the condition of the British working class which have taken place in the interval; to the improved position of a more or less privileged minority, to the cer­ tainly not alleviated misery of the great body, and especially to the impending change for the worse which must necessarily follow from the break-down of the industrial monopoly of England in conse­ quence of the increasing competition in the markets of the world, of Continental Europe and especially of America.

364 The item about the Neue Rheinische Leitung.
Revue, edited by Karl Marx, Hamburg and London, 1850, is absolutely correct.
It appeared in Heft* I-VI and was pub­ lished by Schuberth in Hamburg.
You yourself asked me a few months ago for information about the articles by Marx which ap­ peared in the Revue on the subject of the February revolution and the events that followed it.
' 56 I possess only 3 of the instalments and have tried in vain to get hold of the complete set.
The other facts provided by Groß are also correct, if memory serves me aright (Tussy has got my copy, so I can't compare it).
Needless to say, I in no way agree with his silly strictures on Marx's theories.
He was recommended to me by the Viennese socialists and, in reply to some biographical ques­ tions he put to me, I gave him the facts.
The German translation of the Poverty contains just a few explana­ tory notes by me,118 but also an article written by Marx in 1865 on Proudhon and his speech of 1847 on free trade.
The 2nd volume of Capital is now being printed; yesterday I cor­ rected the 4th sheet.
The rest of the manuscript goes off from here in a fortnight's time.
The 3rd volume will be the most important one, and I shall get to work on it as soon as the 2nd has been well and truly launched.
— The English edition is dragging its feet, the two translators'1 being too busy with other matters to work at it with the proper ardour.
It will be finished, I hope, come the sum­ mer.
56 I had already heard that you were having trouble with your eyes.
Would it not be wise to give up working for a time so as not to tire your eyesight unduly? I find that, at our age, it is always best to tackle morbid symptoms when they first occur.
Let's hope that you will be able to let me have better news before too long.

209 In Wigand's case *° matters stand thus: it had already been noted in Leipzig in 1875 or 1876 that no more copies of the Condition were available and I possess the original invoice marked 'last copies'.
How­ ever no harm can be done if confirmation of this is once again provid­ ed by the other party.
I have at long last been given a legal opinion from which I gather that the matter is by no means as simple as had appeared at first glance.
Now that I know how I stand, I shall take further steps and advise you as soon as I receive a positive reply from Wigand.
I knew Schabelitz even before 1848 when he was here in London and belonged to the Communist Society.
162 Give him my kindest re­ gards when you see him.
Your explanation re the alleged 'ban' was just what I wanted366; it is quite typical of the German book trade.
Obviously nothing can be done about it so long as not one agent can be found who is possessed of pluck.
But the bulk of bourgeois readers don't buy our stuff, so in this case pluck is not a particularly paying proposition.
It was a different matter when banned books were merely liberal or radical, or even when, prior to 1848, communism was still a cause with which the bourgeoisie flirted.
The last ms.
of the 2nd book of Capital goes off tomorrow, and day after tomorrow I shall start on the 3rd book.
So long as I have it on my conscience, I shall be unable to give serious thought to anything else.
Please tell Ede that I shall write to him as soon as I have a spare moment.

For evening calls are getting rather frequent of late, more than is desirable some­ times, when there is work to do.
And the dictated portions of the Capi­ tal" I am obliged to look over while the thing is fresh in my mind and the original at hand ready to correct mistakes.
Moreover, there are still translations to revise (last week part of a Danish one of my Ursprung" — very fair) and Russian pamphlets to decipher (Vera Zasoulitch has sent me one of Plechanoff, polemical against Lavroff and Tichomiroff, c and wants me to give her my opinion,d and besides these Russian quarrels are not uninteresting) and such like, so that besides the current small fry I have not had time to read a book for months.
The 3rd book [of] Capital is getting grander and grander the deep­ er I get into it, and I am only (having passed over entirely about 70 pages, more or less superseded by a later manuscript) at page 230 out of 525.
It is almost inconceivable how a man who had such tremendous discoveries, such an entire and complete scientific revolu­ tion in his head, could keep it there for 20 years.
For the ms.
I am working at, has been written either before, or at the same time as the first volume; and the essential part of it is already in the old manu­ script of 1860-1862.
171 The fact is, first the intricacies of the 2nd book (which he wrote last and which alone he touched after 1870) kept him fast, as he of course would have to publish his 3 books in regular order; and then, his Russian and American material for the theory of the rent of land80 would have required working up into the old manuscript and would probably have nearly doubled its size.

I, Paris, 1956 157 ENGELS TO RICHARD STEGEMANN IN TÜBINGEN [Draft] [London,] 26 March 1885 Dear Sir, I hardly imagine that I would be capable of acceding to your request.
371 You might, it is true, be able to produce a fairly clear portrait of Marx the man from all the activities, both literary and political, Marx engaged in; information on these activities is of course freely available to the world at large, with the single excep­ tion of Germany, most of the requisite material having appeared abroad.
On the other hand, a character sketch by me would neces­ sarily be brief, hence not only inadequate but + a dogmatic and likewise 'belletristic', hence worse than nothing at all.
Besides I can­ not presume that my assessment should be taken by you for gospel, and so could not tell what would ultimately become of my contribu­ tion, even having regard to your indisputable bona fides.
If, how­ ever, you proceed on the assumption that Marx was the exact op­ posite of the German philistine in every conceivable respect, you can't go far wrong.
Whether this is now the precise moment for a critique of Marx, more or less what with the 2nd book of Capital due to appear in a month or two and with work proceeding on the 3rd, is for you to decide.
At all events you are right in saying that criticism and so-called 'scholarship' have disclosed nothing hitherto save a 'general lack of judgment', and no one was more amused by that than Marx himself.
I can still see him laughing over the despairing sighs of Mr Schäme who had studied Capital for ten years and still hadn't understood it.

So far I am pretty well, though not, it is true, as yet fit for active service, nor am I likely ever to be able to mount a horse again, but I am still perky enough for peacetime work.
2/3 of the sec­ ond volume of Capital have been printed and the book will be ap­ pearing in some 2 months' time, while work on the third volume is well advanced.
This last, which contains the final conclusions and, indeed, some quite brilliant stuff, will revolutionise economics once and for all and create a tremendous sensation.
In the meantime things are beginning to liven up again.

-b William I For us, the most favourable situation will arise when, at the moment of revolution, the most radical elements of the bourgeoisie are every­ where at the helm — Clemenceau in France, Dilke and Chamberlain in this country and Richter in Germany — so that when they have ruined themselves, the revolution will be carried out against them and not for their benefit.
It looks as though this might come about, provided no premature action is taken in Paris.
As was inevitable in the circumstances of the Anti-Socialist Law,37 a number of thoroughgoing philistines have been returned to the Reichstag by our people and are beginning to give themselves airs because they constitute a majority in the parliamentary group.
373 We shall now have to wait and see how far they go; they can be toler­ ated for a time if in tow, but not when in the lead.
They know that they haven't got the masses behind them, but they also know that, at the moment, the hands of the masses are very much tied.
Of one thing we may be certain.
If they gain the upper hand, I shall continue to cooperate up to a certain point, but beyond that it will be bonjour, mes­ sieurs.
a Being overwhelmed with work, I cannot unfortunately go into the attack as I should like to do, but perhaps it is a good thing to al­ low these gentlemen a little latitude.
The matter of the Steamship Subsidies342 went off pretty smoothly on the whole, after several of them had made real fools of themselves.
Now they are out for the blood of the Zurich Sozialdemokrat, 3 7 4 which is rather more serious.
For it's bad enough to be made to look a fool in the eyes of the gen­ tlemen in the Reichstag, but in the eyes of the whole of Europe — that really is a bit thick! If Bebel were in good health, none of this would matter a great deal, but he is nervy and debilitated, on top of which he has to work himself to the bone on his family's ac­ count.
But everything will come right when old William pegs out.
The Crown Princeb is a weak, irresolute fellow, as if destined for decapita­ tion, his wife0 ambitious, with a clique of her own — in short, there will be all manner of changes that will play havoc with the existing order of things and bemuse and unsettle the civil service, while the bourgeoisie will at last be compelled to clear away some of the old lumber and play a political role — as it damned well ought.
Only let the political scene at home come to life again and we shall need noth­ ing more.
But the rotten bourgeoisie has so greatly deteriorated that a good day, gentlemen -b Frederick William -c Victoria what it should do voluntarily and in its own interests as a class, it will do only under compulsion — the compulsion of the historical circum­ stances imposed upon it.
And so long as the old jackass lives, it will be under no compulsion to get moving, which is why I hope that he will kick the bucket and do so in the way of nature, thus leaving his suc­ cessor free to choose what stupidity to indulge in first.
And with this pious wish, it being almost time for the post, I shall now conclude.
Borkheim was rather less well during the winter, but has now im­ proved again, i.
e.
he's much as before.

ö first time 159 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN London, 4 April 1885 Dear Bebel, Since you happen to be at home now and I, too, am granting my­ self a bit of a holiday, I shall take advantage of the opportunity to re­ mind you of my existence.
So those gentlemen who form the majority of the parliamentary group are intent on setting themselves up as a 'power' to judge by their statement in today's Sozialdemokrat.
374 The endeavour as such is feeble, and is basically an admission of their own ineptitude.
'We are,' they say, 'annoyed by the paper's attitude; it conflicts with ours, we are to be held responsible for an opinion that is the opposite of our own, and we really don't know what to do about it.
Are we not to be pitied?' But it is their first step towards the establishment of the petty bourgeoisie as the dominant, official element in the party, and the re­ legation of the proletariat to the status of one that is barely tolerated.
How far along this road they will dare to travel remains to be seen.
If they gain control of the Sozialdemokrat, it will no longer be possible for me to vindicate the party abroad through thick and thin as single-mindedly as I have always done.
And their committee of inquiry would seem to betray a certain desire to take over the organ.
Come to that, their main grievance would seem to lie in having been com­ pelled in the end to vote against the Steamship Bill upon which they had set their hearts.
For the rest, things in general are going very well.
The year 1885 has got off to an excellent start.
In France, Ferry topples, colonial pol­ icy, dictated by stock-market speculators, collapses,372 new elections in the offing consequent upon new electoral legislation.
375 In Paris, what's more, a state of ferment, provoked by the rapacity and ineffi­ ciency of the ruling middle class and exacerbated by the infamies of the police (everything they do, however base, is condoned, provided they keep the masses at bay); we can only hope that things won't come to a head there in the form of attempted coups.
If they take a peaceful course, radicalism — i.
e.
Clemenceau — is bound to come to the helm before very long.
Should he come to power peacefully and not as the result of rioting, and thus be compelled to keep his promises and put his radical panacée into practice, the Parisian workers will quickly be cured of their belief in radicalism.
In addition, there will be the new elections consequent upon the new electoral legislation, and thus stagnation will again give way to activity.
In England, with her thoroughly effete government, 376 there will also be new elections consequent upon the new electoral legisla­ tion.
2" And in Germany, a change of monarch that may occur any day now and which, in a country as chockful of traditions as Prussia-Germany, always ushers in a new period of activity; in short, things will begin to liven up everywhere, and this on the economic basis of universal and incurable overproduction, a state of affairs that is gradually leading up to an acute crisis.
Kautsky has just arrived with a long letter from Ede about his con­ flict with the parliamentary group.
I have told Kautsky that in my view it was in fact Ede's duty to let the party at large have their say in the paper, and that the parliamentary group has no right to prevent this.
If he adopts this standpoint, the group won't be able to touch 271 him.
Secondly, he mustn't let the group press him into posing the cardinal question; to be rid of him is exactly what the chaps are after, and he could do them no greater service.
In the third place, he should not take upon himself responsibility for other people's articles unless he reserves the right to name them.
You know whom I mean and who it was that wrote most of the articles about the steamship affair—the ones that so enraged the majority and for which Ede appears to have assumed responsibility.
377 After all, he has long had to do battle with the petty-bourgeois lot; now the struggle has simply assumed a differ­ ent form, but the cause is still the same and, like you, I think it im­ probable that these gentlemen will take things to extremes, much though they would like to exploit the position the Anti-Socialist Law3 7 affords them, namely immunity to official and genuine oppo­ sition or criticism on the part of their voters.
The matter would, in my view, take a smoother course were the So­ zialdemokrat to discard the official character that has been attached to it.
Though not undesirable at one time, this no longer serves any purpose.
Whether and how such a thing can be done, you will know better than I.
25 sheets (out of 38) of Capital, Book II have been printed.
Book III is in hand.
It is quite extraordinarily brilliant.
This com­ plete reversal of all previous economics is truly astounding.
Our the­ ory is thereby provided for the first time with an unassailable basis while we ourselves are enabled to hold our own successfully against all comers.
Directly it appears, the philistines in the party will again be dealt a blow that will give them something to think about.
For it will again bring general economic questions to the forefront of the controversy.
Time for the post.
Unless I send this off, it won't leave till Mondaya and, perhaps, no longer find you at home.

I (VI), Moscow, 1932 Published in English for the first time 162 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 16-17 April 1885 My dear Laura, It has struck me, since I wrote last,a that something might be done in the matter of Lawroff s Russian friends, if they are willing to risk some money on preliminary expenses.
1) If the man died in London and the date of his death, locality, etc.
, is approximately known, these particulars might enable some one to trace the authentic record of the death.
2) Having that, it will be easy to ascertain at the Court of Probate whether there was a will proved, or whether some one, and who, took out letters of administration and appropriated the gold the man is supposed to have left.
These two steps will in any case be the first two steps that have to be taken, and will put the inquiring parties in a position where they can better judge whether it is worth while proceeding any further.
I think Percy might be entrusted with this preliminary part of the matter, and I would see that his charges are no more than what is usual.
They would depend, of course, upon the amount of trouble he would be put to.
See this volume, pp.
264-66.
How is poor old Lawroff getting on with his eyesight? It must be terrible for him to be debarred from the use of his books.
Here is another patient: old Harney has been hovering about all parts of England and Scotland ever since July last and everywhere persecuted by articular rheumatism and bad weather—and now at last turned up in London.
He has gone through all sorts of semi-quack treatments — Turkish baths, brine-baths, magnetic belts, etc.
, and all of course no use, and now has put himself again in the hands of an advertising 'specialist' who exploits the uric-acid-gout theory (which in itself is quite correct) in what looks to me an extremely quackish way.
However I'll hope the best, and the poor old fellow is much in want of it.
He is shaky enough in arms, hands, legs and feet, and of course much reduced by the treatment he has undergone.
I saw him this afternoon (he stays somewhere near the Brecknock) and he speaks of nothing but his sufferings, though here and there with a dash of his old dry humour.
His treatment has of course cost him an awful lot of money and he seems to dread the necessity of re­ turning to America.
From all this you see how much eight months of continuous pains and gradually sinking hopes of relief have brought the old chap down.
I hope the spring weather which anyhow must come sometime, will bring him at least some relief.
It's nothing but patients today.
Tussy may have informed you that Edward fell ill about 10 days ago and that Donkin says it is a calculus in the kidney — he is at Ventnor at present and rest, we hope, will al­ lay the irritation.
Of course, there are a good many people loafing about with such a thing in their kidney but it is not pleasant cer­ tainly.
The next patient is not so bad, but it is Nim, she had a severe cold, and as one could not keep her out of the kitchen, it turned into a — so far slight — attack of bronchitis.
Anyhow I got her to consult the doctor today who told her the shortest way to get over it at once was to go to bed, so there we got her with a fire in the room and 64 degrees Fahrenheit and hope she will be able to get up about Monday.
So now I have come to an end of my sick-list, it is the longest I have had for some time and a mighty pleasant subject to write about, and more pleasant still for the reader! Paul's article for Kautsky goes in German into the Neue ^eif and in a [P.

* I do not know whether you get this regularly.
The business arrangements are as usual awfully defective, everything is put upon Edward's shoulders and as he cannot super­ vise every detail, nobody knows whether the paper is really forward­ ed to all those people abroad who ought to have it.
The whole Socialist League346 is now in an awful excitement about the Afghan scare — they see not only war, but England defeated, India in revolt and last, revolution at home, Socialism triumphant — hooray! Poor Bax was going to write in this style but Tussy told him he had better see me about it, and I have done my best to cool him down a bit.
3 7 8 Whenever an Englishman does get free of Jingoism thoroughly, he seems to get a positive hatred of his own nationality.
This is not such a bad quality, only rather misplaced in the case of a war with the Russian Tsar.
b The Socialist League will not as yet set England in a blaze, but the Russian Nihilists356 may Russia — with the help of an unsuccessful war.
You will have seen the stupid proclamation of the German deputies in the Sozialdemokrat.
3 7 4 The petit-bourgeois element has decidedly got the majority among the deputies, as I feared from the beginning.
This is owing to the Socialist Law 3 7 which gives them exceptional fa­ cilities in pushing their candidatures.
But they will soon find out their mistake, if they have not already done so.
I am rather glad they have come out so soon and so stupidly.
The separation from this element which has been pushed and cajoled principally by friend Lieb­ knecht — with the usual best intentions, of course — will come, but I do not want to provoke it while the Socialist Law is in force, because that prevents us from fighting it out.
It gives these people a certain advantage but that we must put up with for the time being.
And I do not think they will push things to a crisis.
Now a word for Paul.
379 No doubt lexc is derived from legered and v6(j.

And this cannot be otherwise.

That this is confirmed by the development of the language, rien de plus naturel.

Etymology like physiology and any other -ology must be learned, cannot be invented.

381 That the law of wages being in inverse proportion to the length of working time should also be verified in Russia is a very interesting fact indeed.
So also is the rapid disintegration of the Mipi>a by the progress of modern industry and financing, as shown in the increasing number of the 6e3xo3HÖCTBeHHbie xo3aeBa.
b All such facts are of the highest importance to me, and I shall feel very much obliged if you will communicate to me, from time to time, what you may know about the economical condition and development of your great coun­ try.
Unfortunately at present all my time is taken up with the publi­ cation of the manuscripts, c so much so that I have to interrupt not only independent work but even my studies, and can scarcely find a (Russ.
) rural community -b (Russ.
) farmless peasants -c of the third volume of Capital time for correspondence; so you see I cannot take advantage just now of your kind offer to send me original Russian works on economical subjects, I should really not have the time to make use of them.
But I hope you will not blame me, if hereafter at the first opportunity I take the liberty of reminding you of your kind promise.
In the meantime these inestimable manuscripts are to me a source of the highest scientific Genuss,3 and no doubt so will the proofs be to you.

I dic­ tate from the original, which is positively illegible to any living man except myself, and shall have no rest until it is all transferred to a manuscript which at all events will be legible to others.
Then I can take my time with the final redaction, which will be no easy task, see­ ing the imperfect state of the original.
But anyhow, even if I should not be spared to finish that, it would be saved from being utterly lost, and could be published as it is in case of need.
This No.
Ill is the most astounding thing I ever read, and it is a thousand pities that the au­ thor did not live to work it out and publish it himself and see the effect it is destined to create.
After this lucid exposition, no candid opposi­ tion is any longer possible.
The most difficult points are cleared up and disentangled as if they were a mere child's play, and the whole system acquires a new and simple aspect.
I am afraid this No.

Below you will find the reasons for my tardiness, which can certainly not be at­ tributed to idleness on my part.
You ask me to give you my opinion of Plekhanov's book Hauiu pa.
3-Hoejiacin.
a To do this I should have to have read it.
I find little diffi­ culty in reading Russian when I have spent a week devoting myself to it, but six months or more may go by without my having any oppor­ tunity to do so; then, having lost the habit of it, I am compelled to learn the language all over again, as it were.
And that is what has happened with the Pamozjiacin,.
Marx's manuscripts, which I dictate to a secretary,b take up the whole of my day; in the evening people come to call who cannot, after all, simply be shown the door.
Also there are proofs to be read, a great deal of correspondence and, fi­ nally, translations (into the Italian, Danish, etc.
) of my Origin etc.
,c which I am asked to look over and whose revision sometimes turns out to be neither easy nor superfluous.
Well, all these interruptions have prevented my progressing further than page 60 of the Pa,3Hozjia-cin.
If only I could have three days to myself, the job would be done and, what is more, I should have brushed up my Russian.
However, the little I have read is, I think, enough to put me more or less au fait with the dispute d in question.
To begin with, let me repeat how proud I am to know that there exists among the younger generation in Russia a party which frankly and unreservedly accepts the great economic and historical theories evolved by Marx, and which has broken for good with all the anar­ chic and to some extent Slavophil traditions of its predecessors.
383 And Marx himself, had he lived a little longer, would have been no less proud than I.
It marks a step forward which will be of the utmost a See this volume, p.

importance to the revolutionary development of Russia.
In my eyes, Marx's historical theory is fundamentally essential to revolutionary tactics, if these are to be consistent and logical; to discover what those tactics ought to be, all one has to do is to apply the theory to eco­ nomic and political conditions in the country concerned.
But to do so demands familiarity with those conditions, and I, for my part, am too ignorant of the present situation in Russia to suppose myself competent to assess in detail the tactics that might be required at any given moment.
Again, the internal and intimate history of the Russian revolutionary party, in particular that of the last few years, is to me a closed book.
My friends among the Narodnaya Volya mem­ bers have never discussed it with me.
Yet this is an element which, if one is to form an opinion, cannot be ignored.
What I know, or believe I know, of the situation in Russia leads me to think that that country is nearing its 1789.
Revolution is bound to break out some time or other; it may break out any day.
In conditions such as these the country is like a charged mine, all that is needed is to apply the match.
Especially after what happened on 13 March.
188 It is one of those special cases where it is possible for a handful of men to effect a revolution, that is, to bring about at one stroke the collapse of an entire system whose equilibrium is more than labile (to use Ple-khanov's metaphora),384 and to release, by a single and intrinsically insignificant act, explosive forces which later become uncontrollable.
Well, if ever Blanquism, the fantasy of subverting the whole of a so­ ciety through action by a small group of conspirators, had any ra­ tional foundation, it would assuredly be in St Petersburg.
b Once the match has been applied to the powder, once the forces have been un­ leashed and the national energy has been converted from potential to kinetic (another of Plekhanov's favourite and, indeed, excellent met­ aphors) 385 — the men who have sprung the mine will be swept off their feet by an explosion a thousand times more powerful than they themselves, one which will seek whatever outlet it may find in accor­ dance with the prevailing economic forces and resistances.
Suppose that these men imagine they will be able to seize power, what of it? Providing they make the hole which causes the dam to col­ lapse, the resulting torrent of water will soon put paid to their illusions.
But what if those illusions succeeded in endowing them with an ex-" The draft had 'pet metaphor'.
-b Crossed out in the draft: 'I do not say "in Russia" because in the provinces, far from the administrative centre, it [such action] is not necessary.
' 281 ceptional strength of will? Would that be any cause for complaint? Men who have boasted of having effected a revolution have always found on the morrow that they didn't know what they were doing; that once effected, the revolution has borne no resemblance at all to what they had intended.
That is what Hegel calls the irony of histo­ ry,3 8 6 an irony which few historical 4Ï.
HTCAH a can escape.
b You have only to look at Bismarck, a revolutionary in spite of himself, and Gladstone, who ended up by falling out with his beloved Tsar.
c What, in my view, is important in Russia is that the impulse should be given, that revolution should break out.
Whether it is this or that group that gives the signal, whether it be under this flag or that, is of little concern to me.
Even if it wered a palace plot, its instigators would be swept away on the morrow.
In a place where the situation is so tense, where revolutionary elements have accumulated to such a degree, where the economic situation of the vast mass of the people becomes daily more impossible, where every degree of social develop­ ment is represented, from the primitive commune to modern big industry and high finance, and where all these contradictions are forci­ bly pent up by an unheard-of despotism — a despotism increasingly unacceptable to a younger generation in which are combined the na­ tion's intelligence and dignity — in such a place 1789, once launched, will before long be followed by 1793.

166 ENGELS TO RICHARD STEGEMANN IN TÜBINGEN [Draft] [London,] 5 May 1885 Dear Sir, Mature reflection has shown that I cannot possibly comply with your request.
387 Either the work you want must be short, in which case it could contain nothing but asseverations on my part, and thus merely be assertive and belletristic.
Or I should have to supply documentary evidence, in which case it would turn into a book, and that would not suit your purpose; more­ over, I could not write it in so off-hand and casual a manner, for which my material is far too abundant.
A further consideration is that I should be more or less committing myself to co-editing a work about which I know nothing save the brief account provided by you.
In addition, the thing would — within the limits prescribed — be utterly useless.
However vigorous my protestations, they would utter­ ly fail to move the semi-educated vulgarian whose prejudices you wish to combat.
People who say that Marx 'died friendless' must, pre­ sumably, harbour the belief that I do not exist at all.
In which case, what magical effect could asseverations on my part be expected to have? The old fairy-tales invented by the vulgar democratic emigra­ tion of 1850-59, and further elaborated by Bonaparte's paid agent, Karl Vogt, — il lui a été remis en 1859 a 40,000 frs, according to the Tuileries papers, 388 may perhaps be more in vogue in your district than elsewhere because the Swabian People's Party203 is the direct descendant of that same democratic emigration, certain of its leaders having been on intimate terms with the afore-mentioned Vogt.
Since all this was dealt with by Marx in Herr Vogt, there would seem to be in 1859 he was paid no reason for me to hark back to it at this particular juncture.
Vast numbers of lies were told about Marx to which he never saw fit to re­ ply.
The time may, perhaps, come when it will behove me to do so on his behalf, but the choice of time, place and modus operandi will be my affair.
Which will, of course, only serve to revive my reputation for 'callousness'.
In any case, I haven't got time just now to do anything along these lines that would either be to the purpose or satisfy my own require­ ments in regard to such a work.
My entire time is taken up with editing Marx's manuscripts, and I shall be acting wholly in his spirit if, in view of this obligation, I treat all this philistine carping with contempt.
I remain, Sir, very sincerely First published in: Marx and Engels, Printed according to the original Works, First Russian Edition, Vol.
XXVII, Moscow 1935 Published in English for the first time 167 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN IN ZURICH London, 15 May 1885 Dear Ede, I think it's about time to drop you a line or two again, otherwise you will grow far too melancholy.
You and Kautsky seem to evoke from one another so many doleful laments that a complete concert in the minor key could be produced therefrom; it's like the trombone in Wagner that always sounds forth whenever something dire is going to happen.
Each time you get bad news, the pair of you always forget the old adage about a dog's back being worse than its bite.
The general and inescapable impression left by the whole shindy between 'parliamentary group and editors' is that the parliamentary group have made fools of themselves.
And should the parliamentary group insist on doing it again, they ought not to be prevented.
Had you immediately published the first written communication,389 as they demanded, they would have made complete and utter fools of themselves, and a 'storm of indignation' would have broken out on all sides.
Not, of course, that this could very well have been asked of you at the start, but there can be no doubt at all that it is not in our inter­ ests to prevent the parliamentary group from showing themselves in their true colours.
As things are, 'parliamentary group and editors' confront each other as equals — in the eyes of the public—, this being the result of the last, lengthy middle-of-the-road statement,390 and what happens next, we shall have to see.
I had Singer here on Sunday,a and cut short all his speechifying.
The parliamentary group's first statement, he said, was directed not so much against the articles in the paper,377 as against the (alleged) attempt to try and arouse a storm of indignation against the parlia­ mentary group.
That, I said, was something the public couldn't have known; if you make a public statement, it can only refer to publicly available facts.
But if you hit out at the paper on account of things that have never appeared in it, the public may justifiably ask: 'What are these gentlemen after, if not the suppression of free speech?' This he had to admit.
Next I said that, to judge by what was to me a very familiar style, most of the objectionable articles had been by Lieb­ knecht.
— Singer: 'Quite right, and we gave Liebknecht a proper dressing-down for it in the parliamentary group.
' I: 'But to censure the paper in public for printing things that actually emanated from the parliamentary group simply won't do.
You ought to have settled the matter amongst yourselves.
Instead, you publicly attack the edi­ tors for matters that are solely the private concern of the parliamen­ tary group.
To whom, then, are the editors to look?' Here again he could raise no objection.
'In short, you have, by your ill-considered action, made fools of yourselves, and if anyone has come off best in the eyes of the public, it is the editors.
' This, too, he had to concede indirectly.
Since I stuck to the main points and disregarded all his personal tittle-tattle, of which he had ample store, we concluded our business in ten minutes.
That's not the end of the matter, of course.
But we now know what the gentlemen's weak side is.
If I were editor of the Sozialdemokrat, I should, from the editorial point of view, let the parliamentary group 10 May stew in its own juice, i.
e.
in the Reichstag, entrust any criticism thereof to the members of the party, on the strength of the oft-cited 'free expression of opinion', and tell Liebknecht once and for all that he must himself be answerable to the parliamentary group for his ar­ ticles, thus putting an end to his double-dealing, in this respect at any rate.
Then, provided the paper continues to be edited along the lines already laid down, that is enough for us.
It is far more important for us to maintain our theoretical standpoint in the face of the rubbish that is printed in Germany than to criticise the parliamentary group's mode of action.
For after all, those who have been elected are them­ selves doing everything in their power to enlighten the electorate as to the character of the elected.
And for that matter, day to day events provide opportunity enough to make clear what our standpoint is, even if we leave it to the parliamentary group and party members to take care of the parliamentary group.
It is, however, that very stand­ point that vexes them most of all, and it is something they dare not publicly attack.
The Reichstag will soon be going home.
In the meantime the gen­ tlemen— although almost all of them are secret protectionists — will have seen what havoc is wrought by a policy of protective tariffs.
391 That is but the first of many disappointments that lie in store for them.
Not that it will change their philistine character, but it will probably shake their confidence and cause them to fall out over phi­ listine questions that necessitate their declaring themselves for or against.
Only give such types a little rope, and they'll hang them­ selves.
In short, our policy is, I believe, to temporise.
The Anti-Socialist Law37 is working in their favour and if, while it remains in force, they can only find an opportunity to show themselves in their true colours, that is really all we need for the present.
In the meantime we must defend every position to the utmost, particularly in the press, and.
this will not always call for active resistance.
To outflank an enemy is also a defensive manoeuvre but one that has offensive con­ notations.
At the moment we have much against us.
Bebel is ill and has, so it seems, lost heart.
Nor shall I be able to help as much as I would like until I have finished with Marx's manuscripts.
So you and Kautsky must bear the brunt of the battle.
But don't forget the old rule — never to allow the actualities of the movement and of the struggle to make you forget the movement's future.
And that belongs 286 to us.
The third volume of Capital will do in all these chaps at one blow.

Other songs of that time are to be found in anthologies of folk songs, Des Knaben Wunderhorn* etc.
You might perhaps find something there.
But even at that time the Landsknecht^ exercised a virtual monopoly over our popular poetry.
Of foreign songs, the only one I know is the beautiful old Danish song about Herr Tidmann, which I translated for the Berlin Social-Demokrat in 1865.
c There were all kinds of Chartist songs, but they are now no longer to be had.

I don't know how it goes on.
All that stuff has been forgotten and in any case wasn't up to much as poetry.
In 1848 two popular songs were current and were sung to the same tune.
1) Schleswig-Holstein.
2) The Hecker song395: Hecker, may thy name resound Up and down the German Rhine, Thy generous heart nay, e'en thy look Inspired confidence in mind.
Hecker, a German man and free Who'd give his life for liberty.
That, I think, suffices.
Then there's another version: Hecker, Struve, Blenker, Zitz and Blum Slay the German princes.
In general, the poetry of past revolutions (always excepting the Marseillaise396) seldom has much revolutionary impact later on because, if it is to influence the masses, it must reflect the mass preju­ dices of the day — hence the religious nonsense found even in the Chartists.
Now as to Marx's shorter pieces, this is a matter upon which others beside myself have to decide, while I for my own part must make quite sure that nothing is done that might interfere with the proposed edition of the Complete Works.
The things appertaining to the Inter­ national, the Inaugural Address, Civil War, Hague Report,3 etc.
, like the Manifesto^1 I do not regard as forming part of these, though I should like to reserve the right to provide a few words of introduction.
As re­ gards the articles from the Neue Rheinische Reifung, you must first find out which were written by Marx.
For instance, only one, an out­ standing article on the June insurrection was by Marx, 0 while the account of the struggle, etc.
, was entirely mine.
d Likewise the anti-Bakunin and anti-Pan-Slavism articles.
e The things Marx and I wrote at that time are on the whole almost indistinguishable owing to our systematic division of labour.

Brousse at the head of a daily paper would be too comical, he would never last.
It would be all he needed to cut his own throat.
The idea that life is simply the normal mode of existence of albu­ minous bodies and that as a result the protein of the future, if the chemists ever contrive to manufacture it, must display signs of life, appears in my anti-Dühring book where it is developed to some extent on page 60, etc.
b By assuming responsibility for it Schorlemmer did a bold thing, for if it falls flat, the blame will be his, whereas if it catches on, he will be the first to give me the credit.
398 Moreover your Grimaux must be an imbecile if he really said that 'we have nothing to show us how this initial movement is acquired whereby an al­ buminoid is organised into a living cell' .
c So the good man appears to be unaware that there is a whole army of living things which are still very far removed from the organisation of a cell, being no more than 'plasson', as Haeckel has it,d albumi­ noids that have no trace of organisation, yet are alive — for example protamoebas, siphonales, etc.
The poor albuminoid has probably worked for millions of years in order to organise itself into a cell.
But your Grimaux doesn't even see the point at issue.
Moreover he betrays his ignorance of physiology still further by comparing with a primitive protoplasm, the source of all life on earth, a product as specialised as the egg of a vertebrate.

-g of the first volume of Capital (see Note 56) sections 3" are going to give me a fine old time.
The one on bank cap­ ital and credit is in such disorder as to strike terror into the heart of a better man than me, but that is how it is.
I am now at land rent.
It is quite superbly done.
But this will entail even more work, for the manuscript dates from 1865 and I shall have to consult his extracts made between 1870 and 1878 both for the banks and for landed property in America and Russia.
And there are not a few of them.
This means that the 3rd volume will have to wait another year at least.
The storm in a teacup that has disrupted our ranks in Germany 374 will doubtless calm down for the time being.
Now that the Reichstag has been sent about its business, the gents of the 'socialist group' have dispersed.
The Social Democrats have won a moral victory over the 'group'.
But that is not the end of the matter and there may be a re­ currence.
Were it not for the Anti-Socialist Law,37 I should have been in favour of an outright split.
But so long as it is in force, it de­ prives us of all our weapons while enabling the party's petit-bourgeois section to reap all the benefit.
And, in any case, it is not our business to provoke it.
The thing was inevitable; it was bound to come sooner or later.
But it would have come either later or under circumstances more favourable to ourselves had it not been for the incredible stupid­ ities of Liebknecht, who has not only wavered between the two sec­ tions and invariably protected the petit bourgeois, but has also been prepared on more than one occasion to sacrifice the proletarian na­ ture of the party for a simulacrum of unity that is credible to no one.
It would appear that his own protégés, the representatives of the pe­ tit-bourgeois side, have now had enough of his double dealing.
Lieb­ knecht always believes what he says when he is saying it, but believes something quite different whenever he speaks to someone else.
Over here he is all for revolution, over there all for circumspection.
That won't prevent his being on our side on the crucial day and telling us: Didn't I always tell you so! This is between ourselves.
A kiss for Laura.

I sent you, by registered mail, the translation3 with my comments.
I am very sorry that my limited practice of Italian has not enabled me to do them better, but I hope they will be intelligible nonetheless.
I am amazed that, without having lived in Germany and learned the language there, you have been able to render my thoughts so well.
I only found a few abbreviated, idiomatic and proverbial expressions where there was an error; and even these are impossible to understand properly for someone who has not spoken the everyday language and even the dialects of the country--things which are not to be found in grammars and dictionaries.
And in sev­ eral cases when you have understood the meaning well, I think you could be a little freer and more adventurous.
I fear that the note about 'Mark' is not very clear.
It is the only note which I think should be printed.
The others are for your infor­ mation only.
If therefore you have any doubts about that note, please let me know and I shall try and rewrite it.
401 Please excuse the long time it has taken me to do the revision.
But my days are taken up with dictating Marx's manuscripts, and my evenings are not always free.
In addition, I have had a Danish trans­ lation b to check at the same time, not to mention the English transla­ tion of Capital.
56 Thanking you again for the considerable work you have done on my behalf, I remain Your devoted Printed according to the original Translated from the Italian Published in English for the first time a the Italian translation of Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State -b of The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State First published in: Marx and Engels, Works, First Russian Edition, Vol.
XXVII, Moscow, 1935 171 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 29 May 1885 My dear Laura, So then at least one thing is settled, and that is poor Paul in his Kittchen* in Ste Pélagie.
402 Hope it will not be for four months — the four best of the year too! Anyhow, what a consolation it is for him, to be no longer crucified between the braconnier b on one side and the vol avec effraction (de puanteur) c on the other! And to consider it a hard-fought victory that he can have his old Kittchen again in company with a spouting anarchist.
Well let us hope Révillon and a few more deputies will make it hot for the Liberal ministry and procure his re­ lease.
Harney is gone to Macclesfield yesterday, and arrived safely.
He is a good deal better, intrinsically, but of course the pains do not go all at once, and as soon as he is a bit better, he begins stirring about in cabs; he did so for two days before he left, then the journey, and of course arrived worse.
I am afraid he will never get quite over it, part­ ly because the complaint is too inveterate and partly on account of his inconsistency and listening to everybody who has a remedy to propose.
It has been a hard time for poor Nim, and I am glad for her sake it has come to an end.
Sam Moore had to go to Pumps', I think he rather liked it this time as he was bent on exhibitions, picture galleries, Royal Academies and the like, and so he and Pumps have a fine time of it.
Today they are gone to see a cricket match at Lords.
d I had this morning the last proof-sheet of my preface to Second Vol­ ume," so from that you see that the report of its being out is another canard.
You may be sure that as soon as it is out and we get copies, you have one sent the same day.
The 3rd edition of the 18th Brumaire 1 is in the press, two sheets printed.
a jail (slang) -b poacher -c burglar (stinking) -d Lords Cricket Ground in Lon­ don -e of Capital -l K.
Marx, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.
The Italian translation of the Ursprung is also in the press.
But you will at once see that it will be hardly possible to translate from that into French.
403 If Paul uses it merely to facilitate to him the compre­ hension of the original, well and good; otherwise it would only enable him to give a very enfeebled Abklatsch* and poor rechauffé, h and I have no ambition to appear before the French public in that shape.
The man c has done his best and some passages are really good.
But it is not to be expected from him, who learnt German without assis­ tance in Bénevento, that he should put idiomatic German into equally idiomatic Italian.
And that defect I could not remedy, as my idiomatic Italian is not Italian but only Milanese, and that, too, nearly forgotten.
I hope there will not be much more ofthat fighting about red flags, etc.
, in Paris — the police want a few barricades, and if they get them, there will be a jolly massacre — the people have not a ghost of a chance of victory.
404 Even if the government should show hesita­ tion, the reactionary military chiefs will take care to be ready for ac­ tion and to act.
There is one consolation for Paul — that he will be virtually 'out of Paris' on the day of the French Grand Old Man'sd funeral.
What with proof-sheet, and writing to Harney 3 9 and making par­ cels up for him and writing to a confectioner from Colmare 3 9 who asked my advice as to his finding work in London (answer: certainly not) and one thing and another, it has become 5.
20, and so I must close if I want to catch this post.
So with hopes that Paul will not be too unhappy, nor too long where he is, and that you will keep up, in spite of all, your state of, in Paris, abnormal health, here is the conclu­ sion.
Love from Nim.
Yours affectionately, F.

361 To-day I forward 27/33, the conclusion.
In a few days I hope to be able to send you the preface, etc.
From that preface you will see that the ms.
of Volume III has been written as early as 1864/66, and thus before the period when the author, thanks to your kindness, became so intimately acquainted with the agricultural system of your coun­ try: I am at present working at the chapter on the rent of land, and have so far not found any allusion to Russian conditions.
406 As soon as the whole manuscript shall have been transcribed into a legible handwriting, I shall have to work it out by comparison with what other materials have been left by the author, and there are, for the chapter on rent, very voluminous extracts from the various statistical works he owed to you — but whether these will contain any critical notes that can be made use of for this volume, I cannot as yet tell.
Whatever there is, shall be used most conscientiously.
At all events the mere work of transcription will occupy me far into autumn, and as the manuscript is nearly 600 pages in folio, it may again have to be divided into two volumes.
The analysis of rent is theoretically so complete that you will neces­ sarily find therein a good deal of interest for the special conditions of your country.
Still this ms.
excludes the treatment of the pre-capitalistic forms of landed property; they are merely alluded to here and there for the sake of comparison.
Yours very sincerely, P.

The Gronlunds and Elys,a as also the newspapers, gratefully received.
Ely is a well-meaning philistine and does at least take more trouble than his German fellow-sufferers and fellow-blockheads which, after all, deserves recognition.
Gron-lund, on the other hand, strikes me as being speculative: his boosting of our stuff, in so far as he does or does not understand it, is clearly aimed at palming off his own Utopian fiddle-faddle as REAL LIVE GERMAN SOCIALISM.
A symptom at any rate.
As regards To-Days and Commonweals, I am sending you the former from March onwards and the latter from the beginning.
b However their administrative side is not particularly efficient; should the paper [The Commonweal) fail to reach the Sozialist regularly, I should be very grateful if you would advise me so that I can provide proof of inefficiency, this being invariably denied by the secretary, though it undoubtedly exists.
You would do best to ignore Fabian completely; the man feels a need to get himself talked about and there is no necessity to en­ courage that.
c His chief grievance against me is that I maliciously defamed V— 1 in the Anti-Diihring, a point on which he complained to Marx by letter.
209 You have had the same correct presentiment about the Reichstag laddies as I have — the case of the Steamship Subsidies342 has re­ vealed the immensity of their philistine aspirations.
It almost came to a split, which would not be desirable at present, so long as the Anti-Socialist Law 37 remains in force.
As soon as we get a bit more ELBOW-ROOM in Germany, the split will doubtless come and can then only do a L.

A petty-bourgeois-socialist parliamentary group is inevitable in a country like Germany where philistinism, even more than historical right, 'doesn't have no date'.
408 It will also be useful once it has con­ stituted itself a body separate from the proletarian party.
However such a split could only do harm just now if it were provoked by us.
But if they do in fact renounce the programme, so much the better; we shall then be able to let fly.
You in America also suffer from various great savants of the kind possessed by Germany's philistine socialists in the persons of Geiser, Frohme, Bios, etc.
The historical digressions in the Sozialist by your Stiebelings, Douais, etc.
, on the subject of Völkerwanderung a amused me greatly, for these people have studied the whole thing far better and far more thoroughly than I have.
Douai, in particular, gives himself colossal airs.
For instance in No.
13 of the Sozialist, apropos the German conquests in Italy, etc.
, he tells us that the King acquired '/3 of the land and the officers and soldiers 2/3, of which 2/3 passed in turn to the former slaves, etc.
' This we learn from Jornandes and Cas-siodorus.
' 40Q When I read that I was completely bowled over.
'Pre­ cisely similar accounts,' he goes on, 'are provided about the Visigoths.
Nor was it otherwise in France.
' Well, the whole thing is an invention from start to finish and you won't find a word of it either in Jornandes or in Cas-siodorus or in any other contemporary source.
It reveals at once colossal ig­ norance and impudence to confront me with such utter rubbish and to say that I am 'demonstrably in the wrong'.
The sources, and I know practically all of them, state precisely the opposite.
I have let it pass this time, as it was written in America where one can hardly make an issue of that kind of thing.
But Monsieur Douai had better watch out in future; I might well lose patience some day.
The 2nd volume of Capital will be out shortly; all I am awaiting is the last half proof-sheet of the preface where Rodbertus receives a further broadside.
The 3rd book is going ahead merrily, but will take a long time.
Not that that matters, as the 2nd volume must be di­ gested first.
The 2nd volume will cause great disappointment, being a purely scientific work with little in the way of agitation.
By contrast the third volume will again have the effect of a thunderbolt, since the II G.

whole of capitalist production is dealt with in context for the first time and all official bourgeois economics rejected out of hand.
But it will be quite a task.
Since the New Year I have dictated more than half of the final version and expect to finish this preliminary work in about 4 months.
But after that there will be the actual job of editing, which won't be easy as the most important chapters are in some disorder — so far as form is concerned.
However everything will work out all right, though it will take time.
As you can imagine, I shall have to leave everything else on one side until I have finished, and hence neglect my correspondence; nor can there be any question of writing articles.
But you would oblige me if you would see to it that nothing of what I have said about the 3rd volume gets into the Sozialist.
That would inevitably give rise to unpleasantnesses in Zurich and else­ where.
Whatever the readers need to know will appear in my preface to the 2nd volume.
All is well with Tussy so far.
The two of thema are very happy to­ gether, though unfortunately they are not always in good health.
Lafargue must now do another 4 months on account of the same old fine and costs.
402 The police were intent on fomenting a riot in Paris on 24 May, but nothing came of it and the ministers took fright.
404 So the Victor Hugo business went off quietly after all, and that is just as well.
As there is no Garde Nationale, no weapons are to be had and any attempted coup would inevitably be crushed.
One just has to adapt one's tactics to the circumstances.

However the time will doubtless come when the likes of us will again be able to travel about untroubled by too great a pressure of work or the harassments of the continental po­ lice.
Then I shall pack my bags and pay you a visit.
Meanwhile the world goes very gently on its way, though it may well speed up a bit shortly.

That is why he has now des­ patched Frederick Charles to carry out an inspection.

You are quite right, radicalism in France is rapidly becoming more and more threadbare.
There is only one man left who has yet to be­ come so and that is Clemenceau.
If he gets in he'll shed a whole mass of illusions, above all the illusion that nowadays a bourgeois republic can govern in France without thieving and causing others to thieve.
It is just possible that he will then go further.
But that is not neces­ sary.
All that is necessary is that this last sheet-anchor of the bour­ geoisie should show what he is capable of— which, given his present point of view, is nothing.
Here in England the cause is progressing pretty well, even if not in the form that is customary at home.
Since 1848 the English parlia­ ment has unquestionably been the most revolutionary body in the world and the next elections will mark the beginning of a new epoch, even though it may not necessarily manifest itself as quickly as all that.
a Workers will appear in Parliament in growing numbers, each one worse than the last.
But that is necessary over here.
All the scoun­ drels who at the time of the International played at being bourgeois-radical philistines must appear in Parliament for what they are.
Whereupon the masses will become socialist here too.
Industrial over­ production will do the rest.
The rumpus in the German party came as no surprise to me.
374 In a philistine country like Germany the party must also have a philis-tine 'educated' right wing3 7 3 which it will shed when the time comes.
In Germany philistine socialism dates back to 1844 and was criticised in the Communist Manifesto.
It is as immortal as your German philis­ tine himself.
So long as the Anti-Socialist Law 3 7 remains in force, I am not in favour of our provoking a split, since there is no parity of weapons.
Should these gentlemen, however, themselves bring about a split by attempting to suppress the proletarian nature of the party and replace it with a crudely aesthetic form of sentimental philanthropy a See this volume, p.

301 without guts or substance, then we shall just have to take it as it comes.
I am still engaged in dictating the third volume of Capital.
It is a magnificent book and as a work of science puts even the first one in the shade.
As soon as I have it in a ms.
other people can also read, I shall be able to devote some time to sorting the papers.
I shall then look out your things.
126 Until that time — round about the autumn — I shall have absolutely no chance to turn my hand to anything else.
The second volume has been printed and I shall probably be able to send you a copy in a fortnight or so.
Marx's daughters have been keeping well so far.
Mme Lafargue's husband is back in jail for another 4 months (for non-payment of a fine), 402 while Mrs Aveling is working hard at propaganda over here, though it may be some time before there is any great success.
I have taken out another five pound money order for you, of which you have doubtless already been advised.
I trust it will prove wel­ come.
Well then, take care of your health so that you can join in the litüe bit of fun that is bound to come pretty soon.

Though I am sorry that it is the Hamburgers who have done it; be­ cause this is intended as a bribe for Liebknecht, to induce him to take their side (the kleinbürgerliche Seite*) in the present storm in a — pot now going on amongst the German parliamentarians.

If the Socialist Law 37 was abolished and we had elbow-room, and if the 3rd book of the Kapital was finished I should not care a bit to have it out at once.
As it is, I am for a temporising policy.
But the split will come some day, and then we shall give the Spiessbürger f the necessary kick.

If you wish to republish one or both, it could be quite effective, and I should write you a foreword to it.
416 See this volume, p.

-goose-step -c Will 2) It might also be a good thing to republish the Communist Trial*; for one thing, it will once again show the old Lassalleans that some­ thing was already afoot in Germany before the great Ferdinand'sb time and, for another, the proceedings of the Prussians did, in fact, even then set the pattern for what the Anti-Socialist Law 37 has now made the norm.
A prefacec will be available for this as well, the mo­ ment printing is actually in progress; unfortunately my time does not permit me to work in advance and Qn spec.
Again, I haven't got a copy of the Leipzig edition with Marx's later notes.
d It is typical of the way they used then to conduct their affairs that neither Marx nor I should ever have been sent a copy! Do you have in your archives Stieber and Wermuth, Die Communis-ten-V er schwörungen des 19.
Jahrhunderts 1" (Berlin, Hayn, 1853, 2 parts) — the so-called 'black book'? It contains two addresses from the Central Committee to the League f which you might print as an appendix.
3) If I understand you aright, you are thinking of publishing the series of articles from the Neue Rheinische Leitung on the Paris battle in June 1848.
g 41 ' It's not a bad idea.
I could arrange the relevant pas­ sages for you, interspersed with a few notes to provide a context, and also whatever is needed from Marx's article in the Revue der Neuen Rheinischen Zeitung^ etc.
Being the only contemporary account of the Paris proletariat's battle to take the side of the June fighters, the thing has a certain importance.
Nor can the masses be reminded too often of the event.
But it's a task that would take at least a week, and I cannot embark on it until the autumn.
4) Various other things from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung might fol­ low, but just now I simply haven't got the time to look them out; if you could make some suggestions, we might be able to see.
The same applies to other, lesser works of that period by Marx and myself.

Only then shall I once more obtain a general idea of what is in fact available and be able to look out some suitable stuff.
Up till then I shall be more or less working in the dark.
So long as the dictation of Capital, Book III remains incomplete, my days will be taken up from 10-5, while in the evenings, apart from visitors, I not only have to deal with an ever-increasing volume of correspondence, but also to read over what I have dictated, in addition to revising the French, Italian, Danish and English translations of our things (includ­ ing the English one of Capital56), and how, I should like to know, am I to find time for anything else? Hence — as you must realise — I cannot let myself in for anything, unless it is of the utmost urgency.
Besides the afore-mentioned edition of the Communist Trial, I would ask you to send me: 3 copies of Marx's Wage Labour and Capital.
6 Communist Manifestos, Zurich edition, and charge them up to me.

W.
Dear Bebel, I hasten to answer your letter of the 19th, received this morning, so that my reply may reach you before you set off on your long journey.
Marx's manuscripts 180.
Engels to Bebel.
22-24 June 1885 307 Generally speaking I have been kept informed about recent events, at least so far as public pronouncements are concerned, and have thus been able to read the various effronteries of Geiser and Frohme, as also your short, trenchant replies.
412 All this mud-slinging is largely attributable to Liebknecht, with his predilection for educated know-alls and for men in bourgeois occupa­ tions who can be used to impress your philistine.
Nor can he resist a literary or business man who flirts with socialism.
But in Germany these are the very people of whom one should most beware, and it is they whom Marx and I have ceaselessly combatted since 1845.
Once you've let them into the party, in which they everywhere push them­ selves, to the fore, dissimulation becomes the rule, either because their petty-bourgeois standpoint is in perpetual conflict with that of the proletarian masses, or because they try to vitiate this latter stand­ point.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that, if things ever really come to a head, Liebknecht will be on our side,— asserting, what's more, that he had never said anything else and that it was we who had stopped him from letting fly any sooner.
However, a little object-lesson will have done him no harm.
The split will come as sure as eggs is eggs, but I still maintain that we must not provoke it while the Anti-Socialist Law3 7 -is in opera­ tion.
If it is forced upon us, then there'll be nothing for it.
But we must be prepared.
And that, I think, means hanging on for all we're worth to three positions: 1) the Zurich press and bookshop, 2) the management of the Sozialdemokrat and 3) that of the Neue 2jeit.
These are the only positions still in our hands and, notwithstanding the Anti-Socialist Law, they suffice to keep us in touch with the party.
All the other positions in the press, though held by philistines, count for very little by comparison with these three.
You should be able to foil many of the plots against us.
In my opinion, you ought to do everything you can to ensure that, by hook or by crook, these 3 posi­ tions remain in our hands.
How to set about it you will know better than I.
Not surprisingly Ede and Kautsky feel very insecure in their editorial seats and are in need of encouragement.
That people are busily intriguing against them is obvious.
And they're a couple of com-petent.
and really first-rate chaps.
In matters of theory, Ede is a very clear-sighted man and, what's more, is witty and has a gift for repar­ tee, but he is still somewhat lacking in self-confidence — nowadays a most unusual trait and, if you consider the megalomania common to even the most insignificant lettered nitwits, a very fortunate one, 308 180.
Engels to Bebel.
22-24 June 1885 relatively speaking.
Kautsky has picked up a frightful lot of rubbish at university but is doing his utmost to unlearn it again, and both men are reliable, able to tolerate honest criticism and have a correct grasp of essentials.
In view of the appalling new generation of literati that has attached itself to the party, two such people are pearls beyond price.
I entirely agree with what you say about our parliamentary repre­ sentation generally and about the impossibility — in time of peace, as at present — of creating any really proletarian representation.
The necessarily more or less bourgeois parliamentarians are an evil no less unavoidable than the professional agitators foisted upon the party from amongst those workers boycotted by the bourgeoisie and hence unemployed.
This was a phenomenon already strongly in evidence among the Chartists during the 1839-48 period, and was apparent to me even at that time.
If remuneration for deputies is introduced, these fellows will range themselves alongside the predominantly bourgeois and petty-bourgeois, i.
e.
the 'educated', representatives.
But all this will be overcome.
My confidence in our proletariat is as absolute as my mistrust of the utterly abject German philistines is un­ limited.
And when things liven up a bit, the struggle will similarly be­ come keen enough to be conducted con amore? while the irritation caused by the pettiness and philistinism with which you now have to contend en détail and with which I am familiar from long experience, will evaporate in the wider dimensions of the struggle and then, too, we shall get the right sort of men in parliament.
But it's all very well for me to talk — I'm over here, while you are having to do the dirty work, and that is certainly no joke.
Anyhow, I am glad that you are physically fit again.
Spare your nerves for better times; we shall need them.
The greater part of Capital, Book III, has now been dictated from the manuscripts and set out in a legible hand.
This preliminary work will be pretty well complete in 5 or 6 weeks' time.
Then there will be the very difficult final editing which will require a considerable amount of work.
But the thing's brilliant and will have all the impact of a thunderbolt.
I daily await the first copies of Book II,b one of which will instantly be forwarded to you.

Nor can I accept any respon­ sibility, either in my own or Marx's name, for the French programme as a whole b the very nature of which meant thatc we were at most act­ ing in an advisory capacity.
I can, however, tell you in confidence, that the Preamble of the programme of the Parti ouvrier, of the Roanne trend, originated with Marx.

mitation of female labour, this is because in French industry, more especially in Paris, female labour plays a comparatively subordinate role.
Equal wages for equal work regardless of sex are, so far as I know, demanded by all socialists until such time as wages are totally abolished.
That the working woman, because of her particular phys­ iological functions, requires special protection against capitalist ex­ ploitation seems clear to me.
Those Englishwomen who championed a women's formal right to allow themselves to be as thoroughly ex­ ploited by capitalists as men are, have, for the most part, a direct or indirect interest in the capitalist exploitation of both sexes.
" As for myself, I must confess that I am more interested in the health of the coming generation than in absolute, formal equality between the sexes during the final years of the capitalist mode of production.
True equality between men and women can, or so I am convinced, become a reality only when b the exploitation of both by capital has been abolished, and private work in the home been transformed into a public industry.

]c Of course Deville is quite innocent of the trick of Hyndman and Co.
420 — for it is said that the 'John Broadhouse' who figure-heads as translator, is the immortal Hyndman himself— and I hope the thing may blow over.
Perhaps it was merely concocted between Hyndman and Kegan Paul to set us on, for Kegan Paul has not heard from me for a long time, considering that I cannot as yet fix a date when we shall be ready.
At all events we cannot have anything about this pre­ tended publication.
Of course it would be best if it turned out a mere Schreckschüsse But if not, I am bound to declare publicly that the lat­ ter half of the résumé does not render the original correctly.
I told Deville so, before it was printed, 6 and yet it was printed in the old shape, 'because the publisher would not wait'.
That could be al­ lowed to pass unnoticed in France, where the French edition is in the market.
But it will never do here, so long as there is no English translation out,56 or so long as it is brought out in competition to that.
The little squabble amongst the German deputies has on the whole had excellent effects.
The workingmen have everywhere shown such an energetic front against these ridiculous pretensions that the big men in Parliament are not likely to repeat their attempt at domineer­ ing.
374 This our men have done in the most unmistakable way and in spite of all the trammels of the Socialist Law.

— the hen that has hatched ducklings.
He has been hatching 'heducated' socialists for the last twenty years and now ob­ stinately refuses to see that the chickens are ducklings, the socialists are philanthropic Spiessburger.
* Most happy am I to see that the scrutin de liste 315 invented to per­ petuate Opportunist government, is likely to smash up Opportunism altogether.
236 If Clemenceau keeps only one half of what he prom­ ises, if he merely initiates the break-up of the vast French bureaucracy, it will be an immense progress.
On the other hand, even supposing him to really intend being sincere and a man of his word, he will find so many real obstacles, he will so soon be brought to a standstill, that to the Paris electors he will always appear as a traitor.
It is a delusion to think that in France Anglo-Saxon, especially American local self-government can be introduced without upsetting the whole bourgeois régime.
So, very soon he will have to choose: either drop his reforms and remain bourgeois avec les bourgeois^ or go on and revolutionise himself.
I think he will remain bourgeois, and then our time may come.
Schorlemmer is here, has as yet no definite projects for Continental tours, but keeps his mind's eye on Paris.
He is out at present, may re­ turn before I close this.
Here too we shall have a peaceable revolution in November.
The new electorate is sure to change the whole basis of old parties.
299 The Whigs have already declared through their great mouthpiece The Edinburgh Review that there must be now 'a parting of the waters': the Radicals are to shift for themselves and the Whigs intend joining the Tories who, they find, are not so bad after all.
424 Whether the Tories will accept them, and on what terms, remains to be seen.
The fact is that this alliance has been on the tapis for the last 10 years, but al­ ways broke down on the question of the division of the spoil.
Another progress: we shall very likely get all the rotten 'representative work­ ing men' into Parliament.
That is just the place where we want them.
Pumps wants us to go Jersey this year; if we do, and Paul is out, will you come and join us there, and then come over to London? Steamers from St Malo — or will you wait in Paris till Jollymeier comes and brings you over? You might ruminate that a bit and let me know.

& time 186 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 263 IN ZURICH London, 24 July 1885 Dear Bebel, I shall try and see whether this letter finds you in Zurich on the 26th, as you lead me to suppose.
So far as I can see from here, the row in the party is taking just the course we wanted.
Frohme has got his comrades into as nasty a fix as possible, which cannot but please us, but luckily Liebknecht is there to save their bacon; he has notified the Society over here that he will now go to Frankfurt and put everything to rights 425 but that should this fail, Frohme will have to be thrown out.
The part being played by Liebknecht in all this business is the entertaining one of the hen that has hatched out ducklings: he had thought he was rearing 'eddi-cated' socialists and lo! what emerged from the eggs but a clutch of cits and philistines! And now the worthy hen would have us believe that it's chickens after all, and not ducks, swimming about out there in bourgeois waters.
Not that there's anything we can do except take him for what he is, illusions and all, but at Offenbach, if one is to be­ lieve the newspaper account, he really has gone a bit too far.
426 Well, little will come of the whole affair save the party's awareness that it harbours two tendencies, one of which determines the course taken by the masses, the other that taken by the majority of the self-styled leaders, and that these two courses must increasingly diverge.
This will pave the way for an eventual split, and that is no bad thing.
Our friends of the Right will think twice before promulgating another ukase.
You have put your finger unerringly on Kautsky's principal weak­ ness.
His youthful tendency to make hasty pronouncements has been further reinforced by the lousy methods of teaching history at univer­ sities— particularly those in Austria.
There, students are systemati­ cally taught to produce historical papers with material which they know to be inadequate but are expected to treat as adequate, i.
e.
to write things they themselves must be aware are wrong but yet are supposed to regard as right.
Kautsky, of course, began by doing this with consid­ erable brashness.
Then came literary life — writing for money, and copiously at that.
So that he had absolutely no idea what is meant by really learned work.
He thus burnt his fingers badly on a couple of oc­ casions, first with his demographic thing and later with his articles on marriage in primitive times.
Indeed in the friendliest possible manner and without mincing my words, I told him as much, nor do I spare him in this regard, mercilessly criticising all his stuff from that point of view.
427 Luckily I am able to add by way of consolation that in my callow youth I did exactly the same thing, and that it was only from Marx that I learnt how one ought to work.
In fact, it would already seem to have helped quite a lot.
The articles in the Berlin Leitung are undoubtedly by Mehring; I, for one, don't know of anyone else in Berlin who writes so well.
428 The chap has a great deal of talent and a lucid brain, but he's a cal­ culating scoundrel and a born traitor.
I hope you will bear this in mind should he return to our midst, as he surely will the moment times have changed.
354 Walther and his wife came to see me, bringing with them papers with news of the row in the party.
They are coming again on Sunday.
" I sent off Capital II to you in Dresden as soon as it arrived.
I have finished dictating the manuscript of III in so far as this was possible, and in the autumn, as soon as I have had a bit of a holiday and attend­ ed to all manner of other urgent work, I shall embark on the final editing.
However, my mind is at rest, the ms.
is now available in a leg­ ible hand and can, if the worst comes to the worst, be printed as it stands, even if I were to kick the bucket in the meantime.
Until this 26 July 186.
Engels to Bebel.
24 July 1885 317 had been done I was constantly on tenterhooks.
Not that the editing of 3 very important parts, i.
e.
2/3 of the whole, won't involve a hell of a lot of work.
But it will all come right in the end, and I look forward to the hullaballoo it will create when it appears.
In the autumn we shall see two peaceful revolutions — the elections in France and over here.
In France, the scrutin de liste 375 invented by the out-and-out Republicans and introduced by the Gambettists so as to make sure of remaining perpetually in power by means of the enforced election of lawyers and journalists, especially Parisians, will probably lead to the wholesale ejection of the Gambettists and will almost certainly bring Clemenceau and the Radicals 429 to power, if not immediately, then in the near future.
Of the bourgeois parties that now exist, they are the only remaining possibility.
Clemenceau's panacea is departmental and communal self-government, i.
e.
decentralisation of the administra­ tion and abolition of bureaucracy.
The very fact of embarking on this would, in France, be a revolution greater than any that has happened since 1800.
But government by the Radicals in France means above all the emancipation of the proletariat from the old revolutionary tradition and a direct struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie, i.
e.

-c William I If you consider that it will be better not to refer to Rodbertus at all, then I would propose that you leave out the whole of the second part of the preface.
As an exposition of the author'sa place in the history of economical science, it is far too incomplete, unless justified by the spe­ cial circumstances under which it was written, viz.
the attacks of the Rodbertus clique.
This clique is extremely influential in Germany, makes a deal of noise, and will no doubt soon also be heard of in Rus­ sia.
It is such a very cheap and convenient way of settling the whole question, to say that our author merely copied Rodbertus,225 that it is sure to be repeated everywhere where our author is read and dis­ cussed.
But of all these matters you are the best judge, and so I leave the matter entirely in your own hands, the more so as I have not the remotest idea what your censorship would allow to pass and what not.
There are some favourable rumours spread here about our mutual friend302; can you give me any news? Yours faithfully, P.

I have at once written to Meissner for explanations and shall send you a copy as soon as received.
Marx's -b of the second volume of Capital It is quite right that you should go to see Mother Vaillant at Viller-ville but that is no reason why you should not see us.
We intend leav­ ing here on Tuesday 11th, and shall be back September 11th at lat­ est.
421 Schorlemmer will leave about same time for Germany and return via Paris about middle of September, and we cannot see any reason why you should not then come over with him.
If Paul cannot go to Bordeaux now, he may manage to go then and so everything would be for the best.
434 Your letter reminds me that indeed Deville's publisher can stop the translation for one year after publication of the original.
435 But that year has passed, as it is now two years since I had the manuscript at Eastbourne,a after which time it was brought out almost immediate­ ly.
The man who is to bring out the translation is William Reeves, 185 Fleet St.
, but we cannot either procure a copy or hear anything more about it.
Tussy and Edward were to leave yesterday for Deal, but I have not yet had a note from them with their address.
They intend staying from 10-14 days.
The Kautskys have gone to Eastbourne.
The mother Kautsky is a singularly unaffected woman for a German au­ thoress.
I have read one of her novels,b it is not at all bad.
However I advised her to study Balzac and she has taken a few volumes, but will her French be up to that sort of reading? The scrutin de liste 3 7 5 is no doubt at first against our people, but that does not matter so long as our people are not more numerous.
If they succeed in making a decent show in Paris and some great pro­ vincial centres, there will be a necessity for the Radicals next time to make a combined list with them in some places, and then some may get in; besides by that time, they will be a good deal stronger, and a good many of the outside sects, Possibilists,237 etc.
, will be broken up.
If this next electionc brings Clemenceau into office, I shall be quite satisfied.
He is the last man, as far as I can see, that the bour­ geoisie has to put forward.
After him le déluge.
436 And at the same time the elections here with an entirely new electorate 2" which must be the beginning of the end; and old Williamd on his last legs (he fell upstairs again yesterday at Gastein) —we shall see what we shall see.

It was not until Monday that Mrs Aveling ar­ rived at my house and posted me the sheets.
These went back to you corrected yesterday, Wednesday.
A lot of words had been inserted that do not appear in the original and they completely distort the sense.
And on sheet 17 in particular the pages are in a complete mud­ dle: 257, 262, 263, 258, 259, 264, etc.
, which is totally inadmissible in this, the most important chapter of the book, and that is why I have taken the precaution of writing to you.
I shall be staying here for another fortnight.
421 After Saturday, 3 September everything had best be sent to London again.
— We' are literally stifling here during the present spell of fine weather, for the lack of rain has led to a serious water shortage on this pretty little is­ land.

* The Socialists are nowhere, the Radicals are a power.
If the question can be made one for which a dozen Radicals will have themselves arrested, the government will give way — if only in view of the elections.
b If only Socialists are the victims, they will go to prison without any effect.
I like the systematic and theoretically correct way in which the French go about working the scrutin de liste.
3 7 5 Each party makes a complete list of its own.
The consequence will be that everywhere the relatively strongest party will get all their own men in, the rest none.
But at the same time each party will count itself and know its strength.
And at the next elections, the necessary result will come out: that the parties nearest to each other will combine for a joint list ac­ cording to their relative strength — unless indeed this is not already done now on the eve of the voting.
Scrutin de liste compels Radicals 429 and Socialists to have a joint list, as it will gradually compel Opportunists and Monarchists to join in a common list, at least in sundry departments.
But it is characteristic of the génie français c that this can only come out as the result of actual experience.
It is this ideological, absolute character which gives to French political history its classical form, as compared to the muddled politics of other na­ tions.
I am overwhelmed with proof-sheets, revisions, prefaces to write, etc.

Please send me if possible (along with the preface) proofs (in duplicate) of Marx vor den Geschwornen, a or at any rate clean proofs for the list of printing errors.

Immediately after that I shall put Lupus'd biography to rights for the Schlesische Milliarde as well as anything else appertaining to it.

Please send me clean proofs of everything as well as proofs of my prefaces, etc.

Now that I am back home421 the correction of proofs will be attend­ ed to speedily and punctually.
I have had a good few bones to pick with Mr Meissner about the get-up of the 2nd volume of Capital.
In the preface and text the type is all jumbled up, although I had already gone a long way towards sorting this out in the proofs, so far as it was possible to do so.

329 198 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN IN ZURICH London, 8 October 1885 Dear Ede, I enclose herewith the introductiona to the Revelations Concerning the Trial in Cologne.
b If you want to print it initially as a feuilleton in the Sozialdemokrat, I should have no objection.
Only you must come to some arrangement with Schlüter, who is probably awaiting it anx­ iously.
Tell him he will be getting the notes and the proofs of Marx's text tomorrow, as also instructions about what to print of the enclo­ sures c from Stieber.
d Karl Kautsky will be sending you a few Kölnische ^eitungs contain­ ing the first rational report on events in Bulgaria.
445 The correspon­ dent is in Belgrade and is well-informed, and since as yet Bismarck's interests have not provoked a hushing-up order, the report can, in fact, be regarded as an honest one.
So the Russians have fallen into their own trap.
They forgot that, as a lieutenant in the Prussian Guards, Alexander Battenberg is rightly relying on his 'comrade' William.
e You worry too much about someone 'succeeding' you on the Sozialdemokrat.
But the best of it is that they couldn't really put anyone in your place; any attempt on the part of those gentry to put one of their milksops would fail because 1 ) no one ofthat ilk would voluntar­ ily go into exile, 2) the party would soon put a stop to it, nor would they continue to support such a paper.
If you go, the Sozialdemokrat goes with you, and this coincidence is all to the good.
August f is likewise of the opinion that the Zurich establishments8 should in all circum­ stances remain in our hands, as indeed they probably will, since they would only be a burden to others.

But you rate these gentlemen's offensive power too high.
The acquittal in Chemnitz is splendid.
446 So it was too much of a good thing even for a Saxon judiciary.
The French elections mark a great advance.
As I had previously said," the scrutin de liste 315 has eliminated the Opportunists.
447 But that it would eliminate them so thoroughly, that the upper, middle and part of the lower middle classes would take refuge with the Mon­ archists, and do so en masse, was something that could not have been foreseen — not, at any rate, outside France.
The Opportunists played at being a 'Directory' and such was their corruption that it far out­ stripped even that of the Second Empire.
But they didn't guarantee your bourgeois the peace and quiet that would be guaranteed him by a monarchy.
The relapse into monarchism, here dubbed Orleanism, was all the more natural in that the entire Centre gaucheb (Ribot, Jour­ nal des Débats, etc.
) are simply Orleanists disguised as Republicans; so that people prefer genuine Orleanists, and are even content, if there is no other alternative, with Bonapartists and Legitimists.
The second ballots may already witness a setback, the bourgeois having taken fright at his own electoral victory, and hence a swing to radical­ ism.
If not there will soon be a set-to.
448 This much, at any rate, has been won— the ousting of the parties of the Centre, Monarchists versus Radicals, the few Centre Party depu­ ties compelled to choose between joining one or the other.
The situa­ tion is thus a revolutionary one.
No one in France seriously believes in the monarchy as such, if only because of the vast number of Pretend­ ers.
But there is some possibility of the Orleanists attempting a coup, in which case there would be a show-down.
At all events, this is how the question is presented: either la république en danger, c or the set­ ting up of a 'radical' republic.
There would seem to be every proba­ bility that the latter will prevail.
But then the Radicals429 will not only have to abide by their promisesa and replace Napoleon's central­ ised administration with the kind of self-government exercised by the departments and communes between 1792 and 1798; they will also have to rely on the support of the Socialists.
We could wish for no more favourable situation.

331 pressed for very long, but are constantly being fought out.
And we can wish for nothing better.
That the Socialists have so few votes (a source of considerable chagrin to Lafargue) is perfectly natural.
449 The French working man does not chuck away his ballot paper.
And since in France there are still living parties and not, as in Germany, only dead or dying ones, it is far from politic to vote for a Socialist who has no prospects, if by so doing one puts a Radical in the minority and an Opportunist in the majority.
The fact is that there are considerable drawbacks to the practice of nominating candidates as a measure of strength in France, as there may be in some parts of Germany as soon as life re­ turns to the political scene there.
When once the course of things in France enables the Socialists to become a political opposition, i.
e.
when Clemenceau finally comes to the helm, we shall instantly gain millions of votes.
But one shouldn't try and insist upon the French developing along German lines, although that is what many of our best men in Germany are doing.
A final verdict will not, of course, be possible until the second ballot is over.

case he would have to arrange matters with you.
a Herewith now the list of contents to show you how it has been arranged; also printing er­ rors in, and notes on, the Leipzig edition of 1875.
450 I have included only the London Central Authority's two Addresses of March and June b; the Cologne Address of December 1850c offers nothing new in the way of theory, being a detailed account of the party's break-up which today would be of importance only in a circumstantial history of the movement of those days.
The thing has got badly behindhand — through no fault of my own.
La bravoure, c'est dans le ventre, d as Marshal Davout once said to his host, Marx's father-in-law, e when the latter congratulated him on his appetite.
L'esprit, c'est dans le ventre 1 is what I say, after discover­ ing to what depths of stupidity and incapacity one can be reduced by catarrh of the stomach.
To sweat away for five hours at one page and then furiously consign what one has written to the flames — WELL, it's all over now, not to return for a very long time, or so I hope.
Tomorrow I shall tackle the introduction to the Schlesische Mil­ liarde.
'' 18 As regards the June battle, however, there's nothing doing yet.
I have become convinced that the things from the Neue Rheinische Lei­ tung can't be printed on their own without a real history of events.
4 '7 But this would call for specialised studies which can't be done until I have sorted out the piles of Marx's pamphlets, because only then shall I know what stuff I have yet to procure for the pur­ pose.
And only then could I embark on my studies.
So for the time being this will have to be shelved.

200 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 13 October 1885 My dear Laura, I return you by this post the first ten leaflets of the Manifest4*4 — I was compelled to break off, firstly because it is 5 o'clock and secondly because there is a lacune of considerable extent which I cannot fill up.
Paul I hope will send me what is wanting at once, and I will return it if possible same day.
For I see now that it will not take me long.
To tell you the truth, a translation of the Manifest always frightens me — it reminds me of weary hours spent in vain on that most untranslat­ able of documents.
But you have hit the nail on the head.
There are only two passages where you evidently were interrupted and did'not catch the exact meaning.
Otherwise the work is excellently done, and for the first time the pamphlet will appear in French in a form that we can be proud of and that will give the reader an idea of what the orig­ inal is.
As you go on towards the end, practice will make you still more perfect, and you will more and more, not translate, but repro­ duce in the other language.
You will therefore take my notes — where the meaning is not in question — as mere suggestions on the value of which you will have to decide.
I am so out of practice in speaking and writing French that positively an hour's chat with Johnny a acts upon me as a refresher upon a German Counsel, and really revives my ca­ pacity of thinking in French more than ever I should have dreamt.
I am glad indeed that you have taken this job in hand; that you would succeed if you once put your shoulder to the wheel, I never doubted, but I am glad to read the thing done.
Now we have got you in harness and will do our best to keep you in it.
It will be of infinite use to the movement in France,'for you may be sure the learning of Ger­ man will not make much progress for some time amongst them, and even those that do learn it, learn it like schoolboys and without per­ haps ever speaking to a native.
Poor Fortin's translation b do give me trouble enough — the German words are mere skeletons to him, no * Jean Longuet -b the French translation of Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte flesh and blood — how can he reproduce them in French! And Mohr's vigorous German too! Well here's to your health and success, after the Manifest anything you may tackle will appear child's play! Dinner bell — so good-bye, Yours ever, F.

452 All my papers, books, journals, etc.
, which date back to that period went astray during the upheavals of 1848-49.
The chief source, The Northern Star, is nowhere to be found, even in the north of England (Harney, its former editor-in-chief, is seeking in vain to get hold of a set).
What the bourgeois have written on the sub­ ject is for the most part false; nor have I ever concerned myself with such literature.
It's unfortunate, for if Harney doesn't write his memoirs, the history of the first great workers' party will be lost for ever.

XXVII, Moscow, 1935 Translated from the French Published in English for the first time 203 ENGELS TO SALO FAERBER IN BRESLAU London, 22 October 1885 Dear Sir, I have received your esteemed note of the 15th,454 though the seal was badly damaged; this I enclose herewith to the greater glory of Mr Stephan.
455 Since 1848 I, too, have frequently maintained that Russian tsar-dom is the last refuge and chief military reserve of European reaction.
However there have been many changes in Russia over the past 20 years.
The so-called emancipation of the peasants has created a thoroughly revolutionary situation in that it has placed the peasants in a situa­ tion in which they can neither live nor die.
The rapid development of large-scale industry and its means of communication, the banks, etc.
, have merely aggravated this situation.
Russia is faced with its own 1789.
The Nihilists,356 on the one hand, and a financial crisis on the other are symptomatic of this situation.
Prior to the last loan, things had got to such a pitch that the Russian government was unable to raise money even in Berlin unless the loan was guaranteed by a repre­ sentative assembly.
Even Mendelssohn imposed this condition.
At this point, when tsardom was in dire straits, Bismarck stepped in and authorised a loan, admittedly of a paltry 15 million pounds, a drop in the ocean, but enough to provide a few years' respite.
'82 By doing so, Bismarck subjugated Russia, which even today cannot get money without him, but by the same token he also put off the Russian revo­ lution and that certainly did not suit his book either.
It is the first time Bismarck has done something that has not indirectly and contrary to his will turned out to our advantage and if he carries on in the same way we may no longer have any use for him.
So whether the Russians are to get any more money depends pri­ marily on Bismarck and, if he consents, the financial philistines of Germany will be only too delighted to fall into the trap set for them.
The fact that they will lose their money in the process concerns me not at all; on the contrary, it will serve them right, nor will the so-called German national capital suffer much in the process, since the portion we are interested in consists of ironworks, factories and other instruments of production, which can hardly be loaned to the Rus­ sians.
The so-called money capital that is being lent is to a great ex­ tent bogus capital, lines of credit, and this is of little consequence.
What would be of far greater consequence would be to make it diffi­ cult, if not impossible, for the Russians to obtain credit, but on this score your typical German punter has more faith in Bismarck than in us.
At the moment it's quite impossible for me to spend time on an at­ tempt to reduce the question of Russian state credits to the size it de­ serves; a work ofthat kind, however timely and worthwhile, would ne­ vertheless call for a study of Russian conditions from Russian sources.
As regards the actual financial side, a table showing the Russian national debt for the past few years together with lists of stock market prices would suffice, but in the case of economic conditions within the country itself a great deal of study would be necessary if one was to form an accurate opinion.
One of the main works is a survey carried out by the Russian War Ministry under the title Boenno-cmamucmimecKiü cöopnuKb IV.

The Russian budgets aren't worth the paper they are written on.
Sheer lies and invention, more so even than those presented in Prussia prior to 1848.
As to an evaluation of the armies now reorganised along Prussian lines, this is a sheer impossibility.
We do know, however, that Austria and, to an even greater extent, Russia, lack the large educated class which alone can supply an adequate number of officers suitable for employment in armies of this size, and that, according to the account of their own General Kuropatkin,r the Russians' conduct of opera­ tions in 1878 in Turkey was inferior to that of the Prussians in 1806.

204 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 263 IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN London, 28 October 1885 Dear Bebel, Liebknecht's defeat in Saxony makes me feel sorry for him as a man, but in other respects it can do him no harm.
He sets far too much store by popularity, to which he is prepared to sacrifice more than is proper, and it will therefore do him good to see for once that no amount of concessions to the Right will be of any avail, particular­ ly when suffrage is qualified by age and property, in which case they won't even earn him the vote of the petty bourgeoisie.
458 Your news about the independent spirit of the masses gave me much pleasure.
However, the gentlemen of the right wing will refuse to credit it until some of them have been made an example of; they live within the orbit of small cliques and what they hear they assume to be the voice of the people.
The scales will soon fall from their eyes.
Chronic pressure on all the crucial branches of industry continues without remission, not only in this country, but also in France and America.
Particularly in iron and cotton.
It is an unprecedented state of affairs, for all that it is the inevitable consequence of the capitalist system: overproduction on such an enormous scale that it can't even manage to produce a crisis! The overproduction of disposable capital seeking investment is so great that the discount rate here actually fluctuates between 1 and l'/2% Per annum, while for money invested in short-term loans which can be paid off or called in any day (MONEY AT CALL) barely ll2% per annum is obtainable.
But the very fact that the financial capitalist prefers to invest his money thus rather than in new industrial enterprises amounts to an admission that the economy is, in his eyes, rotten to the core.
And this fear of new investment and any kind of speculation, already a feature of the 1867 crisis, is the main reason for the inability to bring about an acute crisis.
But sooner or later it is bound to come and then, with any luck, it will put paid to the old trades unions over here.
These cheerfully retain the same old guild character which has attached to them from the start and becomes daily more unbearable.
You might suppose that any 204.
Engels to Bebel.
28 October 1885 341 worker would be admitted without more ado by the engineers, car­ penters, masons, etc.
, if he practised the relevant trade.
Not a bit of it.
Anyone seeking admission must have been bound apprentice for a number of years (usually 7) to a workman belonging to the trades union.
This was supposed to restrict the number of workers, but served no other purpose, unless to bring in money to the master, in re­ turn for which he in fact did nothing at all.
This may have been all right up till 1848.
But since that time the tremendous growth of in­ dustry has created a class of workers as, if not more, numerous than their 'skilled' counterparts in the TRADES UNIONS, and who do as much, if not more, work than they, yet can never be admitted as members.
These people have been virtually brought into being by the guild regu­ lations of the TRADES UNIONS.
But do you suppose the UNIONS have ever thought of doing away with this antiquated rubbish? Not on your life! I cannot remember ever reading about a proposal of that kind at a TRADES UNIONS Congress.
The idiots want to reform society in accord­ ance with their own set-up, not their own set-up in accordance with society's process of development.
They cleave to their traditional superstitions, which harm only themselves, instead of getting rid of the lumber and thus doubling their numbers and strength to become in fact what they daily resemble less and less, namely anti-capitalist associations of all the workers of a particular trade.
This will, I think, help you to understand much in the behaviour of these privileged working men.
What is really essential here is for the official labour leaders to get into Parliament en masse.
That would speed things up all right; they'd quickly show themselves for what they were.
The elections in Novem­ ber should prove a great help since 10 or 12 of them are sure to get in, provided their Liberal friends don't play some trick on them at the last moment.
a The first elections under a new system 2" are always a kind of lottery and reveal only the least part of the revolution they usher in.
But universal suffrage — and its recent introduction here will, in view of Britain's industrial lead and the absence of a peasant class, lend the workers as much power as it did in Germany — is to­ day the best lever a proletarian movement can have, and so it will prove in this country also.
That's why it is so important to smash the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION300 at the earliest opportunity, for its leaders are nothing but adventurers, literati and political careerists.

342 Hyndman, their boss, is doing all he can to further this end; he can hardly wait for the little bell to strike twelve, as the folk song has it,a and makes more of an ass of himself every day, so frantically does he pursue success.
He's a wretched caricature of Lassalle.
I don't believe your opinion of the French is altogether fair.
The masses in Paris are 'socialist' in the sense of a neutral middle-of-the-road socialism distilled over the course of years from Proudhon, Louis Blanc, Pierre Leroux, etc.
The only experience they have had of com­ munism was that of Cabet's Utopia, which culminated in a model col­ ony in America, i.
e.
in flight from France and discord and semi-bankruptcy in America.
45Q Anything over and above that they de­ rive from Germany, nor is it surprising that France which, from 1789 to 1850, was in every case the first country, not only to give clear ex­ pression to political ideas, but also to put them into practice, should be somewhat reluctant to endorse her own abdication as leader in matters of revolutionary theory; particularly after the glorious Com­ mune and, what is more, vis-à-vis a Germany that was, to all intents and purposes, defeated by the Paris workers in 1870, seeing that the German army did not dare occupy Paris — a case, be it noted, unpre­ cedented in the history of warfare.
Then again, you should ask your­ self how the French workers are to increase their discernment.
Even the French edition of Capital is to them a sealed book; and not to them alone, but to a large part of the educated class as well.
The only thing they are familiar with is my Socialism: Utopian and Scientific* 60 which, in fact, has proved surprisingly influential.
None of the leaders know German, except Vaillant whom I don't count because being a Blanquist, his tactics are totally different from our own.
Mme Lafargue is now at last translating the Manifesto into good French.
* 44 Even the leaders' knowledge of theory still leaves something to be de­ sired and, if you knew Paris, you would realise how easy it is to live and agitate, as opposed to doing any serious work there.
So whence is discernment to come to the French workers? And now a further word about the elections.
In Germany it is easy to vote for a Social Democrat because we are the only real opposition party and because the Reichstag has no say in things, so that ulti­ mately it doesn't matter whether one votes at all, or for which of the 'dogs that we all are'46 ' one does vote.
The only other party to have a Engels refers to the poem Kurzweil, published in Die Volkslieder der Deutschen, Vol.

Engels to Bebel.
28 October 1885 343 a policy of its own is, perhaps, the Centre.
229 But in France, things are altogether different.
There, the Chamber is the effective power in the land and there can be no question of chucking away one's ballot paper.
Besides which it must be remembered that every time the Gambettists pit themselves against the Monarchists, and the Radi­ cals 429 against the Gambettists, a step forward is made.
And indeed practice proves this to be the case.
In Germany Junker-style reaction has flourished since 1870 and everything is retrogressing.
In France, they have the best schools in the world with compulsory education to match, and whereas Bismarck cannot get rid of the clergy,462 the French have already ousted them completely from their schools.
Our German army, apart from the growing Social Democratic element, is a more infamous tool of reaction than ever before.
In France, general conscription has brought the army infinitely closer to the people, and it is primarily the army that makes monarchy impossible (cf.
1878).
463 And if the Radicals come to the helm and are compelled to imple­ ment their programme, there will be decentralisation of the adminis­ tration, self-government for departments and communes, as in Amer­ ica and in the France of 1792-98, and separation of Church and State, every man to pay his own parson.
We are not yet in a position to direct historical developments either in Germany or in France.
This does not mean that those developments are standing still, how­ ever, but only that in the German Empire they are temporarily retro­ gressing, while in France they are for all that advancing.
But our turn will not come — such is the slow but sure course of history — until the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties, having demonstrated, pub­ licly and in practice, their inability to govern the country, find them­ selves up a gum tree.
(After a French revolution we might, somewhat anticipando,a come to power in Germany but only if carried there by a European tidal wave.
) That is why the instinct of the Paris workers in always supporting the most radical party possible is right from one point of view.
As soon as the Radicals come to the helm, the same in­ stinct will drive the workers into the arms of the Communists, for the Radicals are pledged to their old, muddled, socialist (not communist) programme and this will be their undoing.
And then instinct and rea­ son will coincide; the most radical party possible will then be the party of the proletariat as such, and things will happen fast.
But the * before our time fact is that the English and the French have long since forgotten their pre-revolutionary state of virginity, whereas we Germans, not having had a revolution of our own, are still trailing around with this some­ times very awkward encumbrance.
Both conditions have their ad­ vantages and disadvantages; but it would be most unjust to use the same one-sided standard in assessing the varying attitudes of the wor­ kers in those three countries.
Kautsky has given me Adler's very superficial booka which is largely based on Stieber.

206 ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH London, 11 November 1885 Dear Mr Schlüter, Have received clean sheets oîDùhring up to 20 inch 208; ending and prefaces are still to come.
As soon as these arrive you will be sent the list of printing errors.
The introduction to the Schlesische Milliarde 418 is in hand and would have been finished long ago but for a series of interruptions of all kinds.
It has been lying heavily on my conscience, so you may be sure that it will not be held up for a moment longer than is absolutely necessary.
You will have received the corrected proofs of the Communist League.
a You might be good enough to tell Ede that I had already received via Kautsky the book by a sparrow calling itself 'Adler', b and had de­ liberately not mentioned it because it, too, draws on Stieber 0 as the fi­ nal authority.
The passage about Buttermilch-Born was worded in that way precisely because the book left me in no doubt that Born had surreptitiously poured out some buttermilkd for Adler but had refused (see preface) to allow his name to appear.
468 Hence he had to be given a kick or two in the pants.
Dietz has written to Kautsky saying he wants to take over publica­ tion of my Origin' now and asking whether I would have any objec­ tion.
I have told him I have no objection provided he comes to an agreement with you and Schabelitz.
So you should act in whatever way you think best.
All being well, Dietz promises to place the work in the bookshops, which would of course be most acceptable to us, but then, too, Zurichf is also entitled to a say now that it has been circulating for a F.

On the other hand it was his shilly­ shallying which caused the printing to drag on for months; it's all very well for him to talk after arriving belatedly on the scene when others have already taken the risks.
Moreover I'm not acquainted with the actual details of what was discussed at the time and hence have no alternative but to refer him to you.
So please settle the affair in any way you think fit.
I have found another whole mass of printing errors in the Diihring — all of which I myself had allowed to stand.
I have become so accustomed to correcting two proofs — one for the meaning, the other for individual errors—that when there isn't an opportunity of doing so I allow utter nonsense to stand.
Hence most of them were in the first 11 sheets which were, moreover, corrected in difficult circum­ stances.
Kindest regards.

6 207 ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON IN ST PETERSBURG London, 13 November 1885 Dear Sir, I received your two letters 6/18 and 9/21 August while I was in Jer­ sey2 and immediately sent you the letter you desired for the CbeepHuü encmHUKb.
438 Since then I have been prevented by press of work from replying more fully to these letters as well as that of the 25 August/5 September.
a See this volume, p.
322.
I had no doubt that the 2nd volumea would afford you the same pleasure as it has done to me.
The developments it contains are in­ deed of such a superior order that the vulgar reader will not take the trouble to fathom them and to follow them out.
This is actually the case in Germany where all historical science, including political econ­ omy, has fallen so low that it can scarcely fall any lower.
Our Kathe­ der-Sozialisten 54 have never been much more, theoretically, than slightly philanthropic Vulgärökonomen, b and now they have sunk to the level of simple apologists of Bismarck's Staats-Sozialismus .
c To them, the 2nd volume will always remain a sealed book.
It is a fine piece of what Hegel calls die Ironie der Weltgeschichte, d 3 8 6 that Ger­ man historical science, by the fact of the elevation of Germany to the position of the first European power, should be again reduced to the same vile state to which it was reduced by the deepest political degra­ dation of Germany, after the Thirty Years' War.
469 But such is the fact.
And thus, German 'Science' stares at this new volume without being able to understand it; only, a wholesome fear of the conse­ quences prevents them from criticising it in public, and so, official economic literature observes a cautious silence with regard to it.
The 3rd volume6 will however compel them to speak out.
Of that 3rd volume, I have completed the first transcript from the original into a legible manuscript.
Three-fourths of it are almost fit for publication as they are; but the last fourth, or perhaps third, will require a great deal of work: the first section (relation of Mehrwertsrate to Profitrate 1) and then the subsequent sections on credit and partly also on Grundrente^; besides certain portions of almost all the other sec­ tions.
For the last two months I have been compelled to attend to a good deal of other work which had been neglected by my exclusive attention to the 2nd and 3rd volumes.
4 This will continue for some time yet, and then, maybe, the revision of the English translation of Volume I 56 which is nearly completed, will occupy me for a month longer, but then I shall start with the 3rd volume and carry it out to the end.
Maybe it will be published in 2 sections, as it will contain about 1,000 pages.
I thank you very much for your extracts from the author's letters from 1879 to 1881.
470 I could not read them without a sorrowful a oi Capital -b vulgar economists -c state socialism -d the irony of world history -e of Capital -' rate of surplus value to rate of profit -g ground rent (or rent of land) smile.
Alas, we are so used to these excuses for the non-completion of the work! Whenever the state of his health made it impossible for him to go on with it, this impossibility preyed heavily upon his mind, and he was only too glad if he could only find out some theoretical excuse why the work should not then be completed.
All these arguments he has at the time made use of vis-à-vis de moi"; they seemed to ease his conscience.
After completing the 3rd volume and selecting from the other ms.
the portions fit for publication, I shall very likely try to collect such of the author's correspondence as is scientifically important, and there his letters to you rank amongst the first.
When that time comes, I shall therefore avail myself of your kind offer of placing at my dis­ posal copies of these letters.
I am often in the case of forwarding to you pamphlets, etc.
— republications of the author's and my own writings, etc.
, but do not know whether it would be safe to send them direct to you.
I should be much obliged if you would tell me what to do.
I hope our mutual friend's15 health is improving, notwithstanding the bad prognosis of his doctors.
362 Any news with regard to him will always be welcome.
That crisis of which the author speaks in his letter, was indeed an exceptional one.
4 7 ' The fact is it continues still, all Europe and Amer­ ica suffer under it to this day.
The absence of the financial crash is one cause of it.
But the principal cause is undoubtedly the totally changed state of the Weltmarkt.
c Since 1870, Germany and espe­ cially America have become England's rivals in modern industry, while most other European countries have so far developed their own manufactures as to cease to be dependent on England.
The conse­ quence has been the spreading of the process of overproduction over a far larger area than when it was mainly confined to England, and has taken — up to now—a chronic instead of an acute character.
By thus delaying the thunderstorm which formerly cleared the atmos­ phere every ten years, this continued chronic depression must pre­ pare a crash of a violence and extent such as we have never known before.
And the more so as the agricultural crisis of which the author speaks, has also continued up to now, has been extended to almost all a myself -b Hermann Lopatin's -c world market European countries; and must continue while the virgin qepH03eMi»a of the Western American prairies remains unexhausted.
Very faithfully yours, P.

Perhaps they will laugh at me too.
Nim says it makes me look ten years older, out of flattery no doubt.
The insurrections of May 1849 were provoked by the refusal of most of the German governments to accept the constitution for Ger­ many as a whole approved by the National Assembly at Frank­ furt.
473 This assembly, which never had any real power and neglect­ ed any steps to acquire some, also contrived to lose the last vestige of its moral power just at the moment when it had realised on paper its somewhat romantic 'constitution'.
Nevertheless that constitution was then the sole banner under which it was still possible to try to launch a new movement — if they were not to deprive themselves of one after victory had been achieved.
In the smaller states, therefore, they sought to compel the governments to recognise it.
There followed the insurrections in Dresden (3 May) and, a few days later, in the Ba­ varian Palatinate and the Grand Duchy of Baden where the Grand Dukeb took flight, the army having declared itself for the people.
The Dresden insurrection was put down after a heroic resistance — the fighting went on for four days — with the help of Prussian troops.
a (Russ.
) black earth -b Leopold (In Prussia reaction had gained the upper hand as a result of the coup d'état of November 1848; Berlin was disarmed and placed under a state of siege.
) But to subdue the Palatinate and Baden an army was needed.
So in Prussia they made a start by calling the Landwehr 474 to arms.
At Iserlohn (Westphalia) and Elberfeld (Rhenish Prussia) men refused to march.
Troops were sent, who found the towns barricaded and were repulsed.
About a fortnight later Iserlohn was taken after two days' resistance.
Elberfeld offered relatively few opportunities for defence and so, with troops bearing down on them from every side, the defenders, about a thousand in number, resolved to fight their way through to the states that had risen in the south.
They were cut to pieces en route, but a fair number managed to get down there with the help of the population.
I was aide-de-camp to Mirbach, the com­ mandant at Elberfeld.
Before carrying out his plan he sent me on a mission to Cologne, in other words into the enemy's camp, where I hid in Daniels' house.
The truth is that he did not want to have a known communist in his corps for fear of alarming the bourgeoisie of the regions through which he was to pass.
He made a rendezvous with me in the Palatinate but failed to turn up, having been taken prisoner (acquitted by the Elberfeld jury a year later).
Mirbach had gone through the campaigns in Greece from 1825 to 1829 and Poland from 1830 to 1831; he later again returned to Greece where he died.
Meanwhile the insurrection in the south was gathering strength, but it made the fatal blunder of not attacking.
The troops of the small adjacent states were only looking for a pretext to join the insurrec­ tion, at that time they were determined not to fight against the peo­ ple.
A pretext was then provided, namely that they should advance on Frankfurt in order to protect the assembly against the Prussian and Austrian soldiers who were surrounding the place.
After the sup­ pression of the Neue Rheinische Reifung Marx and I had gone to Mann­ heim to recommend this move to the leaders.
But they produced all manner of excuses — that the army was disorganised by the flight of their former officers, that they were short of everything, etc.
, etc.
About the beginning of June the Prussians on the one hand and the Bavarians on the other, reinforced by those same troops from the smaller states whom we could have won over with greater daring, but who saw themselves drowned in an ocean of reactionary armies, ad­ vanced on the insurgent areas.
It took them no more than a week to clear the Palatinate — there were 36,000 Prussians against 8-9,000 in­ surgents, and the two fortresses of the country were in reactionary hands.
We withdrew to the troops in Baden, some 8,000 men of the line and 12,000 irregulars, themselves beset by 30,000 reactionary troops.
There were four general engagements in which numerical superiority and the violation of Württemberg territory, a move that enabled them to outflank us at the decisive moment, gave the reac­ tionaries the advantage.
After six weeks of fighting the remains of the rebel army had to cross over into Switzerland.
During this war I was aide-de-camp to Colonel Willich who com­ manded a corps of irregulars of marked proletarian character.
I took part in three minor engagements and also in the last decisive battle of the Murg.
That, I trust, will enable you to sum the whole thing up in a few lines if you absolutely insist on writing a commentary on Citizen Clarus' fine work.

475 353 In answer to Schumacher's long letter defending his attitude to the Steamship Subsidies, 476 I have written to him at equal length 39 to say that I adhere to my old standpoint, namely, that if in order to re­ spect the alleged prejudices of certain voters, you do not want to vote unconditionally against state aid paid to the bourgeoisie out of the workers' and peasants' pockets, you may, in my view, vote in favour only if a like amount of state aid is directly allocated for the benefit of the workers, both urban and rural — primarily for agricultural work­ ers' cooperatives on state-owned land.
To avoid misunderstandings I have asked him, in the event of his discussing this letter with other comrades, always to show them the whole letter.
Liebknecht has certainly come most bravely to the fore all of a sud­ den.
His 'collection' written in jail, 477 his study of the all but forgot­ ten Capital, and the prospect, suggested to him by the Right, offal-ling between two stools, seem to have proved extremely beneficial.
I shall be very happy if only it lasts.
He will certainly be in the right place when the crucial moment comes, but until then he will cause the rest of us an appalling amount of trouble with that habit he has of hushing things up, which he regards as diplomacy and at which he is, it is true, far more adept than the rest of us.
War in Europe is beginning to pose a serious threat to us.
So those miserable remnants of what once were nations, the Serbs, Bulgarians, Greeks and other rapacious riff-raff on whose behalf your liberal phil-istine enthuses in the interests of Russia, are begrudging one another the very air they breathe and must inevitably slit each other's greedy throats.
That would be marvellous and would serve the philistine na­ tionality-mongers right, were it not for the fact that each of these pigmy tribes holds the key to peace or war in Europe.
The first shot has been fired at Dragoman, 478 but when and where the last will be fired, no one can say.
Our movement is getting on so splendidly, everywhere and without exception circumstances are turning out so much in our favour and our need for another few years of undisturbed development and con­ solidation is so great, that the last thing we want is a big political row.
It would consign our movement to the background for years on end, after which we should doubtless have to start belatedly all over again, as after 1850.
On the other hand, a war might bring about a revolution in Paris which in turn would indirectly provide fuel for the movement in the rest of Europe, and in that case the French — no doubt violently chauvinist in the circumstances — would assume the leadership, a role for which their level of theoretical development qualifies them least of all.
A few peaceful years of Radical rule429 would be the very thing for the French who, since 1871, have made very good progress politically thanks to the instinctive, logical consistency that is pecu­ liar to them.
For these Radicals have adopted in its entirety the cur­ rent middle-of-the-road, jumbled-up socialism deriving from Louis Blanc, Proudhon, etc.
, and it would be of inestimable value to us were they to be given the opportunity to demolish such empty verbiage in practice.
On the other hand, should a major war break out, it will place six million men in the field and cost an unprecedented amount of money.
There will be bloodshed, devastation and, finally, a state of prostra­ tion such as has never been known before.
That's why all these gen­ tlemen are so afraid of it.
One may further predict that if this war comes, it will be the last one; it will mark the end of the class state po­ litically, militarily, economically (as also financially) and morally.
It could lead to a situation in which the war machine turns rebellious and refuses to engage in prolonged mutual slaughter for the sake of the lousy Balkan nations.
The watchword of the class state is après nous le déluge 436; but after the deluge it's we who shall come and only we.
So everything remains as it was: whatever happens, it will ulti­ mately provide a means for bringing our party to power and putting paid to all the old nonsense.
But I must say I hope it will happen without this massacre; there's no need for it.
If it's got to be, however, I only hope that when the moment arrives my old disability won't prevent me mounting a horse.

I (VI), Moscow, 1932 Printed according to the original Published in English for the first time 210 ENGELS TO MINNA KAUTSKY 479 IN VIENNA London, 26 November 1885 Dear Mrs Kautsky, (You will, I hope, permit me to use this simple form of address, for why should two people like ourselves continue to stand on ceremo­ ny?) First of all, very many thanks for your kind references to my­ self.
480 I was very sorry not to have been able to spend more time with you while you were here; it gave me infinite pleasure, I do assure you, to meet for once a German authoress who had also remained a simple woman — in this respect it has been my misfortune to meet only affected, 'eddicated'a Berlin ladies of the kind one would not urge to take up the kitchen spoon again, if only because they would eventually wreak more havoc with it than with the pen.
So I hope that it won't be too long before you cross the Narrow Seas again, when you and I shall be able to ramble gently round London and its purlieus, exchanging light-hearted banter lest our conversation should become altogether too serious.
That London didn't please you, I can readily believe.
Some years ago I used to feel much the same.
It is difficult to accustom oneself to the gloomy atmosphere and, for the most part, gloomy people, to the reserve, the class distinctions in social life, to living shut up indoors as the climate demands.
One has to temper somewhat the animal spirits imported from the Continent and let the barometer of joie de vivre fall from, say, 760 to 750 millimetres, until one finally becomes acclima­ tised.
Then one gradually reconciles oneself to the whole thing, dis­ covering that the place has its good points, that people are on the whole more straightforward and reliable than elsewhere, that no city is bet­ ter suited to the writing of learned works than London, and that the absence of harassment by the police makes up for a great deal.
I know and love Paris but, given the choice, I would rather settle perma­ nently in London than there.
Paris can only be enjoyed properly if you become a Parisian yourself, with all the prejudices of a Parisian, if a In the original 'jebildete' (Berlin dialect).
you confine your interests primarily to things Parisian and accustom yourself to believing that Paris is the centre of the world, the be-all and end-all.
London is uglier yet more grandiose than Paris, and is the true centre of world trade; it also offers a far greater variety.
But London also permits one to maintain a completely neutral attitude towards one's surroundings as a whole, as is essential to scientific and, indeed, artistic impartiality.
One adores Paris and Vienna, detests Berlin, but towards London one's feelings are those of neutral indif­ ference and objectivity.
And that also counts for something.
Apropos Berlin.
I am glad to hear that that wretched place is at last succeeding in becoming a metropolis.
But as Rahel Varnhagen said as much as 70 years ago: In Berlin everything becomes shabby, so that Berlin would seem to be trying to show the rest of the world just how shabby a metropolis can be.
Only poison all eddicated Berliners, conjure up at least tolerable surroundings there, and rebuild the whole place from the foundations up, and something decent might be made of it.
But not, I think, so long as that dialect continues to be spoken there.
I have now also read Die Alten und die Neuen* for which many thanks.
The descriptions of the life of the salt miners are as masterly as were those of the peasants in Stefan.
b Again, your descriptions of life in Viennese society are also very good on the whole.
Vienna is, after all, the only German city that has a society, whereas Berlin has only 'certain circles' and even more uncertain ones, which is why it is productive only of novels about literati, civil servants and actors.
Whether the action in this part of your book does not move rather too rapidly in places you are better able to judge than I; much that ap­ pears to do so to the likes of us, may seem perfectly natural to you in Vienna because ofthat city's peculiarly international character with its admixture of southern and east European elements.
In both spheres, too, I find your customary clear-cut individualisation; each character is a type but at the same time a definite individual, a 'This One' as old Hegel puts it, and that is how it ought to be.
But now, if only for the sake of impartiality, I really must find something to criti­ cise, and this brings me to Arnold.
The latter is indeed altogether too well-behaved and, when he is finally killed in a landslide, one can only reconcile it with poetic justice by telling oneself, for instance, that he was too good for this world.
It is always a bad thing, however, a a novel by Minna Kautsky-b M.
Kautsky, Stefan vom Grillenhof.
for an author to dote on his own hero, and you would seem to me to have erred somewhat in this direction.
With Eisa, individualisation is still in evidence, if not altogether devoid of idealisation, but with Arnold the man tends rather to be absorbed into the principle.
The source of this failing, however, may be discovered in the novel itself.
In this book you obviously felt impelled to take sides openly, to testify to your convictions before the whole world.
Now that you have done so, it is something you can put behind you and have no need to repeat again in the same form.
I am not at all opposed to tendentious poetry as such.
The father of tragedy, Aeschylus, and the father of comedy, Aristophanes, were both strongly tendentious poets, as were Dante and Cervantes, and the best thing about Schiller's Kabale und Liebe is that it was the first politically tendentious drama in Germany.
The Russians and Norwegians of today, who are producing first-rate novels, are all tendentious writers.
But I believe that the tendency should spring from the situation and action as such, without its being expressly alluded to, nor is there any need for the writer to present the reader with the future historical solution to the social conflicts he de­ scribes.
Furthermore, in present circumstances, the novel is mainly directed at readers in bourgeois — i.
e.
not our own immediate — circles and, such being the case, it is my belief that the novel of social­ ist tendency wholly fulfils its mission if, by providing a faithful ac­ count of actual conditions, it destroys the prevailing conventional il­ lusions on the subject, shakes the optimism of the bourgeois world and inexorably calls in question the permanent validity of things as they are, even though it may not proffer a solution or, indeed, in cer­ tain circumstances, appear to take sides.
Your detailed knowledge and your wonderfully true-to-life descriptions, both of the Austrian peasantry and of Viennese 'society', provide ample material for this, and you have already shown in Stefan that you are also capable of handling your protagonists with a nice irony which testifies to the command an author has over his creatures.
But now I must desist, otherwise you'll think me altogether too pro­ lix.
Over here everything goes on much as usual; Karl and his wife a are learning physiology at Aveling's evening classes and are also busily engaged in other respects; I, too, am up to my eyes in work; Lenchen, Pumps and her husbandb are going to the theatre tonight to see a melodrama and meanwhile old Europe is beginning to bestir herself a Karl and Louise Kautsky -b Percy White Rosher again, and high time too.
I only hope I shall have time to complete the third volume of Capital and then the fun can begin.
Assuring you of my cordial feelings and sincere regard, I remain, Madam, Yours, F.

42 ' Since then I have had so much urgent work to deal with that I was unable to revert to the French transla­ tion of the 18th Brumaire.
Now, having at last had time to come back to it, I find myself placed between two rival mss.
482 To begin with, it is impossible for me to set myself up as judge in a dispute when I am unable to make a careful investigation either of its causes or of its substance.
All I know is that Fortin had been in cor­ respondence with Marx for a number of years prior to the death of the latter, 483 that he asked me to revise his translation, that I prom­ ised him I would do so and that I have already attended to the revi­ sion of part of his ms.
Accordingly I feel I am committed to him.
Such being the position, I do not consider that I have the right to use your work in any way.
I shall take good care not to read a single page, for were it to prove better than Fortin's, I should be unable to prevent myself from introducing some of your turns of speech into his ms.
And that would be unfair to you and also, perhaps, to Fortin, since the two of you no longer get on with one another.
Much to my regret, the need for me to be impartial prevents my familiarising myself with your work.
I am holding the ms.
at your disposal.
The translation of the 2nd volume of Capital is an extremely diffi­ cult business.
Moreover it will be absolutely impossible for me to undertake any revision at all next year.
And then there are still many other things to consider.
At the moment I cannot commit myself to anyone; that must lie in the future.

The last loan shown therein is that of November 1873 for 15 million pounds.
After that a further loan of 15 million pounds was raised with great difficulty in 1875, but the Russians were also ad­ vised by the bankers that this would be the last time, failing a guar­ antee by a representative assembly.
For after provisional arrange­ ments had been made in 1869 in respect of the funds appropriated for railway purposes, there were further borrowings: a G.

e between 1870 and 1875, six years, 69 million pounds = 1,380 mil­ lion marks.
They now had to think up some new dodges.
Hence, 1 ) an internal loan.
Though this was in fact a forced loan, it proved an almost complete flop.
For there was little capital available in the coun­ try and the government was therefore compelled to lend its own money (paper money) to itself so as to give the impression that the loan had nevertheless been over-subscribed.
2) The Transcaucasian Railway Loan of £8,904,200.
This was raised (1880 or 1881?) abroad on the security of the Poti to Baku line, but most of it had to be expended on the construction of the line itself; hence the financial straits persisted.
Throughout this time repeated approaches were made to the bankers, all of them in vain.
Finally the Minister for Fi­ nance2 set off for the West in person — Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam; London was omitted from the itinerary as being quite hopeless.
Everywhere he met with a rebuff; even Mendelssohn, the court banker in Berlin, is said to have asked for a parliamentary guarantee point-blank; in any case he, too, turned him away.
The only remain­ ing question was whether the Russian Duma ought to be convoked a year sooner or a year later; there was no other way out.
Giers then visited Friedrichsruh and abased himself, whereupon Bismarck got hold of 15 million pounds for him in Germany, thereby postponing the evil day a little longer.
182 (One of the conclusions we may draw from the above is that Russia won't be able to start a war without Bismarck's permission, for it can only raise money under his protection and the 15 million have long since been frittered away.
So if it starts a war after all, or seriously threatens to do so, Bismarck will be directly responsible.
) I don't read The Economist, nor do I know where a run of them is to be found, for the many clubs have been the ruin of nearly all the read­ ing-rooms here.
I shall ask Kautsky to try and see if he can lay his hands on the Economist, Statist, Bullionist and Money Market Review and make extracts for you.

The seal on this letter is a count's coronet and the monogram JC intertwined.
The elections here are going very nicely.
487 For the first time the Irish in England have voted en masse for one side, to wit the Tories.
In doing so they have shown the Liberals to what extent they can tip the scales, even in England.
The 80 or 85 HOME RULERS over here — one of them has actually been elected in Liverpool! — correspond to the Centre 229 in the Reichstag and are capable of rendering any govern­ ment powerless.
Parnell must now show what he is worth.
Incidentally, the new 'Manchesterism' is also proving victorious, in other words the theory of retaliatory tariffs, which is, of course, even more senseless in this country than in Germany, but has been taken up by the new generation of manufacturers after eight years of rotten trade.
488 Next there is Gladstone's opportunist weakness and then, too, Chamberlain's inept manner, first aggressive, then ingratiating, which evoked the cry THE CHURCH IN DANGER! 4 8 9 Lastly Gladstone's de­ plorable foreign policy.
The Liberals would have us believe that the new COUNTY VOTERS will vote liberal.
These are of course an unknown quantity but, if the Liberals are to obtain an absolute majority, they will have to win more than 180 of the 300 seats still to be decided and there's no likelihood ofthat.
Parnell will almost certainly become dic­ tator of Great Britain and Ireland.

It is not of course possible to confirm — for I never saw him again after May 1848, when he disappeared for good — whether or not he spent a few days in Baden or the Palatinate.

214 ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER 484 IN GENEVA London, 5 December 1885 Dear Old Man, As it's so long since I heard from you, I am reminding you of my existence by advising you of the despatch of a £5 money order which I hope will arrive at the same time as this letter and perhaps help to lighten the transition from the old year to the new.
I trust you are still in the best of health and that you will send me a line or two before long acknowledging receipt.
I have been slogging away hard of late, as no doubt you will learn from the Zurich booksellers' publishing side, and in particular have seized the opportunity of reviving various pieces from the golden days of our youth in 1848-49.
4 9 3 This is damned important, for the younger ge­ neration, which has forgotten all about it, if indeed it ever knew, is be­ ginning to want to find out what went on at that time and, in view of the many inaccurate sources and accounts, it's important to provide them with as much accurate information as possible.
What is abso­ lutely vital is that you should finish your memoirs; years ago the Neue Welt published some really charming pieces.
a You're a wonderfully skilful narrator and on top ofthat your memory goes back at least 10 or 15 years further than mine and embraces the period 1830-40, which is also very important where later developments are con­ cerned.
Some money might also be made out of it, and that's not to be sneezed at.
I still have to revise the Peasant War2 '3 which is badly in need of it and shall then go on to Volume III of Capital, this having now been dictated in the rough from the original draft and set down in a legible hand.
It will be the devil of a task, but a splendid one.

494 Fortunately my knowledge of Russian, let alone Polish, doesn't extend to this sort of job, otherwise it would never end.
But from that you will see how extensive is the international field our communism has now conquered and it is always a pleasure when one can do one's bit towards extending that field still further.
I hope the wretched business in the Balkans445 will pass off peace­ fully.
We are making such splendid progress everywhere that a world war would be inopportune just now—too late or too early.
But ulti­ mately it would also work in our favour by putting an end to milita­ rism once and for all — at the cost of the massacre of l'/s million men and the squandering of 1,000 billion francs.
After that there could be no more war.
The elections in France have provided the Radicals with the imme­ diate prospect of coming to power and have thus been of considerable help to us, too.
447 The elections over here have temporarily made the Irish masters of England and Scotland; without them neither party can govern.
487 There are still about 100 results to come in, but they'll make little difference to the outcome.
Thus the Irish question will at last be settled — if not at once, at any rate in the immediate fu­ ture and then the decks will be cleared over here as well.
Some 8 or 10 working men have likewise been elected — some of them bought by the bourgeoisie, others trade unionists pure and simple — who will doubtless make thorough fools of themselves and be of enormous as­ sistance in the creation of an independent labour party by banishing the inherited self-deceit of the workers.
History moves slowly over here, but move it does.

Kautsky will already have written and told you something about it; 2 Echoes (Lib­ eral) enclosed herewith.
Also some other stuff, and a document (letter from Bland, based on the minutes of the Executive of the SOCIAL DEMO­ CRATIC FEDERATION, sent you by Aveling), which will give you the sub­ stance.
496 This time Hyndman has given himself the coup de grâce.
He took money from the Tories for socialist candidatures in order to filch votes from the Liberals.
He has admitted to taking £340, but since the official expenses of the 3 candidatures amounted to about £600, it must have been something in the region of £1,000, if not more.
Taking money from another party may, in certain circumstances and by way of an exception, be admissible if, 1) the money is given unconditionally and 2) the transaction does not do more harm than good.
In this instance the very opposite was the case.
1) The condi­ tion was that socialist candidates be put up in districts where they could only be made to look ridiculous — as, indeed, happened: Wil-Hams, 27 votes out of 4,722, Fielding, 32 out of 6,374; only Burns got 598 votes out of 11,055 in Nottingham.
2) Hyndman, however, knew that to take money from the Tories would spell nothing less than irrep­ arable moral ruin for the socialists in the eyes of the one and only class from which they could draw recruits, namely the great, radical working masses.
It's almost a replica of the Stoecker alliance against the Party of Progress once proposed in Berlin.
497 Well, not content with this heroic deed, Hyndman already saw himself as a second Parnell holding the scales between the two parties, though forgetting that, unlike Parnell, he does not command 80 votes in Parliament and 200,000 Irish votes in the elections in England and Scotland.
487 He got the Executive of the Federation to empower him to go to Birmingham with Champion and call on Chamberlain, the leader of the Radicals.
4 '5 With Tory money in his pocket, he offered the latter his support if he, Chamberlain, would cede him a seat in Birmingham, assure him of Liberal votes and agree to introduce an Eight Hours' Bill.
Not being such a mug as the Tories, Chamberlain showed him the door.
In the meantime the affair, arranged on the qt by the Federation's Executive, became known in the branches and caused a great furore.
Of which more in Bland's letter; it was written for publication, but you should not mention the fact that it is based on the minutes.
A gen­ eral meeting is to be called and whether the Federation will survive it seems doubtful; not, at any rate, as a viable organisation.
Herewith Hunter Watts' statement in The Pall Mall Gazette.
498 It was written with Hyndman's connivance, yet he had to let the expression 'ILL-ADVISED', used of himself, stand.
By contrast, Wil­ liams' statement in The Echo 496 is nothing less than a slap in the face, its attitude being, and not without reason, one of outright hostility to all socialist MIDDLE-CLASS MEN.
SO that's what Mr Hyndman has brought about with his pushfulness.
The man is nothing but a caricature of Lassalle, totally indifferent to the nature of the means even when not conducive to the end, provided Hyndman himself gets something out of it; add to that his perpetual craving for instantaneous success, so that he kills the goose that lays the golden egg; and finally, the way he considers himself the centre of the universe, being utterly incapable of seeing the facts in any light other than that which is gratifying to him.
And, for good measure, a political adventurer comme il faut.
a All Lassalle's bad points magnified, and not a single one of his good ones.

She may be able to get you what you want.
In opposition to your Social Studies Group 179 the good Malon and the no less celebrated Elie May have just set up a Republican Social Economy Society with ready-made rules.
500 Let's hope this 'research group' will be confined to Malon who will do his research in May's bosom, and to May who will do his research in Malon's heart.
They are petty panjandrums whom you_ would be well ad­ vised to ignore completely; that would infuriate them most of all.
It's Karl Blind to the life.
Why are you making such a splash in the Socialiste with Williams and the Social Democratic Federation? 501 You ought to know what attitude to take with respect to Hyndman, and this time you have fallen into a fine old trap.
In the first place, Hyndman has contrived to make his party a laughing-stock second to none.
Williams collected 27 votes out of 10,000, Fielding in North Kensington 32 out of 10,000, proper Burns in Nottingham 598 out of 11,000.
a Whereupon the liberal press kicked up an almighty fuss, alleging that the money needed for these foolish candidatures had been provided by the TORIES, and that the socialists had so lowered themselves as to do that party's dirty work for it.
Williams then wrote to The Echo on 5 December496 saying that all this had been arranged while he was in Liverpool, that they had recalled him by telegram without giving details, that he had been treated by the leaders as a mere tool and that he now saw * 'that we cannot trust the middle class men of our movement any longer.
I am not prepared to be made the tool of middle class men.
I call upon my fellow wage-slaves to meet me as soon as possible and to say good-bye to the middle class men and to shut them out from what must be a real working men's organisation', * etc.
— in short he has now adopted a stance directly opposed to Hyndman, Champion, etc.
Now for what has been happening in the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERA­ TION (by the same post you will be getting a lettter via Aveling from Bland, one of its members).
Hyndman was given money by the TORIES to put up candidates against the Liberals — £340 has been admitted.
But it must have been in the region of £1,000, since the official ex­ penses of the 3 candidates amounted to more than £600.
— With the exception of Burrows, the Executive Committee sanctioned Hynd-man's action.
However opposition arose within the main body of the federation.
But before this could make itself felt, Hyndman, already seeing himself in the role of political arbitrator à la Parnell, left with Champion for Liverpool to offer his services to — Chamberlain, the Radical leader 415! The proposal they made the latter was that they would support the Liberals if Chamberlain was prepared to with­ draw a Liberal candidate in Birmingham in favour of Hyndman and thus secure him the Liberal vote.
Chamberlain showed them the door.
Opposition within the federation is increasing.
At the last Com­ mittee meeting, at which many other members of the federation were present, the correspondence relating to the Tory money was read out, despite opposition from Hyndman who wished to suppress it.
Great rumpus.
Why had the sections not been consulted on so vital a mat-a Cf.
the relevant figures in the previous letter.
ter? In short there is to be a general meeting and we shall have to see whether the federation survives it.
Obviously one may accept money from another party if that money is given unconditionally and if it does not do more harm than good.
But Hyndman has acted like an idiot.
In the first place he ought to have known that his candidatures couldn't help but manifest the ridiculous weakness of socialism in England.
Again, he ought to have known that, by accepting money from the TORIES, he has damned himself once and for all in the eyes of the radical working men who form the vast majority and to whom alone socialism can look for support.
In short, if one does such things, one advertises them, one boasts about them, but one doesn't make a secret of them.
Hyndman, however, is a caricature of Lassalle; to him all means are good, even if not conducive to an end.
He is in such a hurry to play the political panjandrum that he has no time to consider his real position.
He combines all the bad qualities of your English PROFESSIONAL POLITI­ CIAN— your ADVENTURER — with a quality common enough in France but rare over here, of seeing facts not as they are but as he would like them to be.
All this has come so soon after his infamous behaviour towards Aveling502 that he has not yet been forgiven — even within his own party — and he is bound to have a pretty hard time of it if he is to survive the affair.
In any case, if the Social Democratic Federation continues, it will no longer have any substance.
A kiss for Laura.

22 December 1885 375 222 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 22 December 1885 My dear Laura, Herewith I hand you the cheque Paul wrote about507 to which I have added a trifling étrenne* for yourself.
The box with the plum-pudding and cake was forwarded last Saturday b but would not leave here before Monday so that you will at best have received it today.
When Jollymeier came from Paris he told me you were sorely in want of dictionaries for your translating work.
Among Mohr's books the only one that could have suited you was Mozin's French and Ger­ man, but it was so dilapidated that it will be no use to any one for reg­ ular work; Tussy took it at the time.
English and German there were none.
So I tried to find out what were the best and ordered Williams and Norgate to have them delivered to you, bound.
They are Flügel's English-German and German-English Mozin-Peschier French-German and German-French.
They will be delivered I expect before Christmas.
Now as I had no opportunity to look at them, I want you to examine and report upon them.
Flügel is the best to be had, though it might be better; so if it is both English-German and German-English, it will be all right.
But about the Mozin-Peschier I am not so sure that it is not an abbrevia­ tion of what I intended to send you, namely: Dictionnaire complet des langues française et allemande, 2 volumes French-German and 2 volumes German-French.
If it should not be the latter work, please let me know and I will have it exchanged, as not being sent to order.
On Saturday night Jollymeier arrived here, his holidays last till 12th January; and this morning who should jump in but the inevi­ table Meyer, fresh from Winnipeg where his first crop of wheat was frozen to death last August.
He left again and will be in Paris to­ morrow morning — but, he says, ich sehe die Lafargue' s nicht—warum nicht? —Weil Lafargue einen nie besucht" — which he seems to have a Christmas gift -b 19 December -c I don't see the Lafargues.
— Why not? — Because Lafargue never comes to see anyone.
taken very much to heart, and which I told him was rather foolish for him to do.
I merely state this to you as it was said, so that you may console you in case the illustrious stranger does not call upon you.
I will try and get a copy of Justice for Paul,508 it is not so easy just now, as Tussy and Edward are at Kingston on Thames for a few days and will not be back before Friday.
Johnnya is with us in the mean­ time, he has picked up his English again rather quickly, especially since he goes to school.
He is a very good boy and reads an awful deal of, to him, unintelligible books.
I hope Paul is all right again, sound at the core and solid at the base, plus solide que le Pont JVeuf h which seems also subject to pim­ ples and boils.
509 By the bye, his last letter does not say a word about the final solution of the Labruyère-Séverine-Lissagaray affair, the last was the assertion of Labruyère that Lissagaray a mentis Has it all ended in smoke, as most scandals are apt to do now-a-days? There is no doubt Hyndman has done for himself this time.
If he manages to keep together a show of the Social Democratic Federa­ tion, 300 it will be only a shadow.
The provincial branches are sure to fall off and here in London his own people have remembered how at the time of the Morris-Aveling separation,d he packed the general meeting by showing in a lot of new members, created for the occasion.
They have therefore resolved that only those are to vote who were members at the time of the general election and of his exploits.
496 Nim, Pumps and Jollymeier are gone to the West End, Christmas shopping as they pretend, but in reality for a dinner at the Vienna Beer Hall.
As I am still a little under restraint, I have stopped at home and use the time to write to you.
But now the dinner bell rings — for me and Johnny — and so good-bye.
Health and spirits and a sound foundation for Paul! Yours affectionately, F.

223 ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT [IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 34] London, 28 December 1885 Dear Liebknecht, Borkheim died in Hastings on Wednesday, 16 December, and was buried on the following Monday.
An attack of pneumonia on the pre­ vious Sunday swiftly brought about his end.
He had had tuberculosis for 12 years and during the final ten years, after the whole of his left side had become paralysed, he never left his bed save for a few brief intervals each day.
He bore his sufferings with exceptional resilience and indomitable cheerfulness, always kept up with the political and social movement, and was a subscriber to the Sozialdemokrat until the very end.
Up till a year ago he received a pension, first from two, then from one, of the houses for whom he had previously worked as sales­ man and/or buyer.
Last year we collected amongst his friends here a subscription big enough to ensure that he had what he needed.
You might perhaps put a short obituary in the Sozialdemokrat 5 ' ° ; I prefer not to thrust myself to the fore on an occasion like this.
There is no objection to your doing it and, besides, you are better acquainted with his activities in Baden.
As regards Russia's finances,485 herewith a further word on the latest critical turn the affair has taken: A fortnight ago the Russian government obtained through Bleich-röder and the Russian Bank a further loan, but only of 20 million roubles, which was, according to reports, heavily over-subscribed in Berlin.
Depending on whether this is taken to mean roubles in specie or in paper, and that's something you can ascertain over there, it rep­ resents roughly either 60 million marks or else a mere 40 million.
The loan was intended to secure the advances made by the Russian Bank to the government.
As usual, the same old hollow excuse.
How hollow became evident a few days later! About a week ago it was reported in the English papers that the Russian government had ordered the Russian Bank to sell the Russian aristocracy's (doubtless the Credit Bank's) mortgage bonds for 100 million roubles.
The German press, enlarging on this, stated that in return the Bank was to advance the government 75 million of the proceeds.
Thus the government is pay­ ing the Bank at best 20 million roubles in gold and is borrowing in re­ turn 75 million roubles extra.
But since the realisation of 100 million mortgage notes is a highly tedious operation, especially in Russia, this means, in other words, that 75 millions in new paper money are to be created and loaned to the government.
Before the holidays the rouble was standing at 23'jgd.
(instead of 39d.
) over here and is bound to go even lower — as it will also do internally; in their present financial predicament the device they have to use to give some support to their ruined currency (the 20 millions in gold, when the Bank gets it) serves only to bedevil their paper currency even further.
1789 is on its way — even without the Nihilists356 — expedited by the government itself.
One may further conclude from the above that Bismarck is hold­ ing his Russians on a short rein and will not authorise the release of German funds other than on a hand-to-mouth basis lest the Russians should get too uppish and do the dirty on him in the Balkans.
445 I can only suggest the main points for you to work on, but you will have little difficulty in finding out further details in Berlin.
This Christmas we — the Avelings, the Kautskys, Pumps and her husband,3 Schorlemmer, Lenchen and I — sat up drinking to our hearts' content and making merry until four in the morn­ ing.
A Happy New Year to you.

He had had tuberculosis for twelve years and for the last ten years the whole of his left side had been paralysed.
According to the doctor he had enough ailments to kill three other men.
All this he bore with indomitable cheerfulness and, so far as he was able, kept up with the movement to the end.

No great loss to him — she drank.
His son,a aged 19, is a clerk in Dunkirk.
To begin with he him­ self was in business in Liverpool; during the Crimean War a specula­ tive trip to Balaklava with a load of bits and pieces earned him .
£15,000 all at one go, which, however, he lost because he did the same thing again and peace supervened 5 '2 ; became a wine merchant and discovered that his palate for Bordeaux was probably the finest in London; became the agent of a Bordeaux house, built up a clientèle for them, but was insufficiently circumspect and, when he sought a partnership, was given the push — they no longer needed him.
No wiser for the experience, he tried to repeat this brilliant performance with another house, the result being the same, hence had to start from the beginning once more.
Again promptly discovered two good con­ nexions, lived like a lord as always, while at Badenweiler had an apoplectic fit (about 10 years ago), which completely paralysed his left side, whereupon it transpired that, rather than possessing money, he had been borrowing from his friends in order to support his madly extravagant mode of life.
But in spite of it all he was so much liked that people calmly put up with their losses, while the two houses for which he had worked paid him a pension to live on.
His housemaid, with whom there had undoubtedly been some highly intimate goings-on, looked after him up till his death — she was able to furnish a F.
Borkheim 381 a boarding-house in Hastings239 and still do pretty well out of it dur­ ing the season.
A year ago, when the last of his pensions was stopped, we succeeded in persuading his CITY friends, all of whom were owed money by him, to provide a new and adequate pension.
Absurdly os­ tentatious in his conduct while his luck was in, he behaved like a hero when suddenly assailed by the most atrocious ill-fortune.
Never a word of complaint, unfailingly cheerful, no sign of his having been affected by this sudden downfall.
Rarely have I met such resilience.
He spent his time writing his autobiography, first in English, then in German; the latter is probably not quite finished.
248 If you could find a publisher for it as well as some money for the boy, who earns a wage of £70 after an upbringing that might almost suggest his having been born in the purple, you would be doing a good turn.

Borkheim, aux soins de* Messieurs Bourdon & Cie, Dunkerque, France.
You are on the wrong track with your suppositions about the secret insinuations concerning you that have come to my ears.
The only good friend who might possibly have managed to find some fault with you, the one 'who told you' this, 'who told you' that? — is called Wil­ helm Liebknecht 15 and his insinuations have appeared in writing in his letters and in print in the Sozialdemokrat and any number of Ger­ man newspapers.
Thanks to this source I have known for years that you have a pleasing and insuperable weakness for all the 'eddicated' elements that hover round the fringes of the party and that you wish to win them over, even though 95 per cent of them can only do us harm.
I further understand from this source that last year you only noticed personal differences within the parliamentary group 49 where­ as now you are already discovering 'backsliders'.
I am also indebted to the above source for the knowledge that this same Wilhelm Lieb­ knecht is on occasion inclined to forget what has been written if, at that moment, it doesn't suit his book and that he hopes others will be good-natured enough to do him a similar favour.
Which is not, unfor­ tunately, always possible.
But as to your passion for picking up 'eddi­ cated' elements and glossing over all differences, one must put up with such things and does so fairly readily for their being unavoid­ able.
But don't ask that they be overlooked.

Still, as you say, NEVER MIND.
Borkheim was born in Glogau in 1825, studied at Greifswald and Berlin, was a three-year artillery volunteer in Glogau in 1848, came under investigation as a result of democratic meetings and bolt­ ed; subsequently spent some time in Berlin, fled, I believe, after the storming of the arsenal 516 and went, if I'm not mistaken, to Swit­ zerland, whence he returned with Struve.
I don't remember thf exact details.
I shall be writing about the biographical note.
5 '7 Tussy will be given your message on Sunday.
b If you and Bebel, both of you, go to America together, you will cer­ tainly be able to raise money; should either of you not go or be re­ placed by someone else, that would make a difference of 25%-30% in the money you would receive.
518 Besides, you yourself will be par­ ticularly needed, since at least one of you will, from time to time, have to make a speech in English.
As regards the Baltic Canal I'm all for its being at least 8 metres deep.
5 '9 The size and draught of merchant STEAMERS are constantly increasing (5,500 tons is already quite usual), and new docks are be­ ing increasingly taken to a depth of 9 or 10 metres, so that a shall­ ower canal would become obsolete within a few years, just like the Eider Canal now, which became completely so 30 years ago (as to some extent it always had been).

b They were promised to be sent from here more than a week before Christmas.
Yesterday I received a post-card from Dr Max Quarck informing me that as a good extract from the Capital is wanted, he intends to translate DevilleV: 'Herr Deville hat mir nun eben auf mein Nachsuchen die alleinige Autorisation zur Übersetzung seines Auszuges ins Deutsche gegeberi A\ the great Quarck has offered it to Meissner and desires me to favour him with a preface.

-d '/« reply to my request Mr Deville has just granted me the unreserved right to translate his brief exposition into German.
' Now if Deville has really done so, I cannot but consider that he has acted very unwisely and moreover contrary to all the international obligations practically existing amongst the lot of us.
How in the world could he commit himself with a man of whom he knew noth­ ing? This Quarck is one of half a dozen young literati who hover about the boundary land between our party and the Katheder-Sozialismus, 54 take jolly good care to keep clear of all the risks in­ volved by being connected with our party, and yet expect to reap all the benefits that may accrue from such connection.
They make a live­ ly propaganda for das soziale Kaisertum der Hohenzol-lern* (which Quarck has dithyrambically celebrated), for Rod-bertus against Marx (Quarck had the cheek to write to me that he honoured the Capital by placing it in his library neben die Werke des grossen Rodbertus h) and especially for each other.
The fellow is so utterly impotent that even Liebknecht who has a certain tender­ ness for these fellows, has agreed with Kautsky that he is not fit to write in the Neue £eü.
52° This moment Kautsky enters with Paul's letter,c according to that Deville has not replied and Quarck lies.
I should be very glad if this was so, because then I should have that little scamp completely on the hip.
But now as to the translation itself.
First of all, an extract from the Capital for our German workmen must be done from the German original, not from the French edition.
59 Secondly Deville' s book is too big for the working men, and would in the translation, especially of the second half, be as difficult as the original, as it is composed as much as possible of literal extracts.
81 It does well enough for France where most of the terms are not Fremdwörter, d and where there is a large public, not exactly working men, who all the same wish to have some knowledge — of easy access — of the subject, without reading the big book.
That public, in Germany, ought to read the original book.
— Thirdly, and chiefly, if Deville's book appears in German, I do not see how I can consistently with, my duty towards Mohr let it pass un­ challenged as a faithful résumé.
I have held my tongue while it was published only in French, although I had distinctly protested against the whole second half of it, before publication.
e But if it comes to be put before the German public that is quite a different thing.
I cannot allow, in Germany, Mohr to be perverted — in his very words.
If there a the social empire of the Hohenzollerns -b beside the works of great Rodbertus-c Lafargue's letter to Engels of 10 January 1886-d foreign words-' See this volume, pp.

had not been that absurd hurry at the time, if it had been revised as I suggested, there would not be that objection now.
All I can say, I reserve my full liberty of action in case the book is published in Ger­ many; and I am the more bound to do so as it has got abroad that I looked it over in the ms.
I cannot this moment ask Kautsky about his intentions as to Deville's book, because all the people for Sunday's dinner have come in, and I must conclude.
Kautsky must write himself.
As far as I know Kautsky and Bernstein intend making a fresh extract themselves which would be decidedly the best thing to do, and where they may make use of Deville's work and acknowledge it with thanks.
137 Tussy, Edward, the Pumps' and Kautskys, all send their loves, kind regards and kisses and I don't know what more, ditto Johnny3 and the other little ones.

dressing-down; I have, through Kautsky, drawn his attention to a number of points — the essentials can safely be left to him.
522 For Kautsky this controversy with Schramm has been salutory in every way.
523 Schramm, being unable to say anything about the ac­ tual matter in hand, is skilful enough to pick on all the errors of form perpetrated by Kautsky, partly out of youthful impetuosity, partly out of the habits acquired at university and in literary practice, and this has been a very salutory lesson to him.
In this respect Ede already has a considerable advantage over Kautsky because, though neither a university man nor a professional littérateur, he is, through being on the Sozialdemokrat, always in the thick of the fray, besides which he's a business man and, last but not least, a Jew.
For after all it's only in war that you learn the art of war.
What you tell me about the parliamentary group's frame of mind is most encouraging.
Provided the party remains sound — and here the petty bourgeoisie will surely not gain the upper hand — the blunders of the deputy gentlemen can only serve to give these last a rude les­ son.
As you yourself say — and this is also my opinion — we shall never get the right kind of people into the Reichstag in time of peace and here the help afforded us by the party through bringing pressure to bear on the deputy gentlemen is absolutely invaluable; it shows that they must avoid any serious conflict, and the knowledge that this is so might, at a crucial moment, be of the utmost importance, since it would enable us to make a resolute stand in the certainty that we should emerge unscathed.
Of late Liebknecht has been positively bombarding me with letters asking for information about this and that.
I took the opportunity of telling him, briefly and unequivocally, if in an altogether friendly way, just what I thought of his inconsistent conduct; and when, as usual, he tried to attribute this to some piece of gossip I must have heard, I told him that there was only one person who could harm him in my eyes, and that was Wilhelm Liebknecht who was for ever for­ getting what he had said in his letters and published in the press.
However that might be, I went on, we should simply have to put up with his foibles, and would do so all the more readily for the knowl­ edge that, when things really came to a head, he would be found in the right place.
a Whereupon, contrary to his usual customary insis­ tence upon having the last word, he calmed down again.
a See this volume, pp.
381-82.
As he mentioned the matter of the Schleswig-Holstein Canal, I took the opportunity of telling him that it would be stupid to vote for a shallow canal less than 8 or 9 metres deep, a allegedly out of op­ position to its use by the Fleet.
The tonnage of large merchant ships is steadily on the increase, 5,000 or 6,000 tons being already the norm, and ever more ports are being adapted to accommodate vessels of cor­ responding draught.
Those that cannot do so become obsolete and fall into decay, as will also happen in the Baltic.
If the Baltic is to have its share of overseas trade, deep water harbours will accordingly have to be built there, and this will happen as surely as it has happened elsewhere.
But to build the canal in such a way that, within the next 10 or 20 years, it will become as useless and obsolete as the old Eider Canal is now, would be throwing money down the drain.
As regards my proposal for productive cooperatives on state-owned land, b its sole purpose was to show the majority — which was, after all, then in favour of the Steamship Subsidies342 — how they could de­ cently vote against it and thus emerge from the impasse in which they found themselves.
But in my view, the principle of the thing was alto­ gether correct.
It is perfectly true that, when we propose something positive, our proposals should always be practicable.
But practicable as such, regardless of whether the present government can implement them.
I would go even further and say that, if we propose socialist measures conducive to the downfall of capitalist production (as these are), we should restrict them to such as are essentially feasible, but could not be implemented by this government.
For this government would tamper with and ruin any such measure, and put it through merely with a view to sabotaging it.
This particular proposal, how­ ever, would not be implemented by any Junker or bourgeois govern­ ment.
To point the way for the rural proletariat in the Baltic prov­ inces, if not set it upon the path that would enable it to put an end to exploitation by the Junkers and big farmers — to attract into the move­ ment the very people whose servitude and stultification supplies the regiments upon which Prussia entirely depends, in short, to destroy Prussia from within, from the root up, is something that would never occur to them.
The measure for which we must press, come what may, so long as big estates continue to exist there, and which we must ourselves put into practice the moment we come to the helm, is as fol-a See this volume, p.

389 lows: the transfer — initially on lease — of large estates to auton­ omous cooperatives under state management and effected in such a way that the State retains ownership of the land.
But the great ad­ vantage of this measure is that it is perfectly feasible as such, although no party except ours would embark upon it, and thus no party can bedevil it.
And it alone would suffice to put paid to Prussia, so that the sooner we popularise it the better for us.
The matter has nothing whatever to do either with Schulze-Delitzsch or with Lassalle.
Both supported small cooperatives, in one case with, in the other without, state aid; but in neither were the co­ operatives to take possession of the already extant means of production; rather they were to introduce new cooperative production alongside already extant capitalist production.
My proposal envisages the in­ troduction of cooperatives into existing production.
They are to be given land which would otherwise be exploited along capitalist lines; just as the Paris Commune demanded that the workers should manage coop­ eratively the factories closed down by the manufacturers.
a Therein lies the great distinction.
Nor have Marx and I ever doubted that, in the course of transition to a wholly communist economy, widespread use would have to be made of cooperative management as an in­ termediate stage.
b Only it will mean so organising things that so­ ciety, i.
e.
initially the State, retains ownership of the means of pro­ duction and thus prevents the particular interests of the coopera­ tives from taking precedence over those of society as a whole.
The fact that the Empire is not a land-owner is neither here nor there; you will find some formula, just as you did in the Polish debate, for here again the expulsions were no immediate concern of the Empire's.
524 Precisely because the government cannot envisage anything of the sort, there would be no harm in demanding the grant I propose as a counterpart to the steamship grant.
Had there been any possibility of the government's assenting to it, you would, of course, have been right.
The disintegration of the German Free Thinkers 231 in the sphere of economics tallies exactly with what is happening among the Eng­ lish Radicals.

dabbling in piecemeal social reform.
Save that here the bourgeois wish to help not so much the industrial worker as the agricultural la­ bourer who rendered them such signal service during the late elec­ tions487 and, in true English fashion, are demanding intervention not so much by the State as by the local authorities.
For rural work­ ers, allotments and potato patches, for those in the towns, sanitary improvements and the like, such is their programme.
It is an excellent sign that the bourgeois should already be having to sacrifice their pet classical economic theory, partly on political grounds and partly be­ cause they themselves have lost faith in it as a result of its practical consequences.
The same thing is evident in the growth of armchair socialism 54 which, in one form or another, is increasingly supplant­ ing classical economics in academic faculties on both sides of the Channel.
The real contradictions engendered by the mode of produc­ tion have in fact become so glaring that no theory will now serve to conceal them save the hotch-potch of armchair socialism which, how­ ever, is not a theory but sheer drivel.
Six weeks ago there were said to be indications that business was looking up here.
Now all that is over and done with; poverty is worse than ever before, as is the mood of hopelessness and, on top of that, the winter is an exceptionally severe one.
This is already the eighth year in which overproduction has exerted pressure on the markets and, instead of improving, the situation is getting steadily worse, nor can there be any doubt that it is essentially different from what it used to be.
Since the appearance of serious rivals to Britain on the world market, the era of crises, in the old sense of the term, has come to an end.
If, from being acute, the crises become chronic yet lose nothing of their intensity, what is likely to happen? There is bound to be another, if brief, period of prosperity after the vast stocks of goods have been run down, but I am curious to see what will come of it all.
Of two things, however, we may be sure: We have entered a period which poses a far greater threat to the existence of the old state of so­ ciety than did the period of ten-year crises; and, secondly, prosperity, if it comes, will affect Britain to a much lesser extent than before, when it alone used to skim the cream off the world market.
The day when this is clearly realised in this country will be the day when the socialist movement will begin here in real earnest — and not before.
I shall have to leave the composition of the English Liberals to 391 another time.
It is a complex subject because it involves depicting a state of transition.
430 This morning I received from Dresden the debate on the Polish mo­ tion (1st day).
No doubt the 2nd day will follow shortly.
a It is all the more essential for me to be sent these things now that I see only the weekly edition of the Kölnische Leitung which contains only brief ex­ cerpts from the debates.
How are the short-hand reports sold? I will gladly pay for those of all debates in which our people take a serious part.
Whatever happens, it's essential that you should also go on the American tour.
5 '8 On the one hand, its success greatly depends on your presence.
On the other, the party will not be properly represent­ ed unless you are there.
If you don't go, the first-comer will be sent along with Liebknecht, and who knows what might not happen then.
Thirdly, you should not miss the opportunity of seeing with your own eyes the most progressive country in the world.
Life in Germany exerts an oppressive and constricting influence on anyone, even the best, as I know from my own experience, and one ought to get out of the place — from time to time at any rate.
And in that case we might also see you over here again.
Had I been able to get away from my work, I should long since have slipped across to America, as I was al­ ways hoping to do with Marx.
Anyway, to people abroad, you and Liebknecht represent the party and there is no substitute for either of you.
Should you not go, it will mean a loss of anything between 5,000 and 10,000 marks, if not more.
It might, in fact, be a very pleasant experience.
For Tussy and Aveling have been corresponding with American free-thinkers about the possibility of a trip to that country, and would like to combine it with yours.
They expect to hear within the next 3 or 4 weeks.
If it comes off, the four of you would make agreeable travelling compan­ ions.
But now, good-bye for the present.

Having said this much, I need not enter upon other considerations which might stand in the way of my writing the article you desire.
But I may state at all events that the party to which I belong, has no fixed ready-made proposals to submit.
Our views as to the points of difference between a future, non-capitalistic society and that of to­ day, are strict conclusions from existing historical facts and develop­ ments, and of no value—theoretical or practical — unless presented in connection with these facts and developments.

I hope your Adolf has made a success of his new business.
For he understands it and is a hard worker; besides, it's not a particularly speculative business — a great danger, in America as here — so I don't see why all should not be well.
I therefore wish him every suc­ cess.
I should greatly like to have Marx's comments re an English trans­ lation.
526 At last I have with me, here under my roof, the complete ms.
of the English translation upon which I shall set to work next week.
As soon as I know approximately how long the revision is going to take, and can thus determine the date when printing may begin, I shall make definite arrangements with the publisher.
You will have seen (in To-Day) how Mr Hyndman, alias Broadhouse, endeavoured to put a spoke in my wheel.
527 This has forced me to get a move-on so as not further to impair my position vis-à-vis the publisher, but otherwise no harm has been done.
An American womanb has translated my book on the working Adolf Sorge jun.

for revision — parts of which will be very time-consuming.
Its publication in America is assured, but what this lady sees in the old thing I cannot imagine.
I further have in hand — to mention only revisions: 1) The Eight­ eenth Brumaire, b French — about lj3 already done.
2) Wage Labour and Capital by Marx — Italian.
3) The Origin of the Family — Danish.
4) Manifesto'1 and Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, etc.

528 PLENTY MORE LOOMING IN THE DISTANCE.
As you can see, I'm turning into a mere schoolmaster correcting exercise-books.
It's lucky that my knowledge of languages is not more extensive, for if it were, they'd be piling Rus­ sian, Polish, Swedish, etc.
, stuff on to me as well.
But it is work of which one easily tires — in any case all these nice little bits and pieces (at any rate Nos.
2 to 5) will have to give way before Volume III of Capital which I have finished dictating from the ms.
, though the editing of some of the most important chapters will involve a great deal of work, these consisting in little more than an assemblage of building blocks.
That is the only task to which I look forward.
I have not yet had the New Torker Volkszeitung.
I shall, if possible, send off To-Day, September, by the same post as this.
You've no idea how difficult these things are to get hold of here — the slovenliness of the publishers is quite disgraceful.
If you haven't yet seen it, get Dietzgen to give you Hubert Bland's piece on Hyndman's simultaneous machinations with the Tories and Liberals over the elections.
496 It is absolutely true.
After this, and provided it doesn't disintegrate, the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION300 will be morally defunct.
Hyndman must be mad to act as he does.
You will have read all about his insane attack on Aveling, and will also have seen the relevant documents in Justice and Commonweal.
502 Unfortunately, none of the other leaders of the FEDERATION are worth much more than he, being literati and political speculators.
Indeed, the movement in this country has hitherto been quite bogus, but should it prove possible to educate within the SOCIALIST LEAGUE 346 a nucleus with an understanding of theoretical matters, considerable progress will have been made towards the eruption, which cannot be long in coming, of a genuine mass movement.

True, the Anglo-Americans want to do things their own way with a total disregard for reason and science, nor could one expect anything else, yet they are drawing closer and will end up by coming all the way.
Over there capitalist centralisation is going ahead like a house on fire — unlike here.
I trust your health is completely restored.
I'm pretty well on the whole, otherwise I should never get through my work.
I've been working on Bebel with a view to his visiting the States with Liebknecht.

Of course if American workingmen will not read their own States' La­ bour Reports,514 but trust to politicians' extracts, nobody can help them.
But it strikes me that the present chronic depression which seems endless so far, will tell its tale in America as well as in England.
America will smash up England's industrial monopoly — whatever there is left of it — but America cannot herself succeed to mat monop­ oly.
And unless one country has the monopoly of the markets of the world, at least in the decisive branches of trade, the conditions — relatively favourable — which existed here in England from 1848 to 1870, cannot anywhere be reproduced, and even in America the con­ dition of the working class must gradually sink lower and lower.
For if there are three countries (say England, America and Germany) com­ peting on comparatively equal terms for the possession of the Welt-a experiment upon one's own worthless body -b F.

That is the reason why I am watching the development of the present crisis with greater interest than ever and why I believe it will mark an epoch in the mental and political history of the American and English working classes — the very two whose assistance is as absolutely necessary as it is desirable.

Along with England and Switzerland, Holland is the only West European country not to have had absolute monarchy in the period between the 16th and 18th centuries, and in consequence enjoys a number of advantages, nota­ bly a residue of local and provincial self-government and an absence of any real bureaucracy in the French or Prussian sense.
This is a great advantage both as regards the development of a national char­ acter and as regards the future; for only a few changes will have to be a world market made to establish here that free self-government by the working [people] a which will necessarily be our best tool in the reorganisation of the mode of production.
All this is lacking in Germany and France and will have to be built up from scratch.
May I congratulate you on your success in producing a popular exposition.
Your translation of my pamphletb places me most deeply in your debt.
In this instance it will not be so easy to employ popular lan­ guage throughout, as in your little opus, but this should present no problem to someone with so good a command of both languages as yourself.
'Gewanne'' are the strips of land of roughly the same quality into which common agricultural and pasture land is first divided; maybe ten or twenty in all.
Then each commoner with full rights is given an equal share of each strip.
Thus, if there are ten strips and a hundred commoners, there will be 1,000 parcels of land all told, each com­ moner getting 10 parcels, one in each strip.
Subsequently commoners may often swap parcels so that though they may have fewer indivi­ dual plots, their holdings are more compact.
The same thing was still happening until quite lately in Ireland in the 'RUNDALE' 532 villages, and in the Highlands of Scotland (cf.

If you would be good enough to send another copy to Mr Otto Meissner, Hamburg, our German publisher, you would very much oblige me.
I have read your excellent preface53* with much pleasure, and a of Capital-h (Russ.
, gen.
case) Engels-0 into Russian of the second volume of Capital -d Pyotr Lavrov -e Vera Zasulich -f Karl Marx that I have done so attentively, I should like to prove to you by stat­ ing that on page X, line 17, the printer seems to have left out a word; should it not read as follows: ITO H nepeMtHHaa nacrb nanumaMHOu CTOHMOCTH, a etc.
? The omission is not of much consequence for any one who is used to the author's terminology, but would perhaps be puzzling to one who is not.
I thank you very much for your observations on the economical condition of your country.
5 3 5 Anything of this class is always of the highest interest to me.
The last 30 years have shown, all over the world, in how little time the immense productive powers of modern industry can be implanted and take a firm root even in countries hitherto purely agricultural.
And the phenomena accompanying this process repeat themselves everywhere.
What you tell me about pay­ ments in coupons not yet due occurred all over Germany ten or fif­ teen years ago and may occasionally occur still; but especially before the introduction of the new coinage the complaints about the circula­ tion of such coupons, not yet due, and originally given in payment of wages were universal.
The rapid development of German manufactu­ res has now passed beyond that stage, and if it still occurs it will be an exception; but fifteen years ago it was the rule, especially in Saxony and Thuringia.
But that your economists should consider this as a proof of a deficiency of circulating medium, and that in the face of a paper currency depreciated by over-issue at least 36%, that is on a level with the views of the American greenbackers 536 who demanded, too, an increased issue of paper money because that paper money was no longer depreciated and therefore evidently under-issued! I am glad to learn that our friend b is recommended a change of cli­ mate— I suppose it will be about the same where the doctors sent him to before and which seemed to agree well enough with his state of health.
At all events this is proof to me that all danger of a sudden crisis in his malady is now over.
362 I have now at last the whole manuscript of the English translation of Volume Ic in my hands and shall go into the revision of it next week, and when I may have an idea how soon I can finish, conclude at once with a publisher.
56 There are two translators, the one a bar­ rister and old friend of ours d (you and he are the two men living who know the book most thoroughly) but his professional occupations do s that the variable part of capital value, too -b Hermann Lopatin -c of Cap­ ital -d Samuel Moore not allow him to do it all in time, so Dr Aveling, the husband of the author's youngest daughter/ offered his services; but both the econo­ mic theories and the language of the author are rather new to him and I know the portion done by him will give me more work.
As soon as that is in a fair way of getting ready for the press, I shall start again with Volume III b and do it to the end, not allowing any other work to interrupt it.
Here the industrial crisis gets worse instead of better, and people begin to find out more and more that England's industrial monopoly is at an end.
And with America, France, Germany for competitors in the world's market, and high duties excluding foreign goods from the markets of other rising industrial countries, it becomes a simple mat­ ter of calculation.
If one great monopolist industrial country pro­ duced a crisis every ten years, what will four such countries produce? Approximatively a crisis in 10/4 years, that is to say practically a crisis without end.

Yesterday they must needs interfere in a meeting of the unemployed — who count now by hundreds of thousands — in order to preach La Révolution — revolution in general, and ask the mass to hold up their hands, those who were ready to follow Mr Champion to—well to what he does not know himself.
Hyndman who can only overcome his personal cowardice by deafening himself by his own shouts, went on in the same strain.

ture of roughs and 'Arrys to leaven the whole into a mass ready for any 'lark' up to a wild riot à propos de rien.
3 Well just at the time when this element was getting the upper hand (Kautsky who was there 539 says das eigentliche Meeting war vorbei; die Keilerei ging los und so ging ich weg h) the wiseacres above-named took these roughs in procession through Pall Mall and Piccadilly to Hyde Park for another and a truly revolutionary meeting.
But on the road the roughs took mat­ ters into their own hands, smashed club windows and shop fronts, plundered first wine-stores and baker's shops, and then some jewel­ lers' shops also, so that in Hyde Park our revolutionary swells had to preach 'le calme et la modération"! While they were soft-sawdering, the wrecking and plundering went on outside in Audley St.
and even as far as Oxford Street where at last the police interfered.
The absence of the police shows that the row was wanted, but that Hyndman and Co.
donnaient dans le piège d is impardonable and brands them finally as not only helpless fools but also as scamps.
They wanted to wash off the disgrace of their electoral manoeuvres 496 and now they have done an irreparable damage to the movement here.
To make a revolution — and that à propos de rien, e when and where they liked — they thought nothing else was required but the paltry tricks sufficient to 'boss' an agitation for any vile fad, packing meet­ ings, lying in the press, and then, with five and twenty men seemed to back them up, appealing to the masses to 'rise' somehow, as best they might, against nobody in particular and everything in general, and trust to luck for the result.
Well I don't know whether they will get over it so easily this time.
I should not wonder if they were arres­ ted before the week is out.
English law is very definite in this respect: you may spout as long as you like, so long as nothing follows; but as soon as any 'overt acts' of rioting ensue, you are held responsible for them, and many a poor devil of a Chartist, Harney and Jones and others, got two years for less.

We thought it very strange that Bernstein should have recommend­ ed a fellow like Quarck d and asked him.
Here is his reply which I give you literally so that there can be no mistake: 'Von einer Quarck-Empfehlung bin ich mir gar nichts bewusst, wie sollte ich einen Mann empfehlen den ich gar nicht kenne? Es ist möglich dass ich auf eine Anfrage einmal geantwortet, der Mann sei kein Parteigenosse, aber es liege nichts gegen ihn vor, aber auch nur möglich.
.
.
Sollte da nicht eine Verwechslung vorliegen? Ich selbst kenne Quarck gar nicht, habe auch noch nie mit ihm korrespondiert.
Also wie gesagt, ich bestreite nicht absolut, über Quarck einmal Auskunft erteilt zu haben, aber empfohlen habe ich ihn nicht.
c Pardon me that I bother you again with this affair, but I wish to have this extract forwarded to Paris in the original German.
As to the rest I write to Paul about it.
Otherwise I wish Deville every happiness in his new ménage 1 and hope it will not interfere too much with his regularity of habits.
If once settled down in a new routine, he prom­ ises to be the best and happiest of husbands.
The people here go on much as usual.
Edward has taken a hall in Tottenham Court Road where he preaches twice every Sunday to an attentive and on the whole reasonably well paying audience — it interferes rather with his after-dinner port, but it's a good thing for him as it defeats Bradlaugh's plan to ruin him as a public lecturer, he also goes now and then to provincial towns for 3 lectures on a Sun­ day! and one the Saturday evening.
Bax is something like Paul, writes a The Condition of the Working-Class in England -h Florence Kelley-Wisch-newetzky -c of Capital-6 See this volume, pp.

-c 'I am totally in the dark about Quarck's recommendation.
How could I give a recommendation to a person of whom I know nothing at alt? It is possible that I could have answered a query to the effect that the man is not a party member, but nothing can be held against him, but this is only a possibility.
.
.
Hasn't there been a mix-up? I myself do not know Quarck at all and have never corresponded with him.
So, as I've already said, I can­ not say for certain that I haven't given some information about Quarck, but I have ne­ ver recommended him.

Now as to the rumpus on the 8th inst.
a Despite publicity to the contrary, the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION is an exceedingly weak organisation which comprises some good ele­ ments but is led by literary and political adventurers who, by a stroke of genius, had brought it to the very verge of dissolution on the occa­ sion of the November elections.
496 At the time, Hyndman (pronounc­ ed Heindman), head of the society, had accepted money from the Tories (Conservatives) and used it to put up Social Democratic can­ didates in two London boroughs.
Since they had not a single adher­ ent in either constituency, the consequent debacle might have been foreseen (one of them got 27 and the other 32 votes, each out of See this volume, pp.

Engels to Bebel.
15 February 1886 407 a possible 4-5,000!).
But hardly had Hyndman touched the Tories' money than his head began to swell inordinately, and he departed forthwith for Birmingham where he called on Chamberlain, now a Minister, and offered him his 'support' (amounting, for the whole of England, to barely 1,000 votes) if he, Chamberlain, would secure him, Hyndman, a constituency in Birmingham with the help of the Liberals, and also introduce an Eight Hours' Bill.
Chamberlain, be­ ing no fool, showed him the door.
Despite all attempts to hush up the matter, there was a great rumpus about it in the Federation, and dissolution was imminent.
So something had to be done to get things going again.
In the meantime unemployment was steadily rising.
As a result of the collapse of Britain's monopoly of the world market, a state of crisis has persisted uninterruptedly since 1878 and is growing worse rather than better.
Poverty, particularly in London's East End, is appalling.
The winter which, since January, has been exceptionally severe, com­ bined with the abysmal indifference of the propertied classes, has giv­ en rise to great unrest among the mass of the unemployed.
As al­ ways, political wire-pullers have sought to exploit that unrest for their own ends.
The Conservatives, recently deprived of office,542 blamed unemployment on foreign competition (rightly) and foreign protec­ tive tariffs (for the most part wrongly), and advocated 'FAIRTRADE', i.
e.
retaliatory tariffs.
There is also a labour organisation which is predom­ inantly in favour of such tariffs.
543 This last called the meeting of the 8th inst.
in Trafalgar Square.
538 Meanwhile the SOCIAL DEMOCRAT­ IC FEDERATION had not been idle; having already demonstrated in a minor way, they now sought to take advantage of the afore­ mentioned meeting.
Thus two meetings took place, that of the reta­ liatory tariffs men, round Nelson's Column, the other addressed by the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION men from a street next to the NA­ TIONAL GALLERY, some 25 feet above the north side of the square.
Kautsky was present539; he left before the rumpus began and told me that practically all the genuine working men attended the other meeting, while Hyndman & Co.
had a mixed audience who were out for a lark, and in some cases were already half seas over.
If this was evi­ dent to Kautsky who has been here barely a year, it must have been even more so to the gentlemen of the Federation.
Nevertheless, when things seemed to be already subsiding, they put into practice an idea long cherished by Hyndman, namely a procession of 'unemployed' along Pall Mall, the street of the great political, aristocratic and 408 ultra-capitalist clubs which are the hubs of political intrigue in Brit­ ain.
The unemployed who followed them to another meeting in Hyde Park were mostly of the kind who do not wish to work — barrow-boys, idlers, police spies and rogues.
Jeered at by the aristo­ crats from the club windows, they smashed the latter, likewise shop windows, and looted wineshops, the better to set up an impromptu consumers' club in the street so that, once in Hyde Park, Hyndman and Co.
had hastily to swallow their bloodthirsty slogans and preach moderation.
But by now the thing had gathered momentum.
During the procession and this further little meeting as well as after it, most of the lumpen proletariat Hyndman had taken for unemployed poured along several of the grander streets nearby, looting jewellers' and other shops, and using the loaves of bread and legs of mutton thus looted solely for the purpose of smashing windows until eventually they scattered without encountering any resistance.
Only a few stragglers were dispersed in Oxford Street by four (sic!) policemen.
Otherwise the police were nowhere to be seen, and so conspicuous were they by their absence that it was not only we who believed it to have been intentional.
Evidently the chiefs of police are Conserva­ tives and not averse to seeing a bit of a rumpus in these days of Liberal rule.
However, the government immediately set up a Committee of Inquiry and this may cost more than one of these gentry his position.
In addition, very half-hearted proceedings have been instituted against Hyndman & Co.
which, to all appearances, will be allowed to peter out, although English law provides for very stiff sentences the moment inflammatory speeches give way to overt acts.
True, the gen­ tlemen talked a lot of bunkum about social revolution which, having regard to their audience and in the absence of any organised support amongst the masses, was sheer lunacy, but I can hardly believe that the government would be so stupid as to make martyrs of them.
These socialist gents are determined to conjure up overnight a move­ ment which, here as elsewhere, necessarily calls for years of work,— though, once it has got going and has been imposed on the masses by historical events, it will admittedly advance far more rapidly here than on the Continent.
But men of this type cannot wait — hence these childish pranks such as we are otherwise wont to see only among the anarchists.
The alarm of the philistines lasted four days and has now finally abated.
One good thing about it is that the existence of poverty, which the Liberals simply denied and the Conservatives tried to ex-ploit solely for their own ends, has now come to be recognised, and people see that something has got to be done, if only for appearances' sake.
But the subscription fund started by the LORD MAYOR amounted, by Saturday, 11 to barely £ 20,000 544 and, given the number of un­ employed, would barely last out 2 days! But of one thing at least we have again received proof: Until something happens to frighten them, the propertied classes are totally indifferent to the destitution of the masses and I'm not at all sure they don't need rather more of a -fright.
Now for France.
Last week saw an event of an epoch-making kind, namely the constitution of a workers' party in the Chamber.
It has only three members, and two Radicals besides,429 but a start has been made and the split is definitive.
Basly (pronounced Bali), a miner and then a landlord (because dis­ ciplined) from Anzin, carried out an investigation on the spot of the killing of the infamous pit manager Watrin in Decazeville.
545 On his return, he first communicated his findings to a big meeting held on the 7 th in Paris, in the course of which the Radicals from the Cham­ ber came off very badly.
b On Thursday in the Chamber he made a really splendid speech when he questioned the Ministry.
c He was left in the lurch by the whole of the extreme Left.
The only ones to speak in support of him were the two other working men, Boyer (of Mar­ seilles, ex-anarchist) and Camélinat (ex-Proudhonist, Communard refugee), besides which he was applauded by Clovis Hugues and Planteau, while the other extreme Radicals were as if thunderstruck by this first bold, independent move on the part of the French prole­ tariat in the Chamber.
(Between ourselves, Basly is completely under the influence of our men, Lafargue, Guesde, etc.
, of whose theoretical advice he is greatly in need and which he gladly accepts.
) I am sending you the Cri du Peuple with a full account of this histor­ ic sitting which I suggest you study.
It's well worth the trouble.
The importance of the rupture has been confirmed by Longuet who has just been over here and who, as Clemenceau's friend and fellow-editor, spoke with some disapproval of this unparliamentary behav­ iour on the part of the workers.

-c See Basly's speech in the Chamber of Deputies on 11 February 1886 (Le Cri du Peuple, No.

So in Paris, too, we now have our people in parliament, and of this I am glad, not only for the sake of the French to whose progress it will give a tremendous impetus, but also for the sake of our parliamentary group, some of whose members might yet learn much about boldness of approach from the above; for now we also have foreigners whom we can hold up as an example to the faint-hearts and weaklings.
The best part of it is that the Radicals proposed these chaps in the hope of being able to manipulate them, and now their trouble has been for nothing.
I, too, felt very doubtful about Camélinat as a former Proudhonist, but a point in his favour was that, when he came here as a refugee, he immediately sought work in Birmingham (he is one of the best engravers) and had nothing to do with refugee politics.

The sitting of the French Chamber on the 11 th was an historical event.
a The ice — the parliamentary omnipotence of the Radicals429—has been broken and it matters little whether those who dared to break it numbered three or thirty.
And it was this superstition amongst the Parisian working men — this belief that by going further than the Radicals they would endanger the Republic or See previous letter.

foi TïjOUrrujf Miners on strike in Decazeville, January 1£ at least play the Opportunists' game 236 by dividing the 'revolution­ ary party'—which lent strength to the Radicals.
This is the definitive defeat of Utopian socialism in France.
For the Radicals were all 'socialists' in the old sense of the term.
What sur­ vived of Louis Blanc's and Proudhon's dieses served them as socialist trappings; they represent French Utopian socialism stripped of the Utopias and hence reduced to a phrase pure and simple.
On 11 Feb­ ruary this antiquated French socialism was crushed by the interna­ tional socialism of today.
The Poverty of Philosophy! So far as your propaganda in Paris and in France generally is con­ cerned, this is an event of prime importance.
The effect will be felt very quickly.
The Radicals — whether they make a clean break with the workers or whether they temporise by granting them more or less sterile concessions — will lose their influence over the masses and, along with that influence, such little potency as is left in traditional socialism will be lost, and people's minds will become more receptive to a new order of ideas.

a has left me in no doubt that Clemenceau and the rest of his gang, embroiled as they are in ministerial intrigues, have caught the parliamentary disease, that they no longer see clearly what is going on outside the Palais Bourbon and the Luxembourg, that it is here that, for them, the pivot of the movement lies and that, in their eyes, extra-parliamentary France is of no more than secondary impor­ tance.
All this has given me the measure of these gentlemen.

with my — introduction or postscript3 6 ° — according to where it may suit you to place it.
I believe the title had better be a simple translation: The ' Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, etc.
I am glad that all obstacles to publication have been successfully overcome.
Only I am sorry that Miss Foster has applied to the Execu­ tive of the Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei in New York, 549 as appears from their report of meeting in Der Sozialist, New York, 13th Febru­ ary.
Neither Marx nor myself have ever committed the least act which might be interpreted into asking any Working Organisation to do us any personal favour—and this was necessary not only for the sake of our own independence but also on account of the constant bourgeois denunciations of 'demagogues who coax the workmen out of their hard-earned pennies in order to spend them for their own purposes'.
I shall therefore be compelled to inform that Executive that this application was made entirely without my knowledge or au­ thority.
Miss Foster no doubt acted in what she thought the best way, and this step of hers is in itself no doubt perfectly admissible; still, if I could have foreseen it, I should have been compelled to do every­ thing in my power to prevent it.
550 The revision of your translation has delayed that of the English translation of Das Kapital 5 6 by three weeks — and at a most critical period of the year too.
I shall set about it to-night and it may take me several months.
After that, the German 3rd volume must be taken in hand; you see, therefore, that for some time it will be impossible for me to undertake the revision of other translations, unless few and far between and of small volume.
I have at this moment waiting here an Italian translation of Marx's Lohnarbeit und Kapital* which must wait some weeks at least.
But if you will translate that into English (it was recently republished at Zurich) and will not be too pressing for time, I shall be glad to revise it, and you cannot have a better popular pamphlet than that.
My Entwicklung 0 Aveling intends to translate, and as the subject is iri part rather difficult, I could not well give it to anyone except he be here on the spot, accessible to verbal explana­ tion.
528 As to my Anti-Diihring I hardly think the English speaking public would swallow that controversy and the hostility to religion which pervades the book.
However we may discuss that later on, if you are of a different opinion.
At present Marx's posthumous manuscripts must be dealt with before anything else.
The semi-Hegelian language of a good many passages of my old book is not only untranslatable but has lost the greater part of its meaning even in German.
I have therefore modernised it as much as possible.

You will have to see to the matter yourselves, e.
g.
by getting in touch with the Standard correspondent as Longuet, for instance, did in Paris with Mother Crawford, the Daily News correspondent.
Knowing that the Reichstag has no real sa^y in anything, the British press very rarely mentions it, save for quite short telegrams.
If you had not virtually confined yourself to Faerber's view of the harm suffered by German capitalists, 15 but had introduced the present eastern imbroglio445 and blamed it on Bis­ marck as the man who, because of the loan, has the Russians eating out of his hand, your speech could not have been passed over in complete silence.
But what you say about the worthlessness of Russian paper is common knowledge even in this country.
Now as regards those charming German literati who infest the neutral border zone between ourselves and the armchair54 and state socialists, and want to pocket all the advantages to be derived from our party while carefully shielding themselves against any disadvan­ tage arising out of intercourse with us— I've just had another demon­ stration of what shits the said literati are.
An importunate fellow by the name of Max Quarck — nomen est omenc —wrote to me saying that Deville in Paris had given him exclusive rights to translate his abridg­ ment of Capital, and asking me to recommend him to Meissner and write a.
preface for him.
d It was all a lie, a fact of which I have received confirmation from Paris and as he himself informed Kautsky in a let­ ter the selfsame day.
And now the wretch has the effrontery to suggest * Liebknecht's speech in the Reichstag on 8 February 1886 (Stenographische Berichte über die Verhandlungen des Reichstags.

that /should beg his pardon for his having lied to me! Just let him try that again, the scoundrel.
520 You people will find you have competitors in France.
The three working men, Basly, Boyer and Camélinat, since joined by Clovis Hugues, have set themselves up in the Chamber as a socialist labour group a in opposition to the Radicals,429 and when, at a meeting last Sunday, the Radicals tried to inveigle the constituents into passing a vote of no confidence, they met with a resounding defeat — so much so that at the meeting they themselves had convened, the Radicals did not dare to open their mouths.
b These three French working men will make more of an impact in Europe than your 25 because they sit in a Chamber which, unlike the Reichstag, is not a debating society, and because they have shaken themselves free of the milk-and-water petty-bourgeois following which hangs like a millstone round your necks.
Clemenceau is now faced with a last crucial decision, but we can be almost sure that he will not hesitate to join the bourgeois camp, in which case, though he will indeed become a minister, he will be done for.

I have received your kind letter of 8 February and the manuscript,a which I shall deal with as soon as possible.
But at the moment I am of the Italian translation of Marx's Wage Labour and Capital obliged before anything else to check through the English translation of Capital, Volume I, which is most pressing and must be printed without delay56; it is no easy task.
When I have a free moment I shall devote it to your work.
I have also received, and I thank you for them, the 6 copies of the Origin etc.

553 I shall not repeat it.
I must get hold of the calendar in order to restore the passage that was stuck and illegible554; I hope to find it here in London at a friend's house; this is another cause of delay.
I am sorry I cannot do better and more quickly than this, but the English Capital must take precedence; in any case I am committed by a deadline to the publisher.

a This business of the '2nd edition' has its dubious aspects, but when I consider that the two markets are completely different and that the '1st edition' is therefore unlikely to get in the way of the '2nd', it's unlikely to do much harm.
555 Admittedly I should have been happier had Dietz consulted us first.
He has behaved very arbit­ rarily in the past over other matters.
This time it was quite unneces­ sary; he could, e.
g.
, easily have informed me about the matter through Kautsky.
But he likes faits accomplis and I shall get someone to tell him as much.
4) Reports of the International.
556 I was in Manchester at the time and can't really remember the details.
The General Council did, at any rate, send a MESSAGE to all the congresses, but Marx's papers and pamphlets are all of them still in the unsorted state they were in when I lugged them over here and it will take about 6 weeks to put them in order.
However I've asked Kautsky to make in­ quiries from Lessner; I should be very surprised if he hasn't collected everything.

As to the introduction, I shall be glad to go through your ms.
But here too there are few sources and the bourgeois have been responsi­ ble for some serious falsification.
Last year Harney scoured the whole of Yorkshire, Lancashire and London for one copy of The Northern Star, the paper which he had edited and which had had a circulation of 100,000 copies.
In vain.
Evanescence — such is the curse that af­ flicts all proletarian literature not included in official literature.
Thus Owen's works are nowhere to be had and the BRITISH MUSEUM would pay a great deal of money for a complete collection.
A genuine ac­ count will therefore be difficult.
The Brentanos and Co.
know nothing.
The Charter ' ° ' was drawn up in 1835, not 1838, and O'Connel b was also involved if I'm not mistaken.
What Brentano says about the peti­ tion is utter nonsense c; after 10 April the bourgeois of both parties stuck together and in such a case lies are always disseminated, it being impossible to refute them either in Parliament or in the press.
Even if a House of Commons Committee did scrutinise the petition (which I very much doubt), it would have been quite in­ capable of distinguishing the genuine from the bogus.

Moscow, 1935 Published in English for the first time 247 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 15-16 March 1886 My dear Laura, You complain of the weather, and you are in Paris! Look at us here — nothing above freezing-point for the last ten days, a cutting east wind, of which you don't know which is the worst, the north-east or the south-east,— and to-night a fresh couche de neige 3' on streets and roofs.
Nim is at her second cold, but it's getting better, I had one too, Pumps and Percy are in the same boat too, fortunately the children are well.
However there must be an end to this some time, only I wish it would come.
The English Capital is at last getting into shape and form.
56 T have the whole ms.
here and begun revising.
Saving the 1st chapter which will require a severe overhauling, the first 200 pages of the orig­ inal German are ready to go to press.
I saw Kegan Paul last week, declined his proposals of two years ago and submitted mine.
They were accepted in principle.
This, with a man like Kegan Paul who is on all hands described as extremely slipping, means very little, and I expect there will be a tussle with him yet.
But that matters nothing at all, because our position in the market has improved wonderfully and we have at least one other good firm who will be glad to take it on " cover of snow very favourable terms.
As soon as the thing is concluded I will let you know.
The book will be published end of September so as not to come out in the dead season, and this gives me time to do the revising work thor­ oughly.
Practically 300 pages of the original are revised, but the last 500 I have not as yet looked at, and there are some very difficult chapters there.
And it would never do to hurry over them.
Broadhouse-Hyndman goes on translating 'from the original Ger­ man' in To-Day.
527 He has in the sixth monthly number just finished Chapter I.
But his 'original German' is the French translation now, and he insists on proving that with French he can play ducks and drakes quite as much as with German.
The thing does so little harm, so far, that Kegan Paul never even mentioned it.
But it "has done this good that I have got Moore and Edward to finish their work.
You have no idea how difficult it is to get hold of this To-Day.
I have paid in advance but have to dun them almost every month for my copy, moreover it comes out at all times of the next month.
Tussy last year went and paid for a copy to be sent to you but as far as I have heard it was never sent! However there is nothing whatever in it except — Christian Socialism! You will have seen from Justice— that at least you do receive in ex­ change for the Socialiste — how Hyndman keeps up his alliance with Brousse and even ignores the new proletarian party in the Cham­ ber.
559 To me, this appearance of a.
parti ouvrier a in the Palais Bourbon, is the great event of the year.
The ice is now broken with which the Radi­ cals 429 had so far succeeded to cover the working masses of France.
These Radicals are now forced to come out in their true colours, or else follow the lead of Basly.
The latter they will not do for long, nor willingly.
Whatever they do, they must alienate the masses and drive them to us, and that quick.
Events move rapidly, the Decazeville af­ fair could not come more opportunely than it has done.
545 C'est coup sur coup! 0 And a very good thing it is that this takes place not in Paris but in one of the darkest and most reactionary and clerical corners of la province.
I am exceedingly curious to learn how the affair has ter­ minated to-day in the Chamber.
" But whatever is done, must turn out to our benefit.
a workers' party-b One follows upon another.
-c See this volume, p.
428.
The reappearance of France on the scene of the proletarian move­ ment 'comme grande puissance' a will have a tremendous effect every­ where, especially in Germany and America; in Germany I have done my best to let them know the full importance of the event, and sent Basly's speechb to Bebel; Camélinat c will follow as soon as I get it back from Kautsky.
How furious Longuet must be that his old friend and as he believed protege Camélinat has turned his back upon him! At the same time, our Paris friends have done whatever they could to pave the way so that the event, when it came, found a terrain préparé? Their action since the elections has been perfectly correct — their attempt to rally all revolutionary proletarian elements, their forbearance towards the Possibilists, 237 their limiting their attacks to those points and facts which showed Brousse and Co.
as simple ob­ stacles to union — all this was just what it should have been.
And they are now reaping the fruits: Brousse has been driven into a position where he must find fault with Basly and Co.
and thereby sever the last bond which still united him to the movement of the masses.
Savoir attendre" —that is what our friends have learnt at last, and that will carry them through.
Paul will be, if he likes, in the Palais Bourbon be­ fore Longuet.
A citoyen Hermann has applied to me for an addressed adhesion to what I suppose is your meeting on the 18th.
560 I send itr to you here­ with 1 ) to be sure that it falls into the proper hands and 2) that you and Paul may look over and mend my rickety French.
Now good night, it's one o'clock and I must look over some papers yet to get them out of the way of to-morrow.
Kind regards to Paul.

I, Paris, 1956 248 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 521 IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN London, 18 March 1886 Dear Bebel, I am up to my eyes in the revision of the English translation of Cap­ ital, Volume I, which is at last on the point of coming out,56 but since the business of Liebknecht's fund is urgent, I shall have to take a moment or two so as to be able to answer your letter quickly.
Here­ with, then my contribution,— a cheque for £10 on the UNION BANK OF London.
561 Many thanks for the Anti-Socialist Law and spirits monopoly de­ bates c and the Bürger-Leitung.
It is indeed striking how faithfully the Anti-Socialist Law debate reflects the mood of the majority in the parliamentary group.
Unable, presumably, to do as they wished they had, willy-nilly, to voice rela­ tively correct opinions, and the impression made by the debate is, on the whole, very good, particularly since Singer was compelled by the Ihring case562 to speak pretty sharply.
In general these people, not excepting even Frohme, are not too bad when they have to come out against the police, either in their own interests or in those of their con­ stituents and hence keep the worthy citizen well out of sight, for one of their besetting sins is this very worthiness which seeks to convince an opponent rather than fight him because 'our cause is, after all, so noble and so just' that any other worthy citizen is bound to come over " sings another tune than before-1' The situation is getting grave for Messrs the Radicals.

to us if only he can be made to understand it aright.
This appeal to worthy sentiments, which neither recognises nor wishes to recognise the interests by which those sentiments are unconsciously motivated, is one of the chief characteristics of the philistinism which is peculiar to Germany and would be impossible over here or in France, either in parliament or in literature.
Never have I come across anything so tedious as the spirits debate; even Bamberger's jokes were as bad as ever, if not worse.
So what matter if, after that, Schumacher also spoke tediously, proceeding to make what amounted to a naked appeal for 'étatisation" [Verstaat-lichungs].
Richter's speech, based on statistics, was quite the best.
I would not venture to pass judgment on Liebknecht's speech as re­ ported in the Bürger-Leitung.
So much depends on nuances and the manner in which something is said and, in a summarised report, all that gets lost.
563 I have not seen the account by Kautsky of which you speak.
But as regards Hyndman, his behaviour in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park on 8 February did far more harm than good.
538 Revolutionary rant­ ing, which in France would be seen as the outmoded rubbish it is and do no harm, is sheer folly over here, where the masses are totally un­ prepared; it puts off the proletariat, encouraging only the worthless elements and, in this country, lends itself to but one interpretation, namely incitement to looting which in fact ensued, so that we shall be lastingly discredited over here, even in the eyes of the working class.
As for its having drawn attention to socialism, you over there cannot know the extent to which, after centuries of freedom of the press and of assembly and its accompanying publicity, the public has become completely impervious to such methods.
True, the initial alarm of the middle classes was quite funny, and brought in a subscription of some £40,000 for the unemployed — in all about £70,000 — but that has already been spent, nothing else is forthcoming and poverty is as be­ fore.
What has been achieved is to equate socialism with looting in the minds of the bourgeois public and, while this may not have made matters much worse, it has certainly got us no further.
You might think that Hyndman showed great courage and so it might seem.
But Hyndman, as I have learnt from Morris and others, is a coward and has behaved as such on crucial occasions.
This doesn't prevent him, having once got himself into a dangerous fix, from drowning his cowardice in his own clamour and giving vent to the most bloodthirsty utterances.
But this only makes him all the more of a menace to his colleagues — for no one, neither he nor they, can tell beforehand what he is going to do.
Fortunately the whole business has been pretty well forgotten over here.
I wholly agree with your view that periods of prosperity of over 6 months will cease to recur.
The only prospect of a reactivation of trade — directly where iron, at any rate, is concerned and otherwise indirectly — lies in the possible opening up of China to railway con­ struction and hence the destruction of the only remaining closed and self-sufficient civilisation based on a combination of agriculture and handicrafts.
But 6 months will be enough to discount that, after which we shall, perhaps, experience yet another acute crisis.
Apart from destroying Britain's monopoly of the world market, the new methods of communication— the electric telegraph, the railways, the Suez Canal and the supplanting of sail by steam — have gone some way towards breaking down the ten-year industrial cycle.
If China is opened up, not only will overproduction risk losing its last safety-valve, but emigration from China will assume such massive propor­ tions that this alone will suffice to revolutionise conditions of produc­ tion throughout America, Australia and India, even to the extent of affecting Europe — if it lasts itself till then.
Bismarck's folly is indeed becoming excessive.
But it has one recur­ ring theme — more moneyl His craziest schemes always and infallibly involve the voting of subsidies, and the National-Liberal gents243 seem to have a positive passion for providing him with yet more cash.
Another victory in France.
Camélinat's question 3 about Deca-zeville 545 provoked a three-day debate, while on Saturday,13 7 mo­ tions to proceed to the Order of the Day were thrown out, until finally the government and the Radical gents429 agreed a resolu­ tion c unprecedented in French parliamentary history and which was passed on Monday564: That this Chamber proceed to the Order of the Day, confident that the Government will move all the necessary amendments to mining legislation and that its conduct in Decazeville will be dictated by the rights of the State and the interests of Labour.
The rights of Labour—it's absolutely unheard-of! And as if that was not enough, a decision unfavourable to the company which is wholly dependent on a state concession and now sees the terms of that concession turned against itself.
All this, of course, is still on paper, a See Z.

but for a first step it's enough.
The whole political situation in France has been revolutionised by the initiative of the three working men.
The Radicals, who also call themselves socialists and who are, in fact, the representatives of French national socialism, of what survives of Proudhon and Louis Blanc, but who, as ministerial candidates, must make sure of keeping in with the republican bourgeoisie, are now compelled to show themselves in their true colours.
The cool, almost hostile attitude they adopted from the outset towards the labour deputies, has shown the mass of the workers what is what; suddenly the latter see, alongside the 'eddicated' Radicals, genuine working-class so­ cialists whom they joyously acclaim.
The Radicals, incl.
Clemenceau, must either temporarily renounce their ministerial aspirations and follow in Basly's and Camélinat's footsteps, or jeopardise their re­ election.
All of a sudden the question of capital and labour is included in the agenda, albeit as yet in very elementary form (rates of pay, the right to strike and, possibly, mining on a cooperative basis), but nevertheless it's there and there to stay.
Since the workers of France, however, had received such a first-rate grounding from their history and from the altogether outstanding behaviour of our people during the past 2 years, nothing more was required to spark off the explosion but an event such as the Decazeville strike, combined with the stupid­ ity of the Radicals in including 3 working men in their list of candi­ dates.
Now things will move fast in France.
You'll have seen how afraid the Radicals are from the resolutions taken by the municipal councils of Paris, Lyons, etc.
, to vote money for the Decazeville strik­ ers^ This again is unprecedented.
If that's the state your voice is in, don't go to America.

249 ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 196 IN PARIS London, 20 March 1886 My dear Lafargue, Herewith the cheque for £12.
Yesterday I was again disturbed.
It always happens when there is an urgent task to be done.
Monday'sa vote in the Chamber was a great victory.
b For the first time a French Chamber has sided with labour against capital — greatly against its will! But Basly & Co.
have been valiantly support­ ed by the monarchist gents who, after their relative victory at the polls,447 are in a state of high excitement and evidently believe— notably in their capacity as capitalists, shareholders, etc.
—that they can do anything they please.
Placed as they are between an ultra-monarchist group and the revolutionary workers, they had to plump for the latter.
At least they are Republicans and, after all, low fi­ nance, as represented by the Opportunists and Radicals,429 has no desire to restore the régime of high finance that was toppled with MacMahon and Thiers.
463 It was what I suspected—this reappearance of Malon's behind the scenes.
565 A parliamentary party embracing every shade of possibil-ism with Malon for secret leader—what a beautiful dream! The same old Bakuninist tactics which, so far as these intriguers are concerned, are now much more deeply ingrained than the bombastic language of anarchism! A firm stand must be made against these endeavours.
If you can ensure that Basly and Camélinat —even on their own—carry on as they have begun and refuse to let themselves be persuaded to join a party where they would form an impotent minority, then the game is won.
Any negotiations on their part would be the ruin of them and could only further the Radical cause.
So long as they go forward with a firm tread and pay no heed to the honeyed words of the moderators of 15 March -b See previous letter.
and mediators, all this confusion will be swept away, like it or not.
It is not good will that activates these gentry; rather it is fear and fear alone that has created such little good will as they have and this, when all is said and done, is the good will to spoil what Basly has begun and nothing else.
Moreover such a party is out of the question.
Either Basly or Camélinat will turn traitor, which I don't believe, or they will be forced to part company with these gentry as soon as the first important problem arises.
It would therefore be better not to en­ ter into an alliance with them.
Your article in the Revue nouvelle* gave me much pleasure.
Obviously one makes some 'ALLOWANCE' for what you are permitted to say in a periodical of that kind.
Even so, I was surprised at the num­ ber of risqué allusions you were allowed to get away with—but she b is a woman, she has a definite standpoint.
Had the editor-in-chief been a man, you would have found yourself up against a much more fero­ cious brand of morality.
566 What with the Journal des Economistes, the Revue philosophique and Juliette, you are now well launched in lit­ erature of a primarily official nature.
567 And since you write better French (because more 16th-century and less Parisian) than others, you ought to succeed.
Juliette amused me much with her high foreign policy.
568 This is Blowitz to the life, though less grotesque in form.
Fortunately the SOCIALIST LEAGUE 346 is dormant for the time being.
Our good Bax and Morris, craving to do something (if only they knew what?), are restrained only by the fact that there is absolutely nothing to do.
Moreover they have far more truck with the anarchists than is desirable.
Their celebrations on the 18th were held in concert with the latter569 and Kropotkin spoke there—twaddle, or so they tell me.
All this will pass, if only because there is absolutely nothing to be done over here just now.
But with Hyndman, who is well versed in political imposture and capable of all sorts of folly when his self-advancement is at stake—with the said Hyndman on the one hand and our two political babes in arms on the other, prospects are by no means bright.
Yet now we have socialist papers abroad proclaiming at the top of their voices that socialism in England is a P.

571 Here again we have something that does credit to the movement and this is the impression it gives from beginning to end.
Even Liebknecht was quite his old self again; competition from the French seems to have had a good effect on him.
a I like the spec­ tacle of the whole gang—or pack of dogs ramer —crowding round you barking and snapping, only to be beaten off by the lash of a whip.
What a mercy that, apart from you and Liebknecht, only Vollmar spoke a word or two, and that Singer, the victim of a concerted at­ tack, was compelled to hit back hard, while the tractable majority held their tongues.
The gentlemen's fears about regicide are too ludicrous.
Surely they or their fathers have all of them sung: Has ever man had such hard luck As our poor Burgomaster Tschech, He shot at Fatty two paces away And yet his bullet went astray.

True, the German bourgeoisie still had some vitality in those days; another example of the difference is that 1844 saw the appearance of Das Lied von Freifrau von Droste-Vischering, 572 whereas now the Kultur­ kampf 162 is being waged with the most humdrum weapons wielded by the most flaccid hands.
The socialists here have been acquitted.
538 I am sending you to­ day's copy of the highly Conservative Standard (also a Cri du Peuple) containing an account of the final hearing.
" You will be able to see from it how a judge goes about his business in England (though ad­ mittedly not in Ireland}.
).
Translated from legal jargon, what he said was: The law on seditious speeches applies to the accused, but the law is outdated and invalid in practice.
Otherwise you would have to convict every radical spokesman and minister.
All you have to ask yourselves, therefore, is this: Was it, or was it not, the intention of the accused that there should be looting on 8 February? b And Cave is one of England's 16 principal judges.
The verdict is a fine advertisement for Hyndman, but it has come too late.
He has contrived to ruin his organisation beyond hope of re­ pair; in London it's fizzling out, while in the provinces the various or­ ganisations have adopted a neutral, wait-and-see attitude to the rifts down here.
Summa summarum the two organisations—FEDERATION and LEAGUE 346—have a combined paid-up membership of less than 2,000 and their papers0 a combined readership of less than 5,000—the majority being sympathisers in the persons of bourgeois, priests, literati, etc.
As things are now, it is truly fortunate that these im­ mature elements are failing to penetrate the masses.
They must first complete the process of fermentation, after which all may be well.
For the rest, one might almost be back in the days of the Interna­ tional.
Only this morning a whole stack of German, French, Spanish and Belgian papers arrived and are taking up time I ought to be de­ voting to the English translation of Capital.
56 I only hope there isn't a bust-up before I've managed to finish the 3rd volume—after that it can come, so far as I'm concerned.

terday) which I am sending you today how skilfully those Parisians, who have been decried as revolutionary braggarts, contrive without relinquishing their revolutionary posture to advocate calm and law­ fulness during the strike.
It is indicative of the progress the French have made, thanks to the revolutionary soil on which they stand, that in their case there is a complete absence of that mass of sophistries and second thoughts which still confuse the minds of so many people in Germany.
That one should proceed lawfully or unlawfully, depend­ ing on the circumstances, is taken entirely for granted over there and no one sees anything inconsistent in it.
As to Paris, it is significant that up till yesterday the Cri du Peuple had raised 35,000 frs for Decaze-ville, but Rochefort's Intransigeant less than 11,000.
Bismarck, who appears to have been in a frightful rage, though ob­ viously speaking for the benefit of the Crown Prince,a will doubtless get a reply from Laura and Tussy to the ludicrous insinuations he made about Marx.
573 Of the other speeches, Hänel's b was the best from a legal viewpoint; he came out with the absurd demand that a citizen should conform to the law not only outwardly but also in­ wardly—that such a thing should be called for, that the mere intention and the public expression thereof, could be held punishable by depri­ vation of rights shows how debased all middle-class concepts of legal­ ity have become in Germany—not that they have ever prevailed over there save in the case of the oppositional bourgeoisie; what has, in fact, always prevailed is the illegality of a police state, which in other countries (always excepting Ireland) could only assert itself shamefacedly and in the guise of a coup de main.

But then there is another hitch.
Edward has missed translating some 50 pages of his share, and these I hope to get by the end of the week.

It is we that can afford to wait, and we intend to wait until we are quite ready to begin to print, say in a week.
And as we have a written offer from another firm, we can stick to our terms.
This must serve as an excuse for my last short letter39 and the de­ lay that has taken place since.
The fact is we must begin to print by middle of May so as to be ready to publish by end of September.
And that we can, though it will keep me hard at work till far into June at least.
Your billet-doux to Bismarck573 is making great stir in Germany.
Bebel writesb: 'Die Erklärung von Laura und Eleanor Marx ist famos, der grösste Teil der deut­ schen Presse nimmt davon Notiz, hütet sich selbstverständlich sie abzudrucken.
Otto wird wütend sein, für dergleichen Angriffe ist er sehr empfindlich.
' 0 The effect of the new departure in France574 is plainly visible in the debate on the Socialist Law in Berlin.
57 ' Library d would hardly have ventured to come out so strongly again in his best old manner, had it not been that events in Paris and Decazeville 545 had stirred him up again a bit.
This competition is invaluable for our people in Germany.
The split and dissensions in Paris gave the philistine sec­ tion amongst them a pretext for looking down, de haut en bas, upon the French, as if they, themselves, had not wallowed for years in splits, quarrels and dissensions; and they began to talk as if they, the Ger­ man kleinbürgerliche" section of the party, were the leaders of the universal movement.
That precious bit of chauvinism has now been effectually knocked on the head.
Unfortunately the Socialist Law has this one effect that it excludes pretty effectually the circula­ tion of such papers as the Socialiste and Cri du Peuple, and that the daily, current information about France has to be taken from the vile aSee this volume, p.

I have sent on the Cris and Intransigeants you sent me, to Bebel and Liebknecht but that does not go much further and may not always reach them.
It strikes me as very curious that I see nothing of the Villefranche judgment being appealed against.
575 As far as I know there is a double appeal 1) on account of the alleged incompetency of the court, 2) against the judgment as such; and then a final pourvoi en cassation* on both these issues.
It seems to me well worth while to go in for that, if only to expose the infamy of the courts and keep the thing before the public.
I scarcely dare hope that Roche will get in next Sunday.
576 Not having read any Cris for about a week, I do not know what other can­ didates besides Gaulier are in the field.
But anyhow the poll will show a great progress and be enough to frighten the Radicals 429 still more.
Here all is muddle.
Bax and Morris are getting deeper and deeper into the hands of a few anarchist phraseurs, and write nonsense with in­ creasing intensity.
The turning of The Commonweal into a 'weekly' — absurd in every respect — has given Edward a chance of getting out of his responsibility for this now incalculable organ.
577 Bax à la re­ cherche^ by means of half-digested Hegelian dialectic, of extreme and paradox propositions, and Morris going head foremost, bull fashion, against 'parliamentarism', will have to learn by experience what sort of people their anarchist friends are.
It would be ridiculous to expect the working class to take the slightest notice of these various vagaries of what is by courtesy called English Socialism, and it is very fortu­ nate that it is so: These gentlemen have quite enough to do to set their own brains in order.
Schorlemmer who is here, and Nim have taken little Lily to the Zoo, Pumps is going to Manchester for a few days.
In our evening chats we talk a good deal of your promised coming over to London.
When is that to be? Schorlemmer says you had mentioned something about Paul coming over at the same time.
That would be all the bet­ ter.
Anyhow it is getting time that these good intentions set about de­ veloping into more or less tangible plans and projects, the season for execution is not too long in this blessed climate.

In most cases the notes contained in the ms.
are the same as those Marx made in his copy for the 3rd edition.
526 In the case of those which provide for more insertions from the French, I would not com­ mit myself unequivocally 1 ) because the work done for the 3rd edition is of much later date and hence, for me, more authoritative, 2) because, in respect of a translation to be made in America, i.

outside his own orbit, Marx might have preferred some of the passages to be translated correctly from the simplified French version rather than incorrectly from the German — a consideration which no longer applies.

The Volkszeitung and Sozialist are now arriving regularly.
Over the past fortnight I have sent you To-Day and Commonweal, March and April.
Also yesterday To-Day, May, the delay being due solely to the slovenliness of the publishers.
Should you require anything else let me know.
Broadhouse (Hyndman)'s translation of Capital is a complete farce.
527 The 1st chapter was from the German, full of mistakes to the point of absurdity.
a Now he's translating from the French, and mak­ ing the same mistakes.
At the rate it's now going, the thing won't be finished before 1900.
Thanks for the Kalender.
I certainly had no idea that Douai was so grossly neglected a great man.
579 May he take with him to the grave the knowledge of his greatness as of its total neglect, without first see­ ing it compressed into a sugar mould.
But he was the right man for America and, had he remained an ordinary Democrat, I should have wished him the best of luck.
As it was, however, he went whoring af­ ter false gods.
As for the purist who quibbles about our style and our punctuation he doesn't know either German or English, otherwise he could not discover Anglicisms where there aren't any.
580 The German of which he's so enamoured and which was drummed into us at school, with its frightful periodic structure whereby the verb is put right at the end and is separated from its subject by ten miles of subclauses, is a Ger­ man which it has taken me thirty years to unlearn.
This bureaucratic, pedagogical German, which completely ignores the fact that Lessing ever existed, is now on its last legs even in Germany.
What would this worthy say were he to hear our people speaking in the Reichstag? Having done away with this horrible syntax because forever getting bogged down in it, they expressed themselves in that place like Jews b: 'Faced with this dilemma, Bismarck chose to kiss the pope's behind rather than the lips of the revolution', etc.
Little Lasker was respon­ sible for this improvement and it's the only good thing he ever did.
Were the purist gent to go to Germany with his pedagogical German, he would be told that he spoke American.
'You know how petty your educated German philistine is' — especially so in America, it would seem.

I think I wrote and told you that an American ladya married to a Russianb has taken it into her head to translate my old book.
c I have looked over the translation and this entailed a lot of work.
But she had written to say that publication was assured and that I must do it at once, so I had to buckle to.
It now transpires that she had en­ trusted the negotiations to a Miss Foster, secretary of a WOMEN'S RIGHTS society, who had been foolish enough to give the thing to the Socialist Labor Party.
550 I told the translator what I thought of this,d but the damage had been done.
For the rest, I am glad that these folk aren't translating anything of mine — a fine mess they'd make of it.
Their German is bad enough, let alone their English! The Volkszeitung people must be pleased with themselves.
They have gained complete control over the movement amongst the Ger­ mans, and business must be flourishing.
That a man like Dietzgen should go to the wall is understandable enough.
529 Playing around with the boycott and minor STRIKES is, of course, far more important than theoretical guidance.
But despite all this, the cause is making enormous strides in America.
For the first time there is a real mass movement amongst the English-speaking population.
That it should still be feeling its way, awkwardly, at random and in ignorance, is inevi­ table.
But all this will right itself; the movement must and will evolve by learning from its own mistakes.
Theoretical ignorance is an at­ tribute of all young nations, but so is speedy practical development.
In America as in England no amount of exhortation will help until the need is really there.
And in America it is there, as is a growing aware­ ness of it.
The entry of the indigenous working masses into the move­ ment in America is for me one of the great events of 1886.
581 As for the Germans over there, let the presently prosperous kind gradually assimilate with the Americans — they'll still be a step or two ahead of the latter and a nucleus will nevertheless remain which will still retain a theoretical grasp of the nature and progress of the movement as a whole, will keep the process of fermentation going and, eventually, rise to the top again.
The second great event of 1886 is the formation of a workers' party in the French Chamber by Basly and Gamelinat, two working-class deputies who, for appearances' sake, were included in the list and given a leg up by the Radicals,429 but failed to play the game and, in-" Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky -b Lazar Wischnewetzky -c The Condition of the Working-Class in England; see this volume, pp.

stead of becoming the servants of the Radical gents, took the floor as working men.
The Decazeville STRIKE545 brought to a head the split between them — they were joined by "5 other deputies — and the Rad­ icals.
3 The latter were thus forced to spell out their policy to the workers and, since it is only thanks to the Radicals that the govern­ ment exists, this was highly distasteful, for it meant that they were rightly held responsible by the workers for everything done by the government.
In short, the Radicals, Clemenceau et al, behaved con­ temptibly, with a result which no amount of exhortation had hitherto succeeded in bringing about, namely the defection of the French workers from the Radicals.
And a further result was the uniting of all socialist groups for the purpose of joint action.
Only the miserable Possibil-ists 2 3 7 held aloof, in consequence of which they are steadily going to pieces.
This NEW DEPARTURE has been tremendously helped along by the government's foolishness, notably its attempt to raise a loan of 900 million frs for which purpose it needed the big financiers, while the latter, being also shareholders in Decazeville, refused their money un­ less the government broke the STRIKE.
Hence the arrest of Due and Roche 575; the workers' riposte was to put up Roche in Paris as a can­ didate (for the Chamber) in next Sunday's elections and Due (Quercy) as a candidate for the municipal council, where he is certain to get in.
576 In short, France can again boast a splendid movement, and this is making spanking progress but, best of all, our men, Guesde, Lafargue and Deville, are its theoretical leaders.
Nor has it been without repercussions in Germany.
The revolution­ ary language and actions of the French have shown how lacklustre are the jeremiads of your Geisers, Vierecks, Auers & Co.
, which is why, in the recent Anti-Socialist Law debate, only Bebel and Lieb­ knecht spoke, and very well too.
57 ' After this debate we can show our faces in' decent company again, which is something we can by no means do after all of them.
On the whole, it's a good thing that Ger­ man pre-eminence should not remain altogether unchallenged, espe­ cially now that so many philistine elements have been elected (inevi­ table though this may have been).
In Germany, when times are quiet, there is a general tendency to philistinism, and then the spur of French competition is absolutely indispensable.
Nor will it be lacking.
From being a sect, French socialism has suddenly become a party and See this volume, p.
409.
only now and because of this has it become possible for the workers to join en masse, for the latter are sick to the teeth of sectarianism, which explains why they adhered to the extreme bourgeois party, the Radi­ cals.
Next Sunday's elections should already see a great step forward, although we can hardly expect Roche to get in.
I believe that the printing of the English translation of Capital, Volume I, will begin in 2 or 3 weeks' time.
I haven't nearly finished revising it, but 300 pages are completely ready for the press, and another 200 very nearly so.
One more thing.
Not long ago a Mr J.
T.
McEnnis interviewed me for the purpose of seeking my advice on labour legislation, osten­ sibly on behalf of the State of Missouri.
I soon smelt a journalistic rat and, indeed, he admitted working for THE LEADING DEMOCRATIC PAPER OF St Louis," but promised on his word of honour that he would first sub­ mit the whole thing to me for revision.
The fellow was sent to see me by a Russian, Stepnyak.
That was nearly a fortnight ago and I am afraid he may not have kept his word.
I have forgotten the name of the St Louis paper, but if anything should appear about the interview, I would ask you to insert the following statement13 in the Sozial­ ist, the Volkszeitung and anywhere else you think fit.
If, however, the fellow comes back after all and abides by his word, I.

Sorge und Andere, Stuttgart, 1906 first time 255 ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 196 IN PARIS [Excerpt] [London,] 7 May 1886 I congratulate you on Sunday's victory which has indeed confirm­ ed the severance of the Parisian working man from radicalism.
576 What idiots those Radicals are! But it is the fatal idiocy that seizes hold of any bourgeois party as soon as it finds itself on the threshold of power and thus loses the characteristics of an opposition party.
They are impatient to take over the administration, although they know that the moment has not yet come; they play at running a shadow government, but nevertheless become responsible for the follies and faults of the government of the day.
At the same time they are con­ fronted by the Workers' Party 20 ' growing from day to day as a result of the follies of the government the responsibility for which they can only partially disclaim.
The Workers' Party will no longer accept fine words and promises; it will call upon them to act and this they can­ not do.
While wanting to retain it, they are compelled to act against it.
Being not, as yet, in power and finding that the masses are desert­ ing them in increasing numbers, they are reduced to pointing a finger at the monarchist conspirators, to representing them as a real danger, to uttering the cry: Let us unite to save the Republic, in short, to becoming Opportunists.
2 3 6 Any party is lost if tries to assume power before the time is ripe for the imple­ mentation of its own programme.
But the impatience of the bourgeois par­ ties to arrive is such that all founder prematurely on this rock.
That gives us even less time in which to develop.
On the other hand our movement in Paris has entered a phase in which even a blunder would do it no great harm.
There can be no doubt that the rate of progress in the future will largely depend upon the group leaders.
But once the masses are on the move, they will be like a healthy body that is strong enough to eliminate traces of dis­ ease and even a modicum of poison.

115, Printed according to the newspaper Paris, 24 novembre 1900 Translated from the French 256 ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT 521 [IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG 34] London, 12 May 1886 Dear Liebknecht, The French papers (of which I have sent at least 3 parcels) were simply intended to give you an opportunity of reading at first hand some of the news about the brilliant turn things have taken in France.
Since you take the Cri du Peuple, I need only send you the Intran­ sigeant, etc.
Lafargue sends me one now and again, when something happens, and I thought that in this way they could be turned to further account.
As regards Clemenceau, the moment may very well come when you would do better to drop La Justice.
He is being pushed over onto the conservative, markedly bourgeois, side by, on the one hand, the immediate prospect of a ministerial post, and, on the other, by the to him unexpectedly rapid growth of the Workers' Party.
2 ° ' Even from his own point of view he is behaving stupidly.
But that's how all these bourgeois are, even the most progressive.
Longuet will soon have to choose, if he doesn't want to ruin himself utterly.
Gaulier's candida­ ture, supported solely by the press unaided by the comités radicaux-socialistes, cost the Radicals 429 50,000 voters who have come over to us and are now the loudest in their denunciation of their one-time chiefs.
576 In the absence of colossal blunders — the movement is al­ ready strong enough now to absorb minor errors without damage to itself—we shall obtain between lj4 and l/3 of the seats at the next elections in Paris.
And, now that they have something real to do, our people are behaving in quite exemplary fashion.
But to write for Justice without being paid is stupid.
The paper is perfectly well able to pay; after all, its chief editors — deputies — are paid by the State.
Bebel has written to say that his voice is apt to give out after several days of exertion, and needless to say I told him that for an American STUMP tour the very first prerequisite was a voice that is proof against anything.
a Whether he's not making too much of the business, I na­ turally cannot say, but it would in any case be quite a risk; once you're over there, you yourself will discover soon enough what the Yan­ kees demand in return for their good money.
If he doesn't go, you must at any rate make sure that no one of the tame, petty-bourgeois breed is sent with you.
518 No doubt the Chicago affair582 will put paid to the anarchist farce in America.
The chaps can shout their heads off if they want, but pointless rowdyism is something the Americans refuse to put up with, now they have become an industrial nation.
There's nothing favourable to report of the so-called 'movement' over here.
Hyndman loses more ground every day, having completely forfeited the confidence of his own people, and the LEAGUE346 is in­ creasingly coming under anarchist leadership.
Since The Common­ weal became a weekly — without adequate supplies either of money or talent — Aveling has had to resign his (honorary) editorship in fa­ vour of Bax who, like Morris, is strongly influenced by the anar­ chists.
577 The two gentlemen will have to learn in corpore vile h\ they'll soon be sick of it and it's a real stroke of luck that these teeth­ ing troubles will have been left behind before the masses join the movement, which at present they obstinately refuse to do.
It's just as it was in France; a really big working class cannot be got moving by ex­ hortation, but when things have reached the right stage, the least im­ pulse is enough to precipitate an avalanche.
And that's what will happen over here as well, and soon.

NESTLER & MELLE'S VERLAG 583 IN HAMBURG [Draft] [London,] 13 May 1886 Dear Sirs, Greatly flattered though I am by the offer you made me in your kind note of the 10th inst.
, I regret that I must nevertheless decline it on the grounds that I cannot spare the time.
I am responsible for editing the mss.
left by Marx and for turning to account all the other papers he left.
It is a responsibility that will occupy my time for several years to come and must take precedence over everything else.
In addition, I am responsible for revising the translations of our works into foreign languages — an essential task in the majority of cases.
Not only is there the English translation of Capital, which I must now finish and which goes to the printers next month,56 but also a constant influx of mss.
of the kind that call for revision, transla­ tions of shorter works into French, Italian, Danish, Dutch, etc.
,a and these take up all that remains of my spare time.
See this volume, p.
394.
But once I have put all this behind me, I shall, assuming I live so long, first have to turn my mind to the completion, once and for all, of my own independent works which have been totally neglected for the past three years.
Among those whose views correspond to my own, my friend Karl Kautsky would no doubt be suitable for such a position, especially as he now lives here, and I should be glad to give him all the help I could.
Moreover the relevant English literature, most of it quite un­ known, is obtainable nowhere save in the BRITISH MUSEUM.
Yesterday, fherefore, I took the liberty of informing him of your proposal.
But his commitments — apart from editing the Neue £eit —are so many and extend so far ahead that he was unable to authorise my suggesting him to you as a candidate.
I am, as you can see, most interested in your scheme and hence am all the sorrier for being unable to participate in its execution.
Mean­ while I would thank you for honouring me with your proposal, and remain Yours faithfully First published in: Marx and Engels, Printed according to the original Works, First Russian Edition, Vol.

Remarkable speech by Lord Randolph Churchill,a brother of the Duke of Marlborough, democratising Tory, Secretary for India in the last Tory Cabinet, and as such a life member of the PRIVY COUNCIL.
In view of our petty-bourgeois socialists' insipid and pusillanimous protests and assurances to the effect that, whatever the circumstances, they will pursue their objectives by peaceful means, this is surely the moment to point out that English ministers — Althorp, Peel, Morley, and even Gladstone—are advocating the right to revolt as a theory consistent with the Constitution, though admittedly only for such time as they remain in opposition, as Gladstone's subsequent vapourings have borne out,b though in none of them did he dare deny that right as such — and especially, too, because this emanates from England, the land of legality par excellence.
Our Vierecks could hardly have had shorter shrift.
I'm glad to see from the Sozialdemokrat's renewed verve that you are in good shape again.
I'm up to my eyes in the English translation of Capital.
Aveling fixed up everything with the publishers mis morning and the contract will be signed in a day or two, after which comes the printing, 5 sheets a week minimum.
56 Unfortunately I haven't finished revising it, but pp.
1-450 of the original are ready for the press; ditto, almost, pp.
450-640.
But please don't make any announcement yet, as nothing has been signed so far.
Our Frenchmen are doing splendidly.
Over here, on the other hand, everyone is playing about like a bunch of amateurs.
The anar­ chist follies in America 582 may prove advantageous; it is undesirable that the American workers, given their present wholly bourgeois level of thinking — high wages and short hours — should win victories too quickly.
That might unduly reinforce the biassed TRADES UNION spirit.
The most powerful TRADES UNION over here, the AMALGAMATED ENGI­ NEERS, had to allocate from its reserve funds more than £43,000 for its unemployed members, bringing the reserves down from ap-prox.
£165,000 to approx.
£122,000.
Not until this fund is exhaust­ ed, and only then, will it be possible to do something with those chaps.

56 With Kegan Paul and Co.
it was impossible to come to a satisfactory conclusion, so we ar­ ranged terms with Swan Sonnenschein and Co.
I saw Swan Sonnen­ schein yesterday, with Edward, and there is now only the agreement to be signed formally and then the ms.
will go to press at once.
Swan Sonnenschein and Co.
pay us 10% of gross selling price first 500 copies sold and I2 ll2% all following copies.
First edition to be a library one, at 32/-in 2 volumes: the type to be clichéd at once but so that al­ terations for 2nd edition can be made within certain limits; then sec­ ond edition in one volume say from 7/6 to 10/-, and this plan will suit us much better than Kegan Paul's who would have kept the price up at 28/-and thus excluded the book from general circulation.
As I have 450 pages (of the original German) ready to go to press, and about 200 more that can be got ready in 14 days, and all the rest done in the rough, there is no reason why we should not print 5 sheets a week and have done altogether by middle of August, and the book to be brought out 1st October.
I think Paul does not quite see why they wanted a letter from him on the Paris election for The Commonweal.
The people here do not want directly to attack Justice and moreover their assertion would not go half as far as an authoritative statement from Paris.
585 But it's no great matter, as the League 346 is in a complete muddle through their having let the anarchists creep in.
They will have their conference of delegates on Whit Sunday,586 and then we shall see what comes of it.
I cannot make out why Decazeville collapsed so suddenly,587 es­ pecially as Paul, like Napoleon after the burning of Moscow, all at once ceased to supply Cris du Peuple to me, at the critical moment.
Is it so absolutely impossible for the Parisian mind to own to unpleasant things that can't be helped? The victory of Decazeville would have been exceedingly nice, but after all the defeat may be more useful to the movement in the long run.
So I do believe, too, that the anarchist follies of Chicago will do much good.
582 If the present American mo­ vement— which so far as it is not exclusively German, is still in the Trades Union stage — had got a great victory on the 8 hours ques­ tion, Trades Unionism would have become a fixed and final dogma.
While a mixed result will -help to show then that it is necessary to go beyond 'high wages and short hours'.

W.
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, I have looked over the proofs and corrected in pencil a few addi­ tional mistakes.
That the set-up of the work would be anything but elegant, I fore­ saw as soon as I knew who had it in charge, and am therefore not much surprised.
I am afraid there is no help now, so it's no use grum­ bling.
Whatever the mistakes and the Borrmrthdt of the leaders of the move­ ment, and partly of the newly-awakening masses too, one thing is certain: the American working class is moving, and no mistake.
And after a few false starts, they will get into the right track soon enough.
This appearance of the Americans upon the scene I consider one of the greatest events of the year.
581 What the downbreak of Russian Czarism would be for the great military monarchies of Europe—the snapping of their mainstay — that is for the bourgeois of the whole world the breaking out of class war in America.
For America after all was the ideal of all bourgeois: a country rich, vast, expanding, with purely bourgeois institutions unleavened by feudal remnants or mo­ narchical traditions, and without a permanent and hereditary prole­ tariat.
Here every one could become, if not a capitalist, at all events an independent man, producing or trading, with his own means, for his own account.
And because there were not, as yet, classes with oppos­ ing interests, our — and your—bourgeois thought that America stood above class antagonisms and struggles.
That delusion has now broken down, the last Bourgeois Paradise on earth is fast changing into a Purgatory, and can only be prevented from becoming, like Eu­ rope, an Inferno by the go-ahead pace at which the development of the newly fledged proletariat of America will take place.
The way in which they have made their appearance on the scene, is quite extra­ ordinary: six months ago nobody suspected anything, and now they appear all of a sudden in such organised masses as to strike terror into the whole capitalist class.
I only wish Marx could have lived to see it! I am in doubt whether to send this to Zurich or to the address in Paris you give at foot of your letter.
But as in case of mistake Zurich is safest, I forward this and the proofs to Mr Schlüter, who no doubt will forward wherever it may be necessary.
Ever sincerely yours, F.

593 I couldn't, alas, if only because 1) I am tied down in England through having to attend to the proof-correction and publication of the English translation of Capital which is now printing 56; nor could I leave this to anyone else even if I were not bound by my contract.
2) For the past 3 months, however, I have again become an in­ valid, 200 or 300 paces being the most I can manage, and am depen­ dent on all sorts of medical persons; the business is just gênant, a no more, but at any moment complications might set in if I didn't take things easy, so there can be no question of a long journey.
And even if, as I hope, I am more mobile this autumn, I really must do my ut­ most this time to rid myself for good of this old trouble by which I have been crippled off and on during the past three years, and that means doing nothing that might bring about a relapse.
I simply must get to the stage of being able to walk for 2 or 3 hours on end, other­ wise I shall be done for and unable to do any sustained work.
I had thought that, during the past fortnight, I might get to the stage of being able to register a positive improvement, but it's taking longer than I imagined.
Well, with luck we might be able to make some other arrangement.
For once in Paris, you might just as well cross the Channel and spend a little while here.
I would gladly bear the cost, and your stay over here wouldn't cost you a penny.
In August I am being sent to the sea­ side to recuperate and in September I shall have visitors from the provinces, from Germany and most likely also the Lafargues from Paris and, since I only have one spare room, putting up all these people will a inconvenient be none too easy.
But in October it will all be over and I shall be able to let you have the room any time you like, and should be delighted to see you here.
Then we could also talk things over and exchange all our news at greater leisure than in Paris where, after all, one is never on one's own.
So make up your mind.
By October, too, my urgent work will be so far advanced that I shall be able to shelve everything else; I also hope to have made sufficient progress to tipple again.
If, by the by, you would rather come here in September, let me know; either way, I'm sure it can be managed.
There are all sorts of things that still remain to be discussed and, above all, you have so much information — known, as you say, to no one else — about the historical origins of the movement to pass on to me, that it would be a crying shame if we didn't do our utmost to foregather once again and get all this off our chests.
I haven't yet had a chance to put Marx's papers in order, a job that would take me at least a month.
Perhaps I shall get round to it in the autumn, for done it has got to be, and done before the days grow too short.
I am taking out another five pound money order for you which I hope will reach you soon after, or at the same time as, this letter.
So do make up your mind.
I look forward immensely to seeing you again and discussing things with you face to face.
If I were as steady on my pins as you, I should come to Geneva — but as it is! Well, I expect you to do it in my stead, and come over here.

Published in English tor the first time 271 ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY IN ZURICH Eastbourne, 13-14 August 1886 4 Cavendish Place Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, My reply to your kind letter of the 9th June was delayed for the simple reason that overwork compelled me to suspend all my corre­ spondence (such as did not command immediate despatch) until the ms.
of the translation of Das Kapital was finally ready for the print­ er.
56 Such is now the case, and I can at last attend to the heap of unanswered letters before me; and you shall have the first chance.
Had you told me in the above letter that you had spare time on your hands for party work, I should at once have sent you a short reply; I am sorry if through my fault you were prevented from doing some useful work.
I quite forgot, when proposing to you Lohnarbeit und Kapital, a that an English translation had already appeared in London.
As this is offered for sale in New York it would be useless to translate it over again.
a K.
Marx, Wage Labour and Capital.
Now about Der Ursprung.
a The thing is more difficult to translate than Die Lage, b and would require comparatively greater attention and more time per page on your part.
But if I had time left to me for the looking it over, that would be no obstacle, provided you could devote that time and attention to it, and leave me a larger margin of blank paper to suggest alterations.
There is however another matter to consider.
If the thing is to come out in English at all, it ought to be published in such a way that the public can get hold of it through the regular book-trade.
That will not be the case, as far as I can see, with Die Lage.
Unless the trade arrangements are very different in America from those in Europe, the booksellers will not deal in works published by outside establishments belonging to a working men's party.
This is why Chartist and Owenite publications are no­ where preserved and nowhere to be had, not even in the British Mu­ seum; and why all our German party publications are — and were, long before the Socialist Law 37 —not to be had through the trade, and remained unknown to the public outside the party.
That is a state of things which sometimes cannot be avoided, but ought to be avoided wherever possible.
And you will not blame me if I wish to avoid it for English translations of my writings having suffered from it in Germany for more than 40 years.
The state of things in England is such that publishers can be got — either now or in the near future — for socialist works, and I have no doubt that in the course of next year I can have an English translation published here and the translator paid; and as I have, moreover, long since prom­ ised Dr Aveling the translation of the Entwicklung 528 and Ur­ sprung, 606 if he can make it pay for himself, you see that an Ameri­ can edition, brought out outside the regular book-trade, would only spoil the chance of a London edition to be brought out in the way of the regular trade and therefore accessible to the public generally and everywhere.
Moreover I do not think that this book is exactly what is wanted at the present moment by the American working men.
Das Kapital will be at their service before the year is out, that will serve them for a pièce de résistance.
c For lighter, more popular literature, for real propaganda, my booklet will scarcely serve.
In the present undevel­ oped state of the movement, I think perhaps some of the French po-a F.

Deville and Lafargue have pub­ lished two series of lectures, Cours d'économie sociale, about two years ago, Deville taking the economic and Lafargue the more gen­ eral, historic side of the Marxian theory.

a 14th August To return to the Ursprung.
I do not mean to say that I have abso­ lutely promised Aveling to let him have it, but I consider myself bound to him in case a translation is to come out in London.
The fi­ nal decision, then, would depend very much upon the nature of the publishing arrangements you can make in America.
To a repetition of what Miss Foster has done with Die Lage I decidedly object.
b When I see my way to an English edition, brought out by a firm known in the bourgeois trade, and not only of this book, but prob­ ably of a collection of various other writings, with the advantage of having the translation done here (which saves to me a deal of time) you will admit that I ought to look twice before sanctioning the bringing out, in America, of this little book alone and thereby spoil­ ing the whole arrangement.
And with the present anti-socialist scare in America, I doubt whether you will find regular publishers very willing to associate their names with socialist works.
A very good bit of work would be a series of pamphlets stating, in popular language, the contents of Das Kapital.
The theory of surplus value No.
1; the history of the various forms of surplus value (coop­ eration, manufacture, modern industry) No.
2; accumulation and the history of primitive accumulation No.
3; the development of surplus value making in colonies [last chapter) No.
4 — this would be espe­ cially instructive in America, as it would give the economical history of that country, from a land of independent peasants to a centre of modern industry, and might be completed by specially American facts.
In the meantime you may be sure that it will take some time yet a G.

And for those that do read and will read, there is matter enough being provided, and least of all will Der Ursprung be missed by them.
With the Anglo-Saxon mind, and especially with the eminently practical development it has taken in America, theory counts for nothing until imposed by dire necessity, and I count above all things upon the teaching our friends will receive by the con­ sequences of their own blunders, to prepare them for theoretical schooling.

Engels to Bernstein.
14 August 1886 467 Meanwhile the situation has been getting more and more critical, for Alexander III is in need of a success after his many setbacks and, in view of the multifarious intrigues, it might well happen that matters get beyond the gentlemen's control and war breaks out.
In this con­ nection I wanted to pass on to you the story sent in by the Daily News correspondent in St Petersburg, which he insists is true despite all disclaimers, that between the 18th and the end of this month six Russian army corps, opposed by six ditto, will be engaged on ma­ noeuvres in the neighbourhood of Vilna, i.
e.
close to the Prussian border; an assemblage, that is, of 12 army corps (the whole German army has only 18 of them) or, at a very modest estimate, 240,000 men.
We may be sure that the vast sum of money involved isn't being chucked down die drain out of sheer bravado.
Moreover Alexander III has forbidden all foreign officers to attend, even Werder, the Prussian.
While these 240,000 men are concentrated on the border, Mr Giers will arrive in Germany to negotiate with Bismarck.
It is a very bold stratagem, especially having regard to old William," for he is being tackled precisely on this, his most sensitive flank.
So things may go wrong and war break out.
It may equally well be settled on the quiet, for we may be sure that Giers will not willingly be a party to such out­ rageous pranks.
However I thought it as well to draw your attention to this curious business.
Tell Schlüter that I shall attend to his piece 5 5 7 as soon as I get back to London.
I may possibly see old Harney before that, in which case I shall be able to glean a good deal of information that will be of interest to him.
Kindest regards.

Engels to Bebel.
18 August 1886 273 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 608 [IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN] Eastbourne, 18 August 1886 4 Cavendish Place Dear Bebel, It is a long time since I sent you word of myself, but on the one hand nothing in particular had happened that seemed to call for an exchange of opinions and, on the other, the ms.
of the translation of Capital* was giving me such an immense amount of work that I had, quite literally and on principle, to let slide all correspondence that did not require immediate attention for about 10 weeks.
Now that, too, has been dealt with, so that all that is pursuing me down to the seaside here are the very troublesome proofs and this means that I shall at last be able to make good my omissions, especially since var­ ious things have happened that are worth writing about.
First and foremost the Freiberg verdicts.
602 It would seem that your German, and notably Saxon, magistrate still deems himself in­ sufficiently depraved.
His case is like that of Eccarius in the days of the International, of whom Pfänder once said: 'You have absolutely no idea what Eccarius is like; he intends to become far worse than he already is.
' And the Saxons are no exception.
In Germany everything official is corrupt, but a petty state gives rise to a particular brand of corruption.
For its semi or wholly hereditary official class is so small and at the same time so jealous of its caste privileges that its judiciary, police, administration and army, all brothers and relatives, come to one another's aid and play into one another's hands, and to such good purpose that the legal norms, indispensable in larger countries, are completely lost to view, and what is utterly impossible becomes possible.
I myself have seen what can happen in this way, not only in Germany but also in Luxembourg and, quite recently, in Jersey, not to mention Switzerland in the bad old Bonapartist days.
b And I am convinced that Bismarck could have achieved the same end in any a the English translation of the first volume of Capital (see Note 56) -b The reference is to Engels' stay in Switzerland in 1849-50.
other petty German state as soon as the Court, the chief of the robber band, ceased to oppose him.
In the largest of the petty states, in Prus­ sia itself, this mutual aid society is formed by the military and official élite and is capable of any infamy in the real or purported interest of the caste.
Just now the ruling clique has more than enough to do.
The death of old Williama will usher in a period of uncertainty and indecision for them — hence, or so they believe, the need to consolidate their po­ sition as much as possible beforehand.
Hence, too, the sudden furious hue and cry which is raised to an even higher pitch by their fury over the complete failure of all their previous machinations against us, and their hope of [provoking] minor disturbances which would make it possible to tighten up the law.
b And that is why you people have got to spend nine months in jug.
I hope you will return from your travels this summer so fortified that those 9 months will not be deleterious to your health.
This, your en­ forced retirement, will prove extremely deleterious to the party; true, the tractable members will at last be made to realise that mildness is no safeguard against imprisonment, yet they are unlikely to change their spots and their endeavour to pass themselves off as the genuine representatives of the party will be facilitated by everything that im­ pedes the organisation, and hence the organised expression of opin­ ion, of our masses.
And once they know you're safely under lock and key, they'll really start to give themselves airs.
Much will then depend on Liebknecht, but upon what will he depend? He will be coming over here in a fortnight's time and will pass on to me a vast amount of party gossip, or as much of it as he thinks fit.
But of one thing you may be sure — my view of the German movement as a whole, of the tactics it should adopt, and of its individual members including Lieb­ knecht himself, will remain what it has always been.
Come to that, I am greatly looking forward to seeing him again, although I know from experience that reasoning with him is a complete waste of time — at most he may take some account of my opinion while in Amer­ ica, where Tussy Aveling will be able to give him an occasional nudge and so keep him on the straight and narrow.
600 As regards the fund-raising success of the tour, I have my doubts.
Now that the American movement is acquiring reality, it is bound to become an ever less productive source of funds for Germany.
This it could only 'a William I -b See this volume, pp.
472-73.
be while still a completely academic proposition.
But now that the Anglo-American workers have been roused from their lethargy, it is essential that in speeches and the press they be helped to take their first, still tentative steps, that a truly socialist nucleus be formed in their midst, and this costs money.
Nevertheless, this time there may still be some pickings to be had.
The entry of the Americans into the movement and the revival of the French movement by the three labour deputies and by Decaze-ville 545 — these are the two events of world historic importance this year.
In America there's all sorts of tomfoolery going on — here the anarchists, there the KNIGHTS OF LABOR 609 — but no matter; the thing has got going and will make rapid progress.
There are still many dis­ appointments in store — the wire-pullers of the old political parties are preparing covertly to take over the leadership of the budding workers' party—and colossal blunders will be made, but neverthe­ less, things will go faster there than anywhere else.
In France the 108,000 votes obtained by Roche 576 prove that the Radicals' spell429 is broken and the Paris workers are beginning to disown them, and to do so on a massive scale.
To consolidate this vic­ tory, this new-won position, our men have managed to transform the temporary organisation set up for Roche's election into a permanent one 6 ' ° and in this way have become the theoretical teachers of the working men who are turning away from the Radicals.
Though they all describe themselves as socialists, these people are learning from bitter experience that the threadbare remnants they have inherited from Proudhon and Louis Blanc are mere bourgeois and petty-bourgeois dross; hence they are proving quite accessible to Marx's theory.
This is a consequence of the Radicals being partially at the helm; once wholly so, they will lose their entire working-class follow­ ing and I maintain that the victory of Radicalism, i.
e.
of old, thread­ bare French socialism, in the Chamber will spell victory for Marxism, to begin with in the Paris municipal council.
Oh, had Marx but lived to see his thesis vindicated in France and America,— his thesis that today's democratic republic is no more than the battleground upon which the decisive struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat will be fought out! For all that,3 practically nothing is yet happening in this country.
a In the original 'trotz alledem und alledem' —a line from a poem by Ferdinand Freiligrath Trotz alledem! 471 Not even a socialist sect, as in Owen's day, can be said to exist.
There are as many sects as there are heads.
The SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERA­ TION 300 does at least have a programme and a certain amount of dis­ cipline, but no backing whatever from the masses.
Its bosses are polit­ ical adventurers of the most ambitious kind, and their paper, Justice, is one long lie about the historic power and importance of the FEDERA­ TION.
Even the worthy Ede occasionally forgets this and inoppor­ tunely cites the paper, thus doing the genuine movement over here more harm than he can make good; from where he is it is difficult for him to assess the way in which Justice exploits this.
The LEAGUE 346 is going through a crisis.
Morris, a sentimental dreamer pure and simple, the personification of good will with so good an opinion of itself that it turns into ill will if ever there's a question of learning anything, has been taken in by the catchword 'Revolution' and fallen victim to the anarchists.
Bax is very talented and no fool but, philosopher-fashion, has concocted his own brand of socialism which he regards as true Marxian theory and with which he does a great deal of harm.
How­ ever, in his case these are merely teething troubles and will soon dis­ appear; only it's a pity the process should have to take place in pub­ lic.
Nor can Aveling learn very much, taken up as he is with working for his livelihood; he is the only one I see regularly.
However, the publication of Capital in English 5 6 will clear the air enormously over here.
And with that I must close if I want to finish this letter.
It is 6.
45, tea is about to be served and the last post goes at 8.
So take care of yourself and mind you don't pay my long silence back in kind.

H.
NESTLER & MELLE'S VERLAG IN HAMBURG [Draft] [London, about 11 September 1886] Dear Sirs, I must categorically reject the insinuation in your favour of the 9th inst.
623 Even had it occurred to Kautsky and, via him, to Dietz, to bring out a similar collection of excerpts simply as a result of the proposal you made me, you could have no cause for complaint, since in your postcard of 15 May you told me: 'We must frankly admit that without you we shall not be able to bring our idea to fruition.
' When you withdrew, they were fully entitled to step in.
And why I should be considered in any way blameworthy in this matter is utterly incomprehensible to me.
However the above assumption is not even correct.
The need for such a collection has long been discussed in socialist circles and pre­ parations to bring one into being have often been all but completed.
I know that Dietz, in particular, has had this in mind ever since he started his firm.
When I spoke to Kautsky about your proposal, one of the reasons he gave for his refusing was that he was already corre­ sponding witii Dietz about a very similar offer and had committed him­ self to Dietz to the extent of being unable to entertain any proposition of a similar nature from elsewhere.
I intimated as much when replying to you,a in so far as it was permissible for me to do so; I was not entitled to say more.
In fact the matter had by then progressed so far that, at the time you wrote to me, Kautsky had already been engaged for several weeks in finishing off the first instalments (on Marx) 137 and hence needed no prompting from you.
Moreover, the appearance of Dietz's advertisement at this precise moment is in no way the result of your letter to me, of which Dietz, so " See this volume, pp.
447-48.
far as I know, is not even aware.
It is solely the result of the fact that Dietz, following his conviction in Freiberg,602 feels impelled to get various schemes of his to a stage at which they can go ahead without his supervision during his six months' detention.
When I was in business I grew accustomed to hearing overhasty criticisms based on insufficient information.
It is one of those philis-tine German customs which make it virtually impossible for Germans to play a really prominent role in the world of business.
But I must confess I am somewhat surprised that a firm of your repute could be capable of this sort of thing.

Published in English lor the first ' time 284 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 13 September 1886 My dear Laura, Here we are again in London 5 " — it's the same thing over and over again, jobs of all sorts.
The last week I had to revise a German extract of the Kapital by Kautsky, 137 and it wanted revising very much.
Two other mss.
are in my desk and have been there for more than six months.
Hope to clear them off this week.
Fortunately for me, proof-sheetsa have been few and far between, else it would have been but a poor holiday for me.
Anyhow I shall now cut this sort of work completely, else I should never get to my chief work.
Tussy and Edward's ship the City of Chicago arrived in New York on the 10th, and Liebknecht's, the Servia, must be there by this time too, as she sailed 4th September.
They will have a severe job to go a of the English translation of the first volume of Capital (see Note 56) through with travelling and speechifying.
600 Liebknecht was four days with us at Eastbourne, he is quite fat and carries a deal of weight in front of himself, no doubt the Yankees will take some of that out of him.
Otherwise he was very jolly and confident as usual: 'alles geht famos'.
* I wrote to you that I had a postcard from Schorlemmer about 18th August from the Lake of Como,b since then I have not heard from him.
Anyhow he is now soon due in Paris whence he has sworn to bring you, and if possible Paul too, over to London.
I sincerely trust that he will succeed, Nim is already busying her mind with the few necessary arrangements which indeed will not require great exer­ tions.
Paul's trial will not I hope prevent him from coming over, 624 the old shop where he likes to buy drawers at l/6d.
a pair is still there if that is an inducement.
And if he cannot get off, surely you are bound to take a holiday too and see your old friends in London once more.
You know what Meyer said: 'wenn sie im £immer kommt, ist es als wenn die Sonne aufginge' c — so do let the sun rise once more over London! Nim has had her photograph taken in Eastbourne, it was very good and is paid for, this is perhaps the reason why the copies are not yet sent.
Please thank Paul for his letter on the wine manufacture — it not only confirmed, but also completed what I had heard from other sources.
It is very satisfactory to know that in these latter days of ca­ pitalist production the phylloxera has smashed up the Château La-ffite, Lagrange and other grands crus, d as we that know how to appre­ ciate them, do not get them, and the Jews and parvenus that get them, do not know [how] to appreciate them.
Having thus no lon­ ger a mission to fulfil, they may as well go to smash, our successors will soon restore them when they are wanted for grand popular holidays.
What Mohr said in the Circular to the International in 1870,e that the annexation of Alsace, etc.
, had made Russia l'arbitre de l'Europe, is now at last becoming evident.
Bismarck has had to cave in comple­ tely, and the will of Russia has to be done.

man Empire, the guardian of European peace, without whose leave not a cannon-shot can be fired, is dispelled, and the German philis-tine finds he is as much the slave of the Czar a as when Prussia was l der fünfte Rad am europäischen Wagen 1 .
b And now he falls foul of Bismarck who after all does only what he is compelled to do.
The rage is great in Germany, not only among the philistines, but also in the army.
Liebknecht says since 1866 there has not been such an outcry against an act of the government.
But there it will not stop.
If the Balkan drama enters its second act, a war between Russia and Austria will break out and then vogue la galère" — all Europe may burst out in flames.
I should be rather sorry — no doubt it would be the last war, and no doubt this as anything else must turn out ultimately to our ad­ vantage.
But it may after all delay our victory and the other road is safer.
For that however there is scarcely another road than a revolu­ tion in Russia, and as long as Alexander a follows the lead of the Pan-Slavists, that is a very unlikely event.
In fact, the decisive argument of Giers with Bismarck was this: we are between Pan-slavists and Nihil­ ists, 356 if we keep the peace they will unite and the palace revolution will be a.
fait accompli — so we must go on towards Constantinople, and this will be less harmful to you, Bismarck and William,d than a Russian revolution.
This winter will decide matters, so I am bound to get the 3rd volumee ready by next spring.
Had several visits from Bax and one from Morris lately — Bax sees the impasse he has got himself into, and would get out if he could do so without a direct recantation, and no doubt will find some way or other.
Morris is a settled sentimental socialist, he would be easily managed if one saw him regularly a couple of times a week, but who has the time to do it, and if you drop him for a month, he is sure to lose himself again.
And is he worth all that trouble even if one had the time? In the meantime Hyndman fortifies his position more and more, because he has a definite programme and a definite line of po­ litical action, to both of which Morris seems to object, his ideal is a debating club uniting all shades.
In all this confusion I expect the principal help from the English Kapital/ 23 sheets are printed and revised, but there is something wrong with the printer, I do not re­ ceive any fresh proofs and cannot get any information as Sonnen­ schein is away for his holiday and nobody can or will tell where the hitch lies.

I, Paris, 1956 285 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL [IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN] London, 13-14 September 1886 Dear Bebel, What I find odd about this whole Bulgarian and oriental busi­ ness 445 is the Russians having only just realised that, as a result of the annexation of Alsace, etc.
, they have become the arbiters of Europe, as indeed was pointed out to the members of the International by Marx as long ago as 1870.
a The only possible explanation for this is the universal adoption since the war (in Russia in 1874) of the Prus­ sian Landwehr system which takes between 10 and 12 years to produce a commensurately powerful army.
474 Russia and France now also possess such an army, hence the fun can now begin.
And that is pre­ cisely why die Russian army, which supplies the hard core of Pan-Slavism, is now exerting such tremendous pressure on the govern­ ment that the Tsarb is faced with only two possibilities — he must ei­ ther overcome his old animosity to the French Republic and enter into alliance with it, or he must persuade Bismarck to endorse Rus­ sia's oriental policy.
For Bismarck and William,0 the alternatives were, either resistance to Russia and the prospect of a Franco-Russian alliance and world war, or the certainty of a Russian revolu­ tion as a result of an alliance between the Pan-Slavs and the Nihi-a K.
Marx, 'Second Address of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association on the Franco-Prussian War'.
-b Alexander III-' William I lists, 356 or again submission to Russia, i.
e.
betrayal of Austria.
That from their own standpoint Bismarck and William could not have act­ ed otherwise, seems obvious to me, and this represents a great leap forward, in that the incompatibility of the Hohenzollerns' interests and those of Germany has now been made plainly and overwhelm­ ingly manifest.
The very existence of the German Empire is being imperilled by its Prussian foundations.
Temporarily — until after the winter, that is,— the affair will prob­ ably be glossed over, but the Pan-Slavs' appetite grows with eating, and they will never have such a favourable opportunity again.
If the Russians succeed in occupying Bulgaria, they will also go on to attack Constantinople, unless insuperable obstacles — say an Austro-German-British alliance — intervene.
Hence Bismarck's desperate plea for an actively anti-Russian policy on Britain's part, a plea he now gets The Standard to re-echo almost daily in the hope that Britain will avert a world war.
At all events, Austrian and Russian rivalry in the Balkan Peninsula is becoming so acute that war is more likely than the preservation of peace.
And that will be the end of localised warfare.
But what the outcome will be — who will win — we cannot say.
The German army is certainly the best and the best-led, but is only one amongst many.
The Austrians are an unknown quantity, both numerically and mili­ tarily, especially as regards leadership, and have always been dab-hands at getting their best troops beaten.
The Russians, as always, are deluding themselves as to their strength which, on paper, is enormous; though exceedingly weak in attack, they are strong in the defence of their own country.
Their weakest point, aside from the high command, is a lack of suitable material to officer the vast masses; the country does not produce the required number of educated peo­ ple.
The Turks are the best soldiers, but the high command is invari­ ably execrable, if not suborned.
Finally, the French are also short of officers, because too politically advanced to tolerate an institution such as that of one-year volunteers; also because the French bourgeois is (personally) utterly unwarlike.
Lastly, the new organisation has never been put to the test anywhere save in Germany.
Hence these quantities are very difficult to estimate, either numerically or qualita­ tively.
Of the Italians, it may be said with certainty that, given equal numbers, they would be beaten by any other army.
But how these var­ ious quantities will group themselves, either with or against each other, in a world war is equally incalculable.
Britain's importance — that of her Navy and that of her vast resources — will grow as the war goes on and, if she withholds her troops at the start, it may, in the end, be a British corps of 60,000 men which finally turns the scales.
All this presupposes that nothing happens inside the countries con­ cerned.
But in France a war might well bring revolutionary elements to /he helm, while in Germany a defeat or the death of the Old Mana might result in a violent change of régime, which in turn might lead to a regrouping of the belligerents.
In short, there will be chaos of which the only certain outcome will be wholesale slaughter on a hith­ erto unprecedented scale, the exhaustion of the whole of Europe to a hitherto unprecedented degree and, finally, the complete collapse of the old system.
Immediate victory for ourselves could only be produced by a revo­ lution in France, which would confer on the French the role of libera­ tors of the European proletariat.
I do not know whether this would be the best thing for the latter; however it would raise ideal French chauvinism to the nth degree.
A revolution in Germany follow­ ing a defeat would be of use only if it led to peace with France.
Best of all would be a Russian revolution which, however, can only be expected after severe defeats have been inflicted on the Russian army.
This much is certain: A war would above all retard our movement all over Europe, completely disrupt it in many countries, stir up chauvinism and xenophobia and leave us with the certain prospect, amongst many other uncertain ones, of having to begin all over again after the war, albeit on a basis far more favourable even than today.
Whether or not there is war, this much has been gained.
Your Ger­ man philistine has been shocked out of his lethargy and at last finds himself compelled to intervene actively in politics.
Since numerous intermediary stages will have to be gone through between today's Prussian Bonapartism with its semi-feudal foundations and the social­ ist republic which will be our first stage, it can only be to our advan­ tage that your German citizen should at last be forced to resume his political responsibilities and oppose the present régime, if only to a William I make it get some sort of move-on.
And so I look forward keenly to see­ ing what happens during the coming session of the Reichstag.
Since I do not get any German papers at the moment, I should be greatly obliged if you would send me some from time to time, when they carry reports of important sittings, particularly those concerned with foreign policy.
Liebknecht, too, had a great deal to say about the indignation pro­ voked in Germany by Bismarck's kow-towing to the Russians.
625 He spent several days with me at the seaside in Eastbourne,599 was in very good spirits and, as always, 'everything was going swimmingly'.
Since the gentlemen of the right wing are no longer stirring up any trouble to speak of and have had to knuckle under, Liebknecht could again give vent to quite revolutionary utterances and do his best to pass himself off as the most resolute of men.
I intimated pretty plainly that I knew more about these goings-on than he might, perhaps, care for but, since he was completely on the right track, there was abso­ lutely no reason why our intercourse should be other than exceedingly cordial.
I am unaware of, and hence not responsible for, anything he may have told you in his letters about the matters he and I discussed.
14 September Having again been interrupted, I must make sure that I finish this in time for the evening post so that you get this letter by Thursdaya morning at the latest.
The Hungarian parliament will also be con­ vening in the near future when the Bulgarian affair445 is sure to be brought up.
The best thing for us would be for Russia to be peacefully or forcibly repulsed, in which case the stage would be set for revolu­ tion there.
The Pan-Slavs would join in, only to find next morning that they had been duped.
This was a point upon which Marx always expressed himself with the greatest conviction — and I know of no one who understood Russia, both as regards internal and external matters, as well as he.
He maintained that, as soon as the old régime had been destroyed in Russia, no matter by whom, and a representa­ tive assembly had convened, no matter of what kind, Russia's policy of aggression would cease and domestic questions take precedence over everything else.

stronghold of reaction had been destroyed, would, he said, be tre­ mendous; we in Germany would be the first to feel them.
Liebknecht's ship arrived in New York yesterday morning at 3 o'clock, that of the Avelings several days earlier.
600 If it's as hot there as it is here — now, at 4 in the afternoon it's 25 degrees Centi­ grade3 here in my room — their tub-thumping is going to make them sweat a bit.
In France the good work still goes on.
The method of agitation that was tried out at Decazeville 545 is now being repeated at Vierzon where there is a strike on.
619 Vaillant, whose home it is, is taking a leading part there.
In Paris, the Radicals 429 are working for us, as is Bismarck in Germany.
They have got themselves into a frightful mess over the bucket-shops, and Clemenceau, though he had no need to do so, has nevertheless become too deeply involved with that crew to be able to keep out of it altogether.
Thus the rift between him and the erstwhile radical working men yawns ever wider, and his loss is our gain.
Our people are behaving with great address and I am sur­ prised at the amount of discipline shown by the French.
It was just what they lacked, and now they are acquiring it, but against a back­ ground of a wholly revolutionary tradition which, in France, is taken for granted and is innocent of all those philistine misgivings which are the bane of our Geisers and Vierecks.
Next time, even with the scrutin de liste, 375 we shall score considerable successes in France.
And it is precisely because everything's going so marvellously, both there and in Germany, and because a couple of years of uninterrupted internal development, helped along by the events inevitable in the circum­ stances, would contribute so enormously to our progress — it is pre­ cisely because of all diis that I wouldn't exactiy wish for a world war— but history recks little of that! It pursues its course and we have to take it as it comes.
There's one thing you people should learn from the French.
For 50 years all revolutionaries there have subscribed to the rule that the ac­ cused should refuse to give the examining magistrate any information whatsoever.
The latter has the right to ask, the accused has the right not to answer, not to incriminate himself and his comrades.
This — once it has been generally accepted to the extent that any deviation from it ranks as quasi betrayal — is of enormous advantage in all trials.
One is still free to say what one likes at the public proceedings.

For weeks I have been kept so busy with the proofs (in triplicate) of the translation of Capital, * that I have been unable to do anything else, and now they are coming thick and fast.
Allegedly I am to get 6 sheets a week (i.
e.
18 sheets a week to be corrected), and the whole thing is supposed to be finished in 4 weeks' time.
We shall see.
But I'm going to have a lively time of it since, apart from anything else, old Becker b is arriving tomorrow from Geneva to stay with me, the fol­ lowing week I shall have Schorlemmer and probably the Lafargues, not to mention other people from Switzerland who are proposing to come over here.
So I know that, if I don't get a letter written today, there'll be no chance of doing so later on.
Many thanks for the trouble you have gone to over the interview­ er.

-Johann Philipp Becker-1 John T.
McEnnis tage to impose upon some liar of this ilk.
You are right in saying that I haven't, on the whole, any cause for complaint; the man does at least try to be decent from the personal point of view, and not he, but the American bourgeoisie, is to blame for his stupidity.
59a A fine crew they'd seem to be at the head of the party in New York 5 4 9 and as for the Sozialist, it's a model of what a paper ought not to be.
But nor can I congratulate Dietzgen on his article re anar­ chists 626; it's an odd way he has of going about things.
If, for in­ stance, a person takes a somewhat narrow-minded view of a particu­ lar point, Dietzgen is at pains — often undue pains — to stress that there are two sides to every question.
But now, because of the New Yorkers' abject behaviour, he suddenly takes the other side and tries to make us all out to be anarchists.
This may be excusable as things are now, but even at a crucial juncture he should not, after all, en­ tirely forget his dialectics.
However, he has probably long since worked all this out of his system and is certainly back on the right track again, so there's no cause for alarm.
In a country as unsophisticated as America which, though wholly without a feudal past, has evolved along purely bourgeois lines yet has uncritically taken over from England a mass of ideology deriving from feudal times, such as English common law, religion, sectarian­ ism, and where the exigencies of practical work and of the concen­ tration of capital have engendered a general contempt, only now di­ minishing amongst the most highly educated and learned circles, for all theory — in such a country, the people will have to find out what their own social interests are by making one blunder after another.
Nor will the workers be spared this experience; the confusion of the TRADES UNIONS, the socialists, the KNIGHTS OF LABOR, 6°9 etc.
, will persist for some time yet, until wisdom is born of their own misfortunes.
But the main thing is that they are now in motion, that they are actually progressing, and that the spell has been broken; things will move fast, faster than anywhere else, even though the course they take may seem erratic and, from the theoretical standpoint, almost demented.
Your letter arrived too late for me to speak to Aveling about Brooks 627 — I only saw him, Aveling, for a couple of hours on 30 Au­ gust, and I had left your letter behind in Eastbourne.

It's not possible to subscribe to them direct.
I shall send you some French papers when I myself get any from Paris.
A few went off from Eastbourne.

I myself get it very irregularly and often have to write, but I have to keep it for REFERENCE.
I am also sending you some surplus proof-sheets of the Capital translation so that you can see how the thing's progressing and what it looks like.
I hope your health is improving; I seem robust enough, but for 3 years now my mobility has been restricted, sometimes very con­ siderably and always to a certain extent by an internal ailment, so that I am, alas, no longer fit for active service.
The first thing I shall have to do, as soon as the translation is fi­ nished, is rid myself of the minor jobs that have been foisted on me — revising other people's work, notably translations — and avoid get­ ting myself saddled with any more, so that I can return to the 3rd vol­ ume.
b The whole thing's there, ready dictated, but there's still a good 6 months' hard slogging to be done.
This confounded English transla­ tion has taken up the better part of a year.
But it was absolutely essen­ tial and I don't regret it.
17 September The proof-sheets went off yesterday and the Commonweals up to 18 September will follow today.
I have got to look out the copies of To-Day.
The movement over here is still in the hands, on the one side of ad­ venturers (DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION 300) and, on the other, of hobby­ horse riders and sentimental socialists (SOCIALIST LEAGUE 346); the masses are still holding aloof, although here too beginnings of a move­ ment are perceptible.
But it will be some time before the masses are in full spate, which is a good thing because it means that there will be time for proper leaders to emerge.
a Overseas subscription -b of Capital In Germany, some kind of movement will, presumably, at last come into being again among the bourgeoisie, whose cowardly inertia is becoming harmful to us; on the one hand the now imminent change of monarcha will induce a general state of instability, on the other Bismarck's kow-towing to the Tsarb is arousing even the most lethargic from their slumbers.
625 In France things are going fa­ mously.
Our people are learning discipline, in the provinces from the STRIKES, in Paris from their opposition to the Radicals.

In the meantime I have a bit of agreeable news for you.
Meissner sends this morning account for last seasons sales, and the result is a profit of 2,600 marks or about £130 for us, after deducting all expenses of the second vol­ ume a; so your share will be above £40-.

The thing is proceeding, but rather slowly.

It is lucky for them that the first attempt at intimidation came so soon and was so clumsily executed.
I am afraid Paul exaggerates the significance of the Paris verdict in so far as it is a symptom of the accessibility of the industrial bourgeoi­ sie for socialist ideas.
630 The struggle between usurer and industrial capitalist is one within the bourgeoisie itself, and though no doubt a certain number of petty bourgeois will be driven over to us by the cer­ tainty of their impending expropriation de la part des boursiers, a yet we can never hope to get the mass of them over to our side.
Moreover this is not desirable, as they bring their narrow class prejudices along with them.
In Germany we have too many of them, and it is they who form the dead weight which trammels the march of the party.
It will ever be the lot of the petty bourgeois — as a mass — to float undecid­ edly between the two great classes, one part to be crushed by the centralisation of capital, the other by the victory of the proletariat.
On the decisive day, they will as usual be tottering, wavering and helpless, se laisseront faire, b and that is all we want.
Even if they come round to our views they will say: of course communism is the ultimate solution, but it is far off, maybe 100 years before it can be realised — in other words: we do not mean to work for its realisation neither in our, nor in our children's lifetime.
Such is our experience in Ger­ many.
Otherwise the verdict is a grand victory and marks a decided step in advance.
The bourgeoisie, from the moment it is faced by a con­ scious and organised proletariat, becomes entangled in hopeless con­ tradictions between its liberal and democratic general tendencies here, and the repressive necessities of its defensive struggle against the pro­ letariat there.
A cowardly bourgeoisie, like the German and Russian, sacrifices its general class tendencies to the momentary advantages of brutal repression.
But a bourgeoisie with a revolutionary history of its own, such as the English and particularly the French, cannot do that so easily.
Hence that struggle within the bourgeoisie itself, which in spite of occasional fits of violence and oppression, on the whole drives it forward — see the various electoral reforms of Gladstone in England,299 and the advance of Radicalism in France.
429 This verdict is a new étape.
And so the bourgeoisie, in doing its own work, is doing ours.

I, Paris, 1956 291 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL 6 » [IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN] London, 8 October 1886 Dear Bebel, I am writing to you today because of the conversations I have had with old Johann Philipp Becker who spent 10 days with me here and is now doubtless back in Geneva, having returned via Paris (where he discovered that his daughter had died suddenly).
628 It was a great pleasure to see the old colossus again; though he has aged physically, he's still as merry and pugnacious as ever.
He is one of the characters out of our Rheno-Franconian saga that are personified in the Nibe­ lungenlied — Volker the Fiddler to the life.
I had been asking him for years to set down his reminiscences and experiences" and he told me that, having also been encouraged by you and others, he himself felt very much inclined to do so and had actually made a start on several occasions, though he had met with little real encouragement when his work was published piecemeal (as in the Neue Welt to which he sent some quite splendid stuff b years ago, which was, however, considered insufficiently 'novelistic' as Liebknecht informed him via Motteler).
A more formidable obstacle, however, was the need to work for his keep and earn 25 frs per week a See this volume, p.
363.

as correspondent to a Viennese paper.
6 3 ' For that he has to read a vast number of papers and periodicals and, since he has suffered from weak eyesight ever since the explosion during his experiment in Paris,632 this alone is more than he can cope with.
I have now promised him that for a start I shall write to you and Ede.
I feel that in so far as its resources permit — as they now do, ac­ cording to what I have been told by Liebknecht and have heard from Zurich — the party is under an obligation to admit this old veteran, at least partially, to its pension fund, and not to allow him to ruin his eyes for the sake of 25 frs per week.
At present Becker gets 25 frs a month from van Kol, a similar amount from a friend in Basle, while I myself have undertaken to pay him £5 = 125 frs a quarter, making 1,100 frs a year in all.
I may have made a mistake about the amounts paid by the other two; it may only be 20 frs, in which case the total would come to 980 frs.
The balance to be made up by the party would therefore be of no great significance and could doubtless be raised without difficulty by private subscription, so that in the case of payments the party treasury would simply act as intermediary.
As to what the balance should amount to, this would be best determined by Ede with the help of the old man himself.
If this can be arranged, he would have time to write and/or dictate his memoirs which, since they are of the utmost importance as re­ gards the history of the revolutionary movement in Germany, i.
e.
our party's antecedents, and to some extent the actual history of the party since 1860, would make an extremely valuable and saleable addition to the Volksbuchhandlung'sa list.
I consider this work highly neces­ sary, for otherwise a whole mass of the most valuable material will go down with old Becker to the grave, or at best these things will be pre­ served and presented exclusively by those wholly or partially op­ posed to us, vulgar democrats, etc.
Besides, the old man played quite an important political and military role.
During the 1849 campaign he was the only commander who was a genuine product of the people and he achieved more with the crude, homespun strategy and tactics taught him by the Swiss army than any of the officers from Baden or Prussia, while at the same time he never deviated from the correct po­ litical course.
Moreover he was a natural commander of a people's army, had remarkable presence of mind and was possessed of rare skill in the handling of young troops.
a a Social Democratic bookshop in Zurich It was in fact my intention to write to Ede first about the bookselling aspect of the matter, because there would have been much I could have discussed in a more positive vein after receiving his reply, but that damned Freiberg verdict602 may put paid to my plans at any moment and that is why I am approaching you straight away.
If you take a favourable view of the matter, perhaps you would tell me whom I should deal with while you are in retreat, so that I can pursue this further — the old chap is somewhat mistrustful of Lieb­ knecht, nor do I feel he is the right man, though I shall discuss it with him on his return; but the very fact of his being absent means that someone else will now have to deal with the business.
I must now close if this letter is to go off.
I shan't forgive the court for depriving me of your visit and you of your trip to Paris.
But could you, perhaps, come over here next summer before the elections and accompany me on a visit to the seaside so as to build up your strength for the campaign? Will it be more or less possible to contact you while you're in prison? Liebknecht and the Avelings have been given a fairly, indeed un­ expectedly, decent reception by the Anglo-American press.

, Published in English in full for the first time 292 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN IN ZURICH London, 9 October 1886 Dear Ede, Having perused with some perplexity your 3 pages of painstaking argument633—perplexity as to what you could actually be driving at — I couldn't help laughing out loud when I finally got to the nub of the matter and realised that all this was intended to explain your marriage which, after all, calls for no explanation whatsoever.
If all proletarians were to be so hesitant, either the proletariat would be­ come extinct or it would reproduce itself only through illegitimate children, a method we are unlikely to resort to en masse until the prole­ tariat has ceased to be.
So please accept my heartiest congratulations on having at last overcome your grave hesitations and given free rein to the promptings of your heart.
You will find that living as a couple, even when times are bad, is better than living alone; I myself put it to the test long enough, sometimes under the most wretched condi­ tions, and never had cause to rue it.
So give your fiancée a my kindest regards and jump into thalamus h with a will.
But it is already four o'clock and my letter must go off before 5.
30, so now to business.
Old Becker has been here628 and there was much talk about the necessity of his recording his reminiscences and experiences.
It is something I and, he says, others as well, had often proposed to him, but how is he to do it? In order to live, he contributes to Schneeber-ger's Korrespondenz in Vienna 631 in return for 25 frs a week, and for this he must laboriously collect material.
The toll on his strength and eyesight is such that he is able to do nothing else.
632 It is therefore es­ sential that he be put in a position which will enable him to live while devoting all his time to the thing.
Now van Kol, if I remember aright, gives him 25 frs a month and another friend the same amount.
That makes 600 frs a year.
I have undertaken to send him £5 = 125 frs a quarter.
Total 1,100 frs.
In my view, it is up to the party to supply the remainder, provided it has the means which, according to what Liebknecht told me, it does have.
In fact, it ought really to provide wholly for the old veteran out of its pension fund.
But I don't suppose there would be much difficulty about raising from well-to-do party comrades the few hundred francs still required, and this would mean that the party would merely act as intermediary for the regular pay­ ments.
The memoirs as such would be a highly valuable addition to the Volksbuchhandlung'sc list, a new source on our party's antecedents (the revolutionary movement from 1827 to 1860) and its history a Regina Schattner -b nuptial bed-0 a Social Democratic bookshop in Zurich (from the '50s up till the present), a document that no real historiog­ rapher could afford to overlook.
And, what's more, a magnificently vivid account — genuine popular literature, if the samples published years ago in the Neue Welt are anything to go by.
a And the sooner he gets down to it the better, for when a chap has already totted up a total of 77 years, his verbosity tends to outstrip his ability to assess what is important and what is not — such is the course of nature.
I wrote to Augustb about this yesterday; I had meant to write to you first and find out what you people at the publishing end thought about it, but since he is shortly due to go into jug,602 there was no time to waste.
I myself consider the thing to be of the utmost impor­ tance.
An account of what happened by an active participant,— indeed the only survivor from the thirties whose standpoint is the same as our own — is an absolute necessity; it will cast a new light on the whole of the period between 1827 and 1840 and, unless done by Becker, will be lost forever.
Or else it will be undertaken by people who are hostile to us — members of the People's Party 203 and other vulgar democrats, and that would serve no good purpose.
It is an opportunity such as will never again present itself and to miss it would, I believe, be a crime.
I told August it would be best — once matters have got to that stage — if the details regarding the balance to be paid and the mode of publication were to be arranged personally between yourself and Becker.
And in this connection there's another point which I thought it unnecessary to raise with August at this juncture, namely that the balance should be regarded simply as a pension and not as an advance on the fee.
This last might be suggested by some of the 'leaders' but would be an exceedingly shabby way to treat the old warrior.
Hence my proposal that as much of the balance as possible be raised by private subscription, when any such suggestion would be automatically precluded.
If all this should be settled and you enter into negotiations with Becker re publication, you should take no notice of his ideas about sales, etc.
, prospectus, and so forth.
So far as his ideas about the sale of banned books are concerned, he might still be living in the '40s, a J.

and he has no inkling of the way this has now changed into a big in­ dustry.
So consider the matter and let me know what you think.
So far the Bulgarians have indeed done unexpectedly well and, if they hold out another 8 or 10 days, either they will win through or, should the Russians march against them, it will be only at the risk of a European war.
634 This they owe to the circumstances of having been so long subject to the Turks, who were content to preserve what remained of their gentile institutions, while only preventing— through the depredations of the pashas — the rise of the middle classes.
The Serbs, on the other hand, who had been free of the Turks for 80 years, wrecked their old gentile institutions by introducing Austrian legislation and an Austrian-trained bureaucracy, hence their inevitable drubbing at the hands of the Bulgarians.
Give the Bulgarians 60 years of bourgeois evolution — when they would certainly accomplish nothing — and of bureaucratic rule, and they would go to wrack and ruin just as the Serbs have done.
It would have been infinitely better for the Bulgarians as for us had they remained Turkish until the European revolution; their gentile institutions would have provided a first-rate point of departure for their further evolution along communist lines, just as would the Russian mir, a which is now likewise being destroyed under our very noses.
As things are now I take the view that: 1) The southern Slavs should be supported if, and for as long as, they oppose Russia, for then they will go along with the European re­ volutionary movement.
2) If, however, they oppose the Turks, i.
e.
demand the annexation à tout prix b of the few Turkish Serbs and Bulgarians that still remain, then they will, consciously or unconsciously, be doing Russia's work for it, and we cannot go along with them.
This could only be achieved at the risk of a European war, and isn't worth the candle.
The chaps will have to wait, just like the Alsatians and the Lorrainers, the Trentini, etc.
Moreover, the result of any renewed attack on the Turks could — in present circumstances — only be that the victorious small nationalities — victorious solely thanks to Russia — would come directly under the Russian yoke, or — cf.
the linguistic map of the peninsula — become hopelessly embroiled with one another.
3) As soon as revolution breaks out in Russia, however, the chaps a village commune-11 whatever the cost can do as they like.
But then, too, they will realise that they are no match for the Turks.
Time for the post.

<-Published in Lnghsh tor the hrst time 293 ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN IN ZURICH London, 22 October 1886 Dear Ede, This is to inform you that our friend Belfort Bax will probably be visiting you towards the end of this month.
He is a thoroughly good sort, very erudite, especially in German philosophy, and speaks Ger­ man, though in all political matters he's of a childlike innocence that can drive one to despair and is also much in evidence in The Common­ weal.
But among the 'eddicated' here he and Aveling are the only ones who not only are in earnest where the cause is concerned, but also devote some study to it.
Kautsky will have informed you about the legal niceties involved in getting married over here; I hope it can be arranged.
As regards Becker,3 August writes635 to say he has asked you to clarify matters with the old man.
I trust you have already written to him — the old man—, as it is something he has very much at heart.
August says that Becker is already getting an annual allowance of 200 frs from the party — I know I had omitted one item from the amounts I had stated b; this was it.
I merely raise the point lest the impression a Johann Philipp Becker-1" See this volume, p.
501.
should have been given that Becker had concealed it from me, which was not the case.
If the stories put about by the Zankovists in Sofia are true636 Alexander III can safely recall his discredited Kaulbars,634 for he will then have everything he wants.
It will be an improved version of the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi 637 (1839, see Louis Blanc, Dix ans," where it is set out in the last volume).
The Black Sea will then belong to him and Constantinople will be his for the asking.
This would be the result of the appropriation of parts of Turkey, namely Bosnia and Egypt, by Austria and Britain respectively, who thus revealed themselves in Constantinople as Russia's equals when it came to plun­ dering Turkey.
That was why the peace-loving Gladstone had to bombard Alexandria and wage war in the Sudan.
638—However the story is being contested and it is probable that no formal agreement has yet been concluded; but at all events we must watch out for further news of the affair.
For even ^it were true, Austria in particular would try to hush it up lest it be compelled to attack before the Russians really showed signs of occupying the Dardanelles, i.
e.
when it was too late.
Meanwhile Alexander seems to have gone really insane — he is said to have taken one of his aides-de-camp for a Nihilist356 and shot him—, while old William b is going rapidly downhill.
The Russian revolution — be it ushered in by a palace revolution — is becoming more necessary than ever and would at once help to clear up the whole wretched business.

-b William I 294 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 23 October 1886 My dear Laura, To-day I have a bit of a holiday that is to say no proof-sheets,a and the prefaces are as good as done.
So I profit of it to write to you.
Proofs are now up to sheet 40, or p.
644 of German 3rd edition.
But there is a hitch again, otherwise I should be busy to-day at them again.
It's awful work, every sheet 3 proofs, and a good many altera­ tions to make in the text; the latter part of the manuscript was any­ thing but ausgefeilt, b when we had to cede to pressure and hand it in to the printer.
Sam Moore, in the polishing of the text, is invaluable to me, he has a capital eye for these things and a very ready hand.
But I shall be glad when it's done, as it is I cannot take anything else in hand and there are about 5 jobs awaiting in my desk.
I certainly do hope that you will not again put off your journey till some other time which may be less foggy meteorologically but which after all would leave us both in a fog of fresh uncertainty.
As to Schor-lemmer he arrived here quite knocked up, had been laid up at home for a week with indigestion (it was the Vaterland I suppose he could not digest) and was in an awfully down-in-the-mouth mood here all the time — since then I have not heard a word from him.
I send you herewith two more letters from our transatlantic travel­ lers, c please keep the lot for me until you come over, unless you re­ turn them before.
They were yesterday in Providence (Rhode Island) and are now on the road from New England to the Great Lakes, stop­ ping half way to-morrow at Albany and Troy (New York State) on die Hudson.
601 The press in die New England manufacturing districts has been almost cordial in its reception, thus showing not only its own dependence upon the working people, but also an evident sym­ pathetic feeling towards socialism on the part of the latter.
I am very glad of this and also of the favourable effect they have made on the bourgeois press generally, more particularly on account of their im-a of the English translation of the first volume of Capital (see Note 56) -b polished -c Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling pending arrival in Chicago where the bourgeois, six weeks ago, seemed inclined to get up police rows on their arrival.
But they will hardly attempt anything of the kind in the face of the decided change in public opinion down East.
The Vienna anarchist plot is a pure police affair.
639 The best proof is in the self-inflaming bottles the poor fools were told to put in timber yards to set them on fire.
A bottle with nitric acid, stopped with cot­ ton impregnated with sulphuric acid.
This latter was to percolate and on reaching the nitric acid, was expected to cause an explosion and fire!! Thus the same police which excited the anarchist jackasses to this plot, took damned good care that the fire bottles were perfectly harmless.
But the present anti-proletarian jurisprudence will there as everywhere find means to convict them of arson.
Yesterday I had a card from an unknown place in Canada 'Rolan-drie, P.
O.
Whitewood': 'Verehelicht*: Dr R.
Meyer, Mathilda Meyer, geb.
b Trautow.
' This must be a cousin of his whom he left on his farm last winter to mind it.
On the back a few words in French from a Comte Ives de Rossignac or Prossignac that Meyer has had an accident and cannot use his right hand for a short time, and therefore cannot write himself.
That is the end of another of your adorers.
The grapes being sour, people take to crab-apples.
The successful issue of the Lyons Congress I read in the Cri, c but nevertheless Paul's comments and details were very welcome to me.
640 Things seem everywhere ripe for us and we have only to gather in the fruit; all old-fashioned forms of socialism are exploded while nothing can touch our theory, and so the working people need only stirring up — whenever they get into movement, no matter how, they are sure to come round to us.
Altogether things are going on bravely in France.
Vierzon 6 '9 con­ tinues Decazeville,545 and rightly so.
The government must be taught to respect their own laws and to get used to strikes.
And on the other hand the discipline of a strike is most useful to the French work­ ing men; a movement in which strict legality is the first condition of success, and where all revolutionary brag and explosion necessarily brings on defeat.
This discipline is the first condition of successful and lasting organisation, and the thing most feared by the bourgeoisie.
And as it has brought on one ministerial crisis,641 it may bring on more.
As matters stand, it looks as if the present Chamber would soon a married -b née -c Cri du Peuple become impossible and have to be dissolved.
I believe it will be very necessary to prepare for that event, for in" the next general election the Socialists ought to force the Radicals 429 to place at least 20 of our people on the list for Paris; and the next Chamber ought to abolish scrutin de liste.
3 7 5 Paul ought to get into Parliament next time, he has effaced himself a good deal in favour of Guesde, Deville and others, taken the hard anonymous work upon himself and left to the others not only all the pay but also the greater part of the credit.
I think the time is approaching when he ought to assert himself a little more.
He is decidedly the best writer amongst the lot — now that he has once found his happy vein and sticks to it — and also the most studious.
And he is far more than all the rest in constant touch with the in­ ternational movement.
He and Guesde at the very least ought to get in next time and shape for it from now.
Guesde may be more flashy as an orator but Paul would be far better in bringing out facts.
However by next spring we may have a European war which up­ sets all our calculations being incalculable in its results.
About that I shall write Paula as soon as I find time.
Now I must conclude, hav­ ing just time enough left to send a few words to Tussy by to-day's mail.
Nim is very jolly and sends her love.

23 and 25 October 1886 509 295 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL [IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN] London, 23 and 25 October 1886, Saturday Dear Bebel, The Sozialdemokrat containing your statement 642 arrived just now, at 9.
30 p.
m.
, and I am hastening to write to you although my letter cannot go off until 5.
30 on Monday, when I shall have it regis­ tered.
But on Monday, I may again have a whole lot of proofs3 re­ quiring my immediate attention.
Your statement is so worded that no exception whatever can be taken to it — assuming the necessity of such a step.
As to this, I cannot rightly judge but, even in the absence of Freytag's opinion, it would seem to me justified.
From the viewpoint both of the cause in general and of the newspaper in particular, it was, to my mind, most fortun­ ate that the verdict enabled you to take this step in a seemly way.
To have conferred an official character on the paper in the first place was, in my view, a great mistake, and so, indeed, it has proved to be in the Reichstag and elsewhere; but once it had been done, you could hardly go back on it without appearing to disown the paper and beat a retreat.
The verdict gave you an opportunity of going back on it without producing that impression and you did right in making use of it.
Nor, as Liebknecht saw it, was there any question of beating a re­ treat, and the paper will now be able to express the views of the great bulk of the party far more freely and with far less regard for the gen­ tlemen of the right wing.
The Neue £eit has not yet arrived.
643 I too take the view that Bismarck has got far more involved with the Russians than he need have done on France's account, and for this the main reason — besides those adduced by you, and overshadowing them all — is his having been told by the Russians what he knows to be true, namely: 'Either we must have decisive and resounding victories on the road to Constantinople, or else — we shall have révolution.
' Without making sac­ rifices, neither Alexander III nor yet the Russian diplomats can exor-" of the English translation of the first volume of Capital (see Note 56) eise the Pan-Slav and chauvinist spirit they have conjured up, for oth­ erwise Alexander III will be bumped off by the generals and then, whether they like it or not, they'll get a national assembly.
And a Russian revolution is what Bismarck fears above all else.
The col­ lapse of Russian tsarism would entail that of the Prusso-Bismarckian economy.
And hence everything possible must be done to postpone the crash, despite Austria, despite the indignation of the middle classes in Germany, and despite Bismarck's knowledge that, either way, he will eventually undermine his system — which, after all, de­ pends on German hegemony in Europe — and that, on the day old William a dies, both Russia and France will rattle their sabres in quite different fashion.
The worst of it is that, given the rascality of those in power, no one can say how, in case of war, the belligerents will assort themselves, who will side with, and who against whom.
That the eventual outcome will be revolution is plain, but at the cost of what sacrifices, of what general prostration — and after who knows how many changes.
In the meanwhile there'll be a respite until the spring, and during that time much can happen.
In Russia the fun might begin without more ado, old William might kick the bucket and Germany change its policy, the Turks (having been deprived of Bosnia by Austria and of Egypt by Britain, they will, of course, now regard these their former allies merely as traitors) may again get out of the Russian fur­ row, etc.
Your opinion of the German bourgeoisie cannot be worse than mine.
But it remains to be seen whether historical circumstances won't compel them actively to intervene willy-nilly, just like their French counterparts.
The latter's performance is wretched enough and that of our lot would be even worse, but all the same they'd be forced to take a hand in their own history again.
At the time, I read Berger's pronouncement with some pleasure, but as you say it's ap­ plicable only to Bismarck's lifetime.
That it's their intention to drop their own 'liberal' slogans for good, I do not for a moment doubt.
644 It remains to be seen whether they can do so once they no longer have a Bismarck to rule for them and find themselves face to face with nothing but imbecile squireens and dim-witted bureaucrats — people of their own moral calibre.
For come war or peace, Germany's he­ gemony has, during the past few months, gone for a burton and she has a William I again become the humble servant of Russia.
And it was only the chauvinist satisfaction of being the arbiter of Europe that held the whole bag of tricks together.
Fear of the proletariat will certainly help things along.
And if these chaps gain admittance to the government, they will certainly start off by adopting the very attitude you de­ scribe, but will soon be forced to change their tune.
I would go still further and say that even were the spell to be broken by the Old Man's death and the same people to remain at the helm as now, they would either be forced to resign as a result of renewed clashes — not only with the Court — or have to act in accordance with bourgeois views.
Not at once, of course, but very soon.
Political stagnation such as now obtains in Germany — a genuine Second Empire — can only be a transitory and exceptional state of affairs; large-scale industry will not allow its laws to be dictated by the cowardice of industrialists.
Economic development will give rise to repeated clashes, each more severe than the last, nor will it suffer itself to be governed for any length of time by semi-feudal Junkers with feudal procliv­ ities.
Come to that, there is also the possibility that in the spring they will all gird up their loins for war and, armed to the teeth, con­ front one another, each fearing to begin, until one of them puts for­ ward a solution involving mutual compromise and the swallowing up of small states, whereupon they'll all grab their share.
That Bis­ marck is presently adumbrating such an expedient seems probable enough.
25 October Your remarks about Liebknecht's speeches presumably relate mainly to what he told the correspondent of the New Yorker Volhszeit-ung (little Cuno); this shouldn't be taken too literally — since inter­ viewers always distort things.
I agree that his other remarks about the Kulturkampf i&2 are somewhat misguided, but as you know, Liebknecht is very dependent on atmosphere and tends to chan­ ce his hand with his audiences (not always successfully), while he ne­ ver has more than two colours — black and white — on his palette.
Not that very much harm will have been done, since it will all have been long since forgotten in America.
Goodbye, then, and mind you keep fit and send us occasional news of yourself during your imprisonment.
602 I hardly imagine that you will have to stay there for the full term, and in 9 months' time every­ thing may have changed.

In the winter of 1878 b Disraeli sent 4 ironclads into the Bosphorus, this being sufficient to halt the Russian advance on Constantinople and to tear up the Treaty of San Stefano.
6 4 6 For a time the Treaty of Berlin stabilised the situation in the Orient.
Bismarck succeeded in ef­ fecting a settlement between the Russians and the Austrians, in ac­ cordance with which Austria was tacitly given dominion over Serbia, while Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia were to be left exposed to the predominant influence of Russia.
In other words, if the Russians were later permitted to take Constantinople, Austria would get Salonika and Macedonia.
But on top of that, Bosnia was allotted to Austria, just as the great­ er part of Poland proper had been handed over to the Prussians and Austrians by Russia in 1794, only to be taken back by the latter in 1814.
647 Bosnia represented a constant drain on Austria, a bone of a Cri du Peuple -b 1879 in the original contention between Hungary and Western Austria and, in particu­ lar—proof, where Turkey was concerned, that the fate awaiting it at the hands of Austria no less than at those of Russia, would be that suffered by Poland.
Henceforward there could be no question of mutual trust between Turkey and Austria — a tremendous victory, this, for Russia.
Though Serbia's sympathies were Slavophil and, consequently, Russophil it had, since its emancipation, looked to Austria for all its means of bourgeois development.
Its young men went to university in Austria, its bureaucratic system, its statute books, its judicial pro­ cedure and its schools all conformed to the Austrian model, as was only natural.
But Russia thought it necessary to prevent the same thing happening in Bulgaria and, besides, had no desire to act as Austria's cat's paw there.
Thus, from the very outset, Bulgaria was organised along the lines of a Russian satrapy.
The administration was Russian, as were the officers and non-commissioned officers in the ar­ my, the whole body of government officials and, indeed, the entire system, while Battenberg, imposed upon it as satrap, was a cousin of Alexander Ill's.
Russian domination, direct at first, then indirect, succeeded in stif­ ling, within less than 4 years, all the sympathy Bulgaria had once felt for Russia, whole-hearted and enthusiastic though that sympathy had been.
The people increasingly jibbed at the insolence of their 'li­ berators', so that even Battenberg, a man of weak character and de­ void of political ideas, who asked nothing better than to serve the Tsar on condition that he himself was accorded some measure of re­ spect— even Battenberg was becoming increasingly rebellious.
In the meantime things were taking their course in Russia.
The government had succeeded, by draconian measures, in temporarily dispersing and disorganising the Nihilists.
356 But this could not last forever; what was needed was to gain the support of public opinion and to distract people's minds from social and political miseries at home — in other words, a bit of chauvinist phantasmagoria.
And just as, under Louis Napoleon, the left bank of the Rhine had served to divert revolutionary fervour to foreign policy matters, so, too, in Russia the image of a Constantinople subdued, of oppressed Turkish Slavs 'libe­ rated' to form part of a great federation under Russian leadership, was conjured up before the eyes of the anxious and restive people.
But merely to evoke that phantasmagoria was not enough; something would have to be done to make it enter the domain of reality.
Circumstances were favourable.
The annexation of Alsace-Lorraine had thrown an apple of discord between France and Ger­ many so that those two powers appeared to cancel each other out.
Austria on her own was scarcely in a position to fight Russia, since her most effective offensive weapon — an appeal to the Poles — must, thanks to Prussia, remain permanently in the scabbard.
And the oc­ cupation— or theft — of Bosnia constituted another Alsace between Austria and Turkey.
Italy fell to the highest bidder, that is to say Russia, whose stake was the Trentino and Istria, if not also Dalmatia and Tripoli.
And England? Gladstone, that peaceable Russophil, had hearkened to Russia's siren call and had occupied Egypt in time of peace,648 thus ensuring not only continual discord between En­ gland and France, but also and into the bargain the impossibility of any alliance between the Turks and the English who had just despoiled them by appropriating Egypt, a Turkish fief.
Moreover, Russia's prepara­ tions in Asia were sufficiently advanced to keep the English, in case of war, fully occupied in India.
Never had the moment presented so many and such favourable opportunities to the Russians; their diplomacy was proving victorious all.
along the line.
The revolt of the Bulgarians against Russian domination provided the pretext for instituting a campaign.
In the summer of 1885 a carrot was dangled before the Bulgarians of North and South — the possibil­ ity of unification, as pledged by the Peace of San Stefano and revoked by the Treaty of Berlin.
They were told that, if they again entrusted themselves to the liberating arms of Russia, that country would ac­ complish her mission by accomplishing the said unification, but the Bulgarians, for their part, must first rid themselves of Battenberg.
Duly forewarned, the latter reacted with unwonted promptitude and vigour.
Off his own bat and on his own account he effected the unifi­ cation which the Russians had intended to bring about in his despite.
From that moment it was implacable war between him and Russia.
To begin with, that war was conducted covertly and by indirect means.
The small Balkan states were reminded of Louis Bonaparte's splendid doctrine which held that, when a nation hitherto disunit­ ed— say Italy or Germany—constituted itself a nation, other pow­ ers— say France — were entitled to territorial compensation.
Serbia swallowed the bait and went to war with Bulgaria.
Russia's tri­ umph was the greater in that the war, instigated by her in her own interests, appeared to the rest of the world to be taking place under the auspices of Austria, which had failed to prevent it for fear this should bring the Russian party to power in Serbia.
— Russia, for her part, disrupted the Bulgarian army by recalling all its senior officers, including battalion commanders.
But contrary to all expectations the Bulgarians, deprived of Rus­ sian officers and with two men to the enemy's three, inflicted a re­ sounding defeat on the Serbs and won the respect and admiration of an astonished Europe.
478 For those victories there were two reasons.
In the first place Alexander Battenberg, though a weak politician, was a good soldier who waged war as he had learned to do in the Prussian school, whereas the Serbs, in both strategy and tactics, turned to Austria for their model.
Secondly, the Serbs had lived for 60 years under a bureaucratic Austrian regime which, while failing to give them a strong middle class and an independent peasantry (by now all their property was mortgaged), had succeeded in undermin­ ing and disorganising what remained of the gentile communism which had lent them strength in their struggles against the Turks.
In Bulgaria, on the other hand, these more or less communist institu­ tions had been left intact by the Turks, and this is the explanation for their superior courage.
So Russia was foiled again and had to make a fresh start.
And the Slavophil chauvinism which had been encouraged in the hope that it would counterbalance the revolutionary element, continued to grow day by day and had already begun to pose a threat to the govern­ ment.
So the Tsar betook himself to the Crimea3 where, or so the Russian press maintained, he would achieve great things.
He attempt­ ed to entice the Sultan b there so as to involve him in an alliance by demonstrating that his erstwhile allies — Austria and England — were traitors and robbers and that France was in tow to, and at the mercy of, Russia.
But the Sultan did not come and, for the time be­ ing, there was no employment for the vast armaments Russia had ac­ cumulated in the west and the south.
The Tsar returned (last June) from the Crimea,0 but in the mean­ time the tide of chauvinism had continued to rise and the govern­ ment, far from controlling this upward surge, found itself increasingly carried away by it.
So much so that, on the Tsar's return to Moscow, there was no preventing the mayor,d in his address,e of speaking loud " on 1 April 1886 -b Abdul-Hamid II -' Alexander III returned to Gatchina (near St Petersburg) on 30 May 1886 (see flpaeumeÄbcmeeHHuü etcmnuKb, No.

and clear about the conquest of Constantinople.
649 Under the influ­ ence of the generals, and under their aegis, the press openly expressed the expectation that the Tsar would take action against Austria and Ger­ many which were hampering him, nor did the government have the courage to muzzle it.
In short, Slavophil chauvinism was stronger than the Tsar.
Either the latter must give way or else — the Slavo­ phils would rebel.
All this was compounded by a shortage of cash.
No one was willing to lend money to a government which between 1870 and 1875 had borrowed 70 million pounds sterling (1,750 million frs) in London and was posing a threat to the peace of Europe.
Only three years be­ fore, in Germany, Bismarck had raised a loan of 375 million frs on its behalf, but that had been frittered away long since; and without Bismarck's signature the Germans wouldn't give another farthing.
But that signature was no longer to be had save at the cost of humiliating conditions.
At home, the government paper-mill had already been producing to excess; the rouble in silver was worth 3 fr.
80, but in pa­ per-money only 2 fr.
20.
And armaments were diabolically expensive.
Finally action became imperative.
Either a successful move against Constantinople, or revolution.
Which is why Giers went to call on Bismarck to explain the situation to him.
And Bismarck understood him perfectly.
He would have restrained the Russians, first because of their insatiability and secondly out of consideration for Austria.
But revolution in Russia might involve the fall of Bismarck's régime in Ger­ many.
Without the large reserves of the reactionary army, the rule of the cabbage Junkers in Prussia would not last a day.
Revolution in Russia would, at a stroke, change the situation in Germany; it would put an end to that blind faith in Bismarck's omnipotence which had rallied to his standard all the propertied classes; it would foment revo­ lution in Germany.
Bismarck, who had no illusions but that the existence of tsarism in Russia was the base upon which the whole of his system rested, understood very well; he hastened to Vienna to tell his Austrian friends that, in the face of such a danger, it would not be opportune either for him or for them to place undue insistence on questions of amour-propre; that the Russians must be allowed at least a semblance of victory, and that it was in their own interests that Germany and Austria should bow the knee before the Tsar.
Moreover, were his es­ teemed friends the Austrians to insist on meddling in Bulgarian af­ fairs, he would wash his hands of them and then they'd see what would happen.
Kâlnoky finally gave way, Alexander Battenberg was sacrificed, and Bismarck went in person to announce the fact to Giers.
There followed the kidnapping of Battenberg by military conspira­ tors in circumstances which could not but shock any monarchically-minded conservative, in particular those princes who had armies of their own.
But at this point Bismarck proceeded to the next item on the agenda, glad to have got off at so little cost.
Unfortunately, the Bulgarians gave evidence of a political aptitude and an energy which, in the circumstances, were highly inopportune, not to say intolerable in a Slav nation 'liberated' by Holy Russia.
They arrested the conspirators and nominated an efficient govern­ ment, energetic and — incorruptible (a quality wholly intolerable in a nation as yet barely emancipated!) which reinstated Battenberg.
The latter thereupon proceeded to exert all his weakness by taking to his heels.
But the Bulgarians proved incorrigible.
Battenberg or no Battenberg, they resisted the supreme orders of the Tsar and forced even the heroic Kaulbars to make an ass of himself in the eyes of all Europe.
634 Imagine the fury of the Tsar! Having curbed Bismarck, having broken the resistance of Austria, to find oneself brought up short by this runt of a nation, weaned only yesterday, which owes its 'inde­ pendence' to oneself or to one's father a and fails to see that the afore­ said independence means nothing more than blind obedience to the 'liberator'! The Greeks and Serbs have not shown themselves wanting in ingratitude, but the Bulgarians exceed all possible bounds.
Taking their independence seriously — has such a thing ever been heard of before? To save himself from revolution, the hapless Tsar was compelled to take another step forward.
But with every new step the peril in­ creased, for it brought closer the risk of European war—something Rus­ sian diplomacy had always been at pains to avoid.
There could be no doubt that, if Russia intervened in Bulgaria, and if such intervention subsequently led to complications, the moment would come when the mutually inimical interests of Russia and Austria would lead to an open clash.
And this time there could be no question of localising the affair.
There would be general war.
And, given the rascals who were at that juncture governing Europe, there was no foreseeing what the a Alexander II composition of the two camps might be.
Bismarck was capable of ally­ ing himself with the Russians against Austria if that was the only way of postponing revolution in Russia.
What seemed more prob­ able, however, was war between Austria and Russia, and that Ger­ many would come to the help of Austria only in case of need, to pre­ vent her being crushed.
While waiting for the spring — for before April the Russians can­ not embark on a major war on the Danube — they did everything they could to lure Turkey into their snare, and Austria and England, by their treachery towards Turkey, furthered this ploy.
Their object was to gain the right to occupy the Dardanelles, thus turning the Black Sea into a Russian lake, an unassailable haven for the organisa­ tion of powerful fleets which would sail out of it to dominate the French lake, as Napoleon called the Mediterranean.
But in this they never succeeded, even though the cat had been let out of the bag by the few adherents they had in Sofia.
Such was the situation.
To avoid revolution in Russia, the Tsar must have Constantinople.
And Bismarck prevaricated, wishing to find some way of avoiding one or the other eventuality.
And what of France? For those Frenchmen whose thoughts, for 16 years, had centred sole­ ly on revenge, it would seem natural enough to seize on what might be a possible opportunity.
But for our party it is not so simple, nor yet even for Messrs the chauvinists.
War against Germany in alliance with Russia might lead to either revolution or counter-revolution in France.
If a revolution were to bring the socialists to power, the al­ liance with Russia would collapse.
In the first place, the Russians would immediately conclude peace with Bismarck so that they might together fall upon revolutionary France.
And in the second, France would not put the socialists in power so that they might fight to prevent revolution in Russia.
But such an eventuality is unlikely to arise.
What is far more likely is a monarchist counter-revolution, promoted by the Russian al­ liance.
You know how greatly the Tsar desires the restoration of the house of Orleans, and that this alone would enable him to conclude a good, stable alliance with France.
Well, the war once embarked upon, good use would be made of the monarchist officers in the army who would help pave the way for the said restoration.
For any partial defeat, however slight — and such there would be — they would blame the Republic, saying that, if victories were to be achieved and the whole-hearted cooperation of their Russian ally secured, there must be a stable, monarchical government — in short, Philippe VIIa; the monarchist generals would themselves act irresolutely so that their failures could be laid at the door of the republican govern­ ment— and hey presto, you've got your monarchy! And, Philippe once installed, all those kings and emperors would suddenly be of one mind and, instead of killing each other, share out Europe between them, swallowing up the smaller states.
Once the French Republic had been killed there'd be another Congress of Vienna650 at which France's republican and socialist sins might, perhaps, be made a pre­ text for refusing her Alsace-Lorraine, whether in whole or in part, and at which the princes would deride the stupidity of the republi­ cans for believing in the possibility of a genuine alliance between tsar-ism and anarchy.
Is it true, by the bye, that General Boulanger is saying to anyone who chooses to hear that war is to France a necessity, in that it is the only way to kill social revolution? If so, let it be a warning to you.
The good Boulanger has a swashbuckling air, excusable perhaps in a sol­ dier, but which gives me a low opinion of his political nous.
It is not he who will save the Republic.
If he had to choose between the social­ ists and the house of Orleans he would, if needs be, come to terms with the latter, especially if it secured the Russian alliance for him.
Whatever the case, the bourgeois republicans in France are in the same boat as the Tsar in Russia; they see before them the spectre of revolution and can see only one means of salvation: war.
In France as is Germany things are going so well for us that all we can wish for is the continuation of the status quo.
And if revolution were to break out in Russia it would create a combination of circum­ stances which could hardly be more favourable.
Whereas if there were to be general war, we should find ourselves back in the realm of uncertainty and of unpredictable events.
Revolution in Russia and France would be averted, our party's splendid development in Ger­ many would be violently interrupted, and the monarchy would prob­ ably be restored in France.
Doubtless all this would eventually re­ dound in our favour, but what a waste of time, what sacrifices, what fresh obstacles to be overcome! a Louis Philippe Albert d'Orléans The temptation to go to war is everywhere great.
In the first place the Prussian military system, universally adopted, takes some 12 to 16 years to complete its development; after that period, all reserve for­ mations are made up of men trained in the handling of weapons.
Everywhere the 12-16-year period has elapsed; everywhere there are 12-16 classes which have passed through the army each year.
Thus everywhere people are prepared, and the Germans no longer enjoy any particular advantage in that respect.
And in the second place, old Williama is probably about to die; then the system will undergo certain changes.
Bismarck will see his position to some extent under­ mined and may himself press for war as the only means of maintaining it.
For others this would represent a further temptation to attack Ger­ many which would seem to them less strong and less stable at a time when internal affairs were in a state of flux.
Indeed, the Stock Ex­ change everywhere believes there will be war as soon as the Old Man has closed his eyes.
As for myself, I believe we must take for granted the fact that the war, if w^r there be, will be conducted simply with a view to prevent­ ing revolution: in Russia, to forestall common action by all malcon­ tents— Slavophils, Constitutionals, Nihilists356 and peasants; in Germany to keep Bismarck in power; in France to stem the victorious progress of the socialists and (or so all the big bourgeoisie hopes) to re-establish the monarchy.
Hence I am for 'peace at any price', seeing that it is not we who will pay that price.

651 The fellow is a simple Streber* who knows that, the thicker he lays it on, the better will be his chance of promotion.
We have got the book here and I shall give Kautsky notes enough to en­ able him to smash the cheeky devil up.
The position he takes is so ut­ terly ridiculous that it will nowhere be accepted unless in national-liberal newspapers, and there we must expect to have it served up again and again, but that is of the utmost indifference.
The Rod-bertus scare was far more serious and that we have already smashed up so completely that it is quite forgotten by this time.
b I don't think even Hyndman will venture to make capital out of this, except perhaps in a very small way.
Now I must begin writing my preface,c as Swan Sonnenschein and Co.
are asking for it, so this looks like coming to a conclusion! Very affectionately yours, F.

-c Preface to the English edition of Volume I of Capital 298 ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON IN ST PETERSBURG London, 9 November 1886 Dear Sir, All this time I have been busy with the English translation of Vol­ ume 15 6 which I hope will now be finished in a few weeks as I have read the first proof-sheets of the whole and only now have to read 2nd and 3rd corrections of the last 10 sheets.
It was very hard work, as af­ ter all I shall be held responsible for the text.
I have not been able to do anything else during that time, and thus a heap of other little mat­ ters have accumulated which I now shall clear off and then return to the 3rd volume.
This, as I believe I told you, I have dictated from the original ms.
into a legible handwriting,a and the greater part of it will not require much revision, but the chapter on the transformation of the rate of surplus value into the rate of profit, and that on banking capital, and to some extent — also that on the rent of land652 will take a deal of working out yet.
I hope to bring the whole out next year, but shall not send anything off to the printer until the whole is completed.
The sale of Volume II up to March 1886 was 1,300 copies.
4 As soon as the English translation is out, I shall forward you a copy.
The reviews of Volume II in the German press have been exceed­ ingly stupid.
One, by a Dr Gross in Vienna, was very decent, b but the man is an idiot.
Another by Professor Lexis in Breslau" is very clever in its way, the man understands the book perfectly, and knows that nothing can be said against it; but he is a 'Streber'' d and therefore disguises himself as a Vulgärökonom.

36, Moscow 1964 Published in English for the first time 301 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE IN PARIS London, 24 November 1886 My dear Laura, I hope you have received the American letters I sent you yester­ day, 655 to-day I can keep my word and write.
Our people have in-deed hit upon a lucky moment for their journey,601 it coincides with the first formation of a real American working men's party and what was practically an immense success, the Henry George 'boom' in New York.
657 Master George is rather a confused sort of a body and being a Yankee, has a nostrum of his own, and not a very excellent one, but his confusion is a very fair expression of the present stage of develop­ ment of the Anglo-American working class mind, and we cannot ex­ pect even American masses to arrive at theoretical perfection in six or eight months — the age of this movement.
And considering that the Germans in America are anything but a fair and adequate sample of the workmen of Germany, but rather of the elements the movement at home has eliminated — Lassalleans, disappointed ambitions, secta­ rians of all sorts— I for one am not sorry that the Americans start in­ dependently of them, or at least of their leadership.
As a ferment the Germans can and will act, and at the same time undergo, themselves, a good deal of useful and necessary fermentation.
The unavoidable starting point, in America, are the Knights of Labor,609 who are a real power, and are sure to form the first embodiment of the move­ ment.
Their absurd organisation and very slippery leaders — used to the methods of corrupt American partisanship — will very soon pro­ voke a crisis within that body itself, and then a more adequate and more effective organisation can be developed from it.
All this I think will not take very long in Yankeeland; the great point gained is that the political action of the working class as an independent party is henceforth established there.
From America to Russia il n'y a qu'un pas.
a Tussy told me last sum­ mer that Lawroff had asked her to write something about Lopatine, and to ask me to do the same, as he was to publish something about him.
I told her that as far as I knew, Lopatine was still awaiting his trial, 362 and that surely under those circumstances Lawroff would not publish anything to aggravate his position; would she therefore again write to Lawroff to know how this was (for it led me almost to conclude Lawroff must have been informed that Lopatine was dead) and what he desired me to say about him.
Since then I have not heard anything more with respect to this matter.
I now see in the pa­ pers that a fresh Nihilist356 trial is coming on in Petersburg, and from the way it is worded, it looks likely that this concerns Lopatine too if he be still alive.
Would you be good enough to ask Lawroff next time a is but a step you see him how all this is, and what he wishes me to do with regard to Lopatine as I shall be always ready and willing to contribute my testimony in confirmation and acknowledgment of the great services he has done to the cause, provided I know what is wanted and what is his position at the present moment.
Thanks to the stupidity of all its rivals and opponents, the Social Democratic Federation 300 is beginning to become a power.
The gov­ ernment saved them from a, four* by forbidding their procession on Lord Mayor's Day, and prepared them a nominal triumph by allow­ ing them to hold what they called a meeting the same afternoon on Trafalgar Square.
And when after that, the Social Democratic Fede­ ration called a meeting for last Sunday on Trafalgar Square,658 the same government made it a real triumph by first announcing that ar­ tillery should be brought out to St.
James Park in readiness to act, and then countermanding this ridiculous plan.
So the meeting—the first where the Social Democratic Federation had announced they would proceed orderly and peaceably — was puffed by the govern­ ment into a great event, and when it did come off orderly and peace­ ably, the bourgeois and Spiessbiirgerh found that whatever the strength of the Social Democratic Federation itself might be, it had a very powerful tail behind it.
The fact is that as the Socialist League346 is too deeply engaged in discussing its own rules and regulations with its anarchist members, to have a moment to spare for events outside No.
18 Farringdon Road, and as the Radical Clubs of the East End659 take no initiative whatever with regard to the unemployed, the Social Democratic Federation have no competitor, are alone in the field, and work this question, which springs up afresh as soon as winter comes on, entirely to their own liking.
And they have certainly of late been far more sensible in their doings — of late, that is to say for the last fortnight.
How long that will last, of course nobody can tell.

a Of course the Liberal papers have made an awful fuss about his discoveries, just as they did about Vogt's.
Only times have changed and we can hit back now, and with effect.
The conspiracy of the bourgeois press in 1859 against us 660 was 1,000 times more effective than Bismarck's contemptible Socialist Law.
37 You have no idea how glad I am that the bookb is at last through the press.
It was impossible to do anything else while it was going on.
The arrangements were of necessity very complicated, proofs being sent to Edward, Moore, and myself, which naturally caused delay and constant pegging on the part of Swan Sonnenschein and Co.
Then, as I only lately found out, the book was printed in — Perth 1.
And considerable neglect of business in Swan Sonnenschein and Co.

Finally, the usual course of things: neglect and delay, on the part of the printers, in summer, then, towards end of September, hurry and worry, just over that part of the ms.

Becker.
662 As to his moving to Zurich, that is a matter I would rather leave to you to deal with direct.
You say that the need for it is perfectly obvious; to you in Zurich that may seem entirely right, but to me here in London, where I am less able to weigh up the pros and cons, the case looks dif­ ferent.
And for that reason I cannot possibly persuade him to move, at the drop of a hat, to Zurich from Geneva to which, after forty years, he has grown accustomed, having become, so to speak, part and par­ cel of the place.
Accordingly I have so far said not a word about the matter.
The English translationa is all but done and once I have paid off my most pressing debts in the shape of letters owed to correspondents, I shall at last be able to attend to the items in suspense reposing in my desk.

6) Theory of Force.
663 You are welcome to go ahead, but what do you mean by 'correspondingly altered'? The purely positive part amounts to no more than a few pages while the anti-Dühring polemic is itself positive and indispensable both factually and technically.
However if you simply mean the deletion of individual passages hav­ ing no particular relevance to the question of force and merely serv­ ing to link together the rest of the text, then I agree.
This will amount to about 25 pages and is rather little.
In my view the 2 chapters, Mo­ rality and Law: Eternal Truths and Equality, could be similarly re­ vised and added on, since these also revolve round the materi­ alist-economic view of history, in which case the whole could be enti­ tled On Law and Force in World History or something of the kind.
7) On Social Relations in Russia.
664 If you reprint the little pamph­ let as it stands I have no objection; a preface to it would mean my embarking on further Russian studies, for which I have absolutely no time; a preface without further studies would provide nothing new and would therefore best be omitted.
The articles relating to it in the Volksstaat would also best be omitted.

If Ede is not wholly engrossed in the Eternal Feminine, b kindly tell him that in my view the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION300 ought now to be handled somewhat differently.
The stupidity of the government, the inaction of the working men's Radical Clubs659 vis-à-vis the enormous growth in the number of 'unemployed' and, finally, the wisdom of the SOCIALIST LEAGUE, 346 whose constant preoccupation with its own rules and regulations leaves it time for nothing else, have provided the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION with so splendid a pitch that not even Hyndman & Co.
have yet managed to queer it.
The SO­ CIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION is beginning to be something of a power, since the masses have absolutely no other organisation to which they can rally.
The facts should therefore be recorded impartially, in parti­ cular the most important fact of all, namely that a genuinely socialist labour movement has come into being over here.
But one must be very careful to draw a distinction between the masses and their tem-In the original mistakenly articles Nos.

As soon as the movement has acquired substance, either it will keep these gen­ tlemen in check or they will destroy themselves.
Hitherto the irrita­ tion felt by the majority has simply taken the form of dull, uncon­ scious dissatisfaction, but it is in this way that the ground has been prepared for sowing.
In America, apart from New York, the real movement is running ahead of the Germans.
The Americans' real organisation is the KNIGHTS OF LABOR 609 which is as muddle-headed as the masses them­ selves.
But it is from this chaos that the movement will evolve, not from the German sections — the Germans, that is, who, for the past 20 years, have proved incapable of extracting from their theory what America needs.
549 But this is just the moment when the Germans might exert a very enlightening influence — if only they had learnt English! Kindest regards to everyone.

Engels to Sorge.
29 November 1886 Stands for any and every need.
To them it is a credo, not a guide to action.
Besides which, they refuse to learn English on principle.
Hence the American masses have had to find a way of their own and would appear to have done so for the time being in the KNIGHTS OF LA­ BOR 609 whose muddle-headed principles and ridiculous organisation would seem to match their own muddle-headedness.
From all that I hear, the KNIGHTS OF LABOR are a real power, particularly in New En­ gland and the West, and are daily becoming more so as a result of the brutality of the capitalist opposition.
It is, I believe, necessary to work in their midst, to form, within this still fairly malleable mass, a nucleus of men who know the movement and its aims and will thus au­ tomatically take over the leadership of at least some part of it when, as is inevitable, the present 'Order' disintegrates.
The worst aspect of the KNIGHTS OF LABOR is their political neutrality whose only result is the sharp practice of the Powderlys, etc.
But this last has had its sting drawn by the response of the masses in the November elections, more especially in New York.
In a country that has newly entered the movement, the first really crucial step is the formation by the workers of an independent political party, no matter how, so long as it is distin­ guishable as a labour party.
And this step has been taken far sooner than we might have expected, and that's the main thing.
That the first programme of this party should still be muddle-headed and ex­ tremely inadequate,3 that it should have picked Henry George for its figurehead, are unavoidable if merely transitory evils.
The masses must have the time and the opportunity to evolve; and they will not get that opportunity until they have a movement of their own — no matter what its form, providing it is their own movement — in which they are impelled onwards by their own mistakes and learn by bitter experience.
The movement in America is at the same stage as it was at home before 1848; the really intelligent chaps will at first play the same role over there as did the Communist League before 1848 among the working men's associations.
13 Save that in America things will move infinitely faster; for it is completely unprecedented for a movement to achieve such electoral successes after an existence of barely eight months.
And what is still lacking, the bourgeois will make good; no­ where else irt the world do they behave so outrageously and tyranically a See Der Sozialist, No.

as there, and your judges knock Bismarck's imperial pettifoggers into a cocked hat.
When the struggle is conducted by the bourgeois with weapons such as these, it will rapidly come quickly to a head and, un­ less we in Europe bestir ourselves, the Americans will soon steal a march on us.
But just now it is doubly necessary to have a few chaps on our side who are thoroughly versed in theory and in well-tried tactics and who can also speak and write English, since the Ameri­ cans, for good historical reasons, lag far behind in all theoretical mat­ ters; true, they did not bring with them from Europe any medieval in­ stitutions, but instead a mass of medieval traditions—religion, En­ glish common (feudal) law, superstition, spiritualism — in short, every kind of balderdash that was not immediately harmful to busi­ ness and now comes in very handy for the stultification of the masses.
And if people are available whose clear grasp of theory enables them to tell the Americans what the consequences of their mistakes are like­ ly to be, and make them see that any movement which does not constantly bear in mind that the ultimate goal is the destruction of the wage system, must necessarily go astray and come to nothing, then much silliness can be avoided and the process be considerably curtailed.
But it must be done in English, the specifically German character must be sloughed off, and this the gentlemen of the Sozial­ ist are hardly qualified to do, while those of the Volkszeitung may be shrewder, but only in regard to business.
The American elections this month made a tremendous impact on Europe.
The absence up till now of a labour movement in England, and more especially in America, has been the great trump card of radical Republicans everywhere, notably in France.
Now these chaps are utterly dumbfounded — Mr Clemenceau in particular who, on 2 November, witnessed the collapse of all that his policy was based on.
'Just look at America,' he never tired of saying, 'that's a real re­ public for you — no poverty and no labour movement!' And it's the same with the men of Progress 93 and 'democrats' in Germany and over here — where they are just experiencing an incipient movement of their own.
What has completely stunned these people is the fact that the movement is so strongly accentuated as a labour movement, and that it has sprung up so suddenly and with such force.
Over here it was the absence of all competition on the one hand and the stupidity of the government on the other that enabled the gentlemen of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION 300 to assume a posi­ tion to which they would never have ventured to aspire 3 months ago.
The hoo-hah that was created about the plan — never seriously con­ templated — to form a procession behind the LORD MAYOR'S a Show on 9 November, and the similar hoo-hah later on, about the Trafalgar Square meeting of 21 November b when, despite talk of bringing up the artillery, the government eventually had to back down — all this at long last compelled the gents of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION to hold a quite ordinary meeting on the 21st, without any hollow rhodo-montade or pseudo-revolutionary demonstrations with their obbli-gato plebeian accompaniment,— and all of a sudden the philistines began to feel respect for the men who had stirred up so much dust and yet behaved so reputably.
658 And, since no one except the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION bother about the UNEMPLOYED whose numbers, in these days of chronic stagnation of trade, increase substantially every winter and who suffer extreme want, the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FE­ DERATION can hardly fail to win.
In this country we now have the be­ ginnings of a labour movement, AND NO MISTAKE, and if the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION is the first to reap the reward, this will be due to the cowardice of the Radicals and the stupidity of the SOCIALIST LEAGUE 346 which is bickering with the anarchists, is unable to shake them off and hence has no time to spare for the real live movement that is taking place there under its very nose.
How long, for that matter, Hyndman & Co.
will continue to act in this relatively rational way remains to be seen.
I anticipate that, being in too much of a hurry, they will before long again perpetrate the most colossal blunders, whereupon they'll discover that, in a serious movement, this simply won't do.
In Germany things are getting nicer and nicer — sentences in Leipzig of up to 4 years' hard labour for 'insurrection'!666 They are absolutely determined to provoke a rumpus.
I now have 7 lesser jobs in my desk—Italian and French transla­ tions, prefaces, new editions, etc.

And to cut short any further excuses, I enclose a check for £20.
-to enable you to per­ form your promise.
Also a letter from Tussy, who was yesterday in Williamsport, Penn­ sylvania, and will have meetings after that in Baltimore, Wilmington and New York — but in New York a whole series from 19th to 23rd, and leave on 25th.
60' Another letter from Edward will be sent to­ morrow, I have to make a note or two out of it.
Please bring all these letters with you when you come for I have a strong suspicion that they were written with one eye to business, for I find that Liebknecht also wrote almost daily his impressions de voyage to his wife, not so much for her sake as for that of forming the material basis of a book already contracted for.
Last Wednesday weeka Mrs Liebknecht arrived here, an extremely German lady, and before 24 hours had passed, she began to unbosom herself to Nim with an eagerness that was almost too much for Nim.
The household seems to be a model German one, Sentimentalität und häuslicher £wist, h but considerably more of the latter.
Nim will tell you more anon.
On Sunday afternoon Liebknecht dropped in, more hungry than usual, fortunately there was a boiled leg of mutton to ap­ pease his craving.
He is quite the old Liebknecht, only Nim who has got the deepest inside in his household mysteries affirms that he is somewhat more of a Philistine.
What Tussy says of him is quite cor­ rect, his notion of his own importance, capacities and absolute invin­ cibility is astounding; but at the same time there is an undercurrent of a dim apprehension that after all he is not the stupendous man that he would like the people to believe him to be; which undercurrent drives him to be more in want of other people's admiration than he otherwise would be, and in order to obtain that, to manipulate facts considerably in all his tales about himself.
But his wife says with truth that if he was not so immensely satisfied with himself, he would never be able to do the work he does.
So we must take him as he is and be satisfied with a quiet laugh at much of what he says; he will create much mischief in a small way by his diplomatising ways pro aris etfo-cis, c but at the decisive moment he will always take the right side.
They left on Friday for Leipzig.
Percy is quite well again, he always has these violent attacks, but if once over the first assault, he is soon right again.
The Kautskys are taking a house beyond the Archway — not the Archway Tavern but the real Archway farther on.
That is to say, Scheu takes the house for three years, and takes part of it with his daughter, a rather silly girl of about 18 whom he has got over from Hungary; and the Kautskys take the other part.
They are beginning to move into it to-day and hope to have done with it by Saturday.
I had a letter last week from old Harney, he sailed 12th October, much too late for his condition of body, and of course arrived rheu­ matic and gouty all over.
But he could not leave England which he adores while he hates America, and if he lives, he says he will come a 1 December -b sentimentality and household quarrels-0 for our altars and firesides (Cicero, De natura deorum, III, 40, 94) across again next spring and live and die in England! Poor fellow — when the Chartist movement broke down he found himself adrift and the glorious time of free-trade prosperity in England was indeed enough to drive a fellow to despair.
Then he went to Boston, only to find there, in an exaggerated form and ruling supreme, those very things and qualities he had hated most in England.
And now when a real movement begins on both sides of the Atlantic amongst the En­ glish speaking nations, he is too old, too decrepit, too much an out­ sider, and — too patriotic to follow it.
All he has learnt in America is British chauvinism! Now Nim comes and brings me the out-of-the-way stamps to affix to this uncommon heavy letter, while Anni is getting the dinner things into shape and so I must conclude.
Nim sends her love to both of you.
As to Paul you will perhaps after all succeed in bringing him with you on the 23rd, what in the name of dickens is he going to mopse in Paris in Christmas week, not even the chambers sitting? Ever affectionately yours, F.

IN ENGELSKIRCHEN London, 22 December 1886 Dear Emil, I was very pleased to hear from you again and through you from your mother3 and all the others.
As to your request, it occurs to me that it would be considered gross inconsistency on my part if/wished to contribute 150 marks to the Protestant Institute in Barmen because the aims it pursued were, as " Charlotte Engels a rule, generally worthy.
I believe your father-in-lawa would likewise think it inconsistent were he to make a donation to an avowedly So­ cial Democratic workers' fund on account of its generally worthy aims.
But where there's a will there's a way and since in any case it al­ ways strikes me as somewhat comical whenever I see myself listed in the books as a shareholder of the Protestant Institute, I hereby pre-sentyou with both the shares to do with as you please.
I enclose a note for Hermann*3 who will, I trust, attend to the matter.
I am glad to hear that you are all well and especially that your mother's solicitude for her children and grandchildren is giving her a new lease of life.
All of you will indeed miss your father0 for a long time to come, both in the family and in the business.
He was every inch a man and such a one will never be replaced in the family and only with difficulty in the business.
However it will be a great help to you young people to step into positions of responsibility early on; un­ fortunately it was rare enough in Germany in my day, yet it is absolute­ ly essential to the formation of the mind and particularly of the cha­ racter.
So let the elderly gentlemen amuse themselves in Barmen and in summer use Engelskirchen more for recuperation than for business.
If you can run the firm on your own, so much the better; it will give you self-confidence.
But now I must close; Schorlemmer will be arriving from Manches­ ter in a few minutes and tomorrow I expect more visitors from Paris d; we shall therefore have a full house and that will put paid to my work and also to my correspondence.
However I was anxious to settle the matter of the shares beforehand and have used my last free moment for this purpose.
So my particularly fond regards to your mother and to your wife,e your boy,f Hermanns8 and Moritz h and regards to yourself From your Uncle Friedrich And in particular a very Merry Christmas and prosperous New Year to you all.

W.
Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky, Your letter of November 13th never reached me, of which I am very sorry; it would have suited me much better to write a preface then, and moreover would have left me more time.
671 But let me first congratulate you on the happy family event in which you have been the principal actor and add my best wishes for your own health and that of the little one newly arrived.
Of course the appendix2 is now a little out-of-date, and as I antici­ pated something of the kind, proposed that it should be written when the book was ready through the press.
Now a preface will be much wanted, and I will write you one; but before, I must await the return of the Avelings60 ' to have a full report of the state of things in Ame­ rica; and it seems to me that my preface will not be exactly what you desire.
First you seem to me to treat New York a little as the Paris of Ame­ rica, and to overrate the importance, for the country at large, of the local New York movement with its local features.
No doubt it has a great importance, but then the North-West with its background of a numerous farming population and its independent movement will hardly accept blindly the George theory.
Secondly the preface of this book is hardly the place for a thorough­ going criticism of that theory, and offers even not the necessary space for it.
Thirdly I should have to study thoroughly Henry George's various writings and speeches672 (most of which I have not got) so as to render impossible all replies based on subterfuges and side-issues.
My preface will of course turn entirely on the immense stride made by the American working-men in the last ten months, and naturally a F.
Engels, 'Appendix to the American Edition of The Condition of the Working Class in EnglantT.
also touch Henry George and his land scheme.
But it cannot pretend to deal extensively with it.
Nor do I think the time for that has come.
It is far more important that the movement should spread, proceed harmoniously, take root and embrace as much as possible the whole American proletariat, than that it should start and proceed, from the beginning, on theoretically perfectly correct lines.
There is no better road to theoretical clearness of comprehension than to learn by one's own mistakes, 'durch Schaden klug werden'.
And for a whole large class, there is no other road, especially for a nation so eminently practical and so contemptuous of theory as the Americans.
The great thing is to get the working-class to move as a class; that once obtained, they will soon find the right direction, and all who resist, Henry George or Powderly, will be left out in the cold with small sects of their own.
Therefore I think also the Knights of Labor 609 a most important fac­ tor in the movement which ought not to be pooh-poohed from with­ out but to be revolutionised from within, and I consider that many of the Germans there have made a grievous mistake when they tried, in the face of a mighty and glorious movement not of their creation, to make of their imported and not always understood theory a kind of alleinseligmachendes Dogma,* and to keep aloof from any movement which did not accept that dogma.
Our theory is not a dogma but the exposition of a process of evolution, and that process involves succes­ sive phases.
To expect that the Americans will start with the full con­ sciousness of the theory worked out in older industrial countries is to expect the impossible.
What the Germans ought to do is to act up to their own theory — if they understand it, as we did in 1845 and 1848,— to go in for any real general working-class movement, accept its faktische h starting point as such, and work it gradually up to the theoretical level by pointing out how every mistake made, every re­ verse suffered, was a necessary consequence of mistaken theoretical views in the original programme: they ought, in the words of the Kom­ munistischen Manifest: Hn der Gegenwart der Bewegung die Zukunft der Bewe­ gung zu repräsentieren' .
c 613 But above all give the movement time to consolidate, do not make the inevitable confusion of the first start, worse confounded by forcing down people's throats things which, at present, they cannot properly understand, but which they will soon learn.
A million or two of working-men's votes next November for a the only saving dogma -b actual -c 'in the movement of the present to represent the future of the movement'.
a bona fide working-men's party is worth infinitely more at present than a hundred thousand votes for a doctrinally perfect platform.
The very first attempt — soon to be made if the movement progres­ ses— to consolidate the moving masses on a national basis — will bring them all face to face, Georgites, Knights of Labor, Trade-Unionists and all; and if our German friends by that time have learnt enough of the language of the country to go in for a discussion, then will be the time for them to criticise the views of the others and thus, by showing up the inconsistencies of the various standpoints, to bring them gradually to understand their own actual position, the position made for them by the correlation of capital and wage labour.
But anything that might delay or prevent that national consolidation of the working-men's party — on no matter what platform—I should consider a great mistake, and therefore I do not think the time has ar­ rived to speak out fully and exhaustively either with regard to Henry George or the Knights of Labor.
I did not wire 'yes' because I could not exactly make out what you might make out that 'yes' to mean.
As to the title: /cannot omit the 1844, because the omission would give an entirely false idea of what the reader has to expect.
And as I, by the preface and appendix, take a certain responsibility, I cannot consent to its being left out.
You may add: 'With preface and appen­ dix by the Author', if you think proper.
The proofs I return corrected by same mail.

My dear Tussy, You know I would do anything in my forces to please our friend Donkin, but I am afraid I cannot do so in this case.
The work I have had in hand for the last few years is so urgent and of such dimensions 675 that I have had to give up, once for all, attend­ ing meetings and societies and taking part in discussions or preparing for such.
If I am to accomplish my work, I cannot break through this rule, and the less so, as having given way once, I could not plead the same reason again for refusing in other cases.
Moreover the subject I am asked to discuss, has been lost sights of by me for more than a year,676 and I should therefore be compelled to read it up again and to look at whatever has been published since with respect to it, which would take me more than a week to be exclu­ sively devoted to that purpose, and that week, I am sorry to say, I cannot spare.
And therefore, highly flattered as I feel by the invitation, I very much regret that circumstances will not allow me to avail myself of it.

My dear Dr Donkin, I have heard of the Club—and I am much obliged to Mr Pearson for asking me to join it.
678 But I cannot — for these reasons.
First, I think many members of the Club would decidedly object to my be­ longing to it.
You see, it is a very different matter to advocate certain things, in theory, and to have the courage to put one's theory into practice.
Probably, many of the good ladies in the Club would be much shocked at the idea of my becoming a member of it, and I should only be giving Mr Pearson trouble if I accepted his friendly suggestion.
But there is also another reason.
I have, as it is, hardly a moment of time for real study, a half the work I ought to do I don't do.
And apart from this, any time not taken up in trying to earn bread (and it is so difficult for a woman to do like that!) I feel I must give to what seems to me the highest and most important work I could do — i.
e.
the propaganda of Socialism.
It would not be right to join this Club well knowing that I could not undertake to 'wilt progress' for it, or attend its meetings regularly, or even take such an interest in it as a member ought to take.
If, how­ ever, mere 'visitors' are admitted, and no one objects to me, I shall be very glad to go to any meeting and take part in any discussion on a question of which I know something.
679 — Please thank Mr Pear-son very much for asking me.
I have often wished to meet him, but have always, somehow, missed doing it.
If I went to the Club on an evening, I should be glad if it could be when you are there! Yours very sincerely, Eleanor Marx-Aveling First published in Die Wahrheit, Nr.

Apart from extensive eco­ nomic manuscripts (including the manuscripts of the second and third books of Capi­ tal; see Note 4), he found a large number of diverse conspectuses, excerpts, letters and documents on the working-class movement (see notes 57, 72, 174).
It took En-gels until late March 1884 to put the archives in order, whereupon he moved all the manuscripts which had survived and the correspondence to his own house.
He was faced with tasks of enormous dimensions, namely preparing for the press Marx's un­ finished works, notably volumes II and III of Capital.
— 3, 6, 33 3 On 31 March 1883 Pyotr Lavrov informed Engels from Paris that he was sending him a postal order which he had received from the students of Technological Insti­ tute and Russian women students with the request that it be used to buy a wreath to be laid on Marx's grave.
Engels had an announcement printed in Der Sozialdemokrat of 3 May 1883 to the effect that the request had been carried out (see F.
Engels, 'On the Death of Karl Marx', present edition, Vol.
24, p.
473).
— 3 4 Engels is referring to the manuscripts of the second and third books of Capital, writ­ ten by Marx.
As he studied Marx's manuscripts, Engels was able to establish within certain limits the time span in which they must have been written (see Engels' pre­ faces to volumes II and III of Capital, present edition, vols 36 and 37).
By the spring of 1884 Engels became convinced of the need to change Marx's original plan accord­ ing to which the second volume of Capital was to consist of two books and decided to publish the manuscripts of these books as volumes II and III oi Capital (see this volume, pp.
121, 122).
When preparing Volume II for the press, Engels used the la­ ter versions of the drafts (see Note 17) which came to his notice afterwards (see En-gels' letters to Johann Philipp Becker of 22 May, to Friedrich Adolph Sorge of 29 June and to Karl Kautsky of 18 September 1883).
The second volume of Capital, edited by Engels, appeared in 1885, and the third in 1894 —3, 6, 26, 29, 88, 121, 348, 522 5 The idea of writing a study of dialectics came to Marx in late 1857 or early 1858 when Ferdinand Freiligrath gave him — most probably after 22 October 1857 — an incomplete set of Hegel's Works.
On 16 January 1858, Marx wrote to Engels: Tf ever the time comes when such work is again possible, I should very much like to write 2 or 3 sheets making accessible to the common reader the rational aspect of the method which Hegel not only discovered but also mystified' (see present edition, Vol.
40, p.
249).
Marx was going to call the study 'Dialectic' (see his letter to Joseph Dietzgen of 9 May 1868, present edition, Vol.
43, p.
31), but this plan failed to materialise.
— 3 6 On 24 February 1883 Hermann Lopatin fled from exile in Vologda to Paris, whence he proceeded to London in September 1883.
— 4 ' Engels is referring to the sister of Paul Lafargue's mother.
It is clear from Laura's let­ ter to Engels of 4 May 1883 that Lafargue's mother lived together with her sister and the latter's children in Bordeaux.
— 4 8 The family of Jenny, Marx's eldest daughter who died in January 1883 — her husband Charles Longuet and their four children — lived, in Argenteuil near Paris.
— 4 9 Paul Lafargue, Jules Guesde and Jean Dormoy were tried by a jury in Moulins in late April 1883 for their actions in the province of Montluçon and elsewhere in the au­ tumn of 1882; the charges brought against them were conspiracy and incitement to civil war.
The court sentenced each of them to six months' imprisonment as well as imposing fines.
Guesde and Lafargue served their sentences in Ste Pélagie prison, Paris, from 21 May to 21 November 1883 (see Note 402).
—5, 20, 28, 30, 41, 46, 48, 59, 61, 64, 115 1 ° No information is available on the French edition of the Manifesto mentioned by Engels.
In all probability it never materialised.
— 5 1 ' In his letter of 17 March 1883, Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, on behalf of the Dutch Socialist Workers' Party, asked Engels to 'pass on our homage and grateful acknowledgement, to the Marx family and to all those who join us in mourning at the grave of the master'.
Nieuwenhuis also informed Engels that he planned to translate his work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific into Dutch, which he actually did in 1886.
Nieuwenhuis further enquired about Engels' plan with regard to Volume II of Marx's Capital, further study of the English labour movement after 1845 and the reissue of Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in England.
— 6 12 Engels is referring to the Social-Democratic Association of the Netherlands which was formed in 1881 and united in a single party the Social-Democratic associations of Amsterdam, The Hague, Haarlem and Rotterdam.
The associations had been formed in 1878-81 with the active involvement of former members of the Dutch section of the First International.
Nieuwenhuis was among the founders of the new organisation.
— 6 13 The London monthly The Republican carried a short obituary entitled 'Karl Marx' in its issue of April 1883 containing a reference to the November issue of 1882 which had published a biography and photo of Marx.
— 7 14 In his letter of reply to Engels of 16 April 1883, Eduard Bernstein confirmed that the wood block of Marx's portrait was in the possession of the editorial board of Der Sozialdemokrat.
— 7 15 The reference is to the third congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany which was held illegally in Copenhagen from 29 March to 2 April 1883, with 60 delegates taking part.
The congress was to work out the German Social Democrats' political line on the social reforms being carried out by the bourgeois government, to decide on the party's tactics and the position to be taken by Der Sozialdemokrat, its printed organ, given the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany (see Note 37).
The congress unanimously called on the party to expose the demagogy of Bismarck's do­ mestic policy, endorsed the stance of the main printed organ and the general line of conduct of the parliamentary group (see Note 49).
It further made it incumbent on every party member, including the Social-Democratic representatives in the Reichs­ tag, to observe party discipline and help carry out party decisions (see also Note 16).
—7, 14, 21 16 Engels is probably referring to the first report on the Copenhagen Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany carried by Der Sozialdemokrat of 12 April 1883.
('Kongreß der deutschen Sozialdemokratie.
Abgehalten in Kopenhagen vom 29.
März bis 2.
April 1883'.
) Subsequent reports were printed by the newspa­ per on 19 and 26 April.
— 7 17 Eight of Marx's draft manuscripts for Volume II (Book II, as he originally inten­ ded) of Capital have survived.
The longest of them, consisting of three lengthy chapters, is Manuscript I.
It was completed in the spring of 1865, and Engels subse­ quently turned it into parts of Volume II.
Since he did not regard the said manu­ script as the final version of Book II, as he was preparing Volume I of Capital for the press Marx wrote Manuscript III (in which he gave a conspectus of works appar­ ently intended for quotation in Volume II) and Manuscript IV, which Engels later described as 'an elaboration, ready for the press, of Part I and the first chapters of Part II of Book IF (see present edition, Vol.
36, Preface).
In 1868-70 Marx wrote a completely new version of the second book, i.
e.
Manuscript II.
The reason why manuscripts III and IV appeared earlier than Manuscript II is that, when he was numbering the drafts of Volume II in the late seventies, Marx started with the two complete versions and followed them with the outlines of individual parts.
In the latter half of the 1870s Marx resumed work on Book II, having realised that it was not complete; although he had examined the simple reproduction of capital in great detail in Manuscript II, he had not analysed its extended reproduction.
Manu­ scripts V, VI and VII appeared between April 1877 and July 1878 and were an at­ tempt to turn the text into a suitable form for printing.
The final version of the sec­ ond book of Capital was Manuscript VIII on which Marx seems to have worked between the autumn of 1879 and early 1880.
Later it was used in full by Engels when preparing Part III of Volume IL— 8, 14, 18, 26, 33, 43, 53, 58, 88, 154, 160, 244 18 This letter is the reply to the letter by the editor of The Nineteenth Century, Thomas James Knowles, of 7 April 1883 in which the latter requested Engels to send him a short resume in English of Volume I of Marx's Capital for an article his journal was planning to publish on the subject.
— 8 19 This letter was written by Engels in reply to that by Philipp Van Patten of 2 April 1883.
In it the latter informed Engels that at a meeting dedicated to Marx's me­ mory Johann Most' and his supporters had claimed Most had been on intimate terms with Marx, that he had helped to popularise Capital in Germany and his propaganda work had enjoyed Marx's support.
Engels' letter and an excerpt from that by Van Patten were published in German in Engels' article 'On the Death of Karl Marx' carried by Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
21 of 17 May 1883 (see present edi­ tion, Vol.
24).
Engels made several changes in the German text of his letter the most important of which are given in the footnotes.

—9 20 The reference is to the disruptive activities in the International of Mikhail Bakunin and his supporters.
In the autumn of 1868 in Geneva they founded the Interna­ tional Alliance of Socialist Democracy, an organisation with its own programme and rules that contradicted those of the International (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
207-11).
Following the refusal by the General Council of the International Working Men's Association to admit the Alliance to the International, in 1869 Bakunin, in violation of the promise he had given to disband his organisation, secretly intro­ duced the Alliance into the International with the aim of seizing its leadership.
Posing as sections of the International, sections of the Alliance publicised their anarchist programme, claiming it was the programme of the International.
In November 1871, the Bakuninists' congress in Sonvillier, Switzerland, called for a revision of the International's Rules, notably the articles on the importance of the political struggle by the working class and its party.
— 10, 108 21 At the Hague Congress of the First International (2-7 September 1872) a special commission was formed to investigate the secret activities of the Alliance.
On the strength of the materials it studied, the commission concluded that the activities of the Alliance were incompatible with membership in the International, as were the activities of the leaders of the former, Bakunin and Guillaume.
Having generally ac­ cepted the commission's proposals, the Hague Congress decided to publicise the documents at the commission's disposal concerning the Alliance and expelled Bakunin and Guillaume from the International.
— 10 22 In his reply of 18 April 1883 to Engels' letter of 17 April (see this volume, pp.
8-9), Thomas James Knowles wrote that he was intending to include in the journal The Nineteenth Century the English translation of Engels' Synopsis of Volume One of 'Capi­ tal' by Karl Marx (see present edition, Vol.
20, pp.
263-308) complete with the au­ thor's name.
Knowles intended to publish in the same issue an article about Marx written by Maltman Barry, who had been a member of the International.
—12 23 In mid-November 1850 Engels joined the Manchester branch of the German tex­ tiles firm Ermen & Engels.
The German side of the enterprise was run by Fr.
Engels (Senior) with the assistance of Anthony Ermen.
The firm's office was in Barmen.
Following the death of his father in 1860, Engels received £ 10,000 from his broth­ ers as compensation for renouncing his rights to the factory in Engelskirchen, which bolstered his financial and legal status in the Manchester firm.
Engels was a co-owner of the Manchester firm of Ermen & Engels for five years between June 1864 and June 1869.
At the end of this period he left the firm to con­ centrate on party, academic and journalistic work.
— 12 24 Engels wrote this letter on a postcard.
The address, also in his hand, reads: Herrn Ed.

— 12, 72 25 The reference is to Engels' Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (see present edition, Vol.
24) which in 1883 was published in three German editions running to a total of 10,000 copies.
The work was composed of three revised chapters by Engels from his work Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science (Anti-Diihring) (see present edition, Vol.
25).
—12, 15, 37, 60 26 The article by Engels which is referred to in this letter was published in Der Sozial­ demokrat, Nos.
19 and 21, 3 and 17 May 1883, under the heading 'On the Death of Karl Marx' (see present edition, Vol.
24).
It was written in reply to the articles about Marx and Engels by Brousse, a Possibilist leader (see Note 237), which had been carried by Le Prolétaire, Nos.

—13, 382, 419 28 The New Yorker Volkszeitung, No.
68, 20 March 1883 reported that, on 19 March, after a meeting of New York workers in memory of Marx, Engels had been sent the following telegram: 'The proletariat of New York, assembled at the Cooper Insti­ tute, honours the memory of its immortal Karl Marx and calls on its brothers: Workers of all countries, unite!'—14 29 The trip was planned for the spring of 1884 with the aim of collecting funds from the workers to finance the election campaign for the Reichstag in the autumn of that year.
However, Wilhelm Liebknecht was not able to go to the United States until the autumn of 1886, and with a different aim in mind (see Note 600).
—14, 114 30 Engels attached a great deal of importance to publicising Marx's theoretical and practical revolutionary activity.
With this aim in mind, he wrote three biographies of Marx at different times — in 1869, 1877 and 1892 — and for different publica­ tions (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
59-64, Vol.
24, pp.
183-95 and Vol.
27, pp.
332-43).
The new biography which Engels planned, taking account of the extensive correspondence and other materials which had survived, and to which he refers in this letter, was not written.
—14, 17, 26, 40, 79 31 On 19 March 1883 Friedrich Adolph Sorge informed Engels that Henry George's propaganda in America was leading the labour movement astray and suggested the publication of the letter Marx had written to him on 20 June 1881 (see present edi­ tion, Vol.
46).
This letter contained a critique of Henry George's book Progress and Poverty which had been published in New York in 1880.
However, Engels consid­ ered that it would be rather premature to publish Marx's letter in the American press (see this volume, p.
42, and Engels' letter to Sorge of 18 June 1887, present edition, Vol.
48).
Engels gave a critical exposé of George's views of the nationalisa­ tion of land in the Preface to the American edition of his book The Condition of the Working-Class in England (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
437-39).
— 14, 114 32 When he learned that Engels' pamphlet Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (present edition, Vol.
24; see also Note 25) was about to appear, Sorge wrote on 19 March 1883 that he could request Otto Weydemeyer to translate it into English and have it published in the United States.
The publication failed to materialise.
— 15 33 Eduard Bernstein was returning to Switzerland from Copenhagen where he had been a delegate to the congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (see Note 15).
—15 34 Following the introduction of a local state of siege in Leipzig in 1881 (see Note 67), Wilhelm Liebknecht, August Bebel and other German socialists had been forced to leave the city.
They settled in the village of Borsdorf near Leipzig.
— 16, 19, 20, 47, 52, 80, 83, 147, 258, 377, 380, 417, 445, 495 35 Engels was unable to carry out these plans due to the enormous demands made on him by the preparation for the press of volumes I and II oiCapital and the publica­ tion of translations of Marx's and his own works.
At the same time, he was work­ ing on his book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (see Note 174).
—17 36 On 17 March 1883, August Bebel informed Engels that at the forthcoming congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany in Copenhagen (see Note 15) he intend­ ed to put up for discussion the question of the party erecting a monument to Marx.
It seems that the stance taken by Marx's family, about which Engels informed Be­ bel in this letter, long remained an obstacle to the erection of a monument in High-gate Cemetery where Marx was buried.
In 1954 the Marx grave was moved to a better place in the cemetery.
Lawrence Bradshaw was commissioned by the Com­ munist Party of Great Britain to sculpt a bronze head of Marx, and the monument which incorporated it was unveiled in 1956 by Harry Pollit, then General Secretary of the British Communist Party.
— 17 37 The Exceptional Law Against the Socialists (Gesetz gegen die gemeingefährlichen Bestrebungen der Sozialdemokratie — the Law against the Harmful and Dan­ gerous Aspirations of Social Democracy) was introduced by the Bismarck govern­ ment, supported by the majority in the Reichstag, on 21 October 1878 to counter the socialist and workers' movement.
This law, better known as the Anti-Socialist Law, made the Social-Democratic Party of Germany illegal, banned all party and mass workers' organisations, and the socialist and workers' press; on the basis of this law socialist literature was confiscated and Social Democrats subjected to reprisals.
However, during its operation the Social-Democratic Party, assisted by Marx and Engels, uprooted both reformist and anarchist elements and managed to substan­ tially strengthen and widen its influence among the people by skilfully combining illegal and legal methods of work.
Under pressure from the mass workers' move­ ment, the Anti-Socialist Law was abrogated on 1 October 1890.
For Engels' assess­ ment of this law, see his article 'Bismarck and the German Working Men's Party' (present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
407-09).

From Per­ sonal Observation and Authentic Sources (see present edition, Vol.
4) which was put out in early 1845 by Otto Wigand's publishing house in Leipzig.
In 1872-73 Engels dis­ cussed with Liebknecht the plan for a second edition of his book since the latter was planning to publish it in a socio-political literature series with the participation of the editorial board of Der Volksstaat (see present edition, Vol.
44, pp.
375, 477).
It is clear from the letters which Wilhelm Liebknecht and Adolf Hepner wrote to En-gels in early 1873 that they helped to sort out Engels' legal relations with the Leip­ zig publishing house.
However, this matter was not clarified for the next 12 years (see Engels' letter of 19 January 1885 to August Bebel, this volume, p.
253).
The second authorised edition of The Condition of the Working-Class in England was not published until 1892 by Dietz.

—20 42 On 6June 1879 Wilhelm Bracke wrote to Engels, T admire Bebel; he is the only one among us with the skills for life in parliament.
'—20 43 August Bebel failed to obtain election to the Reichstag at the 1881 poll.
In April 1883 Social Democrats in Hamburg nominated Bebel as a candidate at the addi­ tional elections being held then.
On 2 May 1883 Bebel wrote to Engels that, given the relatively poor effect of campaigning and particularly parliamentary work against the background of the Anti-Socialist Law, he had requested the voters in Hamburg not to nominate him as a candidate.
However, this letter did not arrive until after he had been elected to the Reichstag on 29 June.
— 20 44 The half-and-halfs — representatives of the Right wing of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany grouped at that time around Wilhelm Bios and Bruno Geiser.
The decision of the Copenhagen Congress (see Note 15) of Social-Democratic can­ didates nominated for the elections to the Reichstag was directed against them.
It stated that the candidates should fully endorse the party programme, observe party discipline and help implement party decisions (see Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
17, 19 April 1883).
—21 45 When the question of the merger of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (Eise-nachers) and the Lassallean General Association of German Workers was being dis­ cussed in the early 1870s, Marx and Engels considered this step to be premature.
They believed that joint political activity 'against the common foe' should precede the establishment of a united party and the elaboration of its programme (see K.
Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme, F.
Engels to A.
Bebel, 18-28 March 1875, present edition, Vol.
24, p.
78).
At the Gotha Unity Congress (22-27 May 1875) the Lassallean Wilhelm Hasenclever was elected a co-chairman of the party Executive Committee, and in June 1875 Wilhelm Hasselmann joined the board of the party-Notes owned national German co-operative printing office in Berlin which had been formed by decision of the Congress.
— 21 46 On 2 May 1883, Bebel wrote to Engels that 'Liebknecht, instead of showing the toughness [against Right-wing and the half-and-half members of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany] he ought, is doing his utmost to blur and hush up the conflicts.
He has the half-and-halfs for protection.
' On the half-and-halfs, see Note 44.
— 21 47 The reference is to Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche's and Louis Viereck's journey around the USA from February to May 1881 on an assignment for the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.
The purpose of the journey was to engage in propa­ ganda work and collect money for the election campaign to the Reichstag.
The elections were due to take place that autumn.

-22, 80 48 In the latter half of April and early May 1883 the Reichstag discussed a bill on workers' health insurance and one providing for changes in trade regulations; the two bills were part of Bismarck's so-called social reform (see Note 312).
On 2 May 1883 Bebel informed Engels that some of the Social-Democratic deputies — including Moritz Rittingshausen and Max Kayser — had intended to vote in fa­ vour of these bills.
However, they had submitted to party discipline and voted against them along with the remainder of the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag on 31 May and 2 June 1883, respectively.
— 22 49 The reference is to the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag which in 1880 was officially recognised as the party centre at the illegal congress in Wyden, Switzer­ land, against the background of the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37).
Prior to that the party centre was in fact the Relief Committee for the repressed Social Democrats set up in 1878.
—22, 145, 381 50 Wilhelm Bios was expelled from Hamburg in late 1880 in connection with the intro­ duction of a so-called local state of siege (see Note 67) in some places in Germany.
His letter to Engels from Bremen of 4 February 1881 showed that he was disturbed at the reaction which had ensued and was in a liquidationist mood, which was man­ ifested in particular by his proposal to dissolve the Socialist Workers' Party of Ger­ many.
— 23 51 On 2 May 1883 Bebel wrote to Engels that symptoms were apparent in various branches of the German economy which suggested the approach of a crisis.

-24 54 The armchair socialists — representatives of a trend in German bourgeois political economy which emerged in the last third of the 19th century in response to the growth of the workers' movement and the spread within it of the ideas of scientific socialism.
They preached bourgeois reformism at universities, passing it off as so­ cialism.
They alleged that the state, specifically the German Empire, was above all classes and could help achieve improvements in the condition of the working class by way of social reforms.

— 25, 98 56 The idea of translating Capital into English occurred to Marx as early as 1865, when he was working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels of 31 July 1865, present edition, Vol.
42).
The British journalist and member of the Interna­ tional's General Council, Peter Fox, was to help Marx find a publisher.
However, this matter was not settled due to Fox's death in 1869.
The English translation of the first volume of Capital, edited by Engels, did not appear until after Marx's death, in January 1887, and was published by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey & Co.
, London.
The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886.
Eleanor Marx-Aveling took part in the preparatory work for the edition (see also this volume, pp.

He intended to use this material for the section on ground rent in Book III of Capital.
However, this plan did not materi­ alise (see Engels' Preface to Volume III of Capital, present edition, Vol.
37).
— 29, 88 58 The reference is to Marx's economic manuscripts: 1) Outlines of the Critique of Politi­ cal Economy (Rough Draft of 1857-58), and 2) the Manuscripts of 1861-63, which Marx entitled A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (see present edition, Vols.
28-29 and 30-34).
—29 59 The first volume of Capital was translated into French in full by Joseph Roy and appeared in Paris in 1872-75 as individual instalments which were then put to­ gether to form a book.
Marx gave an assessment of the translation and the work which had been done in connection with it in the Preface and Afterword to the French edition (see present edition, Vol.
35) and also in his letter to Nikolai Daniel-son of 28 May 1872 (present edition, Vol.
44).
The changes and additions which Engels made to the third German edition of Volume I of Capital (1883) on the basis of the French edition were pointed out by him in the Preface to the said edi­ tion (see present edition, Vol.
35).
—29, 33, 41, 42, 385 60 The reference is to Marx's and Engels' joint work on the manuscript of The German Ideology and to Engels' work The True Socialists (see present edition, Vol.
5) between 1845 and 1847.
Not long before his death Engels dictated to Eduard Bernstein a list of manuscripts from his own and Marx's literary legacy and of other materials stored in his archives.
The list contained the following note, '.

— 34 64 Following the assassination of Alexander II by members of the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) group on 1 March 1881, liberal reforms were expected in Russia; however, in a manifesto published on 29 April 1881 Alexander III stated that he in­ tended to strengthen autocratic rule.
When King Frederick William IV of Prussia ascended the throne in 1840 the Prussian liberal bourgeoisie had hoped he would carry out the constitutional re­ forms promised by his father, Frederick William III.
However, these hopes proved to be unfounded, and the judicial persecution of liberal bourgeois writers and officials was begun as early as 1841.
— 34 65 In the 1870s and 1880s the French government pursued an active colonialist policy: in 1876 Franco-British financial control had been established in Egypt, and inter­ ference in the country's internal affairs continued until 1882, in 1881-83 a French protectorate was established in Tunisia.
In 1882 came the provocation of an armed conflict in Madagascar and the beginning of a colonial war in North Vietnam (Tongking) which grew to become a war with China and led to the setting up of a French protectorate in Vietnam in June 1884.
— 34, 57 66 Here Engels quotes a thesis from the Programme of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany adopted at the Gotha Congress in 1875 (sec Note 45).
It read, 'The eman­ cipation of labour must be the work of the working class, in relation to which all other classes are only one reactionary mass.
' For comment of this thesis see Marx's Cri­ tique of the Gotha Programme (present edition, Vol.
24, p.
88).
— 35 6' The reference is to the 'local (lesser) state of siege' envisaged by paragraph 28 of the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37); in certain districts and places, usually centres of the labour movement, a state of siege was introduced, as a rule, for a year.
Dur­ ing this period meetings were allowed only with police permission, the distribution of printed material in public places was prohibited and persons considered politically unreliable were expelled from the places concerned.
However, the implementation of these measures led to a growth in the influence of the Socialist Workers' Par­ ty and increased activity on the part of the workers' and Social-Democratic move­ ment in parts of Germany that were well awav from its traditional centres.
— 35, 81, 98 68 Engels is referring to the English Revolution in the 17 th century and the French Revolution of 1789.
Between 1642 and 1646 England witnessed its first civil war which ended in the defeat of the monarchy and the victory of Parliament relying on the support of the big, middle and petty bourgeoisie and the new nobility.
The years 1789 to 1793 cover the three periods of the French revolution when power was transferred from the hands of the big bourgeoisie and the liberal nobility (Feuillants) to the commercial, industrial and landowning bourgeoisie (Girondists) and finally to the Jacobins who expressed the interests of the revolu­ tionary-democratic petty bourgeoisie that had allied themselves with the peasantry and the lower urban strata.
— 35 69 Engels is referring to Volume II of The German Ideology (present edition, Vol.
5; see also Note 60).
—37, 38 70 On 12 June 1883 Pasquale Martignetti wrote to tell Engels that he had read his work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific and intended to publicise it in Italy.
With this in mind, Martignetti made an Italian translation from the French one by Paul La­ fargue and sent it to Engels for the latter to look through.
Apart from minor inser­ tions, Engels made major additions to the text which had not featured in the French version.
— 37 7 ' On 20 June 1883 Laura Lafargue wrote to Engels reminding him that, during her stay with Marx at the Swiss spa town of Vevey in August-September 1882 he had informed her of his plans for future work and promised to give her all the docu­ ments and papers she required to write a history of the International Working Men's Association.
He further requested her to start work on an English translation of the first volume of Capital.
— 39 72 As he was sorting through Marx's literary legacy, Engels found a number of works relating to Marx's preoccupation with mathematics.
Marx's interest in mathemat­ ics had emerged in the early 1850s and had grown as he worked on Capital (see Marx's letter to Engels of 11 January 1858, present edition, Vol.
40).
The first signs of Marx's mathematical endeavours date back to 1846 and are to be found in his ini­ tial notebooks on political economy.
In the 1850s and 1860s this work was ôf an auxi­ liary nature and connected with his studies of political economy, but in the latter half of the 1870s it became systematic and more independent.
Marx's most com­ plete mathematical manuscripts were first published in full in the language of the original (German) with a parallel Russian translation in: K.
Maptcc, MameMamu-uecKue pyKonucu, Nauka, Moscow, 1968 (see Note 79).
—39 73 In his article 'On the Death of Karl Marx' carried by Der Sozialdemokrat in May 1883 (see present edition, Vol.
24, p.
476) Engels announced that Marx's works would be published by his literary executors, Marx's youngest daughter Eleanor and Engels himself.
— 39 74 Louise Michel, a French revolutionary and participant in the Paris Commune, was sentenced in June 1883 to six years' imprisonment and ten years' stringent police surveillance for taking part in a Paris unemployed demonstration in March 1883.
She was amnestied in January 1886.

-42 77 Engels learned from Adolf Hepner, editor of the New-Yorker Volkszeitung, that an English translation of the Manifesto of the Communist Party was being prepared in the United States.
On 7-12 May 1883 Hepner wrote to Engels, 'The Mostians and Schewitsch, i.

' —42 78 The Manifesto of the Communist Party appeared twice in Russian in Geneva: in 1869, it was published by the Volnaya russkaya tipografiya publishing house and issued for a second time in 1882.
It is not quite certain whether the first translation was by Mikhail Bakunin or Nikolai Lyubavin.
The second Russian edition, supplied with a preface specially written by Marx and Engels (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
425-26), was prepared by Georgi Plekhanov and appeared in the Russian So­ cial-Revolutionary Library series.
— 42, 89 7 9 This apparently refers to Marx's mathematical manuscripts which he sent to Engels in 1881 ('Über den Begriff der Abgeleiteten Funktion' and 'Über das Differential') (see Engels' letters to Marx of 18 August 1881 and 21 November 1882, present edi­ tion, Vol.
46; see also Note 72).
— 43 80 From the late 1860s Marx studied agrarian relations in the United States, Belgium and Russia in the intention of using this material in the third book (Volume II) of Capital when examining the emergence of ground rent.
It is clear from Marx's cor­ respondence that he obtained some of the materials he used on agrarian relations in the United States from his friends there (see Marx's letters to Sigfrid Meyer of 4 July and 14 September 1868, and to George Julian Harney of 21 January 1871; present edition, Vols.
43 and 44).
On Marx's notes from Russian sources see Note 57.
— 43, 88, 264 81 Following the appearance in 1875 of the French edition of Volume I of Capital (see Note 59), the French socialist Gabriel Deville considered issuing a short conspectus of this work (see Marx's letter to Deville of 23 January 1877, present edition, Vol.
45).
On 2 August 1882 he met Marx in Paris where the latter looked through part of his manuscript.
On 10 August 1883 Deville wrote to Engels that Paul Lafargue had told him he (Engels) was willing to read the rest of the work.
He sent Engels the manuscript with the request that he make the necessary corrections.
Deville's book was published that year under the title Le Capital de Karl Marx.
Résumé et accom­ pagné d'un aperçu sur le socialisme scientifique.
In the Preface the author wrote that he had done the work 'at the courteous request and benevolent encouragement of Karl Marx'.
Deville sent Engels a copy with his own dedication.
For Engels' assessment of the book see this volume, pp.

-44, 50, 52, 59, 61, 63, 94, 112, 385 82 Between 17 August and 14 September 1883 Engels was on holiday in Eastbourne on the south coast of England.
— 44, 45, 47, 50, 58 83 Engels is referring to his previous stay in Eastbourne from 5 to 27 August 1879.

— 46 85 In his letter of 10 August 1883 Wilhelm Liebknecht asked Engels to let him have the exact dates of death of Marx's wife and eldest daughter.
He further enquired about Heinrich Heine's links with the Paris Vorwärts! as well as Marx's cooperation with the same newspaper and the Deutsche-Brüsseler-^eitung.
Liebknecht intended to use this information in his article 'Karl Marx' which was later published in Die Neue Z«t, N°-'0, 1883.
—47 86 It is clear from Heinrich Heine's letter to Marx of 21 September 1844 that on the same day he also sent Marx some of the proofs of his book Neue Gedichte.
It included the poem 'Deutschland.
Ein Wintermärchen', which Heine intended to publish as a separate edition.
He further requested Marx to write an introduction to this poem to appear in Vorwärts! In October 1844 the newspaper started to publish the poem, preceded by an editorial article probably written by Karl Ludwig Bernays.
— 47 87 In a letter to Engels of 25 June 1883 Pasquale Martignetti thanked the recipient for endorsing his Italian translation of Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (see Note 70).
Expressing his regret that he had not been able to translate from the German origi­ nal, Martignetti asked Engels to advise him of a textbook which might help him to learn German; he also requested Engels to let him know where he might find works by Marx, Engels and other authors which the recipient could recommend as read­ ing material.
On 30 July Martignetti informed Engels that, as the latter had re­ quested (see this volume, p.
37), he was sending him copies of the Italian translation of die above-mentioned work by Engels which had just appeared in Benevento.

— 51 92 On 4 September 1870 in Paris, following the routing of the French army by Prus­ sian forces at Sedan, a mass revolutionary uprising took place which led to the fall of the Second Empire and the proclamation of the Third Republic headed by a bourgeois government (see K.

—51, 324 93 The Party of Progress {Fortschrittspartei) — a bourgeois-liberal party formed in Prussia in 1861.
It represented the interests of the petty bourgeoisie and the section of the middle bourgeoisie that was involved in foreign trade.
The party supported the idea of German unification under Prussian supremacy but demanded the establishment of a parliamentary system.
In 1866 its Right wing split away to form the National Liberal Party.
In 1884 the men of Progress merged with the Left wing which had broken away from the National Liberals to form the German Party of Free Thinkers (Deutsche Freisinnige Partei).

— 53 96 The reference is to the second ballot to the Reichstag held on 29June 1883 at which Bebel, obtaining 11,711 votes, gained a victory over the candidate from the Party of Progress (see Note 93) who received 11,608 votes.
In this way he became the thir­ teenth Social-Democratic deputy to the Reichstag (see Note 43).

On 12 July 1883 an agreement on trade and shipping was signed between Germany and Spain.
In August 1883 talks were held on Romania's accession to the Triple Alliance (made up of Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy); the talks ended with the conclusion of a defensive alliance between Romania and Austria-Hungary which reinforced Romania's subordination to the Triple Alliance.
— 53 99 Democratic Federation — an association of various British workers' and radical-democratic societies formed on 8 June 1881 by a group of radical intellectuals head­ ed by Henry Mayers Hyndman.
The Federation's programme was limited to bour­ geois-democratic demands like adult suffrage, the nationalisation of land and a par­ liamentary reform.
However, as it was joined by socialist intellectuals (Ernest Bel-fort Bax, William Morris and others) and advanced workers (Harry Quelch, John Elliot Burns), the leadership of the Federation adopted noticeably more socialist positions.
The Federation's conference in June 1883 adopted a Manifesto drawn up by Hyndman and setting out its fundamental principles.
It was soon put out as a se­ parate pamphlet entitled Socialism Made Plain, being the Social and Political Manifesto of the Democratic Federation.
It contained a demand for 'nationalisation of the means of production and distribution'.
In August 1884 the Democratic Federation became the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300).
— 54, 106, 114, 118, 123, 165 100 In 1881 Henry Mayers Hyndman published the pamphlet England for All which he intended to serve as a commentary on the programme of the Democratic Federation (see Note 99).
In two of its chapters Hyndman gave an interpretation of several sections of Volume I of Capital, in many cases failing to correctly express their content and referring neither to the author nor the book itself.
Marx ex­ pressed his resolute protest at this in a letter to Hyndman of 2 July 1881 (see present edition, Vol.
46).
— 54, 114 101 The reference is to the Chartist movement in England, the first mass political and rev­ olutionary movement of the English proletariat in the 1830s and 1840s.
Its slogan was the struggle for a 'People's Charter'.
This document contained six points: uni­ versal suffrage (for men of 21 and over), annual Parliaments, vote by ballot, equal electoral districts, abolition of the property qualification for MPs, and payment of MPs.
Petitions urging the adoption of the People's Charter were turned down by Parliament in 1839, 1842 and 1848.
—54, 422 102 The reference is to a series of concessions the British bourgeoisie made to the work­ ing class in the 1870s.
In 1871 the Liberal government under Gladstone adopted the Trade Union Act which improved the judicial status of the unions.
Trade un­ ions were thus recognised for the first time, it was no longer possible to proclaim them illegal, they were able to register their rules and determine their internal structure and procedure of their activities without interference from the judiciary.
In 1875 Disraeli's Conservative cabinet enacted legislation permitting 'peaceful picketing', thus giving the workers a right to strike.
1867 saw the second electoral reform in England under which the property re­ quirement for voters in the counties was reduced to £12 in rent for tenants, whilst in the towns the right to vote was accorded to homeowners and tenants of flats and houses who had lived in the same place for not less than a year and paid rent of not less than £10.
Some of the skilled workers also received the right to vote.
However, this law did not extend to Scotland or Ireland.

— 55 104 In his letter of 14 September 1883 Karl Kautsky sent Engels a leaflet apparently put out by Bruno Geiser and other adherents of the opportunist wing of the Ger­ man Social Democrats.
Kautsky wrote to Engels that the leaflet was a clear dem­ onstration of how, against the background of the Anti-Socialist Law, petty bour­ geois elements in the party were advancing not socialist, but petty bourgeois, slo­ gans (the right to work and demand for a minimum wage); in order to counteract this, Kautsky suggested to Engels that he should without delay write a piece for Der Sozialdemokral explaining that it was impossible to implement the demand for a 'right to work' under capitalist conditions.
— 55 105 The reference is to a series of articles by Karl Kautsky entitled 'Die Entstehung der Ehe und Familie' and carried by the magazine Kosmos, Stuttgart, Vol.
XII (Octo­ ber 1882-March 1883).
Engels set out his opinion of the initial articles in his let­ ters to Kautsky of 10 February and 2 March 1883 (see present edition, Vol.
46).
— 56 106 The reference is to the attempt to annex Port Moresby in New Guinea staged by the British colonial authorities in Queensland, Australia, in April 1883; in Novem­ ber 1884 the British government proclaimed a temporary protectorate over the South-Eastern part of New Guinea and the adjacent island.
— 57 107 The regular trade union congress was held in Nottingham from 10 to 15 Septem­ ber 1883.
—57 108 This is an allusion to a series of articles headed 'Die Trades Unions' which Wil­ helm Liebknecht published anonymously in Die Neue £eit in early 1883.
— 57 109 In the first three issues of Die Neue ^eil for 1883 the Austrian economist Emanuel Hans Sax (pseudonym Fritz Denhardt) published two reviews and a short article entitled 'Zur sozialen Statistik in Deutschland'.
Replying to Engels, Kautsky wrote on 3 October 1883, 'Other contributors I had been counting on are holding back out of cowardice.
I can only ascribe it to this that Braun and Fritz Denhardt have ceased to deliver material.
I am becom­ ing increasingly distrustful of the "educated" socialists who have not broken with the past.
'—57 1 ' ° Intending to become a factory inspector, Victor Adler took a trip around Ger­ many, Switzerland and Britain in 1883 to familiarise himself with the work of the inspectors there.
In Stuttgart he visited Kautsky, who gave him a reference for En-gels.

— 59, 211 112 Hermann Lopatin visited Engels on 19 September, several months after fleeing from exile in Vologda (see Note 6).
They met for the second time on 23 September.
On 20 September 1883 Lopatin wrote to Maria Oshanina, telling her about the substance of his first conversation with Engels (see present edition, Vol.

The Possibilists regarded its convocation as the first step towards the formation of a new International in which they would have the leadership.
With this in mind, invitations to the congress were issued only to the British trade unions and the socialist movements in Italy and Spain.
The decision to form an International, like others, did not yield any practical results.
The anti-Broussists were opponents of the Possibilists.
— 64, 96 116 In early November 1883 Vera Zasulich asked Engels a number of questions with a view to ascertaining his attitude to the plans to publish the second volume of Marx's Capital in Russian in St Petersburg.
She informed him that, if they were given the opportunity, Russian socialist émigrés were prepared to take on the translation.
Together with the letter Zasulich sent Engels the announcement about the publication of the Library of Contemporary Socialism series (see Note 124) and the Russian translation of Marx's Wage Labour and Capital which had just ap­ peared in Geneva.
She further informed Engels that his work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, which she had translated into Russian, was in the press.
This book ap­ peared in Geneva in 1884 under the title Pa3eumie naymaeo cou,iaRU3Ma.

Before leaving for Russia at the end of the year he translated the second, third and beginning of the fourth chapter of the first German edition of Volume I of Capital.
The transla­ tion in full was done by October 1871 by Nikolai Danielson and Nikolai Lyuba-vin, Professor of Chemistry at Moscow University.
The first Russian edition of Volume I of Capital appeared in St Petersburg in 1872.
The second volume of Capital was published in Russian in Danielson's transla­ tion in January 1886.
— 65 1 'B The reference is to the German translation of Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy.
An­ swer to the 'Philosophy of Poverty' by M.
Proudhon which was written in French and appeared in Brussels and Paris in 1847.
The translation into German was begun by Eduard Bernstein who was later joined by Karl Kautsky.
Engels edited the trans­ lation, wrote a special preface for it and a number of notes, using the amendments made by Marx on a copy of the French edition of 1847.
The book was published by Dietz in Stuttgart in January 1885.

— 67 120 Engels is referring to Georgi Plekhanov's translation of the Manifesto of the Commu­ nist Party by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels which appeared in 1882 (see Note 78) and also to Marx's Wage Labour and Capital which was published in Russian in Geneva in the autumn of 1883 as the fourth book in the Russian Social-Revolutionary Library.
The cover carried the note 'translation from the German edition of 1880 (Breslau)'.
— 67 '2 ' Engels wrote the essay 'The Mark' between mid-September and the first half of December 1882 as an appendix to the German edition of his work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (see present edition, Vol.
24).
'The Mark' was published by Der Sozialdemokrat in March-April 1883 and as a separate edition in Hottingen-Zurich under the title Der deutsche Bauer.
Was war er? Was ist er? Was könnte er sein? which was specially prepared by Engels for propaganda work among the peasants.
—68 122 On 10 November 1883 Eduard Bernstein informed Engels of his intention to pub­ lish in Der Sozialdemokrat Paul Lafargue' s pamphlet Le Droit à la Paresse which Lafargue had prepared for publication as a separate edition in the summer of 1883, during his imprisonment in Ste-Pelagie (see Note 9).
The pamphlet Le Droit à la Paresse.
Refutation du 'Droit au Travail' de 1848 was published for the first time in 1880, in l'Egalité; a separate pamphlet appeared the same year in Paris.
This was also published in German in Der Sozialdemokrat under the heading 'Das Recht auf Faulheit' in December 1883-January 1884.
— 68, 86 123 Wallers (Heuler) — the name the republican democrats in Germany in 1848-49 applied to the moderate constitutionalists; here Engels uses the label to describe adherents of the Right wing of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.
— 68, 125, 140, 145 124 Engels is quoting from the announcement of the publication of the Library of Con­ temporary Socialism series issued by Russian Social-Democratic emigres in Ge­ neva on 25 September 1883.
The announcement set out the main aims and tasks of the first Russian Marxist organisation, the Emancipation of Labour group.
It read in part, 'In now changing their programme to serve their struggle against abso­ lutism and the organisation of the Russian working class in a separate party with a definite socio-political programme, the former members of the Black Redistribu­ tion group hereby form a new group — Emancipation of Labour — and defini­ tively break with the old anarchist tendencies'.
The group regarded the following as its main tasks: 1 ) the translation into Russian and dissemination of the major works of K.
Marx and F.
Engels and their followers; 2) a critique of the Narodniks and ef­ forts to deal with current problems of Russian life.

On 28 November, he attended Engels' birthday party together with Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling.
— 68, 80 126 In his letter of 26 November 1883 Johann Philipp Becker asked Engels to remind Laura Lafargue that she had promised, in the presence and with the agreement of Marx, to send him the letters of 1848 and 1849 which Becker had let Marx have for his work on the pamphlet Herr Vogt — 69, 98, 152, 203, 301 127 In 1849 Engels and Johann Philipp Becker took part in the Baden-Palatinate up­ rising (see Engels' 'The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution', present edition, Vol.

C—70 129 On 19 December 1883 the Paris newspaper Le Cri du Peuple published an article by Paul Lafargue headed 'L'Assassinat d'O'Donnell'.
It denounced the hostile position adopted by George Shipton, editor of the English trade union newspaper The Labour Standard, to the trial, taking place in London at the time, of Patrick O'Donnell, a member of an Irish secret society.
On 6 May 1882 members of this society had killed Lord Frederic Cavendish, Principal Secretary for Irish Affairs, and his deputy T.
H.
Burke.
The main witness for the prosecution, James Carey, himself one of the murderers, had subsequently been killed by O'Donnell.
Flying in the face of democratic public opinion, The Labour Standard sharply condemned O'Donnell.
—72 130 On 2 December 1883 Wilhelm Ludwig Rosenberg, editor of the Mew Yorker Volks-Zeitung, organ of the Socialist Labor Party of the USA, published an article signed 'von der Mark'.
It alleged that the state was an abstract concept, a 'union of indi­ viduals'.
Responding to this, Eduard Bernstein used the pseudonym 'Leo' when publishing in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
52, 20 December 1883 an article entitled 'Der Sozialismus und der Staat' in which he quoted verbatim Statements Engels had made in Socialism: Utopian and Scientific about the historical role of the state and his assessment of Lassalle's term 'free state' (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
320-21).
Bernstein also stressed that, in contrast to the anarchists, the Marx­ ists suggested beginning not with the abolition of the state, but with the transfer of power to the proletariat.
On 3 January 1884 Rosenberg continued the polemic by publishing another ar­ ticle in the Mew Yorker Volkszeitung with the title 'Herr Leo'.
In it he tried to prove that Engels and Bebel were making a concession to the anarchists and alleged the Marxists believed that, following the withering away of the state, there would ensue a situation marked by an absence of authorities.
— 72, 86, 91 131 Engels is referring to Johann Karl Rodbertus' letter to Rudolf Hermann Meyer of 20 September 1871.

—72 132 In the 'Preface to the 1872 German Edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party' Marx and Engels referred readers to the passage in Marx's work The Civil War in France where, on the strength of the experience gathered by the Paris Commune, he concluded that 'the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made State machinery, and wield it for its own purposes' (see present edition, Vol.
23, p.
175).
—73 133 By way of a reminder the appendix to the Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, which appeared in Georgi Plekhanov's translation in Geneva in 1882 (see Note 78), contained an excerpt from Marx's The Civil War in France.
En-gels is further referring to the 1883 German edition of the Manifesto for which he wrote a special preface (see present edition, Vol.
26); this edition was published without an appendix.
— 74 134 On 21 December 1883 The Times reported that on 10 December 1883, when Tsar Alexander III had been out hunting, the horses had bolted and upturned the sled in which he was sitting.
— 74 135 On 16 December 1883 his chief and secret police inspector Lieutenant-Colonel Georgi Sudeikin was murdered in St Petersburg in the flat of Sergei Degayev (Yablonsky).
The terrorist act was carried out on the decision of the Executive Committee of the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) party which, on pain of his own death, had forced the exposed provocateur Degayev organise the murder.
The Standard, No.
18561, 11 January 1884, reported that the St Petersburg chief of police supposed the murderers were led from Paris by Lavrov and Tikho-mirov.
— 74, 79 136 On 29 December 1883 Karl Kautsky wrote to Engels that the tsarist government had ordered from his father Johann Kautsky's workshop in Prague the scenery which was to capture various moments from the coronation of Alexander III in May 1883; the scenery was to be put on public display in various Russian cities and to be completed by May 1884.
— 76 137 On 29 December 1883 Karl Kautsky informed Engels that he was planning to publish in Germany Gabriel Deville's Le Capital de Karl Marx.
Résumé et accom­ pagné d'un aperçu sur le socialisme scientifique (see Note 81) which had just appeared in Paris.
On Engels' advice, Kautsky decided not simply to publish a translation but wrote a work of his own in accordance with the instructions Engels gave him in this and subsequent letters (see this volume, pp.
101 and 462); Kautsky's work ap­ peared under the title Karl Marx's Oekonomische Lehren.

— 77 140 In a letter to Engels of 7 January 1884 Paul Lafargue wrote about the 'German "goût"' (taste), illustrating it with such examples as pictures for children, toys and artificial flowers.
Lafargue continued that German producers were planning to capture part of the French market from the domestic industrialists and, for this purpose, the goods they exported to France were being supplied with German la­ bels, this serving to indicate that they were more competitive.
— 78 141 In a letter of 31 October 1883 August Bebel asked Engels to find a place in an English family for the daughter of his associé Ferdinand Issleib.
But on the very next day Bebel apologised to Engels for the trouble he had caused him and sent him Iss-leib's urgent request that he return Bebel's letter of 31 October.
Engels' letter to Bebel, written in pencil, has not been found.
— 80 142 Engels is referring to the propaganda in favour of the introduction of the right to work carried on by the Right wing of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (see also Note 104).
—81 143 During trips to England and Ireland in 1882 and 1884 the American economist Henry George gave lectures in which he attempted to prove that the nationalisa­ tion of land was a means of settling social contradictions under the capitalist sys­ tem (see also Note 31).
— 82 144 The Archives of German Social Democracy were established by a decision of the Conference of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany held in Zurich from 19 to 21 August 1882.
They contained manuscripts by figures from the German workers' movement, including Marx and Engels, literature on the history of Germany and the international workers' movement as well as the workers' press.
The archives were originally based in Zurich and the initial documents were collected by Eduard Bernstein.
From April 1883 the archives were run by Hermann Schlüter.
In June 1888, following its move from Switzerland to London, the editorial board of Der Sozialdemokrat also transferred the archives of German Social Democracy to the same place.
They were moved to Berlin following the repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law.

— 84 14' In his letter of 23 January 1884 Ludwik Krzywicki requested Engels' permission to publish the first volume of Marx's Capital in Polish translation.
The translation was the work of Stanislaw Krusihski, Kazimierz Plawinski, Mieczyslaw Brzezinski, Jôsef Siemaszko, Kazimierz Sosnowski, representatives of Polish revolutionary youth, as well as Krzywicki himself, who edited the entire translation.
The first in­ stalment appeared in 1884, the second in 1886 and the third in 1889.
The book was published in full in 1890 in Leipzig, and one copy of this edition was sent to Engels.
— 87 148 Russian books from Marx's library were sent to Pyotr Lavrov on 3 March 1884.
On 7 March he acknowledged their receipt from Engels.
It is not known what hap­ pened to Lavrov's library, including these volumes.
— 88 149 Engels used the manuscript when preparing the third volume of Capital (see present edition, Vol.
37).
— 88 150 In his letter of reply, written on 30 January 1884, Pyotr Lavrov recommended Ka-zimierz Sosnowski to Engels as 'a sincere and devout socialist and an excellent young man'.
Lavrov also expressed his doubts 'as to where this pretty poor group will find enough money to publish something as large as the first volume of Capital in Polish'.
On the translation of the first volume of Capital into Polish, see Note 147.
—89 15 ' The reference is to Marx's article 'On Proudhon' which he wrote on 24 January 1865 at the request of the editorial board of Der Social-Demokrat (see present edi­ tion, Vol.
20).
Engels planned to include it in full in the preface to the second French edition of The Poverty of Philosophy, which Laura Lafargue was preparing at the time.
It appeared in 1896, following Engels' death.
The article by Marx was included in the appendix under the title 'Proudhon jugé par Karl Marx'.
In the German edition of The Poverty, which appeared in Stuttgart in 1885, this article by Marx came after Engels' preface.
— 91, 102, 107, 206 152 The New Yorker Volkszeitung, No.
12, 14 January 1884, carried an article entitled 'Ein paar Muster'.
Its author advised the Social Democrats, particularly the French and the German, to follow the example of the Irish and Russian revolu­ tionaries, who, as he put it, observed unity and displayed agreeability.
In Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
6, 7 February 1884, these views were criticised in an article entitled 'Toleranz, aber keine Indifferenz' (Tolerance, but not indiffe­ rence) .
— 91 153 It is clear from Eduard Bernstein's letter to Engels of 2 February 1884 that the edi­ torial board of Der Sozialdemokrat intended to devote one of the March issues to the memory of Marx.
The article 'Marx and the Neue Rheinische Leitung (1848-49)', which Engels wrote for this issue, was included in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
11, 13 March 1884 (see present edition, Vol.
26).
—92 154 Engels is referring to the events in Vienna where Hlubek and Bloch, two secret po­ lice agents, were killed in December 1883 and January 1884.
The murders were provoked by the government, which attributed them to the anarchists and used this as an excuse to introduce a state of siege in Vienna and its environs as well as adopting legislation against the anarchists which was actually directed against the socialist movement.
Workers' organisations were subjected to police persecution, their leaders deported and their press prohibited.
— 92 155 In his letter of 30 January 1884 Pyotr Lavrov suggested to Engels the idea of pub­ lishing the second volume of Capital in Russia in instalments parallel to it being prepared for the press in Germany.
He drew Engels' attention to the great Russian public interest in this edition.
He also wrote that Hermann Lopatin had come to Paris for a few days and, intending to publish a Russian edition of this volume in St Petersburg, had expressed the hope that Engels would send the proofs of the German edition in preparation to Nikolai Danielson (see also Note 168).
— 93 156 On 30 January 1884 Pyotr Lavrov wrote to Engels about the need to reissue Marx's early works, which had already become a rarity; he further informed En-gels that he had been given the chance to publish in BtcmuuKi Hapoduou Bom the translation of Marx's work The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 (see present edition, Vol.
10) which had been carried in 1850 by the Neue Rheinische Leitung.
Po­ litisch-ökonomische Revue under the title 'Von 1848 bis 1849'.
Lavrov asked Engels for more detailed information about this work.
— 93, 261 15 7 The reference is to the propaganda trip Paul Lafargue, Jules Guesde, Simon Dere-ure and Jean Dormoy made around the northern districts of France in connection with the forthcoming congress of the French Workers' Party in Roubaix (29 March to 7 April 1884) (see Note 195).
On 27 January 1884 Lafargue, Guesde and Dereure addressed a large rally in St Quentin.
On 28 January they spoke in St-Pierre-Calais, not having arrived until ten o'clock in the evening since they had been forced to wait 3'/ 2 hours for a train to Calais.
The meeting had nevertheless passed off successfully, as Lafargue informed Engels on 6 February 1884.
— 94, 96 158 Engels is referring to a series of articles carried on 23 December 1883, 13 January and 3 February 1884 by the London weekly The National Reformer published by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant.
The author of the first and third articles, which appeared in the 'Daybreak' column was Annie Besant, whilst the second was unsigned and published in the 'Crowded Table' column.
— 95 159 From March 1864 to his death Marx lived with his family in North West London, first at 1 Modena Villas (renamed 1 Maitland Park Road in 1868), then in March 1875 they moved to 41 Maitland Park Road.

in Paris between 1790 and 1803.
— 95 161 Blue Books — collected documents of the British Parliament and Foreign Office published since the 17th century.
— 95, 128 162 The reference is probably to the German Workers' Educational Society formed in London in 1840 by Karl Schapper, Johann Moll, Heinrich Bauer, and other mem­ bers of the League of the Just.
Marx and Engels took part in its activities in 1847 and 1849-50.
The name of the society was changed in the following years, and from the 1870s it was called Communist Workers' Educational Society (Kommu­ nistischer Arbeiterbildungsverein).
Soon after the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37), a group of extremist-minded members gained the up­ per hand in the society.
They opposed the tactics employed by the German Social Democrats against the background of the Anti-Socialist Law, came out against a combination of legal and illegal methods of struggle, against the Social Demo­ crats working in Parliament and for individual acts of terrorism.
In March 1880 a considerable number of members left the society and formed their own organisa­ tion retaining the previous name.
The refounded society announced that it in­ tended to act in accord with the principles and tactics of the German Social Demo­ crats.
The remaining members, including the supporters of Most, continued to ad­ here to Leftist views and were active under the same name.
— 95, 119, 210, 263 163 The Cercle international of the fifth arrondissement was a workers' association in Paris belonging to the Federation of the Centre (the Paris association of the Possi-bilists) (see Note 237).
The secretary of the association, Henri Leclère, was one of the Possibilist leaders; it included among its members a number of German and Russian emigres.
— 96 164 It seems likely that the French journalist Paule Mink (Pauline A.
Mçkarska) went on a trip to the South of France, where she engaged in propaganda work.
It is clear from Paul Lafargue's letter to Engels of 10 April 1884 that she later joined La-fargue and Jules Guesde (see Note 157) and visited a number of northern French cities together with them where Lafargue gave a report on the significance of the International Working Men's Association.
— 96 165 The reference is to the second French edition of Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy which was being prepared at that time by Laura Lafargue (see also Note 169).
The preparatory work on this edition was protracted and it did not appear until 1896 (in Paris), after Engels' death.
—97, 104, 111, 115, 124, 133 166 This letter was written by Engels in reply to Nonne's letter of 7 February 1884.
Heinrich Nonne, an emigre from Hanover who was living in Paris and taught for­ eign languages, informed Engels of his plan to set up a kind of international centre in Paris with a view to bringing about a rapprochement between socialists in dif­ ferent countries.
Nonne asked Engels to send him statistical notes and information about events in other countries.
Later, in September 1884, it turned out that Nonne was in the pay of the Prussian police (see Note 303).
— 97 167 On 5 February 1884 Johann Philipp Becker wrote to Engels saying he believed there was a need to broaden the campaign for universal suffrage in Germany and that the masses there were not learning to act in a collective and coordinated man­ ner.
Becker wrote that this campaign was an excellent means of setting the masses in town and country in motion, notably young people between 21 and 25, who were deprived of the right to vote, and also of exposing the bourgeois parties.
— 98 168 Replying on 9 February to Engels' enquiry about the possibility of publishing a Russian translation of the second volume of Capital in Russia (see Note 155), Pyotr Lavrov wrote that the Russian revolutionaries had decided to bring out this translation 'by all means' and that, should it be confiscated, the book would be put out abroad.
The first Russian edition of the second volume of Capital appeared in St Petersburg on 11 January 1886 with a preface by Nikolai Danielson and in his translation.
The year of publication printed on the title page was 1885.
— 100 169 Engels did not write a special preface to the second French edition of The Poverty of Philosophy.
This led Laura Lafargue to include in the edition Engels' preface to the first German edition of the work ('Marx and Rodbertus') which had appeared in Stuttgart in 1885 (see present edition, Vol.
26).
—101, 104, 124 170 The reference is to Rudolf Meyer's book Der Emancipationskampf des vierten Standes, Vol.
1, Berlin, 1874.
Engels refers to this book in the preface to the second volume of Capital (see present edition, Vol.
36).
— 101 '7 ' The reference is to Marx's manuscript A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1861-63).
Its central part is called Theories of Surplus Value (see present edition, vols 30-34).
Marx planned to revise it and then publish as a separate book of Capital entitled 'The History of the Theory' (see Marx's preface to the first volume of Capital, present edition, Vol.
35).
However, neither Marx nor En-gels carried out this plan.
Engels gave a detailed description of this manuscript in the preface to the second volume of Capital (see present edition, Vol.
36).
Notes Marx gives a critique of Rodbertus' theory of rent in Notebooks X-XI of the Theories (present edition, Vol.
31).
—102, 104, 121, 122, 188, 244, 264, 278 1 '2 The reference is to Karl Kautsky's letter to Engels of 2 February 1884 in which, on behalf of the Volksbuchhandlung in Zurich, he asked for the right to publish a new edition of Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in England.
— 102 173 The 'original cantons' was the name given to Switzerland's mountainous cantons which formed the original core of the Swiss Federation in the 13th and 14th centuries.
— 103 174 When sorting through Marx's manuscripts after his death, Engels discovered a de­ tailed conspectus of Ancient Society or Researches in the Line of Human Progress from Savagery, through Barbarism to Civilization, London, 1877, written by the American sci­ entist Lewis H.
Morgan.
The conspectus had.
been drawn up by Marx in 1880-81 and contained his critical remarks, conclusions of his own and some information from other sources (the conspectus is not included in the present edition).
Believing that Marx had intended to write a work specifically devoted to the initial period in the history of human society, basing himself on Morgan as he did so, Engels, who had familiarised himself with Marx's conspectus and Morgan's book, thought it necessary to carry out Marx's plan.
The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, on which Engels worked from early April to 26 May 1884, appeared in Zu­ rich at the end of the same year.
—103, 121, 123, 131, 132, 135 175 Engels' critical remarks about Taylor's and Lubbock's works are contained in his preface to the fourth German edition of The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State which appeared in 1891 (see present edition, Vol.
27).
— 103 176 By 'later versions' Engels means the manuscripts of the first (1867) and third (1865) volumes of Capital.
— 104 177 In his capacity as a representative of the German Social Democrats, Eduard Bern­ stein visited Lyons and Rouen in February 1884; he gave a speech at the German Workers' Club in Paris.
From 25 February to 2 March Bernstein stayed with En-gels in London, whereupon he returned to Zurich.
— 104, 109 17 8 This letter by Engels was written in reply to John Darbyshire's letter of 17 Febru­ ary 1884.
Reminding Engels of their meeting in 1872, Darbyshire informed him of his efforts to 'start the International again' and continued by saying that in Man­ chester he had 'at last succeeded in forming a Committee of English, Irish, Welsh and Scotch'.
Darbyshire asked Engels to remind him of the names of members of the International so that he might resume correspondence with them and further promised to send him a copy of the 'Principles, Objects and Aims' of the future or­ ganisation.
—106 17 9 The reference is to the cycle of lectures Paul Lafargue and Gabriel Deville gave ('Cours d'économie sociale') on Marx's doctrine which were organised on Sundays from 23 January 1884 by a circle at the Socialist Library of the French Workers' Party.
The cycle of lectures given by Lafargue was called 'Le Matérialisme éco­ nomique de Karl Marx'.
He entitled his second lecture 'Le Milieu naturel.
Théorie darwinienne'.
Deville called his cycle of lectures 'L'Évolution du capital'.
There were five in all, entitled 'Genèse du capital', 'Formation du prolétariat', 'Coopéra­ tion et manufacture', 'Machinisme et grande industrie' and 'Fin du capital'.
Th' lectures were published in the press and also as separate pamphlets in 1884.
Referring to 'bon dieu', Engels means the disproof of the idealist world view as developed by Lafargue in his first lecture 'Idéalisme et matérialisme dans l'histoire'.
— 107, 115, 134, 143, 162, 368, 465 10 The reference is to the second congress of the League of Peace and Freedom — a bour­ geois pacifist organisation formed in Switzerland in 1867 with the active involve­ ment of Victor Hugo, Giuseppe Garibaldi and other democrats.
Mikhail Bakunin took part in its work in 1867 and 1868.
At the League's second congress, which took place in Berne on 21-25 September 1868, he proposed a resolution proclaim­ ing the need for the economic and social equalisation of classes.
Having failed to win the support of the congress, which voted by a majority against his resolution, Bakunin and his supporters left the League.
—108 " Engels is referring to the declaration of 21 March 1871 ('République Française.
Liberté, égalité, fraternité.
.
.
') which Benoît Malon signed as assistant to the Mayor of the 17th arrondissement in Paris together with the Mayor himself and two other assistants.
The document stated that, since the Mayor and his assistants were alienated from power by force, the validity of all acts of the municipality of the 17th arrondissement ceased from that day.
On Malon's activities in this period see also Marx's and Engels' Fictitious Splits in the International (present edition, Vol.

6).
She also asked Engels to send her the text of the preface which he intended to write for the first German edition then in preparation (see Note 118) and expressed the hope that he would look through the proofs of the Russian edition and, if need be, make his remarks.
The Russian edition of The Poverty of Philosophy appeared in Geneva in 1886 in the fifth issue of the Library of Contemporary Socialism se­ ries.
—Ill, 432 6 The 'reactionary socialists' was the name Engels gave to the armchair socialists (see Note 54) who spread the 'myth about Rodbertus' in their works.
For a cri­ tique of them see Engels' preface to the second volume of Capital (present edition, Vol.
36).
—Ill 7 This false accusation against Marx is contained in Johann Karl Rodbertus' letters to Rudolf Meyer of 29 November 1871 (in Briefe und socialpolitische Aufsaetze von Dr Rodbertus-Jagetzow.
Published by Dr R.
Meyer, Vol.
1, Berlin, [1882], p.
134), and to J.
Zeller of 14 March 1875 (in Zeitschrift für die gesammle Staatswissenschaft, Vol.
35, Tübingen, 1879, p.
219).
Engels rebuffed Rodbertus' accusation in the preface to the first German edition of Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy ('Marx and Rodbertus', present edition, Vol.
26) and also in the preface to the second volume of Marx's Capital (present edition, Vol.
36).
— 111, 166, 187 188 After the assassination of Emperor Alexander II on 1 March 1881, Alexander III, his successor, was staying in Gatchina (the Russian tsars' country residence), fear­ ing that new terrorist acts would be staged by the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will).
—112, 280 189 Engels is probably referring to the terrorist activities of the members of the Narod­ naya Volya (People's Will), a secret revolutionary Narodnik organisation, which continued even after 1 March 1881 (see previous note).
—112 190 Engels is referring to the letter Marx wrote in the autumn of 1877 to the editorial board of the St Petersburg magazine Otechestvenniye zapiski (see present edition, Vol.
24, p.
196).
In an effort to have it published in the Russian press after Marx's death, Engels made three handwritten copies of the letter.
The first he gave in Sep­ tember 1883 to Hermann Lopatin, who was in London at the time (see this vo­ lume, p.
59), and the second he sent to Vera Zasulich, that being the subject of this letter.
He seems to have made the third copy in connection with Nikolai Da-nielson's unsuccessful attempt in the autumn of 1885 to have Marx's letter pub­ lished in the journal Severny vestnik (see this volume, pp.
322 and 347).
A Russian translation of Marx's letter was first published in Russia in 1885 in the form of a lithograph; the translation was most likely the work of Vera Zasulich.
A large part of the edition was confiscated by the police, a fate it shared with ano­ ther illegal hectographic version of the letter which appeared that December in St Petersburg.
Marx's letter was first published in Russian abroad in Geneva in BumnuKb Ha-podHoü Bojiu, No.
5, 1886.
The following year it appeared in German in the Ameri­ can newspaper New-Yorker Volkszeitung (3 May) and Der Sozialdemokrat (Zurich, 3 June).

— 113 192 In the 1880 general election Henry Mayers Hyndman stood as an independent candidate for Marylebone constituency.
However, his extremely moderate pro­ gramme (he did not support the demand for the nationalisation of land and op­ posed universal suffrage) lost him votes among the workers and provided Gladstone, who was registered as a voter in the said constituency, with the occasion to de­ nounce him as a Tory.
Hyndman's attempt to be elected to Parliament failed.
— 114 193 On 10 February 1884 Friedrich Adolph Sorge informed Engels that George Stie-beling was about to criticise Marx's concept of history.
— 114 194 The reference is to the regular elections to the German Reichstag which took place on 28 October 1884.
—114, 150, 152, 185, 192, 198, 201 195 The congress of the French Workers' Party met in Roubaix from 29 March to 7 April 1884.
It was attended by 26 delegates representing about 60 groups, circles and trade unions.
The delegates unanimously endorsed the programme adopted at Le Havre in 1880 (see also Note 201).
Also present at the congress were Ernest Bel-fort Bax and Harry Quelch, representatives of the Democratic Federation (see Note 99).
An address was read out from the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, proclaiming solidarity between the workers of all countries.
The reply to this ad­ dress adopted at the congress expressed regret that no German delegation was pre-sent and stated that no government measures could destroy the solidarity between the French and German proletariat.

1, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1959.
— 116, 129, 134, 179, 255, 444 197 In his letter to Laura and Paul Lafargue of 21 February 1884 (see this volume, p.
107), Engels asked them to look through his French translation of Marx's 'On Proudhon' (see present edition, Vol.
20).
In this letter Engels examines the correc­ tions they sent him to the translation.
Marx's article was included in the appendix to the second French edition of his work The Poverty of Philosophy (see Note 165).
— 116 198 The reference is to Proudhon's bopk Si les traités de 1815 ont cessé d'exister? Actes du futur congrès, Paris, 1863, in which he opposed a revision of the decisions on Poland taken by the 1815 Vienna Congress.
He also spoke out against support for the Pol­ ish national liberation movement by European democrats and, in so doing, ac­ tually backed up the foreign policy of Russian tsarism.
— 117 199 On 16 March 1884 London witnessed a workers' demonstration in connection with the anniversary of Marx's death and in commemoration of the Day of the Paris Commune.
A meeting was held at Marx's grave in Highgate Cemetery.
— 118 20° Engels is referring to the review of the March issue of To-Day published in Justice, No.
8, 8 March 1884.
The author criticised the publication of Edward Aveling's article 'Christianity and Capitalism' and believed that the views it presented on re­ ligious and atheist issues were well known.
The reviewer also considered Eleanor Marx's article 'Dr Marx and Mr Gladstone's Budget Speech of 1863' to be 'scarce­ ly suited' to appear in the journal.
In it, Eleanor Marx disproved the allegations made by the English economist Sedley Taylor who had accused Marx of citing Gladstone's 1864 budget speech in a distorted way.
This accusation by Taylor was the continuation of the campaign of slander begun back in 1872 which Engels ex­ posed in 1891 in his work In the Case of Brentano Versus Marx (see present edition, Vol.
27).
—118 201 Following the adoption of a programme based on Marxist positions at the 1880 Congress of the French Workers' Party in Le Havre (see K.
Marx, 'Preamble to the Programme of the French Workers' Party', present edition, Vol.
24), the strug­ gle between the Possibilists (see Note 237) and the Guesdists was aggravated; the latter represented the party's revolutionary wing and favoured the revolutionary transformation of society.
The struggle led to a split in the party at its 1882 Con­ gress in St Etienne.
The Guesdists, who were in a minority, gathered together their representatives in Roanne and formed their own party, retaining the previous name.
— 118, 444, 445 202 'Ex-President of Mankind' was the name Marx and Engels gave to Bernhard Becker, who had been President of the General Association of German Workers (Lassalleans).
This was an allusion to Marx's article 'The "President of Mankind'" (see present edition, Vol.
20, pp.
92-96) containing a critique of Becker's activi­ ties.
—119 203 The German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei) appeared in Stuttgart in 1868.
It consisted of democratic elements from the petty and middle bourgeoisie, mainly from the South German states, and thus was also called South German and Swabian.
Opposing the establishment of Prussian hegemony in Germany and ad­ vancing general democratic slogans, the German People's Party at the same time expressed the particularist aspirations of the bourgeoisie in a number of German states.
This was manifested in its campaign against the unification of Germany to become a single centralised democratic republic, in favour of a federal German state and a republican form of government.
From the late 1870s the party took a negative stance on the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37).
In an effort to gain con­ trol of the workers' movement, the party repeatedly came out in favour of joint ac­ tion with the German Social Democrats during the election campaigns to the Reichstag.
The party's permanent leader and the chairman of its parliamentary group from its foundation up to the 1890s was Leopold Sonnemann.
The party ceased to exist in 1910 when it merged with the People's Party of Progress (Fort­ schrittliche Volkspartei).
— 119, 282, 502 204 Engels is probably referring to the part of Karl Kautsky's letter of 12 March 1884 dealing with the English socialist William Morris.
Kautsky wrote that he had in­ correctly understood Eleanor Marx's remark about William Morris and, in one of his articles, had therefore called him a 'Gefühlssozialist' (socialist by feeling).
The offended Morris categorically rejected this opinion.

Davitt, 'The Irish Social Problem' and P.
Lafargue, 'Peasant Proprietary in France'.
The newspaper Justice, No.
11, 29 March 1884, reported that To-Day was about to publish Lafargue's article 'On Peasant Proprietary in France' and described the author as 'perhaps the greatest living authority on the French peasantry'.
— 122 207 The letter referred to by Marx was probably written in the spring of 1882 and has not been found.
Engels quotes Marx's opinion of Richard Wagner in Chapter II of his work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (see present edition, Vol.
26, p.
147).
—124 208 On 7 April 1884 Eduard Bernstein informed Engels that the second and third parts of his work Anti-Diihring ('Political Economy' and 'Socialism', see present edi­ tion, Vol.
25) were almost sold out and that 300 copies remained of the first part ('Philosophy').
He therefore suggested that a new edition of the work be prepared, but this time as a single volume and not in separate parts.
The second German edi­ tion of Anti-Dühring appeared in Zurich at the beginning of December 1885 with additions made by Engels to the second chapter of the third part.
The title page gave the year of publication as 1886.
— 124, 126, 130, 131, 142, 249, 251, 263, 310, 324, 327, 346, 371, 372 209 On 11 October 1880 Heinrich Wilhelm Fabian, a German émigré living in the United States, wrote to Marx and Engels asking them to contribute to a weekly journal called Einheit which he planned to start publishing in an American city on 1 January 1881.
The journal's programme was compiled by Fabian together with Wilhelm Ludwig Rosenberg and sent together with the letter.
On 6 November 1880 Fabian wrote to Marx about V— 1 (on this, see Ch.
XII of the first part of Anti-Dilhring; present edition, Vol.
25, p.
112).
In April 1884 Fabian published in the Freidenker newspaper an article di­ rected against Marx's and Engels' doctrine of the state.
—124, 295 2 ' ° On 22 March 1884, during a reception on the occasion of his birthday for a delega­ tion made up of representatives from the Federal Council, the German Reichstag and Prussian Landtag, Emperor William I (nicknamed Lehmann) of Germany ex­ pressed his displeasure at the Reichstag's decision at the first reading to reject the prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law.
The Emperor made it plain that he re­ garded opposition to this law as opposition to him personally.
—124, 147 21 ' On 7 April 1884 Karl Kautsky informed Engels that on 1 April a legal newspaper called the Berliner Volksblatt had begun to appear in the German capital.
Its first editor-in-chief, Wilhelm Bios, belonged to the Right wing of the Social­ ist Workers' Party.
The members of the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag, including Bios himself, opposed Liebknecht playing any part in the newspaper's publication.
— 124 2 '2 Engels is referring to the decision taken at the congress of the French Workers' Party in Roubaix (see Note 195) to call an international congress in London for spring 1885 to discuss factory law.

—132 2 '5 Apparently Ludwig Kugelmann sent Engels Leibniz' correspondence as pub­ lished in Hanover, first in the journal Zeitschrift des historischen Vereins für Miedersach­ sen for 1881 and 1884 and later as separate offprints from this journal: Leibnizens Briefwechsel mit dem Minister von Bernstorff und andere Leibniz betreffende Briefe und Aktenstücke aus den Jahren 1705-1716, Hanover, 1882, and Briefwechsel zwischen Leib­ niz und der Herzogin Elisabeth Charlotte v.
Orléans in den Jahren 1715 und 1716, Hano­ ver, 1884.
—133 216 At the elections to the Paris municipal council, which were set for 4 May 1884, the French Workers' Party decided to put up its own candidates only in those con-stituences where no candidates were standing from the Possibilists (see Note 237) or from other socialist tendencies.
— 134 2" Paul Lafargue's letter to Engels of 9 May 1884 gives reason to believe that the reference is to Engels' article on Marx's Capital which he (Lafargue) found at home ('Review of Volume One of Capital for The Fortnightly Review', present edition, Vol.
20).
It is clear from Marx's correspondence with Engels that they intended to publish this review in Lafargue's French translation in Le Courier français, the news­ paper of the Left-wing republicans (see Marx to Engels, 1 February 1868, present edition, Vol.
42, p.
532).
However, the article was not published in Marx's and Engels' lifetimes.
—134 2 '8 Engels' work 'Prussian Schnapps in the German Reichstag' (see present edition, Vol.
24) was written in February 1876.
The publication of this work, which ex­ posed the Prussian Junkers, in Der Volksstaat and as a separate offprint caused consternation in government quarters.
— 136 219 Here Engels is apparently referring to several representatives of the Right wing in the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany such as Bruno Geiser, editor of the Stutt­ gart-based Die Neue Welt, and to journalists who were close to this trend, like Karl Frohme, Wilhelm Bios, Louis Viereck, etc.
—136, 145, 153, 160, 169 220 Eugen Richter, one of the leaders of the German Party of Free Thinkers (see Note 231) opposed the schnapps monopoly as lucrative for the Junkers.
—137 221 In a letter of 29 April 1884 Karl Kautsky suggested to Engels that his work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (see present edition, Vol.
26) should be published in Germany at what was, in his opinion, an opportune mo­ ment— during the Reichstag discussion on the prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law.
He believed that on the eve of the elections all parties would have to reckon with the voters' opinion and the government would therefore not risk banning Die Neue £eit and the publication of Engels' work.
— 137 222 On 12 May 1884 the Reichstag voted by a majority of 189 to 157 at the third read­ ing to prolong the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37) until 1886.
—137, 140 223 The Social-Democratic newspaper Süddeutsche Post was banned on 19 May 1884 because of its 'general tendency' and, in particular, for publishing a leader in No.
57 entitled 'Recht auf Arbeit' ('The Right to Work').
Under Paragraph 11 of the Anti-Socialist Law the newspaper was accused of attempting to overthrow the state and social system.
— 137 224 At Engels' request (see this volume, pp.
85 and 95) he was sent the following mate­ rials from the Archives of the German Socialist Workers' Party (see Note 144): 1 ) Rodbertus, Offener Brief an das Comité des Deutschen Arbeitervereins zu Läpzig, Leipzig, 1863, and 2) Der Social-Demokrat, Nos.
16, 17 and 18 of 1, 3 and 5 February 1865 containing Marx's article 'On Proudhon' (see Note 151).
—138, 139 225 Engels is referring to the accusation made by Rodbertus-Jagetzow that in Capital Marx plagiarised his work %ur Erkenntniss unsrer staatswirtschaftlichen Zustände, Neubrandenburg and Friedland, 1842 (see also Note 187 and Engels' Preface to Volume II of Capital, present edition, Vol.
36).
—138, 319 226 Karl Kautsky gave a detailed critical analysis of Rodbertus-Jagetzow's views in 'Das "Capital" von Rodbertus', published in Die Neue £eit, Nos.
8 and 9, August and September 1884 (see also Note 254).
—138 227 The reference is to a group of persons who took part in publishing Rodbertus-Jagetzow's literary legacy, notably his work Das Kapital.
Vierler socialer Brief an von Kirchmann, Berlin, 1884.
This work was published by Theophil Kozak who also wrote an introduction, a preface was written by the German economist Adolph Wagner.
— 138 228 Given the fact that tighter controls on the Swiss-German border were causing diffi­ culties in transporting the printed edition of Der Sozialdemokrat from Zurich to Ger­ many, Eduard Bernstein went to Belgium with a view to organising the rerouting of the newspaper via the Belgian-German border.
— 139 229 The Centre — a political party of German Catholics formed in June 1870; it ex­ pressed the separatist and anti-Prussian tendencies that were widespread in West and South-West Germany (the deputies representing this party had their seats in the centre of the chamber).
The Centre Party united different social sections of the Catholic clergy, landowners, bourgeoisie, sections of the peasantry and, as a rule, occupied an intermediate position, manoeuvring between the parties which supported the government and the Left opposition groups in the Reichstag.
The Centre was in opposition to the Bismarck government from the mid-1870s to the early 1880s but still voted for the measures it took against the workers' and socialist movement.
Engels described the Centre in detail in The Role of Force in History and in 'What Now?' (see present edition, Vol.
26).
— 140, 192, 216, 222, 343, 361 230 The Conservatives expressed the interests of the German Junkers, the aristocracy, the generals, the Lutheran clergy and senior officials.
In the Reichstag they were represented by the German Conservative Party and the Free Conservative Party.
—140, 147, 192 231 The reference is to the German Party of Free Thinkers formed in March 1884 through the merger of the Party of Progress with the Left wing of the National Liberal Party (see notes 93 and 243).
Reflecting the interests of banking and trading capi­ tal, the middle and petty bourgeoisie, in the 1880s it was in opposition to the Bis­ marck government on a number of domestic policy issues and took a hostile stance towards the Social Democrats.
The party fell apart in 1893.
—140, 149, 389 232 During the ballot on the prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law held in the Reichs­ tag on 10 May 1884 (see Note 222) the majority of deputies — including 27 mem­ bers of the German Party of Free Thinkers and 39 deputies of the Centre (see Note 229) —voted in favour of its prolongation.
The total vote in favour was 189, with 157 against.
Fearing a possible dissolution of the Reichstag (see Note 244) and the calling of new elections, the leaderships of the German Party of Free Thinkers and the Centre, by supporting Bismarck's domestic policy, weakened the liberal oppo­ sition to the government.
— 140 233 When the bill to prolong the Anti-Socialist Law was being discussed in the Reichs­ tag on 9 May 1884 Bismarck declared that he recognised the 'right to work'.
On 17 May, the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Leitung, the mouthpiece of the government, de­ clared in its evening edition by way of explanation that Bismarck had meant the use of unemployed labour in workhouses (like those in Britain) or in places of de­ tention.
It was planned to use the unemployed in Germany to carry out.
physically arduous work — repairing the roads, breaking up stones, chopping wood, etc.
— and to pay them in money or food.
— 140, 150 234 Phalanstère — palaces in which, according to the French Utopian socialist, Charles Fourier, members of producer and consumer associations were to live and work in an ideal socialist society.
The ideas which Engels goes on to advocate in this letter were used in an edito­ rial article probably written by Eduard Bernstein and carried by Der Sozialdemok­ rat, No.
22, 29 May 1884 under the heading 'Reklame und Wirklichkeit'.
—141 235 The national workshops (ateliers) were instituted by the Provisional Government immediately after the February revolution of 1848.
By this means the government Notes sought to discredit Louis Blanc's ideas on 'the organisations of labour' in the eyes of the workers and, at the same time, to utilise those employed in the national work­ shops, organised on military lines, against the revolutionary proletariat.
For an assessment of the national workshops, see K.
Marx, The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 (present edition, Vol.
10, p.

— 141 236 Opportunists was the name given in France to the party of moderate bourgeois re­ publicans after its split in 1881 and the formation of a radical party based on the Left wing and headed by Georges Clemenceau.
The reason for this name, introduced in 1877 by the journalist Henri Roche-fort, was the statement by Léon Gambetta, the party's leader, that reforms should be carried out 'at an opportune time'.
— 141, 314, 413, 444 237 Possibilists—followers of a reformist trend in the French socialist movement be­ tween the 1880s and the beginning of the 20th century.
It was led by Paul Louis Marie Brousse and Benoît Malon who caused a split in the French Workers' Party in 1882 by forming their own party called the Workers' Social-Revolutionary Party (see Note 201).
Its ideological basis was the theory of municipal socialism.
The Possibilists proclaimed the 'policy of possibilities' to be their principle; at the beginning of the 20th century they became part of the French Socialist Party.
—141, 320, 425, 442 238 In connection with Wilhelm Liebknecht's trip to Paris in mid-May 1884 German newspapers reported that preparations were underway there for a conference of so­ cialists from several European countries.
—144 239 From 29 May to 4 June 1884 Engels stayed in Hastings with Sigismund Borkheim, a participant in the revolution of 1848-49 in Germany.
— 144, 152, 381 240 On 29 May 1884 Kautsky informed Engels of the differences of opinion which had arisen on the editorial board of Die Neue Zeit between himself and the publisher Jo­ hann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz.
The latter thought it essential to make the journal more up to date by introducing a new column headed 'Politische Rundschau' which, he intended, should be run by Wilhelm Bios in Stuttgart.
Then Dietz insist­ ed on Bios being appointed editor of Die Neue £eit.
This situation prompted Edu­ ard Bernstein, in a letter to Engels of 29 May 1884, to suggest that for the time be­ ing no chapters should appear there from Engels' work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.
— 145, 153 241 The reference is to the 'Programm der sozialistischen Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' adopted at the unification congress in Gotha in May 1875.
On this document see K.
Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme (present edition, Vol.
24).
— 146 242 Engels is referring to the system of provocation, espionage, false evidence and for­ geries employed by the Prussian police officer Wilhelm Stieber, who organised the Cologne trial of members of the Communist League in 1852.
— 147 243 The reference is to the National Liberals, a Prussian, and from 1871 all-German, Right-wing bourgeois party which existed from 1867 to 1918.
It was one of the pil­ lars of the Junker-bourgeois bloc.
The party's programme called for civil equality and bourgeois-democratic freedoms, but as the workers' movement in Germany strengthened it abandoned these demands and contented itself with Bismarck's half-hearted reforms.
Following the unification of Germany it definitively took shape as a party of the big, mainly industrial, bourgeoisie and for all practical purposes disavowed the demands it had made earlier.
— 147, 192, 428, 439 244 On 9 May 1884, during the discussion on the prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37) Bismarck read out to the Reichstag a letter written by William I in March 1884 following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia (see Note 188).
The author referred to the need for joint action by the great powers to combat 'the threat of assassination attempts hanging over the whole of Europe'.
Bismarck then announced his intention to dissolve the Reichstag immediately in the event of the bill being defeated.
— 147 2,5 In late February 1884 a major strike began at the coal mines in Anzin, Denain district, department Nord, France.
Involving more than 10,000 workers, the strike was in protest at the prohibition of trade unions and lasted until mid-April when the employers reversed their decision to introduce harder working conditions.
— 149 246 Under the English Act for the Reliefs of the Poor (43rd Elizabeth) (1601) a special tax was levied in each parish to help the poor.
Those residents who were unable to provide for themselves and their families received help from the poor fund.
An Act for the Amendment and Better Administration of the Laws Relating to the Poor in England and Wales (1834) provided for only one form of assistance to the poor, namely their accommodation in workhouses, otherwise known as 'bastilles for the poor'.
The aim of the act was to force the poor to agree to harder working conditions and, in this way, to provide the industrial bourgeoisie with a more plentiful supply of cheap labour.
— 150 247 The reference is to the Act against the Criminal Use of Explosives.
It was intro­ duced in response to the unsuccessful assassination attempt organised by a provoca­ teur in Niederwald on 27-28 September 1883.
During the discussion of the bill in May 1884 the Social-Democratic deputies announced their refusal to discuss or vote on it.
The act was passed by the Reichstag on 15 May 1884 and subjected to police surveillance the production, use, storage and import of explosive substances.
Violations of the act were punished by long terms of imprisonment or even the death sentence.
— 150 248 Sigismund Ludwig Borkheim's autobiography was published posthumously in Die Neue %eil, Nos.
3, 5, 6 and 7 for 1890 under the heading 'Erinnerungen eines deutschen Achtungvierzigers'.

He in­ formed Engels about the details of this meeting on 23 June 1884.
— 153 251 A number of explosions occurred in London on 30 May 1884, including one at Scotland Yard when a dynamite charge was set off in a public convenience.
Irish nationalists claimed responsibility for the explosions.
— 154 252 An anarchist newspaper called L'Explosion began to appear in Carouge near Ge­ neva in April 1884.
One of the men behind it was the former Bakuninist Carlo Ter-zaghi (see also K.
Marx and F.
Engels, The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men's Association, present edition, Vol.
23).
— 154 253 The reference is to the anarchists who were expelled from Vienna and its surround-Notes ings due to the introduction of a state of siege there on 30 January 1884 (see Note 154).
Some of them emigrated to Britain.
—154 254 On 23 June 1884 Karl Kautsky sent Engels the beginning of his article 'Das "Kapital" von Rodbertus' (see also this volume, p.
138) so that the latter might familiarise himself with its contents.
The article was published in Die Neue £eit, Nos.
8 and 9 for 1884.
It marked the start of Kautsky's polemic with Carl August Schramm (see Engels to Bebel, 20-23 January 1886, this volume, pp.
386-87).
—155 255 The reference is to the work: J.
K.
Rodbertus-Jagetzow, Zur Erkennlniss unsrer staats­ wirtschaftlichen Zustände, Neubrandenburg and Friedland, 1842.
Rodbertus' treat­ ment of the constituted value as referred to in this letter is examined by Engels in the article 'Marx and Rodbertus' which he wrote by way of a preface to the first German edition of Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy (see present edition, Vol.
26).
—156 256 Engels is replying to Evgenia Papritz's letter of 26 June 1884 in which she wrote that, with a view to spreading the ideas of scientific socialism in Russian society, a start had been made in Moscow on publishing the lithographed journal Cou,iajiuc-muuecKoe manie.
The journal was to publish translations of works by West European authors and articles on socio-political issues.
Informing Engels that she was trans­ lating his work Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy (see present edition, Vol.
3), Papritz enquired where she could obtain little-known works by Marx and himself for translation and asked where she might find 'the last manifesto to the English workers' as well as Engels' work Anti-Dühring.

20); in 1883, Marx's Wage Labour and Capital (Vol.
9), and in 1884, Engels' Socialism: Utopian and Scientific.
Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy (see Note 185) appeared in 1886.
The second volume of Capital by Marx was pub­ lished in St Petersburg in 1885 (see Note 155).

The first separate edition of the work appeared in Breslau (Wroclaw),.
Silesia in 1880 with­ out Marx's involvement.
The second edition was published in the same place in 1881.
In 1884, with Engels' participation and a short Introductory Note written by him on the history of its publication (see present edition, Vol.

— 159 259 In his letter of 20 June 1884 Eduard Bernstein asked Engels to send him a photo­ graph of Marx for a chromolithograph a comrade of his was planning.
For the orig­ inal Bernstein wished to have either the drawing in chalk which he had seen at Engels' home in his study, or else a photograph of Marx.
— 159 260 On 20June 1884 Eduard Bernstein wrote to Engels saying that the Zurich publish­ ing house Die Volksbuchhandlung was planning to publish a collection of socialist poetry.
Bernstein enquired in this conjunction about previous editions of verse by Georg Weerth.
Engels is probably referring to the collection of Weerth's poems se­ lected from two previous editions, Jahrbuch für Kunst und Poesie, Barmen, 1843, and Album.
Originalpoesien von Georg Weerth, Borna, 1847.
Moreover, Weerth com­ pleted another collection of poems in 1848, which was not, however, published in his own lifetime.
It was included in Georg Weerth's Sämtliche Werke published in Berlin in 1956-57.
—160 261 Hermann Schlüter, the keeper of the Archives of German Social Democracy (see Note 144) asked Bernstein to remind Engels that he had agreed to send him a number of materials for the archives.
Bernstein did this in his letter to Engels of 20 June 1884, remarking that Schlüter had 'a real mania for collecting things'.

Of the total edition of 5,000 copies, 1,000 would be passed on to the publisher Jakob Schabelitz for distribution in Germany.
— 164, 172 265 In their letters to Engels of 16 July 1884 Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein in­ formed him that the Stuttgart publisher Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz was plan­ ning to cease issuing Die Neue %eil because of financial difficulties.
However, a month later, on 18 August, Kautsky wrote to tell Engels that he and Dietz had discussed plans for moving the journal's place of publication to Hamburg.
This plan was not carried out and Die Neue ^eit continued to appear in Stuttgart up to 1923.

In a note on the report the author severely criticised 'the scholars from the Volkszei-tung and other German papers' for using the word 'bacillum'.
Among others, this note was directed against Bruno Geiser.
Die Neue Well, of which he was the editor, had used the word in its report on the cholera epidemic.
— 166 268 Given the fact that a cholera epidemic was expected in Paris in the summer of 1884, Engels and Paul Lafarguc agreed to persuade Laura Lafargue to move to England for some time.
However, Laura did not arrive at Engels' home until the autumn of 1884.
—167, 171, 224 269 Le quart d'heure de Rabelais — the moment of settling accounts, an unpleasant inter­ lude.
This expression originates from an episode which allegedly happened to the French author Rabelais and was retold by Voltaire.
On his way from Rome to Paris, Rabelais stopped off at a hotel in Lyons and, not having any money to live on, thought up an original way of solving his problem.
With the assistance of the son of the hotel's owner, he made some labels on which he wrote 'Poison to kill the 586 Notes King' and 'Poison to kill the Queen' to be attached to bottles.
After that Rabelais, having now eaten his fill for free, was taken to Paris in the company of two police­ men.

In this letter Engels sets out his remarks on the manuscript of Paul Lafargue's résumé of the book Le Collectivisme.
Examen critique du nouveau socialisme by the French economist and sociologist Paul Leroy-Beaulieu.
Part of the book was devot­ ed to a denial of Marx's economic doctrine, particularly his theory of surplus va-lue.
Taking account of Engels' remarks, Lafargue's article was published in the Journal des Economistes, No.
9, 1884 under the heading 'La théorie de la plus-value de Karl Marx et la critique de M.
Paul Leroy-Beaulieu'.
— 179 i0 Here, the direct form of the circulation of commodities means the form: com­ modity—money—commodity, and the second form: money—commodity— money.
—180 ' ' The editor-in-chief of the Journal des Economistes, Gustave Molinari, assured Paul Lafargue that he would be given the opportunity to make a reply should Paul Le­ roy-Beaulieu raise objections to his résumé (see Note 279), whereupon the discus­ sion would be considered finished.
However, the one to raise objections was not Beaulieu, but Maurice Block, who published an article in the Journal des Economis­ tes entitled 'Le Capital, de Karl Marx, à propos d'une anticritique'.
Lafargue re­ plied to him in the Journal des Economistes, No.
11, 1884, with an article called 'Le "Capital" de Karl Marx et la critique de M.
Block'.

Its supporters, known as Free Traders, advocated freedom of trade and non-interference by government in eco­ nomic life.
The centre of the Free Traders' agitation was Manchester.
Marx dealt in detail with Frédéric Bastiat's views in the Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58 (see present edition, Vol.

—184 4 On 12 August 1884, Marya Jankowska (pseudonym Stefan Leonowicz), the repre­ sentative of a Polish Social-Democratic group in Geneva, wrote to Engels request­ ing permission to publish a Polish edition of his work The Origin of the Family, Pri­ vate Property and the State.
Engels wrote a draft of his reply on the back of the letter from Jankowska.
—185 5 Ina letter of 18 August, 1884 Karl Kautsky suggested to Engels that he should ad­ vertise the forthcoming publication of his work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State and include its preface in Die Neue £eit with a view to prevent­ ing the book being banned in Germany.
The September issue of the journal car­ ried an announcement that this work was to appear shortly together with excerpts from Engels' preface (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
129-276).
—187 6 On 18 August 1884 Eduard Bernstein wrote to inform Engels that translation work had been completed on Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy (see Note 118).
He also offered to compile an index to Capital together with Karl Kautsky.

The address it bears is also in his handwrit­ ing and reads: 'Herrn K.

; Riesbach-Zürich, Switzer­ land.
'— 189, 200, 205 8 In his letter of 26 August 1884 Karl Kautsky drew Engels' attention to the fact that, in his work Rodbertus, der Begründer des wissenschatftlichen Sozialismus, Georg Adler described as mistaken Engels' claim that Rodbertus had borrowed his doc­ trine of crises from Sismondi (see present edition, Vol.
25, p.
273, Engels' foot­ note).

In No.
36, 3 September 1884 there was a leading article called 'Höheres Blech' directed against an article praising Rodbertus by the Austrian journalist Hermann Bahr which had appeared in the Viennese Deutsche Wochenschrift in August.
In the same issue of Der Sozialdemokrat, Eduard Bernstein, using his pseudo­ nym Leo, published an article ('Ein Ketzerriecher') against Heinrich Wilhelm Fabian, a German socialist living in the United States who had published ar­ ticles against Marx's and Engels' doctrine of the state in the April issue of Der Frei­ denker and the New Yorker Volkszeitung.
Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
37, 11 September 1884 carried an article called 'Wie stellen wir uns zur Börsensteuer?' evidently written by Abraham Gumbel.
The article said that the German Social Democrats should support the bill on the stock exchange tax proposed by Bismarck.
Taking up the polemics on this issue, the editorial board of Der Sozialdemokrat declared that, in its opinion, the bill accorded merely with the interests of the big landowners' party (see 'In Sachen der Börsenstcuer', Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
39, 25 September 1884).

241, 30 August 1884 (first edition) carried an article headed 'Professor Schweifurth über den Congo' on the activities of the Association Internationale Africaine which had been founded in Brussels in 1876 by King Leo­ pold II of Belgium.
The organisation was renamed the Comité d'Etudes du Haut-Congo in 1878.
Among those taking part in its work was the famous explorer Henry Morton Stanley.
The actual aim of the association was to seize and exploit the Congo basin.
The article reported that, alongside their philanthropic and sci­ entific work, the Belgian settlers were buying slaves in the Congo, employing the slave labour of the indigenous population, buying ivory, palm oil and other local commodities for export.
— 192 292 German colonial policy became much more active in 1884.
The first congress of the German Colonial Union took place on 5 January in Frankfurt-am-Main.
The same year saw the organisation of the first German trading station on the South-West coast of Africa, which served as a base for expanding the role played by Ger­ man capital in Africa.
— 192, 199 293 The reference is to the manuscripts of Carl Schramm's and Karl Kautsky's arti­ cles.
Engels goes on in the letter to examine the latter's article against Schramm.
The German Social Democrat and reformist Carl Schramm sent the editors of Die Neue £eit his manuscript 'K.
Kautsky und Rodbertus' for publication in which he sharply attacked Kautsky's article 'Das "Kapital" von Rodbertus' which the jour­ nal had published previously.
Schramm's article and Kautsky's reply, entitled 'Eine Replik', were carried by Die Neue J^eit, No.
11, 1884.
— 193 294 The neo-Malthusian Charles Robert Drysdale published an article entitled 'The State Remedy for Poverty' in the September issue of To-Day.
Referring to Karl Kautsky's book Der Einfluss der Volksvermehrung auf den Fortschritt der Gesellschaft (Vienna, 1880), he wrote that the 'ardent Socialist' Kautsky 'fully admits the truth of the generalisation of Malthus and Darwin'.
— 195 295 This letter was written by Engels on a postcard.
On it he wrote the following ad-dress: 'Herrn H.

'—196 297 On 15-17 September 1884, a meeting took place in Skierniewice, Poland, be­ tween the emperors of Germany, Austria and Russia and their foreign ministers.
The result was the prolongation for three years of the agreement reached between Russia and Germany in June 1881 on the maintenance of benevolent neutrality should the other country be attacked.
— 198 298 Engels seems to be referring to the impression the results of the German Reichstag elections of 10 January 1874 had in Europe, when the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany scored a considerable victory: nine of its candidates (including August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht) were elected and the party won over six per cent of the poll.
— 198 299 In 1884 the third parliamentary reform was carried out in England, as a result of which the suffrage was extended to include small farmers and the farm workers who were homeowners or householders.
Suffrage was not extended to the poorer rural and urban sections of the population (tenants and domestic servants), nor to women.
The first elections under the new electoral law took place in November-December 1885, with the electorate having a numerical strength of two million higher than at the previous poll (see Note 487).
— 198, 270, 304, 314, 317, 318, 320, 341, 497 300 Social Democratic Federation — an English socialist organisation founded in August 1884 and based on the Democratic Federation (see Note 99); it united different so­ cialist elements, mainly drawn from the intelligentsia and part of the politically ac­ tive workers.
The Federation's programme stated that all the wealth should belong to labour — its only source, it called for the socialisation of the means of produc­ tion, distribution and exchange, for the set-up of society of'complete emancipation of labour'.
It was the first socialist programme in England, which was on the main based on Marx's ideas.
The leadership of the Federation was in the hands of Henry Mayers Hyndman, who was prone to use authoritarian methods, and his support­ ers, who denied the need to work in the trade unions.
This doomed the organisa­ tion to isolation from the working masses.
As a counter to Hyndman's line, a group of socialists within the Federation (Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling, Tom Mann, William Morris and others) campaigned for the establishment of close links with the mass workers' movement.
The disagreements in the Federation over ques­ tions of tactics and international cooperation (attitude to the split in the French Workers' Party; see notes 201 and 348) led in December 1884 to a split and the foundation of an independent organisation called the Socialist League (see Note 346).
In 1885-86 the local branches of the Federation took an active part in the un­ employed movement, supported the strike campaign and the fight for an eight-hour working day.

The book included, in place of Marx's preface, his article 'On Proudhon' (see present edition, Vol.
20) and two 590 Notes appendices: an excerpt from Marx's work A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy on the theory of the English socialist John Gray (see present edition, Vol.
29, pp.
320-23), and a translation of the 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade' (Vol.

— 200, 205, 206, 208, 216 302 The Italian translation of Engels' work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State was done by Pasquale Martignetti and edited by Engels himself (see this volume, p.
215).
The Polish edition appeared in Paris in 1885, and the Russian translation was published in St Petersburg in 1894.
— 205, 421 303 In a note headed 'Exécution d'un agent provocateur' the Paris newspaper Le Cri du Peuple, No.

It received 549, 990 votes, or 238,029 more than at the 1881 elections.
—210, 216, 221 307 The election result meant that the Social-Democratic group was able to initiate legislation for the first time, since the Reichstag's rules accorded this right only to parliamentary groups with 15 or more seats.
— 210, 217 308 Bebel was elected to the Reichstag in Hamburg I (12,282 votes) and Dresden I (8,620 votes at the first ballot and 11,106 at the second) constituencies.
He did not receive the required number of votes in Leipzig and Cologne.
— 211 309 The Reichstag elections of 28 October 1884 brought fresh success to the German Social Democrats when compared with the 1878 elections held before the Anti-Socialist Law came into force; their vote increased from 493,000 to 549,900.

Having failed to de­ stroy the Social Democrats in the initial years of this law (see notes 307 and 309), in late 1881 Bismarck set out to achieve his objective through a carrot and stick policy.
On 17 November, a proclamation was published by the Emperor announcing a number of reforms (social insurance laws in cases of industrial accident, illness, old age and invalidity).
Bismarck hoped that their introduction would split the So­ cial Democrats and isolate the working class from the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.

—220, 231, 279 317 As a result of the War of the Austrian Succession ( 1740-48) Frederick II of Prussia seized Silesia from Austria.
Frederick II waged the war against Austria in alliance with France and Bavaria and twice during its course betrayed his allies by con­ cluding a separate peace treaty with Austria (1742 and 1745).
Prussia was among the participants in the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763.
On 5 April 1795 Prussia concluded the separate Peace of Basle with the French Republic, thus betraying its allies in the first anti-French coalition.
— 221 318 German Confederation (der Deutsche Bund) was an ephemeral union of German states formed by decision of the Congress of Vienna in June 1815 and originally comprising 35 absolutist feudal states and four free cities.
The central body of the German Confederation was the Federal Diet, which consisted of representatives of the German states.
The Confederation sealed Germany's political and economic fragmentation and retarded her development.
After the defeat of the revolution of 1848-49 and the failure of the attempts to establish a more stable political union, the German Confederation was restored in its old decentralised and amorphous form.
The German Confederation finally ceased to exist during the Austro-Prussian war of 1866.
This war ended the long-standing rivalry for supremacy in Germany between Austria and Prussia in favour of the latter and marked an important Notes stage in the unification of Germany from above under the hegemony of Junker-bourgeois Prussia.
— 221 3 '9 Engels is referring to the annexation and incorporation into Prussia of the King­ dom of Hanover, the Electorate of Hessc-Kassel, the Duchy of Nassau and the free city of Frankfurt-am-Main.
This occurred after Prussia's victory in the war with Austria, in which they had supported the latter, and were the subject of legislation adopted on 20 September 1866.
—221 320 Engels is apparently referring to the confiscation of the property and lands belong­ ing to George V, the King of Hanover, who had fought on the Austrian side.
This decision was adopted by the Prussian government on 2 March 1868.
— 221 321 The North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) — a federative state formed in 1867 after Prussia's victory in the Austro-Prussian war to replace the disintegrat­ ed German Confederation (see Note 318).
It initially included 19 states and three free cities, which were formally recognised as autonomous.
In 1870 Bavaria, Baden and Württemberg joined the Confederation.
The establishment of the North Ger­ man Confederation and its Constitution securing Prussian domination, was a ma­ jor step towards the national unification of Germany.
The Confederation ceased to exist in January 1871, when the German Empire was formed.
— 221 322 The reference is to the November coup d'état in Prussia which ended on 5 Decem­ ber 1848 in the dispersal of the Prussian National Assembly and the publication of the so-called imposed constitution (see also present edition, Vol.

Müller declared that he and millions more Germans supported the Republic and resolutely defended the Paris Commune.
The text of the leaflet was reprinted in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.

Jules Guesde quoted Müller in the leading article carried by Le Cri du Peuple, No.
387, 18 November 1884, which was headed 'Nouvelle victoire'.
What Engels meant by the Hanoverian programme was the election leaflet is­ sued in Hanover stating that the growth in reaction in Germany could be explained by the cowardice of the National Liberals and their grovelling to Bismarck.

In a letter of 2 December 1884, Karl Kautsky, who was preparing to move from Zurich to London and was to stop off in Vienna and Berlin, gave Engels his Vien­ na address and also asked him to receive his correspondence at his (Engels') Lon­ don address for a start.
Kautsky further inquired whether Engels thought it bet­ ter to publish Marx's 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade' as a separate pamph­ let or as an appendix to the German edition of The Poverty of Philosophy (see Note 301) being printed by Dietz's publishing house in Stuttgart at the time.
— 230 331 The original of this letter contains a number of changes written in an unknown hand, perhaps that of August Bebel.
The present edition reproduces Engels' text and gives the changes in footnotes.
— 231 3 3 2 Speaking on 10 May 1884 in the Reichstag debate on the prolongation of the An ti-Socialist Law (see Note 37), Bruno Geiser stated that the Social Democrats did not seek to use violence to overthrow the existing state and society.
He described Bis­ marck's statement in the Reichstag of 9 May 1884 in which the latter acknowl­ edged the right to work (see Note 233) as evidence of a social revolution in progress.
Speaking in the debate on 12 May 1884, August Bebel declared, in contrast to Geiser, that the law's prolongation would not effect the development and imple­ mentation of socialist ideas and that 'sooner or later they will quite certainly come to play the dominant role in state and society'.
Geiser's and Bebel's speeches were published in a pamphlet entitled Aus den Verhandlungen über die Verlängerung des Sozialistengesetzes which appeared in Nu­ remberg in 1884.
—231 333 The reference is to the five thousand millions of golden francs which France paid under the peace treaty it concluded with Germany on 10 May 1871 in Frankfurt-am-Main after losing the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71.

—234 3 3 5 The reference is to the party of moderate Republicans headed by Armand Marrast which formed around the newspaper Le National in the 1840s; it was supported by the industrial bourgeoisie and a section of the liberal intellectuals connected with it.
— 234 336 The interim government formed on 24 February 1848 during the bourgeois-democratic revolution in France was a coalition of three political groupings: the bourgeois republicans, the petty bourgeois democrats and the petty bourgeois so­ cialists.
The representatives of the two latter groupings made up the 'Social-Democratic minority' — accounting for four of the 11 members of the govern­ ment— and were unable to exert any influence in their own right on government decisions.

—236 339 This evidently refers to the trips to Scotland undertaken by Andreas Scheu (in No­ vember 1884) and Henry Mayers Hyndman (in early December 1884).
In Edin­ burgh Scheu took part in the founding of the Scottish Land and Labour League from among the local socialists.
In an effort to extend the organisation's influence to other Scottish cities, Scheu contacted socialists in Glasgow and called on them to form a branch of this League.
However, a gathering of socialists took place in Glasgow on 1 December at which Hyndman was present and which proclaimed the formation of the Glasgow branch of the Social Democratic Federation.
This was reported in Justice, No.
47, 6 December 1884.
— 237 340 At a meeting of the executive of the Social Democratic Federation chaired by H.

— 239 342 In late 1884, Bismarck, seeking to step up German colonial policy (see Note 292) demanded that the Reichstag approve annual subsidies for steamship companies to organise regular services to Eastern Asia, Australia and Africa.
This demand led to disagreements within the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag.
The Left wing headed by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht came out against support­ ing the government's policy.
The Right-wing majority in the group (Dietz, Frohme, Grillenberger, etc.
) intended to vote for the subsidies under the pretext that they promoted international links.
Under pressure from the majority, the par­ liamentary group decided to declare the subsidies issue to be of no major impor­ tance and give each member the right to vote as they thought fit (see Der Sozialde­ mokrat, No.
50, 11 December 1884).
The sharp criticism expressed in Der Sozialdemokrat and the resolutions adopted by the party leadership led the majority of the parliamentary group to somewhat mo­ dify their attitude to the government's project when it was discussed in the Reichs­ tag in March 1885 and to make their support conditional on the Reichstag accept­ ing a number of the group's proposals.
It was not until after the Reichstag de­ clined to endorse the proposals made by the Social-Democratic group that they vot­ ed against the subsidies.
—239, 240, 242, 245, 268, 295, 388 343 The reference is to the speech made by Max Kayser on 17 May 1879 with the ag­ reement of the entire Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag in support of the government plan to introduce protective customs tariffs.
Marx and Engels sharply condemned Kayser's action in defending a proposal put before the Reichstag in the interest of large industrialists and big farmers and to the detriment of the masses.
They further criticised the lax attitude shown to Kayser by a number of German Social-Democratic leaders (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
259-61).

— 243 345 In a letter of 18 November 1884 Pasquale Martignetti requested Engels' permis­ sion to publish in one volume two works, namely The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State and The Peasant War in Germany, the former of which he was translating into Italian at the time.
— 243 346 The reference is to the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300) and the So­ cialist League.
The Socialist League was formed in December 1884 by a group of English social­ ists who had left the Social Democratic Federation.
Its organisers included Elea­ nor Marx, Ernest Belfort Bax, William Morris and others.
'The Manifesto of the Socialist League' (see The Commonweal, No.
1, February 1885) proclaimed that its members advocate 'the principles of Revolutionary International Socialism' and '.
.
.
seek a change in the basis of Society .
.
.
which would destroy the distinctions of classes and nationalities'.
The League set itself the task of establishing a national workers' party adhering to international stand, assisting the trade union and co­ operative movements.
In its initial years the League and its officials took an active part in the workers' movement.
However, in 1887 the League's leadership split into three factions (anarchist elements, the 'parliamentarians' and the 'antiparlia-mentarians'); its links with the day-to-day struggles of the English workers were gradually weakened and there was a growth in sectarianism.
In 1889-90 the League fell apart.

4, 24 January 1885 (New York) in the column 'Sozial-politische Nachrichten der letzten Tage'.
An editorial note placed before the fragment read as follows: 'In a communication from London of 31 De­ cember 1884, Fred.
Engels tells us that Volume II of Marx's Capital, so long and eagerly awaited, is now ready to go to press, and likewise gives us the glad tidings that, exceeding all our expectations, the third and fourth volumes are also to be bestowed upon us.
' The whereabouts of the original letter is not known.
— 246 348 The reference is to the rapprochement between the leadership of the Social Demo­ cratic Federation and the French Possibilists (see notes 300 and 237).
On 27 December 1884 the newspaper Justice, No.
50 published a letter from Adolphe Smith under the heading 'France and the International Congress'.
The author considered it essential that the Social Democratic Federation, hav­ ing proposed the convocation of an international socialist congress, should rec­ ognise the Possibilists as the main organisation of the French socialists and not maintain relations with the French Workers' Party.
— 247 349 The reference is to the manuscript of the English translation of Engels' book The Condition of the Working-Class in England (present edition, Vol.
4) prepared by the American socialist Florence Keliey-Wischnewetzky for publication in the United States (see also Note 360).
—248, 257, 373, 382, 419 350 Engels is referring to the review of the pamphlet G.

— 251 353 Reptiles (grovellers) is a term which became widespread after Bismarck used it in his speech before the Prussian Chamber of Deputies on 30 January 1869 to describe the government's opponents.
The left-wing press took up this expression and began to describe as reptilian the semi-official press which was in the pay of the govern­ ment, labelling the relevant category of journalists as reptiles.
— 253 354 Engels' negative attitude to Franz Mehring which he expresses in this letter had to do with the fact that from the mid-1870s Mehring started to criticise Social-Democratic theory and tactics in the bourgeois-democratic press.
His position was summarised in the pamphlet Die deutsche Sozialdemokratie, ihre Geschichte und ihre Lehre; eine historisch-kritische Darstellung, three editions of which were issued in 1877, 1878 and 1879, respectively, by the publishing house belonging to the Weser-£eitung, a National-Liberal (see Note 243) newspaper based in Barmen.
Captivated by the Kantian philosophy, Mehring believed that the history was made by the 'strong personalities', while the workers' movement and, consequently, Social Democracy were not the natural result of the social development.
In the early 1880s Mehring had been revising his views on the socialist move­ ment.
Having joined the Socialist Party of Germany in 1891 he became one of its left-wing leaders.
Engels' attitude to Mehring changed accordingly; right up to his death in 1895 Engels repeatedly praised Mehring's journalistic and academic endeavours.
— 253, 316 355 This letter, which Paul Lafargue passed on to Jules Guesde, formed the basis for Guesde's leading article in the newspaper Le Cri du Peuple, No.
461, 31 January 1885.
The excerpt published here was included in the article in full, where it was stated that a letter written by 'one of the veterans of our great social battles' had been received from London.
Engels examined the issue to which he refers in this excerpt in the article 'Real Imperial Russian Privy Dynamiters' carried by Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
5, 29 January 1885 (see present edition, Vol.
26).
The where­ abouts of the original letter are unknown.
— 255 356 Nihilists — a term used in the 1860s to describe the progressive-minded Russian intellectuals of different social estates.
The Nihilists refused to recognise the domi­ nant ideology and morality, rejected religion and demanded freedom of the per­ sonality.
They advocated equality between the sexes and called for the study of the natural and exact sciences.
Towards the end of the 1860s the term almost com­ pletely disappeared from polemic writing, although it was used later on occasions by reactionary political commentators as a label for revolutionaries.
In West Euro­ pean writing, the term was applied to participants in the Russian revolutionary movement of the 1870s and 1880s, notably the members of the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will).

— 256 358 The series of explosions which Engels is writing about took place on Saturday, 24 January 1885.
The investigation showed that the man responsible for the explosion in the Tower was the same one who had organised the explosion on the under­ ground railway two years previously, when bombs had been placed at Charing Cross and Praed Street stations.
He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment and hard labour.

— 256 359 The reference is to Engels' preface to the first edition of his work The Condition of the Working-Class in England (see present edition, Vol.
4, pp.
302-04) and his dedica­ tion of this book 'to the Working-Classes of Great-Britain' (ibid.
, pp.
297-301).
The preface and dedication were not included in the edition of this work which ap­ peared in the United States (see Note 349).
— 257, 420 360 In February 1886 Engels wrote an article as a preface or epilogue to the American edition of The Condition of the Working-Class in England (see present edition, Vol.

When publication was delayed, Engels considered it essential to write another preface in January 1887 (ibid.
).
The first article was included as an ap­ pendix in the American edition.

Although they had all been returned, booksellers re­ fused to stock the book any longer and from that time it was being distributed di­ rectly from Zurich on advance order only.
— 263 367 In a letter published in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
9, 26 February 1885, Karl Varen-holz, a member of the Social Democratic Federation, came out in defence of Henry Hyndman's policy and attempted to disprove the reasons for the split in the Social Democratic Federation reported by the same newspaper, No.
3, 15 January 1885; the report reflected Engels' views (see this volume, pp.
236-38).
Bernstein's letter to Engels of 15 January gives reason to believe that the report was written by Eleanor Marx-Aveling.
Edward Aveling's reply to Varenholz was carried by Der Sozial­ demokrat, No.
13, 26 March 1885.
Aveling exposed Hyndman's activities in trying to take over the presidency of the Federation, his intrigues against Andreas Scheu and other members of the Federation and the authoritarian practices employed by the editors of Justice, which carried material for the most part reflecting the posi­ tion of Hyndman and his supporters.
— 265 368 The reference is to Maitland Park Crescent, which led into Maitland Park Road.
In the 1870s, this street, together with Modena Villas, Maitland Park Villas and Maitland Park Road was given the single name Maitland Park Road (see also Note 159).
Eleanor Marx-Aveling lived at 67, Maitland Park Road.
— 265 369 Jenny and Karl Marx were buried at Highgate Cemetery in London (see also Note 36).
14 March 1885 was the second anniversary of Marx's death.
— 265 370 The reference is to the group of French workers in the Montceau-les-Mines coal­ field who were arrested in November 1884 on a charge of organising explosions in the mine and the town.
The immediate reason for their arrest was the explosion of 7 November organised by the agent provocateur Claude Brenin, who was in the pay of local police commissar Thévenin.
Those arrested included activists in the workers' movement who had no connection with these explosions.
The role played by Brenin as a provocateur was exposed by the socialist newspaper Le Cri du Peu­ ple, 16 February 1885.
At the trial in late May the accused were sentenced to vari­ ous terms of imprisonment.
— 265 371 On 21 March 1885 Richard Stegemann asked Engels to let him know where he could obtain personal information about Marx for inclusion in a work he was pre­ paring for the press about the latter's economic doctrine.
Stegemann requested Engels, in the absence of printed sources for a biography of Marx, to send him his own thoughts about Marx as a man.
— 266 372 The French government under the leader of the moderate Republicans Jules Ferry, who had held the post since 1883, resigned on 30 March 1885 due to an un­ successful colonial adventure in Indochina.
— 267, 270 3,3 Following the elections in 1884 (see Note 306), the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag was made up of a right-wing majority led by Wilhelm Bios, Bruno Gei­ ser, Karl Frohme, Wilhelm Hasenclever and others, and a left-wing minority led by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht.
— 268, 300 374 The majority of the Social-Democratic group in the German Reichstag, consisting of reformists, tried to dispute the right of the party newspaper — Der Sozialdemo­ krat— to criticise the action of the parliamentary group and its attitude towards the bill envisaging the payment of subsidies to steamship companies (see Note 342).
They published a statement to this effect in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
14, 2 April 1885.
However, the majority of the local Social-Democratic organisations resolutely supported the editors.
The reformists were virtually forced to renounce their objec­ tions and, in a joint statement with the editors of Der Sozialdemokrat published on 23 April, they recognised the newspaper's status as the 'organ of the whole party' (see also notes 380 and 390).
—268, 269, 275, 290, 300, 313, 323 375 Until 1885, France was divided into 'small constituencies', each sending one repre­ sentative to the Chamber of Deputies.
In June 1885, on the initiative of the moder­ ate bourgeois republicans, a system of voting by department lists was introduced.
Under this system, which operated until 1889, small constituencies were combined to form larger ones each corresponding to a department.
Now a voter received a ballot paper with names of candidates from different parties, but he was obliged to vote for the total number of candidates to be elected, with one deputy for every 70,000 people.
A deputy was considered elected in the first ballot provided he had received an absolute majority of votes; a relative majority was sufficient in the second ballot.

— 271, 284 378 In March and April 1885 there was a conflict between Britain and Russia caused by their rivalry over the area around the North-West frontier of Afghanistan.
Fol­ lowing the annexation of Southern Turkestan by Russia there was a clash between Russian and Afghan forces, the latter supported by Britain, which threatened to escalate into an armed conflict between the two powers.
However, the diplomatic isolation of Britain due to the position taken by Germany, forced the Gladstone ad­ ministration to step down in its dispute with Russia about the division of spheres of influence in Central Asia.
The April issue of the organ of the Socialist League— The Commonweal Notes (No.
3) —carried an article by Ernest Belfort Bax entitled 'At Bay!' in which he set out his views on the foreign policies pursued by Britain and Russia, including those on the Anglo-Russian conflict.

XIV, Berlin, 1833, S.
62).
Explaining the expression 'Socratic irony', Hegel wrote: 'All dialectics regard as valid what should be valid, as if it were valid, have the inner destruction develop of its own accord on this account — general irony of the world.
' — 281, 348 7 This letter is Engels' reply to Richard Stegemann's second request (see Note 371) that he write a short personal description of Marx for a work Stegemann was pre­ paring on the latter's economic doctrine.
Stegemann justified his request with a need to reply to the efforts being made by bourgeois authors in various countries to distort Marx's personality.
— 282 8 Tuileries documents is the name Engels gives to the lists of agents in the pay of Napoleon III found in the Tuileries in 1870 and published by the government of the Third Republic in September 1871.
Under the letter 'V was the note 'Vogt — in August 1859 has been sent a remittance of 40,000 francs.
' This bore out Marx's assumption that Karl Vogt was a Bonapartist agent (see K.
Marx, Herr Vogt; present edition, Vol.
17, pp.
190, 212).
Engels wrote about this document in the article 'Once Again "Herr Vogt"' published in May 1871 (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
303).
—282 389 On the conflict between the parliamentary group and the editorial board, see Note 374.
The original text of the parliamentary group's decision of 20 March 1885 carried by Der Sozialdemokrat contained a clause saying that the parliamentary group bore 'moral responsibility' for the newspaper's contents.
This met with objections on the part of members of the editorial board, including Eduard Bernstein.
The parliamentary group had sent Wilhelm Liebknecht to Zurich, the place of publica­ tion, to settle the conflict.
The text published by Der Sozialdemokrat on 2 April 1885 contained, among other things, the following remark: 'the party organ must under no circumstances become opposed to the parliamentary group, which bears the moral responsibility for the contents of the same', and continued, 'It is not the paper which has to determine the stance of the parliamentary group, but the par­ liamentary group which has to monitor the stance of the paper.
' — 284 390 The reference is to the statement by the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag and the editors of the paper carried by Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
17, 23 April 1885, in which it was stated that any attempt to limit criticism in the party would be a violation of party principles and would shake it to the foundations.
As for the re­ lations between the parliamentary group and the editorial board, the statement represented a compromise.
It pointed out, on the one hand, that Der Sozialdemok­ rat was the organ of the party as a whole but that, on the other hand, the parlia­ mentary group was the party's representative body and had a right to monitor the work of the editorial board.
On the parliamentary group's first statement, see Note 374.
-284 391 The protective tariffs system was introduced by Bismarck in 1879 in the interest of the landowners and large industrialists and remained in force throughout the 1880s (in 1885 and 1887 it was supplemented by further rises in the duties payable on import­ ed agricultural produce).
To a certain extent it promoted the growth of German industry, but brought a major deterioration in the situation of the masses.
This led to major discontent, not only among the proletariat, but also the middle and petty bourgeoisie.

-286 393 In a letter of 13 May 1885 Hermann Schlüter asked Engels to help him select revo­ lutionary poems and songs for inclusion in a collection from a series of poems for workers which he was preparing for the press.
Among other things, Schlüter was interested in songs and poems originating from the period of peasant uprisings in the 15th and 16th centuries, the revolution of 1848 in Germany and the time of the English Chartists which had been in general circulation.
(The collec­ tion appeared in Zurich in 1886 under the title Vorwärts! Eine Sammlung von Gedich­ tenfür das arbeitende Volk.
) In the same letter Schlüter informed Engels of his inten­ tion to publish a number of minor works and articles by Marx, including some documents from the International, within the framework of the Sozialdemokrati­ sche Bibliothek series (see also Note 352).
— 286 394 Engels is referring to Luther's choral 'Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott' ('God is our firm stronghold'), which Heine, in his %ur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland, called the 'Marseillaise of the Reformation' (Der Salon, Vol.
2, Ham­ burg, 1835, p.
80).
In the Introduction to his Dialectics of Nature Engels calls this choral the 'Mar­ seillaise of the sixteenth century' (see present edition, Vol.
25, p.
319).
— 286 395 The reference is to a song written in 1844 by Matthäus Friedrich Chemnitz and beginning with the words 'Schleswig-Holstein, meerumschlungen' (Schleswig-Holstein, surrounded by the sea).
It was particularly popular in 1848-50, during the struggle for Schleswig-Holstein's liberation from Danish rule.
The Heckerlied is a revolutionary song about the Baden-Palatinate uprising of 1848 led, among others, by Friedrich Hecker, a prominent figure among the South German petty bourgeoisie.
Engels gave the version of the chorus cited below in his work The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution (present edition, Vol.
10, p.
149).
—287 396 The Marseillaise—a French, revolutionary song.
The words and music were written in Strasbourg in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle.
Its original title was 'Chant du guerre pour l'armée du Rhin' ('War chant for the Rhine army').
Having become widespread in the Republican army, it made its way to Marseilles, thus receiving the name 'Marseilles March' or 'Marseillaise', and later became popular in Paris.
— 287 397 A conflict arose between Prosper Lissagaray, editor-in-chief of La Bataille and its publisher Périnet.
With assistance from Paul Brousse and his supporters, Périnet staged an abortive attempt to gain control of the editorship and pocket 10,000 francs donated to the newspaper by Capoul, a former singer.
— 288 398 The article by Louis-Edouard Grimaux referred to below ('Les substances colloï­ dales et la coagulation', Revue scientific, Vol.
XXXV, 1885) contains the follow­ ing quote from Carl Schorlemmer, 'If chemists ever succeed in artificially obtain­ ing proteins, they will be in the form of living protoplasm.
' And later on, 'The enigma of life can only be resolved by protein synthesis.
' — 289 399 The reference is to sections 5 and 6 of Volume III of Capital (see present edition, Vol.
37).
—290 400 An incomplete copy of this letter signed by Engels is to be found at the Interna­ tional Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.
The copy carries the address of the sender and the date of writing ('London, 19 May 1885, 122, Regent's Park Road, N.
W.
'), the first paragraph of the draft and the following note by Engels: 'The original of this letter was sent to Nitti in Naples on 26.

' — 291 401 Engels wrote the note on Mark (see present edition, Vol.
26, p.
236) for Chapter VII ('The Gens Among the Celts and Germans') of the Italian translation of his work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.
— 291 402 On 21 May 1885 Paul Lafargue was sent to Ste Pélagie prison, Paris, for two months for failing to pay a fine of 100 francs imposed on him in April 1883 by a jury in Moulins as punishment for his public speeches (see Note 9).
To begin with, Lafargue was kept in the cell reserved for criminals, but later transferred to the part of the prison where the political detainees were kept.
— 292, 297, 301, 303, 310, 495 403 Paul Lafargue intended to translate Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Prop­ erty and the State into French, but failed to carry out this plan.
The French transla­ tion was done by Henri Rave from the fourth German edition edited by Laura La­ fargue and looked through by Engels; it appeared in Paris in 1893.
— 293, 394 404 On 24 May 1885 a demonstration was organised in Paris in memory of the mem­ bers of the Paris Commune.
Carrying red flags, the demonstrators made their way to the Mur des Fédérés in Père-Lachaise cemetery where 200 members of the Com­ mune had been shot on 27 May 1871.
The police attacked the demonstrators on the pretext that it was forbidden to carry red flags on demonstrations in Paris.
A clash ensued in which a number of people were killed and injured.
Engels expected that the police would try to organise a similar act of provoca­ tion on 1 June during the funeral of Victor Hugo who had died on 22 May 1885.

— 294 406 Between 1869 and 1873 Marx maintained regular correspondence with Nikolai Danielson, who systematically sent him Russian books and articles in journals dealing with the agrarian question in Russia.
In his letter of 24 April (6 May) 1885, Danielson enquired of Engels whether the statistics on the Russian econo­ my had been included in the third volume of Capital.
The chapter on ground rent to which Engels refers forms part of Section 6 of Volume III of Capital (see present edition, Vol.

— 296 410 This letter has survived in the form of an excerpt (the beginning of the letter and name of the addressee are missing).
According to the International Institute of So­ cial History in Amsterdam, where the original is kept, it was written on the letter which A.
N.
Davisson sent to Engels on 10 June 1885.
The note 'Soc.
League' on Engels' letter suggests that the addressee was John Lincoln Mahon, the secretary of the said organisation (see Note 346).

—300, 302, 304 412 Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
17, 23 April 1885 published a statement adopted by a meeting of Social Democrats in Frankfurt-am-Main and sharply criticising the position of the majority of the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag and its at­ tempts to impose this position on the party as a whole (see Note 374).
On 7 May 1885 Karl Frohme, one of the leaders of the parliamentary group, published a let­ ter attacking this statement in response to this in the bourgeois Frankfurter Journal.
The editorial board of Der Sozialdemokrat reprinted Frohme's letter (No.
20, 14 May 1885) and in the next issue, 21 May 1885 published August Bebel's article in reply called 'Auch "ein Protest" ' in which he criticised Frohme's position.
— 302, 307 4 '3 The Hamburg party organisation, which supported the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag in its conflict with the editorial board of Der Sozialdemokrat (see Note 374), donated 1,000 francs to the French socialists' election fund.
— 303 414 Engels is referring to the resignation in June 1885 of the Liberal cabinet under Gladstone due to the refusal of the majority in parliament (Conservatives and Irish members) to vote for the government proposal to increase taxes on spirits.
The real reasons for the resignation were the failures in colonial policy — the concessions to Russia when it came to dividing up spheres of influence in Central Asia (see Note 378) and the major defeats inflicted on the British forces by rebels in the Su­ dan— as well as the government's refusal to grant Irish self-administration in the framework of the British Empire.
— 303 415 Tories—traditional name of the Conservative Party.
The Whigs were the right wing of the Liberal Party, and the Radicals its left wing.
The Whigs expressed the interests of the landed, and in part, financial aris­ tocracy, of the big and medium capitalist farmers, whilst the Radicals were thé representatives of large sections of the trading and industrial bourgeoisie, the bour­ geois intelligentsia and the rich trade unions.
The Liberal Party exerted an influ­ ence on the trade unions through the Radicals, who recognised the need for demo­ cratic social reforms.
The differences between the Whigs and the Radicals became particularly clear during the preparations for the electoral reform of 1884, when the Whigs opposed the extension of the suffrage to Irish peasants and the establish­ ment of constituencies of equal size, thus backing the Conservatives.
Most of the Radicals favoured Home Rule and improvements in the agrarian law.
However some of them, headed by J.
Chamberlain, wanted to keep the Union of 1801 in­ tact.
The rivalry between the Whigs and the Radicals became aggravated on the eve of the 1885 general election which the Radicals expected would bring them victory in the party and the country as a whole (see notes 299 and 487).
It was at this time that the political outlook of the Radical movement took its final shape, as expressed in 'The Radical Programme with a Preface of J.
Chamberlain', London, 1885 (see also Note 430).
—304, 326, 345, 367, 369, 389 416 The trials of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung and the Rhenish district committee of Democrats took place in Cologne on 7 and 8 February 1849.
The accused at the first trial were Karl Marx as editor-in-chief, Frederick Engels as co-editor and Hermann Korff as responsible publisher.
Those indicted at the second trial were Marx, Karl Schapper and the lawyer Schneider II.
The trials ended with the ac­ cused being acquitted.
They were reported in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung — the first on 14 February and the second on 19, 25, 27 and 28 February 1849.
In October 1885 the report on the trial of the Rhenish district committee of Democrats was published as a separate pamphlet in the Sozialdemokratische Bibliothek series in Hottingen-Zurich.
Entitled Karl Marx vor den Kölner Geschwornen.

26, p.
304).
— 304 4 '7 There was no separate collected edition of Marx's and Engels' articles about the June insurrection (see present edition, Vol.

— 305, 309, 332 4 '8 The reference is to a separate edition of Wilhelm Wolffs series of articles on the situation of the Silesian peasants called Die schlesische Milliarde and printed in a number of issues of the Neue Rheinische Leitung between 22 March and 22 April 1849.
Engels included a preface in this edition, which came out in 1886.
Its first section was a biography of Wolff which he had written back in 1876 (see F.
Engels, 'Wilhelm Wolff, present edition, Vol.
24) but in a much abbreviated form, whilst the second section was the article 'On the History of the Prussian Peasants.

At that time Engels was negotiating with the publish­ ers Kegan Paul and Co.
about publishing the English translation of the first volume of Capital (see Note 56).
These negotiations ended without success.
Marx's work was put out by another publishing house and Deville's book did not appear in English.
—310, 313 421 Engels spent his holidays on the island of Jersey from 14 August to 14 September 1885.
—310, 315, 321-25, 328, 358 422 The German socialist Gertrud Guillaume-Schack, who was preparing an article on the limitation of female labour, wrote to Engels on 1 July 1885 to ask whether it was true that he and Marx had been involved in drawing up the programme of the French Workers' Party, which contained the demand that equal pay be given for equal work.
Following the establishment of the French Workers' Party at a congress in Marseilles in October 1879, the French socialist Jules Guesde began work on the party programme and, through Paul Lafargue, requested Marx and Engels to help draw up a draft election manifesto for the French Workers' Party.
The theoretical introduction was formulated by Marx and dictated to Guesde (see K.
Marx, 'Pre­ amble to the Programme of the French Workers' Party', present edition, Vol.
24, p.
340).
The practical part of the programme (minimum programme, see Vol.
24, Note 384) was compiled by Guesde and Lafargue.
The programme was endorsed at the party congress held in Le Havre in 1880.
On the Rouen tendency, or the Guesdists, see Note 201.
— 311 423 The whereabouts of the original of this letter are not known.
The draft of the letter was written by Engels on a letter which John Lincoln Mahon had written to him (on paper used by the editorial board of The Commonweal) on 11 July 1885.
— 312 454 Under the heading 'The Parting of the Waters', The Edinburgh Review, No.
331, July 1885, contained a summary of the parliamentary debates for 1884-85.
It sharp­ ly criticised the policies pursued by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party (see Note 415).
The author of the summary called on the Whigs to split with the Radi­ cal wing, describing this act as a 'watershed'.
— 314 425 In a letter of 10 July 1885 to the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 162) Wilhelm Liebknecht objected to the Society's proposal that an extraordinary party congress be held due to the conflict between the reformist ma­ jority in the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag and the editorial board of Der Sozialdemokrat.
He supposed that the disagreements, including that between the Frankfurt organisation and Karl Frohme (see Note 412), were not of a major nature and could thus quickly be settled with his mediation.
— 315 426 On 14 July 1885 Wilhelm Liebknecht spoke to a meeting of Social Democrats in Offenbach and criticised the letter by the group of Frankfurt Social Democrats which had been published in Der Sozialdemokrat (see Note 412).
His words ap­ peared in the Berliner Volksblatt, 18 July 1885.
The dissatisfaction his speech created in the Frankfurt Social-Democratic organisation led to Liebknecht publishing a statement in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
32, 6 August 1885, claiming that his criti­ cism only related to the tone of the letter and that he rated highly the fight waged against the Anti-Socialist Law by the Social Democrats in Frankfurt.
— 315 427 Engels is evidently referring to Karl Kautsky's book Der Einfluss der Volksvermeh­ rung auf den Fortschritt der Gesellschaft, Vienna, 1880, which he sharply criticised for its Malthusian errors in a letter to Kautsky of 1 February 1881 (see present edi­ tion, Vol.
46) and also to a series of articles about marriage in primitive society with the general heading 'Die Entstehung der Ehe und Familie' published in Kos­ mos, Jg.
VI, Stuttgart, 1882-83 (see Engels' letters to Laura Lafargue of 16-17 February and to August Bebel of 7 March 1883; present edition, Vol.
46, and also this volume, p.
56).
— 316 428 Maybe this refers to Franz Mehring's articles on Rodbertus in Demokratische Blät­ ter, Nos.
19, 20 and 21, 13, 20 and 28 May 1885, or his article 'Der soziale Beruf des Adels' in Volks-Zeitung, Nos.
155 and 156, 7 and 8 July 1885.
— 316 429 The Radicals — in the 1880s and 1890s a parliamentary group which had split away from the party of moderate republicans in France ('Opportunists', see Note 236).
The Radicals had their main base in the petty and, to some extent, the middle bourgeoisie and continued to press for a number of bourgeois-democratic demands: a single-chamber parliamentary system, the separation of the Church from the State, the introduction of a system of progressive income taxes, the limitation of the working day and settlement of a number of other social issues.
The leader of the Radicals was Clemenceau.
The group formed officially as the Republican Party of Radicals and Radical Socialists [Parti républicain radical et radical-socialiste) in 1901.

In 1886 this wing, which opposed the granting of Irish self-administration, split off and a Liberal-Unionist bloc headed by Joseph Chamber­ lain was formed of supporters of the 1801 Union of Ireland with Great Britain; the Liberal-Unionists backed the Conservatives on most issues.
They constituted a po­ litical expression of a major regrouping among the British ruling classes and signi­ fied a shift to the right.
— 317, 391 431 In 1688-89, as a result of the coup d'état which brought William III (of Orange) to power in England, absolutism was abolished as the form of government and re­ placed by a constitutional monarchy.
Parliament became the supreme organ of state power, carrying out the will of the bourgeoisie and the new nobility.

'—322, 324 440 A hint that Louis Viereck was the illegitimate son of Emperor William I of Ger­ many.
Engels is referring to Viereck's speech on 8 August at a workers' meeting in Munich in which he said that the emperor would give the workers much more if he knew how poorly they lived.
The Munich Social Democrats protested at Viereck's speech (see Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
34, 20 August 1885).
In his reply, published in the Munich-based Deutsches Wochenblatt, No.
30, 30 August and Der Sozialdemok­ rat, No.
36, 3 September 1885, Viereck, to all intents and purposes, supported Bis­ marck's social reform (see Note 312).
— 324, 328 441 Engels is referring to the conflict which emerged between Germany and Spain in August-September 1885 as a result of Germany's attempts to seize the Caroline is-Notes lands to which Spain laid claim.
The German government sent a gunboat to one of the islands, where the German flag was raised.
This led to tension in the relations between the two states.
Pope Leo XIII, who acted as arbitrator, supported the Spanish claims.
— 324 442 On 20 September 1885 in Paris, during the funeral of Antoine Jules Arnaud, a member of the Paris Commune, the police used the excuse that processions with red banners were prohibited to attempt to seize the red cover which had been placed over the deceased and attacked those attending the funeral.
— 326 443 The reference is to the English socialists' free speech struggles against the police suppression of outdoor meetings.
Between July and September 1885 the London police on several occasions arrested socialist speakers at meetings in the East End.
One of them, John E.
Williams, a member of the Social Democratic Federation, was sentenced to a month's hard labour.
This prompted the Social Democratic Federation, the Socialist League, the Labour Emancipation League and the London Radical Clubs (see Note 659) to organise a joint meeting on 20 September in the area of Dod Street, which was attended by several thousand people.
The police tried to arrest the speakers, but met with resistance.
Several people were detained, but released the next day.
This was reported in The Daily News of 21 and 22 Sep­ tember.
— 326 444 Laura Lafargue's French translation of the Manifesto of the Communist Party was published in Le Socialiste, Nos.
1-11, from late August to early November 1885.
It was published with Engels' changes as an appendix to Mermeix (pseudonym), La France Socialiste, Paris, 1886.
—326, 328, 333, 342 445 The reference is to the so-called Bulgarian crisis which began in September 1885.
In the night of 5-6 September an uprising of Bulgarian patriots occurred in Plovdiv, the capital of Eastern Roumelia (Southern Bulgaria), which, according to the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, was under the control of Turkey (see present edition, Vol.
45, Note 430).
The Turkish governor was overthrown.
Roumelia was reunited with Bulgaria and Grand Duke (formerly Prince) Alexander Battenberg of Bulgaria proclaimed himself ruler of the united Bulgaria on 8 September.
Russia, showing its displeasure at the rapprochement between Battenberg and Austria-Hungary which had begun some time previously, recalled its officers from the Bulgarian army.
Reports on this were carried by the Kölnische Leitung, Nos.
276, 277, 278 and 279, 5, 6, 7 and 8 October 1885.
On the subsequent course of the Bulgarian crisis, see Engels' article 'The Po­ litical Situation in Europe' (present edition, Vol.
26, and also this volume, pp.
512-20 and notes 478 and 634).
—329, 364, 378-79, 417, 485, 488 446 The reference is to the trial of a group of German Social Democrats at the Saxon provincial court in Chemnitz between 28 and 30 September 1885.
Auer, Bebel, Dietz, Müller, Ulrich, Viereck, Vollmar, Frohme and Heinzel were charged with belonging to a secret society seeking by illegal means to hinder the implementation of laws and regulations issued by the authorities.
The reason for the indictment was their participation in the 1883 congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Ger­ many in Copenhagen (see Note 15).
In the, absence of proof of their guilt, the court acquitted them.
The government appealed to the imperial court which passed on the case for re-examination at the provincial court in Freiberg, Saxony (see Note 602).
—330 447 At the elections held on 4 October 1885 to the French Chamber of Deputies, nu­ merous candidates failed to receive the number of votes required for election, so that a second ballot was scheduled for 18 October.
This ballot brought a republi­ can majority, comprising representatives of the party of moderate republicans ('Opportunists') and the party of Radicals (see notes 236 and 429).
The Chamber of Deputies was made up of 382 republicans (including 180 Radicals) and 202 monarchists.
—330, 364, 430 448 The views about the elections in France which Engels sets out in this letter were re­ flected in the leading article in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
42, 15 October 1885.
— 330 449 The results of the first ballot gave rise to'particular disappointment among the French socialists.
This prompted Engels to explain to Paul Lafargue the essence of the situation in France.
An excerpt from his letter was printed in Le Socialiste with the title 'The Situation' (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
331-32).
The whereabouts of the full text of the letter are not known.
— 331 450 Apart from the works mentioned in the text, Engels also included in the new edi­ tion of Marx's pamphlet Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne a fourth appendix — 'The Communist Trial in Cologne' — to Marx's work Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol.
17, pp.
305-11 ) and his afterword to the second Ger­ man edition of the pamphlet (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
51-54).
— 332 451 This letter was written on a postcard and carries the following address in Engels' handwriting: 'Monsieur P.
Lavroff, 328 rue St.
Jacques, Paris, France.
'—337 452 In a letter of 19 October 1885 Pyotr Lavrov asked Engels to let him know what materials he might use for a work he was planning to write on Chartism.
— 337 453 Engels attached great importance to publicising the experience of Chartism as the first political movement of the British working class.
It is thought that in the 1880s he wrote special notes for inclusion in Die Chartistenbewegung in England by the German democrat Sigismund Borkheim, although Engels' text has not yet been found.
Die Chartistenbewegung in England (Zurich, 1887) by the German social­ ist Hermann Schlüter was based on a chronology of Chartism compiled in August 1886 by Engels at the request of the author (see present edition, Vol.
26).
— 337 454 The Social Democrat Salo Faerber from Breslau suggested that Engels write an ar­ ticle on the financial position of Russia in the Volks-Leitung, Berlin, with a view to hindering subscriptions to Russian loan bonds in Germany.
— 337 455 Here, Engels is alluding to the following statement in the Reichstag by Heinrich von Stephan, head of the postal and telegraph service: 'The secrecy of the mail rests just as firmly on the conscience of the German Empire's postal officials as the Bible does on the altar.
'—337, 361 456 The reference is to the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 which was caused by a growth in the activities of the national liberation movement in the Balkans and the exacerbation of international conflicts in the Middle East.
The war ended in victory for Russia.
In 1806, Prussia joined the fourth anti-French coalition, and its army was soon routed by the Napoleonic forces at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt.
— 339 457 The reference is to Wilhelm Liebknecht's reply to Salo Faerber's letter requesting him to shed light on the state of Russian finances in his Reichstag speech during the third reading of the budget.
In the letter Liebknecht explained the reasons why he had not made any speech.
— 339 458 At the elections to the Saxon Provincial Diet on 15 September 1885 Liebknecht, who was standing for the rural district around Leipzig, lost at the hands of a can­ didate jointly nominated by the Conservatives (see Note 230) and the National Li­ berals (see Note 243).
The poll was held in line with the electoral qualifications set out in the law of 1868; the vote extended to persons of 25 and over who had paid at least three marks in direct taxes, whilst to stand as a candidate it was necessary to be not less than 30 years of age, to have paid at least 30 marks in direct taxes and have been a Saxon citizen for a minimum of three years.
— 340 459 The French Utopian socialist Etienne Cabet tried to organise a communist colony in North America made up of several hundred of his followers drawn from among the French workers.
The colony existed from 1848 to 1856.
The last communist community in the United States, which had been formed by adherents of Cabet, ceased to exist in 1895.
— 342 460 In 1880, at the request of Paul Lafargue, Engels transformed three chapters of his Anti-Diihring (Chapter I of the 'Introduction' and Chapters I and II of Part three — see present edition, Vol.
25, pp.
16-27 and 244-71) into a popular work in its own right.
Entitled Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, it was published under the heading 'Socialisme utopique et socialisme scientifique' in the French journal La Revue socialiste, Nos.
3, 4 and 5, 20 March, 20 April and 5 May 1880, and later that year under the same heading as a separate pamphlet in Paris.
— 342 461 The words by Reichstag deputy Ludwig Bamberger which became a standard phrase were uttered at one of the 1876 sittings to describe the manner in which Bis­ marck dealt with the National Liberals.
— 342 462 Engels is referring to the Kulturkampf, a word which has come to describe the meas­ ures taken by the Bismarck government in the 1870s against the Catholic Church and the Party of the Centre, which was closely associated with it (see Note 229).
Between 1871 and 1875 a number of laws were passed which were designed to weaken the Party of the Centre and the Catholic clergy who supported it.
How­ ever, the Church refused to submit.
In the latter half of the 1870s and the early 1880s, given the growth of the labour movement, Bismarck sought to rally all reac­ tionary forces and steered a course of reconciliation with the Catholic Church, as a result of which most of these laws were repealed.
— 343, 434, 511 463 The reference is to an attempted coup aimed at restoring the monarchy in France and staged in 1877 by Marshal Mac-Mahon, President of the Third Republic.
However, Mac-Mahon failed to gain support not only from large sections of the general public but also from a section of the officers and rank-and-file soldiers, who reflected the republican sentiments among the French peasantry.
The parliamen­ tary elections of October 1877 brought victory for the republicans and the forma­ tion of a government made up of bourgeois republicans; Mac-Mahon resigned in January 1879.
—343, 430 464 The reference is to the following passage contained in the preface to the 1872 Ger­ man edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party: '.
.
.
in view of the practical expe­ rience gained .
.
.
in the Paris Commune, where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months, this programme has in some details become antiquated.
One thing especially was proved by the Commune, .
.
.
that "the work­ ing class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes"' (see present edition, Vol.
23, p.
175).
— 344 465 Olivia, written by the English playwright W.
G.
Wills, is an adaptation of Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield.
— 345 466 In a letter of 8 August 1885 the French socialists Paul Lavigne asked Engels to look through the manuscript of his translation of Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.
— 345, 358 46 ' This is the number of votes Paul Lafargue received at the election to the French Chamber of Deputies in October 1885 (see Note 447).
— 345 468 Engels is referring to the passage in his work On the History of the Communist League where he deals with the activities of Stephan Born, a member of the League; at this point he also indicates that Born's real surname was Buttermilch (see present edi­ tion, Vol.
26, pp.
325-26).
Born does not figure among the list of names Georg Adler thanks for their assistance in the preface to the said book by Adler.
— 346 469 The Thirty Years' War (1618-48) — a general European war in which the Pope, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs and the Catholic German princes fought against the Protestant countries: Bohemia, Denmark, Sweden, the Republic of the Nether­ lands, and a number of German states.
The Treaty of Westphalia (1648) sealed political dismemberment of Germany.
— 348 470 Nikolai Danielson attached to his letter of 25 August 1885 several excerpts from letters which Marx had written to him on 12 December 1872, 15 and 28 November 1878, 10 April 1879, 12 September 1880 and 19 February and 13 December 1881 (see present edition, Vols.
44, 45 and 46).
Danielson believed that these excerpts — which contained a description of the economic, notably the financial and agrarian, crisis in Britain and several other countries, as well as advice on translating the first volume of Capital into Rus­ sian— might be of use to Engels in his work on the third volume of'Capital and the preface to the second volume.
In his letter of 10 April 1879 Marx also explained why he had not yet completed the second and third volumes of Capital.
— 348 471 The reference is to the economic crisis in Britain and other capitalist countries which Marx dealt with in his letter to Nikolai Danielson of 10 April 1879 (see present edition, Vol.
45).
— 349 4 7 2 This letter is Engels' reply to Paul Lafargue's request (voiced in his letter of 13 No­ vember 1885) for information on his involvement in the May 1849 uprising in Dresden and the Rhine Province.
Lafargue intended to include the information in a biography of Engels he was preparing for publication between 14 November 1885 and 28 August 1886 in the 'Galerie socialiste internationale' column of Le So­ cialiste.
Engels' letter formed the basis for the second part of the biography which appeared unsigned in No.
13 of the newspaper, 21 November 1885.
The same issue carried a portrait of Engels by the artist Clarus; Lafargue sent Engels a copy of this portrait together with the letter mentioned.
— 350 473 Engels gives a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the movement in support of the Imperial Constitution and the course of armed hostilities in Rhenish Prussia, Notes Baden and the Palatinate in The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution (see present edition, Vol.
10).
— 350 474 Landwehr —the army reserve formed in Prussia during the struggle against Napo­ leon.
In the 1840s it consisted of men under forty who had done three years active service and not less than two years in the reserve.
In contrast to the regular army, conscription to the army reserve took place in cases of extreme necessity (war, or threat of war).
— 351, 485 475 The sitting of the Reichstag opened on 19 November 1885.
— 352 476 The German Social Democrat and Reichstag deputy Georg Schumacher wrote to Engels on 14 August 1885 in an attempt to justify the position taken by those who had voted in favour of state subsidies for steamship companies in the Reichstag (see Note 342).
On Engels' attitude to this issue, see this volume, pp.
240-42.
— 353 477 Wilhelm Liebknecht served a four-week prison sentence in Leipzig beginning on 29 September 1885.
It is roughly during this period that Der Sozialdemokrat car­ ried a series of his articles headed 'Ueber den Normalarbeitstag' (22 and 29 Octo­ ber, 5, 12 and 19 November 1885).
—353 478 The reference is to the first battle of the Serbian-Bulgarian war, which took place on 16 November 1885.
The war was caused by the so-called Bulgarian crisis (see notes 445 and 634).
Under the influence of Austria-Hungary, Serbia declared war on Bulgaria on 14 November 1885, demanding territorial compensation for the growth in Bulgarian territory.
The Bulgarian forces inflicted a crushing defeat on the Serbian army in the very first month and entered Serbia.
Bulgaria ceased its advance under pressure from Austria-Hungary and, on 3 March 1886, a peace treaty was concluded in Bucharest under which Serbia recognised the borders of the reunited Bulgaria.

— 355 480 This letter is the reply to that of 15 October 1885 from Minna Kautsky, Karl Kautsky's mother, who had got to know Engels during her stay in London in the summer of 1885.
She described her impressions of London and Berlin to Engels and asked his opinion of her book Die Alten und die Neuen.
— 355 481 It follows from Paul Lafargue's letter to Engels of 4 November 1885 that Engels asked Lafargue for information on Paul Lavigne.
Lafargue wrote: 'The question you ask concerning Lavigne is difficult to answer.
One fine day he appeared in our midst saying that he had translated Marx's 18th Brumaire and The Holy Family, that Fortin did not know the ABC of German.
.
.
.
Believing him to be a giant re­ freshed in German we commissioned him to translate the Manifesto.
But after going over the translation for the first number, we decided it had to be thrown into the waste-paper basket.
.
.
.
Lavigne seems to me slightly mad.
.
.
.
' Lavigne wrote to Engels on 8 August 1885 saying, among other things, that he intended to translate the second volume of Marx's Capital.
— 358 482 Apart from Paul Lavigne's manuscript, this refers to the translation of Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (present edition, Vol.
11 ) done by Edouard Fortin (see this volume, p.
345).
This translation, edited by Engels, was published in Le Socialiste, January-November 1891 and appeared as a separate volume dur­ ing the same year in Lille.
— 358, 528 483 Edouard Fortin repeatedly wrote to Marx in 1881 in connection with his study of the first volume of Capital (see K.
Marx to Charles Longuet of 4 January 1881; present edition, Vol.
46).

— 359, 363, 448 485 Liebknecht wrote to Engels on 26 November 1885 asking his assistance in obtain­ ing material in English on the financial situation of Russia for a'speech he was to make in the Reichstag about the granting of a German loan to Russia.
Liebknecht made use of Engels' recommendations during his Reichstag speech of 8 February 1886 (see also Note 551).
—359, 365, 377 486 The speech by Wilhelm Liebknecht to which Engels refers was made in the Reichstag on 24 November 1885.
In it, Liebknecht sharply criticised Bismarck's home and foreign policy, for which he was called to order.
— 361 487 The British general election took place from 23 November to 19 December 1885.
The Liberals obtained 335 seats of which 4 belonged to the 'independents', the Conservatives 249 and the supporters of Irish Home Rule, 86 seats.
These were the first elections held after the parliamentary reform of 1884 (see Note 299).
— 361, 364, 367, 390 488 At the beginning of the 1880s, the English bourgeoisie started to call for protective tariffs due to growing competition on the world market from the United States and Germany, thus departing from the principles of free trade as advocated by the Manchester school (see Note 283).
— 361 489 The slogan The Church in danger\ was advanced by the Conservatives during the British election campaign in the autumn of 1885.
It was prompted by the fact that the Liberals supported the demand raised by bourgeois-radical elements and Irish Catholics for the separation of the Anglican Church from the state.
When the Con­ servative propaganda attracted a favourable response among a large number of voters, the Liberals to all intents and purposes ceased to support this demand.
— 361 490 This letter was written in connection with the preparatory work Karl Kautsky was doing — at Engels' initiative and on his instructions (see this volume, p.
344) — on a résumé of Die Geschichte der ersten Sozialpolitischen Arbeiterbewegung in Deutschland by the German Journalist Georg Adler.
The book depicted the history of the Com­ munist League and Marx's revolutionary activities in a distorted manner.
The ré­ sumé was published in Die Neue Zeit, No.
2, February 1886.
— 362 491 In his book Georg Adler wrote that, as editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Marx had allegedly been constantly subjected to insults and physical attacks which posed a serious threat to his life.
In his résumé of the book, Karl Kautsky ridiculed this allegation as instructed by Engels.
By way of proof he cited an episode recalled to him by Engels.
Two armed non-commissioned officers had appeared at Marx's home demanding retribution for his alleged derision of the title of non­ commissioned officer.
Marx had greeted them in a dressing gown with the butt of Notes an unloaded pistol protruding from the pocket.
At the sight of this, the NCOs had quickly taken their leave (see present edition, Vol.
38, pp.
192-93).
— 362 492 Georg Adler claimed in his book (see Note 490) that Moses Hess had taken part in the South German uprising of May 1849, for which he had been sentenced to death.
In his résumé, Karl Kautsky refuted this unsubstantiated claim on Engels' instructions.
— 362 493 The reference is to the works by Marx which were prepared for republication and issued with Engels' prefaces by the German Social-Democratic publishing house in Hottingen-Zurich in 1885-86: 'The Preface to the Pamphlet Karl Marx Before the Cologne Jury'; On the History of the Communist League (see present edition, Vol.
26), and also Engels' work 'On the History of the Prussian Peasants.
The In­ troduction to Wilhelm Wolffs Pamphlet The Silesian Milliard' (see present edi­ tion, Vol.
26) .
— 363 494 In the course of 1884 and 1885 Engels edited the German translation of The Poverty of Philosophy (present edition, Vol.
5), the English translation of The Condition of the Working-Class in England (Vol.
2), the Italian and Danish translations of The Ori­ gin of the Family, Private Property and the State (Vol.
26) as well as the translations of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (Vol.
11 ) and the Manifesto of the Commu­ nist Party (Vol.

—366 496 Henry Mayers Hyndman and Henry Hyde Champion, the leaders of the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300) received money from the Conservative Party to put up their candidates at the 1885 general election (see Note 487).
The Federation fielded candidates in London constituencies — Hampstead and Ken­ sington— where they had no prospects of winning but could capture a proportion of the Liberal vote to the benefit of the Conservatives.
The Federation's leadership attempted to justify their agreement to these conditions by claiming that the elec­ tion campaign merely served as propaganda for the future revolution.
This created displeasure among many of the Federation's members, as a result of which a num­ ber of them resigned and several local organisations split from the Federation.
The Echo, Nos.
5285 and 5287, 5 and 7 December 1885 carried a statement from John Edward Williams, one of the Federation's candidates, claiming he was not aware of the receipt of any money from the Tories, an editorial giving details of how the money had been received and a note by Federation member Charles L.
Fitzgerald criticising the leadership.
Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
51, 17 December 1885, pub­ lished an editorial based on this letter by Engels, material from The Echo and a let­ ter by Hubert Bland, one of the Federation officials, dealing with the meetings of the Executive Committee on 9 and 12 November at which Hyndman and Cham­ pion had been censured for their actions.
— 366-67, 369, 376, 394, 404, 406 497 The reference is to the attempt made by the leaders of the German Conservative Party (see Note 230) and the Christian-Social Party, Adolph Wagner and Adolf Stoecker, to conclude an electoral alliance with the Social Democrats against the candidates of the Party of Progress (see Note 93) during the Berlin elections of No­ vember 1881.
They agreed to support Social-Democratic candidates (August Be-bel and Wilhelm Hasenclever) in two Berlin constituencies on condition that the Socialist Workers' Party acknowledged the 'social reforms' being carried out by Bismarck's government and backed the implementation of these 'reforms' with a view to warding off a revolution.
On behalf of the party, Bebel and Liebknecht sharply rebuffed these manoeuvres on the part of the reactionaries.
Their state­ ment was published in the Volks-^eitung, 19 November 1881.
— 367 498 In a statement headed 'The Socialists and the General Election' and carried by The Pall Mall Gazette, 4 December 1885, John Hunter Watts, the treasurer of the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300), tried to justify the actions of'an ill-advised few London Socialists' by claiming that they intended 'to take ammuni­ tion from the enemy in order to blaze it in their faces'.
— 367 499 The substance of this letter formed the basis for the editorial 'Angleterre' published in Le Socialiste, No.
16, 12 December 1885.
—368 500 The Republican Social Economy Society (Société Républicaine d'Économie sociale) was founded on 7 November 1885 at the initiative of the Possibilist (see Note 237) leader Benoît Malon.
The society set itself the aim of studying the social question and putting forward plans for imminent reforms.
— 368 501 In its leading article 'En Angleterre', dealing with the results of the elections to the House of Commons, Le Socialiste, No.
15, 5 December 1885 quoted from the elec­ tion platform put forward by John Edward Williams, a candidate for the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300), and also mentioned other candidates from this party.
— 368 502 The reference is to two notes by Henry Mayers Hyndman published in Justice, No.
90, 3 October and No.
92, 17 October 1885 where he accuses Edward Aveling of offending against an agreement concluded between various socialist organisations about speeches to be made by socialists at the Dod Street demonstration of 27 Sep­ tember 1885.
Hyndman's accusation was refuted in a statement signed by 31 mem­ bers of socialist organisations.
The statement together with both notes from Justice was carried by The Commonweal, No.
10, November 1885 in an article entitled 'Free Speech and the Police'.
—370, 394 503 On 16 November 1885 Hermann Schlüter wrote to Engels asking for the address of Johann Georg Eccarius, the former secretary of the General Council of the First International.
He intended to reissue the latter's book Eines Arbeiters Widerlegung der national-ökonomischen Lehren John Stuart Mill's in the Social-Democratic pub­ lishing house in Zurich; Schlüter believed that Eccarius would revise his book.
It appeared in 1888, without any changes on Engels' advice.
— 371 504 Engels is referring to the Prussian armed intervention of 1787 in the Netherlands, which was aimed at crushing the uprising by the opposition party of'patriots'.
The party had used the defeat of the Dutch in the war with Britain (1784) to seize power and expel Stadtholder William V.
The Prussian forces invaded the country and restored him to power.
— 372 505 The reference is to the short biography of Marx carried by Le Socialiste, No.
12, 14 November 1885 and probably written by Paul Lafargue.
— 373, 374 506 Hermann Schlüter wrote to Engels on 19 December 1885 that Lothar Bucher, in his pamphlet Der Parlamentarismus wie er ist claimed a Journalist in the pay of Pal-merston had written a pamphlet entitled Palmerston, What Has He Done? at the latter's bidding.
Schlüter asked Engels whether Bucher was not perhaps alluding to Marx's pamphlet Lord Palmerston (present edition, Vol.
12).
— 374 507 The reference is to Paul Lafargue's letter to Engels of 21 January 1885 in which he asked Engels to send him a cheque for £12 (see F.
Engels, Paul and Laura La-fargue, Correspondence, Vol.
1, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1959, p.
322).
—375 508 In his letter of 21 December 1885 Paul Lafargue asked Engels to send him Justice, No.
100, 12 December 1885 containing a statement by Henry Mayers Hyndman and other leaders of the Social Democratic Federation in which they sought to re­ fute the accusations levelled at Hyndman for his having received money from the Conservatives to finance the election campaign (see this volume, pp.
366-68).
—376 509 Engels is playing on the fact — of which Paul Lafargue informed him — that the oldest of all bridges in Paris, the Pont Neuf, which became proverbial for its strength, was partly destroyed when the Seine burst its banks.
It is an allusion to Lafargue's illnesses.
— 376 5 ' ° The obituary to Sigismund Borkheim was carried by Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
3, 15 January 1886 under the heading 'In memoriam!'.
It was probably written by Wil­ helm Liebknecht.
The factual inaccuracies it contained were corrected by the au­ thor in the following issue in a note headed 'Sigismund Borkheim' [Der Sozialde­ mokrat, 21 January 1886).
The date, year and place of Borkheim's birth were put right, as were the years he attended school and a number of facts associated with the events of 1848.
Engels wrote a short biographical sketch of Borkheim by way of an introduc­ tion to S.
Borkheim, ^ur Erinnerung für die deutschen Mordspatrioten.
1806-1807, Hottin-gen-Zurich, 1888.
It was published on Engels' initiative and with his assistance (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
446-51).
—377, 379 51 ' Engels wrote this letter by way of a supplement to his letter of 28 December 1885 to Wilhelm Liebknecht in which he had requested Liebknecht to place the obitu­ ary of Borkheim in Der Sozialdemokrat (see this volume, p.
377).
— 380 512 The Paris Peace Treaty, which ended the Crimean War of 1853-56, was signed by representatives of Russia, Austria, France, Great Britain, Sardinia, Turkey and Prussia on 18 (30) March 1856.
—380 5 '3 The reference is to the clashes of ideas which occurred under the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37) in the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany between December 1884 and mid-July 1885.
The question was whether it was possible for two ideolog­ ical tendencies — revolutionary-proletarian and opportunist—to coexist within the framework of a single party in the German workers' movement.
Differences of principle on a wide range of issues emerged between the representatives of these two tendencies within the Socialist Workers' Party: the strategy and tactics of the workers' movement, inner-party discipline, the significance of parliamentary,ac­ tivity by socialist deputies, the role of the bourgeois state and the social reforms being carried out by the government, etc.
Engels wrote to Bebel setting out his attitude to Liebknecht's position in the conflict as described in this letter (see this volume, p.
387).
— 382 5 '4 The reference is to the annual reports of the Bureau of Statistics of Labor.
From 1869 onwards these bureaus were set up in numerous US states under pressure from workers' organisations.
— 382, 396 5 '5 An allusion to Wilhelm Bios' speech in the Reichstag on 9 January 1886 during the first reading of the bill on the construction of a Baltic canal (see Note 519).
— 383 516 The reference is to the attempt of 14 June 1848 by German workers and artisans during the revolution to seize an arsenal in Berlin.
— 383 517 Engels provided Liebknecht with additional brief biographical details of Bork-heim for the obituary (see this volume, pp.
379 and 381).
— 383 518 The reference is to Bebel's and Liebknecht's planned trip to the United States to raise funds for the German Social Democrats' election campaign (see this volume, pp.
14 and 114).
Liebknecht departed alone on the trip, which lasted from Sep­ tember to December 1886, whilst Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling stayed in the United States almost concurrently with him (see Note 600).
— 383, 391, 429, 446 5 '9 The reference is to the project for the construction of a ship canal in Schleswig-Holstein connecting the harbour of Kiel with the mouth of the River Elbe near Brunsbüttel, subsequently called the Kiel Canal (alternatively, the North Sea-Baltic Canal, Kaiser Wilhelm Canal).
The bill providing for its construction was presented to the Reichstag by Bismarck on 12 December 1885 and discussed on 9 January and 20 February 1886.
It was enacted at the third reading on 25 Febru­ ary 1886.
On Engels' attitude to the bill, see also this volume, p.
388.
— 383 520 In 1884 and 1885 Die Neue Zjil carried a number of articles by Max Quarck.
En-gels vehemently protested against Quarck contributing to the journal (see this volume, pp.
164 and 258).

11, XL—386, 393, 426, 439, 445 522 This letter is Engels' reply to August Bebel's letter of 7 December 1885 in which Bebel insisted on publishing in the press a critique of C.
A.
Schramm, Rodbertus, Marx, Lassalle.
Sozialwissenschaftliche Studie and asked Engels to assist Karl Kautsky with the same.
Schramm's book was the continuation of the polemic between Kautsky and him­ self (see Note 523).
In it the author once again tried to play down the signifi­ cance of Marx's theoretical and practical work.
Eduard Bernstein provided a criti­ cal analysis of this work in a series of articles headed 'Ein moralischer Kritiker und seine kritische Moral' and published in Der Sozialdemokrat, Nos.
4-7, 21, 28 Janu­ ary, 5 and 12 February 1886.
—387, 391 523 Kautsky began the polemic with Schramm by publishing a critique of Rodbertus' Das Kapital von Rodbertus in Die Neue £eit, Nos.
8 and 9, 1884.
This was occasioned by the attempts of the armchair socialists (see Note 54) to set Rodbertus against Marx and depict him as the most outstanding theoretician of political economy.
Engels looked through the article (see this volume, pp.
193-94).
Schramm defend­ ed Rodbertus in the article 'K.
Kautsky und Rodbertus' carried by Die Neue £eit, No.
11, 1884.
The same issue contained Kautsky's reply, 'Eine Replik'.
Following the inclusion under the heading 'Marx und Rodbertus' in the January issue of Die Neue J^eit of Engels' preface to the German translation of Marx's La Misere de la philosophie, the polemic continued in Die Neue Zjil, No.
5, 1885 with the publication of Schramm's 'Antwort an Herrn K.
Kautsky' and Kautsky's reply headed 'Das Schlusswort'.
That marked its end.
— 387 524 The reference is to the expulsion of 30,000 Poles who were not German subjects from the Eastern provinces of Prussia.
This prompted Dr Ludwig von Jazdzewski to request an explanation on behalf of the Polish faction in the Reichstag on 28 No­ vember 1885, a move supported by the Social-Democratic deputies.
At the Reichs­ tag sitting of 1 December 1885 Bismarck made use of a message from William I in an attempt to prevent the matter being discussed.
He claimed that it came under the jurisdiction of the Prussian government and could not therefore be debated by the Reichstag.
However, the Social Democrats successfully insisted on a discussion, which took place on 15-16 January 1886.
— 389 525 This is Engels' reply to a letter from Edward R.
Pease, a member of the Executive Committee of the Fabian Society, who had requested him to write a brief résumé of the most important economic, social and political proposals of the party for a pamphlet called What Is Socialism? that was in preparation.
The Fabian Society — an organisation founded in 1884 by democratically-minded intellectuals.
The society took its name from a Roman general who lived in the third century B.
C, viz.
Quintus Fabius Maximus, surnamed Cunctator ('the delayer') for his cautious tactics in the war against Hannibal.
A leading role in the society was played by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, George Bernard Shaw and oth­ ers.
The branches of the society included among their members workers attracted by the sharp criticism of capitalist relations contained in the Fabians' publications.
The Fabians rejected Marx's and Engels' doctrine of class struggle and the revolu­ tionary transformation of bourgeois society, considering it possible to carry out the transition from capitalism to socialism by way of a number of reforms within the framework of what they called municipal socialism.
— 392 526 Marx's comments on the English translation of Volume I of Capital in the margins of the manuscript in 1877 were occasioned by the planned publication of the book in the United States, which failed to materialise.
Marx then sent the manuscript to Friedrich Adolph Sorge.
Having discovered that Engels was editing the English translation of the first volume, Sorge wrote to him on 3 August 1885 offering to send him the manuscript.
Engels received it in early 1886.
— 393, 439 527 In October 1885 To-Day began to publish the English translation of the first vol­ ume of Capital done by Henry Mayers Hyndman (pseudonym John Broadhouse).
Engels criticised the beginning of this translation (of the first and a part of the sec­ ond sections of Chapter One) carried by To-Day, vol.
4, No.
22, in his article 'How Not to Translate Marx' (see present edition, Vol.

Sorge repeatedly informed Engels that Dietzgen's articles in these newspapers were being altered and distorted.

— 395 531 Engels is replying to a number of questions Nieuwenhuis posed in his letter of 28 January 1886 in connection with his work on the Dutch translation of the pam­ phlet Socialism: Utopian and Scientific; the pamphlet also included Engels' article 'The Mark' as an appendix (see present edition, Vol.

— 397 532 Under the rundale system Irish tenant farmers each paid rent separately for his plot of the land which had formerly belonged to the entire gens but later had been seized by the British invaders.
However, they then put all the arable and grazing land together and divided it into strips according to location and quality, with each farmer receiving a share of each lot.

— 399 534 The reference is to Nikolai Danielson's preface to the first Russian edition of Vol­ ume II of Capital (see notes 155 and 168).
In his letter to Engels of 31 December 1885 Danielson informed the recipient that he had completed the Russian transla­ tion of the second volume of Capital and was waiting for the third volume to ap­ pear.
— 400 535 It is probable that Nikolai Danielson's remarks about the economic situation in Russia were contained in his letters of 30 November, 7 January and 20 January whose whereabouts are unknown.
— 401 536 Greenbackers—a political party in the Western American states formed in March 1875 and chiefly composed of farmers.
It opposed the removal from circulation of the paper money (bills with a green reverse) issued during the Civil War of 1861-65, a measure carried out due to its devaluation.
The Greenbackers wrongly thought that the retention of a large volume of paper money would bring about a rise in the price of agricultural produce.
Following the inclusion of a number of working-class demands in the party programme, a considerable number of workers joined the party, which became known as the Greenback Labor Party.
The party fell apart after 1884.

Lemon, who were expelled at the Trades Union Congress in Manchester in 1882) held a meeting in Trafalgar Square on 8 February 1886.
The Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300) or-Notes ganised a meeting and unemployed demonstration in opposition to the Conserva­ tive campaign for protective tariffs.
This demonstration (see this volume, pp.
403-04 and 406-08) was joined by the lumpenproletarian elements, who began to be­ have in an unruly manner and loot shops.
The police subsequently arrested Henry Mayers Hyndman, John Burns, Henry Hyde Champion and John Edward Wil­ liams, the leaders of the Federation, on a charge of making 'inciting speeches'.
The trial ended on 10 April with their acquittal.

Harney was not among those arrested; it was at his initiative that a special fund was set up to assist the convicted and their families.
— 404 54 ' On 12 February 1886 Bebel requested Engels to provide him with information on the activities of the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300) and on the events in London (see Note 538), since the German reactionary press was using them as an excuse in support of the need to prolong the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37).
Bebel intended to take part in the discussion of this matter in the Reichstag.
On the letter's first publication in English, see Note 521.

The movement was or­ ganised by certain quarters from the Conservative Party who founded the Fair Trade League that same year.
The League was joined by a small group of trade union officials.

— 409 545 3,500 miners went on strike in Decazeville (department of Aveyron) on 26 (27?) January 1886 in response to the ruthless exploitation to which they were exposed by the owners of the Aveyron Association of Coalmines and Foundries.
At the be­ ginning of the strike, the miners killed Wratrin, the manager of the collieries, who had refused to heed their demands.
The government sent troops to Decazeville.
The strike continued until mid-June and evoked a broad response in France; the events led to the formation in the Chamber of Deputies of a workers' group which supported the miners' demands.
The strike ended in the surrender of the company to the miners; an increased rate was promised, and the obnoxious officials dis­ missed.

—414 548 This is Engels' reply to Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky's letter of 22 February in which she wrote about the forthcoming publication in America of the English translation of his The Condition of the Working-Class in England, the major impor­ tance of this publication for the American workers and the need for translations of other works by Engels.
— 415 549 The Socialist Labor Party of the United States (originally called the Workingmen's Party) was founded at the unification congress held in Philadelphia on 19-22 June 1876 as a result of the merger between the American sections of the First Interna­ tional, led by Friedrich Adolph Sorge and Otto Weydemeyer, and the Labor Party of Illinois and Social Democratic Party, led by Adolph Strasser, A.
Gabriel and Peter J.
McGuire.
However, the party failed to become a mass organisation throughout the country due to the sectarian policies pursued by the leadership which neglected to form links with the mass organisations of the indigenous Ameri­ can proletariat, and due to the predominance of the Lassallean influence in a num­ ber of local organisations.
— 415, 491, 530 550 On the instructions of Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky, the translator of Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in England, R.
Foster — secretary of the Na­ tional Women Suffrage Association — sought a publisher to put out the book in the USA.
She turned to the Executive Committee of the Socialist Labor Party (see Note 549) for help, and on 8 February 1886 the latter set up a special commission for the purpose of negotiating with publishing houses.
However, the negotiations were protracted, and the book was issued in May 1887 without any involvement on the part of the Committee.
— 415, 441 551 On 8 February 1886 Wilhelm Liebknecht took part in the Reichstag discussion of the imperial budget, which provided for financial assistance to the Russian govern­ ment.
Relying on advice from Engels and the material he had sent him, Lieb­ knecht analysed the state of the Russian Empire's finances and stressed that Bis­ marck was rendering it financial assistance in order to help government overcome economic difficulties and prevent them growing into a domestic political crisis (see this volume, pp.
360, 365).

— 420 553 When addressing his letter of 21 December 1885 to Martignetti, Engels mistakenly gave his name as Paolo instead of Pasquale (see this volume, p.
374), which de­ layed delivery.
— 421 554 The Volks-Kalender published in Brunswick in 1878 contained Engels' work 'Karl Marx' (see present edition, Vol.
24) which Pasquale Martignetti was trans­ lating into Italian for publication in one volume together with Marx's Wage Labour and Capital.
Since two pages were stuck together in Martignetti's copy of the Volks-Kalender, he was not able to translate them in full and asked Engels to fill in the missing text in the manuscript sent to him for editing.
— 421, 494 555 On 10 March 1886 Schlüter informed Engels that Dietz had received 1,000 copies of his The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State from the Social-Democratic publishing house in Zurich and provided them with a new title page for sale as the second edition in Germany.
— 422, 475 5 5 6 Hermann Schlüter intended to publish as a separate volume the reports of the Gen­ eral Council to the congresses of the International Working Men's Association and therefore enquired of Engels when and where they had been printed.
He further informed him that 'a translation into Armenian of Marx's Wage Labour and Capital recently appeared in Constantinople'.
— 422 557 On 10 March 1886 Hermann Schlüter informed Engels that he intended to pub­ lish as a separate pamphlet a speech by the Reverend Joseph Stephens, one of the leaders of the Chartist movement, which had been printed in Georg Weerth's arti­ cle 'Joseph Rayner Stephens, Prediger zu Staleybridge, und die Bewegung der en­ glischen Arbeiter im Jahre 1839' contained in Rheinische Jahrbücher zur gesellschaft­ lichen Reform, Herausgegeben unter Mitwirkung Webserer von Hermann Pütt­ mann, Vol.
II, Belle-Vue, near Constanz, 1846.
Schlüter asked Engels to look through the introduction he had written for this publication.
He later changed his plans and published the manuscript anonymously after Engels had looked through it under the title Die Chartistenbewegung in England, Hottingen-Zürich, 1887 (see also Note 453).
—422, 453, 467, 475, 528 558 Engels is replying to Hermann Schlüter's question about when the People's Char­ ter was drawn up.
The purpose of the mass demonstration planned for 10 April 1848 was to present to Parliament the Chartists' third petition supporting the admission of the People's Charter.
Unconfirmed reports said the petition was signed by some five mil­ lion people.
However, the demonstration was prohibited by the government and did not take place.
— 422 559 Engels is probably referring to the article 'French Socialists at the Ballot Box' by A.
S.
Headingley, carried by The Justice, No.
113, 13 March 1886.
The article de­ scribes the Possibilists (see Note 237) as the main socialist organisation in France but fails to mention the formation of a workers' group in the Chamber of Deputies (see this volume, pp.
409-10).
— 424 560 On 18 March 1886 two thousand people gathered in Paris to commemorate the fif­ teenth anniversary of the Paris Commune.
The meeting was addressed by Paul La-fargue, Jules Guesde, Louise Michel, Gabriel Deville and Oury.
Engels sent a let­ ter of greetings which was published in Le Socialiste, No.
31, 27 March 1886 (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
406-07).
— 425 561 In connection with Wilhelm Liebknecht's forthcoming 60th birthday, on 29 March 1886, a group of Social-Democratic deputies in the Reichstag (Ignaz Auer, August Bebel, Paul Singer and others) proposed setting up a fund to assist him and his family.
Bebel attached the group's appeal to his letter to Engels of 9 March and requested him to make his contribution.
— 426 562 At the sitting of 18 February 1886 in the Reichstag Paul Singer exposed Ferdinand Ihring, an employee of the police criminal investigation department, who had in-Notes 623 filtrated a workers' society in Berlin under the name of Mahlow and incited the workers to carry out acts of terrorism for the purpose of provocation.
— 426 563 This probably refers to Wilhelm Liebknecht's speech at the workers' meeting on 8 March 1886 in Berlin.
Liebknecht rebuffed the claims by government circles that the Anti-Socialist Law was of an 'educative significance' for the Social Democrats and exposed the attempts to pass off the introduction of a state monopoly on spirits as a 'socialist' measure.
— 427 564 The Chamber of Deputies passed the resolution on 15 March 1886 by 379 votes to 100.
—428 565 On 17 March 1886 Paul Lafargue wrote to Engels that Benoît Malon, one of the Possibilist (see Note 237) leaders, was seeking to set up a parliamentary group made up of socialists of all complexions except those who were 'too red'.
— 430 566 On 1 March 1886 La Nouvelle Revue, whose editor-in-chief was Juliette Adam, published Paul Lafargue's article 'Le Matriarcat.
.
.
'.
On 17 March 1886 he wrote to Engels, 'You will have received the copy of La Nouvelle Revue which I sent you yesterday.
So as to correspond to the magazine's level of publications I have made the theoretical part much shorter; in the proofs Mme Adam has abridged it even more.
.
.
However one should not blame her since she has dropped rather serious things which would have shocked brave philistines who subscribe to it.
The prud­ ery of the Parisian journals is incredible.

' — 431 567 In 1884 the Journal des Economistes.
Revue de la science économique et de la statistique carried the following articles by Lafargue: in Nos.
7 and 8, 'Le blé en Amérique, production et commerce'; in No.
9, 'La théorie de la plus-value de Karl Marx et la critique de M.
Paul Leroy-Beaulieu'; in No.
11, 'Le "Capital" de Karl Marx et la critique de M.

— 431 569 On 18 March 1886 South Place Chapel in London was the venue for a meeting to commemorate the anniversary of the Paris Commune.
The meeting was addressed by representatives of the Socialist League (see Note 346) (Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Frank Kitz and others), the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 300) (Tom Mann, Harry Quelch and others), Friedrich Lessner from the German Workers' Educational Society (see Note 162) and also a number of anarchists, including Pyotr Kropotkin.
— 431 5'° In her letter of reply written in April 1886, Vera Zasulich thanked Engels for send­ ing her the Russian translation of the second volume of Capital and gave her pre­ cise address: 'Madame Beldinsky, Maison Goss-Renevier, Chemin de la Queue d'Arve, Plain palais, Genève.
' — 432 571 The reference is to the Reichstag repeated debates on the prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law held on 30 and 31 March and 2 April 1886.
Engels is alluding to the bold interventions by the leaders of the German Social Democrats.
Speaking on 31 March, for example, August Bebel stated that the government would not require any anti-socialist law if it was in a position to halt the proletarianisation of the masses but — since it was not in a position to do so — no anti-socialist laws would help it.
In his speech of 2 April Wilhelm Liebknecht severely criticised Bismarck's speech in which he had accused Bebel of advocating terror, and compared Bis­ marck's regime with that of the Second Empire in France.
On 2 April 1886 the Anti-Socialist Law was prolonged for two years at the third reading by 169 votes to 137.
—433, 437, 442 572 Engels is quoting from a popular satirical song dating from 1844-45.
Tschech's At­ tentat relates to the unsuccessful attempt on the life of Frederick William IV staged on 26 July 1844 by H.
L.
Tschech, the mayor of Storkow.
The second song, Freifrau von Droste-Vischering, is a parody directed against the Catholic clergy in Trier.
— 434 573 In the Reichstag discussion on the prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law on 31 March 1886, Bismarck turned to August Bebel and said that, although he could not prove that Marx had engaged in 'training murderers', Ferdinand Blind — who had made an attempt on his life on 7 May 1866 — was a pupil of Marx.
At Engels' insistence, Laura Lafargue and Eleanor Marx-Aveling made a statement on the matter in which they categorically rejected this false allegation.
The statement was published in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
16, 15 April 1886 and reprinted in Le Socia­ liste, No.
35, 24 April 1886.
—435, 437 574 Engels is referring to the formation of a workers' group in the French Chamber of Deputies (see this volume, pp.
409-10 and 413).
— 437 575 The reference is to the sentence passed by the criminal court in Villefranche on 17 April 1886 on the socialists Ernest Roche and Albert Duc-Quercy.
As special cor­ respondents of L'Intransigeant and Le Cri du Peuple during the strike at Decazeville (see Note 545), they had been arrested there on a charge of inciting acts of violence and the organised downing of tools.
Roche and Duc-Quercy were each sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.
— 438, 442 576 The reference is to the by-elections to the Chamber of Deputies held in Paris on 2 May 1886.
The socialist parties and groups (with the exception of the Possibilists, see Note 237) put forward Ernest Roche as their candidate, whilst the Radicals no­ minated Alfred Nicholas Gaulier.
Roche received 100,000 votes, and Gaulier 146,000.
At the previous elections on 4 October 1885 the socialist vote had been over 35,500.
At the poll to elect part of the Paris municipal council on 31 October 1886 the socialist candidate Duc-Quercy received 901 votes, whilst Faillet collected 988 votes for the Possibilists.
—438, 442, 444, 446, 470 577 In May 1886, The Commonweal started to appear weekly instead of monthly.
Ed­ ward Aveling used this as an occasion to leave the editorial board which was in­ creasingly being influenced by anarchist ideas.
Aveling's letter of resignation was made public in the first weekly issue (No.
16) of 1 May 1886.
The letter merely said that 'the necessary demands of a weekly on an editor's time can only be met by those in relatively more fortunate positions'.
Thereafter Aveling contributed to The Commonweal from time to time on a freelance basis.

16, 15 April 1886 carried a re­ port on the speech made in the Reichstag on 2 April by manufacturers' association president Fritz Kalle during the debate on the prolongation of the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 571).
Kalle claimed that the Social Democrats aspired to the 'com-munality of wives' (Weibergemeinschaft) and quoted in a distorted manner from the Manifesto of the Communist Party to back up his claim.
At the same sitting Wil­ helm Liebknecht sharply rebuffed Kalle and provided documentary evidence to show that the quotation was not from Marx, but from Pastor Schuster.
— 438 '9 Engels is referring to Pionier.
Illustrirter Volks-Kalender für 1886, New York, which carried a biographical article entitled 'Aus dem Leben eines alten Sozialde­ mokraten' about Carl Daniel Adolph Douai, a German socialist who had partici­ pated in the 1848 revolution and was living as an émigré in the United States.
— 440 10 The reference is to the critical remarks about the style of the second volume of Cap­ ital which Friedrich Adolph Sorge received from a German socialist emigre in the United States and communicated to Engels in his letter of 28 February 1886.
— 440 1 ' Engels is referring to the mass campaign for the eight-hour working day which de­ veloped in major centres of US industry (Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh, Cinci-natti, St Louis, Boston, Baltimore, Milwaukee) in the spring of 1886.
The cam­ paign culminated in a general strike and mass demonstrations on 1 May 1886 in­ volving over 350,000 people.
Almost 200,000 workers secured a shorter working day as a result.
— 441, 452 12 In the spring of 1886 the United States witnessed a mass proletarian campaign for the eight-hour working day (see Note 581).
Up to 65,000 people went on strike in Chicago in the first days of May.
Workers clashed with police at a meeting held on 3 May.
During the following day's protest meeting in Haymarket Square an agent provocateur threw a bomb which exploded and killed seven policemen and four workers.
The police opened fire on the crowd, as a result of which a number were killed and over 200 wounded.
Mass arrests were carried out and the leaders of the Chicago Labor Union brought before the court.
Despite the broad campaign in defence of the accused in the United States and a number of European countries, four of them — Albert R.
Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fischer and George En-gel— were hanged on 11 November 1887 on the decision of the US Supreme Court.
In memory of the events of 1886 in Chicago, the International Socialists' Con­ gress held in Paris in 1889 resolved to proclaim 1 May International Workers' Day.

H.
Nestler und Melle asking him to edit the 'Handbibliothek der Sozial-Oekonomie' which they were planning to issue.
The edition was to be a series of pamphlets containing statements on social issues by prominent academics.
The letter was first published abridged in English in: K.

— 447 4 The debates on the Irish Arms Bill to which Engels refers occurred at the second reading in the House of Commons on 20 May 1886.
The purpose of the bill was to prolong the ban on the sale, carrying and importation of arms for certain areas of Notes Ireland which had been instituted with The Peace Preservation (Ireland) Act of 1881.
In his substantiation of the bill, John Morley, Secretary of State for Ireland, said that it was particularly important in the North of Ulster, where an overt campaign for the organisation of resistance to the introduction of Irish Home Rule was being carried on among the Protestant population (Englishmen).
Randolph Churchill set out to show that these steps were legitimate by referring to Lord Althorp and Sir Robert Peel, who in 1833 had spoken of a possible justification for civil war should a threat emerge to the integrity of the British Empire.
In his reply, Glad­ stone accused Churchill of supporting resistance to government measures.
The bill was adopted in the House of Commons by 303 votes to 89.
The material which Engels sent and the ideas expressed in his letter formed the basis for the leading article 'Das Recht zur Rebellion' in Der Sozialdemokrat, No.

—448 585 On the eve of the by-elections to the Chamber of Deputies in Paris (see Note 576) Justice, No.
120, 1 May 1886 carried an item by A.
S.
Headingley headed 'The So­ cialists and the Paris Elections' in support of the position taken by the Possibilists (see Note 237).
They had declined to support the candidature of Ernest Roche which had been put forward by the Workers' Party (see Note 201) together with all the other socialist groups and had nominated their own candidate in the shape of a working miner named Soubrié.
In response to this, Eleanor Marx-Aveling published a short note in The Commonweal, No.
18, 15 May 1886 stating that one of its coming issues would carry an article by Lafargue about the strike in Decaze-ville (see Note 545) and the Paris elections.
Lafargue did, indeed, write such an ar­ ticle, which was carried by The Commonweal, No.
22, 12 June 1886 under the heading 'The Decazeville Strike'; the article explained that the Possibilists' posi­ tion had facilitated the victory of the bourgeois candidate.
— 450 58 6 -phe seconcj annual conference of the Socialist League, held at 13 Farringdon Road on 13 June 1886 with 19 delegates attending, revealed a growth in disag­ reements between the anarchist-influenced supporters of 'direct action' and the proponents of a struggle by parliamentary means.
— 451 587 Engels' reference to the collapse of the Decazeville strike (see Note 545) is evi­ dently based on incorrect sources, possibly the report by Le Socialiste, No.
38, 15 May 1886 that the strike was nearing its end.
In reality the strike did not end until mid-June.
— 451 588 Engels is replying to Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky's letter of 31 May 1886 in which she informed him that she had sent him the manuscript and proofs of the 'Appendix to the American Edition of The Condition of the Working Class in Eng­ land 1, wrote about the quality of the print of Engels' book and the importance for the American reader of its publication.

— 453 590 Engels was on holiday in Eastbourne approximately from 25 June to 7 July 1886.
—454, 455 591 The British parliament was dissolved on 26 June 1886.
The elections to the House of Commons began on 2 July and were not completed before 20 July 1886.
They brought defeat for the Liberals, who obtained 191 seats as against 316 for the Con-servatives, 78 for the Liberal Unionists (see Note 430), and 85 for the supporters of Home Rule in Ireland.
— 454 592 On 3 July 1886 Kautsky wrote to tell Engels that he had been visited by Mrs Guil-laume-Schack who wished to see him in Eastbourne.
She obtained Engels' address and wrote the same day asking him to receive her.
— 455 593 Becker wrote to Engels on 18-22 June 1886 suggesting that they meet in the au­ tumn in Paris where he intended to visit the family of his eldest daughter.

— 458 59' Engels wrote this letter on a postcard addressed: 'F.
A.
Sorge, Esq.
in Hoboken, JV.
T.
, U.
S.
America.
' The address was crossed out by an unknown hand and re­ placed with 'Mt.
Desert, Maine'.
It follows from Sorge's letter to Engels of 20 July 1886 that at this time Sorge and his wife were on holiday in Mount Desert (Maine), a small island in the north-east of the United States.
— 460 598 The reference is to the interview which Engels gave to J.
T.
McEnnis, a correspon­ dent for The Missouri Republican (see this volume, p.
443).
Following the publica­ tion of the interview, Sorge placed in the New Torker Volkszeitung, No.
162, 8 July 1886 the statement sent to him by Engels (see present edition, Vol.
26, p.
408).
— 460-61, 491 599 Engels was on holiday in Eastbourne from 7 August to 4 September 1886.
— 460, 466-67, 471, 475, 477-79, 482, 488, 491 600 At the invitation of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Labor Party (see Note 549) Wilhelm Liebknecht took part in a campaign tour of the United States to raise money for the German Social Democrats' election fund.
Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling made a trip around the United States at approxima­ tely the same time (see Note 601).
Liebknecht stayed in Eastbourne with Engels for four days, left Liverpool on 4 September and arrived in New York on 13 Septem­ ber where he met the Avelings.
In New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, Chi­ cago, Pittsburgh, Washington and other cities he gave talks and lectures on the theory and history of socialism, the state of the workers' movement in Europe and other subjects.
This trip, which he completed on 26 November, raised 16,000 marks for the German Social Democrats' election fund.
On his way back to Germany, Liebknecht stayed with Engels in London from 5 to 10 December, fol­ lowing which he set off on his way home to Borsdorf near Leipzig.
— 461,.
469, 478, 480, 483, 489, 496, 500, 531, 535 60 ' Like Wilhelm Liebknecht, Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling toured the Notes United States giving lectures and talks at the invitation of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Labor Party (see Note 549).
They left Liverpool on 31 August and arrived in New York on 10 September.
Their trip was a great success, ending on 25 December.
On 4 January 1887 the Avelings returned to London.
In early 1887 they gave numerous lectures and talks on the labour movement in the United States to a working-class audience in London.
— 461, 478, 494, 496, 506, 525, 536, 540 602 As a re-examination of a sentence passed by a court in Chemnitz (see Note 446), a new trial began on 25 July 1886 in Freiberg (Saxony) of a group of leading fig­ ures in the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.
On 4 August 1886 the local provin­ cial court sentenced Ignaz Auer, August Bebel, Carl Ulrich, Louis Viereck, Georg Heinrich von Vollmar and Karl Franz Egon Frohme to nine months', as well as Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz, Philipp Heinrich Müller and Stefan Heinzel, to six months' imprisonment on a charge of belonging to a 'secret society'.
Bebel ser­ ved his prison sentence in Zwickau from mid-November 1886 to 14 August 1887.
— 461, 468, 482, 500, 502, 511 603 On 3 August 1886 Karl Kautsky informed Engels that from that autumn Victor Adler was planning to publish a socialist weekly in Vienna which he wished to put at the party's disposal.
Adler published the socialist weekly Gleichheit from Decem­ ber 1886 to June 1889.
—461 604 This is Engels' reply to the request made by Kautsky in his letter of 9 August 1886 that Engels look through the manuscript of the book Karl Marx's Oekonomische Lehren which he was preparing for the press at the time (see also Note 137).
Engels read the manuscript in the first half of September and made a number of remarks which the author took into account when publishing the book.
— 462 605 This evidently refers to the Italian translation of Marx's Wage Labour and Capital and Hermann Schlüter's work on the history of the Chartist movement (see Note 557).
—462 606 There was no English translation of The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State made during Engels' lifetime.
— 464 607 The substance of this letter by Engels was used in the editorial carried by Der So­ zialdemokrat, No.
34, 18 August 1886.

-468, 490 609 "pjjg Knights of Labor (The Noble Order of the Knights of Labour) is the name of an American workers' organisation founded in Philadelphia in 1869 and constituting a secret society until 1881.
The bulk of the members of the 'Order' were unskilled workers, including a large number of Blacks.
Its aims were to set up cooperatives and organise mutual assistance, and it took part in a considerable number of work­ ing-class campaigns.
However, the leadership of the 'Order' to all intents and purposes rejected the idea of workers' taking part in political struggle and advo­ cated cooperation between classes.
In 1886 the leadership worked against the general strike, forbidding its members to take part.
Rank-and-file members of the 'Order' nevertheless did so, and after this the 'Order' began to lose influence among the working masses, falling apart by the end of the 1890s.
— 470, 491, 525, 530, 532, 541 629 610 During the run-up to the elections for the Chamber of Deputies on 2 May 1886 (see Note 576) the socialist organisations and groups who had put forward Ernest Roche set up an election committee.
After the elections, the leadership of the So­ cialist Federation of the department of Seine published an official report on the meeting of 9 May 1886 in Le Socialiste, No.
38, 15 May.
It was announced in the report that the committee members had decided to maintain the coalition of these organisations and groups and had set up a standing commission including among its members Paul Lafargue from the Paris organisation of the Workers' Party.
— 470 611 A fragment of this letter was first published in English in: K.
Marx, F.
Engels, On Reactionary Prussianism, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1943.
— 472 6,2 In the letter referred to Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz suggested to Kautsky that, for the duration of the six months' imprisonment to which he had been sen­ tenced by the court in Freiberg (see Note 602), Wilhelm Bios should be entrusted with editing Die Neue %eil in Stuttgart (Kautsky had just done the general editing of the journal from London).
Kautsky sent this letter to Engels on 19 August, ask­ ing his opinion on the matter and requesting permission to publish his name on the list of the journal's regular contributors in the prospectus for 1887.
— 472 613 Engels is referring to the following event: On 25 July 1886 the police in Amster­ dam had tried to break up a traditional fete on the grounds that its participants were playing a forbidden game known as 'eel-snatching'.
The police action met with considerable resistance, and clashes continued until the following day.
Sever­ al dozen people were killed and an even greater number injured.
Government bo­ dies and the press used these events to launch a provocative campaign against the Socialist Party.
Persecution began on a massive scale, a number of socialists were arrested and brought before the court.
— 473 6 ' * The reference is to the parcel from Swan Sonnenschein & C ° publishers which was addressed to Engels in London and forwarded by Karl Kautsky to the recipient in Eastbourne.
— 473 6 '5 Engels is evidently referring to the General Council reports which Schlüter planned to publish as a separate volume (see Note 556).
— 475 616 Engels wrote this letter on a postcard addressed: 'K.
Kautsky Esq.
, 50, Maitland Park Road, N.
W.
London.
' —476 6 ' ' On 23 August Karl Kautsky wrote to Engels that Wilhelm Liebknecht had asked him to purchase an easel which he could hang around his neck by means of a belt and on which he could write whether standing or walking.
(Play on words: Esel meant both 'ass' and 'easel'.
)—477 6 '8 On 16 August 1886 Gertrud Guillaume-Schack informed Engels that she intended to come to London in mid-September in the company of the Wischnewetzkys.
— 477, 478 6 '9 The reference is to the strike by the workers at the Vierzon (department of Cher) factory of the Société française de construction de matériel agricole which began on 4 August 1886 in response to the dismissal of some of them due to the crisis in the engineering industry.
The events in Vierzon were widely reflected in the French press, as Laura Lafargue wrote in her letter to Engels of 20 August 1886.
— 478, 489, 507 620 On 25 August 1886 George Julian Harney informed Engels that he had intended to visit him in Eastbourne on 29 August but was no longer able to do so due to changed circumstances.
On 26 August, Harney sent two consecutive letters to let Engels know he would visit him in London.

'— 480 622 The Mew Yorker Volkszeitung, No.
200, 21 August 1886 carried an item headed 'Ein Bedürfniß und eine Schmach' expressing surprise at the lack of a complete English translation of Volume I of Capital.
It stated that the translation being printed by To-Day (see Note 527) could not meet with the readers' satisfaction since it was being published in numerous short parts.
The author of the item de­ scribed this situation as disgraceful and suggested that the funds for an English edi­ tion of Capital might be obtained from some well-to-do Social Democrat.
— 480 623 In the letter referred to, the Hamburg publishers F.
H.
Nestler und Melle ac­ cused Engels, once he had refused to edit the 'Handbibliothek der Sozial-Oekono-mie' (see this volume, p.
448 and Note 583), of having passed on the offer to Karl Kautsky and then Die Neue 2^eit.
Dietz's publishing house was advertising the forthcoming appearance of a series called 'Klassiker der Nationalökonomie und des Sozialismus', whilst Kautsky had also been planning a similar edition for some considerable time.
— 481 624 Engels is referring to the trial of Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue, Etienne Suisini and Louise Michel for the speeches they had made in the Théâtre du Château-d'Eau on 3 June 1886.
The trial took place on 12 August 1886, but Guesde, Lafargue and Suisini refused to appear before the court, so that only Louise Michel was present.
All four of them were sentenced to terms of imprisonment between four and six months and fined 100 francs.
On 24 September 1886 Guesde, Lafargue and Suisini appealed against the court's decision and all four were acquitted.
— 483, 494 625 Engels analysed Bismarck's relations with Russia in his letter to Paul Lafargue of 25-26 October 1866 (see this volume, pp.
512-18) which was subsequently pub­ lished as an article entitled 'The Political Situation in Europe' (see present edition, Vol.
26).
—483, 488, 493 626 Engels is apparently referring to the article 'Haben wir etwas mit den Anarchisten gemein?' carried by Vorbote, the weekly supplement to the Chicagoer Arbeiter-Leitung, on 9 June 1886.
—491 62' In his letter of 10-11 August 1886 Sorge informed Engels that the Reverend J.
G.
Brooks from Brockton near Boston (Massachusetts) had asked for Edward Aveling and Eleanor Marx-Aveling to visit him during their tour of the United States.
Brooks promised them the opportunity to address a large working-class au­ dience.
— 491 628 From 17 to 28 September 1886 Johann Philipp Becker stayed with Engels in Lon­ don, and from 29 September to 4 October with the Lafargues in Paris.
— 495, 498, 501 629 An allusion to the following passage in Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bo-naparte: 'The French bourgeoisie had long ago found the solution to Napoleon's di­ lemma: "Dans cinquante ans, l'Europe sera républicaine ou cosaque.
" It had found the solution to it in the "république cosaque" ' (the words are taken from the book: Las Cases, Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène, ou journal où se trouve consigné, jour par jour, ce qu'a dit et fait Napoléon durant dix-huit mois, Paris, 1823-24) (see present edition, Vol.
11, p.
182).
—496 630 In his letter to Engels of 30 September 1886 Paul Lafargue described the acquittal at his trial (see Note 624) as a manifestation of the fact that 'the bourgeois have ri­ pened to appreciate some part of our theories'.
— 497 631 At that time Johann Philipp Becker was a contributor to Deutsch-Italienische Kor­ respondenz published by Franz Julius Schneeberger in Vienna.
— 499, 501 632 As an émigré in Paris, in 1857 Becker engaged in applied chemistry; an explosion occurred during one of his experiments.
— 499, 501 633 The reference is to Eduard Bernstein's letter to Engels of 17 September 1886.
— 500 634 The reference is to the political crisis which emerged in Bulgaria in the autumn of 1886 after Prince Alexander Battenberg was toppled from the throne by a group of military conspirators associated with the secret service of the Russian government.
The interim government set up on 9 August survived for just a few days and was replaced by a pro-Austrian regency.
An attempt to restore Alexander Battenberg to the throne was unsuccessful, meeting with overt Russian resistance.
In Septem­ ber 1886, the Russian government sent Major-General Nikolai Kaulbars to Sofia with the mission of preparing the ground for the installation of a Russian candi­ date on the Bulgarian throne.
The mission was unsuccessful, pardy due to the posi­ tion taken by the West European powers, notably Britain.
On 5 November Kaul­ bars was recalled and the government of the Russian Empire broke off diplomatic relations with Bulgaria (see also Note 445).
— 503, 505, 517 635 The reference is to August Bebel's letter to Engels of 12 October 1886.
— 504 636 Several newspapers reported that the supporters of Dragan Zankoff, the leader of Bulgaria's liberal party, had spread rumours to the effect that the Russian govern­ ment had concluded a secret agreement with Turkey.
They alleged that the agree­ ment guaranteed the inviolability of the Sultan's possessions and reduced the out­ standing war debt to be paid by the Turks in return for the right to set up Russian fortifications in the Dardanelles.
— 505 637 The Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi was signed by Russia and Turkey on 8 July 1833.
It provided for mutual aid in the event of war with a third power.
A secret article in the treaty freed Turkey from the obligation to give military aid to Russia in return for an undertaking to close the Straits to all foreign men-of-war on Russia's de­ mand.
— 505 638 The reference is to the bombardment of Alexandria by the British Navy under Ad­ miral Beauchamp Seymour on 11 July 1882.
It represented one of the crucial ac­ tions carried out by the British in their quest to colonise Egypt.
Following the sei-sure of Alexandria on 2 August, units of the Anglo-Indian army occupied the Suez Canal zone, and on 15 September Cairo was taken.
Whilst nominally remaining a part of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt was actually turned into a British colony.
Notes The British colonisers' penetration into the Sudan from the early 1870s met with stiff resistance from the local people; an uprising of national liberation in 1881 drove British forces from almost the entire country.
An independent centralised state was formed in the course of the uprising, and the British did not manage to break the Sudanese until 1899.
—505 639 It was announced in Vienna in early October 1886 that the police had uncovered an 'anarchist conspiracy', allegedly to organise fires and explosions in various parts of the city with the aim of creating panic among the public.
It was also reported that the police had found a number of caches with explosives and side-arms; some 20 people were arrested as a result.
— 507 640 The first national congress of the French trade unions was held in Lyons from 11 to 17 October 1886, with representatives of more than 700 trade councils (chambres syndicales) taking part.
The congress adopted a resolution recognising that the ge­ nuine liberation of the proletariat was not to be had by way of cooperation, profit-sharing for workers and similar measures, as proposed by the bourgeoisie, but only through the abolition of private property and its replacement by collective, social property, through the socialisation of the means of production.
The congress also adopted a resolution on the need to campaign for an eight-hour working day and on the establishment of a National Federation of Trade Unions (La Fédération natio­ nale des Syndicats).
Commenting on the outcome of the congress in his letter to Engels of 22 Oc­ tober 1886, Paul Lafargue wrote that 'the congress in Lyons will be a crucial means for attracting the French workers to communism'.
— 507 641 The events in Vierzon (see Note 619) and Henry Maret's interpellation about the dispersal of a strikers' demonstration by gendarmes on 5 October and the arrest of demonstrators meant that Internal Affairs Minister Jean Sarrien was forced to re­ sign on 18 October 1886.
This coincided with the announcement of Finance Minis­ ter Sadi Carnot's resignation and raised the danger of a government crisis.
How­ ever, President Jules Grévy and Prime Minister Charles de Freycinet were success­ ful in persuading both ministers to withdraw their resignations.
— 507 642 The reference is to the statement by the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag that Der Sozialdemokrat was no longer to be called the party's official printed or­ gan; on 5 November 1886 the newspaper started to appear with the subheading 'Organ der Sozialdemokratie deutscher Zunge' (Organ of Social Democracy in the German tongue).
This decision was occasioned by the confirmation on the part of the criminal chamber of the imperial court of the sentence imposed by the Saxon provincial court in Freiberg against a group of German Social-Democratic leaders on 4 August 1886 (see Note 602).
They were accused of belonging to a 'secret society', the grounds behind the accusation including their links with Der Sozialdemokrat which carried the subheading 'Zentral-Organ der deutschen Sozialdemokratie' (Central Organ of German Social Democracy).
— 509 6 4 3 Engels is referring to Die Neue Zeit, No.
11,1886, which carried August Bebel's arti­ cle 'Deutschland, Rußland und die orientalische Frage'.
In his letter of 12 October 1886 Bebel expressed the view that one of the reasons for Bismarck's efforts to achieve a rapprochement with Russia was his fear that a European war might give rise to social upheavals.
— 509 644 In his speech of 20 May 1886 to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies, the National Liberal Louis Berger stated that he and his friends did not expect the establishment of a liberal cabinet and were prepared to content themselves with a moderate con­ servative one.
August Bebel wrote to Engels on 12 October that, if the liberals came to power, all their 'opposition' to the present regime would come to an end.
—510 645 This letter was published slightly abridged and with editorial alterations as an ar­ ticle headed 'Situation politique de l'Europe' in Le Socialiste, No.
63, 6 November 1886 (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
410-17).
On its first publication in English, see Note 196.
— 512 646 The preliminary Peace Treaty of San Stefano, which ended the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78, was concluded on 3 March (February 19) 1878 at the place of the same name near Constantinople.
It provided for the establishment of an autonomous Bulgarian principality with nominal dependence on Turkey; for state independ­ ence for Serbia, Montenegro and Romania and their territorial enlargement, etc.
The treaty considerably strengthened Russian influence in the Balkans and gave rise to sharp opposition from Britain and Austria-Hungary with the tacit support of Germany.
Under diplomatic and military pressure, the Russian government was forced to agree to an international congress to reconsider the treaty, given that it concerned 'general European' issues.
The congress was held in Berlin from 13 June to 13 July 1878 and attended by representatives of Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, France, Britain, Italy and Turkey.
The outcome was the Treaty of Ber­ lin, which represented a major deterioration in the conditions of the Treaty of San Stefano for Russia and the Slavs of the Balkan Peninsula.
The size of self-governing Bulgaria was reduced to less than half that specified in San Stefano; an auto­ nomous province — Eastern Rumelia — was set up under the Sultan's rule in the parts of Bulgaria located south of the Balkans; the size of Montenegro was consi­ derably reduced.
The Treaty of Berlin endorsed the return to Russia ofthat part of Bessarabia which had been cut off from it in 1856 and at the same time sanctioned the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary.
— 512 647 The suppression of the Polish national insurrection (1794) was followed, in 1795, by the third partition of Poland between Austria, Prussia and Russia, and the final abolition of the Polish state.
By a decision of the Vienna Congress (1814-15), the Kingdom of Poland was established as part of the Russian Empire and included a large part of the lands seized by Prussia and Austria in the third partition of Rzecz Pospolita.
— 512 648 In the 1870s, Britain and France, Egypt's main creditors, used the Egyptian gov­ ernment's financial difficulties, notably its large external debts, to impose their fi­ nancial control on the country.
This led in the 1880s to a growth in the national li­ beration movement and efforts by the Egyptians to free themselves from depend­ ence on foreign powers.
In the summer of 1882, Britain provoked a conflict with Egypt, took military action and seized the country, turning it into a British colony to all intents and purposes (see also Note 638).
— 514 649 Welcoming Alexander III back from the Crimea at a meeting in Moscow on 25 May 1886, Nikolai Alexeyev, the mayor of the city, stated: 'Our hope gains wings, Notes and strength is imparted to our belief that the Cross of Christ will shine upon St Sophia' (Alexeyev was referring to St Sophia's Church in Constantinople).
— 516 650 The Congress of Vienna was held by European monarchs and their ministers in Sep­ tember 1814-June 1815.
They established the borders and status of the Euro­ pean states after the victory over Napoleonic France and sanctioned, contrary to the national interests and will of the peoples, the reshaping of Europe's political map and the restoration of the 'legitimate' dynasties.
— 519 651 In Das Recht auf den vollen Arbeitsertrag in geschichtlicher Darstellung, which ap­ peared in 1886, the Austrian sociologist and lawyer Anton Menger set out to prove the 'unoriginality' of Marx's economic theory, claiming he had borrowed some of his conclusions from the English Utopian socialists of the Ricardian school (Thompson, etc.
).
Laura Lafargue wrote to Engels on 30 October 1886, informing him of the book's appearance.
Feeling that if he personally was to oppose Menger in public, the latter might use this to boost his image, Engels thought it expedient to rebuff Menger with an editorial in Die Neue £eit or a résumé of the book in the name of Karl Kautsky, the editor of the said journal.
Engels originally intended to write the bulk of the article himself, but was unable to continue his work on it due to illness.
The article was completed by Kautsky in line with Engels' instructions.
It appeared unsigned in Die Neue Zeit, No.
2, 1887 and was headed 'Juristen-Sozialismus' (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
597-616).
— 521, 527 652 The reference is to I, Part I; I, Part V; II, Part VI of the third volume of Capital (see present edition, Vol.
37).
— 522 653 This letter is Engels' reply to a certain E.
T.
who had published in The Common­ weal an item called 'Socialisme utopique et socialisme scientifique' containing the following: 'Please say if there is an English translation of Engels' "Socialisme Utop­ ique et Socialisme Scientifique".
If not, do you know if Engels has given permission to any particular person to translate it; and is there any likelihood in that case of its being issued shortly? Or is it open to any one who wishes to translate it into En­ glish, to do so?' — 523 654 Engels is probably referring to Marx's prefaces to the first and second editions of Volume I of Capital, which were included in the English edition, and also his own preface to this edition.
— 524 65.
5 This seems to refer to letters by Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling who were on a tour of the United States with Wilhelm Liebknecht at the time (see Note 601).
—524 656 Paul Lafargue signed his articles in La Nouvelle Revue with the pseudonym 'Fergus'.
— 524 657 Engels is referring to the election for the mayor of New York which took place on 2 November 1886.
Henry George, the candidate from the United Labor Party, re­ ceived 68,110 votes, or 31 per cent of the poll.
Workers' candidates were elected in Chicago, Milwaukee, Stanton and other cities.
The United Labor Parly was formed in the run-up to the New York municipal elec­ tions in the autumn of 1886 to promote joint political action on the part of the work­ ing class.
The initiative for its foundation was taken by the Central Labor Union of New York, an association of the city's trade unions established in March 1882.
Following the New York example, similar parties were set up in other cities, including Baltimore, Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, etc.
— 525, 531 658 A special meeting of the General Council of the Social Democratic Federation on Tuesday (October 5) decided to call on the unemployed of London to follow the Lord Mayor's Show on 9 November 1886.
The authorities banned all demon­ strations in the vicinity of the procession and deployed a large number of police in the area.
The leadership of the Federation nevertheless held a meeting in Trafalgar Square on 9 November without any of the rioting and disorder the authorities did so much to provoke.
On 21 November the greatest working-class demonstration ever seen in London was held in Trafalgar Square.
The demonstration, with tens of thousands participating, passed off without any incidents and contributed to a certain growth in the authority the Federation enjoyed among working people in London.
—526, 534 659 The Radical Clubs began to appear in London and other cities during the 1870s.
They united bourgeois radicals and workers.
The proletarian element was predo­ minant in the poorest areas of the capital, like the East End.
The clubs were dis­ tinctive for the fact that they criticised Gladstone's policy on Ireland and called for greater democracy (extension of the suffrage and other reforms).
Socialist ideas were spread in the Radical Clubs from the early 1880s.
In 1885 the Radical Clubs in London merged to form the Metropolitan Radical Federation.
— 526, 529 660 Engels is referring to the bourgeois press' attacks on Marx which were directly oc­ casioned by the pamphlet: K.
Vogt, Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Leitung.
Ste­ nographischer Bericht.
Dokumente und Erläuterungen.
Published in Geneva in Decem­ ber 1859, it was directed against Marx and his associates in the Communist League.
Marx exposed Vogt's attacks in his work Herr Vogt (see present edition, Vol.
17).
—527 661 A fragment of this letter was first published in English in: K.
Marx, F.

— 528 662 On 4 November 1886 Schlüter wrote to Engels informing him of the successful conclusion of talks with Johann Philipp Becker on the granting of material assis­ tance in return for his writing his memoirs (see this volume, pp.
498-500).
The plan did not materialise as Becker died on 7 December 1886.
— 528 663 This is Engels' reply to the suggestion made by Schlüter that he revise three chap­ ters' from the second part of Anti-Diihring for publication as a separate pamphlet under the title The Theory of Force.
They contain an exposition of the materialist views of the correlation between economics and politics.
Engels subsequently chan­ ged his plans and decided to add a fourth chapter giving concrete form to the main propositions using the example of the history of Germany from 1848 to 1888 and analysing them from the viewpoint of a critique of Bismarck's policies.
The pam­ phlet was to be called The Role of Force in History.
Engels worked on the fourth chapter at a later date, between late December 1887 and March 1888, but did not complete it.
The unfinished work, as well as various plans and fragments, were not published until after Engels' death (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
452-510, 511, 578-80).
—529 664 The reference is to the article 'On Social Relations in Russia' from the Refugee Li­ terature series, published in Der Volksstaat from 1874 to 1875 (see present edition, Notes Vol.
24, pp.
3-50); this article also appeared as a separate pamphlet in late June-early July 1875 in Leipzig.
The third and fourth articles of the series to which En-gels refers did not have any titles of their own.
Schlüter's plans to publish a pamphlet Soziales aus Rußland were not carried out at the time.
The first, second and fifth articles in the series, together with an afterword specially written by Engels ('Afterword (1894) to On Social Relations in Russia*, present edition, Vol.
27) appeared as a collection of articles by Engels published in Berlin in 1894 as Internationales aus dem 'Volksstaat' (1871-75).

— 531 666 In late November 1886 a Leipzig jury court sentenced the joiner and Social Demo­ crat Karl Schumann to four years' and several others to various terms of imprison­ ment on a charge of'insurrection'.
They were accused on the strength of the seeing-off ceremony which Leipzig workers organised for Schumann on 25 September 1886 in connection with his expulsion from the city under the Anti-Socialist Law (see Note 37).
—534 667 Engels wrote this letter on a postcard addressed: 'Herrn H.
Schlüter, Volksbuch­ handlung, Casinostraße, Hottingen-Zürich, Switzerland.
' — 535 668 Schlüter wrote to Engels on 4 December 1886 describing his plans to reissue En-gels' pamphlet The Bakuninists at Work together with his article 'On Social Rela­ tions in Russia' as an issue in the Sozialdemokratische Bibliothek series (see Note 664).
Schlüter further wrote about Eduard Bernstein's proposal that this issue be supplied with a preface from the publishers.
— 535 669 This apparently refers to the English translation of Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in England made by Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky (see Note 550).
—535 670 On 28 November 1886 Laura Lafargue wrote to Engels saying that she would be arriving in London on 23 or 24 December.
— 536 671 Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky wrote to Engels on 10 December 1886 asking him to write a preface to the American edition of her translation of The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (see Note 550).
She explained that the after­ word Engels had written for this edition in February 1886 had become outdated and asked him to concentrate in the new preface on a critique of Henry George's doctrine, notably his plan for land reform.
In the same letter Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky asked Engels whether he was agreeable to omitting 'in 1844' from the title.
— 540 672 Engels may have meant the following works by Henry George: Our Land and Land Policy (1871), Progress and Poverty (1880), The Irish Land Question (1881), Social Problems (1883), Protection or Free Trade (1886).
—540 673 Engels is referring to the following passage from the Manifesto of the Communist Party: 'The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the en­ forcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future ofthat movement' (see present edition, Vol.
6, p.
518).
— 541 674 This is Engels' reply to the invitation to join Karl Pearson's Club (see Note 678) which Dr Horatio Bryan Donkin passed on to him via Eleanor Marx-Aveling (see Eleanor Marx-Aveling's letter to Horatio Bryan Donkin of 8 February 1886, this volume, pp.
547-48).
The original is kept in the library at University College, London (Pearson Pa­ pers, 10/36).
It was found by the German scholar Erhard Kiehnbaum and published in German translation in Die Wahrheit, 1/2 October 1988.
We were kindly present­ ed with a x-copy of the original for publication in Marx's and Engels' Collected Works.
— 543 675 The reference is to Engels' editing of the English translation of Volume I of Marx's Capital (see this volume, Note 56).
— 543 676 Engels is probably referring to the discussions at Pearson's Club of issues relating to the family and the social emancipation of women (see Note 678).
He dealt with these questions in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the Stale (see notes 174, 264 and 555).
—543 677 The original of this letter is kept in the library at University College, London (Pearson Papers, 10/37).
It was published in German translation by the German scholar Erhard Kiehnbaum in Die Wahrheit, 1/2 October 1988.
We were kindly presented with a x-copy of the original for publication in Marx's and Engels' Collected Works.
— 547 678 The reference is to the Club established by Karl Pearson, an English biologist and philosopher, to encourage free and unbridled discussions on questions connected in some way or another with relations between men and women.
Its members were 15-20 intellectuals, among them Horatio Bryan Donkin, a doctor who had treated Marx, and Olive Schreiner, a friend of Eleanor who had written a book entitled Woman and Labour.
The discussions centred on Pearson's books The Woman Question and Socialism and Sex.
Pearson, who sympathised with the workers' and socialist movement, wished to recruit Engels and Eleanor Marx-Aveling as members of the Club; in the summer of 1885 the latter had published a review of Bebel's book Die Frau und der Sozialismus (see Note 145).
— 547 679 It is clear from the correspondence between Donkin and Pearson that Eleanor Marx-Aveling intended to visit the Club in April 1886 but never carried out this plan.
The Club's minutes contain no record of any contributions made by Engels or Eleanor.
