The work s in this volume reflect Engels' wide rang e of activitie s in the final years of his life.
These include editing the manuscript s of Volum e Three of Capital fo r publication , helpin g socialis t parties i n workin g out theses and tactics , day-to-da y contact s with representatives o f variou s nationa l working-clas s movement s and attempting t o consolidat e the revolutionar y forces of the interna -tional proletariat .
Engels als o paid particula r attentio n to foreig n policy question s against the backgroun d of a growing threat of war in Europe .
In this volum e the reader will find a number of items which, although brief, are of major theoretica l importance .
They vary greatly i n form, includin g article s for journal s and newspapers , prefaces an d introduction s to new edition s of works by Marx and by Engels himself, message s of greeting s to socialis t parties and workers' organisations , various notes, and so on.
The content s of this volum e are closely connecte d with the volumes containin g Engels' correspondence fo r 1890-189 5 (vols 48, 49 and 50).
Many of the problem s merely mentione d in passing her e are examine d in greate r detail in his letters.
In his writings an d correspondenc e of this period Engels sums up , as it were, hi s reflection s on the historica l experienc e of the struggl e for emancipatio n of the proletaria t over the precedin g decades , and at the same time consider s new trend s in economic s and politics, tryin g to assess the effect of these change s on the prospec t of the internationa l revolutionar y process .
Throughout th e whole volum e runs the idea that the capitalis t mode of productio n has proved to be stabler than it appeare d before, an d capabl e of developin g furthe r and of extendin g its spheres o f influence .
In this connectio n Engels emphasises th e need fo r socialis t parties to make use of bourgeois-democrati c institutions t o win over the mass of the workin g class and other strata of the workin g people whilst at the same time continuin g to struggle fo r the ultimat e goal, the establishmen t of a new social order.
Engels examines al l the major problem s characteristi c of this historical perio d both from the viewpoin t of the most pressin g tasks an d of the more remot e prospect s of the working-clas s struggle.
H e devote s his attentio n to change s in the politica l life of many Europea n states , the impressiv e achievement s of the working-class movemen t (the formatio n and consolidatio n of the socialist partie s and the creatio n of a new internationa l proletaria n alliance, th e Secon d International) , and the growt h of this movement int o a significan t politica l force.
Alongsid e the recogni -tion of Marxis m as the theoretica l basis for socialis t parties, he also perceives a certain reviva l of opportunis m and anarchism , and a tendency t o vulgaris e and distort Marx's teaching .
Engels notes the increasingly uneve n developmen t of capitalis m and the aggrava -tion of contradiction s betwee n the leadin g capitalis t countries , fraught wit h the dange r of war in Europe .
Engels' research wor k was always concrete .
His theoretica l writings wer e inseparabl e from his practica l participatio n in the working-class struggle .
This is equally true of the final period of his life.
Almost all the works publishe d in this volume were written either in respons e to specifi c events in the working-clas s and socialist movemen t or in connectio n with the need to develo p and explain highl y importan t question s of Marxis t theory .
A majo r place in this activit y was occupie d by question s concerning Marx' s economi c teaching .
Engels considered i t his prime dut y to complet e the work on and disseminat e Marx' s Capital Th e end of 1894 saw the publicatio n of Volum e Three .
Engels had worke d on the manuscript s for about ten years.
He gave a brief outlin e of the content s and a descriptio n of its connection wit h the earlier volume s in "The Third Volum e of Karl Marx' s Capital" an d "On the Content s of the Third Volum e of Capital", publishe d here.
In the Preface to Volum e Three (see present edition , Vol.
37) Engels described th e difficultie s he had encountered i n his work, noting that the delay in publicatio n was due to pressin g obligation s to the internationa l workers ' move-ment.
Th e fourth Germa n edition of Volum e One of Capital cam e out in 1890 and the second edition of Volum e Two in 1893, both under hi s editorship .
In the preface to the fourth Germa n edition of Volum e One (see presen t edition , Vol.
35) Engels showed ye t again th e invalidit y of attempt s by certain bourgeoi s economist s to accuse Mar x of misquotin g and thereb y discredi t him as a scholar.
(See also In the Case of Brentano Versus Marx whic h is also devote d to this question.
) The new edition , prepare d by Engels, of Marx' s popula r work Wage Labour and Capital (1891 ) also served to propagat e Marx's economic teaching .
Engels made som e alteration s and addition s to the text of this work (writte n in 1849) in keepin g with Marx' s subsequent developmen t of his economi c teaching .
The Introduc -tion to this edition contain s a popular expositio n of the principle s of Marxis t politica l economy , above all, of the mechanis m of capitalist exploitation .
Up to his very last days Engels sought t o keep abreas t of the processes takin g place in capitalis t economy .
He concentrate d on the change s in the forms of organisatio n of capitalis t productio n which ha d been detecte d in embry o by Marx and himsel f back in the 1870s , and which acquire d a more distinc t characte r in the last decade o f the 19th century .
In his work "A Critiqu e of the Draft Social-Democratic Programm e of 1891" and in severa l other articles h e noted the rapidly growin g significanc e of such forms of production an d capita l concentratio n as joint-stoc k companies , cartels an d trusts , "whic h dominat e and monopolis e whole branches o f industry " (p.
224) and are an "organise d monopoly " (p.
330).
Engels saw this phenomenon , and also the increasin g role played b y stock-exchang e operation s and the export of capital , as well as the growin g unevennes s in the developmen t of differen t countries, a s the main tendencie s determinin g the future develop -ment of the capitalis t mode of production , which later, at the turn of the century , led to the entry of capitalis m into a qualitativel y new stage , imperialism .
These ideas were worke d out in greate r detail by Engels i n his Supplementar y Notes to Volum e Three of Capital, "Th e Stock Exchange " (presen t edition , Vol.
37), in some footnotes t o the text of that volume and addition s to the fourth German editio n of Socialism: Utopian and Scientific publishe d in 1891 (presen t edition , Vol.
24, pp.
318 and 323), and also in the additions t o the text of Anti-Dühring made in Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (presen t edition , Vol.
25, pp.
639-40 and 642).
The tendenc y for free competitiv e capitalis m to grow into monopoly capitalis m and the increasin g role of the bourgeoi s state in the managemen t of the econom y were regarde d by Engels, on the one hand, as evidenc e of the relative stability of capitalism—it s ability to create new forms of the organisatio n of productio n more in keepin g with the growin g productiv e forces and—o n the other, as a factor contributin g to the aggravatio n of contradiction s between th e major capitalis t states.
An importan t part of Engels' theoretical wor k was the formula -tion of tactics for socialis t parties with due regard for change s that had occurre d in the previou s twenty years in the economi c and political lif e of Europea n states, particularl y in the working-clas s movement itself.
A considerabl e portion of this volume is taken up by work s which analys e the situatio n and prospect s of the working-class struggl e and determin e the ways and means of attaining immediat e and ultimat e aims in the contex t of the specific nationa l characteristic s of each country .
Engels wrote many of them in the form of preface s and introduction s to new editions o f Marx's and his own works.
For these new edition s he chose suc h works as elucidate d key problem s of the struggl e of the previous fe w decade s and were therefor e particularl y relevan t to socialist partie s formed during the precedin g ten to fifteen years; these work s were to help them maste r the Marxis t metho d of analysing curren t events and find the most effectiv e means for practical struggle .
The new publication s of such works as The Civil War in France an d The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 b y Marx, thei r joint work Manifesto of the Communist Party, Engels' The Condition of the Working-Class in England an d others enable d him in the introduction s and preface s not only to expres s his own ideas on the forms and prospect s of the struggl e for emancipation , but also to introduc e reader s to the Marxis t metho d of studyin g contemporary politica l and tactica l problems .
Another grou p of works consists of articles written in connectio n with specifi c events in the working-clas s movemen t or in the political lif e of individua l countries .
These writing s proved to be of great interes t for the internationa l socialis t movemen t as a whole.
Changes i n the politica l climat e were felt most of all in Germany.
Thi s was directl y linked with the successe s of the German Socia l Democrats , the stronges t contingen t of the international socialis t working-clas s movemen t at that time.
The present volum e opens with two article s dealin g with the major victory o f the Germa n socialist s in the election s to the Reichsta g on February 20 , 1890 — "The Election s of 1890 in Germany " and "What Now?"—i n which Engels highly assesse s this event which meant th e failure of attempt s by the reactionar y bourgeois-Junke r governmental blo c to put down the revolutionar y vanguar d of the German workin g class.
The fate of the Anti-Socialis t Law was thus predetermined.
I n the autum n of the same year it was repealed .
Its initiato r and the main organise r of the persecutio n of the socialists, Bismarck , had retired even before that, shortly after the elections.
Th e collaps e of the Bismarc k regime was importan t not only for the Germa n workin g class.
It showed that the policy of outright suppressio n of the socialis t working-clas s movemen t had outlived itself.
It becam e clear that the bourgeoisi e would now increasingly determin e its policy with a view to combinin g its political hegemon y with the legalisatio n of the working-clas s movement.
Thi s tendenc y manifeste d itself in other West Euro-pean countrie s as well.
Socialis t parties were faced with the need to interpret th e qualitativ e change s in politica l life and work out tactics suite d to the new situation .
Engels called on them to do this, stressin g that in the presen t circumstance s legal means of struggle coul d be far more effectiv e than attempt s to force events without an y chanc e of success .
"The attemp t must be made, " wrote Engels in his "Farewel l Letter to the Reader s of the Sozialdemokrat", "to get along with legal method s of struggl e for the time being.
Not only we are doing this, it is being done by all workers' partie s in all countrie s where the worker s have a certain measure o f legal freedom of action, and this for the simple reason that it is the most productiv e metho d for them" (this volume , p.
78).
In the article "Socialis m in Germany" , which analyse s the results of the parliamentar y election s in that country over the precedin g twenty years , he again stresse s that legality "is workin g so well for us that we would be mad to spurn it as long as the situatio n lasts" (p.
241).
Engels sets out these conclusion s in most detail in his final wor k "Introductio n to Karl Marx's The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 (1895)" .
He again remind s reader s that the socialists no w have to wage their struggl e in a totally new situation , a time of relativel y peacefu l development , when they can 2-1550 successfully mak e use of legal means of workin g in the masses and in the interest s of the masse s in most capitalis t states.
Engels regarded it as the most importan t internationa l achievemen t of the German Socia l Democrat s that they had managed , even under the Anti-Socialist Law , to becom e a truly mass party and thus to prove the correctnes s of their chosen tactics by combinin g legal and illegal mean s withou t resortin g to violence .
"Everywher e the German exampl e of utilisin g the suffrage , of winnin g all posts accessible t o us, has been imitated " (p.
520).
Historical experience , particularl y that of the Paris Commune , has show n that the victory of the socialis t revolution , in whateve r form, is impossibl e withou t the consciou s participatio n of the broad masses .
Consequentl y Engels insisted o n the need to use all possible mean s to win over the masses : "Where it is a question of a complete transformatio n of the social organisation , the masse s themselves mus t also be in on it, must themselve s already have grasped wha t is at stake, what they are fightin g for,bod y and soul" (ibid.
).
Here Engels wa s referring no t only to the workers , but to other strat a of workin g people , above all, the peasantry .
".
.
.
Eve n in France, " he wrote further on, "the Socialist s are realisin g more and mor e that no lasting victory is possibl e for them unless they first win over the great mass of the people , i.
e.
the peasant s in this instance" (pp .
520-21) .
However, i n this work and others publishe d in this volume , Engels at the same time warns against relying exclusivel y on legal means o f struggl e and stresse s constantl y that socialis t parties should b e ready to use other tactics, includin g violent ones, if the ruling classe s again resort to aggressiv e method s of suppressin g the workers ' movemen t and if the course of historica l developmen t leads to a revolutionar y crisis.
At the same time Engels saw the complexitie s and dif-ficulties facin g socialis t parties in the new historica l conditions .
This applie d to the Germa n Social Democrat s in particular .
The transition t o new forms of struggl e had produce d phenomen a in their rank s which arouse d Engels' misgivings.
I n the article s "Reply t o the Editor s of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung" and "Reply t o Mr.
Paul Ernst" , both publishe d in this volume , and others, Engels condemned action s by the oppositiona l group of the "Young" a t the beginnin g of the 1890s, which made demagogi c use of the opportunis t mistake s of individua l party leader s and accused al l its leadershi p of renouncin g revolutionar y aims.
The oppositional grou p also sough t to force upon the party "tactic s that are utterly insane " (p.
85) and adventuristi c and make it reduce parliamentar y activity , etc.
, to a minimum .
Such tactics , Engels shows, woul d inevitabl y lead to a break with the masses and might provok e the authoritie s to renew persecutions ; in short, they "would b e sufficien t to bury the stronges t party of millions " (p.
70).
Engels' speeches an d also his numerou s letters to comrades-in-arms (se e presen t edition , Vol.
48) rendere d impor -tant assistanc e to the party leader s in their struggl e agains t the group of the "Young" , which ceased to exist shortly afterwards .
Engels saw another , even greater , dange r in the opportunis t moods o f a numbe r of active party members , which were increasingly reflectin g reformis t trends .
His exposur e of such views wa s of special importanc e in connectio n with the draftin g in 1891 of a new programm e for the Social-Democrati c Party of Germany.
Precisel y becaus e of this Engels considered i t expedien t to publis h Marx' s manuscrip t Critique of the Gotha Programme (present edition , Vol.
24) hithert o known only to a few party leaders.
I n his Preface to the publicatio n Engels wrote: " I think I would b e guilty of suppressio n if I any longer withhel d from publicity thi s important—perhap s the most important—documen t relevant t o this discussion " (this volume , p.
92).
It focusse d the attention o f the Germa n Social Democrat s on the importanc e of revolutionary theor y for the day-to-da y practic e of the working -class movemen t to counterbalanc e the pragmatis m characteristi c of the opportunists , in particular , the follower s of Lassalle.
It dealt a heavy blo w to the cult of Ferdinan d Lassalle, still widesprea d at that tim e amon g Germa n Social Democrats .
This publicatio n displeased som e party leader s at first, but it was widely ap-preciated i n party circles .
The appearanc e of this work by Marx largely mad e it possible to overcom e Lassallea n influenc e in the new party programme .
"A Critiqu e of the Draft Social-Democrati c Programm e of 1891", written in the form of comment s on the draft and not then intended fo r publicatio n is a most importan t documen t reflectin g Engels' role in the victory of Marxis t programmati c and tactica l principles i n Germa n Social Democracy .
Stressin g that the draft "differs ver y favourabl y from the former programme " and "is, on the whole , based on present-da y science " (p.
219), Engels made a number o f comment s whose theoretica l significanc e goes far beyond concret e criticis m of the draft's individua l theses .
He noted, i n particular , the erroneou s nature of the categorica l assertion tha t the povert y of the worker s was growing : "This is 2* incorrect whe n put in such a categorica l way.
The organisatio n of the worker s and their constantl y growin g resistanc e will possibl y check th e increase of misery t o a certain extent .
However , what certainly doe s increas e is the insecurity of existence" (p .
223).
In this work Engels gave a precise and apt definitio n of the nature o f opportunism , directe d straigh t at the representative s of the right wing of the Germa n Social Democrats : "This forgettin g of the great, the principa l consideration s for the momentar y interests o f the day, this strugglin g and strivin g for the success of the momen t regardles s of later consequences , this sacrific e of the future o f the movemen t for its presen t .
.
.
is and remain s opportunism" (p .
227).
Most of Engels' criticisms o f the draft programm e referre d to the sectio n on politica l demands .
He stresse d the profoun d inner connection o f the struggl e for the socialis t transformatio n of society wit h the struggl e for democrati c rights .
In the specifi c conditions o f Germany , he noted, the prime task of the proletaria t was to do away with the "semi-absolutist , and moreove r indescriba -bly confuse d politica l order" (p.
226) and to set up a democratic -republic, tha t vital prerequisit e for the proletaria t to gain politica l power.
Engels did not exclud e the possibilit y that, in countrie s with establishe d democrati c tradition s where "the representative s of the people concentrat e all power in their hands" (ibid.
), this process migh t take place peacefully .
Although no t all Engels' suggestions wer e fully accepted , he was satisfied wit h the text of the programm e adopte d at the Erfurt Congress o f the party in Octobe r 1891.
On the whole this programme wa s of a Marxist nature and served for many years as a model for the socialist s of other countries .
Engels examined th e problem s of the state and also speculate d about th e society of the future in his "Introductio n to Karl Marx's The Civil War in France".
Bearin g in mind the experienc e of the two decade s followin g the Paris Commune , he gave a profoun d analysis o f the Commune' s historica l significanc e and lessons .
He noted in particula r its efforts to "safeguar d itself against its own deputies an d officials " and to create guarantee s agains t the "transformation o f the state and the organs of the state from servants o f society into master s of society " (pp.
189, 190) by ensuring tha t all official s were elected and could be dismisse d at any time on a decision of the voters and that all materia l privilege s for them were abolished .
"In this way," he believed , "an effectiv e barrier t o place-huntin g and careerism " would be set up (p.
190).
Concerning th e long-ter m prospect s for the state after the establishment o f socialis t social relations , Engels expressed th e conviction tha t it would continu e to exist "until such time as a generation reare d in new, free social condition s is able to throw the entir e lumbe r of the state on the scrap heap" (ibid.
).
He repeated thi s idea in the "Prefac e to the Pamphle t Internationales aus dem 'VolksstaaV (1871-75)", addin g that the party's ultimat e aim was "to surpas s the entire State, and thus democrac y too" (p.
417).
Engels' description o f the class essenc e of the state was aimed directly a t Social-Democrati c philistine s who feel "a superstitiou s reverence fo r the state" (p.
190).
One of Engels' las t works, "Th e Peasant Questio n in Franc e and Germany" , was also directe d against opportunis t element s in internationa l Social Democracy .
In this work Engels developed furthe r the principle s of the proletarian party' s agraria n programm e and its tactics in relatio n to the peasantry .
The work was prompte d by two events .
First, by the adoption , by the congres s of the French Workers ' Party in September 1894 , of an agraria n programm e in which one of the party's task s was to retain small peasan t holding s under capitalis m and defen d the interest s of all peasants , includin g those who exploited hire d labour , which was in direct contradictio n to the ultimate aim s of the socialists .
Second , by an addres s at the congress o f the Germa n Social Democrat s by the leader of their Bavarian organisatio n Georg Vollmar , who set forth simila r aims and denie d the need for a differentiate d approac h to the variou s categories o f peasants .
These facts testifie d to a lack of clarity on this questio n among socialists , which is what led Engels to write this article .
It is Engels who explaine d that under capitalis m the peasantr y should no t be regarde d as a single whole, becaus e it is in the process o f differentiatio n and the interest s of its differen t categories ar e not the same.
Therefor e the tactics of socialis t parties i n respec t of the big, middle and small peasantr y should be different.
Engels explained th e importanc e of an allianc e of the proletariat wit h the small peasantr y both for the historica l fate of the peasant s themselve s and for the succes s of the socialis t transformation o f society .
Socialis t parties , he wrote , should explain t o the small peasantr y the danger s which the developmen t of capitalis m posed for them, the coincidenc e of their vital interests wit h the interest s of the workin g class, and what they stood to gain from the abolitio n of capitalism .
Engels believed tha t after th e victory of the socialis t revolutio n the main path of agricultural developmen t would lie in the cooperatio n of peasan t farms, in turnin g small-scal e propert y "into co-operativ e propert y operated co-operatively " (p.
497).
He particularl y emphasise d that the cooperativ e organisatio n of peasan t farms should procee d on a strictly voluntar y basis and warne d agains t being over-hast y here.
Concerning futur e society , Engels frequently stresse d that one coul d speak only about certain main features , basic laws, which coul d be determine d proceedin g from know n facts and trends o f development , but not about details, for the discussio n of which lif e had not yet provide d material .
"We are evolutionaries, we have no intentio n of dictatin g definitiv e laws to mankind .
Prejudices instea d of detaile d organisatio n of the society of the future?" Engels asked th e corresponden t of the French newspape r Le Figaro, wh o interviewe d him in May 1893.
"You will find no trace of that amongs t us.
We shall be satisfie d when we have placed th e means of productio n in the hands of the community " (p.
547).
The entir e content s of this volume bear eloquen t testimon y to the outstandin g role which Engels continued t o play even in the fi-nal year s of his life in the internationa l working-clas s socialis t movement.
A s Engels himself wrot e in his Prefac e to Volum e Three o f Capital "th e work as go-between s for the nationa l movements o f Socialist s and worker s in the variou s countries " (present edition , Vol.
37) shifted entirel y to his shoulder s after the death of Marx.
Engel s invariably combine d this activity with his theoretical studies , even if this affecte d their progress .
"But if a man has been active in the movemen t for more than fifty years, as I have been," he continued , "he regard s the work connecte d with it as a bounde n duty that brooks no delay" (ibid.
).
The mor e the movement itsel f grew, socialis t parties were formed , and new socialist newspaper s and journal s appeared , the wider and stronger Engels' international contact s became and the greater was his authorit y as a teacher and advise r of socialist s the world over.
He contribute d directl y to the socialis t press of Germany , France , Italy, Austria , Britain and other countries , and to the Russia n émigré press.
Th e numerou s document s publishe d in this volume , such as greeting s to variou s nationa l contingent s of the working -class movement , letters to the press, speeches , etc.
, show the extent of his influenc e in the internationa l working-clas s movement , his tireles s struggl e to consolidat e Marxis m as the ideologica l basis of the proletariat' s struggle .
To the very end of his days Engels maintained regula r contac t with the socialist s of almost all the Europea n countrie s and the United States , giving them valuabl e assistanc e in solving theoretica l and tactica l problems .
The role he played in the internationa l socialist movemen t may furthe r be seen from the fact that correspondents o f the bourgeoi s press frequentl y turned to him, as can be seen from his interview s in the Appendice s to this volume.
Some o f the works in the volum e reflec t Engels' actual participation i n the British working-clas s movemen t of the time, and the assistanc e he gave to those who were trying to set up a mass proletaria n party in Britain .
Engels hoped tha t such a party would "pu t an early end to the seesaw game of the two old parties which hav e been succeedin g each other in power and thereb y perpetuating bourgeoi s rule" (this volume , p.
323).
His hopes that the Independen t Labou r Party set up in 1893 would play such a role did not materialise .
Engels continued t o rende r the utmos t assistanc e to his followers i n the Frenc h socialis t movement .
He welcome d the successes o f the socialis t movemen t in Austria-Hungar y and noted with satisfactio n the first perceptibl e advance s of the socialis t cause in the Slav countrie s ("To the Editoria l Board of the Bulgaria n Magazine Sotsial-Demokrat", "Fo r the Czech Comrade s on Their May Day Celebration " and others) .
In his "Prefac e to the Polish Edition (1892 ) of the Manifesto of the Communist Party" Engels noted th e growin g role of the young Polish proletaria t in the struggle fo r the independenc e and nationa l revival of Poland .
In the first half of the 1890s Engels devoted considerabl e attention t o the Second Internationa l formed in 1889.
He helped with the preparator y work for its initial congresses , striving to ensure tha t the influenc e of Marx's adherent s predominate d and struggling t o preserv e the unity of the internationa l working-clas s movement an d bring the mass workers ' organisations , particularl y the Britis h trade unions , into this new internationa l alliance (see, for example , pp.
74-75).
"We must permit discussio n in order not to become a sect," Engels wrote, "bu t the commo n standpoin t must be retained " (p.
405).
Addressin g the Internationa l Socialis t Workers' Congres s in Zurich in 1893, Engels noted wit h satisfac -tion that the new International , created on the basis of uniting the independent socialis t parties , was much stronge r than the forme r (pp.
404-05) .
Engels attached grea t importanc e to the May Day celebrations , first held in 1890 followin g a decision of the Paris Congres s of the Second Internationa l under the slogan of the struggl e for an eight-hour workin g day.
He called this event "the first internation -al action o f the militan t workin g class" (p.
61).
Engels himself took par t in May Day meeting s in Londo n and sent May Day greetings t o the worker s of various countries .
He sought to turn this celebratio n into a traditiona l display of the solidarit y of the international proletariat , regardin g it as an importan t means of the internationa l educatio n of the workin g masses and of winnin g them ove r to socialism .
Unity amon g the revolutionar y forces of internationa l socialis m was of great importanc e in promotin g the vital interest s of the working class , and also in fightin g militaris m and the threat of war in Europe .
Several works in the volume , such as The Foreign Policy of Russian Tsardom, "Socialis m in Germany " and Can Europe Disarm?, dea l with problem s of internationa l relations , providin g an analysi s of the causes behind the aggravatio n of contradiction s between th e leading capitalis t countrie s and setting out the tasks of socialists i n the struggl e agains t the threat of war.
Referring t o the military-politica l blocs which were formed at that time , the Triple Allianc e of Germany , Austria-Hungar y and Italy, on the one hand, and the Franco-Russia n Alliance , which was finall y set up at the beginnin g of the 1890s, on the other, Engels wrote: "Bot h camps are preparin g for a decisive battle, for a war, such as the world has not yet seen, in which 10 to 15 millio n armed combatant s will stand face to face" (p.
46).
He attached specia l importanc e to the role played by the ruling circles of the Russia n Empir e and to its diplomati c activities , and believe d that tsaris t autocracy , notwithstandin g considerabl e change s in the international alignmen t of forces beginnin g from the 1870s , remained th e main bulwar k of Europea n reaction .
The questio n of the ways and future destin y of the revolutio -nary movemen t in Russia was, thus, closely connecte d with the future o f the internationa l working-clas s movement .
With his article The Foreign Policy of Russian Tsardom, writte n speciall y for the first Russia n Marxis t journa l Sotsial-demokrat publishe d in Geneva, Engels wanted t o attract the attentio n of Russian socialist s and the socialis t parties of other countrie s to the internationa l significance o f the imminen t popula r revolutio n in Russia .
Engels closely followe d the socio-economi c developmen t of Russia an d the mountin g signs of the imminen t revolutionar y crisis ther e on accoun t of the role tsarist Russia played in world politics a s the "last stronghold " of Europea n reaction .
He finally concluded tha t "the transformatio n of the countr y into a capitalis t industrial nation , the proletarianisatio n of a large proportio n of the peasantr y and the decay of the old communisti c commune " was proceedin g swiftly (p.
433).
The collaps e of tsarist autocracy , Engels argued, woul d have a decisive impac t on the politica l climate i n Europe , undermin e the position s of reactionar y regime s and, perhaps , also lead to their downfall .
"It [a Russia n revolution]," wrote Engels in his "Afterwor d (1894) to 'On Social Relations i n Russia'" , "will also give the labour movemen t of the West fres h impetu s and create new, better condition s in which to carry on the struggle , thus hastenin g the victory of the moder n industrial proletariat " (ibid).
In the face of the growin g threat of a war of unprecedente d proportions, whic h would inflict great losses primaril y on the working masse s of the belligeren t countries , Engels invariably stressed tha t the internationa l workin g class had a vital interest in preserving peace .
He did his utmost to suppor t all the actions of socialists aime d agains t militaris m and the threat of war.
In connection wit h the forthcomin g discussio n in the Germa n Reichstag o f a new draft militar y law Engels published a series of articles entitle d Can Europe Disarm?, whic h were intende d to assist the action s of Social-Democrati c deputie s on this question .
Engels put forwar d a well-argue d programm e for the gradua l reductio n of arms and the turnin g of standin g armies "into a militia based on the universa l arming of the people " (p.
371).
While Engels was under n o illusion s as to the plan being accepte d by the Europea n powers, h e believe d that his proposal s would provid e Social Democrats wit h a new weapo n for exposin g the anti-popula r militaristic polic y of the ruling circles and serve to extend their influence.
A numbe r of theoretica l works in this volum e develo p the materialist interpretatio n of history and its applicatio n to concret e historical research .
In the Introductio n to the Englis h editio n (1892) o f his work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, a n introductio n of theoretica l importanc e in its own right, Engels used the term "historical materialism " for the first time and gave a concise, apt description o f this vital part of Marxism .
He define d it as a view "of the course of history which seeks the ultimat e cause and the great movin g powe r of all importan t histori c events in the economic developmen t of society , in the change s in the modes of production an d exchange , in the consequen t divisio n of society into distinc t classes , and in the struggle s of these classes agains t one another " (p.
289).
Demonstratin g the invalidit y of attempt s by agnostics t o prove that the world is unknowable , Engels develops and substantiates , the thesis that human practic e is the criterio n of truth.
Th e Introductio n contain s a vivid accoun t of the main stages in the ideologica l and politica l struggl e of the bourgeoisi e against feudalis m and shows that, with the developmen t of the working-class movement , the bourgeoisi e rejecte d free-thinkin g and turne d again to religion , seeing it as a means of struggl e against th e revolutionar y workers ' movement .
The article s "On the History of Early Christianity " and "To the Early Histor y of the Family " are example s of the applicatio n of the materialis t interpretatio n of history to concret e historica l issues.
Engels revised thi s edition in the light of the latest scientifi c data.
Engels' reply to Paul Ernst, one of the leaders of the oppositio n group o f the "Young " in Germa n Social Democracy , attacks the vulgarisation o f historica l materialism .
Engels comes ou t firmly against th e oversimplified , schemati c use of Marx's teachin g to explain historica l phenomena .
".
.
.
The materialis t method, " he wrote, "turn s into its opposit e if, in an historica l study, it is used not as a guide but rather as a ready-mad e pattern in accordanc e with whic h one tailors the historica l facts" (p.
81).
This letter is one of the first in a series written in the first half of the 1890s and known a s the "Letter s on Historica l Materialism" .
They elaborat e on the numerou s question s relatin g to the materialis t interpreta -tion of history .
Engels explains tha t the view of the econom y as the only active factor in the historica l proces s is nothin g but a primitive interpretatio n of historica l materialism .

FREDERICK ENGEL S WORKS February 1890-Apri l 1895 [THE ELECTION S OF 1890 IN GERMANY] 1 That the Social-Democrati c party of German y was sure to obtain a startlin g succes s at the genera l electio n of 1890 could not be doubted b y any one who had followe d the politica l developmen t of that countr y for the last decade .
In 1878 the Germa n Socialist s were place d under rigorou s coercio n laws, 2 in virtue of which all their newspaper s had been suppressed , their meeting s stoppe d or dissolved, thei r organisatio n annihilated , their every attemp t to re-form i t punishe d as a "secret society" , sentence s summin g up to more tha n a thousan d years' imprisonmen t having thus been pronounced agains t member s of the party.
Nevertheless , they succeeded i n smugglin g into the country , and regularl y distribut -ing every week some 10,000 copies of their organ printe d abroad , the Sozialdemokrat, and thousand s upon thousand s of pamphlets ; they succeede d in penetratin g into the Germa n Parliamen t (nine members) 3 and into innumerabl e town councils , amongs t others that of Berlin.
The growin g strengt h of the party was evident even to its most embittere d enemies .
Yet such a success as they have scored on the 20th Februar y must surpris e even the most sanguin e among themselves .
Twenty -one seats conquered : that is to say, in twenty electora l districts they proved stronge r than all other parties put together .
Fifty-eigh t second ballots , that is to say, in 58 district s they are either the strongest, o r the stronges t but one, of all parties which have put forward candidates , and the fresh electio n will finally decid e between th e two candidate s who had the greates t number , while neither ha d the absolut e majorit y of votes.
As to the total numbe r of Socialis t votes given, we can only make an approximat e estimate.
I n 1871 they summe d up not more than 102,000 ; in 1877, 493,000 ; in 1884, 550,000 ; in 1887, 763,000 ; in 1890, they cannot b e less than 1,250,000 , and may be considerabl y more.
The strength o f the party has increase d in three years by at least 60-70 pe r cent.
In 1887 there were but three parties with more than a million voters, th e Nationa l Liberals , 1,678,000 ; the Centre or Catholi c party, 1,516,000 ; and the Conservatives , 1,147,000.
4 This time the Centre wil l hold its own, the Conservative s have lost a good deal, and the Nationa l Liberal s have lost enormously .
Thus the Socialist s will still be outnumbere d by the Centre , but they will either fully come up to, or outnumber , the Nationa l Liberal s as well as the Conservatives.
This electio n establishe s a complet e revolutio n in the state of parties i n Germany .
It will indeed inaugurat e a new epoch in the history o f that country .
It marks the beginnin g of the end of the Bismarck period .
The situation , at the presen t moment , is as follows.
With his rescript s on labour legislatio n and internationa l labour conferences, youn g Willia m broke loose from his mento r Bis-marck.
5 The latter though t it pruden t to give his young maste r plenty o f rope, and to wait quietly until William II, had got himself int o a mess with his hobby of playing the workin g man's friend: the n would be the time for Bismarc k to step in as the deus ex machina* This tim e Bismarc k did not care much how the elections went ; an unmanageabl e Reichstag , to be dissolve d as soon as the young Empero r had found out his mistake , would be rather an advantag e to Bismarck , and considerabl e Socialis t success might help to prepar e a good cry to go to the countr y with when the time for dissolutio n arrived .
And the wily Chancellor , this time, has indee d got a Reichsta g that nobody will be able to manage .
William II , will very soon find out the impossibility , for a man in his position , and with the presen t state of mind of both the landed aristocracy an d the middle class, of carryin g out even a shadow of the object s allude d to in his rescripts , while the election s have already convince d him that the workin g class of German y will take anything h e may offer them as an instalment , but will not give up one jot of their principle s and demands , nor relax in their opposition agains t a Governmen t which cannot live but by gaggin g the workin g majorit y of the people .

5 Thus, before long there will be a conflict betwee n Empero r and Parliament; th e Socialist s will be accused , by all rival parties, with being th e cause of it all; the new electio n cry will be there, ready made; an d then Bismarck , having given the necessar y lesson to his lord and master , will step in and dissolve .
But then he will find that things have changed .
The Socialis t workmen wil l be stronge r and more determine d than ever.
The aristocracy Bismarc k never could rely on; they always considere d him as a traitor to true Conservatism , and will be ready to throw him overboar d as soon as the Empero r choose s to drop him.
The middle clas s were his mainstay , but they have lost confidenc e in him.
Th e little family quarre l betwee n Bismarc k and the Empero r has com e to be publicl y known .
It has proved that Bismarc k is no longer all-powerful , and that the Empero r is not proof agains t dangerous crotchets .
In which of the two, then, is the Germa n middle clas s Philistin e to trust? The wise man is becomin g powerless, an d the powerfu l man proves to be unwise .
In fact, the confidence i n the stabilit y of the order of things establishe d in 1871, a confidenc e which, as regards the Germa n middle class, was unshakeable whil e old William reigned , Bismarc k governed , and Moltke wa s at the head of the army—tha t confidenc e is gone, and gone for ever.
The growin g load of taxation , the high price of living cause d by ridiculou s import duties on everything , food as well as manufacture d goods , the unbearabl e burde n of militar y service, th e constan t and ever-renewe d fear of war, and that a war of Europea n dimensions , when 4-5 million s of German s would have to take up arms—al l this has done its work in alienatin g from th e Governmen t the peasant , the small tradesman , the workman, i n fact the whole nation , with the exceptio n of the few who profi t by the State-create d monopolies .
All this would be borne, a s inevitable , so long as old William , Moltke , and Bismarc k formed a ruling triumvirat e which seeme d invincible .
But now old William i s dead, Moltke is pensione d off, and Bismarc k has to face a young Empero r whom he himsel f filled with an unbounde d vanity, wh o is consequentl y considerin g himself a second Frederic k the Great , and is, after all, but a conceite d coxcomb , eager to shake of f the yoke of his Chancellor , and, withal, a playthin g in the hand s of court intriguers .
With such a state of things , the immense pressur e upon the people no longer is patientl y borne ; the old faith in the stabilit y of things is gone; resistance , which formerly appeare d hopeless , now become s a necessity ; and thus, unmanageable a s this Reichsta g seems, maybe it will be far less so than the next.
3-1550 Thus Bismarc k very likely is miscalculatin g his game.
If he dissolve, eve n the spectre rouge, the anti-Socialis t cry, may fail him.
But then he has one undoubte d quality : reckles s energy .
If it suits him, he may provok e riots and try what effect a little "bleeding " may have .
But then he ought not to forget that at least one-hal f of the Germa n Socialist s have passed throug h the army.
There they have learne d the disciplin e which has enable d them so far to withstand al l provocatio n to riot.
But there they have also learnt something more .

81, April 6, 1890 WHAT NOW? 6 February 20 , 1890 is the beginnin g of the end of the Bismarc k era.
Th e allianc e betwee n Junker s and money-bag s for the exploitation o f the mass of the Germa n people—fo r the Cartel 7 was this and nothin g else—i s bearing its fruit.
The tax on spirits, the suga r premium , the corn and meat duties, which conjure d millions fro m the people' s pocket s into the pocket s of the Junkers ; the industria l protectiv e tariffs , introduce d just at the momen t when Germa n industry , by its own efforts and in free trade, had won for itself a positio n in the world market , introduce d specifically an d exclusivel y so that the manufacture r could sell at home at monopol y prices , and abroa d at giveawa y prices ; the whole syste m of indirec t taxation , which oppresse s the poore r masses o f the peopl e and scarcel y touche s the rich; the tax burden, growin g to the intolerable , to cover the cost of endlessl y growing armaments ; the increasingl y imminen t danger of world war, growin g along with the armament s and threatenin g to "finish off" fou r to five millio n Germans , becaus e the seizur e of Alsace-Lorraine ha s driven Franc e into the arms of Russia , and thus mad e Russi a the arbite r of Europe ; the unparallele d corruption o f the press, throug h which the governmen t systemati -cally swampe d the peopl e with alarmis t lies each time the Reichstag wa s renewed ; the police corruptio n aimed at bribing or forcing th e wife to betray her husband , and the child its father; the syste m of agents provocateurs, a s good as unknow n in German y until tha t time; police despotis m far exceedin g the period before 1848; the shameles s floutin g of all justice by the Germa n courts , with the noble Reich Court leading the way; the outlawin g of the entire workin g class by the Anti-Socialis t Law—al l this has had its 3* day, and a long day at that, thanks to the cowardic e of the German philistine—bu t now it is coming to an end.
The Cartel majority ha s been smashed , smashe d irrevocably , so that only one thing can patch it up even for a single moment— a coup de force.
What now ? Botch togethe r a new majorit y for the old system ? Oh, ther e would be enthusias m for this, and not only in the Government.
Amongs t the Freisinnige 8 there are enough jitterer s who woul d themselve s play at the Cartel rather than let the wicked Socia l Democrat s in — the dream s of suitabilit y for govern -ment, burie d togethe r with Frederic k III, are rappin g once again on the coffin-lid .
But the Governmen t has no use for liberalism , and it is not yet ripe for an allianc e with the Junker s from east of the Elbe , and they, after all, are the most importan t class in the Empire! And the Centre ? In the Centre , too, there are Junker s en masse, Westphalian, Bavaria n and so on, who burn with desire to sink into the arms of their brother s east of the Elbe, who voted with relish fo r the taxes favourin g the Junkers ; and in the Centre too there ar e enoug h bourgeoi s reactionarie s who want to go even further bac k than the Governmen t can—who , if they could, would impose upo n us once more the entire Middle Ages complet e with guilds.
A specificall y Catholi c party, after all, like any specificall y Christian party , can be nothin g else but reactionary .
So why not a new Carte l with the Centre ? Simply becaus e it is not Catholicis m which actuall y holds the Centre together , but hatred of the Prussians.
I t is compose d exclu-sively of element s hostile to the Prussians , which are strongest , of course, i n the Catholi c areas; Rhinelan d peasants , petty bourgeoi s and workers , South Germans , Hanoveria n and Westphalia n Catholics.
Aroun d the Centre are groupe d the other bourgeoi s and peasan t anti-Prussia n elements : the Guelph s and other particularists, th e Poles, the Alsatians.
9 The very day the Centre becomes th e party of government , it will fall apart into a portion composed o f Junkers , guildsme n and reactionarie s and a portion consisting o f peasant s and democrats ; and the gentleme n in the first portio n know that they will not be able to show themselve s to their elector s again.
Despite this, the attemp t will be made, despite this the majorit y of the Centre will be ready for an accommoda -tion.
An d we can have no objectio n to this.
This specificall y anti-Prussian Catholi c party was itself a product of the Bismarc k era, the rule of what is specificall y Prussian .
If the latter should fall, it is only just that the former too should fall.
We may therefor e expect a momentar y allianc e of the Centre and the Government .
But the Centre does not consist of Nationa l Liberals—on th e contrary , it is the first party to emerg e triumphant fro m the struggl e agains t Bismarck , to send him to Canossa.
10 I t will thus certainl y not be a Cartel, and Bismarc k can only use a new Cartel .
So what will happen ? Dissolution .
New elections .
Appeal to the fear of a Social Democrati c tidal wave? It is too late for this as well.
If Bismarc k wanted this, then he would not fall out with his new Empero r even for a moment , still less make a great fuss about this quarrel .
As long as the old William was still alive, the invincibilit y of the Bismarck, Moltke , William triumvirat e was unshakeabl y firm in the eyes of the Germa n philistine .
But now Willia m is gone, Moltke has been made to go, and Bismarc k vacillate s as to whethe r he should b e forced to go, or go by himself.
And the young William who has replace d the old one has proved in the course of his quite short government , and particularl y throug h his renowne d de-crees,11 that respectabl e bourgeoi s philistine s cannot possibl y rely upon him , and also that he will not allow himsel f to be ordere d about.
Th e man in whom the philistine s believe d no longer has the power , and the philistine s cannot believe in the man who has the power .
The old confidenc e in the eternit y of the inner order of the Empir e founde d in 1871 is gone, and no power on earth can restor e it.
The philistine , the last pillar of the old policy, has become shaky .
How can dissolutio n help here? A coup d'état? But this release s not only the people , but also the princes o f the Empir e from their loyalty to the Imperia l Constitution thu s broken ; this means the disintegratio n of the Empire.
A war? Child's play to launch one.
But what would becom e of it once launche d defies the imagination .
Should Croesu s cross the Halys12 or Willia m cross the Rhine , he will destroy a great empire—but which ? His own, or that of the enemy ? It is well known tha t peace persist s only thanks to the unendin g revolutio n in weapon s technology , which preclude s anyone getting ready for war, and thanks to everybody' s fear of the absolutel y incalculabl e prospects o f the only war now still possible , a world war.
Only on e thing can help: an uprising , provoke d by governmen -tal brutalit y and suppresse d with double and triple brutality , a general stat e of siege, and re-electio n in condition s of terror.
Even that woul d only produc e a few years' stay of execution .
But it is the only way—an d we know that Bismarc k is one of those who will stop at nothing .
And did not William too say: At the slightes t resistance I shall have them all shot down? And therefor e this way certainly wil l be applied .
The Germa n Social-Democrati c worker s have just won a triumph, a triumph well earned throug h their tough steadfastness , their iro n discipline , their cheerfu l humou r in battle , their tirelessness; bu t it certainl y came unexpectedly , even to them-selves, an d has astonishe d the world.
The increas e in the Social Democratic vot e in every new electio n has proceede d with the irresistible forc e of a natural process ; brutality , police despotism , judicial despicability—al l these bounce d off withou t effect; the steadily growin g attack force move d forwards , forward s with increasing rapidit y and now stand s there, the second stronges t party in the Empire .
And should the Germa n worker s now spoil their ow n game by allowin g themselve s to be misled into a hopeless putsc h for the sole reason of helping Bismarc k out of his mortal anguish ? At the momen t when their own courage , their courage abov e all praise, is supporte d by the interactio n of all outside circumstances , when the whole social and politica l situa-tion, whe n even all their enemie s have to work for the Social Democrats, a s though they were paid by them—a t this momen t should disciplin e and self-contro l fail, and shoul d we throw ourselves upo n the outstretche d sword? Never! The Anti-Socialis t Law has trained our worker s too well for this, for this we have far too man y old soldier s in our ranks, amongs t them too many who have learne d to stand at order arms in a hail of bullets till the moment i s ripe for the attack.

APRIL, 1890 .
1 Not only Socialists , but every progressiv e party in every countr y of Wester n Europe, 3 has a double interes t in the victory of the Russian Revolutionar y Party.
First, becaus e the Empir e of the Tsar b is the mainsta y of European reaction , its last fortifie d positio n and its great reserve army at once; becaus e its mere passiv e existenc e is a standin g threat an d dange r to us.
Secondly—and thi s point is not now being sufficientl y insiste d upon—because b y its ceaseles s meddlin g in the affairs of the West, it cripple s and disturb s our norma l development , and this with the object of conquerin g geographica l positions , which will assure to Russia the master y over Europe , and thus c crush every chance o f progres s under the iron heel of the Tsar.
It is impossible , in England , to write about Russia n foreig n policy withou t at once recallin g the name of David Urquhart .
For fifty year s he worked indefatigabl y to spread among his country -men a knowledg e of the aims and method s of Russian diplomacy , a subjec t he thoroughl y understood ; and yet, all he got for his pains wa s ridicul e and the reputatio n of an unmitigate d bore.
Now, th e ordinar y Philistin e does indeed class under that head a In Die Neue Zeit the openin g sentenc e begins as follows : "We, the West European workers ' party.

every on e who insists upon unpalatabl e subjects , be they ever so important.
Bu t then, Urquhart , who hated the Philistin e withou t understanding eithe r his nature or his historica l unavoidabilit y for the time being, was bound to fail.
A Tory of the old school , with the fact before his eyes that in Englan d the Tories alone had hitherto offere d effectiv e resistanc e to Russia , and that the action of Englis h and foreign Liberals , includin g the whole revolutionar y movement o n the Continent , had generall y led to advantage s gained b y that power, he held that, to really resist Russian inroads , one mus t needs be a Tory (or else a Turk), and that every Libera l and Revolutionis t was, knowingl y or not, a Russian tool.
His constant occupatio n with Russia n diplomac y led him to look upon it as somethin g all-powerful , as indeed the only active agent in modern history , in whose hands all other government s were but passive tools ; so that, but for his equally exaggerate d estimat e of the strengt h of Turkey , one cannot make out why this omnipoten t Russian diplomac y has not got hold of Constantinopl e long ago.
In order thu s to reduc e all moder n histor y since the Frenc h Revolution t o a diplomati c game of chess betwee n Russia and Turkey, wit h the other Europea n States for Russia' s chessmen , Urquhart ha d to set himself up as a sort of Eastern prophe t who taught, instea d of simple historic facts, a secret esoteric doctrin e in a mysteriou s hyper-diplomati c language , full of allusion s to facts not generall y known , but hardly ever plainly stated; and who, as infallible nostrum s agains t the supremac y of Russian over English diplomacy, propounde d the renewe d impeachmen t of Minister s and the substitution , for the Cabinet , of the Privy Council .
Urquhart wa s a man of great merit, and a fine Englishma n of the old schoo l to boot; but Russia n diplomatist s might well say: Si M.
Urquhart n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer.
3 Among th e Russia n Revolutionists , too, there still exists a comparatively grea t ignoranc e of this side of Russia n history .
On the one hand, becaus e in Russia itself only the official legend is tolerated; o n the other, with a great many, because they hold the Government o f the Tsar in too great contempt , believin g it incapable o f anythin g rational , incapable , partly from stupidity , partly fro m corruption .
And for Russia n interna l policy this is a "If Mr.
Urquhar t did not exist, it would be necessar y to invent him.
" In-stead of this paragrap h the Germa n has: "It is to the credit of Karl Marx that he was the first to stress, and repeatedl y did so from 1848, that the West Europea n workers' part y is obliged for this last reason to wage a life-and-deat h war against Russian Tsardom .
In calling for the same, I am merel y continuin g the efforts of my late friend, catchin g up on what he did not live to do.
"— Ed.
right enough ; here the impotenc e of Tsardo m is clear as day.
But we ough t to know not only the weaknes s but the strengt h too of the enemy .
And its foreign policy is unquestionabl y the side on which Tsardo m is strong—ver y strong .
Russian diplomac y forms, to a certain extent , a modern Order of Jesuits , powerfu l enough , if need be, to overcom e even the whims of a Tsar, and to crush corruption withi n its own body, only to spread it the more plenteously abroad ; an Orde r of Jesuit s originall y and by preference recruite d from foreigners , Corsican s like Pozzo di Borgo, German s like Nesselrode, Russo-Germans a like Lieven , just as its founder , Catherin e II, was a foreigner .
The old Russia n aristocrac y had still too many worldly , private and famil y interests ; they had not the absolut e reliabilit y which the service o f this new order demanded .
And as the persona l poverty and celibac y of the Catholi c Jesuit priest could not be forced upon them, the y had, for the time, to be relegate d to secondar y or representative positions , embassies , &c, and thus graduall y a school o f native diplomat s built up.
Up to the presen t time only one thoroughbre d Russian , Gortschakoff , has filled the highes t post in this order, and his successo r Von Giers again bears a foreign name .
It is this secret order, originall y recruite d from foreig n adventurers, whic h has raised the Russia n Empir e to its presen t power.
Wit h iron perseverance , gaze fixed resolutel y on the goal, shrinking fro m no breach of faith, no treachery , no assassination , no servility , lavishin g bribes in all directions , made arrogan t by no victory, discourage d by no defeat , steppin g over the corpse s of millions o f soldier s and of, at least, one Tsar, 14 this band, unscrupulous a s talented , has done more than all the Russia n armies t o extend the frontier s of Russia from the Dniepe r and Dwina to beyon d the Vistula , to the Pruth, the Danub e and the Black Sea ; from the Don and Volga beyond the Caucasu s and to the source s of the Oxus and Jaxartes ; to make Russia great, powerful, an d dreaded , and to open for her the road to the sovereignty o f the world .
But by doing this it has also strengthened th e power of Tsardo m at home.
To the Jingo public the fam e of victory , the conquest s followin g on conquests , the might an d glamou r of Tsardom , far outweig h all sins, all despotism, al l injustice , and all wanton oppression ; the tall talk of Chauvinism full y compensate s for all humiliation s at home.
And this the more, the less the actual causes and details of these a The Germa n has: "Baltic Germans".
— Ed.
successes ar e known in Russia , and are replace d by an officia l legend, suc h as benevolen t government s everywher e (in Prussi a and France , e.
g.
) inven t for the good of their subjects , and for the greater encouragemen t of patriotism .
Thus the Russia n who is a Chauvinist, wil l sooner or later fall on his knees before the Tsar, as we have seen in the case of Tichomiroff .
But how could such a band of adventurer s manag e to acquir e this enormou s influenc e in Europea n history ? Very simply .
They have no t created somethin g new out of nothing , they have but made th e right use of an existin g situation .
Russian diplomac y has had a very obvious , materia l foundatio n for all its achievements .
Look at Russia in the middle of last century— a colossa l territor y even at that time, people d by a peculiarl y homogeneou s race.
A sparse, bu t rapidly-growin g population ; therefor e an assure d growth o f power with mere lapse of time.
This population , intellectually stagnant , devoid of all initiative , but, within the limits of their traditiona l mode of existence , fit to be used for, and to be moulded into , anything ; tenacious , brave, obedient , contemptuou s of hardshi p and fatigue , unsurpassabl e stuff for soldier s in the wars of that time where the fightin g of compac t masses was decisive.
Th e countr y itself with only one—it s Wester n — side turned toward s Europe , and so only attackabl e on that side; without an y centre , the conques t of which might compel a peace; almost absolutel y safeguarde d agains t conques t by absenc e of roads, immensenes s of surface , and povert y of resources .
Here was a position of impregnabl e strength , ready for any one who knew ho w to use it, whence that might be done with impunity , which woul d have brough t war after war upon any other Government i n Europe .
Strong t o impregnabilit y on the defensiv e side, Russia was correspondingly wea k on the offensive .
The mustering , organisa -tion, equipmen t and movement s of her armies in the interior , met with the greates t obstacles , and to all materia l difficultie s was added th e boundles s corruptio n of the official s and officers .
All attempts t o make Russia capabl e of attack on a large scale have, so far, failed , and probabl y the latest, presen t attempt s to introduc e universal compulsor y conscription, 15 will fail as completely .
One might sa y that the difficultie s grow as the square of the masses to be organised , quite apart from the impossibility , with such a small town population , of finding the enormou s numbe r of officers now required.
Thi s weaknes s has been no secret to Russia n diplomacy ; hence it has, wheneve r possible , avoided war, has only accepte d it as a last resort , and then only under the most favourabl e conditions.
Thos e wars alone suit it in which the allies of Russia have to bear the brunt of the burden , to lay bare their territor y to devastation a s the seat of war, to supply the great mass of combatants, an d in which, to the Russia n troops , falls the rôle of reserve forces .
In that rôle they are generall y spared in battle, but in decisiv e engagements , with relativel y small sacrifices , they reap the glory of turnin g the balanc e of victory , such was their part in the war of 1813-1815.
16 But a war carrie d on under such favourable condition s is not always to be had; hence Russia n diplomacy prefer s to use the antagonisti c interest s and desires of the othe r powers for its own ends, to set these powers by the ears, and to exploi t their enmitie s for the benefit of the Russia n policy of conquest .
Only agains t those who are clearly the weaker — Sweden, Turkey , Persia—doe s Tsardo m fight on its own account , and in these cases it has not to share the spoils with anyone .
But to return to the Russia of 1760.
This homogeneous , unattackable countr y had for neighbour s only countrie s which were actuall y or apparentl y effete, approachin g disintegration , and thus pur e matière à conquêtes.
* In the north, Sweden , whose power and prestig e had been lost just becaus e Charle s XII.
had attempted t o invade Russia , and in doing so had ruined Swede n and mad e eviden t the unattackabilit y of Russia.
In the south, the Turks, and their tributarie s the Crimea n Tartars , wrecks of former greatness ; the offensiv e power of the Turks broken for the last 100 years; their power of defenc e still considerable , but also on the decline ; and as best proof of this growin g weakness , rebel movements amon g the subject Christians , the Slavs, Roumanians , and Greeks , who forme d the majorit y of the populatio n in the Balkan Peninsula .
These Christians , belongin g almost exclusivel y to the Greek Church , were thus akin to the Russian s by faith, and the Slav s amon g them , the Servian s and Bulgarians , were moreover connecte d with them by race.
Russia had therefor e only to proclai m her duty to protec t the oppresse d Greek Churc h and the downtrodde n Slavs, and the field for conquest—unde r the name of "freein g the oppressed" 13—was read y to hand.
In the same wa y there were south of the Caucasu s small Christia n States and Christia n Armenian s under the suzeraint y of Turkey , as whose "saviour" c Tsardo m could pose.
And then, here in the south, a victor's prize like none other Europe could offer, enticed the lustfu l conqueror : the old capita l of the Easter n Roma n a Object for conquest.

c The Germa n has: "liberator", — Ed.
Empire, th e metropoli s of the whole Greco-Catholi c world, the town whos e Russia n name alread y expresse s supremac y over the east and the prestig e which invests its possesso r in the eyes of Eastern Christendo m — Constantinople-Tsaregrad .
Tsaregrad a s the third Russia n capital alongsid e of Moscow and Petersburg: thi s meant not only moral supremac y over Easter n Christendom, i t meant also the decisiv e step toward s supremac y over Europe .
It meant sole comman d of the Black Sea, Asia Minor, th e Balka n Peninsula .
It meant , wheneve r the Tsar pleased, th e closing of the Black Sea to all merchan t vessels and men-of-war excep t Russian , its transformatio n into a Russian Naval Port , and a place of manoeuvr e exclusivel y for the Russia n fleet, whic h from this safe refuge could pass throug h the fortifie d Bosphorus, an d return thithe r as often as it chose.
Then Russia would onl y need to obtain the same command , directl y or indirectly, o f the Sound and the Belts, to becom e unattackabl e at sea also.
Command o f the Balkan Peninsul a would bring Russia as far as the Adriatic .
And this frontie r on the south-wes t would be untenable, unles s the Russia n frontie r were correspondingl y advanced al l along the west, and the spher e of her power considerably extended .
But here the condition s were, if possible , still mor e favourable .
First of all, Poland , completel y disorganised , a republi c of nobles, founde d upon the spoliatio n and oppressio n of the peasants, wit h a constitutio n that made all nationa l action impossible,17 an d thus made the countr y an easy prey for its neighbours.
Sinc e the beginnin g of the century it had existed only, as the Poles themselve s said, throug h disorde r (Polska nierzadem, stoi); the whole countr y was constantl y occupie d and traverse d by foreign troops , who used it as an eating and drinking-hous e (karczma zajezdna, sai d the Poles), in which they usually forgot to pay the bill.
Alread y Peter the Great had systematicall y ruined Poland—here hi s successor s had but to reach out their hand for it.
And to do this they had anothe r pretext—th e "Principl e of Nationalities".
18 Polan d was not a homogeneou s country .
At the time whe n Great Russia came under the Mongolia n yoke, White Russia, an d Little Russia found protectio n agains t the Asiatic invasion, b y unitin g themselve s into the so-calle d Lithuania n Principality.
Thi s Principalit y later on voluntaril y united itself with Poland.
19 Afterwards , in consequenc e of the higher civilizatio n of the Poles , the White and Little Russian nobilit y had becom e largely Polish; an d at the time of the Jesuit supremac y in Poland, 20 in the 16th century , the Greco-Catholi c Poles 3 had been forced into union wit h the Roma n Church .
This gave the Tsars of Great Russia th e welcom e pretex t to claim the forme r Lithuania n territory, a s a land Russia n by nationalit y but now oppresse d by Poland, althoug h the Little Russian s at least, accordin g to the greatest livin g authorit y on Slavoni c languages , Miklosic , do not speak a mere Russia n dialect , but a separat e language ; and the further pretex t for interferenc e as protector s of the Greek faith, for the benefit of the Uniate Greco-Catholics, 21 althoug h these had long sinc e becom e reconcile d to their positio n with regard to the Roman Church .
Beyond Polan d lay anothe r countr y that seemed to have fallen into hopeles s ruin—Germany .
Since the Thirty Years' War, the Holy Roma n Empire b was only nominall y a State.
The positio n of the prince s within the Empir e was more and more approachin g complete sovereignty ; their power of defying the Emperor , which in German y replace d the Polish liberum veto, 22 had been, by the Peace of Westphalia, 23 expressl y placed under the guarante e of France an d of Sweden ; a strengthenin g of the central power was therefore mad e dependen t on the assent of the foreigner , whose direct interes t it was to preven t anythin g like it.
In additio n to this, Sweden, thank s to her Germa n conquests , was a membe r of the German Empire , with seat and vote at the Imperia l Diets.
In every war the Empero r encountere d Germa n Prince s of the Empir e among th e allies of his foreign foes; every war was therefor e a civil war.
Almos t all the larger and secondar y Prince s of the Empir e had bee n bough t by Louis XIV.
, and the countr y was so ruined economically that , withou t the annua l influx of French bribe-money, i t would have been impossibl e to keep money at all in the country fo r use as a circulatin g medium.
* The Empero r had, therefore, lon g since sought his strengt h not within his Empire , which onl y cost him mone y and brough t him nothin g but worry and vexation , but in his Austrian , German , and extra-Germa n dominions.
An d side by side with the power of Austria as distinc t from Germany , the Prussia n power was already rising as rival.
Such wa s the positio n of things in German y in the time of Peter the Great .

—wa s the first who thoroughl y graspe d the wonderfull y favourabl e conditio n of Europe for Russian ends.
Not only in respec t to Sweden , Turkey , Persia, Poland , did he see clearly—far mor e clearly than appear s from his so-calle d Testa-ment, whic h seems the work of an epigone 24—the mai n points of Russian policy ; he firmly fixed it, and began to carry it out.
He did the same in respec t to Germany .
He concerne d himsel f far more wit h German y than any countr y except Sweden .
Sweden he must break ; Poland he could have wheneve r he chose to stretch out his hand; Turkey was still too far away from him; but to set a firm foo t in Germany , to obtain the positio n which France used so fully, an d which Swede n was too weak to use, that was his chief task.
He did everythin g to becom e a Germa n Prince of the Empire, b y the acquisitio n of Germa n territory , but in vain; he could onl y initiat e the system of intermarriag e with Germa n Princes, an d the diplomati c exploitatio n of the interna l dissension s of Germany .
Since Peter' s time the positio n of things had becom e still more favourable t o Russia throug h the rise of Prussia .
This gave the German Emperor , within the Empir e itself, an antagonis t almost his equal , who perpetuate d the division s of German y and brough t them to a head.
And at the same time this antagonis t was still weak enoug h to be dependen t upon the help of France or of Russia, especiall y of Russia , so that the more he emancipate d himself fro m his vassalag e with regard to the Germa n Empire , the more surel y did he sink into the vassalag e of Russia .
Thus ther e remaine d in Europ e only three Power s to be considered: Austria , France , England .
And to set these by the ears, or to bribe them with the bait of new territory , was no difficul t matter.
Englan d and France were still, as ever, rivals on the sea; France wa s to be got by the prospec t of the acquisitio n of territor y in Belgiu m and Germany ; Austri a could be bribed by danglin g before he r eyes advantage s to be gained at the expens e of France , Prussia, and , since the time of Joseph IL, of Bavaria .
Here then, by the adroit use of conflictin g interests , were strong, overwhelm -ingly stron g allies to be had for any diplomati c move of Russia .
And now , face to face with these frontie r lands in full disruption , face to face with three great Powers , whose traditions , economi c conditions, politica l or dynasti c interests , and lust after conquest , involved the m in endles s dispute s and kept them occupie d in outwitting on e the other , here was the one homogeneous , youthful, rapidly-growin g Russia , hardly attackable , and absolutel y unconquerable, an d at the same time an unworked , almos t unresisting, plasti c raw material .
What an opportunit y for people of talent and ambition , for people strivin g after power, no matter how or where, so long only as the power was real, so long as it provided a real arena for their talent and ambition ! And the "enlightened" 18t h Centur y produce d such people in numbers : people wh o in the service of "Humanity " traverse d all Europe , visited th e Courts of all enlightene d Princes—an d what Prince then but wished to be "enlightened",—wh o settled down whereve r they foun d a favourabl e spot, a semi-aristocratic , semi-middleclass, a denationalized Internationa l of "Enlightenment" .
This Interna -tional fel l on its knees before the Semirami s of the North, one equally denationalized , Sophi a August a of Anhalt, called Jekaterina II .
of Russia , and it was from the ranks of this International tha t this same Catherin e drew the element s for her Jesuit orde r of Russia n diplomacy.
15 Let us now see how this order of Jesuits works, how it uses the ever-changing aim s of the rival Powers as a means for obtainin g its one aim—neve r changing , never lost sight of—th e World -Supremacy o f Russia .
II Never wer e things c more favourabl e to the plans for the aggrandisement o f Tsardo m than in 1762, when, after murderin g her husband , the "great whore" , Catherin e ascende d the throne .
All Europ e was split up into two camps by the Seven Years' War.
25 England ha d broke n the power of France , on the high seas, in America, i n India, and now left her continenta l ally, Frederic k II.
of Prussia , to shift for himself .
The latter, in 1762, was on the brink of destruction , when suddenl y Peter III.

4-1550 England, wit h Austri a and France permanentl y hostile , exhauste d by a seven years' struggl e for existence , Frederic k had no choice but to throw himsel f at the feet of the newly-crowne d Tsarina .
This assure d him not only a powerfu l protection , but the promis e of that part of Poland that divided Easter n Prussia from the main body of his kingdom , and the conques t of which now becam e the one aim of his life.
On the 31st March (11th April), 1764, Catherin e and Frederic k signed a treaty of allianc e at Petersburg, 26 the secret article of which boun d both to maintain , if need bea by force of arms, the existing Polis h Constitutio n — that best means of ruining Poland — against ever y attemp t at reform .
With this the future partitio n of Poland wa s sealed .
A piece of Poland was the bone which the Tsarina thre w to the Prussia n dog, b so that he might quietly submit t o be chaine d up by Russia for a century .
I shall not go into the details of the first partitio n of Poland.
27 But it is characteristi c that it was carried out, against the wish of the old-fashione d Maria Theresa , by the three great pillars of European "enlightenment" , Catherine , Frederick , and Joseph .
The two latter, proud of the superio r statesmanshi p with which they trample d upon the superstitio n of a traditiona l law of nations , were yet stupid enoug h not to see how, by sharin g in the Polish booty, the y had signed themselve s over, body and soul, to Russia n Tsardom.
Nothing coul d have been more useful to Catherin e than these "enlightened" princel y neighbour s of hers.
"Progress " and c "enlightenment" wer e the parrot-cr y of Russia n Tsardo m in Europe durin g the eighteent h century , just as the deliveranc e of enslaved0 nation s is in the nineteenth .
No spoliation , no violence , no oppressio n on the part of Tsardom, bu t has been perpetrate d under pretex t of "progress", e "enlightenment", "Liberalism" , "the deliveranc e of the oppres -sed".

Imagin e the contemp t with which such a Russian diplomatis t looks down upon the "cultured " Occident.
After Polan d it was the turn of Germany .
Austria and Prussi a came to loggerhead s in the Bavaria n Successio n War, 1778, 29 and again to the advantag e of no one but Catherine .
Russia had grown too big to speculat e any longer , as Peter had done, b upon enterin g the Germa n Empir e by acquirin g some small Germa n principality .
She now aimed at obtainin g the positio n she alread y held in Poland, an d which France possesse d in the Germa n Empire—tha t of guarante e of Germa n anarch y agains t every attemp t at reform .
And this positio n she attained .
At the Peace of Teschen , 1779, Russia, togethe r with France , undertoo k the guarante e of this Treaty, an d of all former Treatie s of Peace therein confirmed , more especiall y the Peace of Westphali a of 1648.
With this the impotence o f German y was signed and sealed , and she was marked ou t for future partitio n betwee n France and Russia .
Turkey wa s not forgotten .
Russia n wars with Turke y alway s occur in those times when there is peace on Russia' s wester n frontier, and , if possible , when Europ e is occupie d elsewhere .
Catherine wage d two such wars.
The first resulte d in conquest s by the Sea of Azov, and in the independenc e of the Crimea ; four years later , that country was transforme d into a Russian Province .
The secon d extende d the Russia n frontie r from the Bug to the Dniester.
Durin g both these wars Russian agents had egged on the Greeks t o rebel agains t Turkey .
Of course , the rebels were eventually lef t in the lurch by the Russia n Government.
30 During th e America n War of Independence , Catherin e for the first tim e formulated , for herself and her allies, what was called the Northern 0 "arme d neutrality " (1780) , the deman d for the limitation o f the rights claime d by Englan d in time of war for her navy on the high seas.
These demand s have remaine d ever since the constan t aim of Russia n policy ; they were, in the main, conceded b y Europe , and consente d to by Englan d herself, in the a The Germa n has "enlightened " instead of "advanced".

Peace of Paris of 1856.
31 The United States of Americ a alone will none of it.
The outbrea k of the French Revolutio n was anothe r windfal l for Catherine.
Fa r from fearin g the revolutionar y ideas might spread to Russia , she saw in the Revolutio n only a new opportunit y of setting th e other Europea n States by the ears, so that Russia might have a free hand.
After the death of her two "enlightened " friends an d neighbours, 2 Frederic k Willia m II.
in Prussi a and Leopold i n Austri a tried b an independen t policy .
The Re-volution gav e Catherin e the best possibl e opportunity—o n a pretext o f combatin g Republica n France—o f again chainin g both of them to Russia , and at the same time, while they were busy on the Frenc h frontier , of making fresh inroad s upon Poland .
Both Austria an d Prussia walked into the trap.
And althoug h Prussia — which fro m 1787-179 1 had played the part of ally of Poland against Catherine—jus t in the nick of time though t better of it, and on this occasio n claime d a larger share in the Polish spoil, and although Austria , too, had to be square d with a slice of Poland , yet Catherine wa s again able to lay hands on the greates t part of the plunder32; almos t the whole of White Russia and of Little Russia were unite d to Great Russia .
But this tirne there was a reverse side to the medal.
While the plundering o f Poland took up, in 1792-94, 33 part of the strengt h of the Coalition , it weakene d their power to attack France , until France wa s strong enough , single-handed , to achiev e victory .
Poland fell , but her resistanc e had saved the French Revolution, 34 and the French Revolutio n started a movemen t against which even Tsardom i s powerless .
And for this, we, in the West, shall never forget Poland .
Nor is this—a s we shall see—th e only occasio n on which th e Poles have saved the Europea n Revolution .
In the policy of Catherin e we find all the chief points of the Russian polic y of to-day sharpl y defined : the annexatio n of Poland, eve n thoug h for a time part of the plunde r must be handed ove r to her neighbours ; the markin g out of German y for the next spoil; Constantinople , the great, never-to-be-forgotten , slowly-to-be-attained, fina l goal; the conques t of Finlan d as a protection t o Petersburg ; Swede n to be indemnifie d by Norway , which Catherin e offered to Gustavu s III.
35 at Fredrikshamn ; the weakening o f British supremac y on the seas, by internationa l treaty-limitations; th e stirrin g up revolt among the Christia n and a Frederic k II and Joseph II.

At the death of Catherine , Russia already possesse d more than the wildes t nationa l Chauvinis m could have asked for.
All who bore the »Russia n name , barrin g only the few Austria n Little Russians, wer e under the sceptre of her successor, 3 who had now a perfect righ t to call himself Autocra t of all the Russians .
Not only had the approac h to the sea been gained ; on the Baltic as on the Black Sea Russia possesse d a broad littéral and numerous harbours .
Not only Finns, Tartars , and Mongolians , but Lithuanians, Swedes , Poles, and German s were under Russia n dominion.
Wha t more do you desire ? To any other nation this would have sufficed .
For Russia n diplomacy—the natio n was not consulted—thi s was only the stepping-stone t o other conquests .
The Frenc h Revolutio n had worn itself out, and had brough t forth it s own dictator— a Napoleon .
Thereb y it had to all appearance justifie d the superio r wisdom of Russia n diplomacy , which ha d not allowed itself to be intimidate d by the huge revolt.
b The ris e of Napoleo n now gave it the opportunit y for new successes.
Germany wa s nearin g the fate of Poland .
But Catherine' s successor, Paul , was obstinate , capricious , unreliable ; he was constantly thwartin g the action of Russia n diplomacy ; he becam e unbearable, h e had to be got rid of.
It was easy enough to find the necessary officer s of the Guard s to do this: the heir to the Crown , Alexander, wa s in the plot, and served as cloak to it.
Paul was strangled, an d immediatel y a fresh campaig n was begun to the greater honou r and glory of the new Tsar, who throug h the manner o f his accessio n had becom e the life-lon g slave of the diplomatic ban d of Jesuits .
They lef t it to Napoleo n to completel y break up the Germa n Empire, an d to push to a crisis the confusio n existin g there.
But when it came to the settling of account s Russia again steppe d in.
The peac e of Lunevill e (1801) 36 had given France the whole left c bank of the Rhine , on conditio n that the Germa n Prince s thus dispossessed shoul d be indemnifie d on the right bank out of the possessions o f the spiritua l member s of the Empire , Bishopries , a Paul I.

Now Russia insiste d upon her positio n of guarantee , won at Tesche n in 1779 37: in the parcellin g out of this indemnit y she and France , the two guarantee s of Germa n Imperia l disunio n and decay, 3 clearly had a weighty word to say.
And the dissension , greed, an d genera l infamy b of the Germa n Prince s took care that this word of Russia and of France should be decisive .
Thus it came about tha t Russia and France drew up a plan for the divisio n of the spiritua l princes ' lands among the dispossesse d potentates , and that this plan, drawn up by the foreigner , in the interes t of the foreigner, was , in all essential s made part and parcel of the German Imperia l constitutio n by the Reichs-Deputations -Hauptschluss, 1803.
38 The Germa n Empire 0 was practicall y dissolved ; Austri a and Prussia acte d as independen t Europea n states, and, like Russia and France, looke d upon the small Germa n States simply as a field for conquest.
Wha t was to becom e of these small States? Prussia was still too small and too young to lay claim to supremac y over them, and Austri a had just lost the last trace of such supremacy .
But both Russi a and France put in a claim for the inheritanc e of the German Empire .
France had destroye d the old Empir e by force of arms; she presse d upon the small States by her immediat e neighbourhood al l along the Rhine; the fame of the victorie s of Napoleon an d the French armies did the rest toward s throwin g the smal l Germa n Prince s at her feet.
And Russia ? Now that the end for which she had been strivin g just a hundre d years was almost withi n reach, now that German y lay completel y disinteg -rated, exhauste d unto death, helpless , impotent , should Russia just at this momen t let her prey be snatche d from under her very nose by the Corsica n upstart ? Russian diplomac y at once entere d upon a campaig n for the conquest o f supremac y over the small Germa n States .
That this was impossibl e withou t a victory over Napoleo n was self-evident .
It was therefor e necessar y to win over the Germa n Princes , and the so-called publi c opinio n of Germany—s o far as it could then be said to exist.
The Prince s were worke d upon by diplomatic , the Philistine b y literar y means .
While cajolery , threats , lies and bribery wer e soon broadcas t at the Courts , the public was deluge d with mysteriou s pamphlets , in which Russia was belaude d as the a The Germa n has "ruin" instead of "disunio n and decay".

only Powe r that could save German y and give her effectiv e protection, an d whose right and duty it moreove r was to do this by virtue of the Treaty of Tesche n of 1779.
And when the war of 1805 brok e out, it must have been clear to anyon e whose eyes were at all open, that the only questio n was whethe r the small States shoul d form a French or a Russian Confederac y of the Rhine.
The fate s favoure d Germany .
The Russian s and Austrian s were beaten a t Austerlitz , and the new Confederac y of the Rhine was formed, bu t anyhow , it was not an outpos t of Tsardom.
39 The French yoke , at least, was a modern one; at all events it forced the disgraceful Germa n Prince s to do away with the most crying infamies o f their former politica l system.
3 After Austerlit z came the Prusso-Russia n alliance , Jena, Eylau, Friedland, and the Peace of Tilsit in 1807.
40 Here again was shown what an immens e advantag e Russia has in her strategicall y safe position.
Defeate d in two campaigns , she gained new territor y at the expens e of her former ally, and the alliance with Napoleo n for the sharin g of the world: for Napoleo n the West, for Alexande r the East ! The firs t fruit of this allianc e was the conques t of Finland .
Without an y declaratio n of war, but with the assent of Napoleon , the Russian s advanced ; the incapacity , discord , and corruptio n of the Swedis h general s secure d an easy victory ; the daring march of Russian troop s across the frozen Baltic compelle d a violent change of dynast y at Stockholm , and the surrende r of Finland to Russia.
41 But whe n three years later the breach betwee n Alexande r and Napoleon wa s impending , the Tsar summone d Marsha l Berna-dotte, th e newly-electe d Crown Prince of Sweden , to Abo, and promised hi m Norwa y if he would join the league of Englan d and Russia agains t Napoleon.
42 Thus it was that in 1814 the plan of Catherine wa s carried out.
b But Finlan d was only the prelude .
The real object of Alexande r was, as ever, Constantinople .
At Tilsit and at Erfurt, 43 Moldavi a and Wallachi a had been unconditionall y promise d him by Napoleon, an d the prospec t held out of a partitio n of Turkey , from which , however , Constantinopl e was to be excluded .
Since 1806 Russi a had been at war with Turkey , and this time not only the Greeks , but the Servian s too had rebelled.
44 But what has been said erroneousl y with regar d to Poland , is true of Turkey .

Disorganisation save d it.
The sturdy commo n soldier , the son of the sturd y Turkis h peasant , found in this very disorganisatio n a means o f making good the evil done by the corrup t Pashas .
The Turks coul d be beaten but not subdued , and the Russia n army advanced bu t slowly on its way toward s the Bosphorus.
3 The price , however , for this "free hand" in the East was the acceptance o f Napoleon' s Continenta l System , the suspensio n of all trade wit h England.
45 And this meant, to the Russia of that time, commercial ruin .
This was the time when Eugen e Onegi n (in Pushkin's epic ) learnt from Adam Smith how a nation grows wealthy, an d how it has no need of money so long as it possesse s plenty o f the produc e of labour .
While, on the other hand, his father coul d not see it, and had to mortgag e one estate after another.
15 Russia coul d only get money by maritim e commerce , and by the export o f her nationa l products 0 to England , then the chief market; an d Russia was now far too much occidentalise d to do without money .
The commercia l blockad e becam e unbearable .
Political Econom y proved more powerfu l than Diplomac y and the Tsar put together ; intercours e with Englan d was quietly resumed , the term s of the Tilsit Treaty were broken , and the war broke out in 1812.
Napoleon, wit h the combine d armies of the whole of the West, crossed th e Russia n frontier .
The Poles, who were in a position to know, advise d him to halt by the Dwina and the Dnieper , to organise Poland , and there to await the Russia n attack.
A general of the calibre of Napoleo n must have known that this was the right plan .
But Napoleon , standin g on that giddy height with its insecure foundation , could n o longe r ventur e on a protracte d campaign.
Immediat e successes , dazzlin g victories , treaties of peace taken by assault , were indispensabl e to him.
He cast the Polish advice to the winds, went to Moscow , and so brough t the Russian s to Paris.
The destructio n of the great armies of Napoleon , on the retreat from Moscow , gave the signal for a universa l uprisin g agains t the French supremac y in the West.
In Prussi a the whole nation rose, and force d coward Frederic k William III.

after Napoleon' s entry into Moscow , Alexande r entered Paris, the lord and maste r of Europe .
Turkey, betraye d by France , had signed a peace at Buchares t in 1812, and sacrifice d Bessarabi a to Russia.
The Congres s of Vienna gave Russi a the kingdo m of Poland, 48 so that now almos t nine-tenths o f what had been Polish territor y were annexe d to Russia.
Bu t more importan t than all this was the positio n which the Tsar now occupie d in Europe .
He had now no rival on the Continent.
H e had Austri a and Prussi a in tow.
The Frenc h Bourbon dynast y had been re-installe d by him, and was therefor e equally obedient .
Swede n had receive d Norwa y from him as reward fo r her friendl y policy 49; even the Spanis h dynast y owed its restoratio n far more to the victorie s of the Russians , Prussians , and Austrians , than to those of Wellington , which, after all, never could hav e overthrow n the Frenc h Empire .
Never before had Russia hel d so commandin g a position .
But she had taken anothe r step beyon d her natura l frontiers .
If Russia n Chauvinis m has some—I wil l not say justification—bu t some sort of excuse for the conquests o f Catherine , there can be nothin g of the kind with regard t o those of Alexander .
Finlan d is Finnish and Swedish , Bessarabia Roumanian , the kingdo m of Poland 3 Polish.
Here there is no longer any questio n of the union of scattere d and kindre d races, all bearing the name of Russians ; here we see nothin g but barefaced conques t of alien territor y by brute force, nothin g but simple theft .
Ill The downfal l of Napoleo n meant the victory of the Europea n monarchies ove r the Frenc h Revolution , whose last phase had been the Napoleoni c Empire .
This victory was celebrate d by the restoration o f "Legitimacy" .
Talleyran d fancie d he was taking in the Tsar Alexande r with this phrase , coined expressl y for the purpose; bu t in reality it was Russian Diplomac y that by means of it led all Europe by the nose.
Under the pretex t of defendin g Legitimacy, Russia n Diplomac y founde d the "Holy Alliance" , that expansion o f the Russo-Austro-Prussia n Leagu e into a conspirac y of all Europea n sovereign s agains t their peoples , under the presidency o f Russia.
50 The other princes believe d in it; what the Tsar and his diplomatist s though t of it we shall see directly .
Their nex t move was to take advantag e of their newly-acquire d a The Germa n has "the Poland of the Congress " instead of "the Kingdo m of Poland".

supremacy, b y advancin g a step nearer Constantinople .
To this end they could employ three levers; the Roumanians , the Servians , the Greeks .
The Greek s were the most promisin g element .
They were a commercia l people , and the merchant s suffere d most from the oppressio n of Turkis h Pashas .
The Christia n peasan t under Turkish rul e was materiall y better off than anywher e else.
He had retained hi s pre-Turkis h institutions , and complet e self-government; s o long as he paid his taxes, the Turk, as a rule, took no notic e of him; he was but seldom expose d to acts of violence , such as the peasan t of Wester n Europ e had had to bear in the Middle Age s at the hands of the nobles.
It was a degrade d kind of existence, a life on sufferance , but materiall y anythin g but wretched, and , on the whole , not unsuite d to the state of civilisation o f these peoples ; it took therefor e a long time before these Sla v Rajahs discovere d that this existenc e was intolerable .
On the othe r hand, the commerc e of the Greeks , since Turkis h rule had free d them from the crushin g competitio n of Venetian s and Genoese, ha d rapidl y thriven , and had becom e so considerabl e that it coul' now bear Turkis h rule no longer .
In point of fact, Turkish, lik e all Orienta l rule, is incompatibl e with Capitalis t Society; th e appropriate d surplus-valu e is not safe from the hands of rapaciou s Satrap s and Pashas ; the first fundamenta l conditio n of profitabl e trading 3 is wanting—securit y for the person and property o f the merchant .
No wonder , then, that the Greeks , who had twic e revolte d since 1774, should now rise again.
51 The Gree k rebellio n then furnishe d the handle ; but in order to enable Russia n Diplomac y to apply the necessar y pressure , the West mus t be prevente d from interfering , and must therefor e be provided wit h other work at home.
And here the phrase of "Legitimacy" ha d brilliantl y prepare d the way.
The "Legitimate " rulers ha d made themselve s heartil y hated everywhere .
Their attempts t o reinstat e pre-revolutionar y condition s had stirred up the Bourgeoisi e throughou t the whole of the West; in France and Germany, thing s were in a ferment ; in Spain and Italy, open rebellion brok e out.
52 Russia n Diplomac y had a finger in the pie in all these conspiracie s and rebellions .
Not that it had made them, or even materiall y aided in their momentar y successes .
But what it could do , throug h its officiou s agents, b to sow disconten t and disaffection amon g the subject s of its Legitimis t allies, that it did.

And it openly protecte d the rebel element s in the West, wheneve r and whereve r they appeare d under the mask of sympath y with Greece; th e Philhellene s who collecte d funds, sent volunteer s and fully arme d corps to Greece , what were they but the Carbonar i and othe r Liberal s of the West? All of which did not preven t the enlightene d Tsar Alexande r at the Congresse s of Aix-la-Chapelle, Troppau, Laibach , Verona , from urgin g his Legitimis t allies to act energeticall y agains t their rebellious subjects , and from sendin g the Austrian s in 1821 to Italy, an d the French in 1823 to Spain, to suppres s the revolutio n there53; and from even apparentl y condemnin g the Greek rebellion, whil e at the same time he kept stirrin g it up, and encouraging th e Philhellene s of the West to redouble d efforts .
Once agai n stupid Europ e was befoole d in an incredibl e fashion .
To the Prince s and the Reactionaries , Tsardo m preache d Legiti-macy an d the maintainin g of the status quo*; t o the Libera l Philistine, th e deliveranc e of oppresse d nations b—and bot h believed it .
The Frenc h Ministe r at Verona , the romanticis t Chateaubriand , was completel y captivate d by the Tsar, who seduce d the French by the prospec t of recoverin g the left bank of the Rhine, if only they would be obedien t and stick to Russia.
With this hope, subsequent -ly strengthene d by bindin g pledge s under Charle s X.

Hence, th e failur e of all Russia n attempt s to invad e the Danubian Province s with the tacit consen t of Europe , and thus to force Turke y to capitulate.
3 Just then, in 1825, help came to Turkey fro m Egypt ; the Greeks were everywher e beaten and the revolt almos t suppressed .
Russia n policy was face to face with either a defeat, or else a bold resolve .
The Chancellor , Nesselrode, took counci l with his Ambassadors .
Pozzo di Borgo in Paris (Dispatc h of 4-16th October , 1825), and Lieven i n Londo n (Dispatc h of 18-30t h October , 1825), declare d unreservedly fo r a bold move; the Danubia n Province s must at once, and withou t any regard to Europe , be occupied , even at the risk of a Europea n war.
This was evidentl y the universa l opinio n of Russia n Diplomacy .
But Alexande r was limp, capricious , blasé, mystico-romantic; h e had of the Grec du Bas Empire b (as Napoleon calle d him) not only the cunnin g and deceit, but also the irresolution an d want of energy .
He began to take Legitimac y seriously, an d seeme d to have had enoug h of Greek rebellion .
During thi s critical period / he travelle d about in the South, near Taganrog, inactiv e and at that time, before railways , almost inaccessible.
Suddenl y the news came that he was dead.
There were whisper s of poison .
Had Diplomac y got rid of the son as it had of the father ? At any rate, he could not have died more opportunely.
With Nicola s a Tsar came to the throne , than whom no better could hav e been desire d by Diplomacy— a conceite d mediocrity , whose horizo n never exceede d that of a compan y officer , a man who mistoo k brutalit y for energy , and obstinac y in capric e for strength o f will, d who prized beyond everythin g the mere show o f power, an d who, therefore , by the mere show of it, could be got to do anything .
Now more energeti c measure s were resorte d to, and the war against Turkey brough t about.
Europe did not interfere .
England, b y means of Libera l talk, France , by means of the promises alread y mentioned , had been induce d to combin e their Mediterranean fleet s with the Russian , and, on the 20th October , 1827, in the midst of peace, to attack and destro y the Turco -Egyptian fleet , at Navarino.
54 And if Englan d soon drew back, a The Germa n has: "The war in Greece continue d with alternatin g success , whilst all Russia n attempt s to invade the Danubia n Province s with authoritativ e Europea n approval, an d thus force Turke y to capitulate , failed".

While the Tsar declare d war upon Turkey , and his troops crossed the Pruth on the 6th of May, 1828, 15,000 Frenc h troops were getting ready to embar k for Greece, wher e they landed in Augus t and September .
This was sufficient warnin g for Austria , not to fall upon the flank of the Russian advanc e on Constantinople : a war with France would have been the result, and the Russo-Frenc h bond—Constantinopl e for the one, the left bank of the Rhine for the other—woul d then have com e into effect.
At the head of the Russia n army, 3 Diebitsc h advance d as far as Adrianople, bu t there found himsel f in such a position that he would hav e had to re-cros s the Balkan if the Turks could have held out anothe r fortnight .
He had only 20,000 men, of whom a fourth wer e down with the plague .
Then the Prussia n Embass y at Constantinople manage d to negotiat e a peace by lying report s as to a threatening , but really quite impossible , Russian advance .
The Russian Genera l was, in Moltke' s words, "saved fro m a position which perhap s needed only to be prolonge d a few days to hurl him from the height of victory to the abyss of destruction" .

) Anyhow, th e Peace gave Russia the mouth s of the Danube , a slice of territor y in Armenia , and ever new pretext s for meddlin g in the affairs of the Danubia n Provinces.
55 These now became , till the Crimea n War, the karczma zajezdna (eating-house ) for Russia n troops, fro m whom , during this period , they were scarcel y ever free.
Before thes e advantage s could be further turned to account , the Revolution o f July broke out.
56 Now the Liberal phrase-mongerin g of the Russia n agents was, for a while, pocketed ; it was only a question no w of safeguardin g "Legitimacy" .
A campaig n of the Holy Allianc e agains t France was being prepare d when the Polish Insurrection brok e out, and for a year held Russia in check.
Thus, for the second time, did Poland , by her own self-immolation , save the Europea n Revolution.

60 In the main, however , this period was devote d to the conques t and Russification of the Caucasus , a task accomplishe d only after a struggle o f twenty years.
A severe mishap , however , befell the diplomac y of Tsardom .
When th e Grand Duke Constantine , on the 29th November , 1830, had to fly from Warsa w before the Polish insurgents , the whole of his diplomati c archive s fell into their hands; the despatche s of the Foreign Minister / and officia l copies of all the importan t despatches o f the Ambassadors .
The whole machiner y of Russia n diplomacy, an d all the intrigue s woven by itd from 1825 to 1830, were laid bare.
The Polish Governmen t sent Count Zamoysk i with these despatche s to Englan d and Franc e in 1835.
On the instigation o f William IV.
they were publishe d by David Urquhar t in the "Portfolio".
6 This "Portfolio " is still one of the chief sources, an d certainl y the most incontestibl e one, for the history of the intrigue s by which Tsaris h diplomac y seeks to arouse quarrel s among th e nations of the West, and by means of these dissension s to make tools of them all.
Russian diplomac y had by this time weathere d so many Western-European revolutions , not only withou t loss, but with actual gain , that she was in a position to hail the outbrea k of the Revolution o f February , 1848, as a fresh piece of good luck.

, of his hankerin g after independenc e from Russia — what coul d be more welcome ? Russia was safe from all infection , and Polan d was so strongl y garrisone d that she could not move.
And whe n now the revolutio n actuall y spread as far as the Danubian Principalities, 61 Russia n diplomac y had what it wanted — a pretex t for a new invasio n of Moldavi a and Wallachia , there to re-establish orde r and consolidat e Russia n rule.
But this was not enough .
Austria—th e most stubborn , the most dogged opponen t of Russia on the side of the Balkan Peninsula — Austria ha d been brough t to the verge of ruin by the Hungaria n and Viennes e insurrections .
The victory of Hungar y was, however , synonymous wit h a renewed outbrea k of the Europea n Revolution , and the numerou s Poles in the Hungaria n army were so many pledges tha t this revolutio n should not again halt at the Russia n frontier.
The n Nicola s played the magnanimous .
He sent his armies t o overru n Hungary ; he crushe d the Hungaria n forces by superior numbers , and thus sealed the defeat of the Europea n Revolution.
An d as Prussia was still making efforts to use the revolution fo r setting aside the Germa n Confederation , and for bringing a t least the smalle r North Germa n States under her supremacy, Nicola s summone d Prussi a and Austri a before his judgment-seat a t Warsaw , and decide d in favour of Austria.
62 Prussia, a s a reward for her long years of subservienc y to Russia , was ignominiousl y humiliated , because , for a moment , she had shown feebl e Velleitie s of resistance .

63 Not only Hungary , the whole of Europe , lay at the feet of the Tsar, and that it lay there was a direct consequenc e of the Revolution .
Was not Russian diplomac y right, then, if it secretly rejoice d over revolutions i n the West? But the Revolutio n of Februar y was, after all, the first death-knell o f Tsardom .

Th e Crimea n war broke out: Englan d and France came to the rescue of Turkey ; Austria was burnin g to "étonner le monde par la grandeur de son ingratitude".
a For Austria knew that in return fo r the help in the Hungaria n war, and for the Warsa w judgment, sh e was expecte d to remain neutral , or even to facilitat e Russian conquest s on the Danube , conquest s which meant the hemming i n of Austria by Russia , on the north, the east, and the south, fro m Craco w to Orsova and Semlin .
And this time, for once in a way, Austria had the courag e of her opinion .
The Crimea n War was one colossa l Comed y of Errors, in which one constantl y asks oneself: Qui trompe-t-on ici^ whic h is the dupe? But this comedy cost countles s treasure s and over a million human lives.
Hardly had the first allied detachment s reache d Bulgari a when th e Austrian s moved forwar d into the Danubia n Provinces , and the Russian s retired beyond the Pruth.
By this means Austria had, on the Danube , slipped in betwee n the two belligerents ; a continuance o f the war on this side was only possibl e with her consent.
Bu t Austria was to be had for the purpos e of a war on the wester n frontie r of Russia .
Austria knew Russia would never forgive he r brutal ingratitude ; Austria was therefor e ready to join the Allies , but only for a real war, which should restore Poland , and considerabl y push back the wester n frontie r of Russia.
Such a war mus t also make impossibl e the neutralit y of Prussia, 0 throug h whose territor y Russia receive d her supplies ; a Europea n Coalitio n would hav e blockade d Russia by land as well as by sea, and would have attacke d her with such superio r forces that victory was certain.
But this was by no means the intentio n of Englan d and France .
Both, on the contrary , were glad to be freed from the danger of a serious an d real war by Austria' s action.
What Russia wished , that the Allie s should go to the Crime a and get themselve s stuck fast there, Palmersto n propose d and Louis Napoleo n eagerl y jumpe d at.
To push forwar d into the interio r of Russia from the Crimea , would hav e been strategica l madness .
So the war was happil y turned int o a sham war, to the intense satisfactio n of the parties most interested .
But the Tsar Nicolas could not, in the long run, a "Astoun d the world by the grandeu r of her ingratitude"— a phrase ascribe d to Felix Schwarzenberg , the head of the Austria n government , in connectio n with a sharp tur n of Austria n foreig n policy agains t Russia.

put up with foreign troops settling down even on the frontie r of his Empire , on Russia n territory ; for him the mock war soon became a war in earnest .
Now, what was his most favourabl e ground fo r a mock war, was, for a real war, the most dangerous .
The strengt h of Russia in defence , the immens e extent of her territory, thinl y populated , impassable , poor in resources , recoile d upon Russi a as soon as Nicola s concentrate d all forces on Sebastopol, upo n one single point of the periphery .
The South Russian Steppe s that should have been the grave of the invaders , became th e grave of the Russia n armies , which Nicolas , with his own brutall y stupid imperiousness , drove one after the other, the last in the midst of winter , to the Crimea .
And when the last, hastily collected , poorly equipped , wretchedl y provide d army had lost som e two-third s of its men on the march—whol e battalion s perished i n snow-storms—an d the survivor s were too weak even for a serious attack on the enemy , then the inflated , empty-heade d Nicolas collapse d miserably , and escape d the consequence s of his Caesarian madnes s by taking poison.
64 The term s of peace which his successor 3 now hastene d to sign, were anythin g but harsh, Far more incisive , however , were the consequences o f the war within Russia .
To rule absolutel y at home, th e Tsar must be more than unconquerabl e abroad ; he must be uninterruptedl y victorious , must be in a position to reward unconditiona l obedienc e by the intoxicatio n of Chauvinis t triumph, b y conquest s followin g upon conquests .
And now Tsardom ha d miserabl y broke n down , and that too in its outwardly mos t imposin g representative 15; it had laid bare the weakness o f Russia to the world, and thus its own weaknes s to Russia.
A n immens e soberin g down followed .
The Russia n people had bee n too deeply stirred by the colossa l sacrifice s of the war, their devotio n had been appeale d to far too unsparingl y by the Tsar, for them to return there and then to the old passive state of unthinking obedience .
For graduall y Russia , too, had develope d economically an d intellectually ; alongsid e of the nobilit y there were no w springin g up the element s of a second educate d class, the Bourgeoisie .
In short, the new Tsar had to play the Liberal , but this time at home.
This meant the beginnin g of an interna l history o f Russia , of an intellectua l movemen t within the nation itself, and of the reflex of this movement : a public opinion , feeble at first, but perceptibl e more and more, and to be despise d less a Alexande r II.

And herewit h arose the foe before whom Russia n diplomacy mus t ultimatel y succumb .
For this sort of diplomac y is possible onl y in a country where , and so long as, the people remain absolutel y passive , have no will other than that of the Government, n o missio n but to furnis h soldier s and taxes for carrying ou t the objects of the diplomats .
As soon as Russia has an internal development , and with that, interna l party struggles , the attainment o f a constitutiona l form unde r which these party struggles ma y be fought out without violent convulsions , is only a question o f time.
But then the traditiona l Russia n policy of conquest i s a thing of the past; the unchangin g identit y of the aims of Russia n diplomac y is lost in the struggl e of parties for power; th e absolut e comman d over the forces of the nation is gone—Russia wil l remain difficul t to attack, and relativel y as weak in attack , but will become , in all other respects , a Europea n country lik e the rest, and the peculia r strengt h of its diplomac y will be broken for ever.
"La Russie ne boude pas, elle se recueille,"a said Chancello r Gortchakoff afte r the war.
60 He himself did not know how truly he spoke.
He was speakin g only of diplomati c Russia.
But non-officia l Russia wa s also recoverin g herself.
And this recueillement was encouraged b y the governmen t itself.
The war had proved that Russia neede d railways , steam engines, 15 modern 0 industry , even on purel y militar y grounds .
And thus the governmen t set about breeding a Russian capitalis t class.
But such a class cannot exist without a proletariat , a class of wage-workers, d and in order to procure th e element s for this, the so-calle d emancipatio n of the peasants ha d to be taken in hand; his persona l freedo m the peasant pai d for by the transferenc e of the better part of his landed propert y to the nobility .
What of it was left to him was too much fo r dying, too little for living.
While the Russia n peasan t Obshtchina* wa s attacke d thus at the very root, the new development o f the bourgeoisi e was artificiall y forced e as in a hot-house, b y means of railway concessions , protectiv e duties, and other privileges ; and thus a complet e social revolutio n was initiated i n town and country , which would not allow the spirits * The self-governin g Commun e of the Russian peasants .

These wer e the real results of Russia' s recueillement.
Meanwhile diplomac y did not yet seem to see what an opponen t had arise n at home.
On the contrary , abroad it seemed to be gaining victor y on victory .
At the Paris Congress , in 1856, Orlow was the centre figure , and played the leadin g part b; instea d of making sacrifices , Russia won new successes ; the maritim e rights claimed b y England , and dispute d by Russia ever since the time of Catherine, wer e definitel y abrogated , and the foundation s laid of a Russo-French allianc e agains t Austria.
66 This allianc e came into effect in 1859, when Louis Napoleo n lent himself to the avengin g of Russi a upon Austria .
The consequence s of the Russo-Frenc h conventions, whic h Mazzin i expose d at the time, and accordin g to which, i n the event of Austria' s prolonge d resistance , a Russian Grand Duk e was to be brough t forward as candidat e to the throne of an independen t Hungary,—thes e consequence s Austria escape d by quickl y signin g a peace.
But since 1848 the people have been spoiling th e handicraf t of diplomacy .
Italy becam e independen t and united , against the will of the Tsar and of Louis Napoleon.
67 The wa r of 1859 had alarme d Prussi a also.
She had nearly doubled he r army, and had placed a man at the helm, who in one respect, a t least, was a match for Russian diplomatists—i n his utter indifference a s to what means he employed .
This man was Bismarck.
Durin g the Polish insurrectio n of 1863, he, with theatrical ostentation , sided with Russia agains t Austria , France , and England , and did everythin g to help her to victory.
68 This secured him , in 1864, the defectio n of the Tsar from his traditional polic y in the Schleswig-Holstein Question; thes e Duchies were , with the permissio n of the Tsar, torn from Denmark.
69 Then came the Prusso-Austria n war of 1866; and here again th e Tsar rejoice d over the renewe d chastisemen t of Austria , and the growin g powe r of Prussia—th e only faithfu l vassal , faithful eve n after the kicking s of 1849-50 .

But like Louis Napoleon i n 1866, Alexande r was taken in by the rapid successe s of the Germa n armie s in 1870.
Instead of a protracte d war, exhausting bot h combatant s to death , there came the swift repetition o f blow upon blow, which in five weeks overthre w the Bonapartist Empire , and led its armies captive into Germany .
At this time there was but one place in Europ e where the position wa s rightly , understood , and that was in the Genera l Council o f the Internationa l Workin g Men's Association .
On the 9th of September , 1870, it issued a manifest o which said: — "As in 1865 promise s were exchange d betwee n Louis Bonapart e and Bismarck , so in 1870 promise s have been exchange d betwee n Gortschakoff an d Bismarck.
70 As Louis Bonapart e flattere d himself tha t the war of 1866, resultin g in the commo n exhaustio n of Austri a and Prussia , would make him the suprem e arbiter of Germany, s o Alexande r flattere d himsel f that the war of 1870, resulting i n the commo n exhaustio n of German y and France , would mak e him the suprem e arbiter of the Wester n Continent .
As the Second Empir e though t the North Germa n Confederatio n incompatible wit h its existence , so autocrati c Russia must conside r herself endangere d by a German Empir e under Prussia n leader -ship.
Such is the law of the old politica l system.
Within its pale the gain of one State is the loss of the other.
The Tsar's paramoun t influence ove r Europ e roots in his traditiona l hold on Germany .
At a momen t when in Russia hersel f volcani c social agencie s threaten t o shake the very base of autocracy , could the Tsar afford to bear with such a loss of foreign prestige ? Alread y the Muscovit e journals repea t the languag e of the Bonapartis t journal s after the war of 1866.
Do the Teuton patriot s really believe that liberty and peace wil l be guarantee d to German y by forcing France into the arms of Russia? If the fortun e of arms, the arroganc e of success , and dynasti c intrigu e lead German y to a spoliatio n of Frenc h territory, ther e will then only remain two course s open to her.
Either sh e must at all risks becom e the avowed tool o f Russia n aggrandisement, or , after some short respite , make again ready for anothe r 'defensive ' war, not one of those new-fangle d 'localised' wars , but a war of races, a war with the combine d Slavonian an d Roma n races.

In the Germa n a free renderin g of the quotatio n is given, which reads: "The war of 1866, it said, had been fough t with the consen t of Louis 41 The new Germa n Empir e did Russi a the servic e to wrest Alsace-Lorraine fro m France, 71 and thereb y to throw Franc e into Russia's arms .
The diplomac y of the Tsar was now in the enviabl e position o f having both France and Germany , now deadly foes by virtue o f this dismemberment , dependen t upon Russia .
This advantageous positio n seeme d to favour a step furthe r toward s Constantinople; th e Turkis h War of 1877 was declared .
After long struggles th e Russia n troops , in 1878, got as far as the gates of the Turkish capital , when four Englis h men-o'-wa r appeare d in the Bosphorus, an d forced Russia , in sight of the towers of the Church o f St.
Sophia , to halt, and to submit her propose d Treaty of Peace of San Stefan o to a Europea n Congres s for revision.
72 And yet an immens e success had—apparently—bee n obtained .
Roumania, Servia , Montenegro , enlarge d and made independen t by Russia , and therefor e in her debt; the quadrilatera l betwee n the Danube an d the Balkan , the stronges t bulwar k of Turkey, 73 dismantled; th e last rampar t of Constantinople , the Balkan , torn from Turke y and disarmed ; Bulgari a and Easter n Roumelia , nominally Turkish , actually Russian , vassal states; the territor y lost in 1856 in Bessarabia , recovered ; new and importan t position s conquered i n Armenia ; Austria , by the occupatio n of Bosnia , made an accomplic e in the partitio n of Turkey , and, moreover , an eternal opponen t of all Servian efforts for unity and indepen -dence; finally , Turkey , by loss of territory , exhaustion , and an exorbitant wa r indemnity , reduce d to absolut e dependenc e upon Russia, t o a position in which, as Russia n diplomac y knows only too well, 3 she only holds, for the time being the Dardanelles-an d the Bosphoru s in trust for Russia.
And thus it seemed as if Russia had but herself to choose the momen t when to take possessio n of Napoleon; bu t the victorie s and growth of Prussia n power had been sufficien t to drive Franc e into a hostile positio n vis-à-vis Prussia.
Th e renewe d successe s of 1870 and the concomitan t further growth in Prussian-Germa n power were likewis e to compel th e Russia n Tsar to adopt a hostile positio n toward s Germany , althoug h he supported German y diplomaticall y durin g the war.
Russia' s predominanc e in Europe wa s conditiona l on its traditiona l power over German y which had now been broken.
A t a time when the revolutionar y movemen t was becomin g a menace in Russia itself, the Tsar could not take this loss of prestig e abroad .
And if German y was now to drive France into Russia' s arms by annexin g Alsace-Lorraine , it must either submi t to becomin g the overt tool of Russia n design s for conquest , or else, after a short pause, prepar e for a war agains t Russia and Franc e at the same time, a war, which might easily degenerat e into a race-wa r agains t its Slav and Roman allies.

Th e great militar y power s of the Continen t divide d themselves int o two huge camps , threatenin g each other: Russia and Franc e here; German y and Austri a there.
Around these two the smalle r states have to group themselves .
But this means that Russia b canno t take the last great step, canno t really take possession o f Constantinopl e withou t a universa l war, with fairly evenly balance d chances , whose final issue will probabl y depend , not upon the origina l belligeren t parties , but upon England .
For a war of Austri a and German y agains t Russia and France cuts off the whol e of the West from the Russia n supply of corn.
All the western countrie s exist only by means of corn importe d from abroad.
Thi s then could only be supplie d by sea, and the naval superiority o f Englan d would allow her to cut off this supply either fro m Franc e or from Germany , and thus starve out either one or the other, accordin g to the side which she might take.
* But to fight for Constantinopl e in a general war, in which Englan d would tur n the scales—tha t is exactly what Russian diplomac y has worked 15 0 years to avoid.
It would in itself mean a defeat.
The importanc e of checkmatin g England' s probabl e resistanc e to Russia's fina l installatio n on the Bosphoru s has not been over-looked b y the diplomatist s of St.
Petersburg .
After the Crimea n war, and especiall y after the Indian mutiny of 1857, 74 the conques t of Turkestan , attempte d alread y in 1840, 75 becam e urgent .
In * The maritim e rights, so long claime d by England , and at last abandone d by the Declaratio n of Paris, 1856, would not be missed by her in an ordinar y war with one or two Continenta l Powers .
The latter would, in this age of railroads , even if blockaded b y sea, always be supplied , by land, with any quantit y of import s by conterminous neutrals ; this was, indeed , the chief service rendere d to Russia , during th e Crimea n War, by Prussia .
But in a Europea n war, such as now threaten s us, the whole Continen t would be cut up into hostile groups ; neutralit y would become, i n the long run, impossible ; internationa l commerc e by land would be almost, i f not altogether , suspended .
Under such circumstance s Englan d might regret givin g up her maritim e rights.
But then, such a war would also display the full forc e and effect of England' s naval superiority , and it may be questione d whether anythin g more would be at all required .

The n began the weary advanc e upon Merv from the south-east corne r of the Caspian ; in 1881, Geok Tepé, the first important advance d post in the desert was taken, in 1884 Merv surrendered, an d now the Transcaspia n Railwa y bridge s over the gap in the Russia n line of communication s betwee n Mikhailows k on the Caspia n and Tchardju i on the Oxus.
The presen t Russia n position i n Turkesta n is as yet far from offerin g a safe and sufficient basi s for an attack upon India.
But it constitutes , at all events, a very significan t menace of future invasio n and a cause of constant agitatio n amongs t the natives .
While the Englis h raj in India ha d no possibl e rival, even the mutin y of 1857 and its deterrent suppressio n might be looked upon as events fortifying , in the long run, the dominio n of England .
But with a Europea n first-rate militar y power settlin g down in Turkestan , forcing or coaxing Persi a and Afghanista n into vassalage , and slowly but irresistibly advancin g toward s the Hindukus h and Suleima n ranges , things ar e very different .
The Englis h raj ceases to be an unalterable doo m impose d upon India; a second alternativ e opens up befor e the natives ; what force has made force may undo; and whenever Englan d now attempt s to cross Russia' s path on the Black Sea , Russia will try to find unpleasan t work for Englan d in India.
Bu t in spite of all this, England' s maritim e power is such that she still can hurt Russia far more than Russia can hurt her, in a genera l war such as now seems impending.
3 Moreover, th e allianc e with a republica n France , whose rulers are subjec t to constan t change , is by no means safe for Tsardom , and still less in accordanc e with its heart's desire.
Only a restored French monarch y could offer satisfactor y guarantee s as ally in a war so terrible as that which is now alone possible .
Hence, too, for the last five years Tsardo m has taken the Orlean s under its special protection; the y have had to intermarr y with it, by marryin g into the Danis h Royal Family—tha t Russia n advance d post on the Sound.

Altogether i t is since 1878 that we begin to really see how much the positio n of Russian diplomac y has change d for the worse since the peopl e are more and more permittin g themselve s to put in a word, an d that with success .
Even in the Balkan Peninsula , the territory wher e Russia appear s ex professo* a s the champio n of nationalities, nothin g seems to succee d now.
The Roumanians , as a reward fo r having made victor y possibl e to the Russian s at Plevna,78 hav e been compelle d to give up their portio n of Bessarabia, an d will hardly allow themselve s to be taken in by drafts on the future with respec t to Transsylvani a and the Banat.
The Bulgarian s are heartil y sick of the Tsar's metho d of liberation, thank s to the Tsar's agents sent into their country .
Only the Servians , and possibl y the Greeks—bot h outsid e the direct line of fire on Constantinople—ar e not yet recalcitrant .
The Austria n Slavs, whom the Tsar felt called upon to delive r from Germa n bondage, hav e since, in the Cisleitha n Province s of the Empire 79 at least, playe d the part of the ruling race.
The phrase of the emancipation o f oppresse d Christian 15 nation s by the almight y Tsar is played out, and can, at most, be applie d to Crete and Armenia only , and that will no longer draw in Europe , not even with sanctimoniou s Englis h Liberals ; for the sake of Crete and Armenia, no t even Tsar-worshippin g Mr.

Kennan of the infamous brutalit y with which the Tsar suppresse s every attemp t at oppositio n in his own dominions, 0 after the notoriet y given to the floggin g to death of Madam e Sihida and other Russia n "atrocities".
80 And her e we come to the very kerne l of the matter .
The internal developmen t of Russia since 1856, furthere d by the Government itself, has done its work.
The social revolutio n has made gian t strides ; Russia is daily becomin g more and more Occidentalised; moder n manufactures , steam, d railways , the trans-formation o f all payment s in kind into money payments , and with this the crumblin g of the old foundation s of society are developin g with eve r accelerate d speed .

evolving th e incompatibilit y of despoti c Tsardo m with the new society i n course of formation .
Oppositio n parties are forming — constitutional an d revolutionary—whic h the Governmen t can only master b y means of increase d brutality .
And Russia n diplomac y sees wit h horro r the day approaching , on which the Russia n people wil l deman d to be heard, and when the settlemen t of their own interna l affairs will leave them neithe r time nor wish to concern themselve s with such puerilitie s as the conques t of Constantinople, o f India, and of the supremac y of the world.
The Revolution tha t in 1848 halted on the Polish frontier , is now knocking a t the door of Russia and it now has, within, plenty of allies wh o only wait the right momen t to throw open that door to it.
It is true, that whoeve r reads Russia n newspapers , might suppose tha t all Russia enthusiasticall y applaud s the Tsar's policy of conquest ; in them there is nothin g but Jingoism , Panslavism , the deliveranc e of Christian s from the Turkish , of Slavs from the German an d Magyar , yoke.
But, firstly, every one knows in what chains th e Russia n press lies bound ; secondly , the Governmen t itself ha s for years fostere d this Jingois m and Panslavis m in all schools; an d thirdly , these newspaper s express—s o far as they express an y sort of independen t opinion , only the opinio n of the town population , i.
e.
of the newly-create d Bourgeoisie , naturall y interested i n new conquest s as extension s of the Russia n home market.
Bu t this town populatio n is a vanishin g minorit y throughout th e country .
As soon as a Nationa l Assembl y gives the immense majorit y of the Russia n people—th e rural population — an opportunit y of making itself heard, we shall see quite anothe r state of things.
The experience s of the Governmen t with regard to the Zemstvo s (Count y Councils) 3 and which forced it to take away again all power from the Zemstvos 81 prove that a Russian Nationa l Assembly, i n order to settle only the most pressin g interna l difficulties, woul d at once have to put a decided stop to all hankering afte r new conquests .
The Europea n situatio n to-day is governe d by three facts: (1) the annexatio n of Alsace-Lorrain e to Germany ; (2) the im-pending advanc e of Russia n Tsardo m upon Constantinople ; (3) the struggl e in all countries , ever growin g fiercer , betwee n the Proletariat an d the Bourgeoisie , the working-clas s and the a The words in bracket s are deleted in the German.

middle-class, a struggl e whose thermomete r is the everywher e advancing Socialis t movement .
The two first necessitat e the groupin g of Europe , to-day, into two larg e camps .
The Germa n annexatio n makes France the ally of Russi a agains t Germany ; the threatenin g of Constantinopl e by Tsardom make s Austri a and even Italy the allies of Germany .
Both camp s are preparin g for a decisive battle, for a war, such as the worl d has not yet seen, in which 10 to 15 million armed combatants wil l stand face to face.
Only two circumstance s have thus far prevente d the outbrea k of this fearful war: first, the incredibly rapi d improvement s in firearms , in consequenc e of which ever y newly-invente d arm is already supersede d by a new invention, befor e it can be introduce d into even one army ; and, secondly, th e absolut e impossibilit y of calculatin g the chances , the complete uncertaint y as to who will finally come out victor from this giganti c struggle .
All this danger of a general war will disappea r on the day when a change of things in Russia will allow the Russia n people to blot out, at a stroke, the traditiona l policy of conques t of its Tsars, and to turn its attentio n to its own interna l vital interests , now seriousl y menaced, instea d of dreamin g about universa l supremacy .
On that day the Germa n Empire 3 will lose all its allies against France, who m the dange r from Russi a has driven into its arms.
Neither Austri a nor Italy will then have even the smalles t interes t in pullin g the Germa n Emperor's b chestnut s out of the fire of a colossal Europea n war.
The Germa n Empir e will fall back to that isolated position , in which, as Moltke says, everyon e fears and no one love s it,c the unavoidabl e result of its policy.
Then, too, the mutual sympath y betwee n Russi a strivin g after freedo m and Republican France , will be as suitabl e to the state of both countries, a s it will be free of danger to Europ e generally ; and then Bismarck , or whoeve r succeed s him, will think thrice before he force s on a war with France , in which neithe r Russia agains t Austria, no r Austria against Russia covers his flank, in which both these countrie s would rejoice at any defeat he might suffer, and in which it is very doubtfu l whethe r he could , single-handed , overcome th e French .
Then all sympathie s would be on the side of a The Germa n has "Bismarck " instead of "the Germa n Empire".

" — Ed France, an d she would, at worst, be safe from furthe r spoliation .
Instead, therefore , of steerin g toward s a war, the Germa n Empir e would probabl y soon find its isolated conditio n so intolerabl e that it would seek a sincere reconciliatio n with France , and thus all the terrible dange r of war would be removed .
Europe could disarm , and German y would have gained most of all.
On the same day Austri a will lose her only historica l raison d'être, the only justificatio n for her existence , that of barrier agains t a Russian advanc e on Constantinople .
When the Bosphoru s is no longer threatene d by Russia , Europe will lose all interes t in the maintenance o f this motley hodge-podg e of many peoples .
Equally indifferent the n will be the whole of the so-calle d Easter n question, th e continuatio n of Turkis h supremac y in Slav, Greek, and Albania n regions , and the dispute about the possessio n of the entrance t o the Black Sea, which no one will then be able to monopolise agains t the rest of Europe .
Magyars , Roumanians , Servians, Bulgarians , Arnauts, a Greeks , Armenians, b and Turks , will then , at last, be in a position to settle their mutual difference s without th e interferenc e of foreign Powers , to establis h amon g themselves th e boundarie s of each nationa l territory , to order their internal affair s accordin g to their own necessitie s and.
wishes .
It will at once be seen that the great hindranc e to the autonom y and free groupin g of the nations and fragment s of nations betwee n the Carpathians an d the ^Egean Sea was no other than that same Tsardom whic h used the pretende d emancipatio n of these nation s as a cloak for its plans of world-supremacy .
France wil l be freed from the unnatural , compulsor y positio n into whic h her allianc e with the Tsar has forced her.
If the alliance wit h the Republi c is repugnan t to the Tsar, far more repugnant t o the revolutionar y French people is this league with the despot , the executione r of both Poland and Russia .
In a war by the side of the Tsar, France would be forbidden , in the event of a defeat, to make use of her great, her only effectiv e means of preservation, he r salvatio n in 1793: the Revolution , the calling out of all the strengt h of the people by terror, and the revolutionis t propaganda i n the countr y of the enemy ; in such an event the Tsar woul d at once join hands with the enemie s of France , for times hav e change d since 1848, and the Tsar, in the meantime , has learn t to know from persona l experienc e what the Terror is.

the contrary , at the momen t of greatest danger Tsardo m will keep sheathed the sword of France.
But if in Russia, in the place of the almighty Tsar , there is a Nationa l Assembly , then the friendshi p of newly-free d Russi a for the French Republi c will be self-understood and natural ; then it will further instead of impedin g the revolutionar y movemen t in France, then it will be a gain to the European Proletaria t fightin g for its emancipation .
So France, too, must gai n by the overthro w of the omnipotenc e of the Tsar.
Then wil l also disappea r the excuse for the mad armament s which are turning Europ e into one large camp, and which make war itsel f seem almos t a relief.
Even the German Reichsta g would then find itself obliged to refuse the ever-increasin g demand s for war supplies .
And with this, Wester n Europ e would be in a position to occupy itself, undisturbe d by foreign diversion s and interference , with its own immediat e historica l task, with the conflict betwee n Proletaria t and Bourgeoisie , and a the solution of the economi c problem s connected wit h it.
The overthro w of the Tsar's despoti c rule in Russia would also directly hel p on this process .
On the day when Tsardo m falls—this las t stronghol d of the whole Europea n Reaction—o n that day a quite differen t wind will blow across Europe .
For the gentlemen in Berlin and Vienna 0 know perfectl y well, in spite of all difference s with the Tsar about Constantinople , etc.
, that the time may come when they will throw into his maw Constantinople , the Bosphorus , the Dardanelles , anythin g he wants, if only he will protect the m agains t Revolution .
On the day, therefore , when this chief stronghol d itself, when Russia 0 passes into the hands of the Revolution, the last remnan t of confidenc e and security of the reactionary government s of Europe is gone; they will be thrown upon thei r own resources , and will soon learn how little they are worth then .
The German Emperor d might perhap s be tempted into sendin g an army to restore the authorit y of the Tsar—tha n which ther e could be no better way to destroy his own authority.

Th e last genera l electio n shows that the Germa n Socialists ar e doublin g their strengt h every three years; that to-day, o f all single parties in the empire , they are the strongest , counting 1,437,00 0 votes out of a total of seven millions ; and that all penal and coerciv e legislatio n was utterly powerles s to stop their advance.
82 Bu t the Germa n Socialists , while willing to accept , on account, an y economi c concession s the young Empero r may make to the workin g class, are determined , and after ten years' coercio n more determine d than ever, to recove r the politica l liberty conquered i n 1848 on the Berlin barricades , but lost again to a great exten t under Manteuffe l and Bismarck .
They know that this political libert y will alone give them the means of attainin g the economic emancipatio n of the workin g class.
In spite of any appearances t o the contrary , a struggle is imminen t betwee n the German Socialist s and the Emperor , the representativ e of persona l and paterna l government .
In this struggle , the Empero r must ultimately b e beaten .
The electora l return s prove that the Socialists ar e making headwa y rapidly even in the country districts , while the large towns already as good as belong to them; and, in a country wher e every able-bodie d adult male is a soldier, this means th e gradua l conversio n of the army to Socialism .
Now let a sudden chang e of system take place in Russia , and the effect upon Germany mus t be tremendous ; it must hasten the crisis and double th e chance s of the Socialists.

ON ANTI-SEMITIS M (FROM A PRIVAT E LETTE R TO VIENNA) 83 .
.
.
But whethe r you might not be doing more harm than good with you r anti-Semitis m is somethin g I would ask you to consider .
For anti-Semitis m betoken s a retarde d culture , which is why it is found onl y in Prussi a and Austria , and in Russia too.
Anyon e dabbling i n anti-Semitism , either in Englan d or in America , would simply b e ridiculed , while in Paris the only impressio n created by M.
Drumont' s writings—wittie r by far than those of the Germa n anti-Semites—was tha t of a somewha t ineffectua l flash in the pan.
Moreover, no w that he is standin g for the Municipa l Counci l he has actuall y had to declar e himsel f an opponen t of Christia n no less than of Jewish capital .
And M.
Drumon t would be read even were he to take the opposit e view.
In Prussi a it is the lesser nobility , the Junker s with an income of 10,000 mark s and outgoing s of 20,000 , and hence subjec t to usury, wh o indulg e in anti-Semitism , while both in Prussi a and Austria a vociferou s chorus is provide d by those whom competi -tion from big capital has ruined — the petty bourgeoisie , skilled craftsmen an d small shop-keepers .
But in as much as capital , whether Semiti c or Aryan, circumcise d or baptised , is destroyin g these classe s of society which are reactionar y throug h and through , it is only doing what pertain s to its office, and doing it well; it is helping t o impel the retarde d Prussian s and Austrian s forwar d until the y eventuall y attain the present-da y level at which all the old socia l distinction s resolv e themselve s in the one great antithesis—capitalists an d wage-labourers .
Only in places where this has not yet happened , where there is no strong capitalis t class and henc e no strong class of wage-labourers , where capital is not yet stron g enoug h to gain contro l of nationa l productio n as a whole, s o that its activitie s are mainly confine d to the Stock Exchange—in othe r words, where productio n is still in the hands of the farmers , landowners , craftsme n and suchlik e classe s surviving fro m the Middle Ages—there , and there alone, is capital mainly Jewish , and there alone is anti-Semitis m rife.
In North Americ a not a single Jew i s to be found among the millionaires whos e wealth can, in some cases, scarcely be expresse d in terms of our paltry marks, gulden or francs and, by compariso n with thes e Americans , the Rothschild s are veritabl e paupers .
And even in England , Rothschil d is a man of modest means when set, for example , against the Duke of Westminster.
" 1 Even in our own Rhineland fro m which , with the help of the French , we drove the aristocracy 9 5 years ago and where we have establishe d moder n industry, on e may look in vain for Jews.
Hence anti-Semitis m is merely the reactio n of declinin g medie -val socia l strata agains t a modern society consistin g essentiall y of capitalists an d wage-labourers , so that all it serves are reactionar y ends unde r a purportedl y socialis t cloak; it is a degenerat e form of feudal socialis m and we can have nothin g to do with that.
The very fact of its existenc e in a region is proof that there is not yet enough capita l there.
Capital and wage-labou r are today indivisi -ble.
The stronge r capita l and hence the wage-earnin g class becomes, th e closer will be the demise of capitalis t domination .
So what I would wish for us Germans , amongs t whom I also count the Viennese , is that the capitalis t econom y should develo p at a truly spankin g pace rather than slowly declin e into stagnation .
In addition , the anti-Semit e present s the facts in an entirel y false light.
H e doesn' t even know the Jews he decries , otherwis e he would b e aware that, thanks to anti-Semitis m in eastern Europe , and to the Spanis h Inquisitio n in Turkey , there are here in England an d in Americ a thousand s upon thousand s of Jewish proletarians; an d it is precisel y these Jewish worker s who are the worst exploite d and the most poverty-stricken .
In Englan d during the past twelve month s we have had three strike s by Jewish workers.
84 Ar e we then expecte d to engage in anti-Semitis m in our struggle agains t capital ? Furthermore, w e are far too deeply indebte d to the Jews.
Leaving asid e Heine and Börne, Mar x was a full-bloode d Jew; Lassalle wa s a Jew.

This was by my friend Samue l Moore, and we went throug h it togethe r once more before it was sent to press.
It is entitled : Manifesto of the Communist Party, by Karl Marx and Frederic k Engels.

b I have added some of the note s of that edition to the presen t one.
The Manifesto ha s had a history of its own.
Greete d with enthusiasm, a t the time of its appearance , by the then still not at all numerou s vanguar d of scientifi c Socialis m (as is proved by the translations mentione d in the first preface 0), it was soon forced into the backgroun d by the reactionar y development s that originated wit h the defeat of the Paris worker s in June 1848, and was finall y excommunicate d "accordin g to law" by the convictio n of the Cologn e Communist s in Novembe r 1852.
89 With the disappearance fro m the public scene of the workers ' movemen t that had begun with the Februar y revolution, 0 the Manifesto passed int o the background .
When th e workin g class of Europe had again gathere d sufficien t strength fo r a new onslaugh t upon the power of the ruling classes , the Internationa l Workin g Men's Associatio n came into being.
Its aim was to weld togethe r into one hug e army the whole militan t working clas s of Europ e and America .
Therefor e it could not set out from the principle s laid down in the Manifesto.
I t was bound to have a programm e which would not shut the door on the Englis h TRADE UNIONS , the French , Belgian , Italian and Spanis h Proudhon -ists and the Germa n Lassalleans.
* This programme—th e preambl e to the Rules of the International 6—was draw n up by Marx with a * Lassalle personally, t o us, always acknowledge d himsel f to be a "disciple " of Marx, and , as such, stood, of course , on the ground of the Manifesto.
Matter s were quite differen t with regard to those of his follower s who did not go beyond his demand fo r producers ' co-operative s supporte d by state credits and who divide d the whol e workin g class into supporter s of state assistanc e and supporter s of self-assistance.

master han d acknowledge d even by Bakuni n and the anarchists .
For the ultimat e triump h of the ideas set forth in the Manifesto Marx relie d solely and exlusivel y upon the intellectua l develop -ment of the workin g class, as it necessaril y had to ensue from united actio n and discussion .
The events and vicissitude s in the struggle agains t capital , the defeats even more than the successes , could no t but demonstrat e to the fighter s the inadequac y hithert o of their universa l panacea s and make their minds more receptiv e to a thoroug h understandin g of the true condition s for the emancipation o f the workers .
And Marx was right.
The workin g class of 1874, at the dissolutio n of the International , was altogether differen t from that of 1864, at its foundation .
Proudhonism i n the Latin countrie s and the specific Lassalleanis m in German y were dying out, and even the then arch-conservativ e English TRAD E UNION S were graduall y approachin g the point where in 1887 the chairma n of their Swanse a Congress 3 could say in their name : "Continenta l Socialis m [.
.
.
] has lost its terrors for us.
" b Yet by 1887 Continenta l Socialis m was almost exclusivel y the theory heralded i n the Manifesto.
Thus , to a certain extent, the history of the Manifesto reflect s the history of the modern working-clas s movemen t since 1848 .
At present it is doubtles s the most widely circulated , the most internationa l produc t of all socialis t literature , the commo n programme o f many million s of worker s of all countries , from Siberia t o California .
Nevertheless, whe n it appeare d we could not have called it a socialist manifesto .
In 1847 two kinds of people were considere d socialists.
O n the one hand were the adherent s of the variou s Utopian systems , notabl y the Owenite s in Englan d and the Fourierists i n France , both of whom at that date had alread y dwindled t o mere sects graduall y dying out.
On the other, the manifold type s of social quacks who wante d to eliminat e social abuses throug h their variou s universa l panacea s and all kinds of patchwork, withou t hurting capital and profit in the least.
In both cases, people who stood outsid e the labour movemen t and who looked fo r suppor t rather to the "educated " classes .
The section of the workin g class, however , which demande d a radical reconstruction o f society , convince d that mere politica l revolution s were no t enough , then called itself communist.
I t was still a rough-hewn, onl y instinctive , and frequentl y somewha t crude Communism.

systems o f Utopia n Communism—i n Franc e the "Icarian " Com-munism o f Cabet, and in German y that of Weitling.
Socialism i n 1847 signifie d a bourgeoi s movement , Communism , a working -class movement .
Socialis m was, on the Continen t at least, quite respectable, wherea s Communis m was the very opposite .
And since we were very decidedl y of the opinio n as early as then that "the emancipatio n of the worker s must be the act of the workin g class itself", 9 we could have no hesitatio n as to which of the two names w e should choose .
Nor has it ever occurre d to us since to repudiate it .
"Working me n of all countries , unite! " But few voices re-sponded whe n we proclaime d these words to the world forty-tw o years ago , on the eve of the first Paris revolutio n in which the proletariat cam e out with demand s of its own.
On Septembe r 28, 1864, however , the proletarian s of most of the Wester n Europea n countries joine d hand s in the Internationa l Workin g Men's Association o f gloriou s memory .
True, the Internationa l itself lived onl y nine years.
But that the eterna l union of the proletarians o f all countrie s created by it is still alive and lives stronger tha n ever, there is no better witnes s than this day.
Because today , as I write these lines, the Europea n and America n proletariat i s reviewin g its fightin g forces , mobilise d for the first time, mobilise d as one army , under one flag , for one immediat e aim: the standar d eight-hou r workin g day to be establishe d by legal enactment , as proclaime d by the Genev a Congres s of the International i n 1866, and again by the Paris Workers ' Congres s in 1889.
91 And today' s spectacl e will open the eyes of the capitalist s and landlord s of all countrie s to the fact that today the workin g men of all countrie s are united indeed .
If only Marx were still by my side to see this with his own eyes! London, Ma y 1, 1890 F.
Engels First publishe d in Das Kommunistische Printed accordin g to the book Manifest, London , 1890 61 MAY 4 IN LONDO N The Ma y Day celebratio n of the proletaria t was epoch-makin g not only by its universa l characte r which made it the first international action o f the militan t workin g class.
It also marke d most gratifyin g advance s in the various countrie s taken individual -ly.
Frien d and foe agree that on the whole Continent it was Austria, and in Austria Vienna, that celebrated the holiday of the proletariat in the most brilliant and dignified manner, an d that the Austrian , above all the Viennese , worker s thereb y won themselve s an entirel y different standin g in the movement .
Only a few years ago the Austrian movemen t had decline d almost to zero, and the worker s of the Germa n and Slav crown lands were split into hostil e contingents tha t wore themselve s out in internecin e strife.
Anyon e who had claime d ever just three years ago that on May 1, 1890 Vienna an d the whole of Austri a would set an exampl e to all others o f how a proletaria n class holiday should be celebrated , would hav e been laughe d out of court.
We shall do well not to forget thi s fact when judgin g those squabble s stemmin g from internal discor d in which the worker s of other countrie s continu e to wear themselve s out to this day, as, for instance , in France .
Who would clai m that Paris cannot do what Vienna has done? But on May 4 Vienna was cast in the shade by London .
And I consider i t to be the most importan t and magnificen t aspect of the entire Ma y Day celebratio n that on May 4, 1890, the English proletariat, rousin g itself from forty years of hibernation , rejoined the movement of its class.
This cannot be appreciate d withou t looking at the past history of May 4.
Towards th e beginnin g of last year the world's largest and most poverty-stricken working-clas s district , the East End of London , was stirre d graduall y into action .
On April 1, 1889, the GAS Frederick Engel s WORKERS' AN D GENERA L LABOURERS ' UNION was founded ; today it has some 100,00 0 members .
It was largely throug h the participatio n of this intereste d union (many are gas worker s in winter and dock workers i n summer ) that the big dockers ' strike started on its way and shoo k even the bottom-mos t section of the East Londo n workers ou t of their self-neglect.
93 Trade s union upon trades union wa s formed among these, mostly unskille d workers , while those alread y in existenc e there, having hithert o barely kept themselves going , now blossome d forth at speed.
But these new TRADES UNION S are very differen t from the old ones.
The latter, encompassing "skilled " workers , are exclusive ; they bar all workers wh o have not receive d a guild training , and thereb y themselves giv e rise to competitio n from those not in the guild; they are rich, but the richer they become , the more they degenerate int o mere health-insuranc e and death benefi t funds; they are conservativ e and they steer clear above all of .
.
.
socialism , as far and as long as they can.
The new "unskilled " unions , on the other hand , admit every worke r in the given trade; they are essentially, an d the gas worker s even exclusively , unions geared to organising an d fundin g strikes .
And while they are not socialist s to a man, they nevertheles s absolutel y insist on being led by socialist s and no others .
But socialis t propagand a had alread y been activel y pursued fo r years in the East End, where it was above all Mrs.
E.
Marx-Avelin g and her husband , Edward Aveling , who had four years earlie r discovere d the most fertile ground for propagand a in the "Radica l clubs" 94 consistin g almost exclusivel y of workers , had worked o n them steadil y and, as is now evident , to the best effect.
During th e dock workers ' strike Mrs.
Aveling was one of the three women wh o organise d the distributio n of relief, and as a token of gratitude Mr .
Hyndman , the runawa y of Trafalga r Square, 95 slanderously allege d that in return they had been paid three pounds sterlin g every week from the strike fund.
Mrs.
Aveling led last winter' s strike in Silvertow n almost unaided, 96 as also in the East End , and in the gas workers ' union she represent s a women' s branch founde d by herself.
Last autum n the gas worker s won an eight-hou r workin g day here in London , but in an unsuccessfu l strike lost it again in the southern par t of the city, 97 acquirin g sufficien t proof that this gain is by no means safe for all times in the norther n part either.
Is it surprising, then , that they readily accepte d Mrs.
Aveling' s propos -al to hold a May Day celebration , as decide d by the Paris Congress, i n suppor t of a legal eight-hou r day in London ? In concert wit h severa l socialis t groups , the Radica l clubs and the other TRADE S UNION S in the East End, they set up a Centra l Committee t o organis e a large demonstratio n for the purpos e in Hyde Park .
As it transpire d that all attempt s to hold the demonstration o n Thursday , May 1, were bound to fail this year, a decision wa s taken to postpon e it till Sunday , May 4.
To ensur e that, as far as possible , all Londo n worker s took part, the Centra l Committee , in its naïve impartiality, invite d the London TRADE S COUNCI L as well.
This is a body made up of delegate s from th e Londo n TRADE S UNIONS , mostly of the older "skilled " unions, an d one in which, as might be expected , the anti-socialis t elements stil l comman d a majority .
The TRADE S COUNCI L realised that the movemen t for an eight-hou r day was threatenin g to grow beyond it s control .
The old TRADE S UNION S also favour an eight-hou r working day , but not one to be establishe d by law.
What they mean by an eight-hou r day is that normal daily wages should be paid for eight hours—so-and-s o much per hour—bu t that any amount o f overtim e should be permitte d daily, provide d every hour of overtim e is paid at a higher rate—say , at the rate of one and a half or two ordinar y hours.
The point therefor e was to tie in the demonstratio n with this version of the workin g day, one to be won by "free" agreemen t but certainl y not to be made statutor y by an Act of Parliament .
To this end the TRADE S COUNCI L allied itself with the SOCIAL-DEMOCRATI C FEDERATIO N under the above-mentione d Mr.
Hyndman , an associatio n which poses as the One True Church o f Englis h Socialism , which, quite in keepin g with its nature, conclude d a life-and-deat h allianc e with the Frenc h Possibilists 98 and sent a delegatio n to their congress , and which therefore fro m the outset regarde d the May Day celebratio n the Marxist Congres s had decide d to hold as a sin agains t the Holy Ghost.
Th e movemen t was growin g beyon d the contro l of the Federation a s well; but to fall in line with the Centra l Committe e would mea n placin g itself under "Marxist " leadership ; on the other hand , if the TRADE S COUNCI L were to take the matter into its own hand s and if the celebratio n were held on May 4 instead of the 1st, it would no longer be anythin g like the wicked "Marxist " May Da y celebratio n and so it [the Federation ] could join in.
Notwithstanding th e inclusio n in its programm e of a legal eight-hour day , the Social Democrati c Federatio n eagerl y claspe d the hand proffere d by the TRADE S COUNCIL .
Now th e new allies , strang e bed-fellow s thoug h they were, played o n the Centra l Committe e a trick which would, it is true, be considered no t only permissibl e but quite clever by the politica l ways of the Englis h bourgeoisie , but one which Europea n and American worker s will probabl y find perfectl y ordinary .
The fact is that in the case of mass meeting s in Hyde Park the organiser s must firs t announc e their intentio n to the BOARD OF WORKS and reach agreement wit h it on details , namely secure permissio n to move onto the grass the carts that are to serve as platforms .
Besides , regulations sa y that after a meeting has been announced , no other meeting ma y be held in the Park on the same day.
The Centra l Committee ha d not yet made the announcement ; but scarcely had the bodie s allied agains t it heard the news than they registere d a meeting i n the Park for May 4 and obtaine d permissio n for seven platforms, doin g so behind the backs of the Centra l Committee .
The TRADE S COUNCI L and the Federatio n considere d that they had thus rente d the Park for May 4 and had victory in the bag.
The former calle d a meeting of delegate s from the TRADE S UNIONS , to which it also invited two delegate s from the Centra l Committee ; the Centra l Committe e sent three, includin g Mrs.
Aveling .
The TRADES COUNCI L treated them as if it were runnin g the whole show.
It informe d them that only trade s unions , that is to say no socialis t associations o r politica l clubs, were to take part in the demonstra -tion and carry banners .
Just how the Social Democrati c Federatio n was to participat e in the demonstratio n remaine d a mystery .
The Council ha d alread y edited the resolutio n to be submitte d to the meeting, an d had deleted fro m it the deman d for a legal eight-hour day ; a proposa l that this be reinserte d was neithe r accepted fo r debate , nor was it voted on.
And lastly, the Counci l refused t o admit Mrs.
Aveling as a delegate , claimin g that she was not a manual worker (which is not true), and this despite the fact that its own President , Mr.
Shipton , had not lifted a finger in his own trad e for fully fifteen years.
The worker s on the Centra l Committe e were outrage d by the trick playe d on them.
It looked as if the demonstratio n had been finally pu t into the hands of two bodies representin g only small minorities amon g the Londo n workers .
There seeme d to be no remedy bu t to storm the platform s of the TRADES COUNCIL , as the gas workers ha d threatened.
—The n Edwar d Avelin g went to the Ministry and , contrar y to regulations , secured permissio n for the Central Committe e likewis e to bring seven platform s to the Park.
The attemp t to fix the demonstratio n in accordanc e with the interests o f the minorit y had failed; the TRADES COUNCI L pulled in its horns an d was glad to be able to negotiat e with the Centra l Committee o n an equal footin g over arrangement s for the demonstration.
One has to know this past history to appreciat e the nature and significance o f the demonstration .
Prompte d by the East End workers wh o had recentl y joined the movement , the demonstra -tion elicite d such a universa l respons e that two elements—whic h were no less hostile to each other than both of them togethe r were to the fundamenta l idea of the demonstration—ha d to pull together i n order to seize the leadershi p and use the meetin g to their ow n advantage .
On the one hand, the conservativ e TRADE S COUNCIL preachin g equal rights for capital and labour ; on the other, a Social Democrati c Federatio n posing as radical and talking of social revolutio n wheneve r it was safe to do so—an d the two joined togethe r to play a mean trick with an eye to capitalisin g on a demonstratio n mortall y hated by both.
These events meant that the May 4 meeting was split into two parts.
On the one side we find the conservativ e workers , whose horizon s do not extend beyond th e wage-labou r system , and next to them a feeble but power-hungry socialis t sect; on the other side, the great bulk of workers wh o had recentl y joined the movemen t and who want no more to do with the Manchesteris m of the old TRADE S UNIONS, " preferring t o win their complet e emancipatio n themselves , with allies of their own choice , and not with those impose d by a tiny socialist clique .
On one side we find stagnatio n represente d by TRADES UNION S that have not yet completel y freed themselve s from the craft spirit, and by a narrow-minde d sect backed by the most wretched o f allies; on the other, the living free movemen t of the re-awakening Englis h proletariat .
And it was apparen t even to the blindest wher e there was fresh life in that double gatherin g and where stagnation .
Surroundin g the seven platform s of the Centra l Committee wer e dense crowd s as far as the eye could see, marching u p with music and banners , over a hundred thousan d in the procession , reinforce d by almos t as many who had come individually; everywher e harmon y and enthusiasm , and yet order and organisation .
Aroun d the platform s of the combine d reac-tionaries, o n the other hand, everythin g seeme d dull; their procession wa s greatly inferio r to the other, poorly organised , ragged an d mostly late, so that in some parts things did not get under wa y there until the Centra l Committe e was already through .
While th e Libera l leaders of some Radica l clubs, and the official s of severa l TRADE S UNION S joined the TRADE S COUNCIL , the member s of the selfsam e associations—i n fact, four entire branche s of the Social Democrati c Federation—marche d togethe r with the Centra l Committee.
Fo r all that, the TRADE S COUNCI L succeede d in winnin g some attention , but the decisiv e succes s was achieve d by the Central Committee .
What th e numerou s onlookin g bourgeoi s politician s took home with the m as the overal l impressio n was the certaint y that the English proletariat , which for fully forty years had trailed behind the grea t Libera l Party and served it as electio n fodder , had awakened a t last to a new life and action of its own.
There can be no doub t that on May 4, 1890 the English workin g class joined the great internationa l army.
And that is a fact of epoch-makin g proportions.
Th e Englis h proletaria t rests on the most advance d industrial developmen t and, moreover , possesse s the greates t freedom o f politica l action.
Its long hibernation—th e result, on the one hand, of the failure of the Chartis t movemen t of 1836-5 0 and, on the other hand, of the colossa l rise of industr y betwee n 1848 and 1880—ha s finally come to an end.
The grandchildre n of the old Chartist s are steppin g into the front line.
For eight years the broa d masse s have been movin g into action , now here, now there.
Socialis t groups have emerged , but none has been able to transcend th e bound s of a sect; agitator s and would-b e party leaders, mer e speculator s and careerist s among them, they have remained officer s withou t an army.
It has almost invariabl y been like the famou s Rober t Blum colum n of the Baden campaig n of 1849 10°: one colonel , eleven officers , one bugler and one private .
And the bickerin g among those variou s Rober t Blum column s over the leadershi p of the future proletaria n army has been anything bu t edifying .
This will cease before long, just as it has ceased in German y and in Austria .
The tremendou s movemen t of the masse s will put an end to all these sects and little grouping s by absorbing th e men and showin g the officer s their proper places.
Those wh o don't like it may sneak away.
It won't come off withou t friction, bu t come off it will, and the English proletaria n army will, much soone r than some expect , be as united , as well organise d and as determine d as any, and will be jubilantl y hailed by all its comrades o n the Continen t and in America .

105 (Augus t 31, 1890) the retiring editor s of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung state tha t petty-bourgeois parliamentar y socialis m now had a majorit y in Ger-many.
Bu t majoritie s often very quickly becam e minorities , "and so the retirin g editor s of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung join Friedrich Engels in hoping that , as the naive state socialis m of Lassalle wa s overcome i n the past, the success-hungr y parliamentar y tendenc y amon g the present-da y Social Democrats wil l also soon be overcom e by the commo n sense of the Germa n working class".
3 Had I been able to entertai n the slightes t doubt about the nature o f the latest studen t revolt in our Germa n party, then my eyes woul d have been opene d by this height of impertinenc e displayed b y the ex-editor s of one of its main organs .
The ex-editors "join " me in hoping—therefor e I join them in hoping—that th e tendenc y represente d by people such as Auer, Bebel, Liebknecht, Singer shoul d soon have the minority , and that the "principle d attitude " represente d by the ex-editor s the majority o f the Germa n worker s behind it.
This means that the hopes of the ex-editor s have been directl y and falsely attributed t o me and I shall see that they are made to answe r for this personally.
I have felt no urge to involv e myself in the brawl initiate d by these studen t gents and men of letters.
However , I have expresse d my opinio n frankl y to all who wished to hear it.
And if the brawling gent s want to hear it publicly , so be it.
When thes e gents began to kick up a row agains t the party executive an d the parliamentar y group, I asked myself in surprise : 3 "An unsere Leser!" , Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung, No.
105 , August 31, 1890.
— Ed what are they after? What is all this aimed at? As far as I could see, there was no reason at all for the whole enormou s palaver .
On the dispute d questio n of May Day the party executiv e had perhaps hesitate d too long with its declaration .
However , it consisted o f five persons , living in four widely separate d places , and needin g time to reach an understanding .
But when it spoke, it said the right thing, the only fitting thing in the situation .
Events in Hambur g have proved it more than right.
102 In the debate some member s of the parliamentar y group and the part y executiv e have certainl y been clumsy .
Things like this occur alway s and everywhere , and reflect upon the individual , not the whol e group .
In its draft rules the parliamentar y group has been responsibl e for some few offence s agains t the democrati c code of conduct.
103 But this is only a draft, and it is up to the Party Congres s to adopt it, reject it, or amend it.
The Londo n Conference o f the Internationa l in 1871 also committe d such sins of form, and the Bakuninist s immediatel y took them up, making them the formal lever for their attacks on the Genera l Council.
104 For all that, everybod y knows today that the real democrac y rested in the Genera l Council , and not in the Bakuninis t Council, 105 which ha d engineere d a whole secret conspiratoria l apparatu s in order to put the Internationa l at its service .
When, a t the time of the Steame r Subsidy , the then parliamen -tary grou p did not for a momen t know what it wanted, and sought to make the editors of the Sozialdemokrat the scapegoa t for their own perplexity , I took a thoroughl y decisiv e stand on the side of the editor s and agains t the parliamentar y group.
106 I would do the same agai n today were the parliamentar y group or the party executive reall y to do things which seriousl y endangere d the party.

[REPLY T O THE EDITOR S OF THE SÄCHSISCHE ARBEITER-ZEITUNG] v TO THE EDITOR S OF THE SOZIALDEMOKRAT The signator y request s the publicatio n of the followin g letter, which wa s dispatche d yesterda y to the presen t editors of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung i n Dresden.
* * * In their farewel l messag e (No.
105 of Augus t 31, 1890) the retiring editor s of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung state tha t petty-bourgeois parliamentar y socialis m had a majority in Germany .
But majorities ofte n very quickly becam e minorities , ".
.
.
and s o the retirin g editor s of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung join Friedrich Engels in hoping that , as the naive state socialis m of Lassalle wa s overcome i n the past, the success-hungr y parliamentar y tendenc y among the present-da y Social Democrats wil l also soon be overcom e by the commo n sense of the Germa n working class".
3 The retirin g editor s greatly surpris e me in the above .
And perhaps themselve s too.
.
.
.
To date I know nothin g of a majorit y for petty-bourgeoi s parliamentar y socialis m in the Germa n party.
So they may "hope " whateve r they like and as long as they will, but I do not "join" them in hoping .
Had I been able to entertai n any doubt about the nature of the latest revol t by men of letters and student s in our Germa n party, then it would vanish faced with the height of impertinenc e of this attempt t o announc e my solidarit y with the somersault s of these gentlemen.

7-1550 My only connectio n with the retirin g editor s was that for the past few week s they had been sendin g me, unsolicited , their paper; I did not find it necessary , however , to tell them what I thought o f it.
Now I really have to tell them, and in public at that.
Theoretically I found in it—an d this is true by and large for the rest of the "opposition " press— a frenziedl y distorte d "Marxism" , marked o n the one hand by a considerabl e misunderstandin g of the viewpoin t which it claimed to represent , and on the other by a gross ignoranc e of the decisiv e historica l facts on every occasion , and thirdl y by that knowledg e of their own immeasurabl e superiority whic h so advantageousl y distinguishe s Germa n scrib-blers.
Marx foresaw such disciple s when he had this to say at the end of the seventie s about the "Marxism " raging among certain Frenchmen: "tout ce que je sais, c'est que moi, je ne suis pas marxiste" — "I know only this, that I am not a 'Marxist'.
" 108 Practically, I found in the paper a ruthless disregar d of all the actual condition s of party struggle , a death-defyin g "surmountin g of obstacles " in the imagination , which may do all honour to the untamed youthfu l courag e of the writers , but which, if transferre d from the imaginatio n to reality , would be sufficien t to bury the strongest part y of million s under the well-earne d laughte r of the whole hostil e world.
That even a small sect cannot allow itself, unpunished, suc h a schoolbo y policy—i n this respec t the gentle-men hav e had curiou s experience s since then.
All the complaint s against the parliamentar y group or the party executive, whic h they have been storing up for months , boil down at most to simple trifles.
But if the gentleme n like to strain at a gnat, thi s can be no reason for the Germa n worke r to swallow camels i n appreciation.
3 So they have harveste d what they had sown.
Quite apart from all the question s of context , the whole campaig n was started with such childishness , such naive self-deceptio n about their own importance, abou t the state of affairs and views within the party, that the outcom e was a foregon e conclusion .
May the gentleme n take the lesson to heart.
Some of them have written things which justified al l manne r of hope.
Most of them could accomplis h something, wer e they less convince d of the perfectio n of the stage of developmen t they have reache d at this moment .
May they come to realise that their "academi c education"—i n any case requirin g a thorough, critica l self-assessment—doe s not provide them with an a An allusio n to the biblical expression : "Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat, and swallo w a camel" (Matthew , 23:24).

112, Sep-tember 17 , 1890 THE INTERNATIONA L WORKERS ' CONGRES S OF 1891 At the congres s of the Englis h TRADE S UNION S in Liverpoo l (September 1890 ) u0 the Nationa l Counci l of the Belgian workers ' party invite d the TRADES UNION S to the internationa l congres s which is to be held next year in Belgium .
The Belgian s were given a mandat e by the Possibilis t Congres s to conven e an internationa l congres s in Belgium .
The Marxist Congress (I employ this designatio n for brevity' s sake) only gave them the mandat e to convene a congres s in cooperation with the Swiss; the place of the congres s remaine d unspecified .
Short of a deliberat e misunderstanding , the Belgian s have therefore invite d the Englishme n to the Possibilis t Congress , the only one which they had a mandat e to convene on their own.
And the Englis h accepte d enthusiastically .
It will be impossibl e to make the young TRADE S UNION S of simple manual worker s see that their good faith has been abused ; that there wil l be two congresse s in 1891, a good one and a bad one, and that it is the bad one which they have promise d to attend.
This is not simply my persona l opinion ; it is also the opinion of people who worked harder than anyon e to get the TRADES UNION S to enter the internationa l movement .
The campaig n which the Sozialdemokrat waged agains t the English friend s of the Possibil -ists111 in 1889 could not be repeate d this time with the same success.
If there are two congresses , why did the others not invite us also, so that we could have made our choice? Now it's too late.
That is what these practica l men will say.
They have accepte d the Belgians' invitatio n and they will go to the congres s which is to be held in Belgium .
That is absolutel y certain ; unless the Belgian s and the Possibilist s repel them by committin g some unequalle d stupidities; bu t they will not commi t these stupidities .
This situatio n is the inevitabl e consequenc e of the mistake s committed b y the Marxis t Congress .
The most importan t questio n was left unresolved—tha t of the future congress .
Even worse, any solution wa s rendere d almost impossibl e in that the convenin g was entrusted t o two nationa l committees , Belgian and Swiss, withou t whose prio r agreemen t even the smalles t step could not be taken—the sures t way of ensurin g that nothin g would be done.
And again , just as after the conferenc e at The Hague, 112 the Belgians, instea d of staying within the limits of the mandat e given to them, acted purely in their own interests .
They wished to make sure tha t the congres s was held in Belgium , and they are convening it , withou t worryin g about their Swiss co-mandatees .
I have no wish to cast doubt on the sincerit y and good intention s of the Belgia n Nationa l Council ; but, in practice , by the course of action whic h it has chosen , it is managin g the affairs of the Possibilists a t our expense .
Instead of blamin g the others , let us recognise tha t we are but sufferin g the consequence s of our own failings.
(D o not let us blame them too much; the mandat e which we gave them virtuall y invited them not to take it literally.
) We have placed ourselve s in a sort of impasse , in a situation in which w e cannot move, wherea s our rivals are acting.
How can we escape fro m it? First of all, it is certain that new attempt s will be made from more tha n one quarte r to preven t the "scandal " of two rival working men' s congresses .
We would not be able to reject these attempts; o n the contrary , if there is a repetitio n of the "scandal " it is in our greates t interes t to ensure that the responsibilit y falls on the Possibilist s and their allies.
Anyon e who has the slightes t experience o f the internationa l movemen t knows that in the event of a split he who provoke s it, or appear s to provok e it, is always in the wron g in the eyes of the workers .
Therefore , in the event that there are two congresse s in 1891, let us act in such a way that it is not we who can be accuse d of being the cause.
If it is certain that these attempt s to effect a union will be made—should w e await them passively ? Then we would be running th e risk that at the last minute the Possibilist s and their allies might presen t us with an ultimatu m full of traps (such as we are familiar with)—trap s hidden beneat h soothin g verbiage , so that the general publi c should not see any harm in it, whilst we would not be able to accept ; this, then, is the fine situatio n facing us: either accept an d walk into the trap with eyes wide open, or refuse and carry th e blame, in the eyes of the workers , for having brough t about th e collaps e of the socialis t union by sheer, inexplicabl e obstinacy! In a word, the situatio n is quite intolerable .
We must escape from it.
How? By acting.
Let us no longer sit back and rely on the mandate give n to the Belgian s and the Swiss—le t us take the matter int o our own hands.
3 Would th e union of the two congresse s be a regrettabl e thing as far as we are concerned ? Let us examin e the question .
We may count, for certain , on 1) the French Collectivist s 113 and Blanquists (th e latter reduce d by the large number s that deserte d to the Boulangis t camp 114), 2) the Germans , 3) the Austrians , 4) the Spanis h socialists , 5) the "revolutionary " Danes, 115 V5 of the Danish socialists , 6) the Swede s and perhap s some Norwegians , 7) the Swiss, 8) the banishe d Russian s and Poles.
The riva l congres s would compris e 1) the French Possibilists , 2) the English TRADE S UNIONS , which would be represente d en masse, and the Englis h SOCIA L DEMOCRATI C FEDERATION , which has profite d from the genera l upswin g of the movemen t in England , 3) the Belgians, 4 ) the Dutch, 5) the Spanis h trade unions from Barcelo -na, etc.
, 6) probabl y the Portugues e trade unions , 7) the Italians , 8) the "reformist " Danes , 4/5 of the socialis t mass in Denmark , who migh t attract a few Norwegians , too.
According t o circumstance s the Belgian s and the Dutch would come alon g to be represente d at our congres s also; on the other hand, th e Swiss would be capable of sendin g some delegate s to the Possibilist congress .
It follow s that this time the Possibilist s would have a much more respectabl e army than in 1889.
If we have the Germans , they will balanc e them with the English , lost to us by our inactio n and clumsiness; a s for the others , they have as many nationalitie s as we, if not more.
And with their skill in inventin g mandate s and fictitious representative s they would leave us a long way behind .
Let us add that if we carry on with the system of inactio n implemented hitherto , the blame for the split would certainl y fall on us, which would cause a further reductio n in the strengt h of our congress.
Let us now suppos e that the merge r has taken place.
Then our strength wil l be swolle n by all those who up to the presen t have been neutra l becaus e of the "scandal " of the split: the Belgians , a The followin g six paragraph s up to the words "Wha t are for us the indispensable conditions " are crossed by a vertical line in the manuscript.
— Ed.
the Dutch , the Italians ; they will inevitabl y attract the new Englis h TRADES UNIONS , formed out of excellen t elements , still pliable but well intentione d and intelligent .
We have already taken root there; the contac t of the French Collectivist s and the German s would be enough t o bring them still closer to us, all the more so as the S.
D.
F.
, whom wit h its overbearin g airs they find repugnant , is the pledged all y of the Possibilists .
The Belgian s only want congresse s where the y can take the lead and which the Possibilist s have procured fo r them, particularl y a big congres s at Brussels .
If we help the m to bring about a merger in their country, th e Flemish , who are the better elemen t in their ranks, will side with us and will balance th e Possibilis t tendencie s of the Bruxellois.
The Dutc h are fanatically kee n on a merger , but they are far from being Possibilists.
What ar e for us the indispensabl e conditions ? 1) That the joint congres s should be convene d by the two countries mandate d by the two congresse s of 1889.
The Belgian s will conven e in the name of the Possibilis t mandate , and the Belgians an d the Swiss jointly in the name of our mandate , form to be determined .
2) That the congres s should be its own master .
The rules and regulations, agenda s and resolution s of the precedin g congresse s do not exist for it.
It makes its own rules, the method of checkin g the mandates , and its agend a withou t being bound by any precedent.
N o committee , whethe r appointe d by one of the preceding congresses , or durin g the cours e of the merge r negotiations, ha s the right to bind the congres s in all matters .
3) The terms on which the variou s workin g men's association s are to be represented , and their proportions , will be laid down beforehand (definit e proposal s are desirable , it is not up to me to lay them down) .
4) A committe e whose compositio n remain s to be decide d will be instructe d to draft plans for the rules, the checkin g of mandates, an d an agenda , on which points the congres s will make the final decision .

t*U****+*in*i « **td*nrf*r ÎSW [FAREWELL LETTER TO THE READERS OF THE SOZIALDEMOKRAT] 116 Might I too be permitte d to bid farewel l to the reader .
The Sozialdemokrat must vanis h from the scene.
Not only because thi s has been so often announce d to the other parties .
Far more becaus e the Sozialdemokrat would itsel f under the change d circumstances necessaril y becom e somethin g else, with a differen t mission, differen t contributors , a differen t readership .
And a paper whic h played such a specific historica l role, a paper which was peculia r for the fact that in its columns , and in its column s only, the twelve most decisiv e years in the life of the Germa n workers' part y are reflected—suc h a paper cannot and must not change.
I t must remain what it was, or it must cease to exist.
On this we all agree.
We also all agree that the paper canno t disappea r withou t leaving a gap.
No organ appearin g in Germany , official or not, can replac e it.
For the party this is only a relative drawback : it is entering int o differen t condition s of struggl e and therefor e needs different weapon s and a differen t strateg y and tactics.
But it is an absolute los s for the contributors , and particularl y for me.
Twice in my life I have had the honou r and the pleasur e of working fo r a periodica l where I enjoyed to full measur e the two most favourabl e condition s in which one can be effectiv e in the press: firstly, unconditiona l press freedom , and secondly , the certainty tha t one was reachin g exactly that public one wished to reach.
The firs t occasio n was in 1848-184 9 at the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.
117 Those were revolutionar y times, and in such times it is anyway a pleasur e to work for the daily press.
You see the effect of every word before your eyes, you see how the articles literally hit the target, as though they were shells, and how they explode .
The secon d occasio n was at the Sozialdemokrat.
This too was a revolutionary interval , after the party found its feet again at the Wyden Congress , and from then on resume d the fight "with all methods", lega l or not.
118 The Sozialdemokrat wa s the embodimen t of this illegality .
For it there was no bindin g imperia l constitution , no imperia l crimina l code, no Prussia n commo n law.
Illegally , defying an d disdainin g all imperia l and provincia l legislation , it penetrated ever y week the frontier s of the Holy Germa n Empire ; detectives, spies , agents provocateurs , custom s officials , double d and treble d frontie r forces were powerless : almost with the certainty o f a bill of exchang e it was presente d to the subscribe r on the date of maturity ; no Stephan could preven t the Germa n Reichspost from havin g to dispatc h and delive r it.
And this with over ten thousan d subscriber s in Germany ; the banned writing s of the perio d befor e 1848 were very rarely paid for by their bourgeois purchasers , but for twelve years the worker s paid with the greates t punctualit y for their Sozialdemokrat.
How ofte n did my heart, th e heart of an old revolutionary , rejoice to observ e this excellently lubricate d noiseles s interpla y betwee n editors , dis-tributors an d subscribers , this BUSINESSLIK E organise d revolutionar y work proceedin g week after week, year in, year out with the same certainty! And the paper was worth the trouble s and danger s which its distribution cost .
It was certainl y the best paper the party ever possessed.
An d this was not simply becaus e it, alone amongs t them, enjoye d full freedo m of the press.
The principle s of the party wer e expounde d and recorde d with unusua l clarity and firmness, an d the tactical line of the editors was almost always the correct one .
And then there was somethin g else.
While our bourgeois pres s cultivate d the most deathly boredom , the Sozial­ demokrat generously reflecte d the cheerfu l humou r with which our workers ar e wont to fight police harassment .
And the Sozialdemokrat wa s anything bu t a mere mouthpiec e for the parliamentar y group .
When in 1885 the majorit y of the group favoured th e Steame r Subsidy , the paper firmly supporte d the opposite opinio n and held on to its right to do so, even when the majority forbad e it this right in an order of the day which they themselves mus t today find incomprehensible .
The fight lasted for just four weeks, during which the editors were warmly supporte d by the party comrade s inside and outsid e Germany .
On April 2 the ban was issued; on the 23rd the Sozialdemokrat published a declaration agree d betwee n the parliamentar y group and the editors, indicatin g that the group had rescinde d its ban.
119 At a later date it fell to the Sozialdemokrat to put to the test the renowned Swis s right of asylum.
120 There it became clear, as in all similar case s since 1830, that this right of asylum always collapse s precisely whe n it really ought to come into force.
But this is nothing new .
Since the little republic' s démocratisation from 183 0 on,121 the neighbourin g great powers have allowed it the democra -tic experimen t domesticall y only on the conditio n that the right of asylum fo r refugee s is exercise d under the supervisio n of the interested grea t power.
Switzerlan d is too weak not to submit .
It cannot b e blame d for this.
Marx used to say, specificall y with reference t o Holland , Switzerlan d and Denmark , that today the worst situate d was a small country which had had a great history .
But in "free Switzerland " they should stop braggin g about their immaculate righ t of asylum .
The Sozialdemokrat wa s the banne r of the Germa n party; after twelve year s of struggl e the party is victorious .
The Anti-Socialis t Law has fallen, Bismarc k has been overthrown .
The powerfu l German Empir e set in motio n agains t us all its instrument s of power; th e party scoffed at them, until finally the Germa n Empir e had to lower its flag before ours.
The Imperia l Governmen t will try out commo n law agains t us for the while, and so we shall, for the while , try out those legal means which we have regaine d for ourselves b y the vigorou s use of illegal means .
Whethe r the "legal" mean s are once again written into our programm e or not is pretty immaterial .
The attemp t must be made to get along with legal method s of struggl e for the time being.
Not only we are doing this , it is being done by all workers ' parties in all countrie s where th e worker s have a certain measur e of legal freedo m of action, an d this for the simple reason that it is the most productiv e method fo r them.
However , the prerequisit e for this is that the other sid e also acts legally .
If the attemp t is made once again actually t o place our party outside the commo n law, be it by means of new emergenc y legislation , unlawfu l conviction s and practice s by the Imperia l Suprem e Court, by police tyranny , or by other illegal encroachment s by the executive , then the Germa n Social Democrats wil l once again be driven to the illegal path as the only one ope n to them.
Even for the English , the most law-abidin g nation, th e first conditio n of legality on the part of the people is that all other agents of power remain within the bound s of the law; shoul d this not be the case, then in the English view of law, rebellion i s the first civic duty.
If this shoul d happen , what then? Will the party build barricades, appea l to the power of the gun? It will certainl y not do its opponent s this favour .
It will be saved from this by the knowledge o f its own positio n of strength , given it by every general electio n to the Reichstag .
Twenty per cent of the votes cast122 is a very respectabl e figure , but this also means that the opponents togethe r still have eighty per cent of the vote.
And with our part y seeing in this connectio n that its vote has double d in the past thre e years, and that it can expect an even greate r increas e by the time of the next elections , then it would be mad to attemp t a putsch 123 today with twenty agains t eighty and the army on top of that; the certain result would be—th e loss of all the position s of power wo n in the past twenty-fiv e years.
The part y has a much better and well-teste d means at its disposal.
O n the day our rights under commo n law are disputed , the Sozialdemokrat wil l reappear.
Th e old machinery , held in reserve fo r this case, will start up again, improved , enlarged , newly oiled.
An d one thing is certain : on a second run the Germa n Empire wil l not hold out for twelve years.

39, Septembe r 27, 1890 80 REPLY T O MR.
PAUL ERNS T A friend sends me the Magdebur g Volksstimme of Septembe r 16.
In an article therein , signed Paul Ernst, I find the followin g passage: "And if Engels now describe s our oppositio n as 'studen t revolt', I would ask him to demonstrat e where we have champione d other views but his own and Marx's ; and if I have depicte d our parliamentar y Social Democrat s as partly very petty-bourgeois i n character , Engels need onl y look at what he himsel f wrote in 1887 in the Prefac e to his Housing Question.
" a My dealin g with Germa n writer s over the years have enriche d me with many curiou s experiences .
But it seems that there are even greate r treats in store.
I am suppose d to tell Mr.
Paul Ernst where "we " have champione d other views, etc.
Well, as far as the "we" is concerned , that is, the "opposition " which entere d on to the scen e with such high and might y airs and made such a faint-hearted exit , and which I describe d as revolts by men of letters an d students, 124 we can keep it short: in just about every article whic h they publish .
But as far as Mr.
Ernst himself is concerned , I need not tell him that again .
For I have already told him so—fou r month s ago, in fact—and I suppose I must now plagu e the public, for better or for worse , with my "Ernst" b correspondence .
On May 31 this year Mr.
Ernst wrote to me from Görbersdorf that Mr.
Herman n Bahr wa s reproaching hi m in the Freie Bühne for wrongl y applyin g the Marxis t method of viewing history with a See F.

regard t o the Scandinavia n women' s movement / and would I please "say in a few lines whethe r my view correspond s with Marx' s or not, and furthermore permi t me to use the letter against Bahr".
I replied to him on June 5 that I could not become involve d in his disput e with Mr.
Bahr , and that I was quite unfamilia r with the "Scandinavian women' s movement".
0 I then went on: "As regard s your attemp t to handle the matter in a materialis t way, I should say first of all that the materialis t method turns into its opposit e if, in an historica l study, it is used not as a guide but rather a s a ready-mad e patter n in accordanc e with which one tailors th e historica l facts.
And if Mr.
Bah r believes h e has caught you out in this respect , it seems to me that he may not be altogether unjustified .
"You subsum e the whole of Norwa y and everythin g that happens ther e under one category , philistinism , and then un-hesitatingly an d erroneousl y apply to that Norwegia n philistinis m your opinio n of German philistinism .
But here there are two facts which presen t an insuperabl e obstacle .
"Firstly: When , throughou t Europe , the victory over Napoleo n turned ou t into the victory of reactio n over the Revolution , the fear inspire d by the latter sufficin g only in its cradle, France , to wrest a bourgeois-libera l constitution 125 from the returnin g legitimists, Norwa y took occasio n to give itself a constitutio n that was far more democratic 126 than any of its coevals in Europe .
"And, secondly , Norwa y has, during the past twenty years, experienced a literary reviva l unparallele d in any other countr y during tha t period save Russia .
Philistin e or not, this people has been far more creativ e than all the rest and is, indeed, putting its stamp o n other literatures , not least the German .
"These facts , in my view, render it necessar y to examin e Norwegian 'philistinism ' in the light of its particula r characteristics .
"And in so doing you will probabl y find that a very importan t distinction emerges .
In German y philistinis m was born of a failed revolution, a developmen t that was interrupte d and repressed .

Engels' letter to P.
Ernst of June 5, 1890 (presen t edition , Vol.
50).
— Ed, resulted fro m the Thirty Years ' War and the period that ensued—the ver y time in which practicall y all the great nation s were experiencin g a rapid rise.
That characte r persisted , even after German y had again been grippe d by the historica l move-ment, and was strong enoug h to imprint itself, more or less a generalised Germa n type, on all the other social classes in Germany unti l such time as our working class broke out of these narrow confines .
If the German worker s are flagrantl y 'unpatrio -tic',127 it is precisel y becaus e they have completel y shake n off German philistin e bigotry .
"Hence Germa n philistinis m is not a normal historica l phase but a caricatur e taken to extremes , a form of degeneration , just as your Polis h Jew is a caricatur e of the Jews.
The English , French , etc.
, lower middle class is not at all on the same level as your German lowe r middle class.
"In Norway , on the other hand, the class of small peasant s and the lowe r middle class with a slight admixtur e of middle class elements—as it existed , say, in Englan d and France in the seventeenth century—have , for several centuries , constitute d the normal stat e of society.
Here there is no question of an archaic state of affairs having been forcibl y impose d upon them by the failure of a great movemen t or by a Thirty Years' War.
The country has been retarde d by its isolatio n and by its natural circumstances, but its state was commensurat e with the condition s of its production , and hence normal .
It is only quite recentl y that large-scale industr y has, sporadicall y and on a very small scale, begun to come into the country , where, however , there is no place for the most powerfu l lever for the concentratio n of capital—th e stock exchange ; and even the tremendou s expansio n of maritim e trade has proved to be a conservativ e factor .
For wherea s everywhere els e steam is supersedin g sail, Norway is enormousl y increasing the number of its sailing vessels and possesses , if not the largest , then certainl y the second largest , fleet of windjammer s in the world, most of them owne d by small and medium-size d shipping firms , as in England in, say, 1720.
But nevertheles s this has brough t some animatio n into the old, sluggish existence — animation whic h finds expressio n in, among other things , the literary revival .
"The Norwegia n peasan t was never a serf, so that the whole process take s place against an entirely differen t background , as in Castile.
The lower middle class Norwegia n is the son of a free peasant and, such being the case, is a man compare d with the degenerate Germa n philistine .
And whateve r the failings of, for example, Ibsen' s plays, these reflect a world which is, it is true, lower middl e and middl e class, but utterly differen t from the German worl d — a world in which people still have characte r and initiative an d act independentl y if, by the standard s of other countries, ofte n eccentrically .
Personally , I would prefer to get to know al l I could about things of this sort before passin g judgment.
" So here I told Mr.
Ernst, albeit politely , but nonetheles s clearly and firmly , "where"—namely , in the article from the Freie Bühne which he sent to me himself.
When I demonstrat e to him that he uses the Marxis t approac h as nothin g but a pattern to which he tailors th e historica l facts that is precisel y an exampl e of the "considerable misunderstanding " of the same approac h with which I reproache d the gentlemen.
3 And when I prove to him, using his own exampl e of Norway , that his pattern of philistinis m on Germa n lines flies in the face of the historica l facts when applied t o Norway , I thereby catch him in advanc e and in person displaying th e 'gross ignoranc e of the decisiv e historica l facts on every occasion' , with which I also reproache d those gentlemen.
13 And now look at the affecte d primnes s which Mr.
Ernst feigns, like a country maide n treate d like "one of those" by some blueblooded scoundre l in the streets of Berlin! He appear s before me four month s after the above letter, the picture of outrage d virtue, demandin g that I should tell him "where?" .
Mr.
Ernst appears t o have but two literary frames of mind.
First he lets fly with impudenc e and self-assurance , as if there really was more to it than hot air; and when people procee d to defend themselves , [he protest s that] he has said nothin g at all and bemoan s the base disregard show n to his pure feelings .
Outrage d virtue in his letter to me in which he complain s that Mr.
Bah r has treate d him "with quite unbelievabl e insolence" ! Injure d innocenc e in his reply to me, in which he quite naively asks "where?" , while he must have known th e answe r for a good four months .
An unrecognise d noble sou l in the Magdebur g Volksstimme, i n which he also asks old Bremer, wh o had quite rightly rapped his knuckles , "Where? " And the sigh asks always : where? Always, where ? Does Mr .
Ernst still want to know "where" ? Well, let him turn, for example , to the article in the Volks-Tribüne on the "Danger s of a See this volume , pp.

Marxism",3 in which he appropriate s withou t hesitatio n the odd assertion o f the metaphysicis t Dühring —as if, accordin g to Marx, history make s itself quite automatically , withou t the cooperatio n of human being s (who after all are making it!), and as if these human beings wer e simply played like mere chessme n by the economi c conditions (whic h are the work of men themselves!) .
A man who is capable o f confusin g the distortio n of Marxis t theory by an opponent suc h as Dühring with thi s theory itself must turn elsewhere fo r help— I give up.
Perhaps I may now be excuse d from answerin g any more "wheres"? Mr .
Ernst is so prolific , he turns.
ou t articles with such alacrity tha t one comes across them everywhere .
And when you imagine tha t you have finally seen the last of them, he turns up again as the author of sundry anonymou s pieces.
Then a mere mortal lik e myself is unable to keep up and is tempte d to wish that instead o f prescribin g his remedie s so freely, Mr.
Ernst should have somethin g prescribe d for himself .
He says further : "If I have depicte d our parliamentar y Socia l Democrat s as partly very petty-bourgeois i n character , Engels need only" , etc.
Partly ver y petty-bourgeois ? In the article in the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung which force d me to reply,* 3 it says that petty-bourgeois parliamentar y socialis m has now a majority i n Germany .
And I said that I knew nothin g about this.
Now Mr.
Ernst merely wishes t o defend the assertio n that the parliamentar y group is "partly" ver y petty-bourgeois .
Again the unrecognise d noble soul, to whom the wicked world impute s all kinds of outrages .
Who has ever denie d that the petty-bourgeoi s tendenc y is represente d not only in the parliamentar y group but also in the party as a whole? Every part y has a right wing and a left wing, and that the right wing of the Social Democrati c Party is petty-bourgeoi s is only in the natur e of the things.
If there is no more to it than that, why all the fuss? We have been well aware of this old story for years, but it is a far cry from that to a petty-bourgeoi s majorit y in the parliamentary grou p or in the party itself.
If this danger were to pose a threat, we should not wait for the warning s of these strang e loyal Eckarts.
For the time being the vigorou s and joyfu l proletarian struggl e 128 agains t the Anti-Socialis t Law and the rapid economic developmen t have increasingl y deprive d this petty-a P.

85 bourgeois elemen t of ground , air and light, wherea s the pro-letarian elemen t has grown more and more powerful .
There is , however , one thing which I can divulg e to Mr.
Paul Ernst by way of conclusion : there is somethin g that is far more dangerous t o the party than a petty-bourgeoi s group which can be consigned t o the lumber-roo m at the next elections .
I am referrin g to a clique of loud-mouthe d men of letters and students , particularly whe n they are incapabl e of seeing the simples t things with thei r own eyes and of impartiall y weighin g up the relativ e importance o f the availabl e facts or the strengt h of the forces involved whe n assessin g an economi c or politica l situation , and hence see k to force on the party tactics that are utterly insane , as gentlemen suc h as Bruno Wille and Teistle r in particular , and to a lesser exten t Mr.
Ernst, have amply demonstrated .
And this clique becomes eve n more dangerou s if it unites to form a mutual assurance society , setting in motio n all the means of organise d advertising i n order to smuggl e its member s into the editoria l chairs of the party newspaper s and contro l the party by means of the party press.
Twelve years ago the Anti-Socialis t Law saved us from thi s danger , which was already overtakin g us, even then.
Now tha t this law is going, the danger is back again.
And I trust this will make it quite clear to Mr.
Paul Ernst exactly why I am willing t o fight tooth and nail to preven t myself from being identified wit h the element s of such a clique.

I realise only too well that by far the greater part of the honours shown me on this day by yourselve s and so many others, only falls to me as the survivin g representativ e of Marx, and beg your permission to be allowed to lay it on his grave as a wreath of honour.
However , what I can do to show myself belatedl y worthy of him I shall do; you may count on this.
Many thank s for your kind invitatio n to the Hungaria n Party Congress.
131 I shall sadly not be able to accept the invitatio n in person, but in spirit I shall be amongs t you on the 7th and 8th inst.
The existenc e of a Hungaria n Social-Democrati c Workers ' Party is a fresh proof that moder n large-scal e industr y canno t install itself in any country withou t revolutionisin g the old pre-capitalis t society, withou t creatin g not only a capitalis t class but also a proletariat and thus producin g the class struggl e betwee n the two and a workers ' party strivin g for the overthro w of the bourgeois -capitalist worl d order.
This workers ' party, which is now develop-ing ever more strongl y in Hungar y too, as I learn from the Arbeiter-Wochen-Chronik you were kind enoug h to send me, has from the start the advantag e of being international , of embracin g Magyars, Germans , Romanians , Serbs and Slovaks.
Please be kind enough t o convey my warmes t greeting s to this young party upon its Congress .

[PREFACE T O KARL MARX' S CRITIQUE OF THE GOTHA PROGRAMME] The manuscrip t publishe d here—th e coverin g letter to Bracke 3 as well as the critiqu e of the draft programme—wa s sent in 1875, shortly befor e the Gotha Unity Congress, 134 to Bracke for communication t o Geib, Auer, Bebel , and Liebknecht and subsequent retur n to Marx.
Since the Halle Party Congres s 135 has put the discussio n of the Gotha Programme o n the agenda of the party, I think I would be guilty of suppressio n if I any longer withheld fro m publicit y this important—perhap s the most impor-tant—document relevan t to this discussion .
But the manuscrip t has yet anothe r and more far-reachin g significance.
Her e for the first time Marx's attitud e to the line adopted b y Lassalle i n his agitatio n from the very beginnin g is clearly an d firmly set forth, both as regard s Lassalle' s economi c principles an d his tactics.
The ruthles s severit y with which the draft programm e is dissected here , the mercilessnes s with which the results obtaine d are enunciate d and the shortcoming s of the draft laid bare—al l this today , after fifteen years, can no longer give offense .

the Gotha Programme wa s given up even by its creator s as altogether inadequate .
Nevertheless, I have omitte d a few sharp persona l expression s and judgement s where these were immaterial , and replace d them by dots.
Marx himsel f would have done so if he had publishe d the manuscript today .
The violenc e of the languag e in some passage s was provoke d by two circumstances .
In the first place, Marx and I had been more intimatel y connecte d with the Germa n movemen t than wit h any other; we were, therefore , bound to be particularl y perturbed b y the decidedl y retrograd e step manifeste d by this draft programme .
And secondly , we were at that time, hardly two years afte r the Hague Congres s of the International, 136 engage d in the most violent struggl e agains t Bakuni n and his anarchists , who made us responsibl e for everythin g that happene d in the labour movement i n Germany ; hence we had to expect that we would also be saddle d with the secret paternit y of this programme .
These considerations hav e now cease d to exist and with them the necessity fo r the passage s in question .
For reason s of censorship , a few sentence s have been indicate d only by dots.
Where I have had to choose a milder expressio n this has been enclose d in square brackets .
Otherwis e the text has been reproduced wor d for word.

b Anonymous , reveale d by Mr.
Taylor as Mr.

The short repor t on the affair which I gave in my Preface (it is printed amongst th e attache d Documents , No.

And this took place in a pamphlet: Meine Polemik mit Karl Marx.

d This pamphle t gives us too much and too little.
Too much, because i t "also" gives us at length Mr.
Brentano' s views on "the advance o f the workin g class and its causes" .
These views have absolutely nothin g to do with the point at issue.
I remark only this: Mr.
Brentano' s constantl y repeate d declaratio n that labour protection legislatio n and trade associatio n organisation s are fitted to improv e the conditio n of the workin g class is by no means his own discovery .

and The Poverty of Philosophy t o Capital an d down to my most recent writings, 3 Marx and I have said this a hundre d times, though wit h very sharp reservations .
Firstly, the favourabl e effects of the resistin g trade association s are confine d to period s of average an d brisk business ; in period s of stagnatio n and crisis they regularly fail ; Mr.
Brentano' s claim that they "are capabl e of paralysing th e fateful effects of the reserv e army" is ridiculou s boasting.
An d secondly—ignorin g other less importan t reserva -tions—neither th e protectio n legislatio n nor the resistanc e of the trade association s remove s the main thing which needs abolishing : capitalist relations , which constantl y reproduc e the contradictio n between th e capitalis t class and the class of wage labourers .
The mass of wage labourer s remai n condemne d to life-lon g wage labour; th e gap betwee n them and the capitalist s become s ever deeper an d wider the more moder n large-scal e industr y takes over all branche s of production .
But since Mr.
Brentan o would gladl y convert wage-slave s into contented wage-slaves , he must hugely exaggerate th e advantageou s effects of labour protection , the resistance o f trade associations , social piecemea l legislation , etc.
; and as we are able to confron t these exaggeration s with the simple facts—hence hi s fury.
The pamphle t in questio n gives too little, since it gives, of the documents i n the polemic , only the items exchange d betwee n Mr.
Brentano and Marx , and not those which have appeare d since with regar d to this question .
So in order to place the reader in a position t o form an overal l judgement , I give, in the appendix : 1.

It goes withou t saying that I thereby omit all those passage s of Brentano' s argumen t which do not touc h upon the questio n of falsificatio n of quotation , but only constitute hi s "contributio n to the advance" , etc.

10 of the Berlin Concordia, Marc h 7, 1872, there was a fierce anonymou s attack upon Marx as the autho r of the Inaugural Addres s of the Genera l Counci l of the Internationa l in 1864.
a In this Address , it was stated , Marx had falsifie d a quotation fro m the budget speech made by Gladstone , at that time English Chancello r of the Exchequer , on April 16, 1863.
The passag e from the Inaugura l Addres s is printe d in the appendix, Documents , No.

c In the latter, the charge is formulate d as follows: "What i s the relationshi p betwee n this speech and the quotatio n by Marx? Gladstone firs t makes the point that there has undoubtedl y been a colossal increas e in the incom e of the country .
This is proved for him by the incom e tax.
But income ta x takes notice only of income s of 150 pound s sterling and over.
Person s with lowe r income s pay no incom e tax in England .
The fact that Gladston e mentions thi s so that his yardstic k can be properl y appreciate d is utilised by Marx to have Gladston e say: 'This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property.
' Yet this sentenc e is nowher e to be found in Gladstone' s speech.
I t says quite the opposite .
Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content!" This is the charge and, let it be noted, the only charge , that Anonymous, wh o has now admitte d he is called Lujo Brentano, makes agains t Marx.

"Organ o f the Germa n Manufacturers ' Association" .
Marx, who had neve r heard of this sheet, assume d the autho r to be a scribbling manufacturer , and dealt with him accordingly .
Marx demonstrate d in his reply in the Volksstaat (Documents, No.
4a) that the sentenc e had not only been quoted in the same way by Professo r Beesly in 1870 in The Fortnightly Review? bu t also before th e publicatio n of the Inaugura l Addres s in [H.
Roy,] The Theory of the Exchanges, London , 1864; and finally that the report in The Times o n April 17, 1863 also containe d the sentence , in form an d in content , as he had quoted it: "The augmentatio n I have described " (namel y as "this intoxicatin g augmenta -tion of wealth and power" ) "is an augmentatio n entirel y confine d to classes of property.
"0 If this passage , a passage which is certainl y compromisin g in the mouth o f an Englis h Chancello r of the Exchequer , is not to be found in Hansard, d this is simply becaus e Mr.
Gladston e was clever enoug h to get rid of it, in accordanc e with traditiona l English parliamentar y practice .
In any case, proof was given here that the sentenc e allegedl y lyingly adde d is to be found verbatim i n The Times o f April 17, 1863 in its report of the speech delivere d by Mr.
Gladston e the evening before .
And The Times wa s a Gladstonia n organ at that time.
And wha t is the reply now from Mr.
"Modesty " Brentano? (Concordia, Jul y 4, 1872, Documents , No.

e) With an impertinenc e he would never have dared under his own name , he repeat s the charge that Marx lyingly added the sentence: thi s charge , he adds, is "serious, an d combine d with the convincin g evidenc e provided , absolutel y devastating".
The evidenc e was nothin g but the passag e in Hansar d in which the sentenc e is missing .
It could thus at the most be "devastating " for this selfsam e ill-fate d sentence , which appeare d in The Times and not in Hansard .

And with the feeling tha t this evidenc e for the prosecutio n was pretty "convinc -ing", and that it would becom e "absolutel y devastating " in time, our anonymou s would-b e professo r now zealousl y attack s the quotation in Beesly and in The Theory of the Exchanges, cause s a big stir, claim s that Beesly quoted from the Inaugura l Addres s and Marx fro m The Theory of the Exchanges, etc.
All these are minor points.
Eve n if they are true, they prove nothin g on the question as to whether Gladston e spoke the sentence or Marx invente d it.
But by their very nature they could not be settled with absolut e finality, eithe r by Mr.
Brentan o at that time, or by me today.
On the othe r hand, they serve to divert attentio n from the main point, namely fro m the fatal Times report .
Before venturin g to deal with this, Anonymou s flexes his muscles by using variou s items of strong language , such as "frivolity borderin g upon the criminal" , "this lying quotation" , etc.
; and then he lays in with gusto as follows: "But her e we come, to be sure, to Marx's third line of defence , and this far exceeds, in its impudent mendacity, anythin g which came before .
Marx actuall y does not shrin k from citing The Times of April 17, 1863 as proof of the correctnes s of his quotation .
The Times of April 17, 1863, p.
7, page" (should be column) "5, line 17 et seq.
, reports, however, the speech as follows: And her e follows the Times report , which runs: "The augmentatio n I have described " (namel y as "this intoxicatin g augmenta -tion of wealth and power") "and the figures of which are founded , I think, upon accurate returns , is entirely confined to classes of property.
" And now we can only stare wide-eye d at the "impuden t mendacity" of Marx, who still dares to claim that the Times repor t contained the sentence : This intoxicatin g augmentation , etc.
, is entirely confine d to classes of property ! The Inaugura l Addres s states: "THIS INTOXICATIN G AUGMENTATIO N OF WEALTH AND POWER IS ENTIRELY CONFINED TO CLASSES OF PROPERTY.
" The Times states : "THE AUGMENTATIO N THERE DESCRIBED " (which not even Mr.
Brentano , anonymous or not, has so far argued is not the "AUGMENTATION " in the phrase "THIS INTOXICATIN G AUGMENTATIO N OF WEALTH AND POWER" ) "AND WHICH IS FOUNDED , I THINK , UPON ACCURAT E RETURNS , IS AN AUGMENTATION ENTIRELY CONFINED TO CLASSES OF PROPERTY.
" And now that Mr.
Brentan o has pointed out in The Times, wit h his own index finger , the sentenc e which Marx allegedl y lyingly added becaus e it was missing in Hansard , and has thus taken upon 9-1550 himself Marx' s alleged impuden t mendacity , he declare s trium-phantly tha t "both reports " (Times an d Hansard ) "fully coincid e materially .
The report in The Times jus t gives, formall y more contracted , what the shorthan d report by Hansard give s verbatim .
Yet despite the fact that the Times repor t contain s the direct opposit e of that notorious passage i n the Inaugura l Address , and the fact that according t o the Times report , too, Mr.
Gladston e said he believe d this intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and powe r not t o be confine d to classe s in easy circumstances Mar x has the impudenc e to write in the Volksstaat of June 1 : 'So, on April 16 , 1863, Mr.
Gladston e declare d both in form and in conten t in the House of Commons , as reporte d in his own organ, The Times, o n April 17, 1863, that this intoxicating augmentatio n of wealth and power is entirely confine d to the classes possessed o f property ' " a Si duo faciunt idem, non est idem.
Whe n two do the same, it is not the same .
When Mar x has Gladston e say: This intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealt h and power is entirely confine d to classes of property , this is "lyingl y added" , a "notoriou s passage" , "completel y forged".
Whe n the Times repor t has Gladston e say: "This augmentatio n I have describe d as an intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and powe r is entirely confine d to classes of property, " then this is only "formall y more contracted " than the Hansar d report, i n which this sentenc e is missing , and the "direct opposit e of that" (exactl y the same) "notoriou s passag e in the Inaugura l Address".
An d when Marx then quote s the Times repor t in confirmation o f this passage , Mr.
Brentan o states: ".
.
.
and finall y he has the impudence t o base himself on newspape r reports which directly contradict him" .
This reall y does deman d great "impudence" .
However , Marx has his on his face, and nowher e else.
b With the aid of "impudence " which may easily be distinguishe d from tha t of Marx, Anonymous , alias Lujo Brentano, then manage s to have Gladston e say that he "believes thi s intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power not to be confined t o classes in easy circumstances" .
Actually, accordin g to The Times an d Hansard , Gladston e says he would look with pain and apprehensio n upon this intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power if he believe d it was confine d to the classes in easy circumstances , and he adds, accordin g to The Times, tha t it is, however , "confine d to classes of property" .

In the Case of Brentano Versus Mar x 103 "Indeed," th e righteousl y indignan t Anonymou s finally exclaims , "to describ e these practice s we know only one word, a word with which Marx is very familia r (see Capital, p .
257 a): they are simply 'nefarious'.
" Whose practices , Mr.
Lujo Brentano ? II Marx's repl y (Der Volksstaat, August 7 , 1872, Documents , No.
6b) is good-nature d enoug h to deal with all the stir create d by Mr.
Brentan o about Professo r Beesly , The Theory of the Exchanges, etc.
; we leave this aside as being of secondar y importance .
In conclusion, however , it produce s anothe r two facts which are absolutely decisiv e for the main issue.
The "lyingl y added " passage i s to be found, besides in the Times report , in the report s of two other Londo n mornin g paper s of April 17, 1863.
According t o The Morning Star, Gladston e stated : "This augmentation"—whic h had just been describe d as an intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power—"i s an augmentatio n entirel y confine d to the classes possesse d of property.
" According t o The Morning Advertiser: "The augmentatio n stated"—a n intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power—"is a n augmentatio n entirel y confine d to the classe s possesse d of property.
" For any other opponent , these proofs would be "absolutel y devastating".
Not , however , for the anonymou s Brentano.
His reply (Concordia, Augus t 22, 1872, Documents , No.
I e), which betrays undiminishe d impudence , was never seen by Marx, since numbers o f Concordia late r than that dated July 11 were not sent to him.
I myself first read this reply in Brentano' s reprint (Meine Polemik, etc.
, 1890 d), and must therefor e take note of it here, for better o r for worse.
"The dogged mendacity wit h which he" (Marx) "clings to the distorte d quotatio n .
.
.
is astonishin g even for someon e for whom no means are too base for his subversive plans.
" The quotatio n remain s "forged" , and the Times repor t "shows the exac t opposite , since The Times an d Hansar d fully coincide" .
The confidenc e of this declaratio n is, however , simply child's play a K.

9* compared t o the "impudence " with which Mr.
Brentan o suddenly gives us the followin g information : "Marx's secon d metho d of obscurin g the Times repor t was simply to suppress , in his Germa n translation , the relativ e clause which showe d that Gladston e had only said that the augmentatio n of wealth , which was shown by the incom e tax returns, was confined to the classes of property, sinc e the workin g classes were not subject t o income tax, and that thus nothin g about the increas e in the prosperit y of the workin g classes could be learne d from the income tax returns ; not, however , that the workin g classes in reality had been exclude d from the extraordinar y augmentation o f nationa l wealth.
" Thus whe n The Times say s that the oft-mentione d augmentatio n is confine d to the classes of property , then it says the opposit e of the "lyingl y added " sentence , which says the same.
As regards the "simply suppresse d relativ e clause" , we shall not allow Mr.
Brentano to get away with that, if he will bear with us for a moment.
An d now he has happily survive d the first great leap, it is easier for him to assert that black is white, and white black.
Now that he has manage d to deal with The Times, The Morning Star and The Morning Advertiser wil l give him little trouble .
"For thes e papers , even as he" (Marx ) "quote s them, speak for us.
After Gladstone ha s said, accordin g to both papers , that he does not believe " (which , as we know , Mr.
Brentan o claims) "this intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power is confine d to the classes which find themselve s in pleasan t circumstances , he continued: 'This grea t increas e of wealth takes no cognizance at all o f the conditio n of the labourin g population .
The augmentation which I have described is an augmentation entirely confined to the classes possessed of property.
' The contex t and the use of the expressio n 'take cognizance ' show clearl y that this increas e and the augmentation o f the increas e cited, and the citing, " (sic\) "ar e intende d to indicat e those discernibl e in the incom e tax returns.
" The Jesui t who originate d the saying Si duo faciunt idem, non est idem was a bungler compare d to the anonymou s Brentano.
When The Times, The Morning Star an d The Morning Advertiser declar e unanimously tha t the sentenc e which Brentano claims Mar x had "lyingly added " was actuall y uttere d by Gladstone , then these papers spea k unanimousl y "for" Mr.
Brentano .
And whe n Marx quotes thi s sentenc e verbatim , this is a "lying quotation" , "impudent mendacity" , "complet e forgery" , "a lie", etc.
And if Marx canno t appreciat e this, that passes the understandin g of our Anonymous , alias Lujo Brentano, and he finds it "simpl y nefarious".
But let us deal with the alleged "lying addition " once and for all by quotin g the report s on our passag e in all Londo n mornin g papers o n April 17, 1863.
We have alread y had The Times, The Morning Star an d The Morning Advertiser.
Daily Telegraph: "I may say for one, that I should look almost with apprehensio n and alarm on this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power if it were my belief that it was confined to the masses who are in easy circumstances .
This questio n to wealth takes no cognizanc e at all of the conditio n of the labourin g population .
The augmentation stated is an augmentation entirely confined to the classes possessed of property.
" Morning Herald: "I may say that I for one would look with fear and apprehensio n at this intoxicating increase of wealth if I were of opinion that it is confined to the classes in easy circumstances .
This great increase of wealth whic h I have described , and which is founded on accurate return s is confined entirely to the augmentation of capital, and takes no account of the poorer classes.
" Morning Post: "I may say, I for one, would look with fear and apprehensio n when I conside r this grea t increas e of wealth if I believed that its benefits were confine d to the classes in easy circumstances .
This augmentation of wealth whic h I have described , and whic h is founded on accurate return s is confined entirely to the augmentation of capital, and takes no account of the augmentatio n of wealth of the poorer classes.
" Daily News: "I may say that I for one would look with fear and apprehensio n when I consider this great increase of wealth if I believed that its benefits were confine d to the classe s in easy circumstances .
This augmentation of wealth whic h I have described, and which is founded upon accurat e returns , is confined entirely to the augmentation of capital, and takes no account of the augmentatio n of wealth of the poorer classes.
" Standard: "I may say that I for one would look with fear and apprehensio n at this intoxicating increase of wealth if I were of the opinion that it was confined to the classes in easy circumstances .
This great increase of wealth whic h I have described , and whic h is founded on the accurate return s is confined entirely to the augmentation of capital, and takes no account of the poorer classes.
" The eigh t newspaper s cited here were, as far as I know, the only morning paper s publishe d in Londo n at that time .
Thei r testimony i s "convincing" .
Four of them— The Times, The Morning Star, The Morning Advertiser, Daily Telegraph—give th e sentenc e in exactly th e form whic h Marx had "lyingl y added" .
The augmenta -tion describe d earlie r as an intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealt h and powe r "is entirely confined to classes of property".
Th e four others — Morning Herald, Morning Post, Daily News an d Standard— give it in an "only formall y more contracted " version , by which it is furthe r reinforced ; this augmentatio n "is confined entirely to the augmentation of capital".
The eigh t newspaper s cited all have their separat e complet e staff of parliamentar y reporters .
They are thus the same numbe r of witnesses , fully independen t of one another .
In additio n they are in their totality impartial , since they adhere to the most diverse party tendencies .
And both of the two version s of the irrepressibl e sentence ar e vouche d for by Tories and Whigs and radicals .
According t o four of them, Gladston e said: entirely confine d to classes o f property .
Accordin g to four others he said: entirel y confined t o the augmentatio n of capital .
Eight irreproachabl e witnesses thu s testify that Gladston e really uttere d the sentence .
The only questio n is whethe r this was in the milder version used by Marx , or in the stronge r version given in four of the reports .
Against the m all, in isolate d grandeu r stands—Hansard .
But Hansard i s not irreproachabl e like the mornin g papers .
Hansard' s reports ar e subjec t to censorship , the censorshi p of the speaker s themselves.
An d precisel y for this reason "it is the custom " to quote accordin g to Hansard .
Eight non-suspec t witnesse s agains t one suspec t witness ! But what doe s that worry our victory-confiden t Anonymous ? Precisel y because th e report s of the eight mornin g paper s put "that notorious passage " in Gladstone' s mouth , precisel y because of this, they "spea k for" our Anonymous , precisel y by this the y prove even more tha t Marx "lyingl y added " it.
Indeed, nothin g actuall y exceed s the "impudence " of the anonymous Brentano.
Ill In reality , however , the ostentatiou s impudenc e we had to admire i n Mr.
Brentano , is nothin g but a tactical manoeuvre .
He has discovere d that the attack on the "lyingl y added " sentenc e has failed, an d that he must seek a defensiv e position .
He has found it; all that has to be done now is to retreat to this new position .
Already i n his first reply to Marx (Documents , No.
5a) Mr.
Brentan o hints at his intention , though bashfull y as yet.
The fatal Times repor t compel s him to do so.
This report, it is true, contains th e "notorious" , the "lyingl y added " passage , but that is actually besid e the point.
For since it "fully coincide s materially " with Hansard, i t says "the direct opposit e of that notoriou s passage" , although i t contain s it word for word.
Thus it is no longer a question o f the wordin g of the "notoriou s passage" , but of its meaning.
I t is no longe r a questio n of denyin g the passage' s a See this volume , pp.

existence, bu t of claimin g that it means the opposit e of what it says.
And Mar x having declare d in his second reply that lack of time forces hi m to end, once and for all, his pleasurabl e exchang e of opinions wit h his anonymou s opponent, 3 the latter can ventur e to deal wit h even greate r confidenc e with this subject , which is not exactly prope r at that.
This he does in his rejoinder , reproduce d here as No.
7 of the documents.
15 Here he claims that Marx attempt s to obscure th e Times report , which materiall y fully coincide s with Hansard , and this is in three ways.
Firstly b y an incorrec t translatio n of CLASSE S WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES.
0 I leave aside this point as absolutel y irrelevant .
It is generally know n that Marx had a comman d of the Englis h language quit e differen t from that of Mr.
Brentano .
But exactl y what Mr .
Gladston e though t when he used this expressio n — and whether h e though t anything—i t is quite impossibl e to say today, 27 years later, even for himself .
The second poin t is that Marx "simpl y suppressed " a certain "relative clause " in the Times report .
The passag e in questio n is previously cite d at length in section II, p.
7.
d By suppressin g this relative clause , Marx is suppose d to have suppresse d for his readers th e fact that the augmentatio n of wealth, as shown by the income ta x returns , is confine d to classes which posses s property , since the labourin g classes do not fall under the income tax, and thus nothin g may be learne d from the return s about the increas e in prosperit y amongs t the workers ; this does not mean, however , that in reality the labourin g classes remain exclude d from the extraordinary augmentatio n of nationa l wealth .
The sentenc e in the Times repor t runs, in Mr.
Brentano' s own translation: "The augmentatio n I have described , and the figures of which are based, I think, upo n accurat e returns , is entirely confine d to classes of property.
" The relativ e clause which Marx so maliciousl y "suppressed " consists o f the words: "and the figures of which are based, I think, upon accurat e returns" .
By the persistent , since twice repeated , suppression o f these highly importan t words, so the story goes, Marx wishe d to concea l from his reader s that the said augmenta -a See this volume , p.

tion was an augmentatio n solely of the income subject to income tax, i n other word s the income of the "classe s which posses s property" .
Does his moral indignatio n at the fact that he had run agroun d with "mendacity " make Mr.
Brentan o blind? O r does he think that he can make all sorts of allegations , since Marx will no longer reply in any case? The fact is that the incriminate d sentenc e begins, accordin g to Marx, both in the Inaugura l Addres s and in Capital, wit h the words: "From 1842 to 1852 THE TAXABLE INCOME of the countr y increase d by 6 per cent.
.
.
In the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it has .

.
"a etc.
Does Mr.
Brentan o know anothe r "taxabl e income " in Englan d apart fro m that subjec t to incom e tax? And has the highly important "relativ e clause " anythin g at all to add to this clear declaration tha t only incom e subjec t to incom e tax is under discussion? O r does he believe , as it almost appears , that people "forge" Gladstone' s budge t speeches , make "lying additions " or "suppress" somethin g in them if they quote them without , à la Brentano, als o providing th e reader with an essay on Englis h income ta x in which they "falsify " incom e tax into the bargain , as Marx prove d (Documents , No.
6),b and as Mr.
Brentan o was forced t o admit (Documents , No.
7).
c And when the "lyingl y added" sentenc e simply says that the augmentatio n just mentione d by Mr.
Gladston e was confine d to classes of property , does it not say essentiall y the same, since only classes of propert y pay incom e tax? Bu t of course , whilst Mr.
Brentan o creates a deafenin g hullabaloo a t the front door about this sentenc e as a Marxia n falsification an d insolen t mendacity , he himsel f allows it to slip in quietly throug h the back door.
Mr.
Brentan o knew ver y well that Marx quoted Mr.
Gladston e as speakin g about "taxabl e income " and no other.
For in his first attack (Documents , No.
3), he quote s the passag e from the Inaugural Address , and even translate d TAXABL E as "liable to tax".
d If he now "suppresses " this in his rejoinder , and if from now on until his pamphle t of 1890 he protest s again and again that Marx concealed, intentionall y and maliciously , the fact that Gladston e was speakin g here solely of those income s liable to incom e tax — should we now sling his own expression s back at him: "lying", "forgery" , "impuden t mendacity" , "simpl y nefarious" ? a See this volume , p.

To continu e with the text: " Thirdly an d finally , Marx attempte d to concea l the agreemen t betwee n the Times repor t and the Hansar d report by failing to quote those sentence s in which, according t o The Times too , Gladston e directl y and explicitl y testifie d to the elevation o f the British workin g class.
" In his second reply to the anonymou s Brentano, 3 Marx had to prove tha t he had not "lyingly added" the "notorious " sentence , and in additio n had to reject the insolen t claim made by Anonymous: i n relatio n to this point , the only point in question , the Times repor t and the Hansar d repor t "fully coincide d materially", althoug h the former include d the sentenc e in questio n verbatim, an d the latter exclude d it verbatim .
For this, the only point at issue, it was absolutel y irrelevan t what Mr.
Gladston e had to say about the elevatio n of the British workin g class.
On the other hand the Inaugura l Address—an d this is the document whic h Brentano accuses o f falsifyin g a quotatio n — states explicitl y on p.
4,b only a few lines before the "notorious " sentence, tha t the Chancello r of the Excheque r (Gladstone) , during th e millenniu m of free trade, told the House of Commons : "The averag e conditio n of the British laboure r has improve d in a degree we know to be extraordinar y and unexample d in the history of any countr y or any age.
" And thes e are precisel y the words which, accordin g to Brentano, Marx maliciousl y suppressed .
In the whole polemic , from his first retort to Marx in 1872 (Documents, No .
5C) down to his introductio n and appendi x to Meine Polemik, etc.
, 1890 , Mr.
Brentan o suppresses, wit h a sleight of hand which we must on no accoun t describ e as "insolen t mendacity", th e fact that Marx directl y quoted in the Inaugura l Address thes e Gladstonia n declaration s about the unparallele d improvement i n the situatio n of the workers .
And in this rejoinder, which , as alread y mentioned , remaine d unknow n to Marx up to his death, and to me until the publicatio n of the pamphlet Meine Polemik, etc.

twisted Gladstone' s speech; Mar x has Gladston e say that, it goes, the riches of the rich have grown enormously , but that the poor, the working population , have at the most become less poor.
But in fact Gladstone said , in plain words, that the conditio n of the worker s had improved t o an unexample d degree .
This secon d line of defenc e was pierced by the irresistibl e fact that precisel y in the incriminate d document , in the Inaugura l Address, thes e same Gladstonia n words were quoted explicitly .
And Mr.
Brentan o knew this .
"But what does it matter? The readers" o f the Concordia "canno t check up on him!" Incidentally, regardin g what Gladston e really said, on this we shall hav e a few short words to say in a little while.
In conclusion , Mr.
Brentano , in the security , first of his anonymity, an d second of Marx's declaratio n that he has no wish to bothe r with him further , indulge s in the followin g privat e jollity: "When Mr .
Marx finally ends his article by breakin g into abuse, we can assure him tha t his opponen t could desire nothin g more than the confessio n of his weakness whic h lies herein .
Abuse is the weapo n of those whose other means of defence hav e run out.
" The reade r can check for himsel f the extent to which Marx "breaks int o abuse" in his rejoinder .
As far as Mr.
Brentan o is concerned, w e have already presente d some choice bouquet s from his attestation s of politeness .
The "lies", "impuden t mendacity" , "lying quotation" , "simpl y nefarious" , etc.
, heaped upon Marx' s head by all means constitut e an edifyin g "confessio n of weakness" , and an unmistakeabl e sign that Mr.
Brentano' s "other means of defence hav e run out".
IV Here end s the first act of our song and dance.
Mr.
Brentano , mysterious thoug h not yet a privy councillor, 3 had achieve d what he could scarcel y have hoped to achieve .
Admittedly , things had gone badl y enoug h for him regardin g the sentenc e allegedl y "lyingly added" ; and in fact he had droppe d this origina l charge .
But he had sought out a new line of defence , and on this line— he had had the last word, and with that you can, in the world of German professordom , claim you have stood your ground .
And with this he could brag, at least amongs t his own, that he had a Play on words : "geheimnisvoll" — mysterious , "Geheimrat" — privy coun-cillor.

victoriously repelle d Marx's onslaught , and slain Marx himsel f in the literar y world .
The luckles s Marx, however , never heard a dying wor d about his slaughte r in the Concordia; o n the contrary , he had the "impudence " to live on for anothe r eleven years, eleven year s of mountin g succes s for him, eleven years of uninterrupted growt h in the numerica l strengt h of his supporter s in all countries , eleven years of constantl y growin g recognitio n of his merits .
Mr.
Brentan o and consort s wisely refraine d from freein g the blinded Mar x of his self-deception , or making it clear to him that he had actuall y been dead for a long time.
But after he really did die in 1883, they could no longer contain themselves , their fingers itched to o much.
And now Mr.
Sedley Taylo r appeare d on the scene, wit h a letter to The Times (Documents , No.
8).
a He provoke d things himself, if he or his friend Brentano, as it almost appears , had not actuall y concocte d it with M.
Emile de Laveleye.
I n that stilted style which betray s a certain recognitio n of his dubiou s cause, he states that it appears to him "extremely singula r that it was reserve d for Professo r Brentano to expose , eight years later , the mala fides c" of Marx.
And the n begin the vaingloriou s phrase s about the masterl y conduct o f the attack by the godlik e Brentano, and the speedil y ensuring deadl y shifts of the notoriou s Marx, etc.
What things were like in reality our readers have already seen.
All that fell into deadly shift s was only Brentano' s claim about the lying additio n of the sentenc e in question .
And finall y in conclusion : "On Brentano' s showing , by a detailed compariso n of texts, that the reports of The Times an d of "Hansard " agreed in utterly excludin g the meanin g which craftily isolate d quotatio n had put upon Mr.
Gladstone' s words, Marx withdre w from furthe r controvers y under the plea of want of time!" The "detaile d compariso n of texts" is simply farcical .
Anony -mous Brentano quotes only Hansard .
Marx supplie s him with the Times report , which include s verbati m the controversia l sentenc e missing i n Hansard .
Mr.
Brentan o now also quoted the Times report, an d this three lines further than Marx quoted it.

Taylor calls this daredevi l operatio n a "detaile d compariso n of texts".
Further.
I t is simply not true that Marx then withdre w under the plea of want of time.
And Mr.
Sedley Taylor knew this, or it was his busines s to know it.
We have seen that before this Marx delivered proo f to the anonymou s godlik e Brentano that the reports i n The Morning Star an d The Morning Advertiser als o contained th e "lyingl y added " sentence .
Only after this did he declare tha t he could waste no more time on Anonymous .
The furthe r polemi c betwee n Mr.
Sedley Taylo r and Eleano r Marx (Documents , Nos 9, 10 and lla) showe d in the first place that he did not try for a momen t to maintai n the origina l charge about th e lying additio n of a sentence .
He went so far as to claim that this was "of very subordinat e importance" .
Once again the direct disavowa l of a fact which he knew, or which it was his business t o know.
In any case we take note of his admissio n that this charge does not hold water, and congratulat e his friend Brentano on this.
So what is the charg e now? Simply that of Mr.
Brentano' s second lin e of defenc e that Marx had wished to distort the sense of Gladstone' s speech— a new charge of which, as we have noted, Marx neve r knew anything .
In any case, this brings us to a completely differen t field.
What was concerne d to begin with was a definit e fact: did Marx lyingly add this sentenc e or not? It is now no longe r denied that Marx victoriousl y rebuffe d this charge .
The new charg e of distorte d quotation , however , leads us into the field of subjectiv e opinions , which necessaril y vary.
De gustibus non est disputandum.
b One perso n may regar d as unimportant — intrinsically o r for the purpos e of quotation—somethin g which another perso n declare s to be importan t and decisive .
The conservative wil l [never] quote acceptabl y for the liberal, the liberal never fo r the conservative , the socialis t never for one of them or both of them.
The party man whose own comrad e is quoted against hi m by an opponen t regularl y discover s that the essentia l passage, th e passag e determinin g the real sense, has been omitte d in quotation .
This is such an everyda y occurrence , somethin g permitting s o many individua l viewpoints , that nobody attache s the slightest significanc e to such charges .
Had Mr.
Brentan o utilised See this volume , pp.
156-63.
— Ed There ca n be no argumen t about taste.
— Ed his anonimit y to level this charge , and this charge alone, against Marx, the n Marx would scarcel y have regarde d it as worth the trouble o f a single word in reply.
In order to accomplis h this new twist with that eleganc e peculia r to him alone , Mr.
Sedley Taylo r finds it necessar y to repudiat e thrice hi s friend and comrad e Brentano.
He repudiate s him first when he drops his originall y sole charge of "lying addition" , and even denie s its existenc e as origina l and sole.
He repudiate s him further whe n he summaril y discard s the infallibl e Hansard , to quote exclusivel y from whic h is the "custom " of the ethica l Brentano, 3 and uses instead the Times report , which the selfsam e Brentano calls "necessaril y bungling" .
Thirdly , he repudiate s him, and his own first letter to The Times int o the bargain , by seekin g the "quotatio n in dispute " no longer in the Inaugura l Addres s but in Capital.
An d this for the simple reason that he had never laid his hand upon the Inaugura l Address , to which he "had the hardihood" t o refer in his letter to The Times] Shortly afte r his controvers y with Eleano r Marx he vainly sought this Addres s in the British Museum , and was introduce d there to his opponent , whom he asked whethe r she coul d not obtain a copy for him.
Whereupon , I sought out a copy amongs t my papers , and Eleanor sen t it to him.
The "detaile d compariso n of texts" which this enable d him to make apparentl y convince d him that silence was the best reply.
And in fact it would be superfluou s to add a single word to Eleanor Marx' s retort (Documents , No.

This Prefac e forced Mr.
Brentan o to make a reply: this was the pamphle t Meine Polemik mit Karl Marx usw.
by Lujo Brentano, Berlin , 1890.
Her e he has reprinte d his anonymou s and now finally legitimate d Concordia articles , and Marx' s answer s in the Volksstaat, accom-panied b y an introductio n and two appendices , with which, for better o r worse, we are oblige d to deal.

— Ed Above al l we note that here too there is no longer any mentio n of the "lyingl y added " sentence .
The sentenc e from the Inaugura l Address i s quoted right on the first page, and it is then claime d that Gladston e had "state d in direct oppositio n to Karl Marx's claim" tha t these figures referre d only to those paying income tax (which Mar x had Gladston e say too, since he explicitl y limits these figures t o taxable income ) but that the conditio n of the workin g class ha d at the same time improve d in unexample d fashio n (which Mar x also has Gladston e say, only nine lines before the challenged quotation) .
I would reques t the reader to compar e for himself th e Inaugura l Addres s (Documents , No.
1a) with Mr.
Brentano' s claim (Documents , No.
13b) in order to see how Mr.
Brentan o either "lyingl y adds" , or fabricate s in anothe r manner, a contradictio n where there is none at all.
But since the charge abou t the lyingl y added sentenc e has broke n down ignominiously, Mr.
Brentano , contrary t o his better knowledge , must attemp t to take in his reader s by telling them Marx tried to suppress th e fact that Gladston e had spoken here only of "taxabl e income", o r the incom e of classes which posses s property .
And here Mr.
Brentan o does not even notice that his first accusatio n is thus turne d into the opposite , in that the second is a slap in the face of the first.
Having happil y accomplishe d this "forgery" , he is moved to draw th e attentio n of the Concordia t o the "forgery " allegedl y committed b y Marx, and the Concordia the n asks him to send it an article agains t Marx.
What now follow s is too deliciou s not to be given verbatim : "The articl e was not signed by me; this was done, on the one hand, at the request o f the editors in the interests of the reputation of their paper, and , on the other hand, I had all the less objection , since followin g earlier literary controversie s pursued b y Marx it was to be expecte d that this time too he would heap persona l insults o n his adversary , and for this reason it could only be amusing t o leave him in the dark as to the identit y of his adversary.
" So the editors of the Concordia wishe d "in the interest s of the reputation o f their paper " that Mr.
Brentan o should kee p his name quiet ! What a reputatio n this implie s for Mr.
Brentan o amongst hi s colleague s in his own party.
We can well believe that this actuall y happene d to him, but that he himsel f shouts it from the rooftop s is a really pyramida l achievemen t on his part.
However, thi s is somethin g which he has to settle with himself and with the editors of the Concordia.
a See this volume , pp.
132-33.
— Ed b Ibid.

169-72 — Ed Since "i t was to be expecte d that Marx would heap persona l insults o n his adversary" , it could naturall y "only be amusin g to leave him in the dark as to the identit y of his adversary" .
It was hitherto a mystery as to how you can heap personal insult s upon a person yo u do not know .
You can only get persona l if you know something o f the person in question .
But Mr.
Brentano , made anonymous i n the interest s of the paper' s reputation , relieve d his adversary o f this trouble .
He himsel f waded in with "insults" , first with the "lyingl y added " printe d in bold type, and then with "impudent mendacity" , "simply nefarious" , etc.
Mr.
Brentano , the non-anonymous, obviousl y made a slip of the pen here.
Mr.
Bren -tano "on the other hand, had all the less objection " to the anonymit y imposed upo n himself , not so that the well-know n Marx could "heap persona l insults" upon the unknow n Brentano, but so that the concealed Brentano could do this to the well-know n Marx.
And thi s is suppose d to "be amusing" ! That's what actuall y transpired, bu t not because Mr.
Brentan o wanted it .
Marx, as later his daughter , and now myself, have all tried to see the amusin g aspect of this polemic .
Such success as we have had, be it great or small, ha s been at the expens e of Mr.
Brentano .
His article s have been anythin g but "amusing" .
The only contribution s to amuse -ment are the rapier-thrust s aimed by Marx at the shady side of his "left-in-the-dark person" , which the man at the receivin g end now wishes t o laugh off belatedl y as the "loutishnes s of his scurrilou s polemics".
Th e Junkers , the priests , the lawyer s and other right and prope r opponent s of the incisiv e polemic s of Voltaire , Beaumarchais and Pau l Louis Courie r objecte d to the "loutishnes s of their scurrilou s polemics" , which has not prevente d these examples o f "loutishness " from being regarde d as model s and masterpieces today .
And we have had so much pleasur e from these an d similar "scurrilou s polemics " that a hundre d Brentanos should no t succee d in draggin g us down to the level of Germa n university polemics , where there is nothing but the impoten t rage of green envy, and the most desolat e boredom .
However, Mr.
Brentan o once agai n regard s his reader s as so duped tha t he can lay it on thick again with a brazen face: "When i t was shown that The Times to o .
.
.
carried this" (Gladstone's ) "speec h in a sense accordin g with the shorthan d report , he" (Marx) "acted, as the editors of the Concordia wrote , like the cuttlefish , which dims th e water with a dark fluid, in order to make pursui t by its enemy more difficult , i.
e.
he tried as hard as he could to hide the subject of controvers y by clingin g to completel y inconsequentia l secondary matters.
" If the Times report , which contain s the "lyingl y added " sentence wor d for word, accord s in sense with the "shorthand " report—should b e with Hansard—whic h suppresse s it word for word, an d if Mr.
Brentan o once agai n boasts that he had demonstrated this , this can mean nothin g other than the charge concerning th e "lyingl y added " sentenc e has been completel y dropped — though shamefacedl y and quietly—an d Mr.
Brentano , forced fro m the offensiv e onto the defensive , is retreatin g to his second lin e of defence .
We simply note this; we believe that in sections II I and IV we have thoroughl y broken throug h the centre of this second line, and turned both flanks .
But the n the genuin e universit y polemicis t appears .
When Brentano, emboldened b y the scent of victory , has thus driven his enemy int o the corner , the foe acts like the cuttlefish , darkenin g the wate r and hiding the subjec t of controvers y by focussin g attention o n completel y inconsequentia l secondar y matters .
The Jesuit s say: Si fecisti, nega.
I f you have perpetrate d something, den y it.
The Germa n universit y polemicis t goes further and says : If you have perpetrate d a shady lawye'r' s trick, then lay it at your opponent' s door.
Scarcel y has Marx quoted The Theory of the Exchanges an d Professo r Beesly , and this simply becaus e they had quote d the dispute d passag e like he had, than Brentano the cuttlefish "clings " to them with all the sucker s of his ten feet, and spreads suc h a torrent of his "dark fluid" all around that you must loo k hard and grasp firmly if you do not wish to lose from eye and hand the real "subjec t of controversy" , namel y the allegedly "lyingl y added " sentence .
In his rejoinder , exactly the same method .
First he starts anothe r squabbl e with Marx about the meanin g of the expressio n CLASSE S IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES , a squabble whic h under the best of circumstance s could produc e nothing bu t that very "obscuration " which Mr.
Brentan o desires.
And the n dark fluid is again squirte d in the matter of that renowned relativ e clause which Marx had maliciousl y suppressed , and which , as we have shown , could perfectl y well be omitted , since the fact to which it indirectl y alluded had already been stated quite clearl y in an earlier sentenc e of the speech which had been quoted b y Marx.
And thirdly , our cuttlefis h has enoug h dark sauce lef t over to obscur e once again the subject of controversy , by claiming tha t Marx has again suppresse d some sentence s from The Times—sentences whic h had absolutel y nothin g to do with the single poin t at issue betwee n them at that time, th e allegedl y lyingly added sentence .
And the same waste of sepia in the presen t self-apologia .
First, naturally, The Theory of the Exchanges mus t be the whippin g boy.
Then, al l of a sudden, we are confronte d with the Lassallea n "iron law of wages" with which, as everyon e knows , Marx was as little connected a s Mr.
Brentan o with the inventio n of gunpowder ; Mr.
Brentan o must kno w that in the first volume of Capital Mar x specifically denie d all and every responsibilit y for any conclusion s drawn b y Lassalle, 3 and that in the same book Marx describe s the law of wages as a function of differin g variable s and very elastic, thus anythin g but iron.
But when the ink-squirtin g has started there is no stoppin g it: the Halle congress, 138 Liebknech t and Bebel, Gladstone' s budge t speech of 1843, the Englis h trade unions, al l manne r of far-fetche d things are resorte d to so as, faced wit h an opponen t who has gone over to the offensive , to cover by self-apologi a the defensiv e line of Mr.
Brentan o and his lofty philanthropi c principles , treated so scornfull y by the wicked socialists.
On e gets the impressio n that a round dozen cuttlefis h were helpin g him do the "hushin g up" here.
And all of this becaus e Mr.
Brentan o himself know s that he has hopelessly ru n agroun d with his claim about the "lyingl y added " sentence, an d has not got the courag e to withdra w this claim openly an d honourably .
To use his own words : "Had he " Brentano "simply admitte d that he had been misled by this book", Hansard, ".
.
.
on e might have been surprise d that he had relied upon such a source" as absolutel y reliabl e "but the mistak e would at least have been rectified .
But for him ther e was no questio n of this.
" Instead th e ink was squirte d in gallons for obscurin g purposes , and if I have to be so discursiv e here, this is only becaus e I must first dispos e of all these far-fetche d margina l questions , and disperse th e obscurin g ink in order to keep eye and hand on the real subjec t of the controversy .
Meanwhile Mr.
Brentan o has anothe r piece of informatio n ïor us in petto? whic h in fact "could only be amusing" .
He has, in fact, been so lamentabl y treated that he can find no peace and quiet until he has moane d to us about all his misfortune .
First the Concordia suppresse s his name in the interest s of the reputatio n of the paper .
Mr.
Brentan o is magnanimou s enoug h to consen t to this sacrific e in the interest s of the good cause.
Then Marx unleashes upo n him the loutishnes s of his scurrilou s polemics .
This too he swallows .
Only he wished to reply to this "with the verbatim publicatio n of the entire polemic" .

The first contain s extract s from The Theory of the Exchanges, intende d to prove that this book was one of the main source s from which Marx concocte d his Capital.
I shall not go into detail about this repeate d waste of sepia.
I only have to deal with the old charge from the Concordia.
His whol e life long Marx could not and would not please Mr.
Brentano .
Mr.
Brentan o thus certainl y has a whole bottomles s sack of complaint s agains t Marx, and I would be an idiot to let myself i n for this.
There would be no end to pleasin g him.
But it is naive that here, at the end of the quotations , "the reproduction o f the real budget speech " is demande d from Marx.
So that is what Mr.
Brentan o understands b y correc t quotation .
However, i f the whole actual speech is always to be reproduced , then no speech has ever been quoted withou t "forgery" .
In the second appendi x Mr.
Brentan o has a go at me.
In the fourth editio n of Capital, volum e one, I drew attentio n to The Morning Star i n connectio n with the allegedl y false quotation .
Mr.
Brentan o utilises thi s to once again obscur e completely , with spurts o f sepia, the origina l point at issue, the passag e in the Inaugural Address , and instead of this to hit out at the passag e in Capital alread y quoted by Mr.
S.
Taylor.
In order to prove that my sourc e of referenc e was false, and that Marx could only have taken th e "forge d quotation " from The Theory of the Exchanges, Mr.
Brentan o prints in paralle l column s the reports of The Times and The Morning Star an d the quotatio n accordin g to Capital.

Mr.
Brentan o has The Morning Star begi n its report with the words " I MUST SAY FOR ONE" etc.
He thus claims that the precedin g sentences o n the growth of taxable incom e from 1842 to 1852, and from 1853 to 1861 are missin g in The Morning Star; fro m which it naturall y follows that Marx did not use The Morning Star but The Theory of the Exchanges.
"The readers " of his pamphle t "with whom he is concerned , cannot chec k up on him!" But other people can, and they discove r that this passag e is certainl y to be found in The Morning Star.

An d now the sentenc e is nevertheles s to be found in The Morning Star, i n fact exactly as in Marx, and the incriminatin g gap is Mr.

b Then follow s the Germa n translatio n of both quotations.
— Ed.
10* In Capital th e quotatio n breaks off with the passage : "Whether th e extreme s of povert y are less, I do not presum e to say.
" Now in the report s in The Times an d The Morning Star th e sentence doe s not end here; separate d only by a comma, there follow th e words : "but the averag e conditio n of the British labourer , we have the happines s to know to be extraordinary " (in The Times: ha s improve d during the last 20 years in a degre e which we know to be extraordinary ) "and which we may almos t pronounce t o be unexample d in the history of any countr y and of any age".
Thus Mar x breaks off here in mid-sentence , "has Gladston e stop in mid-sentence" , "makin g this sentenc e quite meaningless" .
And alread y in his rejoinde r (Documents , No.
7a) Mr.
Brentan o calls this an "absolutel y senseles s version" .
Gladstone's sentence : "Whethe r the extreme s of povert y are less, I do not presum e to say" is a quite definit e statement , complete i n itself.
If it makes sense, it makes sense when taken in isolation.
I f it makes no sense, no additio n howeve r long, tacked on behin d a "yet", can give it sense.
If the sentenc e in Marx's quotation i s "completel y senseless" , then this is not due to Marx who quote d it, but to Mr.
Gladston e who uttere d it.
To prob e more deeply this importan t case, let us now turn to the only sourc e which , accordin g to Mr.
Brentano , it is the "custom" t o quote, let us turn to Hansard , pure of all origina l sin.
According t o Mr.
Brentano' s own translation , it says: "I will not presum e to determin e whethe r the wide interva l which separate s the extremes o f wealth and povert y is less or more wide than it has been in forme r times"—full stop.
And onl y after thi s full stop does the new sentenc e begin: "But if we look to the averag e conditio n of the British labourer" , etc.
Thus if Marx likewis e sets a full stop here, he does just as the virtuous Hansar d does; and if Mr.
Brentan o makes thi s full stop a new crim e on the part of Marx, and claims that Marx has Gladstone sto p in the mid-sentence , then he has relied upon the "necessarily bunglin g newspape r reports" , and he can only blame himself fo r the consequences .
Thus the argumen t collapse s that Marx ha s made the sentenc e completel y senseles s throug h his full stop; this comes not from him but from Mr.
Gladstone , and let Mr.
Brentan o now correspon d with him abou t the sense or nonsense o f the sentence ; we have nothin g more to do with the matter.
a See this volume , pp.
152-54.
— Ed.
For Mr.
Brentan o is anywa y in correspondenc e with Mr.
Glad-stone.
Wha t he has written to the latter we do not learn, of course, and we only learn very little of what Mr.
Gladston e has written to him.
In any case, Mr.
Brentan o has publishe d from Gladstone' s letters tw o meagr e little sentence s (Documents , No.
16a) and in my reply (Documents , No.
I7b) I showed that "this arbitrar y mosaic of sentences tor n from their context " prove s nothin g at all in Mr.
Brentano' s favour whilst the fact that he indulge s in this sort of ragge d publication , instead of publishin g the whole correspon -dence, speak s volume s against him .
But let us assume for a momen t that these two little sentence s only permitte d the interpretatio n most favourabl e to Mr.
Bren -tano.
What then ? "You ar e completel y correct , and Marx completel y incorrect.
" "I undertoo k no change s of any sort.
" These are the allege d words—for Mr .
Gladston e does not usually write in German , as far as I know—o f the former minister .
Does thi s mean: I did not utter the "notorious " sentence , and that Mar x "lyingl y added " it? Certainl y not.
The eight Londo n morning paper s of April 17, 1863 would unanimousl y give the lie to such a claim.
They prove beyon d all doubt that this sentenc e was spoken .
If Mr.
Gladston e made no change s in the Hansar d report—although I am twelve years younge r than him, I would not like to rely so implicitl y on my memor y in such trivialitie s which occurre d 27 years ago—the n the omissio n of the sentenc e in Hansar d says nothin g in Mr.
Brentano' s favour , and a great deal agains t Hansard .
Aside fro m this one point about the "lyingl y added " sentence , Mr.
Gladstone' s opinio n is completel y inconsequentia l here.
For as soon as we disregar d this point, we find ourselve s exclusivel y in the field of inconsequentia l opinions , in which after years of strife each stick s to his guns.
If Mr.
Gladstone , should he happen to be quoted, prefer s the quotatio n method s of Mr.
Brentano , an admiring supporter , to those of Marx, a sharply critical opponent , then thi s is quite obvious , and his indisputabl e right.
For us, however, an d for the questio n as to whethe r Marx quoted in good or in bad faith, his opinio n is not even worth as much as that of any old uninvolve d third person .
For here Mr.
Gladston e is no longer a witness but an intereste d party.

VII In conclusion , let us go briefly into the questio n of what Mr.
Gladston e said in that—thank s to Mr.
Brentano , now "notori -ous"— passage of his budge t speech of 1863, and what Marx quoted o f what he said, or else what he "lyingl y added " or "suppressed".
I n order to oblige Mr.
Brentan o as far as possible , let us take as our basis the immaculat e Hansard , and in his own translation.
3 "In ten years from 1842 to 1852 inclusive , the taxabl e incom e of the country, a s nearly as we can make out, increase d by 6 per cent; but in eight years, from 185 3 to 1861, the income of the countr y again increase d upon the basis taken by 20 per cent.
That is a fact so singula r and strikin g as to seem almos t incredible.
" Mr.
Brentan o himself ha s nothin g agains t Marx's quotatio n of this sentence , apart from the fact that it is allegedl y taken from The Theory of the Exchanges.
Bu t of Brentano' s quotatio n it must be said here that it too is far remove d from giving "the real budget speech".
H e excise s Mr.
Gladstone' s followin g excursu s on the causes o f this astonishin g augmentatio n withou t even indicatin g the omissio n with dots.
— Further : "Such, Sir , is the state of the case as regard s the genera l progres s of accumulation; but , for one, I must say that I should look with some degree of pain, and with much apprehension , upon this extraordinar y and almos t intoxicatin g growth, i f it were my belief that it is confine d to the class of person s who may be described a s in easy circumstances .
The figures which I have quoted take little or no cognizanc e of the conditio n of those who do not pay incom e tax; or, in other words, sufficientl y accurat e for genera l truth, they do not take cognizanc e of the property o f the labourin g population , or of the increas e of its income.
" There no w follow s the sentenc e which accordin g to Mr.
Bren -tano was "lyingl y added " by Marx, but which on the testimon y of all eight mornin g paper s of April 17 was certainl y uttere d by Mr.
Gladstone : "The augmentatio n I have described , and which is founded , I think, upon accurate returns , is an augmentatio n entirel y confine d to classes of property.
" (The Times, The Morning Star, The Morning Advertiser, Daily Telegraph.
) ".
.
.
i s entirel y confined t o the augmentatio n of capital" .
(Morning Herald, Standard, The Daily News, Morning Post.
) After th e word "income" , Hansar d immediatel y continue s with the words : "Indirectly, indeed , the mere augmentation of capital i s of the utmost advantag e to the labourin g class, because that augmentatio n cheapen s the commodit y which in the whol e busines s of productio n comes into direct competitio n with labour.
" a Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, Vol .
CLXX, pp.
244-45.
— Ed, Although Hansar d omits the "notorious " sentence , it says in substance jus t what the other paper s say: it would be very embarrassing fo r the speake r if this intoxicatin g augmentatio n were confined t o CLASSE S IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES , but althoug h it pains him, this augmentatio n he has describe d is confine d to people who do not belon g to the workin g class and who are rich enoug h to pay income tax ; yes, it is indeed a "mere augmentatio n of capital" ! And here , finally , the secret of Mr.
Brentano' s fury stand s revealed.
H e reads the sentenc e in the Inaugura l Address , finds in it an embarrassin g admission , obtains the Hansar d version , fails to find the embarrassin g sentenc e in it, and hurrie s to publish to the world: Mar x lyingl y added the sentenc e in form and in content! — Marx shows him the sentenc e in The Times, The Morning Star, The Morning Advertiser.
No w finally , for appearance' s sake at least, Mr.
Brentan o must mak e a "detaile d compariso n of texts" and discovers—what ? That The Times, The Morning Star, The Morning Advertiser "full y coincid e materially " with Hansard ! Unfortunately h e overlook s the fact that the "lyingl y added " sentence mus t then fully coincid e materiall y with Hansard , and that then in the end it must turn out that Hansar d coincide s materiall y with the Inaugura l Address .
The whol e hullabalo o therefor e becaus e Mr.
Brentan o had neglected t o undertak e the detaile d textual compariso n ascribe d to him by Mr.
Sedley Taylor , and because , in fact, he had himsel f not understoo d what Mr.
Gladston e had said accordin g to Hansard.
O f course , this was not that easy, for althoug h Mr.
Brentan o claims tha t this speech "aroused th e interes t and admiratio n of the entire educate d world .
.
.
notably through .
.
.
its claritv" , readers hav e been able to see for themselve s that in the Hansar d version it is presente d in a particularl y stilted , complicate d and involved language , tying itself up in its own repetitions .
In particular th e sentenc e stating that the increas e in capital is of extraordinary advantag e to the worker , becaus e it cheapen s the commodity whic h in the busines s of productio n comes into direct competition with labour, i s sheer nonsense .
If a commodit y comes into competition wit h labour , and this commodit y (for example , machinery) i s cheapened , then the first and immediat e result is a fall in wages, and accordin g to Mr.
Gladston e this should be "of great benefi t to the workers" ! How philanthropi c it was of some London mornin g papers , i.
e.
The Morning Star, i n their "necessar -ily bungling " reports , to replac e the above incomprehensibl e sentence b y what Mr.
Gladston e probabl y wanted t o say, namely that an increas e in capital is of benefit to the worker s becaus e it cheapens th e main article s of consumption ! When Mr .
Gladston e said that he should look with some degree of pain and much apprehensio n at this intoxicatin g growth if he believed tha t it was confine d to classes in easy circumstances — whether Mr .
Gladston e thought thereb y of anothe r growt h of wealth tha n that of which he spoke, namely , in his opinion , of the greatly improve d situatio n of the entire nation; whethe r he forgot a t that momen t that he was speakin g of the increas e in income of the classes tha t pay income tax and of no others: this we cannot know.
Marx ha s been charge d with forgery , and what is at issue is the text and the grammatica l meanin g of what Mr.
Gladston e said, and not what he possibl y wanted t o say.
Mr.
Brentan o does not know the latter either , and on this point Mr.
Gladstone , 27 years later, is no longe r a competen t authority .
And in no way does this concern us .
The abundantl y clear meanin g of the words is: taxable incom e has undergon e an intoxicatin g augmentation .
I should be very sorry if this augmentatio n just describe d were confine d to classes of property , but it is confine d to them, since the worker s have no income liabl e to tax, and it is thus purely an increas e in capital ! But the latter, too, is of advantag e to the workers , because they, etc.
And now Marx : "This intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power .
.
.
is entirely confine d to classes o f property.
" 3 Thus run s the sentenc e in the Inaugura l Address , where it provided th e occasio n for this whole jolly controversy .
But since Mr.
Brentan o has no longer dared to claim that Marx lyingly added it , since then the Inaugura l Addres s has no longer been mentioned a t all, and all attacks have been directe d agains t the quotation o f this passag e in Capital.
Ther e Marx adds the following sentence : "but.
.
.
bu t it must be of indirec t benefit to the labourin g population , because it cheapens th e commoditie s of genera l consumption.
" The "arbitraril y thrown-togethe r mosaic of sentence s torn from their context " in Marx thus states "materially" , "only formall y more contracted", exactl y what the immaculat e Hansar d has Gladston e say.
The only reproac h which can be levelle d at Marx is that a See this volume , p.
173.
— Ed.
125 he utilise d The Morning Star an d not Hansard , and thus, in the final sentence , placed words of sense in Mr.
Gladstone' s mouth, althoug h he had spoken nonsense .
Further , accordin g to Hansard3: "But, beside s this, a more direct and a larger benefit has, it may safely be asserted, bee n conferre d upon the mass of the people [of the country] .
It is a matter o f profoun d and inestimabl e consolatio n to reflect, that while the rich have been growin g richer , the poor have becom e less poor.
I will not presum e to determine whethe r the wide interva l which separate s the extreme s of wealth and poverty i s less or more wide than it has been in forme r times.
" In Marx : ".
.
.
while th e rich have been growin g richer, the poor have been growin g less poor.
At any rate, whethe r the extreme s of povert y are less, I do not presum e to say.
" Marx give s only the two rare positiv e statement s which , in Hansard, swi m in a whole tureen of phrase s as trivial as they are unctuous.
I t can be stated with certaint y that they lose nothin g thereby, bu t rather gain.
Finally th e conclusion , accordin g to Hansard : "But if we look to the averag e conditio n of the British labourer , whethe r peasant, o r miner, or operative , or artisan , we know from varied and indubitabl e evidence tha t during the last twenty years such an additio n has been made to his means o f subsistenc e as we may almost pronounc e to be withou t exampl e in the history o f any countr y and of any age.
" This sentenc e is quoted in the Inaugura l Addres s a few lines above th e "notorious " one just given.
There we find: "Such ar e the officia l statement s publishe d by order of Parliament i n 1864, during the millenniu m of free trade, at a time when th e Chancello r of the Excheque r told the Hous e of Commons that : 'The averag e conditio n of the British laboure r has improve d in a degree we know to be extraordinar y and unexample d in the history of any countr y or any age.
'" b Thus everythin g essentia l is cited.
But that this may be read in the Inaugura l Address , origina l edition , p.
4, this fact is stubborn -ly conceale d from his reader s by Mr.
Brentano ; however, hi s readers canno t check upon him, for we cannot possibl y presen t each of them with a copy of the Address , as we did Mr.

had to defen d the Inaugura l Address , since up to then Mr.
Brentan o had not got the passag e in Capital int o his naggin g range.
An d in his followin g rejoinde r (Documents , No.
7a) Mr.
Brentano' s attack is still directed against the Inaugura l Addres s and Marx' s defenc e of this.
It is only after Marx's death that a new turn comes, and this not through Mr.
Brentan o but throug h his Cambridg e shield-bearer .
Only no w is it discovere d that in Capital Mar x suppresse d the resonant declaration s made by Mr.
Gladston e about the unexam -pled improvemen t in the conditio n of the British worker , and that this converte d Mr.
Gladstone' s meanin g into the contrary .
And her e we have to say that Marx missed the opportunit y for a brilliant burs t of rhetoric .
The whole section in the introductio n to which thi s speech by Gladston e is quoted has the purpos e of furnishing evidenc e that the conditio n of the great majorit y of the British workin g class was straitene d and unworthy , just at the time of this intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth .
What a magnificen t contrast Gladstone' s selfsam e pompou s words about the happy condition o f the British workin g class, [a condition ] unexample d in the histor y of any countr y and any age, would have provide d to this evidenc e of mass poverty , drawn from the official publication s of Parliamen t itself! But if Marx wished to refrain from such a rhetorica l effect, he had no reason to quote these words of Gladstone's .
Firstly, they are nothin g but the standar d phrase s which every Britis h Chancellor o f the Excheque r believe s it to be his moral duty to repeat in good or even in tolerabl e busines s periods ; they are thus meaningless.
An d secondly , Gladston e himsel f retracte d them within a year; in his next budget speech of April 7, 1864, at a time of even greate r industria l prosperity , he spoke of masses "on the border o f pauperism" , and of branche s of busines s "in which wages hav e not increased" , and proclaimed—accordin g to Hansard : "Again, an d yet more at large, what is human life, but, in the great majorit y of cases, a struggle for existence? " * * And here some more from this speech , accordin g to Hansard : the numbe r of paupers ha d fallen to 840,000 .
"That amount , however , does not include person s who are dependen t upon charitabl e establishments ; or who are relieve d by private almsgiving.
.
.
.
But , beside s all those whom it comprises , think of those who are on the border s of that region, think how many of the labourin g classes are strugglin g manfully bu t with difficult y to maintai n themselve s in a position above the place of a See this volume , pp.
152-54.
— Ed.
But Mar x quote s this other budge t speech of Gladstone' s immediately afte r that of 1863, and if Mr.
Gladston e himself, on April 7, 1864, declared that the unexample d blessing s were non-existent, thos e blessing s for the existenc e of which he had possessed "varie d and indubitabl e evidence" , then for Marx there was no longer the slightest shadow of a reason to quote these vivacious protestations , which were unfortunatel y ephemeral , even for Mr.
Gladstone .
He could conten t himsel f with the speaker' s admissions tha t while the incomes of 150 pound s sterling and over had augmente d intoxicatingly , the poor had in any case becom e less poor , and that the interval betwee n extrem e wealth and extreme povert y had scarcely been reduced .
We shal l not commen t on the fact that it is the habit of the official Germa n economist s to quote Marx in sentence s torn from context.
If he had created a hullabalo o in every such case, as Mr.
Brentan o has done here, he would never have been finished .
But now let us examine more closely the unexample d augmenta -tion of the means of subsistenc e enjoye d at that time by the British labourer, peasan t or miner, artisan or operative .
The peasant is in England and the greater part of Scotland only an agricultura l day labourer .
In 1861 there were a total of 1,098,261 such peasants , of whom 204,96 2 lived as farmhand s on tenant farms.
* From 1849 to 1859 his money wage had increase d by 1 shilling, in a few cases by 2 shillings a week, but in the final analysis thi s was mostly only a nomina l increase .
His position in 1863, the really abject housin g condition s under which he lived, are describe d by Dr.
Hunter (Public Health , VII Report, 1864): "The cost s occasione d by the agricultura l laboure r are fixed at the lowest figure at which he can live.
" paupers.
" In the congregatio n of a clergyma n in the East End of London , 12,000 out of 13,000 souls were always on the verge of actual want; a well-know n philanthropist ha d declare d that there were whole district s in the Eas t End of London in which you cannot find an omnibus or a cab, in which there is no street music, nor even a street beggar.
.
.
The means to wage the struggl e for existence were, however , somewhat better than previously (!) .
.
.
In many places wages had increased , but in many others the y had not, etc.
And this jeremia d came just one year after the pompou s announcement of the "unexampled " improvement ! * The figures are taken partly from the census of 1861, partly from the report of the CHILDREN' S EMPLOYMEN T COMMISSION , 1863-1867.
a a Census of England and Wales for the year 1861, London, 1863; Children's Employment Commission (1862), Report {I-VI) of the Commissioners, London , 1863.
— Ed According to the same report , the food intake of a part of the day labourers ' familie s (particularl y in eight named counties ) was below the absolute minimu m necessar y to avert starvatio n diseases .
And Professo r Thorol d Rogers , a political supporte r of Gladstone , declared in 1866 (A History of Agriculture and Prices) tha t the agricultural day laboure r had once again becom e a serf, and, as he demonstrated at length, a poorly fed and poorly house d serf, much wors e off than his ancesto r at the time of Arthur Young (1770 to 1780), and incomparabl y worse than the day laboure r in the 14th and 15th centuries .
So Gladston e had no luck at all with the "peasants" .
But how about the "miner" ? On this we have the parliamentar y report of 1866.
a In 1861, 565,875 miners were workin g in the United Kingdom , 246,61 3 of them in coal mines.
In the latter the wages of the men had risen slightly , and they mostly did an eight-hour shift , while the youngster s had to work 14 to 15 hours.
Mine inspectio n was just a farce: there were 12 inspector s for 3,217 mines ! The result was that the lives of the miners were sacrificed wholesal e in largely avoidabl e explosions ; the mine-owners compensate d themselve s in general for the small wage increases by wage deduction s based on false weight s and measures .
In the ore mines , accordin g to the report of the ROYAL COMMISSIO N of 1864, condition s were still worse.
But the "artisan" ? Let us take the metalworkers , altogethe r 396,998.
Of these, some 70,000 to 80,000 were machin e fitters, and thei r situatio n was in fact good, thanks to the toughnes s of their old, strong and rich trade association .
For the other metalworkers too, provide d full physica l strengt h and skill were called for, a certain improvemen t had taken place, as was natural with busines s having again becom e better since 1859 and 1860.
In contrast, the situatio n of the women and children also employe d (10,000 wome n and 30,000 under 18 in Birmingha m and district alone) was miserabl e enough , and that of the nail makers (26,130 ) and chai n maker s miserabl e in the extreme .
In the textile industry , the 456,646 cotton spinner s and weavers , and with them 12,55 6 calico printers , are decisive .
And they must have bee n very surprise d to hear of this unexample d happiness — in April 1863, at the height of the cotton famin e and the American Civi l War, at the time (Octobe r 1862) when 60 per cent of the spindles and 58 per cent of the looms stood idle, and the a Report from the Select Committee on Mines.

remainder wer e only workin g 2-3 days a week; when over 50,000 cotton operatives , individuall y or with families , were supporte d by the Poor Law or the relief committe e and (in March 1863) 135,62 5 were employe d by the same committe e at starvatio n wages on public work s or in sewing schools ! (Watts, The Facts of the Cotton Famine, 1866 , p.
211.
)—Th e other textile operatives , particularl y in the wool and linen branches , were relativel y prosperous ; the lack of cotton increase d their employment .
The report s of the CHILDREN' S EMPLOYMEN T COMMISSIO N give us the best informatio n on how things looked in a number of smalle r branches o f business : hosiery—120,00 0 workers , of whom only 4,000 wer e protecte d by the Factory Act, amongs t the others many quite youn g children , colossall y overworked ; lace-makin g and dressing, mostl y cottage industry—o f 150,00 0 worker s only 10,000 protected b y the Factory Act, colossal overworkin g of childre n and girls; straw-plaitin g and straw-hat-making—40,000 , almos t all children, disgustingl y slave-driven ; finally the manufactur e of clothing an d shoes , employin g 370,21 8 femal e worker s for outerwear an d millinery , 380,71 6 ditto for underwea r and—i n England an d Wales alone—573,38 0 male workers , includin g 273,223 shoemaker s and 146,04 2 tailors, of whom betwee n Vs and V4 were under 20.
Of these 1 V4 million , a maximu m of 30 per cent of the men were passabl y off, workin g for private customers .
The res t were exposed , as in all the branche s of busines s mentioned i n this paragraph , to exploitatio n throug h middle men, factors, agents , SWEATER S as they are called in England , and this alon e describe s their lot: terribl e overwor k for a wretche d wage.
Things wer e no better with the "unexampled " fortun e of the workers i n paper-makin g (100,00 0 workers , half women) , pottery (29,000), hat-makin g (15,00 0 in Englan d alone) , the glass industr y (15,000), boo k printin g (35,000) , artificia l flower-makin g (11,000) , etc.
, etc.
In short , the CHILDREN' S EMPLOYMEN T COMMISSIO N demande d that no fewer tha n 1,400,00 0 women, young people and childre n should be place d under the protectio n of the Factor y Act, in order to guard the m from mostl y ruinou s overwork .
And finall y the numbe r of PAUPER S dependen t upon poor relief from publi c funds in 1863: 1,079,382 .
On this basis we may make an unofficia l list of those worker s unquestionably ver y badly off in 1863: agricultura l day labourer s in roun d figure s 1,100,000 ; cotton operative s 469,000 ; seam-stresses an d milliner s 751,000 ; tailors and shoemakers , after the deduction of 30%, 401,000 ; lace-maker s 150,000 ; paper-maker s 100,000; hosier y worker s 120,000 ; smalle r branche s investigate d by the CHILDREN' S EMPLOYMEN T COMMISSIO N 189,000 ; and finally PAUPERS 1,079,000.
Togethe r 4,549,00 0 workers , added to which, in some cases, their family members .
And 186 3 was a good busines s year.
The crisis of 1857 had been fully overcome , deman d was rising rapidly , with the exceptio n of the cotto n industr y nearly all branche s of business were very busy.
So wher e is the "unexampled " improvemen t to be found? The factor y legislatio n of the forties had decisivel y improve d the lot of those worker s subject to it.
But in 1863 this benefitte d only the worker s employe d in wool, linen and silk, altogethe r about 270,000, whil e the cotton operative s were starving .
For bleachin g workers and dye workers , legal protectio n existed only on paper.
Further: in branche s of work in which full male strengt h and sometimes dexterit y are indispensable , the resistanc e of the workers, organise d in trade associations , had forced throug h for themselves a share of the proceed s of the favourabl e busines s period, and it may be said that on the average for these branche s of work, involvin g heavy male labour , the living standar d of the workers had risen decisively , though it is still ridiculou s to describe this improvemen t as "unexampled" .
But while the great mass of productive wor k has been transferre d to machine s operate d by weaker men, by women and young workers , the politician s like to treat the strong men employe d in heavy work as the only workers , and to judge the whole workin g class accordin g to their standard .
Against the 4 1/2 millio n worse-of f worker s and PAUPERS detailed above, we have, as well-off, 270,000 textile worker s in wool, linen and silk.
Further we may assume that of the 376,000 metal worker s one third were well-off, one third middling , and only the last third, including the workers under 18, the nail-makers , chain-smiths , and women, wer e badly off.
We may classify the situation of the 566,00 0 miners as medium-good .
The situation of the building craftsme n may be considere d as good, apart from thos e in the cotton districts .
Amongs t the joiners, at most 1/$ were well-off, the great mas s worked for blood-suckin g SWEATERS .
Amongs t the railway employees ther e was already at that period colossa l overworking , which has only brough t about organise d resistanc e in the last 20 years.
In short, we may add together in total scarcely one million of whom we may say that their situatio n had improve d in relation to the improvemen t in the busines s and the profits of the capitalists; wha t remain s over is in a middlin g situation , has a few, on the whole insignificant , benefit s from the better busines s period, o r consist s of such a mixture of workin g people accordin g to sex and age that the improvement s for the men are offset by the overworkin g of the women and young workers .
And if this should not suffice , then one should consul t the "Reports o n PUBLI C HEALTH " which becam e necessar y precisel y because th e "unexampled " improvemen t for the workin g class in the 20 years up to 1863 showed itself as typhus , cholera and other jolly epidemics , which finally sprea d from the working-clas s quarters t o the gentee l areas of the cities.
Here the unexample d "augmentation o f the means of subsistence " of the British worke r is investigate d with respec t to housin g and food, and it is found that in many cases his dwellin g was simply a centre of infection , and his nourishmen t was on the borderline , or even beneat h the border a t which starvatio n disease s necessaril y occur.
This wa s the real conditio n of the British workin g class at the beginning o f 1863.
This was the face of the "unexampled " improvement fo r the workin g class of which Mr.
Gladston e boasted.
An d if Marx is to be blamed for anything , it is that he did Mr.
Gladston e an unearne d servic e by omittin g his braggin g statement.
Conclusion: Firstly , Marx "lyingl y added " nothing .
Secondly, h e "suppressed " nothin g about which Mr.
Gladston e might hav e a right to complain .
And thirdly , the octopus-lik e tenacit y with which Mr.
Brentan o and his companion s cling to this single quotatio n amongs t the many thousand s of quotation s in Marx's writing proves that they know onl y too well "how Karl Marx quotes"—namel y correctly .

11-1550 How lame an anti-climax ! If the working class has remained , "poor", only "less poor" in proportio n as it produce s for the wealthy class "an intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power", then it has remaine d relativel y just as poor.
If the extreme s of poverty have not lessened , they have increased , becaus e the extremes of wealth have.
As to the cheapenin g of the means of subsistence, the official statistics , e.

the account s of the LONDON ORPHAN ASYLUM , show an increase in price of 20% for the average of the three years 1860-1862 , compare d with 1851-1853 .
In the following three years, 1863-1865 , there was a progressiv e rise in the price of meat, butter, milk, sugar, salt, coals, and a number of other necessar y means of subsistence.
104' Gladstone' s next budget speech of April 7th, 1864, is a Pindari c dithyrambu s on the advance of surplus-value-makin g and the happines s of the people "tempered by poverty" .
He speaks of masses "on the border of pauperism", of branche s of trade in which "wage s have not increased", and finally sums up the happines s of the working-clas s in the words: "huma n life is but, in nine cases out of ten, a struggle for existence".
105' Professo r Fawcett , not bound like Gladstone by official considerations , declare s roundly : "I do not, of course, deny that money wages have been augmente d by this increase of capital" (in the last ten years), "but this apparen t advantag e is to a great extent lost , becaus e many of the necessarie s of life are becomin g dearer " (he believes becaus e of the fall in value of the preciou s metals ) ".

10, MARC H 7, 1872 How Karl Marx Quotes The followin g passag e may be found in the Inaugura l Address * of the International Workin g Men's Associatio n writte n by Karl Marx.
"Dazzled b y the 'Progres s of the Nation ' statistic s dancin g before his eyes, the Chancellor o f the Excheque r exclaim s in wild ecstasy : 'From 1842 to 1852 the taxable incom e of the countr y increase d by 6 per cent; in the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it has increase d from the basis taken in 1853,2 0 per cent! The fact is so astonishin g as to be almost incredible!.
.
.
This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power,' adds Mr.
Gladstone, 'is entirely confined to classes of property.
'" This quotatio n by Marx has becom e famous .
We have discovere d it in a considerable numbe r of writings .
However , the author s rarely quote d the Inaugural Addres s of the Internationa l as the source upon which they had drawn .
They inferre d that they had themselve s read Gladstone' s budget speech .
To what extent thi s was the case may be seen from the followin g compariso n with Gladstone's speec h (see Hansard , Parliamentary Debates, 3r d Series , Vol.
170, p.
243 ff.
): "The Incom e Tax, at Id.
in the pound , in the year 1842 3, attachin g to Great Britain only , and in Great Britain only to income s of £150 and upwards , was assessed upo n an aggregat e amoun t of incom e in the schedule s I have named reaching £156,000,000 .
Upon the very same area, with the same limitations , in 1860-1 th e amoun t of assesse d income was £221,000,000 .
Further , I am not aware that ther e has been any change in the machiner y of the tax, or any improvemen t in the power s of levying the tax, as compare d with the powers of escapin g it, that will in any way accoun t for the difference .
On the contrary , certain concession s and relaxations hav e from time to time been enacte d by the Legislature , which, as far as they go, would rather tell in the opposit e direction .
The difference , however , amounts t o no less than £65,000,00 0 of annual income , or two-seventh s of the whole annua l taxable incom e of the countr y within the area described .
That is a most remarkabl e result; but there is a certain feature of that result which, when carefully examined , is yet more remarkable ; and that is the accelerate d rate of increase i n the latter portio n of that period .
I again invite the attentio n of the Committee fo r a few minutes .
I compar e two periods—on e of them before 1853, and the other since 1853, the year when the basis was altered .
In ten years from * Reprinte d in the Volksstaat, No.

[Note by Brentano.
] 11* 1842 to 1852 inclusive , the liable to tax income of the country , as nearly as we can make out , increase d by 6 per cent; but in eight years, from 1853 to 1861, the income o f the countr y again increase d upon the basis taken by 20 per cent.
That is a fact so singula r and strikin g as to seem almos t incredible .
[.
.
.
] "Such, Sir , is the state of the case as regard s the genera l progres s of accumulation; but , for one, I must say that I should look with some degree of pain, and with much apprehension, upon this extraordinary and almost intoxicating growth, if it were my belief that it is confined to the class of persons who may be described as in easy circumstances.
Th e figures which I have quoted take little or no cognizanc e of the condition o f those who do not pay incom e tax; or, in other words, sufficientl y accurate fo r genera l truth, they do not take cognizanc e of the propert y of the labouring population , or of the increas e of its income .
Indirectly , indeed, the mere augmentation o f capital is of the utmost advantag e to the labourin g class, because that augmentatio n cheapen s the commodit y which in the whole busines s of production come s into direct competitio n with labour .
But, besides this, a more direct and a larger benefit has, it may safely be asserted, been conferred upon the mass of the people of the country.
It is matter of profound and inestimable consolation to reflect, that while the rich have been growing richer, the poor have become less poor.
I will not presum e to determine whethe r the wide interva l which separate s the extreme s of wealth and poverty i s less or more wide than it has been in former times.
But if we look to the average condition of the British labourer, whethe r peasant , or miner, or operative , or artisan, we know from varied and indubitable evidence that during the last twenty years such an addition has been made to his means of subsistence as we may almost pronounce to be without example in the history of any country and of any age.
" What is the relationshi p betwee n this speech and the quotatio n by Marx? Gladstone firs t makes the point that there has undoubtedl y been a colossal increas e in the incom e of the country .
This is proved for him by the incom e tax.
But income ta x takes notice only of income s of 150 pound s sterling and over.
Person s with lowe r income s pay no incom e tax in England .
The fact that Gladston e mentions thi s so that his yardstic k can be properl y appreciate d is utilised by Marx to have Gladston e say: " This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property.
" Ye t this sentenc e is nowher e to be found in Gladstone's speech .
It says quite the opposite .
Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content ! No.

— Ed b W.
Liebknecht.
— Ed Gladstone's budge t speech of April 16, 1863, which is not contained i n Hansard' s semi-officia l repor t of parliamentar y debates.
O n this basis, with comfortabl e manufacturers ' logic the Concordia concludes : "This sentenc e is nowher e to be found in Gladstone's speech" , and jubilate s in the fullnes s of its heart with this mockin g sentenc e in manufacturers ' German , printe d in mocking bol d face: "Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content!" It would , in fact, be extremel y strang e if the Inaugura l Address , originally printe d in Englis h in Londo n under Gladstone' s very eyes, had placed in his mouth a sentenc e interpolate d by me, a sentence that , for seven and a half years, circulate d unchallenge d in the Londo n press, to be finally detecte d by the "learne d men" of the Germa n Manufacturers ' Associatio n in Berlin .
The sentenc e in questio n of the Inaugura l Addres s reads as follows: * "This intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and powe r is entirely confine d to classes of property " (p.
6, Inaugura l Addres s etc.
).
* (In the Germa n translatio n literally: a) In an article in The Fortnightly Review (Novembe r 1870), which attracted grea t attentio n and was discusse d by all the Londo n press, Mr.
Beesly, Professo r of Histor y at the universit y here, quoted a s follows , p.

" * (In the Germa n translation: 3) That is, word for word, exactly what I quoted.
This prove s irrefutabl y that the Germa n Manufacturers ' Associa -a Furthe r there follows the Germa n translatio n of the sentence.
— Ed tion "lied both in form and in content" in decrying this "sentence " as a fabricatio n "by me"! Incidentally: hones t old Concordia printe d in bold face anothe r passage, in which Gladston e prattle d about an elevatio n of the English workin g class, over the last 20 years, that was supposedl y "extraordinary and unparallele d in all countrie s and in all periods".
The bold-fac e type is suppose d to indicate that I had suppressed thi s passage .
On the contrary ! In the Inaugura l Address I emphasise d most strongl y the screamin g contras t between thi s shameles s phrase and the "APPALLIN G STATISTICS" , as Professor Beesl y rightl y calls them, containe d in the official English report s on the same period.
* The autho r of The Theory of the Exchanges0 quoted , like myself, not from Hansard , but from a London newspape r which, on April 17 , publishe d the April 16 budget speech .
In my collectane a of cutting s for 1863, I have searche d in vain for the relevant extract and thus, also, for the name of the newspape r that published it.
This is, however , not important .
Althoug h the parliamentary report s of the London newspaper s always differ from one another , I was certain that none of them could completely suppres s such a striking quotatio n from Gladstone .
So I consulte d The Times of April 17, 1863 — it was then, as now, Gladstone's organ—an d there I found, on p.
7, column 5, in the report on the budget speech : * "That is the state of the case as regards the wealth of this country.
I must say for one, I should look almost with apprehensio n and with pain upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, if it were my belief that it was confine d to classes who are in easy circumstances.
** Thi s takes no cognizanc e at all of the conditio n of the labourin g population .

27, JULY 4, 1872 HOW KARL MARX DEFENDS HIMSELF I Our reader s will perhap s recall the article "How Karl Marx Quotes " in No.
10 of this paper on March 7 this year.
In it we dealt with a passage from the Inaugural Addres s of the International , written by Karl Marx, a passage which has won a certain fame and is frequentl y quoted by the Social Democrat s as convincin g proof of the irrevocabl e ruin of the workin g class should the state and social conditions o f today persist .
Here Marx quote s Gladstone' s budge t speech of April 16 , 1863.
In this speech Gladston e first notes that there has been "an extraordinary an d almost intoxicatin g growth " of the income of the country , and he uses the increas e in incom e tax [revenue ] to prove this.
But the figures he quotes fo r this purpos e "take little or no cognizanc e of the conditio n of those who do not pay incom e tax"; they "do not take cognizanc e of the propert y of the labouring population , or of the increas e of its income" .
Person s with an incom e under 15 0 pound s sterling , in fact, pay no incom e tax in England .
And the fact that Gladston e had mentione d this to allow a proper appreciatio n of his yardstic k was utilise d by Marx in order to have Gladston e say: "This intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power is entirel y confine d to classes of property.
" However, thi s sentenc e is nowher e to be found in Gladstone' s speech .
On the contrary, Gladston e said that he did not believ e this augmentatio n "had been confined t o the class of person s who may be describe d as in easy circumstances" .
And indignan t at the impudenc e with which Marx quote d distortingly , we exclaimed: "Mar x has added the sentenc e lyingly , both in form and in content! " This was a serious charge ; combine d with the convincin g evidenc e provided , it was absolutel y devastatin g for the widesprea d trust amongs t our Social Democrat s in the unparallele d and thoroug h learnedness , truthfulnes s and infallibilit y of the London oracle .
It could therefor e not be allowed to pass withou t a refutation , or at least somethin g which looked like a refutation .
In numbe r 44 of the Volksstaat dated Jun e 1,* Marx attempte d to give such a refutation.
3 But our opponen t has * That is almost a full three month s after the article appeare d in the Concordia.
Despite this , the Volksstaat wa s impudent enoug h scarcel y 14 days after carryin g a See this volume , pp.
136-40.
— Ed by no means been able to wash himsel f clean of the charge of mala fides i n his quotations.
I n fact, the ways and means of his defenc e are more suitabl e thnn anything t o prove his mala fides.
Th e brazenness , namely , with which he once again abuses th e fact that the reader s of the Volksstaat have no possibilit y of checkin g his claims, thi s brazennes s even exceed s his frivolit y in quotation .
Marx naturall y does not go so far as to challeng e the correctnes s of our quotation fro m the shorthan d report of Parliament .
His immediat e aim is to prove his bona fides i n quotation , and to this end he refers to the fact that others have quoted lik e he did.
He writes : "In an article in The Fortnightly Review (Novembe r 1870), a which attracte d great attention an d was discusse d by all the Londo n press, Mr.
Beesly, Professo r of History a t the universit y here, quoted as follows , p.
518: 'An intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power, as Mr.
Gladston e observed , entirely confine d to classes o f property.
'—Ye t Professo r Beesly' s article appeare d six years later than the Inaugura l Address! " Quite right ! Only the additio n of anothe r "yet" has been forgotten .
This article by Professo r Beesly deals, in fact, with the history of the International , and as the author himsel f inform s every enquirer , was writte n on the basis of materia l provided hi m by Marx.
And there is still more.
At this point it is not Beesly who is quoting Gladston e at all; he is merely saying that the Inaugura l Addres s of the International contain s this quotation .
"From this alarmin g statistics, " Beesly writes, "the Address turn s to the income-ta x returns , which show that the taxable income s of the countr y have increase d by 20% in eight years, 'an intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealt h and power' , as Mr.
Gladston e observed , entirely confined " etc.
— A fine way of proof indeed ! You trick some person who does not know your dishonest y into acceptin g a lying statement ; this person repeat s it in good faith; and then you cite this and the honest y of the person who repeate d the statemen t in order to prove th e correctnes s of the statemen t and your own honesty.
— Marx continue s his defence: "Let us now take a specialise d publication , intende d solely for the City and published no t only before the appearanc e of the Inaugura l Address , but even before Internationa l Workin g Men's Associatio n was founded .

The autho r of The Theory of the Exchanges,"b Mar x then continued , "quoted , like myself, not from Hansard , but Marx's rebutta l to accuse us of "heroicall y silencing " this rebuttal .
We believe that the Volksstaat had no reason to press so hard for the second , and sharper , treatment o f its lord and master .
Incidentally , the reason for the delay in our reply is partly due to the fact that one of the source s cited by Marx was not availabl e here and had to be obtaine d from England , partly to the fact that the elucidatio n of this quotatio n demande d length y extract s from the relevan t source s and consequently th e above article becam e unusuall y long, so that, for reasons of space, we wer e oblige d to postpon e publicatio n severa l times.

from a London newspape r which, on April 17, publishe d the April 16 budge t speech.
" And in fact the author of this book, which incidentall y is a vulgar diatribe , quoted fro m Hansar d just as little as did Marx.
But Marx, as we shall soon show, also did not even quote from a London newspaper .
First, however , it must be noted her e that when we stated that Marx had lyingly added the sentenc e in question t o Gladstone' s speech , we did not claim, either "in form or in content" , that he himsel f had also fabricate d it.
This would only be the case if Marx himsel f had bee n the fabricato r of that still very obscur e book, though one might be tempted t o believe this on accoun t of the ghastly style in which it is written .
The source fro m which Marx quotes this sentenc e is actually this book itself, and this is also the reason why, as he claims in his "collectane a of cutting s for 1863", he has "searched i n vain for the relevan t extract and thus, also, for the name of the newspaper tha t publishe d it"! This origin of Marx's quotatio n is shown clearly by a comparison o f the passag e in Capital, hi s book in which Marx review s Gladstone' s budget speech , and The Theory of the Exchanges.
There , on p.
639, particularl y in Note 103, a this speech is quoted in the absolutel y senseles s version given verbati m by that book on p.
134.
And the glosses too, which Marx bases on the contradictio n contained i n this version , are already containe d in that book, in particula r also the quotation fro m Molière given in Note 105 on p.
640 of Capital; an d in the same way the statemen t of the LONDO N ORPHA N ASYLU M about the rising prices of foodstuffs quote d by Marx appear s on p.
135 of that book, though Marx bases his claim fo r its correctnes s not on that book, but on that book's sources (see Capital, p.
640, Note 104).
c Now we ask; does anyone tell a lie only when he himself invents an untruth , or does he not tell a lie quite as much when he repeats it contrar y to what he knows, or is bound to know better ? We believe that the answe r is beyond doubt.
And secondly, whe n Marx repeate d the untrut h containe d in The Theory of the Exchanges, did he not do this contrar y to his better knowledge , or should he at least not have known better ? The answer here is also simple .
The first rule for any interpretation , a rule undoubtedl y known to Mr.
Marx, is to interpre t passage s which at first glance contai n contradictions—an d thus make no sense—i n such a way that the contradiction disappears ; and if the availabl e text appear s to make this impossible , one shoul d make a textual criticis m rathe r than believ e in the presenc e of a contradiction.
An d this was all the more imperativ e in the case of a speech which aroused th e interes t and admiratio n of the entire educate d world, notably throug h its master y of the materia l and its clarity.
And finally it was an act of frivolit y bordering upo n the crimina l to act in any other way than scrupulousl y when intending t o tear out of contex t a passage which provide s one half of the contradiction i n this version and to cast it as a denunciatio n of the propertie d amongst th e propertyles s all over the world.
Karl Marx should have taken umbrag e at this version if only on the basis of genera l learning , science and conscientious -ness; and the crimina l frivolit y with which he accept s this lying quotatio n is completely inexcusabl e in his case, since the full text of Gladstone' s speech was available t o him.
On the one hand, the English newspaper s reproduce d this speech the day after it was delivered , and, if not true to the word, then true to the sense.
And then , immediatel y after the deliver y of the speech , Gladston e publishe d it verbatim i n his book Financial Statements, London , 1863, which attracte d great a See this volume , p.

attention; an d on p.
403 of that book the speech is printed just as we quoted it.
Finally, Mar x could refer to the shorthan d repor t of this speech in Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, an d it is the custom to always quote a speech to Parliamen t from the shorthan d report , even if it contain s no contradiction s to the necessaril y bungling newspape r reports .
But here we come, to be sure, to Marx's third line of defence , and this far exceeds, i n its impuden t mendacity , anythin g which came before .
Marx actuall y does no t shrink from citing The Times o f April 17, 1863 as proof of the correctness o f his quotation .

7, col.
5, line I7ff, reports, however , the speech as follows : "That is the state of the case as regard s the wealth of this country .
I must say for one, I should look almost with apprehension and with pain upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, if it were my belief that it was confined to classes finding themselves in pleasant circumstances.
Thi s takes no cognizance a t all of the conditio n of the labourin g population .
The augmentatio n I have described , and the figures of which are based, I think, upon accurate returns,* i s entirely confine d to classes of property.
" (Marx quotes The Times t o this point; we quote further.
) "Now , the augmentatio n of capital is of indirec t benefit to the labourer, becaus e it cheapen s the commodit y which in the busines s of productio n comes int o direct competitio n with labour .
(Hear, hearl) Bu t we have this profound, and , I must say, inestimabl e consolation , that, while the rich have been growing richer , the poor have been growin g less poor.
—Whethe r the extreme s of poverty ar e less extrem e than they were I do not presum e to say, but the average condition of the British labourer, we have the happiness to know, has improved during the last 20 years in a degree which we know to be extraordinary, and which we may almost pronounce to be unexampled in the history of any country and of any age.
(Cheers.
)" A compariso n of this Times repor t with the report after Hansar d in the Concordia o f March 7 will show that both report s fully coincid e materially .
The report i n The Times jus t gives, formall y more contracted , what the shorthan d report b y Hansar d gives verbatim .
Yet despite the fact that the Times repor t contains th e direct opposit e of that notoriou s passag e in the Inaugura l Address , and the fact that accordin g to the Times report , too, Mr.
Gladston e said he believed thi s intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power not to be confine d to classes in easy circumstances , Marx has the impudenc e to write in the Volksstaat of June 1: "So, on April 16, 1863, Mr.
Gladston e declare d 'both in form and in content ' that 'this intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power is entirely confine d to the classes possesse d of property'.
" But even more.
Since we had alread y presente d to the public the complet e text of the speech from Hansard , and this text completel y exclude d the possibilit y of any distortion , an attemp t is made to delete this very embarrassin g circumstanc e with the phrase in the Hansar d "edition , here botchil y corrected , Mr.
Gladston e * In his Germa n quotatio n in the Volksstaat Mar x omits thi s relative clause and instead inserts : "which he" (Gladstone ) "had just describe d as 'this intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power'.
" This omissio n and this insertio n too are designed t o mislea d the reader about the sense of Gladstone' s words.
The omitte d relative claus e and in additio n the genera l contex t show that the sense of the speech is as follows : The augmentatio n of wealth shown by the income tax return s is certainl y confine d to the classes of propert y (since this tax is only impose d upon persons wit h an incom e of 150 pound s sterlin g and over), but with regard to the labouring class , we know, etc.
[Note by Brentano.
] was brigh t enoug h clumsil y to excise the passag e that would be, after all, compromising o n the lips of an Englis h Chancello r of the Exchequer" ! All that is lacking i s the claim that Gladston e probabl y did this in deferenc e to the diatrib e The Theory of the Exchanges, whic h did not appear until 1864! What ca n one say about such methods ? First we are presented , on the basis of an obscur e diatribe , with a quotatio n which was completel y forged , and the contradictory substanc e #of whic h prove d that it was forged , even withou t confronting i t with the original .
Called to accoun t in this matter , Marx states that others quote d in the same way as he did, and refers to people whom he himsel f fooled wit h this lie.
Even more: from the fact that his fuzzy source s accord with him, he tries to fashion an argumen t to excuse himself and show the correctnes s of his quotation , as though both of them had drawn upon a joint, correct , third source, thoug h in fact one had only copied from the other.
And finally he has the impudence t o base himsel f on newspape r report s which directl y contradic t him.
Indeed, t o describ e these practice s we know only one word, a word with which Marx himsel f is very familia r (see Capital, p .
257): they are simply "nefarious" .
Marx close s his defenc e with these words: "The irksom e subsequen t events will perhaps teac h the Manufacturin g Associate s that, howeve r well they may know how to forge goods, they are as well fitted to judge literary goods as a donkey is to play the lute.
" We confidentl y leave it to the reader to decide on which side the forgery and the irksomeness ultimatel y lie.
In a further article we shall explain to Mr.
Marx the importance whic h we attach to the conten t of Gladstone' s words.

MARX'S SECON D REPLY 3 DER VOLKSSTAAT, No.
63, AUGUS T 7, 1872 In the Concordia o f July 4, the Germa n Manufacturers ' Associa -tion attempte d to prove to me that its "learne d men" were as well fitted to judge literar y goods as the Associatio n was to forge commercial ones .
With referenc e to the passag e from Gladstone' s budget speech of April 16, 1863, as quoted in the Inaugura l Addres s of the International, th e manufacturers ' organ (No.
10) stated: "Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content.
" It thus declare s that I fabricate d the sentenc e in both form and content, wit h hair and bones.
Even more: it knows exactly how I did so.
The paper writes: "The fact that Gladston e mentione d a See presen t edition , Vol.
23, pp.
190-97.
— Ed.
» this, etc.
, was utilised by Marx in order to have Gladstone say, etc.
" By quoting th e sentenc e from a work publishe d before th e Inaugura l Address, The Theory of the Exchanges, I exposed the crude lie of the manufacturers' organ.
3 As the paper itself relates , it then ordere d from Londo n this work which it did not know, and convince d itself of the facts of the matter .
How could it lie itself out of the situation? Se e here: "When w e stated that Marx had lyingly added the sentenc e in questio n to Gladstone's speech , we did not claim, either in form or in content , that he himself had also fabricated it.
" Here we obviousl y have a case of equivocatio n peculia r to the mind of manufacturers .
For example , when a manufacturin g swindler, i n agreemen t with busines s colleagues , sends out into the world roll s of ribbon that contain , instead of the alleged three dozen ell s only two dozen, then he has in fact lyingly added on e dozen ells , precisel y becaus e he "has not fabricated' 1'' them.
Why, moreover, shoul d lyingly added sentence s not behave just like lyingly adde d ells? "The understanding s of the greate r part of men," say s Adam Smith , "are necessaril y formed by their ordinar y employments",15 th e understanding s of the manufacture r included .
Through th e Volksstaat, I extende d the erudite material s of the manufacturers' organ , not only with the quotatio n from The Theory of the Exchanges, bu t also with the pages from my work Capital concernin g Gladstone' s budge t speeches .
Now, from the material wit h which I provide d it, the paper attempt s to prove that I did not quote the dispute d passag e from a "Londo n news-paper", bu t from The Theory of the Exchanges.
Th e chain of arguments i s anothe r sample of manufacturers ' logic.
I told the manufacturers ' sheet that The Theory of the Exchanges quotes o n page 134 exactly as I quoted, and it discovers—tha t I quoted exactl y as The Theory of the Exchanges quote s on page 134.
And further ! "And th e glosses too, which Marx bases on the contradictio n containe d in this version, ar e alread y containe d in that book.
" This is simply a lie.
On page 639 of Capital, I give my glosses to the word s in Gladstone' s speech : "While th e rich have been growin g richer , the poor have been growin g less poor.
Whethe r the extreme s of povert y are less, I do not presum e to say.

My remar k on this is: "How lame an anti-climax ! If the working class has remaine d 'poor' , only 'less poor' in proportio n as it produces for the wealthy class 'an intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power', then it has remaine d relativel y just as poor.
If the extreme s of poverty have not lessened , they have increased , because the extreme s of wealth have.

"And the glosses too .

are already containe d in that book, in particular also the quotation fro m Molière given in Note 105 on p.

" 142 So, "in particula r also" I quote Molière, and leave it up to the "learned men" of the Concordia to detect and communicat e to the public the fact that the quotatio n comes from The Theory of the Exchanges.
In fact, however , I state expressl y in Note 105, p.
640 of Capital tha t the author of The Theory of the Exchanges b ''characterises with the following quotation from Molière'" the "continu -al crying contradiction s in Gladstone' s budge t speeches" .
Finally: ".

in the same way the statemen t of the LONDO N ORPHA N ASYLU M about the rising price s of foodstuff s quoted by Marx appear s on p.

640, Note 104)".
The Concordia advisedl y forgets to inform its readers that "that book" give s no sources.
Wha t was it trying to prove? That I took from tha t "book " a passage from Gladstone' s speech withou t knowing its source.
And how does the Concordia prov e it? By the fact that I really did take a quotatio n from that book, and checked it with the original sources , independen t of the book! Referring to my quotatio n from Professo r Beesly' s article in The Fortnightly Review (Novembe r 1870), the Concordia remarks .
"This articl e by Professo r Beesly deals, in fact, with the history of the International, and as the author himself inform s every enquirer , was written on the basis of materia l provide d him by Marx himself.
" Professor Beesl y states: "To no one is the success of the associatio n so much due as to Dr.
Karl Marx, who, in his acquaintanc e with the history and statistics of the industria l movemen t in all parts of Europe, is, I should imagine , withou t a rival.

All the materia l with which I supplied Professo r Beesly referre d exclusively t o the history of the International , and not a word concerned th e Inaugura l Address , which he had known since its publication.
Th e contex t in which his above remark stood left so little doub t on this point that The Saturday Review, i n a review of his article, 3 more than hinted that he himself wa s the author of the Inaugural Address.
* The Concordia assert s that Professo r Beesly did not quote the passage i n questio n from Gladstone' s speech , but only stated "that the Inaugural Address contained this quotation".
Le t us look into this.
Professor Beesl y states: "The addres s [.
.
.
] is probabl y the most striking and powerfu l statemen t of the workman's cas e as against the middle class that has ever been compresse d into a dozen smal l pages.
I wish I had space for copiou s extract s from it.
" After mentionin g the "frightfu l statistic s of the Blue Books", 143 to which the Addres s refers, he goes on: "From thes e appallin g statistic s the addres s passes on to the income-ta x returns , from whic h it appeare d that the taxable incom e of the countr y had increase d in eight year s twenty per cent, 'an intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power' , as Mr.
Gladstone observed, 'entirel y confine d to classes of property'.
" Professor Beesl y sets the words : "as Mr.
Gladstone observed" outside quotatio n marks , saying these words on his own behalf, and thus proves to the Concordia wit h the greates t clarity that he knows Gladstone' s budge t speech—solel y from the quotatio n in the Inaugura l Address ! As the Londo n busines s friend of the German Manufacturers ' Association , he is the only man who knows Gladstone' s budge t speeches , just as he, and he alone, knows: "Person s with an incom e under 150 pound s sterling , in fact, pay no incom e tax in England.
" (See the Concordia, Nos.
10 and 27.
) Yet English tax official s suffer from the idée fixe that this tax only stops at income s under 100 pound s sterling .
Referring t o the dispute d passag e in the Inaugura l Address , the manufacturers' pape r stated: " Yet this sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech.
" I proved th e contrar y with a quotatio n from the "Times" report o f April 17 , 1863.
I gave the quotatio n in the Volksstaat i n both English an d German , since a commentar y was necessar y on account o f Gladstone' s assertio n that he would "look almost with * Professo r Beesly drew my attention , in writing , to this quid pro quo.

apprehension an d with pain upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, i f it were" his "belief that it was confine d to the CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES".
Basing myself on Wakefield , I declared tha t the "CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES"—an expres -sion for which there is no Germa n equivalent—mean s the "really rich", "th e really prosperou s portion " of the propertie d classes .
Wakefield actuall y calls the real middle class "THE UNEASY CLASS", which is in Germa n roughl y "die ungemächliche Klasse".
* The manufacturers ' worthy organ not only suppresse s my exposition, i t ends the passag e I quoted with the words : "Marx quotes The Times t o this point" , thus leavin g the reade r to suppose tha t it had quoted from my translation ; in fact, however , the paper , leaving my version aside, does not translat e "CLASSE S WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES " as "wohlhabenden Klassen" 3 but as "Klassen, di e sich in angenehmen Verhältnissen befinden".
h The paper believe s its reader s capabl e of understandin g that not all sections o f the propertie d class are "prosperous" , though it will always b e a "pleasan t circumstance " for them to possess property .
Even in the translatio n of my quotation , as given by the Concordia, however, Gladston e describe s the progres s of capitalis t wealth as "this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power", an d remark s that here he has "taken no cognizance at all o f the conditio n of the labouring population" , closing with words to the effect that this "augmentation is entirely confined to the classes possessed of property".
Once th e "learne d man" of the Germa n Manufacturers ' Associa -tion has , in the report of The Times o f April 17, 1863, thus had Gladstone sa y "both in form and in content" , the same as I had him say in the Inaugura l Address , he strikes his swollen breast , brimming wit h conviction , and blusters : " Yet despite this .

trying t o make its reader s believ e I had suppresse d in the Inaugural Addres s Gladstone' s phrase s about the improvemen t in the conditio n of the British workin g class, though in fact the exact opposite wa s the case, and I stressed there with great emphasi s the glaring contradictio n betwee n this declamatio n and the officiall y established facts .
In its reply of July 4, the manufacturers ' paper repeated th e same manoeuvre .
"Marx quotes The Times t o this point," th e paper says, "we quote further.
" In confrontatio n with the paper , I needed only to quote the dispute d passage , but let us look for a momen t at the "further" .
After pourin g forth his panegyri c on the increas e of capitalis t wealth, Gladston e turns to the workin g class.
He takes good care not to say that it had shared in the ''intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power".
O n the contrary , he goes on, accordin g to The Times: "Now , the augmentation of capital is o f indirec t benefit to the labourer , etc.
" He consoles himsel f furthe r on with the fact "that whil e the rich have been growin g richer, th e poor have been growing less poor".
Finally , he asserts that he and his enriche d parliamentary friend s "have the happiness t o know" the opposit e of what parliamentar y enquirie s and statistica l data prove to be the fact, viz.
, "that the averag e conditio n of the British laboure r has improve d during the last 20 years in a degree which we know to be extraordinary , and which we may almost pronounce t o be unparallele d in the history of any countr y and of any age".
Before Mr .
Gladstone , all his predecessor s "had the happiness" t o supplement th e picture of the augmentatio n of capitalis t wealth in their budge t speeche s with self-satisfie d phrase s about the improvement i n the conditio n of the workin g class.
Yet he gives the lie to them all; for the millenniu m dates only from the passing of the Free Trade legislation .
The correctnes s or incorrectnes s of Gladstone's reason s for consolidatio n and congratulatio n is, however, a matter of indifferenc e here.
We are concerne d solely with this : that, from his standpoint , the pretende d "extraordi -nary" improvemen t in the conditio n of the workin g class in no way contradict s the "intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power tha t is entirel y confine d to the classe s possesse d of property".
O n the contrary .
It is the orthodo x doctrin e of the mouthpieces o f capital—Mr .
Gladston e being one of the best paid—that th e most infallibl e means for workin g men to benefit themselves is— to enrich thei r exploiters .
The shameles s stupidit y or stupid shamelessnes s of the manufac -turers' organ culminate s in its assurance : "The report in The 12-1550 Times jus t gives, formall y more contracted , what the shorthan d report b y Hansar d gives verbatim'' * Now let us see both reports : II From Gladstone's speech of April 16, 1863, printed by Han­ sard, Vol.

] is the state of the case as regards the genera l progres s of ac-cumulation; but, for one, I must say that I should look with some degree of pain, and with much apprehension , upon this extraordinary and almost intox­ icating growth, if it were my belief that it is confine d to THE CLASS OF PERSONS WHO MA Y BE DESCRIBE D AS IN EASY CIR-CUMSTANCES.
The figures which I have quoted tak e little or no cognizanc e of the conditio n of those who do not pay income tax; or, in other words , suffi-ciently accurat e for general truth (!), they do not take cognizanc e of the property (!) of the labourin g population , or (!) of the increas e of its income.
Indirectly, indeed , the mere augmenta -tion of capital is of the utmost advan-tage to the labourin g class, etc.

THE REJOINDE R OF ANONYMOU S CONCORDIA, No .
34, AUGUS T 22, 1872 More on the Character of Karl Marx On Augus t 7, in the Volksstaat, Kar l Marx replie d to the article "How Karl Marx Defends Himself " in No.
27 of the Concordia.
Astonishin g is the dogged mendacit y with whic h he clings to the distorte d quotatio n from Gladstone' s budget speech of April 16 , 1863, astonishin g even for someon e for whom no means are too base for his subversiv e plans.
In fact this can only be explaine d by the fear, which must be called fort h in the author , of the very embarrassin g effect of confessin g that this quotation, th e bombshel l of the Inaugura l Address , is false, given the great circulation o f the latter.
It will be recalle d that in his first defenc e Marx admitte d the shorthan d report of Gladstone' s speech in Hansar d did not contain this quotation .
But the reason was: Mr.
Gladston e had clumsil y excised this compromisin g passage ! Initial proof: Professor Beesly , in an article in The Fortnightly Review ha d quoted this speech in the same way as the Inaugura l Address .
This coul d lead the reade r to believ e that Professo r Beesly had quote d Gladstone's speec h in an essay on some other historica l theme than the International.
W e therefor e remarked , firstly, that this article dealt with the history of the International , and was written on the basis of materia l that Marx himsel f had provide d the author with.
And Marx does not now deny this.
However , he assures u s that the materia l he provide d did not contain a single word referrin g to the content s of the Inaugura l Address , which had been known to Professo r Beesly since its publication .
However , we never said or insinuate d such a thing.
And we absolutely believ e Mr.
Marx's assurance .
Had he shown Mr.
Beesly The Theory of the Exchanges a s the source of his quotation , Beesly would certainl y have refraine d from reprintin g it.
Secondly , we replied — and this is the main rejoinder : it was not Beesly wh o quoted the passag e in questio n from Gladstone' s speech ; he only cited it in an analysi s of the Inaugura l Address .
We quoted word for word the relevan t sentence fro m Beesly' s article, as can be seen in No.
27 of the Concordia.
Th e fact that Beesly , in his analysis , gave the words "as Mr.
Gladston e observed " withou t quotation marks * is now used by Marx to explai n to his reader s that Beesly , suddenly interruptin g his analysis , said these words on his own behalf!! Marx sough t to find furthe r proof that Gladston e had clumsil y excise d the words in questio n from his speech in the fact that The Theory of the Exchanges, a publication whic h appeare d before the Inaugura l Address , quoted Gladstone' s budget speec h word for word as in the Address .
We checke d with the book, saw that this was correct , but that everythin g suggest s Marx himsel f took his quotatio n from thi s book.
The main sign of this was that Capital b y Marx, on p.
639, especially i n Note 103, quotes this speech in the absolutely senseless versio n given verbatim b y The Theory of the Exchanges o n p.
134.
This suggestio n that The Theory of the Exchanges wa s the source of Marx's quotatio n is further supporte d by the fact that in the passag e in his book Capital wher e he quotes the Gladston e speech just as The Theory of the Exchanges di d on p.
134, he gives other quotation s to be found at the same place in that book, and adds glosses like this.
How does Mr.
Marx reply to this? For a start, that he also added glosses which are not to be found in The Theory of the Exchanges.
Bu t neither is this preclude d by our remark .
Then he states * Additiona l note on republication : Professo r Beesly copied the passag e which he quote d from the Inaugura l Addres s exactly as given there.
There, however , the inserted claus e is naturall y withou t quotatio n marks .
[Note by Brentano.
] that he specificall y named the author of The Theory of the Exchanges a s the author of the quotatio n from Molière.
Bu t we did not claim the contrary .
Finally , regarding th e statemen t of the LONDO N ORPHA N ASYLUM , which Marx quotes on p.
640 of his book just as The Theory of the Exchanges doe s on p.
135, Marx himsel f admits tha t he quoted verbati m from this book, but that he checke d the correctnes s with the origina l sources .
Marx thus testifies himself that part of the glosses which he append s to the quotatio n from Gladstone' s speech come from The Theory of the Exchanges.
H e thus bears witnes s to the correctnes s of the points with which we supported ou r main argumen t that he had also taken from The Theory of the Exchanges th e quotatio n from Gladstone' s speech .
But he has nothin g to say in answer t o this main argument , in answer to the remark that he, like The Theory of the Exchanges, quote s Gladstone' s speech in the same absolutely senseless version.
Thirdly an d finally , Marx attempt s to prove his claim that Gladston e subsequently falsifie d his own budge t speech in the shorthan d report in Hansar d by referrin g to the report of this speech in The Times o f April 17, 1863.
But this report show s the exact opposite , since The Times an d Hansar d fully coincid e materially.
T o obscur e recognitio n of this fact by his readers , Marx utilises various methods.
The first method, designed simultaneousl y to awaken amongs t the reader s of the Volksstaat new admiratio n for the eruditio n of their oracle, was a philologica l lecture.
Gladston e explicitl y stated, also accordin g to the Times report , insofar as Marx quote d this, that he believe d that the intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and powe r of which he had spoken was not confine d "TO THE CLASSE S WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES" , i.
e.
the classes finding themselve s in pleasan t circumstances .
Basing himsel f upon Wakefield , who had writte n a book entitle d The Middle or Uneasy Class* Mar x now claime d that Gladston e had said he believe d this augmentation wa s not confine d to the "really rich", the "really prosperou s portion" o f the propertie d classes ; and since we took no notice of this entire argumentation, h e now accuse s us of suppression .
But if we remaine d silent about this furthe r attemp t at falsification , the only reason was that it was, in fact, too manifest.
Fo r whateve r Wakefiel d may have meant when he called the middle class THE UNEAS Y CLASS the whole contex t of Gladstone' s speech , in the Times repor t too, shows tha t by the "CLASSE S WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES " Gladston e at this point meant those classes which are not part of the working population, since he drew a contrast between them and it.
Marx's second method o f obscurin g the Times repor t was simply to suppress , in his Germa n translatio n of this report , the relativ e clause which showe d that Gladstone ha d only said that the augmentatio n of wealth , which was shown by the income ta x returns , was confine d to the classes of property , since the workin g classes wer e not subject to income tax, and that thus nothin g about the increas e in the prosperit y of the workin g classes could be learned from the income tax returns ; not, however , that the workin g classes in reality had been exclude d from the extraordinary augmentatio n of nationa l wealth .
Marx, who, as we just have seen, quite unwarrantabl y accuse d the Concordia o f suppression , once again quietl y suppressed thi s relative clause, althoug h we had remonstrate d with him about his distortion.
An d even more.
We had stated, in accordanc e with the truth, that the report i n The Times jus t gives, formall y more contracted , what the shorthan d report by Hansar d gives verbatim ; but he denies this and dares to print side by side the Times repor t and that from Hansard , though he naturall y once again omits this relative clause.
Bu t what does it matter? The reader s of the Volksstaat, with whor n he a The referenc e is to the book: [E.
G.
Wakefield, ] England and America.
A Comparison of the Social and Political State of Both Nations, Vol .
I-II, London , 1833.
— Ed.
is concerned , cannot check up on him! Thirdly an d finally , Marx attempte d to concea l the agreemen t betwee n the Times repor t and the Hansar d report by failing to quote those sentence s in which, according t o The Times too , Gladston e directl y and explicitl y testifie d to the elevation o f the British workin g class.
We made a remark about this, and quoted in full the relevan t passage of the Times report .
Despite this, Marx lies to his readers that we had wante d to give the impressio n that we were quotin g The Times according t o his translation ! But against this, he naturall y suppresse s our proof (in No.
28) that the glarin g contradiction , accordin g to Marx, betwee n Gladstone' s claim abou t the improvemen t in the conditio n of the British workin g class and the officially establishe d facts, does not exist in reality ; instead he repeat s once again this accusation .
Apart fro m this, Marx, in his reply in the Volksstaat of Augus t 7, produce s two further witnesse s to.
the correctnes s of his readin g of Gladstone' s budget speech : The Morning Star an d The Morning Advertiser o f April 17, 1863.
But we do not need to check whethe r Marx has quote d the two paper s withou t fresh falsification.
* Fo r these papers , even as he quotes them, speak for us.
After Gladstone ha d said, accordin g to both papers , that he did not believ e this intoxicating augmentatio n of wealth and power is confine d to the classes which find themselve s in pleasan t circumstances , he continued : "This grea t increas e of wealth takes no cognizance at all o f the conditio n of the labourin g population .
The augmentation which I have described i s an augmentatio n entirel y confine d to the classes possesse d of property.
" The contex t and the use of the expressio n "take cognizance" sho w clearly that this increas e and the augmentatio n of the increas e cited, an d the citing, are intende d to indicat e those discernibl e in the income tax returns.
But the introductio n of these new allege d witnesse s is only an expressio n of the faked thoroughness , intende d to perpetuat e the faith of Volksstaat readers i n their oracle.
Marx' s article in the Volksstaat of Augus t 7 is a model of this, and worthy of perusal b y our readers in person .
We need only quote one more exampl e of this, in order to depriv e Mr.
Marx of the argumen t that we wished to concea l from our readers tha t he had correcte d us on a point of minor import .
We had stated that in England person s with an incom e under 150 pound s sterlin g paid no incom e tax.
Mr.
Mar x taunts us that we do not know this tax only ceases on income s under 100 pounds sterling .
In fact the law of 1842 left all income s under 150 pound s sterling quite fre e of tax, but in 1853 the tax was extende d downward s to 100 pound s sterling, althoug h the newly include d income s were treated more lightly, since they were subjecte d to a lower rate of tax than those of 150 pound s sterling and above.
In 1863 the favoure d sector was extende d to 200 pound s sterlin g exclusiv e upwards, an d the tax reductio n grante d in the manne r that for every income from that figur e down to 100 pound s sterlin g inclusive , 60 pound s sterlin g could be subtracted a s tax-free .
Mr.
Mar x closes his article by telling us that lack of time forces him to end, once and for all, his pleasurabl e exchang e of opinion s with us.
We understan d that Mr.
Mar x welcome s the opportunit y of avoidin g somebod y who uncover s his forgeries.
Whe n Mr.
Marx finally ends his article by breakin g into abuse, we can assur e him that his opponent s could desire nothin g more than the confessio n of guilt which lies herein .
Abuse is the weapo n of those whose other means of defence hav e run out.
* Additiona l note on republication : Here too Marx omits the same sentence s which he suppresse d in his reproductio n of the Times report .

ATTAC K BY S.
TAYLO R THE TIMES, NOVEMBE R 29, 1883 * To the Editor of "The Times" Sir,— I ask leave to point out in The Times tha t the origin of the misleadin g quotation fro m Mr.
Gladstone' s Budge t speech of April 16, 1863, which so eminen t a publicis t as Professo r Emile de Laveleye 3 has been led to reproduc e throug h reliance o n Germa n sources , and with respec t to which he inserts a correctio n in The Times o f this day, is to be found as far back as 1864 in an addres s issued by the counci l of the famou s Internationa l Workin g Men's Association.
b What appear s extremel y singula r is that it was reserve d for Professo r Brentano (then of the Universit y of Breslau, now of that of Strassburg ) to expose , eight years later in a German newspaper , the bad faith which had manifestl y dictate d the citation mad e from Mr.
Gladstone' s speech in the address .
Herr Kar l Marx, wh o as the acknowledge d author of the addres s attempte d to defend th e citation , had the hardihood , in the deadly shifts to which Brentano' s masterly conduc t of the attack speedil y reduce d him, to assert Mr.
Gladston e had "manipulated" (zurechtgestümpert) the repor t of his speech in The Times o f April 17 , 1863, before it appeare d in "Hansard" , in order "to obliterate " (wegzupfuschen) a passage which "was certainl y compromisin g for an Englis h Chancellor o f the Exchequer" .
On Brentano' s showing , by a detailed compariso n of texts, that the reports of The Times an d of "Hansard " agreed in utterly excludin g the meanin g which craftily-isolate d quotatio n had put upon Mr.
Gladstone' s words, Marx withdre w from furthe r controvers y under the plea of "want of time"!

ELEANO R MARX' S REPLY TO-DAY, FEBRUAR Y 1884 * To the Editor of " The Times''' Sir,— In The Times o f Novembe r 29th Mr.
Sedley Taylor refers to a certain quotatio n of a speech by Mr.
Gladstone , "to be found as far back as 1864, in an addres s issued by the counci l of the famous Internationa l Workin g Men's Association" .
He continues : (I here quote Mr.
Taylor' s letter from "Wha t appears" t o "want of time") .
The fact s are briefly these.
The quotatio n referre d to consist s of a few sentence s from Mr.
Gladstone' s Budge t speec h of April 16th , 1863.
After describin g the immens e increas e of wealth that took place in this country betwee n 1853 and 1861 Mr.
Glad-stone is made to say: "This intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power is entirely confine d to classes o f property.
" An anonymou s writer, who turns out to be Professo r Brentano, published i n a German paper, Concordia, o f the 7th March , 1872 a reply in which it was stated: "This sentenc e does not exist in Mr.
Gladstone' s speech , Marx has added it lyingly, bot h as to form and contents " {formel und materiel hinzugelogen).
This wa s the only point at issue betwee n my father and his anonymous opponent .
In his replies in the Leipzig Volksstaat, June 1st and Augus t 7th, 1872,a Dr.
Marx quotes the report s of Mr.
Gladstone' s speech as follows: " The Times, Apri l 17th: "The augmentatio n I have described , and which is founded , I think, on accurate returns , is an augmentatio n entirel y confine d to classes of property.
" Morning Star 17t h April: "This augmentatio n is an augmentatio n confine d entirel y to the classe s possessed o f property , Morning Advertiser, Apri l 17th: "The augmentatio n stated is altogethe r limite d to classe s possesse d of property.
" a See this volume , pp.
136-40 , 144-51.
— Ed.
The anonymou s Brentano, i n the "deadl y shifts to which his own masterl y conduc t of the attack had reduce d him", now took refuge unde r the assertio n usual in such circumstances , that if the quotation wa s not a forgery it was, at all events, "misleading" , in "bad faith" , "craftil y isolated" , and so forth.
I am afraid you would no t allow me space to reply to this accusatio n of Herr Brentano, repeated now , after eleven years , by Mr.
Taylor .
Perhaps it will not be required , as Mr.
Taylor says: "The whol e of this Brentano-Mar x correspondenc e is eminentl y worth y of being unearthe d from the file of newspaper s in which it lies buried and republished i n an Englis h form.
" I quite agree with this.
The memor y of my father could only gain by it.
As to the discrepancie s betwee n the newspape r reports of the speech in questio n and the report in "Hansard " I must leave thi s to be settled by those most intereste d in it.
Out of thousand s and thousand s of quotation s to be found in my father' s writing s this is the only one the correctnes s of which has ever been disputed .
The fact that this single and not very lucky instanc e is brough t up again and again by the professoria l economists i s very characteristic .
In the words of Mr.
Taylor , "it throw s upon the latter disputant's " (Dr.
Marx) "standar d of literary honest y a light whic h can ill be spared at a time when his principa l work is presente d to us as nothing les s than a fresh gospel of social renovation" .

SEDLEY TAYLOR' S RETOR T TO-DAY, MARC H 1884 * To the Editors of "To-Day" Gentlemen, No one can regret more than I do that Miss Marx should have been refuse d the publi c hearin g to which she was so manifestl y entitled .
I am, however , far from thinking wit h her that the questio n whethe r a particula r sentenc e did, or did not, occur in Mr.
Gladstone' s speech "was the only point at issue between " Dr.
Marx and Professo r Brentano.
I regard that questio n as having been of very subordinat e importance compare d to the issue whethe r the quotatio n in dispute was made with the intentio n of conveying , or of perverting , Mr.
Gladstone' s meaning .
It would obviousl y be impossibl e to discus s in this letter the content s of the voluminous Brentano-Mar x controvers y withou t making an inadmissibl e deman d on your space.
As, however , Miss Marx has in your column s characterise d as a "calumny" an d "libel" an opinio n publicl y expresse d by me,* I feel bound to ask your insertion , side by side, of the two followin g extracts , which will enable your readers t o judge for themselve s whethe r Dr.
Marx has quoted fairly or unfairl y from the Budge t Speech of 1863 in his great work, "Das Kapital" .
My reaso n for using th e Times repor t in preferenc e to that of Hansar d will be obviou s to reader s of Dr.
Marx' letters in his correspondenc e with Brentano.

"In the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it had increase d from the basis taken in 1853 , 20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing a s to be almost incredibl e ".

Times, Apri l 17, 1863 "In ten years, from 1842 to 1852 inclusive, th e taxabl e incom e of the country, a s nearly as we can make out, increased b y 6 per cent.
; but in eight years, from 1853 to 1861, the incom e of the countr y again increase d from the basis take n by 20 per cent.
That is a fact so strang e as to be almost incred-ible.
.
.
.
"I must say for one, I should look almost with apprehension and with pain upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power if it were my belief that it was confined to the classes who are in easy circumstances.
This takes no cognisance at all of the condition of the labouring population.
Th e augmentatio n I have described, an d which is founded , I think, upo n accurat e returns , is an augmentation entirel y confine d to classes possesse d of property .
Now, the augmentation o f capital is of indirec t benefit t o the labourer , becaus e it cheapens th e commodit y which in the business o f productio n comes into di-rect competitio n with labour .
But we have thi s profound , and I must say, inestimable consolation , that, while the rich hav e been growin g richer , the poor hav e been growin g less poor.
Whether th e extreme s of povert y are less extrem e than they were I do not presume t o say, but the average condition of the British labourer, we have the happi­ ness to know, has improved during the last 20 years in a degree which we know to be extraordinary, and which we may almost pronounce to be unexampled in the history of any country and of any age.

" Mr.
Gladstone , in House of Commons, 1 6 th April, 186 3 I invite especia l attentio n to the hearin g on Mr.
Gladstone' s meanin g of the passages i n the Times repor t which I have thrown into italics.
The sentence , "7 must say .
.
.
easy circumstances," convey s the speaker' s belief that the intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power previousl y describe d was not confine d to those in easy circumstances .
There is, it is true, a verbal contrariet y with the later sentence, "Th e augmentatio n .
.
.
property, " but the intervenin g words, "This takes no cognisance .
.
.
population," unmistakabl y show what Mr.
Gladston e meant, viz.
, that the figure s which he had given, being based on the income-ta x returns , include d only income s above the exemptio n limit,* and therefor e afforde d no indicatio n to what exten t the total earning s of the labourin g populatio n had increase d during the perio d under consideration .
The closing passage , from "but the average" t o the end, announce s in the most emphati c languag e that, on evidenc e independen t of that obtaine d from the income-ta x returns , Mr.
Gladston e recognise d as indubita -ble an extraordinar y and almos t unexample d improvemen t in the averag e condition o f the British labourer .
Now, wit h what object were these essentia l passage s almost wholly struck out in the proces s by which the newspape r report was reduce d to the remarkabl e form in which i t appear s in Dr.
Marx' work? Clearly , I think, in order that the arbitrarily-constructed mosaic , pieced togethe r out of such of Mr.
Gladstone' s words a s were allowe d to remain , might be understoo d as assertin g that the earnings o f the labourin g populatio n had made but insignifican t progress , while the income s of the possessin g classes had increase d enormously— a view which the omitted passage s explicitl y repudiat e in favour of a very differen t opinion .
I must not pass over unnotice d the fact that the Germa n translatio n of this docked citatio n in the text of "Das Kapital " is immediatel y followe d there by the expression o f Dr.
Marx' contemptuou s astonishmen t at the "lame anti-climax " presented b y the sentenc e made to figure as the conclusio n of Mr.
Gladstone' s paragraph, whe n compare d with his previou s descriptio n of the growth of wealth among th e possessin g classes .

ELEANO R MARX' S SECON D REPLY 146 TO-DAY, MARC H 1884 To the Editors of " To-Day" * Gentlemen , Mr.
Sedle y Taylo r dispute s my statemen t that, when the anonymous slandere r fell foul of Dr.
Marx, the only point at issue was whethe r Mr.
Gladston e had used certai n words or not.
According t o him, the real questio n was, "whether th e quotatio n in disput e was made with the intentio n of conveyin g or of pervertin g Mr.
Gladstone' s meaning" .
* This stood at £150 from 1842 to 1853, and was then lowere d to £100.
[Note by Taylor] I have before me the Concordia articl e (No.
10, 7th March , 1872), "How Karl Marx Quotes" .
Here the anonymou s author first quote s the "Inaugura l Address " of the International ; then the passag e of Mr.
Gladstone' s speech , in full, from Hansard ; then he condense s the passag e in his own way, and to his own satisfaction; an d lastly, he concludes , "Marx take s advantag e of this to make Gladston e say, 'This intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power is entirel y confine d to classes possesse d of property.
' This sentence, however, is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech.
The very contrary is said in it.
Marx has lyingly added this sentence, both as to form and contents.
" That is the charge , and the only charge , made against Dr.
Marx.
He is indeed accuse d of pervertin g Mr.
Gladstone' s meanin g by "lyingly adding " a whole sentence .
Not a word about "mislead -ing", or "craftil y isolated " quotations .
The questio n simply is, "whether a particula r sentenc e did, or did not, occur in Mr.
Gladstone' s speech" .
Of two things , one.
Either Mr.
Taylor has read Brentano' s attacks an d my father' s replies , and then his assertio n is in direct contradiction o f what he cannot help knowin g to be the truth.
Or else he has not.
And then? Here is a man who dates his letters from Trinit y College , Cambridge , who goes out of his way to assail my dead father' s literary honest y in a way which must needs turn out to be a "calumny " unless he proves his case; who makes this charge upo n the strengt h of a literary controvers y dating as far back as 1872, betwee n an anonymou s writer (whom Mr.
Taylor now assert s to be Professo r Brentano) and my father ; who describes i n glowin g terms the "masterl y conduct " in which Saint George Brentano led his attack, and the "deadl y shifts" to which he speedil y reduce d the drago n Marx ; who can give us all particulars o f the crushin g results obtaine d by the said St.
George "by a detailed compariso n of texts"; and who after all, puts me into this delicat e positio n that I am in charity bound to assum e that he has never read a line of what he is speakin g about.
Had Mr .
Taylor seen the "masterly " articles of his anonymou s friend, h e would have found therei n the following : "Now w e ask; does anyon e tell a lie only then when he himsel f invent s an untruth, o r does he not tell a lie quite as much when' he repeats it contrar y to what he knows , or is bound to know better?" Thus sait h the "masterly " Brentano, as virtuou s as he is anonymous, i n his rejoinde r to my father' s first reply (Concordia, No.
27, 4th July, 1872, p.
210).
a And on the same page he still maintains agains t all comers : a See this volume , pp.
140-44.
— Ed.
"According t o the Times report , too, Mr.
Gladston e said he believe d this intoxicating augmentatio n of wealth and power not to be confine d to classes of property.
" If Brentano thus appear s utterly ignoran t of what was the real point at issue, is Mr.
Sedley Taylor better off? In his letter to The Times it was a quotatio n made in the "Inaugura l Address " of the International.
I n his letter to To-Day i t is a quotatio n in "Das Kapital".
The groun d is shifted again, but I need not object.
Mr.
Taylo r now gives us the Gladstonia n passag e as quoted on pages 67 8 and 679 of "Das Kapital" , side by side with the same passage a s reported—no t by Hansard , but by The Times.
"My reaso n for using the Times repor t instead of that of Hansard , will be obvious t o reader s of Dr.
Marx's letters and his correspondenc e with Brentano.
" Mr.
Taylor , as we have seen, is not of these "readers" .
His reason fo r his proceedin g may therefor e be obviou s to others, but upon his own showin g at least, it can hardly be so to himself .
Anyhow, fro m Hansar d the Infallibl e we are brough t down to that ver y report , for using which the anonymou s Brentano (Concordia, sam e page, 210), assails my father as quotin g "neces -sarily bunglin g (stümperhafte) newspaper reports" .
At any rate, Mr.
Taylor' s "reason " must be very "obvious " to his friend Brentano.
To me that reason is obviou s indeed .
The words which my father wa s accuse d of having lyingly added ("an augmentation" , etc.
), these words are containe d in The Times a s well as in the other dailies ' reports , while in Hansar d they are not only "manipulated", bu t entirel y "obliterated" .
Marx establishe d this fact.
Mr.
Taylor, in his letter to The Times, stil l awfully shocke d at such unpardonabl e "hardihood" , is now himsel f compelle d to drop the impeachabl e Hansard , and to take refuge under what Brentano calls the "necessaril y bungling " report of The Times.
Now fo r the quotatio n itself.
Mr.
Taylo r invites especia l attention t o two passage s thrown by him into italics.
In the first he owns: "there is, it is true, a verbal contrariety wit h the latter sentence ; the augmentatio n .
.
.
property ; but the intervenin g words : this takes .
.
.
population , unmistakeabl y show wha t Mr.
Gladston e meant, " etc.
, etc.
Here we are plainly on theologica l ground .
It is the well-know n style of orthodo x interpretatio n of the Bible.
The passage , it is true, is in itself contradictory , but if interprete d accordin g to the true fait h of a believer , you will find that it will bear out a meaning no t in contradictio n with that true faith.
If Mr.
Taylor interprets Mr .
Gladston e as Mr.
Gladston e interpret s the Bible, he must no t expect any but the orthodo x to follow him.
Now Mr .
Gladston e on that particula r occasion , either did speak English o r he did not.
If he did not, no manne r of quotatio n or interpretation wil l avail.
If he did, he said that he should be very sorry if that intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power was confined t o classes in easy circumstances , but that it was confine d entirely t o classes of property .
And that is what Marx quoted .
The secon d passag e is one of those stock phrase s which are repeated, wit h slight variations , in every British budge t speech , seasons o f bad trade alone excepted .
What Marx though t of it, and of the whole speech is shown in the followin g extract from his second repl y to his anonymou s slanderer ; "Gladstone, havin g poure d forth his panegyri c on the increas e of capitalis t wealth, turns toward s the workin g class.
He takes good care no t to say that they had share d in the intoxicatin g augmentation o f wealth and power .
On the contrary , he continue s (according t o The Times): 'Now , the augmentatio n of capital is of indirect benefi t to the labourers, ' etc.
He consoles himsel f with the fact that while the rich have been growin g richer, the poor have been growin g less poor.
He asserts , finally, he and his enriche d parliamentary friend s 'have the happines s to know' the contrar y of what officia l enquirie s and statistica l dates prove to be the fact, viz.
, " 'that the averag e conditio n of the British laboure r has improve d during the last 20 years in a degree which we know to be extraordinary , and which we may almost pronounc e to be unexample d in the history of any countr y and of any age.
' " "Before Mr .
Gladstone , all his predecessor s 'had the happiness ' to complet e in their budget speeche s the picture of the augmenta -tion of capitalis t wealth by self-complacen t phrase s about the improvement i n the conditio n of the workin g class.
Yet he gives the lie to them all; for the millenniu m dates only from the passing of the Free Trade legislation .
But the correctnes s or incorrectnes s of Gladstone' s reason s for consolatio n and congratulatio n is a matter o f indifferenc e here.
What alone concern s us is this, that from his stand-poin t the pretende d 'extraordinary ' improvemen t in the conditio n of the working-clas s is not at all in contradictio n with the augmentatio n of wealth and power which is entirel y confined t o classes possesse d of property .
It is the orthodo x doctrine o f the mouth-piece s of capital — one of the best paid of whom is Gladston e — that the most infallibl e means for workin g men to benefi t themselve s is—to enrich their exploiters.

a Moreover, t o please Mr.
Taylor, the said passag e of Mr.
Glad-stone's speec h is quoted in full i n the Inaugura l Address , page 5, immediately befor e the quotatio n in dispute .
And what else but this addres s did Mr.
Taylor originall y impute ? Is it as impossibl e to get a referenc e to origina l sources out of him, as it was to get reasons ou t of Dogberry ? "The continuou s crying contradiction s in Gladstone' s budge t speeches" for m the subject of Note 105 on the same page (679) of "Das Kapital " to which Mr.
Taylor refers us.
Very likely indeed , that Mar x should have taken the troubl e to suppres s "in bad faith" on e of the contradictions ! Quite the contrary .
He has not suppressed anythin g worth quoting , neithe r has he "lyingly " added anything .
But he has restored , rescue d from oblivion , a particular sentenc e of one of Mr.
Gladstone' s speeches , a sentenc e which ha d indubitabl y been pronounced , but which someho w or other ha d found its way—ou t of Hansard .

FROM ENGELS' PREFACE T O THE FOURT H GERMA N EDITIO N OF MARX' S CAPITAL, VOLUM E ONE 3 Meanwhile a complet e revisio n of the numerou s quotation s had been mad e necessar y by the publicatio n of the English edition.
13 For this editio n Marx' s younges t daughter , Eleanor , undertoo k to compare al l the quotation s with their originals , so that those taken from Englis h sources , which constitut e the vast majority , are given there no t as retranslations from Germa n but in the origina l English form .
In preparin g the fourth editio n it was therefor e incumbent upo n me to consul t this text.
The compariso n reveale d various smal l inaccuracies .
Page number s wrongl y indicated , due partly to mistake s in copyin g from notebooks , and partly to the accumulated misprint s of three editions ; misplace d quotatio n or omission marks , which canno t be avoide d when a mass of quotations i s copied from noteboo k extracts ; here and there some rather unhapp y translatio n of a word; particula r passage s quoted from th e old Paris notebook s of 1843-45 , when Marx did not know Englis h and was readin g Englis h economist s in Frenc h translations, 0 so that the doubl e translatio n yielde d a slightly different shad e of meaning , e.

But anyone who compares th e fourth edition with the previou s ones can convinc e himself tha t all this laboriou s proces s of emendatio n has not produced th e smalles t change in the book worth speakin g of.
There wa s only one quotatio n which could not be traced—th e one from Richar d Jones (4th edition , p.
562, Note 47).
Marx probabl y slipped u p when writing down the title of the book.
3 All the other quotations retai n their cogenc y in full, or have enhance d it due to their presen t exact form.
Here, however , I am oblige d to revert to an old story.
I know of only one case in which the accurac y of a quotatio n given by Marx has been called in question .
But as the issue dragged beyon d his lifetim e I cannot well ignore it here.
On Marc h 7, 1872, there appeare d in the Berlin Concordia, organ of the Germa n Manufacturers ' Association , an anonymou s article entitled : "How Karl Marx Quotes".
b It was here asserted , with an effervescenc e of moral indignatio n and unparliamentar y language, tha t the quotatio n from Gladstone' s budget speech of April 16 , 1863 (in the Inaugura l Addres s of the Internationa l Working Men' s Association , 1864, and repeate d in Capital, Vol .
I, p.
617, 4th edition ; p.
671, 3rd edition), 0 had been falsified ; that not a single word of the sentence : "this intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power .

.
is entirely confine d to classes of property " was to be found in the (semi-official ) shorthan d repor t in Hansard.
"Ye t this sentenc e is nowher e to be found in Gladstone' s speech.
I t says quite the opposite.
" (In bold type): "Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content!" Marx, to whom the numbe r of Concordia wa s sent the followin g May, answere d Anonymou s in the Volksstaat of June lst.
d As he could no t recall which newspape r report he had used for the quotation, h e limite d himsel f to citing , first the equivalen t quotation fro m two Englis h publications , and then the report in The Times, accordin g to which Gladston e says: * "That is the state of the case as regard s the wealth of this country .

This takes no cognizanc e at all of the conditio n of the labourin g population .
The augmentatio n I have describe d and which is founded , I think, upon accurat e returns , is an augmentatio n entirel y confined t o classes of property.
" * Thus Gladston e says here that he would be sorry if it were so, but it is so: this intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power is entirely confine d to classes of property .
And as to the semi-officia l Hansard, Mar x goes on to say: "In its edition , here botchil y corrected, Mr .
Gladston e was bright enough clumsil y to excise the passage tha t would be, after all, compromisin g on the lips of an English Chancello r of the Exchequer .
This is, incidentally , traditional Englis h parliamentar y practice , and by no means the invention o f little Lasker versus Bebel.
" 147 Anonymous get s angrie r and angrier .
In his answe r in the Concordia, Jul y 4,a he sweep s aside second-han d source s and demurely suggest s that it is the "custom " to quote parliamentar y speeches fro m the shorthan d report ; adding , however , that the Times repor t (which include s the "lyingl y added " sentence ) and the Hansar d report (which omits it) "fully coincid e materially" , while th e Times repor t likewis e contain s "the direct opposit e of that notoriou s passag e in the Inaugura l Address" .
This fellow carefully conceal s the fact that the Times repor t explicitl y include s that self-sam e "notoriou s passage" , alongsid e of its allege d "opposite".
Despit e all this, however , Anonymou s feels that he is stuck fas t and that only some new dodge can save him.
Thus, whilst hi s article bristles , as we have just shown, with "impuden t mendacity" an d is interlarde d with such edifyin g terms of abuse as "bad faith" , "dishonesty" , "lying statement" , "that lying quota-tion", "impuden t mendacity" , "a quotatio n completel y forged" , "this forgery" , "simpl y nefarious" , etc.
, he finds it necessar y to divert th e issue to anothe r domai n and therefor e promise s "to explain i n a second article the importanc e which we" (the non-"mendacious" Anonymous ) "attach to the conten t of Glad-stone's words" .
As if his particula r opinion , of no decisiv e value as it is, had anythin g whateve r to do with the matter .
This second article wa s printed in the Concordia o n July 11.
Marx replie d again in the Volksstaat of Augus t 7b now giving also the report s of the passag e in questio n from The Morning Star an d The Morning Advertiser o f April 17, 1863.

believed it to be confined t o CLASSE S IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES .
But this augmentation was i n fact ENTIREL Y CONFINE D TO CLASSE S POSSESSE D OF PROPERTY.
S o these report s too reproduce d word for word the sentence allege d to have been "lyingl y added" .
Marx furthe r established onc e more, by a compariso n of the Times an d the Hansard texts , that this sentence , which three newspape r report s of identica l content , appearin g independentl y of one anothe r the next morning , proved to have been really uttered , was missin g from th e Hansar d report , revise d accordin g to the familia r "custom", an d that Gladstone , to use Marx' s words , "had subsequently filche d it away".
In conclusio n Marx stated that he had no time for further intercours e with Anonymous .
The latter also seem s to have had enough , at any rate Marx receive d no further issue s of Concordia.
With thi s the matter appeare d to be dead and buried .
True, once or twice later on there reache d us, from person s in touch with the Universit y of Cambridge , mysteriou s rumour s of an unspeakable literar y crime which Marx was suppose d to have committed i n Capital; bu t despite all investigatio n nothin g more definite coul d be learned .
Then, on Novembe r 29, 1883, eight months afte r Marx's death, there appeare d in The Times a letter dated fro m Trinit y College , Cambridge , and signe d Sedle y Taylor,3 i n which this little man, who dabble s in the mildes t sort of co-operative affairs , seizing upon some chance pretex t or other, at last enlightene d us, not only concernin g those vague Cambridg e rumours, bu t also Anonymou s in the Concordia.
"What appear s extremel y singular, " says the little man from Trinit y College , "is that it was reserve d for Professor Brentano (then of the Universit y of Breslau, now of that of Strassburg ) to expose .

the bad faith which had manifestl y dictate d the citation mad e from Mr.

Herr Karl Marx , who .

Gladston e had 'manipulated ' the report of his speech in The Times of April 17, 1863, before it appeare d in Hansard , in order to 'obliterate ' a passage whic h 'was certainl y compromisin g for an Englis h Chancello r of the Exchequer'.

Thus he stood, sword in hand, and thus he battled , in his "masterl y conduc t of the attack" , this St.
George of the German Manufacturers ' Association , whilst the inferna l drago n Marx, "i n deadly shifts" , "speedily " breathe d his last at his feet.
All this Ariostia n battle-scene , however , only serves to concea l the dodge s of our St.
George .
Here there is no longer talk of "lying addition " or "forgery" , but of "CRAFTIL Y ISOLATE D QUOTA -TION".
Th e whole issue was shifted , and St.
George and his Cambridge squir e very well knew why.
Eleanor Mar x replied in the monthl y journa l To-Day (Februar y 1884) a, as The Times refuse d to publish her letter.
She "once more focussed th e debate on the sole questio n at issue: had Marx "lyingly added " that sentenc e or not? To this Mr.
Sedley Taylor answered tha t "the questio n whethe r a particula r sentenc e did or did not occur in Mr.
Gladstone' s speech " had been, in his opinion , "of very subordinat e impor -tance" i n the Brentano-Mar x controversy , "compare d to the issue whethe r the quotation i n disput e was made with the intentio n of conveying , or of perverting , Mr.
Gladstone' s meaning" .
He then admit s that the Times repor t contain s "a verbal contrariety"; but , if the contex t is rightly interpreted , i.
e.
, in the Gladstonian Libera l sense, it shows what Mr.
Gladston e meant t o sayf {To-Day, Marc h 1884.
) b The most comic point here is that our little Cambridg e man now insists upon quotin g the speech not from Hansard , as, accordin g to the anonymou s Brentano, it is "customary" t o do, but from the Times report , which the same Brentano had characterise d as "necessaril y bungling" .
Naturall y so, for in Hansar d the vexatiou s sentenc e is missing.
Eleanor Mar x had no difficult y (in the same issue of To-Day)c in dissolvin g all this argumentatio n into thin air.
Either Mr.
Taylor had rea d the controvers y of 1872 in which case he was now making no t only "lying additions " but also "lying suppressions" ; or he had not read it and ought to remain silent.
In either case it was certai n that he did not dare to maintai n for a momen t the accusation o f his friend Brentano that Mar x had made a "lying" addition.
O n the contrary , Marx, it now seems , had not lyingly added bu t suppresse d an importan t sentence .
But this same sentence i s quoted on page 5 of the Inaugura l Address , a few lines before th e alleged "lying addition" .

Sedle y Taylor to resolve them into complacen t Libera l sentiments .
Eleano r Marx, in concludin g her reply , finally sums up as follows : "Marx ha s not suppresse d anythin g worth quoting , neither has he 'lyingly ' added anything .
But he has restored , rescue d from oblivion, a particula r sentenc e of one of Mr.

" With tha t Mr.

BRENTANO' S REPL Y "My Polemic with Karl Marx", Berlin, 1890, pp.
3-5 On Septembe r 28, 1864, a public meetin g was held in St.
Martin' s Hall, Long Acre, London , at which Englishmen , Germans , Frenchmen , Poles and Italian s were represented.
Kar l Marx submitte d to this meetin g the Provisiona l Rules of an international workers ' organisatio n which was to be founded , togethe r with the Inaugural Addres s he had drafted for the same.
Both were adopte d unanimously , and the Inaugura l Addres s went round the world.
It containe d a quotatio n from Gladstone's budge t speech of April 16, 1863, which attracte d more attentio n than all the other statement s containe d therein : "Dazzled b y the 'Progres s of the Nation ' statistic s dancin g before his eyes, the Chancellor o f the Excheque r exclaim s in wild ecstasy : 'From 1842 to 1852 the taxable incom e of the countr y increase d by 6 per cent; in the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it has increase d from the basis taken in 1853, 20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing a s to be almost incredible!.
.
.
This intoxicatin g augmentatio n of wealth and power, ' adds Mr.
Gladstone , 'is entirel y confine d to classes of property.
' " In the winter of 1871-72 , while workin g on the second volum e of my Die Arbeitergilden der Gegenwart, I was obliged to investigat e (cf.
II, 241) to what extent the oft-hear d objectio n — that a wage increas e diminishe s the future deman d for labour—accords wit h the facts.
In the previou s decade s this objectio n had a Ibid.

— Ed.
repeatedly bee n used agains t the Englis h trade association s every time they called for wage increases .
Here I recalled this quotatio n from Gladstone' s budget speech .
However, i t appeare d to me to be unwise to quote as a source the Addres s of the International, a s many others had, and the relevan t passag e in Marx's Capital, Vol I, 1867, p.
639; I consulte d the shorthan d report of Gladstone' s budget speech and foun d that this in fact showed that the wage increase s in the period 1842-186 1 had not limited the increas e in the incom e of the possessin g classes in any way which negativel y affecte d their deman d for labour ; but that, on the contrar y Gladstone ha d stated in direct oppositio n to Karl Marx's claim: "The figures which I have quoted take little or no cognizanc e of the conditio n of those who do not pay income ta x .
.
.
of the propert y of the labourin g population , or of the increas e of its income.
.
.
Bu t if we look to the averag e conditio n of the British labourer , whethe r peasant, o r miner, or operative , or artisan , we know from varied and indubitabl e evidence tha t during the last twenty years such an additio n has been made to his means of subsistenc e as we may almost pronounc e to be withou t exampl e in the history of any countr y and of any age.
" In view of the great importanc e of the Gladstone' s quotatio n for the Social Democratic clai m that in the framewor k of the existin g state and social order the rich woul d necessaril y becom e ever richer and the poor ever poorer , I drew the attention o f the editors of the Concordia, Zeitschrift für die Arbeiterfrage, at that time appearing i n Berlin , to the forgery which had been committe d here.
They asked me to write an article on the subject , which was publishe d in the Concordia o f March 7 , 1872.
a The article was not signed by me; this was done, on the one hand, at the reques t of the editors in the interest s of the reputatio n of their paper, and, on the other hand, I had all the less objection , since followin g earlier literary controversies pursue d by Marx it was to be expecte d that this time too he would heap persona l insults upon his adversary , and that for this reason it could only be amusing t o leave him in the dark as to the identit y of his adversary .
Three month s later Marx replied in the Volksstaat.
I n the polemi c which then developed i t became clear that Marx had not undertake n the forgery himself, but had take n the forged quotatio n from a diatribe which had been publishe d anony -mously i n 1864.

Being of such a nature, this book has understandably remaine d in thoroug h obscurity .
Had Mar x simply admitte d that he had been misled by this book, and from then on reproduce d the quotatio n correctly , one might have been surprise d that he had relie d upon such a source, but the mistak e would at least have been rectified .
But for him there was no questio n of this.
And given the wide circulatio n which had bee n attaine d by the Inaugura l Address , the loss of this show-piec e as the result of this correction , would have been very embarrassin g for the agitation .
One of the main agitationa l method s of Social Democrac y is that its representative s proclaim themselve s the sole proprietor s of real science ; and as the Party Congres s in Halle 148 showed , they prefer to accuse themselve s of having utilised the iron law of wages in deliberat e untruthfulnes s simply as a means of agitation , rather than a See this volume , pp.

confess tha t they have been shown to be in error.
Instead of withdrawing , Marx therefore attempte d to prove that Gladston e had subsequentl y tinkere d with the shorthand repor t of his budget speech ; the loutishnesse s of his scurrilou s polemic s was now directe d agains t the suppose d manufacturer , who had attempte d to tell him wha t to do with the help of an Englis h busines s partner ; when it was shown that The Times too , in its issue which appeare d on the mornin g followin g the night in which Gladston e had made his speech , carried this speech in a sense accordin g with the shorthan d report , he acted, as the editors of the Concordia wrote 3: "like the cuttlefish, whic h dims the water with a dark fluid, in order to make pursui t by its enemy mor e difficult , i.

he tries as hard as he can to hide the subjec t of controversy b y clingin g to completel y inconsequentia l secondar y matters ; and finally h e saves himsel f with the explanatio n that for 'lack of time' he cannot go into the matter any further.
" And for all time he failed to reply to my analysi s of his rejoinde r publishe d in the Concordia o n Augus t 22, 1872.
The fact that I was the author of the article s in the Concordia o f March 7, July 4 and 11, and Augus t 22, 1872 b was known to a number of people , and in the second editio n of Mehring' s Geschichte der Sozialdemokratie, 0 which was publishe d while Mar x was still alive, I was publicl y named as such.
Having his attentio n thus drawn to it, Mr.
Sedley Taylor of Trinity College , Cambridg e studied the polemic , and wrot e a letter about it to The TimesA Thi s brough t upon the scene Miss Eleanor Marx , daughte r of Karl Marx, who had died in the meantime , and in the socialist monthl y To-Day o f March 1884 she not only defende d her father's loyalty , but close d with the remark that her father had restore d and rescue d from oblivio n a particula r sentenc e from one of Gladstone' s speeches , a sentenc e which had indubitably bee n pronounced , but which someho w or other had found its way out of the shorthan d report in Hansard.
e Even at that time I considere d replyin g to this obstinat e clingin g to the false quotation wit h the verbati m publicatio n of the entire polemic .
But editors often have thei r own judgement ; the specialis t journal which I regarde d as suitable above all other s refuse d to publish , on the ground s that the disput e lacked genera l interest.
Engels wa s obviously o f a differen t opinion .
In the Preface to the fourth edition o f the first volum e of Capital, whic h he undertook , he returne d to the polemic, bu t reporte d upon it in such a manner that the dishonest y with which it had been conducte d by Marx was, understandably , not made clear; in additio n he left unchange d the passag e in Capital, I , 4th edition , p.
617, in which Marx had Gladstone sa y the opposit e of what he really said; and even more, while Marx in his first edition simply referre d to "Gladston e in H.

" * Noteworthy for the connectio n betwee n The Theory of the Exchanges, an d Marx's remarks in Capital, I, 1st edition, p.
639 is also the following .
Having advance d here the details, quoted from The Theory of the Exchanges, give n by the LONDON ORPHAN ASYLUM , against Gladstone' s sentenc e "WHETHE R THE EXTREME S OF POVERT Y ARE LESS EXTREM E THAN THEY WERE, I DO NOT PRESUM E TO SAY" , Marx turns agains t Gladstone's budge t speech of April 7, 1864; The Theory of the Exchanges has an APPENDIX, in which, as a supplemen t to the pages just printed here, there is also a gloss on the budget of 1864.
The style in which this is done is the same as that which is familiar enough from the foregoing .
This excursu s contain s the followin g passage (p .
234): * "But the Chancello r is eloquen t upon 'poverty'.
.
.
'Think of those who are on the borde r of that region.
.
.
' , upon 'wages .
.
.
in others it is true not increased.

Here too again, instead of the reproductio n of the actual budget speech verbatim , [we find] the same mosai c of sentence s torn from their contex t as in The Theory of the Exchanges.
And her e too it is not this source which is referred to, but simply to Gladstone , H.

C, Apri l 7, 1864.
And then the text continues : "The continua l crying contradictions in Gladstone' s budget speeche s of 1863 and 1864 were characterise d by an English writer by the followin g quotatio n from Molière" (followed by the verse fro m Molière printed above) .
It become s clear that Marx took not only this quotation , but also the "continua l crying contradiction s in Gladstone' s budget speeche s of 1863 and 1864" , invente d by the author of The Theory of the Exchanges, fro m this book.
b) As was already remarke d in the introductio n to this reprint , Engels, i n the fourth editio n of the first volume of Marx's Capital, p .

GLADSTON E TO BRENTANO DEUTSCHES WOCHENBLATT, No.
49, DECEMBE R 4, 1890 Message In numbe r 45 of the Deutsches Wochenblatt Professor Luj o Brentano published an essay "My Polemi c with Karl Marx" , which served at the same time as an introduction t o a republicatio n of this polemi c as a pamphlet .
This polemi c dealt mainly wit h a parliamentar y speech delivere d by Gladston e in 1863, and which Marx reproduce d in a distorte d form in his Inaugura l Addres s on the formatio n of the Internationa l Workin g Men's Association .
Obviously nobod y is more qualifie d to settle this dispute about the wordin g of Gladstone's speec h than Gladston e himself .
It is therefor e of special interes t that Gladstone, a s a result of the republicatio n of Brentano' s polemi c with Marx, has addressed tw o letters to Brentano.
On Novembe r 22 Gladston e wrote to Brentano: "You ar e completel y correct , and Marx completel y incorrect" , and on November 28 : "I undertoo k no change s of any sort".
Thus the affair, which throws a revealin g light on the Social Democrati c line of argumentation , may finally be decide d to the detrimen t of the Social Democrati c standpoint .
By uncoverin g this deceit Brentano has done a service, and it was very timely that he chose this precise momen t to rekindl e the memorie s of this dispute .

[GREETINGS T O THE FRENC H WORKER S ON THE 20TH ANNIVERSAR Y OF THE PARIS COMMUNE ] London, Marc h 17 Citizens an d citizenesses , It is twenty years ago today that working-clas s Paris rose as one man agains t the crimina l attack of the bourgeoi s and the rurals, led by Thiers .
These enemie s of the proletaria t tremble d when they saw the worker s of Paris armed and organise d to defen d their rights .
Thiers though t to depriv e them of the arms which they had used with glory agains t the foreign invasio n and which they woul d use even more gloriousl y agains t the attacks of the Versailles mercenaries .
To crush Paris in revolt the rurals and the bourgeois begge d for and obtaine d the Prussians ' assistance .
After an heroi c struggle , Paris was crushe d by weight of number s and disarmed.
For twent y years now the worker s of Paris have been withou t arms, and it is the same everywhere : in all the large civilise d countries th e proletaria t is deprive d of the materia l means of defence.
Everywher e it is the adversarie s and exploiter s of the working clas s who have armed forces under their exclusiv e control.
What ha s all this led to? It means that today, when every able-bodie d man serves in the army, thi s army increasingl y reflect s popula r feeling s and ideas, and this army, the great means of repression , is becomin g less secure da y by day: already the heads of all the big states foresee with terro r the day when soldier s under arms will refuse to butche r their father s and brothers .

INTRODUCTION [TO KAR L MARX' S THE CIVIL WAR IN FRANCE] h I did not anticipat e that I would be asked to prepar e a new edition o f the Addres s of the Genera l Counci l of the Internationa l on The Civil War in France, an d to write an introductio n to it.
Therefore I can only touch briefly here on the most importan t points.
I am prefacin g the longer work mentione d above by the two shorter Addresse s of the Genera l Counci l on the Franco-Prussia n War.
a In the first place, because the second of these, which itself cannot b e fully understoo d withou t the first, is referre d to in The Civil War.
Bu t also becaus e these two Addresses , likewise drafted by Marx , are, no less than The Civil War, outstandin g example s of the author' s remarkabl e gift, first prove d in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte^ fo r graspin g clearly the character , the import an d the necessar y consequence s of great historica l events, at a time when these events are still in progres s before our eyes or have onl y just taken place.
And, finally , becaus e today we in Germany ar e still having to endure the consequence s which Marx predicted woul d follow from these events .
Has that which was declare d in the first Addres s not come to pass: that if Germany' s defensiv e war agains t Louis Bonapart e degenerated int o a war of conques t against the French people , all the miserie s that befell German y after the so-calle d wars of independence 153 would revive again with renewe d intensity? c Have we not had a further twent y years of Bismarck' s rule, the a See presen t edition , Vol.

Exceptional La w and socialist-baitin g taking the place of the prosecution o f demagogues, 104 with the same arbitrar y action of the polic e and with literall y the same staggerin g interpretation s of the law? 155 And has not the predictio n been proved to the letter, that the annexation o f Alsace-Lorrain e would "force France into the arms of Russia", 3 and that after this annexatio n German y must either become th e avowe d servan t of Russia , or must, after some short respite, ar m for a new war, and, moreover , "a war of races— a war with the combine d Slavonia n and Roman races"? b Has not the annexation o f the French province s driven France into the arms of Russia? Ha s not Bismarc k for fully twenty years vainly wooed the favour o f the tsar, wooed it with service s even more lowly than those whic h little Prussia , before it became the "first Power in Europe", wa s wont to lay at Holy Russia' s feet? And is there not every da y still hangin g over our heads the Damocles ' sword of war, on the first day of which all the chartere d covenant s of princes wil l be scattere d like chaff; a war of which nothin g is certain bu t the absolut e uncertaint y of its outcome ; a race war which wil l subject the whole of Europe to devastatio n by fifteen or twenty millio n armed men, and which is not raging alread y only because eve n the stronges t of the great militar y states shrink s before th e absolut e incalculabilit y of its final result? All the more is it our duty to make again accessibl e to the German worker s these brillian t proofs, now half-forgotten , of the farsightedness o f internationa l working-clas s policy in 1870.
What is true of these two Addresse s is also true of The Civil War in France.
O n May 28, the last fighter s of the Commun e succumbed t o superio r forces on the slopes of Belleville ; and only two days later, on May 30, Marx read to the Genera l Counci l the work in which the historica l significanc e of the Paris Commun e is delineated i n short, powerfu l strokes , but with such trenchancy , and abov e all such truth as has never again been attaine d in all the mass of literatur e on this subject .
Thanks t o the economi c and politica l developmen t of France since 1789 , Paris has been placed for the last fifty years in such a position tha t no revolutio n could break out there withou t assuming a proletaria n character , that is to say, withou t the proletariat, whic h had bough t victory with its blood, advancin g its own demand s after victory .

unclear an d even confused , correspondin g to the state of development reache d by the worker s of Paris at the particula r period, bu t in the last resort they all amounte d to the abolitio n of the class antagonis m betwee n capitalist s and workers .
It is true that no one knew how this was to be brough t about.
But the deman d itself, howeve r indefinitel y it still was couched , containe d a threat to the existin g order of society ; the worker s who put it forwar d were stil l armed; therefore , the disarmin g of the worker s was the first commandmen t for the bourgeois , who were at the helm of the state .
Hence, after every revolutio n won by the workers , a new struggle, endin g with the defeat of the workers .
This happene d for the first time in 1848.
The liberal bourgeoi s of the parliamentar y oppositio n held banquet s for securin g a reform o f the franchise, 156 whic h was to ensure supremac y for their party .
Forced more and ftiore, in their struggl e with the government, t o appeal to the people , they had graduall y to yield precedence t o the radical and republica n strata of the bourgeoisi e and pett y bourgeoisie .
But behind these stood the revolutionar y workers, an d since 1830 these had acquire d far more politica l independence tha n the bourgeois , and even the republicans , suspected.
A t the momen t of the crisis betwee n the governmen t and the opposition , the worker s began street-fighting ; Louis Philippe vanished , and with him the franchis e reform ; and in its place aros e the republic , and indeed one which the victoriou s workers themselve s designate d as a "social" republic .
No one, however, wa s clear as to what this social republi c was to imply; not even the worker s themselves .
But they now had arms and were a power in the state.
Therefore , as soon as the bourgeoi s republi -cans in contro l felt somethin g like firm groun d under their feet, their firs t aim was to disarm the workers .
This took place by driving the m into the insurrectio n of June 1848 by direct breach of faith , by open defianc e and the attemp t to banish the unemployed t o a distant province .
The governmen t had taken care to have an overwhelmin g superiorit y of force.
After five days' heroic struggle , the worker s were defeated .
And then followe d a blood-bath amon g the defenceles s prisoners , the like of which has not been seen since the days of the civil wars which ushere d in the downfall o f the Roma n republic .
It was the first time that the bourgeoisie showe d to what insane crueltie s of reveng e it will be goaded th e momen t the proletaria t dares to take its stand agains t the bourgeoisi e as a separat e class, with its own interest s and demands.
An d yet 1848 was only child's play compare d with the frenzy o f the bourgeoisi e in 1871.
14-1550 Punishment followe d hard at heel.
If the proletaria t was not yet able to rule France , the bourgeoisi e could no longer do so.
At least not at that period , when the greate r part of it was still monarchically inclined , and it was divide d into three dynasti c parties157 an d a fourth, republica n party.
Its interna l dissension s allowed th e adventurer , Louis Bonaparte , to take possessio n of all the commandin g points — army, police, administrativ e machine -ry— and on Decembe r 2, 1851, to explod e the last stronghol d of the bourgeoisie , the Nationa l Assembly.
138 The Secon d Empir e began—the exploitatio n of France by a gang of politica l and financial adventurers , but at the same time also an industria l development suc h as had never been possibl e under the narrow -minded an d timorou s system of Louis Philippe , with the exclusiv e domination o f only a small section of the big bourgeoisie .
Louis Bonaparte too k the politica l power from the capitalist s under the pretext o f protectin g them, the bourgeois , from the workers , and on the other hand the worker s from them; but in return his rule encouraged speculatio n and industria l activity—i n a word, the insurgence an d enrichmen t of the whole bourgeoisi e to an extent hitherto unknown .
To an even greate r extent , it is true, corruption an d mass thiever y developed , clusterin g aroun d the imperial court , and drawin g their heavy percentage s from this enrichment.
But the Second Empir e was the appeal to French chauvinism , was the deman d for the restoratio n of the frontier s of the First Empire, whic h had been lost in 1814, or at least those of the First Republic.
A French empir e within the frontier s of the old monarchy and , in fact, within the even more amputate d frontier s of 1815 — such a thing was impossibl e for any length of time.
Hence th e necessit y for occasiona l wars and extension s of frontiers.
Bu t no extensio n of frontier s was so dazzlin g to the imagination o f the Frenc h chauvinist s as the extensio n to the German lef t bank of the Rhine.
One square mile on the Rhine was more to them than ten in the Alps or anywher e else.
Given the Second Empire , the deman d for the restoratio n of the left bank of the Rhine , either all at once or piecemeal , was merely a question of time.
The time came with the Austro-Prussia n War of 1866 159; cheated o f the anticipate d "territoria l compensation " by Bismarc k and by his own over-cunning , hesitan t policy, there was now nothing lef t for Napoleo n but war, which broke out in 1870 and drove hi m first to Sedan , and thence to Wilhelmshöhe.
160 The necessar y consequenc e was the Paris Revolutio n of Sep-tember 4 , 1870.
The empire collapse d like a house of cards, and the republi c was again proclaimed .
But the enemy was standin g at the gates ; the armie s of the empir e were either hopelessl y encircled a t Metz or held captive in Germany .
In this emergenc y the peopl e allowe d the Paris deputie s to the forme r legislativ e body to constitut e themselve s into a "Governmen t of Nationa l Defence".
Thi s was the more readily conceded , since, for the purposes o f defence , all Parisian s capabl e of bearin g arms had enrolled i n the Nationa l Guard and were armed , so that now the workers constitute d a great majority .
But very soon the antago -nism betwee n the almost completel y bourgeoi s governmen t and the armed proletaria t broke into open conflict .
On Octobe r 31, workers' battalion s storme d the town hall and capture d part of the membership o f the government .
Treachery , the government' s direct breac h of its undertakings , and the interventio n of some petty-bourgeois battalion s set them free again, and in order not to occasion th e outbrea k of civil war inside a city besiege d by a foreign militar y power , the former governmen t was left in office.
At last, on Januar y 28, 1871, starved Paris capitulated .
But with honours unprecedente d in the history of war.
The forts were surrendered, th e city wall strippe d of guns, the weapon s of the regiments o f the line and of the Mobile Guard were handed over, and they themselve s considere d prisoner s of war.
But the Nationa l Guard kep t its weapon s and guns, and only entere d into an armistice wit h the victors .
And these did not dare enter Paris in triumph.
The y only dared to occupy a tiny corner of Paris, which, into the bargain , consiste d partly of public parks, and even this they only occupie d for a few days! And during this time they, who had maintaine d their encirclemen t of Paris for 131 days, were themselves encircle d by the armed worker s of Paris, who kept a sharp watc h that no "Prussian " shoul d overste p the narro w bounds o f the corner ceded to the foreign conqueror .
Such was the respec t which the Paris worker s inspire d in the army before which al l the armies of the empire had laid down their arms; and the Prussia n Junkers , who had come to take reveng e at the home of the revolution , were compelle d to stand by respectfully , and salute precisel y this armed revolution ! During th e war the Paris worker s had confine d themselve s to demanding th e vigorou s prosecutio n of the fight.
But now, when peace ha d come after the capitulatio n of Paris, 161 now Thiers , the new suprem e head of the government , was compelle d to realise that the rule of the propertie d classes—bi g landowner s and capitalists—was i n constan t danger so long as the worker s of Paris had arm s in their hands.
His first action was an attemp t to disarm l-r them.
O n March 18, he sent troops of the line with orders to rob the Nationa l Guard of the artiller y belongin g to it, which had been constructed durin g the siege of Paris and had been paid for by public subscription .
The attemp t failed; Paris mobilise d as one man for resistance , and war betwee n Paris and the Frenc h Government sittin g at Versaille s was declared .
On March 26 the Paris Commun e was elected and on March 28 it was proclaimed .
The Centra l Committe e of the Nationa l Guard, which up to then had carrie d on the government , handed in its resignatio n to the Commune afte r it had first decreed the abolitio n of the scandalou s Paris "Moralit y Police" .
On March 30 the Commun e abolishe d conscription an d the standin g army, and declare d the sole armed force to be the Nationa l Guard , in which all citizens capabl e of bearing arm s were to be enrolled .
It remitte d all payment s of rent for dwellin g houses from Octobe r 1870 until April, the amount s already pai d to be booked as future rent payments , and stoppe d all sales of articles pledge d in the municipa l loan office.

a On April 1 it was decide d that the highes t salary to be receive d by any employe e of the Commune , and therefore als o by its member s themselves , was not to exceed 6,000 franc s (4,800 marks) .
On the followin g day the Commun e decreed th e separatio n of the church from the state, and the abolition o f all state payment s for religiou s purpose s as well as the transformation o f all church propert y into nationa l property ; as a result of which, on April 8, the exclusio n from the schools of all religious symbols , pictures , dogmas , prayers—i n a word, "of all that belong s to the sphere of the individua l conscience" 13—was ordered an d graduall y put into effect.

Marx's The Civil War in France 18 5 incitement t o nationa l hatred .
This was carried out on May 16.
— On Apri l 16 it ordere d a statistica l tabulatio n of factorie s which had been closed down by the manufacturers , and the workin g out of plans for the operatio n of these factorie s by the worker s formerly employe d in them, who were to be organise d in co-operative societies , and also plans for the organisatio n of these co-operatives i n one great union.
—O n the 20th it abolishe d night work for bakers , and also the employmen t offices, which since the Second Empir e had been run as a monopol y by creature s appointed b y the police—labou r exploiter s of the first rank; these offices wer e transferre d to the mayoraltie s of the twenty arrondisse­ ments of Paris.
—O n April 30 it ordere d the closin g of the pawnshops, o n the ground that they were a private exploitatio n of the workers , and were in contradictio n with the right of the workers t o their instrument s of labour and to credit.
—O n May 5 it ordere d the razing of the Chapel of Atonement , which had been built in expiatio n of the executio n of Louis XVI.
Thus fro m Marc h 18 onward s the class characte r of the Paris movement, whic h had previousl y been pushe d into the back-ground b y the fight against the foreign invaders , emerge d sharpl y and clearly .
As almost only workers , or recognise d representative s of the workers , sat in the Commune , its decision s bore a decidedl y proletarian character .
Either these decision s decree d reform s which th e republica n bourgeoisi e had failed to pass solely out of cowardice, bu t which provide d a necessar y basis for the free activity o f the workin g class—suc h as the implementatio n of the principle tha t in relation to the state, religio n is a purely privat e matter—or th e Commun e promulgate d decree s which were in the direct interes t of the workin g class and in part cut deeply into the old orde r of society .
In a beleaguere d city, however , it was possibl e to make at most a start in the realisatio n of all this.
And from the beginning o f May onward s all their energie s were taken up by the fight agains t the armies assemble d by the Versaille s governmen t in ever-growing numbers .
On Apri l 7 the Versaille s troops had capture d the Seine crossin g at Neuilly , on the wester n front of Paris; on the other hand, in an attack, o n the souther n front on the 11th they were repulse d with heavy losse s by Genera l Eudes.
Paris wa s continuall y bombarde d and, moreover , by the very peopl e who had stigmatise d as a sacrilege th e bombardmen t of the same city by the Prussians .
These sam e people now begge d the Prussia n governmen t for the hasty retur n of the French soldier s taken prisone r at Sedan and Metz, in order tha t they might recaptur e Paris for them.
From the beginning o f May the gradua l arrival of these troops gave the Versailles force s a decide d superiority .
This alread y becam e evident when , on April 23, Thiers broke off the negotiation s for the exchange , propose d by the Commune , of the Archbisho p of Paris3 and a whole numbe r of other priests held as hostage s in Paris, for only one man, Blanqui , who had twice been elected to the Commun e but was a prisone r in Clairvaux .
And even more from the change d languag e of Thiers ; previousl y procrastinatin g and equivocal , he now suddenl y becam e insolent , threatening , brutal.
Th e Versaille s forces took the redoub t of Moulin Saquet on the souther n front, on May 3; on the 9th, Fort Issy, which had been completel y reduce d to ruins by gunfire ; on the 14th, Fort Vanves.
O n the wester n front they advance d gradually , capturin g the numerou s villages and building s which extende d up to the city wall, unti l they reache d the main defences ; on the 21st, thanks to treachery an d the carelessnes s of the Nationa l Guards statione d there, the y succeede d in forcin g their way into the city.
The Prussians, wh o held the norther n and easter n forts, allowed the Versailles troop s to advanc e across the land north of the city, which wa s forbidde n groun d to them unde r the armistice , and thus to march forward , attackin g on a wide front, which the Parisians naturall y though t covered by the armistice , and therefor e held onl y weakly .
As a result of this, only a weak resistanc e was put up in the wester n half of Paris, in the luxury city proper ; it grew stronge r and more tenaciou s the nearer the incomin g troops approached th e eastern half, the working-clas s city proper .
It was only afte r eight days' fightin g that the last defender s of the Commune succumbe d on the height s of Bellevill e and Menilmon -tant; an d then the massacr e of defenceles s men, women and children, whic h had been raging all throug h the week on an increasing scale , reache d its zenith.
The breechloader s could no longer kill fast enough ; the vanquishe d were shot down in hundreds b y mitrailleuse fire .
The "Wall of the Federals " at the Père Lachais e cemetery, wher e the final mass murde r was consummated, 162 is still standin g today , a mute but eloquen t testimony t o the frenzy of which the ruling class is capable as soon as the workin g class dares to stand up for its rights.
Then, when the slaughte r of them all proved to be impossible , came the mass arrests, th e shootin g of victim s arbitraril y selecte d from the prisoners' ranks , and the remova l of the rest to great camps where they awaite d trial by courts-martial .

ing the northeaster n half of Paris had orders not to allow any fugitives t o pass; but the officer s often shut their eyes when the soldiers pai d more obedienc e to the dictate s of humanit y than to those of the Suprem e Command ; particula r honou r is due to the Saxon arm y corps, which behave d very humanel y and let throug h many wh o were obviousl y fighter s for the Commune .
If today , after twenty years, we look back at the activity and historical significanc e of the Paris Commun e of 1871, we shall find it necessar y to make a few addition s to the accoun t given in The Civil War in France.
The member s of the Commun e were divide d into a majority , the Blanquists , who had also been predominan t in the Centra l Committee o f the Nationa l Guard ; and a minority , member s of the Internationa l Workin g Men's Association , chiefly consistin g of adherents o f the Proudho n school of socialism .
The great majorit y of the Blanquist s were at that time socialist s only by revolutionary , proletarian instinct ; only a few had attaine d greate r clarity on principles, throug h Vaillant, who wa s familia r with Germa n scientific socialism .
It is therefor e comprehensibl e that in the economic spher e much was left undon e which, accordin g to our view today , the Commun e ought to have done.
The hardes t thing to understan d is certainl y the holy awe with which they remaine d standing respectfull y outsid e the gates of the Bank of France .
This was also a serious politica l mistake .
The bank in the hands of the Commune—this woul d have been worth more than ten thousan d hostages.
I t would have meant the pressur e of the whole of the French bourgeoisi e on the Versaille s governmen t in favour of peace wit h the Commune .
But what is still more wonderfu l is the correctness o f much that nevertheles s was done by the Commune , composed a s it was of Blanquist s and Proudhonists .
Naturally , the Proudhonists wer e chiefly responsibl e for the economi c decree s of the Commune , both for their praiseworth y and their unpraisewor -thy aspects ; as the Blanquist s were for its politica l commission s and omissions.
An d in both cases the irony of history willed — as is usual whe n doctrinaire s come to the helm—tha t both did the opposite o f what the doctrine s of their school prescribed .
Proudhon, th e socialis t of the small peasan t and master -craftsman, regarde d associatio n with positiv e hatred .
He said of it that ther e was more bad than good in it; that it was by nature sterile, eve n harmful , becaus e it was a fetter on the freedom of the worker; tha t it was a pure dogma , unproductiv e and burdensome , in conflic t as much with the freedo m of the worke r as with economy o f labour ; that its disadvantage s multiplie d more swiftly than its advantages ; that, as compare d with it, competition , division o f labour and privat e propert y were economi c forces .
Only in the exceptiona l cases—a s Proudho n called them—o f large-scale industr y and large establishments , such as railways , was the associatio n of worker s in place.
(See General Idea of the Revolution, 3r d sketch.
163) By 1871 , large-scal e industr y had alread y so much ceased to be an exceptiona l case even in Paris, the centre of artistic handicrafts , that by far the most importan t decree of the Commun e institute d an organisatio n of large-scal e industr y and even of manufactur e which wa s not only to be based on the associatio n of the worker s in each factory , but also to combin e all these association s in one great union ; in short, an organisatio n which, as Marx quite rightly says in The Civil War, mus t necessaril y have led in the end to communism,3 tha t is to say, the direct opposit e of the Proudho n doctrine.
And , therefore , the Commun e was the grave of the Proudhon schoo l of socialism .
Today this school has vanishe d from Frenc h working-clas s circles ; here, among the Possibilist s 164 no less than amon g the "Marxists" , Marx's theory now rules unchallenged.
Onl y among the "radical " bourgeoisi e are there still Proudhonists.
The Blanquist s fared no better.
Brough t up in the school of conspiracy, an d held togethe r by the strict disciplin e which went with it, they started out from the viewpoin t that a relativel y small number o f resolute , well-organise d men would be able, at a given favourable moment , not only to seize the helm of state, but also by a display of great, ruthles s energy , to maintai n power until they succeeded i n sweepin g the mass of the people into the revolutio n and rangin g them round the small band of leaders .
This involved , above all , the strictest , dictatoria l centralisatio n of all power in the hands o f the new revolutionar y government .
And what did the Commune, wit h its majorit y of these same Blanquists , actually do? In all its proclamation s to the French in the provinces , it appeale d to them to form a free federatio n of all French Commune s with Paris, a national organisatio n which for the first time was really to be create d by the nation itself.

police, bureaucracy , which Napoleo n had create d in 1798 and which sinc e then had been taken over by every new governmen t as a welcom e instrumen t and used agains t its opponents—i t was precisely thi s power which was to fall everywhere , just as it had already falle n in Paris.
From th e very outset the Commun e was compelle d to recognis e that the workin g class, once come to power , could not go on managing wit h the old state machine ; that in order not to lose again its only just conquere d supremacy , this workin g class must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressiv e machiner y previously use d agains t it itself, and, on the other, safeguar d itself against it s own deputie s and officials , by declarin g them all, without exception , subject to recall at any moment .
What had been the characteristi c attribut e of the former state? Society had create d its own organ s to look after its commo n interests , originall y through simpl e divisio n of labour .
But these organs , at whose head wa s the state power, had in the course of time, in pursuanc e of their own specia l interests , transforme d themselve s from the servants o f society into the master s of society .
This can be seen, for example , not only in the hereditar y monarchy , but equally so in the democrati c republic .
Nowher e do "politicians " form a more separate an d powerfu l section of the nation than precisel y in North America .
There , each of the two major partie s which alternately succee d each other in power is itself in turn controlle d by peopl e who make a business of politics , who speculat e on seats in the legislativ e assemblie s of the Union as well as of the separat e states, or who make a living by carryin g on agitatio n for their party an d on its victory are rewarde d with positions .
It is well known ho w the American s have been trying for thirty years to shake of f this yoke, which has becom e intolerable , and how in spite of it all they continu e to sink ever deeper in this swamp of corruption.
I t is precisel y in Americ a that we see best how there takes plac e this proces s of the state powe r makin g itself independent i n relatio n to society , whose mere instrumen t it was originally intende d to be.
Here there exists no dynasty , no nobility , no standin g army, beyond the few men keepin g watch on the Indians, n o bureaucrac y with permanen t posts or the right to pensions.
An d nevertheles s we find here two great gangs of political speculators , who alternatel y take possessio n of the state power, an d exploi t it by the most corrup t means and for the most corrupt ends—an d the nation is powerles s against these two great cartels o f politicians , who are ostensibl y its servants , but in reality dominate an d plunde r it.
Against thi s transformatio n of the state and the organs of the state from servant s of society into master s of society—a n inevitabl e transformation i n all previou s states—th e Commun e made use of two infallibl e means .
In the first place, it filled all posts— administrative, judicia l and educational—b y electio n on the basis of universa l suffrag e of all concerned , subject to the right of recall at any time by the same electors .
And, in the second place, all officials, hig h or low, were paid only the wages receive d by other workers.
Th e highes t salary paid by the Commun e to anyone was 6,000 francs .
In this way an effectiv e barrier to place-huntin g and careerism wa s set up, even apart from the bindin g mandate s to delegates t o representativ e bodies which were added besides .
This shatterin g [Sprengung] of the former state power and its replacement b y a new and truly democrati c one is describe d in detail in the third section of The Civil War.
Bu t it was necessar y to dwell briefl y here once more on some of its features , becaus e in Germany particularl y the superstitiou s belief in the state has been carried ove r from philosoph y into the genera l consciousnes s of the bourgeoisie an d even of many workers .
Accordin g to the philosophical conception , the state is the "realisatio n of the idea", 3 or the Kingdo m of God on earth, translate d into philosophica l terms, the sphere in which eternal truth and justice is or should be realised.
An d from this follows a superstitiou s reverenc e for the state and everythin g connecte d with it, which takes root the more readily sinc e people are accustome d from childhoo d to imagin e that the affairs and interest s commo n to the whole of society could not be looked after otherwis e than as they have been looked after in the past, that is, through the state and its lucrativel y positione d officials.
An d people think they have taken quite an extraordinari -ly bold step forwar d when they have rid themselve s of belief in hereditary monarch y and swear by the democrati c republic .
In reality, however , the state is nothin g but a machin e for the oppression o f one class by another , and indeed in the democrati c republic n o less than in the monarchy ; and at best an evil inherited b y the proletaria t after its victoriou s struggl e for class supremacy, whos e worst sides the victoriou s proletariat , just like the Commune , cannot avoid having to lop off at once as much as possible unti l such time as a generatio n reared in new, free social conditions i s able to throw the entire lumbe r of the state on the scrap heap .
a This refers to Hegel' s Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts, oder Naturrecht und Staatswissenschaft.

INTRODUCTION [TO KAR L MARX' S WAGE LABOUR AND CAPITAL (189 1 EDITION)] 1 The followin g work appeare d as a series of leading article s in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung from Apri l 4, 1849 onwards .
It is based on the lecture s delivere d by Marx i n 1847 at the Germa n Workers' Societ y in Brussels.
170 The work as printed remaine d a fragment; th e words at the end of No.
269: "To be continued, " remained unfulfille d in consequenc e of the events which just then came crowdin g one after another : the invasio n of Hungar y by the Russians, th e insurrection s in Dresden , Iserlohn, Elberfeld , the Palatinate an d Baden, 171 whic h led to the suppressio n of the newspaper itsel f (May 19, 1849).
The manuscrip t of the continua -tion was not found among Marx's papers after his death.
172 Wage Labour and Capital ha s appeare d in a number of edition s as a separate publicatio n in pamphle t form, the last being in 1884, by the Swiss Co-operativ e Press, Hottingen-Zurich .
The edition s hitherto publishe d retaine d the exact wordin g of the original .
The present ne w edition , however , is to be circulate d in not less than 10,000 copie s as a propagand a pamphlet , and so the questio n could no t but force itself upon me whethe r under these circumstances Mar x himsel f would have approve d of an unaltere d reproduction o f the original .
In the forties, Marx had not yet finished his critique of politica l economy.
Thi s took place only toward s the end of the fifties.
Consequently, hi s works which appeare d before the first part of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859) a differ in some point s from those written after 1859, and contai n expres -sions an d whole sentence s which, from the point of view of the later works , appear unfortunat e and even incorrect .
Now, it is self-evident tha t in ordinar y edition s intende d for the genera l public thi s earlier point of view also has its place, as a part of the intellectual developmen t of the author , and that both author and public hav e an indisputabl e right to the unaltere d reproductio n of a See presen t edition , Vol.

these olde r works.
And I should not have dreame d of alterin g a word of them.
It is anothe r thing when the new edition is intende d practicall y exclusively fo r propagand a among workers .
In such a case Marx would certainl y have brough t the old presentatio n dating from 1849 int o harmon y with his new point of view.
And I feel certain of acting as he would have done in undertakin g for this edition th e few alteration s and addition s which are require d in order to attain this objec t in all essentia l points .
I therefor e tell the reade r beforehand: thi s is not the pamphle t as Marx wrote it in 1849 but approximately a s he would have written it in 1891.
The actual text, moreover , is circulate d in so many copies that this will suffice until I am able to reprin t it again, unaltered , in a later complet e edition.
My alteration s all turn on one point.
Accordin g to the original , the worke r sells his labour t o the capitalis t for wages; accordin g to the presen t text he sells his labour power.
An d for this alteratio n I owe an explanation .
I owe it to the worker s in order that they may see it is not a case here of mere jugglin g with words, but rather of one of the most importan t points in the whole of politica l economy.
I owe it to the bourgeois , so that they can convinc e themselves ho w vastly superio r the uneducate d workers , for whom one can easily make comprehensibl e the most difficul t economi c analyses, ar e to our superciliou s "educate d people " to whom such intricate question s remain insolubl e their whole life long.
Classical politica l econom y took over from industria l practic e the current conceptio n of the manufacturer , that he buys and pays for the labour o f his workers .
This conceptio n had been quite adequate fo r the busines s needs , the book-keepin g and price calculations o f the manufacturer .
But, naively transferre d to political economy , it produce d there really wondrou s errors and confusions.
Political econom y observe s the fact that the prices of all commodities, amon g them also the price of the commodit y that it calls "labour" , are continuall y changing ; that they rise and fall as the resul t of the most varied circumstances , which often bear no relation whateve r to the productio n of the commoditie s them-selves, s o that prices seem, as a rule, to be determine d by pure chance.
A s soon, then, as politica l econom y made its appearanc e as a science , one of its first tasks was to seek the law which was concealed behin d this chance apparentl y governin g the prices of commodities, an d which , in reality , governe d this very chance .
Within th e prices of commodities , continuall y fluctuatin g and oscillating, no w upward s and now downwards , politica l econom y sought fo r the firm centra l point around which these fluctuation s and oscillation s turned .
In a word, it started from the prices o f commodities i n order to look for the value o f the commoditie s as the law controllin g prices , the value by which all fluctuation s in price are to be explaine d and to which finally they are all to be ascribed.
Classical politica l econom y then found that the value of a commodity i s determine d by the labour containe d in it, requisit e for its production .
With this explanatio n it contente d itself.
And we also can pause here for the time being.
I will only remind the reader, i n order to avoid misunderstandings , that this explanatio n has nowaday s becom e totally inadequate .
Marx was the first thoroughly t o investigat e the value-creatin g quality of labour and he discovered i n so doing that not all labour apparently , or even really, necessar y for the productio n of a commodit y adds to it under al l circumstance s a magnitud e of value which correspond s to the quantit y of labour expended .
If therefor e today we say offhandedly wit h economist s like Ricardo that the value of a commodity i s determine d by the labour necessar y for its produc -tion, we always in so doing imply the reservation s made by Marx.
This suffice s here; more is to be found in Marx's A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, 1859 , and the first volum e of Capital.
* But as soon as the economist s applie d this determinatio n of value by labour to the commodit y "labour" , they fell into one contradiction afte r another .
How is the value of "labour " determined? B y the necessar y labour containe d in it.
But how much labou r is containe d in the labour of a worker for a day, a week, a month, a year? The labour of a day, a week, a month, a year.
If labour is the measur e of all values, then indeed we can express th e "value of labour " only in labour .
But we know absolutely nothin g about the value of an hour of labour, if we only know tha t it is equal to an hour of labour .
This brings us not a hair's breadt h nearer the goal; we keep on movin g in a circle.
Classical politica l economy , therefore , tried anothe r tack.
It said: The valu e of a commodit y is equal to its cost of production .
But what is the cost of productio n of labour? In order to answer this question, th e economist s have to tamper a little with logic.
Instead of investigatin g the cost of productio n of labour itself, which a See presen t edition , Vol.

unfortunately canno t be ascertained , they procee d to investigat e the cost of productio n of the worker.
An d this can be ascertained .
It varies with time and circumstance , but for a given state of society, a given locality and a given branch of production , it too is given, at least within fairly narrow limits.
We live today under the domination o f capitalis t production , in which a large, ever-increasing clas s of the populatio n can live only if it works for the owners o f the means of production—th e tools, machines , raw materials an d means of subsistence—i n return for wages.
On the basis of this mode of production , the cost of productio n of the worker consist s of that quantit y of the means of subsistence—o r their pric e in money—which , on the average , is necessar y to make him capabl e of working , keep him capabl e of working , and to replace him , after his departur e by reason of old age, sicknes s or death, wit h a new worker—tha t is to say, to propagat e the working clas s in the necessar y numbers .
Let us assume that the money pric e of these means of subsistenc e average s three marks a day.
Our worker , therefore , receive s a wage of three marks a day from the capitalis t who employ s him.
For this, the capitalis t makes him work , say, twelve hours a day, calculatin g roughl y as follows : Let us assum e that our worker— a machinist—ha s to make a part of a machin e which he can complet e in one day.
The raw material—iron an d brass in the necessar y previousl y prepare d form—costs twent y marks.
The consumptio n of coal by the steam engine, an d the wear and tear of this same engine , of the lathe and the other tools which our worker uses represen t for one day, and reckone d by his share of their use, a value of one mark.
The wage fo r one day, accordin g to our assumption , is three marks .
This make s twenty-fou r marks in all for our machin e part.
But the capitalist calculate s that he will obtain, on an average , twenty-seve n marks fro m his customer s in return , or three marks more than his outlay.
Whence cam e the three marks pockete d by the capitalist ? According t o the assertio n of classica l politica l economy , com-modities are , on the average , sold at their values, that is, at prices corresponding t o the amoun t of necessar y labour containe d in them.
Th e averag e price of our machin e part—twenty-seve n marks—would thu s be equal to its value, that is, equal to the labour embodie d in it.
But of these twenty-seve n marks , twenty -one mark s were values already presen t before our machinis t began work.
Twent y marks were containe d in the raw materials , one mark in the coal consume d during the work, or in the machine s 15-1550 and tool s which were used in the proces s and which were diminished i n their efficienc y to the value of this sum.
There remain si x marks which have been added to the value of the raw material.
Bu t accordin g to the assumptio n of our economist s themselves, thes e six marks can only arise from the labour added to the raw materia l by our worker .
His twelve hours' labour has thus create d a new value of six marks .
The value of his twelve hours' labour would, therefore , be equal to six marks.
And thus we woul d at last have discovere d what the "value of labour " is.
"Hold o n there! " cries our machinist .
"Six marks? But I have received onl y three marks! My capitalis t swears by all that is holy that the value of my twelve hours' labour is only three marks, and if I demand six he laughs at me.
How do you make that out?" If previousl y we got into a vicious circle with our value of labour, w e are now properl y caught in an insolubl e contradiction .
We looke d for the value of labour and we have found more than we can use.
For the worker , the value of the twelve hours' labour is three marks , for the capitalis t it is six marks, of which he pays three to the worker as wages and pocket s three for himself.
Thus labour woul d have not one but two values and very differen t values int o the bargain ! The contradictio n become s still more absurd as soon as we reduce t o labour time the values expresse d in money .
During the twelve hours ' labour a new value of six marks is created .
Hence, in six hour s three marks—th e sum which the worke r receive s for twelve hours ' labour.
For twelve hours' labour the worker receive s as an equivalen t value the produc t of six hours' labour.
Either, therefore, labou r has two values, of which one is double the size of the other , or twelve equals six! In both cases we get pure nonsense.
Turn an d twist as we will, we canno t get out of this contradiction, a s long as we speak of the purchas e and sale of labour an d of the value of labour.
And this also happene d to the economists.
Th e last offshoo t of classica l politica l economy , the Ricardian school , was wrecke d mainly by the insolubilit y of this contradiction.
Classica l politica l econom y had got into a blind alley.
The ma n who found the way out of this blind alley was Karl Marx.
What th e economist s had regarde d as the cost of productio n of "labour" wa s the cost of productio n not of labour but of the living worker himself.
And what this worker sold to the capitalis t was not his labour .
*As soon as his labour actually begins, " says Marx, "it has alread y ceased to belong to him; it can therefor e no longer be sold by him.
" a At the most, he might sell his future labour , that is, undertake t o perfor m a certain amoun t of work in a definite time.
In so doing, however , he does not sell labour (which would first have to be performed ) but puts his labour power at the disposa l of the capitalis t for a definite time (in the case of time-work ) or for the purpos e of a definite outpu t (in the case of piece-work ) in return fo r a definite payment : he hires out, or sells, his labour power.
Bu t this labour power is intergrow n with his person and is inseparable fro m it.
Its cost of production , therefore , coincide s with his cost of production ; what the economist s called the cost of production o f labour is really the cost of productio n of the worker and therewit h of his labour power.
And so we can go back from the cost of productio n of labour power to the value o f labour power an d determin e the amoun t of sociall y necessar y labou r requisite fo r the productio n of labour power of a particula r quality, a s Marx has done in the chapte r on the buying and selling of labou r power (Capital, Vol .
I, Chapte r IV, Section 3).
b Now wha t happen s after the worke r has sold his labour power to the capitalist , that is, placed it at the disposa l of the latter in return fo r a wage—da y wage or piece wage—agree d upon beforehand? Th e capitalis t takes the worke r into his worksho p or factory, wher e all the things necessar y for work — raw materials , auxiliary material s (coal, dyes, etc.
), tools, machines—ar e alread y to be found.
Here the worke r begins to drudge .
His daily wage may be, as above, three marks—an d in this connectio n it does not make an y differenc e whethe r he earns it as day wage or piece wage.
Her e also we again assum e that in the twelve hours the worker b y his labour adds a new value of six marks to the raw materials use d up, which new value the capitalis t realises on the sale of the finishe d piece of work.
Out of this he pays the worke r his three marks ; the other three marks he keeps for himself .
If, now, the worker creates a value of six marks in twelve hours, then in six hours he creates a value of three marks.
He has, therefore , already repai d the capitalis t the counter-valu e of the three marks contained i n his wages when he has worked six hours for him.
After six hours' labour they are both quits, neither owes the other a pfennig .
"Hold o n there! " the capitalis t now cries.
"I have hired the worker fo r a whole day, for twelve hours.
Six hours, however , are only half a day.
So go right on workin g until the other six hours a Engels quotes fro m K.

15* are up—onl y then shall we be quits!" And, in fact, the worker has to compl y with his contrac t "voluntarily " entere d into, accordin g to which he has pledge d himsel f to work twelve whole hours for a labour produc t which costs six hours of labour .
It is just the same with piece wages.
Let us assume that our worker make s twelve items of a commodit y in twelve hours.
Each of these costs two marks in raw material s and depreciatio n and is sold at two and a half marks .
Then the capitalist , on the same assumptions a s before , will give the worke r twenty-fiv e pfennig s per item ; that makes three marks for twelve items, to earn which the worke r needs twelve hours.
The capitalis t receive s thirty marks for the twelve items; deduct twenty-fou r marks for raw material s and depreciatio n and there remain six marks , of which he pays three mark s to the worker in wages and pocket s three marks.
It is just as above.
Here, too, the worker works six hours for himself , that is, for replacemen t of his wages (half an hour in each of the twelve hours ) and six hours for the capitalist .
The difficult y over which the best economist s came to grief, so long as they started out from the value of "labour" , vanishe s as soon as we start out from the value of "labou r power" instead .
In our present-da y capitalis t society , labour power is a commodity , a commodity lik e any other, and yet quite a peculiar commodity .
It has, namely , the peculia r propert y of being a value-creatin g power, a source of value and, indeed , with suitabl e treatment , a source o f more value than it itself possesses .
With the presen t state of production , human labour power not only produce s in one day a greate r value than it itself possesse s and costs; with every new scientific discovery , with every new technica l invention , this surplus o f its daily produc t over its daily cost increases , and therefore tha t portio n of the labour day in which the worke r works to produc e the replacemen t of his day's wage decreases ; consequently, o n the other hand, that portion of the labour day in which h e has to make a present o f his labour to the capitalis t without bein g paid for it increases .
And thi s is the economi c constitutio n of the whole of our present-day society : it is the workin g class alone which produce s all values.
Fo r value is only anothe r expressio n for labour , that expression whereb y in our present-da y capitalis t society is desig-nated th e amoun t of sociall y necessar y labou r containe d in a particular commodity .
These values produce d by the worker s do not, however , belong to the workers .
They belong to the owners of the raw materials , machines , tools and the reserv e funds which allow thes e owners to buy the labour power of the workin g class.
From th e whole mass of product s produce d by it, the workin g class, therefore , receive s back only a part for itself.
And as we have jus t seen, the other part, which the capitalis t class keeps for itself an d at most has to divide with the class of landowners , becomes large r with every new discover y and invention , while the part fallin g to the share of the workin g class (reckone d per head) either increase s only very slowly and inconsiderabl y or not at all, and unde r certain circumstance s may even fall.
But thes e discoverie s and invention s which supersed e each other at an ever-increasin g rate, this productivit y of human labour which rises day by day to an extent previousl y unhear d of, finally give rise to a conflict in which the present-da y capitalis t econom y must perish.
O n the one hand are immeasurabl e riches and a superfluity o f product s which the purchaser s cannot cope with; on the othe r hand, the great mass of society proletarianised , turned into wage-workers , and precisel y for that reason made incapabl e of appropriatin g for themselve s this superfluit y of products .
The division o f society into a small, excessivel y rich class and a large, propertyless clas s of wage-worker s results in a society suffocatin g from its own superfluity , while the great majorit y of its member s is scarcely , or even not at all, protecte d from extrem e want.
This state of affairs become s daily more absurd and—mor e unneces -sary.
It must b e abolished , it can be abolished .
A new social order is possibl e in which the presen t class difference s will have disappeared an d in which—perhap s after a short transitiona l period involvin g some privation , but at any rate of great value morally—through th e planne d utilisatio n and extensio n of the already existin g enormou s productiv e forces of all member s of society, an d with unifor m obligatio n to work, the means for existence, fo r enjoyin g life, for the developmen t and employmen t of all bodily and menta l facultie s will be availabl e in an equal measure an d in ever-increasin g fulness .
And that the worker s are becoming mor e and more determine d to win this new social order will be demonstrate d on both sides of the ocean by May the First, tomorrow, an d by Sunday , May 3.

A French translatio n by Henri Rave based on the presen t German editio n is in the press.
a Until the beginnin g of the sixties there was no such thing as a history o f the family .
In this sphere historica l science was still completely unde r the influenc e of the Five Books of Moses.
The patriarchal for m of the family, describe d there in greater detail than anywhere else , was not only implicitl y accepte d as the oldest form of the family , but also—afte r excludin g polygamy—identifie d with the present-day bourgeoi s family, as if the family had really undergon e no historica l developmen t at all.
At most it was admitte d that a period o f promiscuou s sexual relationship s might have existed in primeval times.
—T o be sure, in additio n to monogamy , Orienta l polygamy an d Indo-Tibeta n polyandr y were also known , but these three form s could not be arrange d in any historica l sequenc e and appeared disconnectedl y alongsid e of each other.
That among certain people s of ancien t times, and among some still existin g savages, th e line of descen t was reckone d not from the father but from th e mothe r and, therefore , the female lineag e alone was regarded a s valid; that among many people s of today marriag e within definit e larger groups—no t subjecte d to closer investigatio n at that time—i s prohibited , and that this custom is to be met with in all parts of the world—thes e facts were indeed known and new examples wer e constantl y being brough t to light.
But nobody knew what to do with them, and even in E.

against th e touchin g of burnin g wood with iron tools, and similar religious bos h and nonsense .
The stud y of the history of the family dates from 1861, from the publication o f Bachofen' s Das Mutterrecht.
I n this work the author advances th e followin g propositions : 1) that in the beginnin g humanity live d in a state of sexual promiscuity , which the author unhappily designate s as hetaerism ; 2) that such promiscuit y excludes al l certaint y as regard s paternity , that lineage , therefore , could be reckone d only throug h the female line—accordin g to mother right—an d that originall y this was the case among all the peoples o f antiquity ; 3) that consequentl y women , who, as mothers , were th e only definitel y ascertainabl e parent s of the younge r generation, wer e treated with a high degree of consideratio n and respect, which , accordin g to Bachofen' s conception , was enhance d to the complet e rule of women (gynaecocracy) ; 4) that the transitio n to monogamy, wher e the woma n belong s exclusivel y to one man , implied th e violatio n of a primeva l religiou s injunctio n (that is, in actual fact , the violatio n of the ancien t traditiona l right of the other men to the same woman) , a violation which had to be atoned for, or the toleratio n of which had to be purchased , by surrenderin g the woman fo r a limited period of time.
Bachofen finds evidenc e in suppor t of these proposition s in countless passage s of ancien t classica l literature , which he had assembled wit h extraordinar y diligence .
Accordin g to him, the evolution fro m "hetaerism " to monogamy , and from mothe r right to father right , takes place, particularl y amon g the Greeks , as a consequence o f the evolutio n of religiou s ideas, the intrusio n of new deities, representative s of the new outlook , into the old traditiona l pantheon representin g the old outlook , so that the latter is more and more drive n into the backgroun d by the former .
Thus, accordin g to Bachofen, it is not the developmen t of the actual condition s under which me n live, but the religiou s reflectio n of these condition s of life in the minds of men that brough t about the historica l change s in the mutual socia l positio n of man and woman .
Bachofen accordingly points to the Oresteia o f Aeschylu s as a dramati c depictio n of the struggle betwee n declinin g mothe r right and rising and victoriou s father righ t in the Heroic Age.
Clytemnestr a has slain her husban d Agamemnon, jus t return from the Trojan War, for the sake of her lover Aegisthus ; but Orestes , her son by Agamemnon , avenge s his father's murde r by slaying his mother .
For this he is pursue d by the Erinyes, th e demoni c defender s of mother right, accordin g to which matricide i s the most heinou s and inexpiabl e of crimes.
But Apollo, who throug h his oracle has incited Oreste s to commi t this deed, and Athena, wh o is called in as arbiter—th e two deities which here represent th e new order , based on father right—protec t him.
Athena hear s both sides.
The whole controvers y is briefly summarised i n the debate which now ensues betwee n Oreste s and the Erinyes .
Orestes declare s that Clytemnestr a is guilty of a double outrage; fo r in killing her husban d she also killed his father .
Why then hav e the Erinye s persecute d him and not Clytemnestra , who is much th e greate r culprit ? The reply is striking : "Unrelated by blood wa s she to the man that she slew.
" 3 The murde r of a man not related by blood, even though he be the husband o f the murderess , is expiable and does not concer n the Erinyes.
Thei r functio n is to aveng e only murder s amon g blood-relatives, an d the most heinou s of all these, accordin g to mother right , is matricide .
Apollo now intervene s in defens e of Orestes.
Athen a calls upon the Areopagites—th e Athenia n jurors — to vote on the question .
The votes for acquitta l and for the convictio n are equal .
Then Athena , as Presiden t of the Court, casts her vote in favour o f Orestes and acquits him.
Father right has gained the day over mothe r right.
The "gods of junior lineage" , as they are described b y the Erinyes themselves , are victoriou s over the Erinyes , and the latter allow themselve s finally to be persuade d to assume a new offic e in the service of the new order .
This new but absolutel y correc t interpretatio n of the Oresteia i s one of the best and most beautifu l passage s in the whole book, but it shows at the same time that Bachofen himself believe s in the Erinyes , Apollo an d Athena at least as much as Aeschylu s did in his day; he, in fact, believe s that in the Heroic Age of Greece they performe d the miracle o f overthrowin g mothe r right and replacin g it by father right.
Clearly , such a conception—whic h regard s religio n as the decisive leve r in world history—mus t finally end in sheer mysticism .
It is, therefore , an arduou s and by no means always profitabl e task to wade throug h Bachofen' s bulky quarto volume .
But all this does not detract fro m his merit as a pioneer, for he was the first to substitut e for mer e phrase s about an unknow n primitiv e conditio n of promiscuous sexua l intercours e proof that ancient classica l literatur e teems wit h traces of a conditio n that had in fact existed before monogamy amon g the Greeks and the Asiatics , in which not only a man had sexual intercours e with more than one woman , but a woman ha d sexual intercours e with more than one man, withou t a Aeschylus , Oresteia.
Eumenides.
— Ed violating th e establishe d custom ; that this custom did not disappea r without leavin g traces in the form of the limited surrende r by which women wer e compelle d to purchas e their right to monogamia n marriage; tha t descent , therefore , could originall y be reckone d only in the female line, from mothe r to mother , that this exclusiv e validity of the female line persiste d far into the time of monogam y with assured, o r at least recognised , paternity ; and that this origina l position o f the mothe r as the sole certain parent of her childre n assured her , and thus women in general , a higher social status than they hav e ever enjoye d since.
Bachofen did not expres s these propositions a s clearly as this—hi s mystica l outlook prevente d him from doin g so; but he proved that they were correct , and this, in 1861, meant a complet e revolution .
Bachofen's bulk y tome was written in German , that is, in the language o f the nation which, at that time, intereste d itself less than any othe r in the prehistor y of the present-da y family.
He, therefore , remained unknown .
His immediat e successo r in this field appeare d in 1865, withou t ever having heard of Bachofen.
This successo r was J.
F.
McLennan , the direct opposit e of his predecessor.
Instea d of the talente d mystic , we have here the dry-as-dust lawyer ; instead of exuberan t poetic fancy, we have the plausible argument s of the advocat e pleadin g his case.
McLenna n finds amon g many savage , barbaria n and even civilise d people s of ancient an d moder n times a form of marriag e in which the bridegroom, alon e or accompanie d by friends , has to feign to carry off the bride from her relative s by force.
This custom must be the survival o f a previous custom , whereb y the men of one tribe acquire d their wive s from outside , from other tribes, by actuall y abductin g them by force.
How then did this "marriag e by abduction " originate? A s long as men could find sufficien t women in their own tribe ther e was no occasio n for it whatsoever .
But quite as often we find that among undevelope d people s certain groups exist (which round abou t 1865 were still often identifie d with the tribes themselves) withi n which marriag e is forbidden , so that the men are obliged t o secure their wives, and the women their husbands , from outside th e group; while among others the custom prevail s that the men of a certain group are compelle d to find their wives only within their own group.
McLenna n calls the first type of group exogamous , and the second endogamous , and withou t further ado establishe s a rigid antithesi s betwee n exogamou s and endogamou s "tribes" .
And although hi s own researche s into exogam y bring under his very nose the fact that in many, if not most, or even all cases this antithesi s exists onl y in his own imagination , he nevertheles s makes it the foundation o f his entire theory.
Accordingly , exogamou s tribes may procure thei r wives only from other tribes; and in the state of permanent intertriba l warfare that is characteristi c of savagery , this, he believes , could be done only by abduction .
McLennan argue s further : Whenc e this custom of exogamy ? The conception s of consanguinit y and incest have nothin g to do with it, for these are things which develope d only much later.
But the custom , widesprea d among savages , of killing female childre n immediately afte r birth, might.
This custom create d a superfluit y of men in each individua l tribe, the necessar y and immediat e sequel o f which was the commo n possessio n of a woman by a number o f men — polyandry .
The consequenc e of this again was that the mothe r of a child was known , but the father was not, hence kinshi p was reckone d only in the femal e line to the exclusion o f the male—mothe r right.
And anothe r consequenc e of the deart h of women within a tribe—a dearth mitigate d but not overcome b y polyandry—wa s precisel y the systematic , forcibl e abduction o f women of other tribes.
* ".
.
.
As exogam y and polyandr y are referabl e to one and the same cause— a want of balanc e betwee n the sexes—w e are forced to regard all the exogamous races as having originally been polyandrous.
.
.
.
* Therefore , we must hold it to be beyon d dispute tha t among exogamou s races the first system of kinship was that which recognized blood-tie s throug h mother s only.
" * (McLennan , Studies in Ancient History, 1886 , "Primitiv e Marriage" , p.
124.
) McLennan's meri t lies in having drawn attentio n to the genera l prevalence an d great importanc e of what he terms exogamy .
But he by no means discovered th e existenc e of exogamou s groups , and still less did he understan d it.
Apart from the earlier , isolate d notes of many observer s which served as McLennan' s sources , Latham (Descriptive Ethnology, 1859 ) exactly and correctl y describe d this institutio n among the Indian Magars 178 and declare d that it was generall y prevalen t and existed in all parts of the world— a passage whic h McLenna n himsel f quotes .
And our Morgan , too, as far back as 1847, in his letters on the Iroquoi s (in the American Review), and in 1851 in The League of the Iroquois prove d that it existed i n this tribe, and describe d it correctly , whereas , as we shall see, McLennan' s lawyer mentalit y caused far greater confusio n on this subjec t than Bachofen' s mystica l fantasy did in the sphere of mother right .
It is also to McLennan' s credit that he recognise d the syste m of tracing descen t throug h mother s as the origina l one, although, a s he himsel f admitte d later, Bachofen anticipated hi m a Engels' italics.
— Ed in this.
But here again he is far from clear; he speaks continuall y of "KINSHI P THROUG H FEMALES ONLY" and constantl y applie s this expres -sion—correct fo r an earlie r stage—als o to later stages of development, where , althoug h descen t and inheritanc e are still exclusively reckone d in the female line, kinship is also recognise d and expresse d in the male line.
This is the restricte d outloo k of the jurist , who creates a rigid legal term for himself and continue s to apply it withou t modificatio n to condition s which in the meantime hav e rendere d it inapplicable .
In spite of its plausibility , McLennan' s theory evidentl y did not seem to be too well founde d even to the author himself.
At least, he himsel f is struck by the fact that * "it is observabl e that the form of" (mock ) "captur e is now most distinctl y marked an d impressiv e just among those races which have malea kinship " * (meaning descen t throug h the male line) (p.
140).
And, again : * "It is a curious fact that nowher e now, that we are aware of, is infanticid e a systemP wher e exogam y and the earlies t form of kinship co-exist " * (p.
146).
Both thes e facts directl y refute his interpretation , and he can oppose t o them only new, still more intricate , hypotheses .
Nevertheless, i n Englan d his theory met with great approbatio n and evoke d great response .
McLenna n was generall y accepte d there as the founde r of the history of the family , and the most eminent authorit y in this field.
His antithesi s betwee n exogamou s and endogamou s "tribes" , notwithstandin g the few exception s and modifications admitted , remaine d nevertheles s the recognise d foundation o f the prevailin g view, and was the blinker which made any free survey of the field under investigatio n and, consequently , any definit e progress , impossible .
The overratin g of McLennan , which becam e the vogue in Englan d and, followin g the Englis h fashion, elsewher e as well, makes it a duty to point out in contras t that the harm he caused with his completel y erroneou s antithesi s between exogamou s and endogamou s "tribes " outweigh s the good done by his researches .
Meanwhile, mor e and more facts soon came to light, which did not fit into his neat scheme .
McLenna n knew only three forms of marriage—polygamy, polyandr y and monogamy .
But once atten-tion had been directe d to this point, more and more proofs were discovered o f the fact that among undevelope d people s forms of marriage existe d in which a group of men possesse d a group of a Engels' italics.

women i n common ; and Lubbock (The Origin of Civilisation, 1870 ) acknowledged thi s COMMUNA L MARRIAG E to be a historica l fact.
Immediately after , in 1871, Morgan appeare d with new and, in many respects , conclusiv e material .
He had becom e convince d that the peculia r system of kinship prevailin g among the Iroquoi s was common t o all the aborigine s of the United States and was thus spread ove r a whole continent , althoug h it conflicte d directl y with the degree s of kinship actuall y arising from the connubia l system in force there.
He thereupo n prevaile d on the America n Federa l Government t o collect informatio n about the kinshi p system s of the othe r peoples , on the basis of questionnaire s and tables drawn up by himself ; and he discovere d from the answers : 1) that the American India n system of kinship prevaile d also among numer -ous tribe s in Asia, and, in a somewha t modifie d form, in .
Africa and Australia ; 2) that it was completel y explaine d by a form of group marriage , now approachin g extinction , in Hawai i and in other Australia n islands ; and 3) that, however , alongsid e this marriage form , a system of kinship prevaile d in these same islands which coul d only be explaine d by a still earlier but now extinc t form of group marriage .
He publishe d the collecte d data and his conclusions fro m them in his Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity, 1871, and thereb y carried the discussio n on to an infinitel y wider field.
Takin g the system s of kinshi p as his starting-point , he reconstructed th e forms of the family correspondin g to them, and thereby opene d up a new avenu e of investigatio n and a more far-reaching retrospec t into the prehistor y of mankind .
Were this method t o be recognise d as valid, McLennan' s neat constructio n would b e resolve d into thin air.
McLennan defende d his theory in a new editio n of "Primitiv e Marriage" (Studies in Ancient History, 1876) .
While he himself very artificially construct s a history of the family out of sheer hypotheses, h e demand s of Lubboc k and Morga n not only proofs for ever y one of their statements , but proofs of incontestabl e validity suc h as alone would be admitte d in a Scottish court of law.
And thi s is done by the man who, from the close relationshi p between one' s mother' s brothe r and one's sister's son among the Germans (Tacitus , Germania, c .
20), from Caesar' s report that the Britons i n group s of ten or twelve possesse d their wives in common, 3 and from all the other report s of ancien t writer s concerning communit y of wome n amon g the barbarians , un-hesitatingly conclude s that polyandr y was the rule among all these a Caesar , Gallic War, V , XIV.
— Ed.
211 peoples! I t is like listenin g to counse l for the prosecution , who permits himsel f every licens e in preparin g his own case, but demands th e most formal and legally most valid proof for every word of counse l for the defence .
Group marriag e is a pure figmen t of the imagination , he asserts , and thu s falls back far behind Bachofen.
Morgan's system s of kinship, h e says, are nothin g more than mere precept s on social politeness, prove d by the fact that the Indian s also addres s strangers, whit e men, as brother , or father.
It is as if one were to argue tha t the terms father, mother , brother , sister are merely empty form s of addres s becaus e Catholi c priests and abbesse s are likewise addresse d as father and mother , and becaus e monks and nuns, and even freemason s and member s of English craft unions , in solem n session assembled , are addresse d as brothe r and sister.
In short , McLennan' s defenc e was miserabl y weak.
One point , however , remaine d on which he had not been challenged.
Th e antithesi s betwee n exogamou s and endogamou s "tribes" on which his whole system was founde d not only remained unshaken , but was even generall y accepte d as the cornerstone o f the entire history of the family .
It was admitte d that McLennan' s attemp t to explain this antithesi s was inadequat e and contradicte d the very facts he himsel f had enumerated .
But the antithesi s itself, the existenc e of two mutuall y exclusiv e types of separat e and independen t tribes, one of which took its wives from withi n the tribe, while this was absolutel y forbidde n to the other—this passe d as incontrovertibl e gospel truth.
Compare , for example, Giraud-Teulon' s Origines de la famille (1874) an d even Lubbock's Origin of Civilisation (Fourt h edition , 1882).
This is the point at which Morgan' s chief work enters : Ancient Society (1877) , the book upon which the presen t work is based.
What Morga n only dimly surmise d in 1871 is here develope d with full comprehension .
Endogam y and exogam y constitut e no an-tithesis; u p to the presen t no exogamou s "tribes " have been brought t o light anywhere .
But at the time when group marriag e still prevailed—an d in all probabilit y it existed everywher e at one time or other—th e tribe consiste d of a number of groups related by blood on the mother' s side, gentes, within which marriag e was strictly prohibited , so that althoug h the men of a gens could, and as a rule did, take their wives from within their tribe, they had, however, t o take them from outsid e their gens.
Thus, while the gens itsel f was strictly exogamous , the tribe, embracin g all the gentes, wa s as strictly endogamous .
With this, the last remnant s of McLennan's artificia l structur e definitel y collapsed .
Morgan, however , did not rest conten t with this.
The gens of the America n Indian s served him furthe r as a means of makin g the secon d decisiv e advanc e in the field of investigatio n he had entered upon .
He discovere d that the gens, organise d accordin g to mother right , was the origina l form out of which develope d the later gens , organise d accordin g to father right, the gens as we find it among the civilise d people s of antiquity .
The Greek and Roman gens, an enigm a to all previou s historians , was now explaine d by the India n gens, and thus a new basis was found for the whole history o f primitiv e society .
The rediscover y of the origina l mother-righ t gens as the stage preliminary t o the father-righ t gens of the civilise d people s has the same significanc e for the history of primitiv e society as Darwin' s theory o f evolutio n has for biology , and Marx's theory of surplu s value fo r politica l economy .
It enabled Morga n to outline for the first tim e a history of the family , wherei n at least the classica l stages of developmen t are, on the whole, provisionall y established , as far as the materia l at presen t availabl e permits .
Clearly , this opens a new era in the treatmen t of the history of primitiv e society.
Th e mother-righ t gens has become the pivot around which this entir e scienc e turns; since its discover y we know in which direction t o conduc t our researches , what to investigat e and how to classif y the results of our investigations .
As a consequence , progress i n this field is now much more rapid than befor e Morgan's boo k appeared .
Morgan's discoverie s are now generall y recognised , or rather appropriated, b y prehistorian s in England , too.
But scarcely one of them wil l openly acknowledg e that it is to Morga n that we owe this revolution i n outlook .
In Englan d his book is hushed up as far as possible, an d Morga n himsel f is dismisse d with condescendin g praise fo r his previous work ; the details of his expositio n are eagerly picke d on for criticism , while an obstinat e silence reigns with regar d to his really great discoveries .
The origina l edition of Ancient Society i s now out of print; in Americ a there is no profitable marke t for books of this sort; in England , it would seem, th e book was systematicall y suppressed , and the only edition of this epoch-makin g work still availabl e in the book trade is—th e German translation .
Whence thi s reserve , which it is difficul t not to regard as a conspiracy o f silence , particularl y in view of the host of quotation s given merel y for politeness ' sake and of other evidence s of camaraderie, i n which the writing s of our recognise d prehistorian s abound? I s it perhaps becaus e Morga n is an American , and it is very har d for Englis h prehistorians , despite their highly com-mendable diligenc e in the collectio n of material , to have to depen d for the genera l viewpoin t which determine s the arrangemen t and grouping o f this material , in short, for their ideas, upon two talented foreigners— Bachofen and Morgan ? A German might be tolerated, bu t an American ? Every Englishma n waxes patrioti c when face d with an American , amusin g example s of which I have come acros s while I was in the United States.
179 To this must be added tha t McLenna n was, so to speak, the officiall y proclaime d founder an d leader of the English prehistori c school ; that it was, in a sense, good form amon g prehistorian s to refer only with the greatest reverenc e to his artificiall y constructe d historica l theory leading fro m infanticide , throug h polyandr y and marriag e by abduction, t o the mother-righ t family; that the slightes t doubt cast upon th e existenc e of mutuall y wholly exclusiv e exogamou s and endogamous "tribes " was regarde d as rank heresy ; so that Morgan, i n thus resolvin g all these hallowe d dogma s into thin air, was guilt y of a kind of sacrilege .
Moreover , he resolve d them in such a way that he had only to state his case for it to becom e obvious a t once; and the McLenna n worshippers , hithert o confusedly staggerin g about betwee n exogam y and endogamy , were almos t driven to beatin g their forehead s and exclaiming : How coul d we have been so stupid as not to have discovere d all this for ourselve s long ago! And, as though this were not crime enoug h to prohibi t the official schoo l from treatin g him with anythin g else but cold indifference, Morga n filled the cup to overflowin g not only by criticising civilisation , the society of commodit y production , the basic for m of our present-da y society , after a fashion reminiscen t of Fourier , but also by speakin g of a future transformatio n of society i n words which Karl Marx might have used.
He receive d his deserts , therefore , when McLenna n indignantl y charge d him with havin g "a profoun d antipath y to the historica l method", 3 and when Professo r Giraud-Teulo n endorse d this view in Genev a as late as 1884.
Was it not this same M.
Giraud-Teulon , who, in 1874 (Origines de la famille), was still wanderin g helplessl y in the maze of McLennan' s exogamy , from which it took Morga n to liberat e him? It is not necessar y for me to deal here with the other advance s which th e history of primitiv e society owes to Morgan ; a referenc e to what is needed will be found in the course of this book.

16-1550 the fourtee n years that have elapse d since the publicatio n of his chief wor k our materia l relating to the history of primitiv e human societies ha s been greatly augmented .

[MESSAGE OF GREETING S TO THE SECON D AUSTRIA N PART Y CONGRESS] 1 London, Jun e 26, 1891 Dear Comrades , Please accep t my warmes t thanks for your kind invitatio n to the Second Part y Congres s of the Austria n Social Democrats , and at the sam e time my regret that I shall not be able to attend in person; m y best wishes for the successfu l cours e of your deliberations.
Since Hainfeld, 181 when the Austria n workers ' party found its feet again , you have made enormou s progress .
This is the best guarantee tha t your presen t Congres s will be the starting point for new and even more importan t victories .
The invincibl e inner strengt h possesse d by our party is proved not only by its successe s followin g swiftly one upon another , not only by the fact that it, as last year in Germany , has this year overcome th e state of emergenc y in Austria.
182 It shows its strength fa r more by conquerin g obstacle s in all countries , and accomplishing thing s where the other parties , recruite d from the propertied classes , come helplessl y to a halt.
While the propertie d classes o f France and German y feud with irreconcilabl e hatred , French an d Germa n proletarian s work hand in hand.
And while, around yo u in Austria , the propertie d classes of the various crown lands los e the last remnant s of the ability to rule in their blind national discord , your Secon d Party Congres s will display the picture o f an Austri a which no longer knows nationa l discord — the Austri a of the workers .

193 6 The presen t draft 184 differ s very favourabl y from the forme r programme.
185 Th e strong survival s of outmode d traditions—bot h the specifi c Lassallea n and vulgar socialistic—hav e in the main been removed , and as regard s its theoretica l aspect the draft is, on the whole , based on present-da y science and can be discusse d on this basis .
It is divided into three sections : I.
The Preamble , II.
Politica l Demands, III .
Demand s for Measure s of Protectio n for the Workers.
I.
PREAMBL E IN TEN PARAGRAPH S In genera l it suffers from the attemp t to combin e two things that are uncombinable : a programm e and a commentary o n the programme a s well.
The fear that a short, pointe d expositio n would no t be intelligibl e enough , has caused explanation s to be added, whic h make it verbos e and drawn out.
To my view the programme shoul d be as short and precise as possible .
No harm is done eve n if it contain s the occasiona l foreign word, or a sentenc e whose ful l significanc e cannot be understoo d at first sight.
Verbal exposition a t meeting s and written commentarie s in the press take care of all that, and the short, precise phrase , once understood , takes roo t in the memory , and become s a slogan, a thing that never happen s with verbos e explanations .
Too much should not be sacrifice d for the sake of popularity , and the mental ability and educational leve l of our worker s should not be underestimated .
They hav e understoo d much more difficul t things than the shortest, mos t concise programm e can offer them; and if the period o f the Anti-Socialis t Law 186 has made more difficult , and here and there even prevente d the spreadin g of comprehensiv e knowledge amon g the masses joining the movement , now that our propagandist literatur e can again be kept and read withou t risking trouble, los t time will soon be made up for under the old leadership.
I shall try to make this entire section somewha t shorter and if I succeed shal l enclose it or send it on later.
Now, I shall deal with the individua l paragraph s numbere d from 1 to 10.
Paragraph 1.
"The separation," etc.
, "mines , pits, quarries " — three word s for the same thing; two should be deleted .
I would leave mines (Bergwerke), which is a word used even in the most level part s of the country , and I would designat e them all by this widely use d term.
I would, however , add "railways and other mean s of communication" .
Paragraph 2.
Her e I would insert : "In the hands of their appropriators (o r their owners) th e social mean s of labour are" and likewise belo w "dependenc e .
.
.
on the owners (o r appropriators ) of the mean s of labour" , etc.
It has already been said in para.
1 that these gentleme n have appropriated thes e things as "exclusive possession " and will simply need to be repeate d here if one absolutel y insists on introducin g the word "monopolists" .
Neithe r this nor the other word adds anything t o the sense.
And anythin g redundan t in a programm e weakens it .
"The mean s of labour necessary fo r the existence o f society " — these are precisel y those that are at hand.
Before the steam engine i t was possibl e to do withou t it, now we couldn't .
Since all the mean s of labour are nowaday s directly or indirectly—eithe r by their desig n or becaus e of the social divisio n of labour— social means of labour, thes e words express what is availabl e at every given moment sufficientl y clearly , correctl y and withou t any misleadin g associations.
If this conclusio n is intende d to correspon d with the preambl e of the Rules of the International , I should prefer it to correspon d completely: "t o social misery " (this is No.
1), "menta l degradatio n and politica l dependence".
3 Physica l degradatio n is part of social misery an d politica l dependence i s a fact, while the denial of political a K.

3.
— Ed.
First pag e of F.
Engels ' manuscript A Critique of the Draft Social-Democratic Programme of 1891 rights is a declamator y phrase which is only relatively tru e and for this reaso n does not belong in the programme .
Paragraph 3.
I n my opinio n the first sentenc e shoul d be changed.
"Under th e domination o f the individual owners.
" First of all that which follows is an economi c fact, which should be explaine d in economi c terms.
The expressio n "domination o f the individua l owners " creates the false impressio n that this has been cause d by the political dominatio n of that gang of robbers .
Secondly, thes e individua l owners include not only "capitalist s and big landowners " (what does the "bourgeoisie " followin g here signify? Ar e they a third class of individua l owners ? Are the big landowners als o "bourgeois" ? And, once we have turned to the subject o f big landowners , should we ignore the colossa l survival s of feudalism , which give the whole filthy busines s of Germa n politics it s specifi c reactionar y character?) .
Peasants an d petty bourgeois to o are "individua l owners" , at least they still are today; but they do not appear anywher e in the programm e and therefor e the wordin g should make it clear that they are not include d in the category o f individua l owners under discussion .
"The accumulatio n of the means of labour and of the wealth that has been created b y the exploited.
" The "wealth " consist s of 1.
means of labour , 2.
means of subsistence.
I t is therefor e grammaticall y incorrec t and illogica l to mention on e part o f the wealth withou t the other and then refer to the total wealth , linking the two by and.
".

.
increases .
.
.
in the hands of the capitalists wit h growin g speed" .
What ha s happene d to the "big landowners " and the "bourgeoisie" mentione d above? If it is enough to speak only of capitalists here , it should be so above as well.
If one wishes to specify, however , it is generall y not enoug h to mentio n them alone.
"The numbe r and the misery o f the proletaria t increas e continuously.
" This is incorrec t when put in such a categorica l way.
The organisation o f the worker s and their constantl y growin g resis-tance wil l possibly check the increase of misery t o a certain extent .
However, wha t certainly doe s increas e is the insecurity of existence.
I should inser t this.
Paragraph 4.
"The planlessnes s rooted in the nature of capitalis t private production " needs considerabl e improvement .
I am familia r with capitalis t production a s a social form, or an economi c phase ; capitalis t private productio n being a phenomenon whic h in one form or another i s encountere d in that phase.
What is capitalis t private production? Productio n by separate entrepreneurs , which is increasingly becomin g an exception .
Capitalis t productio n by joint-stock companies i s no longer private productio n but productio n on behal f of many associate d people .
And when we pass on from joint-stock companie s to trusts, which dominat e and monopolis e whole branche s of industry , this puts an end not only to private production bu t also to planlessness.
I f the word "private" wer e deleted th e sentenc e could pass.
"The rui n of broad layers of the population.
" Instead o f this declamator y phrase , which looks as though we still regre t the ruin of the bourgeoi s and petty bourgeois , I should state the simple fact: "which by the ruin of the urban and rural middle classes , the petty bourgeoi s and small peasants , widen (or deepen) th e chasm betwee n the haves and have-nots" .
The last two phrase s repeat the same thing.
In the Appendi x to Section I , I give a draft amendment.
3 Paragraph 5.
Instea d of "the causes " this should read "its causes", whic h is probabl y due to a slip of the pen.
Paragraph 6.
"Mines , pits, quarries, " see above, para.
1.
"Private production," se e above .
I would say: "The transformatio n of present capitalis t productio n on behalf of individual s or joint-stoc k companies int o socialis t productio n on behalf of society as a whole and accordin g to a preconceive d plan, a transformation , etc.
.
.
.
which create s .
.
.
and by which alone can be achieve d the emancipation o f the workin g class and with it the emancipatio n of all member s of society withou t exception.
" Paragraph 7 .
I would say as in the Appendi x to Section I.
b Paragraph 8.
Instea d of "class-conscious" , which in our circles is an easily understoo d abbreviation , I would say the followin g to facilitate universa l understandin g and translatio n into foreig n languages: "wit h worker s consciou s of their class position" , or something lik e it.
Paragraph 9.
Closin g sentence : ".

.

themselves" shoul d be inserted .
The abolitio n of classes is our basic demand , withou t which the abolitio n of class rule is economically inconceivable .
Instead of "for equal rights for all", I suggest: "fo r equal rights and equal duties o f all", etc.
Equal duties are for us a particularl y importan t additio n to the bourgeois -democratic equal rights an d do away with their specificall y bourgeois meaning .
The closin g sentence : "In their struggl e .
.
.
are capable, " would be better deleted .
The imprecis e wordin g "which are capable .
.
.
of improving th e positio n of the people i n general " (who is that?), can be taken to embrac e everything , protectiv e tariffs and free trade, guilds an d freedo m of enterprise , loans on lande d security , exchange banks , compulsor y vaccinatio n and prohibitio n of vaccination, alcoholis m and prohibition , etc.
, etc.
What should b e said here , has already been said earlier , and it is unnecessar y to mention specificall y that the deman d for the whole include s every separate part , for this, to my mind, weaken s the impact .
If, however, thi s sentenc e is intende d as a link to pass on to the individual demands , somethin g resemblin g the followin g could be said: "Socia l Democrac y fights for all demand s which help it approach this goal" ("measure s and arrangements " to be deleted as repetitious).
O r else, which would be even better: to say directl y what it is all about, i.
e.
, that it is necessar y to catch up with what the bourgeoisi e has missed ; I have include d a closing sentenc e to this effec t in Appendi x I.
a I conside r this importan t in connectio n with my notes to the next section and to motivat e the proposal s put forwar d by me therein .
II.
POLITICA L DEMAND S The politica l demand s of the draft have one great fault.
It lacks precisely wha t should have been said.
If all the 10 demand s were granted w e should indeed have more diverse means of achievin g our mai n politica l aim, but the aim itself would in no wise have been achieved .
As regard s the rights being grante d to the people and thei r representatives , the imperia l constitutio n is, strictly speaking, a copy of the Prussia n constitutio n of 1850, a constitution whos e articles are extremel y reactionar y and give the government al l the real power, while the chamber s are not even allowed t o reject taxes; a constitution , which proved during the period o f the conflic t that the governmen t could do anythin g it a See this volume , p.
232.
— Ed.
liked wit h it.
187 The rights of the Reichsta g are the same as those of the Prussia n chambe r and this is why Liebknecht called thi s Reichstag th e fig-leaf of absolutism .
It is an obviou s absurdit y to wish "to transfor m all the instrument s of labour into commo n property" o n the basis of this constitutio n and the system of small states sanctione d by it, on the basis of the "union " betwee n Prussia and Reuss-Greiz-Schleiz-Lobenstein, 188 in which one has as many square mile s as the other has square inches .
To touch on that is dangerous , however .
Nevertheless , someho w or other , the thing has to be attacked .
How necessar y this is is shown precisel y at the presen t time by opportunism , which is gaining groun d in a large section of the Social-Democrati c press.
Fearing a renewa l of the Anti-Socialis t Law, or recallin g all manner o f over-hast y pronouncement s made during the reign of that law, they now want the party to find the presen t legal order in German y adequat e for putting throug h all party demand s by peaceful means .
These are attempt s to convinc e oneself and the party tha t "present-da y society is developin g toward s socialism " without askin g onesel f whethe r it does not thereb y just as necessarily outgro w the old social order and whethe r it will not have to burst this old shell by force, as a crab breaks its shell, and also whethe r in Germany , in addition , it will not have to smash the fetters o f the still semi-absolutist , and moreove r indescribabl y confused politica l order.
One can conceiv e that the old society may develop peacefull y into the new one in countrie s where the representatives o f the people concentrat e all power in their hands, where, i f one has the suppor t of the majorit y of the people , one can do as one sees fit in a constitutiona l way: in democrati c republics suc h as France and the U.
S.
A.
, in monarchie s such as Britain, wher e the imminen t abdicatio n of the dynast y in return for financia l compensatio n is discusse d in the press daily and where thi s dynast y is powerles s agains t the people .
But in Germany wher e the governmen t is almost omnipoten t and the Reichstag an d all other representativ e bodies have no real power, to advocat e such a thing in Germany , when, moreover , there is no need to do so, means removin g the fig-leaf from absolutis m and becoming onesel f a screen for its nakedness .
In the long run such a policy can only lead one's own party astray.
The y push general , abstrac t politica l question s into the foreground, thereb y concealin g the immediat e concret e questions , which at the momen t of the first great events, the first politica l crisis automaticall y pose themselves .
What can result from this except tha t at the decisiv e momen t the party suddenl y prove s helpless an d that uncertaint y and discor d on the most decisiv e issues reig n in it becaus e these issues have never been discussed ? Must ther e be a repetitio n of what happene d with protectiv e tariffs, whic h were declare d to be a matter of concer n only to the bourgeoisie, no t affectin g the interest s of the worker s in the least, that is, a matter on which everyon e could vote as he wished ? Are not man y people now going to the opposit e extrem e and are they not, in contras t to the bourgeoisie , who have becom e addicte d to protective tariffs , rehashin g the economi c distortion s of Cobde n and Brigh t and preachin g them as the purest socialism—th e purest Manchesterism I89? Thi s forgettin g of the great, the principal consideration s for the momentar y interest s of the day, this strugglin g and strivin g for the succes s of the momen t regardless o f later consequences , this sacrific e of the future of the movement fo r its present , may be "honestly " meant, but it is and remains opportunism , and "honest " opportunis m is perhap s the most dangerou s of all! Which ar e these ticklish , but very significan t points? First.
If one thing is certain it is that our party and the workin g class can only come to power under the form of a democrati c republic.
Thi s is even the specific form for the dictatorshi p of the proletariat, a s the Great French Revolutio n has already shown .
It would b e inconceivabl e for our best people to becom e minister s under a n emperor , as Miquel .
It would seem that from a legal point of view it is inadvisabl e to include the deman d for a republic directly i n the programme , althoug h this was possibl e even under Louis Phillipp e in France , and is now in Italy.
But the fact that in Germany it is not permitte d to advanc e even a republica n party programme openly , proves how totally mistake n is the belief that a republic, an d not only a republic , but also communis t society , can be establishe d in a cosy, peacefu l way.
However, th e questio n of the republi c could possibl y be passed by.
What , however , in my opinio n should and could be include d is the deman d for the concentration of all political power in the hands of the people's representatives.
That would suffice for the time being if it is impossibl e to go any further .
Second.
The reconstitution of Germany .
On the one hand, the system o f small states must be abolished—jus t try to revolutionis e society whil e there are the Bavarian-Württemberg reservation rights 190—and th e map of present-da y Thuringia , for example , is such a sorry sight.
191 On the other hand, Prussia must cease to exist and must be broken up into self-governin g province s for the specific Prussianis m to stop weighin g on Germany .
The system of small state s and Prussianis m are the two sides of the antithesi s now gripping German y in a vice, in which one side must always serve as the excuse and justificatio n for the existenc e of the other.
What shoul d take its place? In my view, the proletaria t can only use the form of the one and indivisibl e republic .
In the giganti c territory o f the United States, the federal republi c is still, on the whole, a necessity , althoug h in the Easter n states it is alread y becoming a hindrance .
It would be a step forwar d in Britai n where th e two islands are people d by four nations and in spite of a single Parliamen t three differen t system s of legislatio n alread y exist sid e by side.
In little Switzerland , it has long been a hindrance, tolerabl e only becaus e Switzerlan d is conten t to be a purely passiv e membe r of the Europea n state system .
For Germany, fédéralisation o n the Swis s mode l would be an enormous ste p backward .
Two points distinguis h a union state from a completel y unified state: first, that each membe r state, each canton, ha s its own civil and crimina l legislativ e and judicia l system, and , second , that alongsid e a popular chambe r there is also a federal chambe r in which each canton , whethe r large or small, vote s as such.
The first we have luckily overcom e and we shall not be so childis h as to reintroduc e it, the second we have in the Bundesrat and we could do very well withou t it, since our "federal state " generall y constitute s a transitio n to a unified state.
The revolutio n of 1866 and 1870 must not be reverse d from above bu t supplemente d and improve d by a movemen t from below.
So, then, a unified republic .
But not in the sense of the presen t French Republic , which is nothin g but the Empir e establishe d in I799a without the Emperor.
192 From 1792 to 1799 each Frenc h department, eac h commune , enjoyed complet e self-governmen t on the America n model , and this is what we too must have.
How self-government i s to be organise d and how we can manag e without a bureaucrac y has been shown to us by Americ a and the First Frenc h Republic , and is being shown even today by Australia , Canada 'an d the other Englis h colonies .
And a provincia l and communal self-governmen t of this type is far freer than, for instance, Swis s federalism , under which, it is true, the canton is very independen t in relatio n to the federation , but is also independent i n relatio n to the distric t and the commune .
The cantonal government s appoin t the district governor s and prefects , which is unknow n in Englis h speakin g countrie s and which we a Here and in the next sentenc e Engels mistakenly ha s 1798.
— Ed.
want to abolish here as resolutel y in the future as the Prussia n Landräte and Regierungsräte.
Probably fe w of these points shoul d be include d in the programme.
I mention them also mainly to describ e the system in Germany wher e such matter s cannot be discusse d openly , and to emphasise th e self-deceptio n of those who wish to transfor m such a system in a legal way into communis t society.
Further , to remind the part y executiv e that there are other importan t politica l questions beside s direct legislatio n by the peopl e and the gratuitous administratio n of justice withou t which we can also ultimately ge t by.
In the generall y unstabl e condition s these questions ma y becom e urgent at any time and what will happen then if they have not been discusse d by us beforehan d and no agreement ha s been reache d on them? However, wha t can be include d in the programm e and can, at least indirectly , serve as a hint of what may not be said directl y is the followin g demand : "Complete self-governmen t in the provinces , district s and communes throug h official s electe d by universa l suffrage .
The abolition o f all local and provincia l authoritie s appointe d by the state.
" Whether o r not it is possibl e to formulat e other programm e demands i n connectio n with the points discusse d above, I am less able to judge here than you can over there.
But it would be desirable t o debate these question s within the party before it is too late.
1.
I fail to see the differenc e betwee n "electio n rights and voting rights" , betwee n "election s and voting " respectively .
If such a distinctio n should be made, it should in any case be expresse d more clearl y or explaine d in a commentar y appende d to the draft.
2.
"The right of the people to propos e and reject" what} Al l laws or the decision s of the people' s representatives—thi s should be added .
5.
Complet e separatio n of the Churc h from the State.
All religious communitie s withou t exceptio n are to be treated by the state as privat e associations .
They are to be deprive d of any support fro m publi c funds and of all influenc e on publi c education.
(The y canno t be prohibite d from formin g their own schools ou t of their own fund s and from teachin g their own nonsense i n them.
) 6.
In that case the point on the "secula r characte r of the school" n o longe r arises , since it relates to the precedin g paragraph.
17-1550 8 and 9.
Here I want to draw attentio n to the following : These points deman d that the followin g should be taken over by the state: (1) the bar, (2 ) medical services, (3 ) pharmaceutics, dentistry, midwifery, nursing, etc.
, etc.
, and later the deman d is advance d that workers' insuranc e becom e a state concern .
Can all this be entrusted t o Mr.
von Caprivi ? And is it compatibl e with the rejection o f all state socialism , as stated above? 10.
Here I should say: "Progressiv e .
.
.
tax to cover all expenditure o f the state, district and community , insofar as taxes are require d for it.
Abolitio n of all indirec t state and local taxes, duties, etc.
" The rest is a redundan t commentar y or motivatio n that tend s to weake n the effect.
III.
ECONOMI C DEMAND S To item 2.
Nowher e more so than in German y does the right of association requir e guarantee s also from the state.
The closin g phrase : "for the regulation" , etc.
, should be added as item 4 an d be given a correspondin g form.
In this connectio n it should b e noted that we would be taken in good and prope r by labour chamber s made up half of worker s and half of entre-preneurs.
Fo r years to come the entrepreneur s would always have a majority, fo r only a single black sheep among the worker s would be neede d to achiev e this.
If it is not agreed upon that in cases of conflict both halves expres s separate opinions , it would be much better to have a chambe r of entrepreneur s and in addition an independent chamber of workers.
In conclusio n I should like to reques t that the draft be compared onc e more with the French programme, 193 wher e some things see m better precisel y for Sectio n III.
Being presse d for time, I unfortunatel y canno t search for the Spanis h programme, 194 which is also very good in many respects .

THE SITUATIO N IN EUROP E (FROM A LETTER TO PAUL LAFARGUE) ] 195 London, Septembe r 2, 1891 THE BRUSSEL S CONGRES S We have every reason to be satisfie d with the Brussel s Congress .
It was right to vote for the exclusio n of the anarchists : that is where th e old Internationa l broke off, that is where the new one resumes.
I t is quite simply the confirmation , ninetee n years later, of the resolution s of the Hague Congress.
196 No less importan t was the way the door was thrown wide open to the Englis h TRADE S UNIONS .
The step which shows how well the situation ha s been understood .
And the votes which tied the TRADES UNION S to "the class struggl e and the abolitio n of wage-labour" mea n that it was not a concessio n on our part.
The Domel a Nieuwenhui s inciden t has shown that the Euro-pean worker s have finally left behind the period of the domina -tion of the resoundin g phrase , and that they are aware of the responsibilities incumben t on them: they are a class constitute d as a party of "struggle" , a party which reckon s with "facts" .
And the facts are taking an increasingl y revolutionar y turn.
THE SITUATIO N IN EUROP E In Russi a there is already famine ; in German y there will be famine i n a few months ; the other countrie s will suffer less.
This is why: the harves t deficit for 1891 is estimate d at eleven and a half million hectolitre s of wheat and betwee n 87 and 100 million hectolitres o f rye.
The latter deficit will, therefore , mainly affect the two rye-consumin g countries , Russia and Germany .
This guarantee s us peace until the spring of 1892.
Russia will not mak e a move before then; so, exceptin g some inconceivabl e foolishness o n the part of Paris or Berlin, there will be no war.
On the other hand, will tsarism surviv e this crisis? I doubt it.
There ar e too many rebel element s in the big cities, and particularly i n St.
Petersburg , for them not to attemp t to seize this opportunity t o depose that alcoholi c Alexande r III, or at the very least to place him unde r the contro l of a nationa l assembly .
Perhaps h e himsel f will be forced to take the initiativ e in convening one .
Russia—tha t is to say, the governmen t and the young bourgeoisie—ha s worke d enormousl y hard to create a big national industr y (see Plekhanov' s article in the Neue Zeit*).
This industry wil l be stoppe d dead in its tracks becaus e the famine will close dow n its only market—th e domesti c market .
The Tsar will see the result s of making Russia a self-sufficien t country independen t of abroad: t o the crisis in agricultur e will be added an industria l crisis.
In German y the governmen t will decide too late, as usual, to abolish o r suspen d the duty on corn.
That will break the protectionis t majority i n the Reichstag .
The big landowners , the "rurals", 197 will no longe r want to uphold the duties on industria l products , they will want to buy as cheapl y as possible .
So we shall probabl y see a repetition o f what happene d at the time of the vote on the Anti-Socialist La w 198; a protectionis t majority , by itself divided by conflicting interest s arising out of the new situation , which finds it impossible t o reach agreemen t on the details of a protectionis t system.
Al l the possibl e proposal s being only minorit y ones; there will be either a reversio n to the free trade system , which is just as impossible, o r dissolution , with the old parties and the old majorit y unseated an d replace d by a new free-trad e majorit y oppose d to the present government .
That will mean the real, definitiv e end of the Bismarck perio d and of politica l stagnatio n in home affairs — I am not speakin g here of our party but of parties which might "possibly " govern.
Ther e will be strife betwee n the landed nobilit y and the bourgeoisie, an d betwee n the industria l bourgeoisie , which is protectionist, an d the men of commerc e and a fraction of the industrial bourgeoisi e who are free traders .
The stabilit y of the administration an d of domesti c politics will be shattered , in short there wil l be movement , struggle , life, and our party will reap all the rewards.
An d if events take this turn, our party will be able to come to powe r round about 1898.
There w e have it! I do not speak of the other countrie s because the agricultural crisi s does not affect them so severely .
But if this crisis in agriculture wer e to unleash in Englan d the industria l crisis which we have bee n awaitin g for twenty-fiv e years.

SOCIALISM I N GERMAN Y * Written: mai n text—i n Octobe r 1891, introduction an d conclusio n to the Ger-man translation—i n Januar y 1892 First publishe d in Almanach du Parti Ouvrier pour 1892, Lille , 1891 (withou t introduction an d conclusion) , and in full in Die Neue Zeit, Vol.

Engels Printed: mai n text accordin g to Almanach du Parti Ouvrier pour 1892, checked with Die Neue Zeit; introduction an d conclusio n ac-cording t o Die Neue Zeit Translated fro m the French and German The followin g is the translatio n of an article which I wrote in French a t the reques t of our Parisia n friends for the Almanack du Parti Ouvrier pour 1892.
I owe it to the French—a s well as the German—socialists t o publis h it in German .
To the French , because i t must be known in German y how openly it is possibl e to discuss wit h them the circumstance s in which Germa n socialist s would undoubtedl y take part in a war, even agains t France , and how free these Frenchme n are from the chauvinis m and vengeful -ness whic h all the bourgeoi s parties , from the monarchist s to the radicals, displa y in all their glory.
To the Germans , becaus e they are entitle d to hear from me at first hand what I have been telling the Frenc h about them.
It goes withou t saying—bu t let me make it quite clear once again—that i n this article I speak purely in my own name and not in the name of the Germa n party.
The only ones entitled to do this are the elected bodies , representative s and delegate s of this party.
And , in addition , the internationa l positio n which I have attained afte r fifty years' work prevent s me from acting as the representative o f any particula r nationa l socialis t party as oppose d to another , althoug h it does not preven t me from recallin g that I am a German and being proud of the positio n which our Germa n workers wer e the first to win for themselve s throug h struggle .
I German socialis m made its appearanc e well before 1848.
At that time ther e were two independen t tendencies .
Firstly, a workers ' movement, a branch of Frenc h working-clas s communism , a movement which , as one of its phases , produce d the Utopia n communism o f Weitling.
Secondly, a theoretica l movement , emerging fro m the collaps e of the Hegelia n philosophy ; this movement, fro m its origins , was dominate d by the name of Marx.
The Communist Manifesto o f Januar y 1848 marks the fusion of these tw o tendencies , a fusion made complet e and irrevocabl e in the furnac e of revolution , in which everyone , worker s and philosophers alike , shared equall y the persona l cost.
3 After th e defeat of the Europea n revolutio n in 1849, socialis m was reduce d in German y to a secret existence .
It was not until 1862 tha t Lassalle, a fellow studen t of Marx, again raised the socialist banner .
But it was no longer the bold socialis m of the Manifesto; wha t Lassalle demanded i n the interes t of the workin g class wa s cooperativ e productio n assiste d by state credit ; a reproduction o f the programm e of the Parisia n worker s affiliate d before 184 8 to the National o f Marrast, b of the programm e proposed b y the pure republicans, a s the alternativ e to Louis Blanc's Organisation o f Labour.
200 Lassallea n socialis m was, as we can see, very moderate .
Nevertheless , its appearanc e on the scene marks the startin g point of the second phase of socialis m in Germany ; for Lassalle' s talent, spirit and indomitabl e energy succeede d in creating a workers ' movemen t to which everythin g that had roused th e Germa n proletariat 0 over the last ten years was attached b y links positiv e or negative , amicabl e or hostile.
201 Could, then , pure Lassalleanis m on its own fulfil the socialis t aspirations o f the nation that had produce d the Manifesto? I t proved impossible .
Therefore , thanks mainly to the efforts of Liebknecht and Bebel , a workers ' party was soon forme d which loudly proclaime d the principle s of 1848.
202 Then, in 1867, three years afte r the death of Lassalle, Marx's Capital appeared .
The decline o f Lassalleanis m as such dates from this day.
Increasingl y the theorie s of Capital becam e the commo n propert y of all the German socialists , Lassallean s and others .
More than once entire groups o f Lassallean s went over en masse , drums beatin g and banners flying , to Bebel's and Liebknecht's d new party, called the Eisenach party .
As this party continue d to grow in strength , there was soon all-out hostilit y betwee n the Lassallean s and their rivals; a The Germa n translatio n reads "showe d honorabl y what they are worth " instead o f "share d equall y the persona l cost".
— Ed.
b In the Germa n text there follows "organ of pure Republicans".

c The Germa n has "the Germa n proletaria t had made independently " instead of "had rouse d the Germa n proletariat".

they fough t with cudgel s precisel y at the momen t when there was no longe r any real differenc e betwee n the combatants , when the principles, arguments , and even the method s of the struggl e of one side were in all essential s identica l with those of the other.
At this point the presenc e in the Reichsta g of deputie s from the two socialis t faction s impose d on them the necessit y of joint action.
When confronte d with bourgeoi s deputies, 3 the ridiculou s nature of this traditiona l hostilit y was obvious .
The situatio n becam e intolerable.
The n in 1875 the two faction s merged.
203 Since then the brother-enemie s have continue d to form a family united in harmony.
I f there was the slightes t chance of a split, Bismarc k himself undertoo k to eliminat e it when, in 1878, he placed German socialis m beyon d the pale of the law with his notoriou s exceptional law.
204 The hamme r blows of shared persecutio n completed th e work of forging Lassallean s and Eisenacher s into a homogeneous mass .
Today, whilst the socialis t party publishe s an official editio n of Lassalle' s works, 205 it is removin g from its programme, wit h the aid of the forme r Lassalleans , the last remaining trace s of Lassalleanis m as such.
206 Need I recoun t in detail the vicissitudes , the struggles , the setbacks an d the triumph s which have accompanie d the career of the Germa n party ? Represente d by two deputies' 5 and one hundred thousan d votes from 1866 , when universa l suffrag e opened u p to it the doors of the Reichstag , today it has 35 deputies an d a million-and-a-hal f voters , a figure which none of the othe r parties reache d in the election s of 1890.
207 Eleve n years passed a s an outlaw and in a state of siege have resulte d in a quadrupling o f its strength , to make it the stronges t party in Germany.
I n 1867 the bourgeoi s deputies 0 were able to regard their socialis t colleague s as strange creature s that had arrived from another planet ; today, whethe r they like it or not, they have to regard the m as the avant-gard e of the power to come.
The socialist part y which overthre w Bismarck , the party which after eleven year s of struggl e has broken the Anti-Socialis t Law; the socialist party , which like a rising tide overflow s all the dikes, invading town s and countryside , even in the most reactionar y Vendeesd—this part y today has reache d the point where it is a Instead of "bourgeoi s deputies " the Germa n text reads "the partie s of order".
— Ed.
b August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht.
— Ed.
c The Germa n text reads "deputie s of the partie s of order" instea d of "bourgeois deputies".
— Ed.
d The Germa n text reads "agricultura l districts " instead of "Vendees".
— Ed.
possible t o determin e the date when it will come to power almost by mathematica l calculation .
The numbe r of socialis t votes was: In 1871 101,92 7 In 1884 549,99 0 In 1874 351,67 0 In 1887 763,12 8 In 1877 493,44 7 In 1890 1,427,29 8 Since the last election s the governmen t has done its best to push the mass of people toward s socialism ; it has prosecute d associa -tions an d strikes ; it has upheld , even in the presen t scarcity , import tariff s which make the bread and meat of the poor more expensive i n order to benefi t the big landowners .
So at the elections i n 1895 we can count on two and a half million votes at least, whic h will increas e by 1900 to three and a half to four million ou t of ten million registere d voters, 3 a figure which will appear curiousl y "fin de siècle" to our bourgeois .
Facing thi s compac t and steadil y growin g mass of socialist s there are only the divide d bourgeoi s parties .
In 1890 the conservative s (two faction s combined ) receive d 1,377,41 7 votes; the nationa l liberals 1,177,807 ; the progressist s (radicals) 0 1,159,915 ; the Catholics0 1,342,113.
208 Ther e we have a situatio n in which one solid part y able to muste r two and a half million votes will be strong enoug h to force any governmen t to capitulate .
But the votes of the elector s are far from constitutin g the main strength o f Germa n socialism .
In our country you do not becom e a voter until the age of twenty-five , but at twenty you are a soldier.
Moreover, sinc e it is precisel y the younge r generatio n which provides th e party with most of its recruits , it follows that the German arm y is becomin g more and more infecte d with socialism .

209 It is workin g so well for us that we would be mad to spurn it as long as the situatio n lasts.
It remain s to be seen whether i t will be the bourgeoi s and their governmen t who will be the first to turn their back on the law in order to crush us by violence.
Tha t is what we shall be waitin g for.
You shoot first, messieurs les bourgeoisl 210 No doub t they will be the first ones to fire.
One fine day the German bourgeoi s and their government , tired of standin g with their arm s folded , witnessin g the ever increasin g advance s of socialism, wil l resort to illegalit y and violence .
To what avail? With force it is possibl e to crush a small sect, at least in a restricte d space bu t there is no force in the world which can wipe out a party of two million men a spread out over the entire surface-are a of a large empire .
Counter-revolutionar y violence 0 will be able to slow dow n the victory of socialis m by a few years; but only in order to make it all the more complet e when it comes.
II All the above was said with the reservatio n that German y will be able to pursue its economi c and politica l developmen t in peace.
A war woul d chang e all that.
And war is liable to break out at any moment.
Everyone know s what war means today.
It would be Russia and France o n one side; Germany , Austria and perhap s Italy on the other.
Socialist s in all these countries , conscripte d whethe r they like it or not, will be forced to do battle against one another : what will the Germa n socialist part y do in such a case? 0 The Germa n empire is a monarch y with semi-feuda l institutions , but dominate d ultimatel y by the economi c interest s of the bourgeoisie.
Thank s to Bismarc k this empire has committe d some grave blunders .

With the violen t annexatio n of Alsace-Lorraine th e Germa n governmen t rendere d any reconcilia -tion wit h Franc e impossibl e for a long time to come; withou t gaining an y real advantag e itself it has made Russia the arbiter of Europe.
Thi s is so eviden t that the day after Sedan 211 the Genera l Council o f the Internationa l was able to predic t the situatio n in Europe a s it is today.
In its addres s of Septembe r 9, 1870 it said: "Do the Teuton patriot s really believe that liberty and peace will be guarantee d to German y by forcin g Franc e into the arms of Russia? I f the fortun e of her arms, the arroganc e of success , and dynastic intrigu e lead German y to a dismembermen t of France , there wil l then only remain two course s open to her.
She must at all risks becom e the avowe d tool of Russia n aggrandisement , or, after som e short respite , make again ready for anothe r 'defensive ' war, not one of those new-fangle d 'localised ' wars but a war of races, a war with the combine d Slavonia n and Roma n races.
" 3 There i s no doubt : in relatio n to this Germa n empire , the French republi c as it is now represent s revolution , the bourgeoi s revolution, t o be sure, but still revolution .
But the instan t this republic place s itself under the orders of the Russia n tsar it is a different matte r entirely .
Russian tsarism is the enemy of all the Western nations , even of the bourgeoi s of these nations .
By invading Germany , the tsarist hordes would be bringin g slavery instead o f liberty, destructio n instead of development , degradatio n instead o f progress .
Arm in arm with Russia , France cannot bring a single liberatin g idea to Germany ; the French genera l who spoke to the German s about the republi c would make Europ e and America laugh .
It would mean the abdicatio n of France' s revolutionary role b; it would mean permittin g Bismarck' s empire to pose as the representativ e of Wester n progres s agains t the barbarism o f the East.
But behin d official German y there is the Germa n socialis t party, the party to which belong s the future, the imminen t future of the country.
Th e momen t this party comes to power it will neither be able to exercis e it nor to retain it withou t makin g good the injustices committe d by its predecessor s toward s the other nationalities.

so shamefull y betraye d today by the French bourgeoisie ; it will have to appea l to norther n Schleswig and to Alsace-Lorraine 212 freely to decide their own politica l future.
All these question s will thus be resolve d effortlessly , and in the near future, if German y is left to itself.
Betwee n a socialist France and a socialist German y there ca n be no Alsace-Lorrain e question ; the case will be settled in the twinklin g of an eye.
It is a matter, then, of waiting anothe r ten year s or so.
The French , English and Germa n proletaria t is still awaitin g deliverance ; could not the patriot s of Alsace-Lorrain e wait? Is there any reason to devastat e a continen t and to subjugat e it, ultimately , to the tsarist knout? Is the game worth the candle ? In the event of war first Germany , then France would be the main battleground ; these two countrie s in particula r will pay the cost in devastation .
And there is more.
This war will be distinguished fro m the outset by a series of betrayal s betwee n allies unequalled i n the annals of diplomati c betraya l to date; France or Germany, o r both, will be the main victims .
It is therefor e almost certain tha t neithe r of these countrie s will provok e an open conflict i n view of the risks they would be running .
But Russia , protected b y its geographica l positio n and by its economi c situatio n against th e more disastrou s consequence s of a series of defeats — official Russi a alone could find it in its interest s to unleas h such a terrible war ; it is Russia who will be pressin g for war.
In any case, given th e presen t politica l situation , the odds are ten to one that at the first sound of cannon on the Vistula the French armies will march o n the Rhine .
Then German y will be fightin g for its very existence .
If victorious i t will find nothin g to annex .
To the East as well as to the West it will only find province s speaking foreig n tongues ; it has enough of those already .
Beaten , crushed betwee n the French hamme r and the Russia n anvil it will have to cede Old Prussi a and the Polish province s to Russia , Schleswig to Denmark , and the entire left bank of the Rhine to France.
Eve n if France refused to accept, its ally would impose this conquest o n it; what Russia needs more than anything else is a cause of permanent enmity between France and Germany? Reconcil e these two great countrie s and that is the end of Russia n supremac y in Europe.
Dismembere d in this way, German y would be unable to play its part in Europe' s civilisin g mission b; reduce d to the role a In the Germa n text there follows : "eterna l apple of discord".

imposed o n it by Napoleo n after Tilsit it could not live except by preparing fo r a new war of nationa l rehabilitation .
But in the meanwhile it would be the humbl e tool of the Tsar, a who would not fail to make use of it—agains t France .
What wil l becom e of the Germa n socialis t party in such circumstances? I t goes withou t saying that neither the Tsar nor the French bourgeoi s republican s nor the Germa n governmen t itself would le t pass such a good opportunit y to crush the sole party which, fo r them, constitute s the enemy .
We have seen how Thier s and Bismarc k extende d their hands to each other over the ruins of the Paris Commune 213; we would then see the Tsar, Constans , Caprivi (o r their successors ) embracin g one anothe r over the corpse o f Germa n socialism .
But the Germa n socialis t party, thanks to the efforts and the unceasing sacrifice s of more than thirty years, has attaine d a position tha t none of the other socialis t parties in Europe occupies : a positio n which guarantee s it politica l power in a short while.
Socialist German y occupie s in the internationa l working-clas s movement th e most advanced , the most honourabl e and the most responsible outpost ; it is its duty to defend this outpos t against all.
b Now, if the victory of the Russian s over German y means the crushing o f socialis m in this country , what will be the duty of the German socialist s with regard to this eventuality ? Should they passively endur e the events that are threatenin g them with extinction, abando n the post they have conquere d and for which they are answerabl e to the world proletaria t withou t putting up a fight? Obviously not .
In the interes t of the Europea n revolutio n they are oblige d to defend all the position s that have been won, not to capitulate t o the enemy from withou t any more than to the enemy within; an d they cannot accomplis h that except by fightin g Russia and its allies, whoeve r they may be, to the bitter end.
If the French republi c placed itself at the service of His Majest y the Tsar, Autocra t of all the Russias , the Germa n socialist s would fight it with regret , but they would fight it all the same.
The Frenc h republic ma y represen t vis-à-vis the Germa n empire the bourgeoi s revolution.

245 working fo r the Russia n Tsar, Germa n socialis m represent s the proletarian revolution .
A war in which Russian s and Frenchme n invade d German y would be , for Germany , a war to the death, in which, in order to ensure it s nationa l existence , it would have to resort to the most revolutionary means .
The presen t government , certainly , would not unleas h revolution , unless it were forced to.
But there is a strong part y which would force it to, or if necessar y replace it: the socialist party .
We have not forgotte n the marvellou s exampl e which Franc e gave us in 1793.
214 The centenar y of '93 is approaching .
If the Tsar's thirs t for conques t and the chauvinis t impatienc e of the French bourgeoisi e stop the victoriou s but peacefu l march of the German socialists , the latter are ready, you may be sure, to prove that the Germa n proletarian s of today are not unworth y of the French sans-culotte s of a hundre d years ago, and that 1893 will equal 1793 .
And then the soldier s of Constans , on setting foot on German soil , will be greete d with the song a: What, woul d foreig n horde s Lay dow n the law in our homes ? Let us sum up.
Peace ensure s the victory of the Germa n socialist part y in some ten years' time; war offers it either victory in two or three years, or complet e ruin, at least for the next fifteen t o twenty years.
In this positio n the Germa n socialist s would hav e to be mad to prefer the all-or-nothin g of war to the certain victor y which peace offers them.
There is more.
No socialist, o f whateve r country , can desire victory by war, either by the presen t Germa n governmen t or by the Frenc h bourgeoi s republic; eve n less by the Tsar, which would be tantamoun t to the subjugation o f Europe .
That is why socialist s everywher e deman d that peac e be maintained .
But if war is to break out nonetheless , one thin g is certain .
This war, in which fifteen to twenty million armed me n would slaughte r one anothe r and devastat e Europ e as it has never been devastate d before—thi s war would either lead to the immediat e triump h of socialism , or it would lead to such an upheaval i n the old order of things , it would leave behind it everywhere suc h a heap of ruins, that the old capitalis t society would becom e more impossibl e than ever, and the social revolu-tion, set back by ten or fifteen years, would only be all the more radical an d more rapidly implemented .

18-1550 * * * That, then , was the article from the French workers ' calendar .
It was writte n in the late summer , when the heads of the French bourgeoisie wer e still flushed with the champagne-induce d inebria -tion of Kronstadt, 215 and the great manoeuvre s on the battle area of 1814 betwee n the Seine and the Marne had brough t patrioti c enthusiasm t o a head.
At that time France—th e Franc e that expresses itsel f in the big press and the parliamentar y majority — was indee d ripe for more or less unlimite d stupidit y in the service of Russia , and the eventualit y of war moved into the foregroun d as a possibility .
And in order, should it become a reality, to prevent an y last minute misunderstandin g betwee n the Frenc h and Germa n socialists , I considere d it necessar y to make it clear to the forme r what in my opinio n the necessar y attitud e of the latter should b e with regard to such a war.
But the n a powerfu l check was impose d on the Russia n war-monger.
Firs t came the news of harvest failure at home, with every reaso n to expect a famine.
Then came the failure of the Paris loan, 216 signifyin g the final collaps e of Russia n state credit.
The fou r hundre d million marks were, it was said, oversubscribe d many times ; but when the Paris banker s sought to palm off the bonds ont o the public , all their attempt s failed; the esteeme d subscribers ha d to dispos e of their good securitie s in order to cover thes e bad ones—an d to such an extent that the other large European stoc k exchange s were also forced down by these mass sales; the new "Russians " sank severa l per cent below their issue price—in short , there was such a crisis that the Russia n government ha d to take back a hundre d and sixty million s worth of bond s and only receive d cover for two hundre d and forty instead o f four hundre d million .
At this the proclamatio n of a further Russia n attemp t to get credit—thi s time for all of eight hundred millio n marks—whic h had been gaily crowed out to the world, fel l throug h miserably .
And at the same time it also becam e plain tha t French capita l has no "patriotism " at all, but it does have—however muc h it may beat the drum in the press— a salutory fea r of war.
Since the n the failure of the harves t has indeed develope d into a famine, an d such a famine as we in Wester n Europ e have not seen on this scale for a long time, such as rarely occurs even in India, the typica l country for such calamities , indeed such as barely ever reached thi s height in the holy Russia of earlier times, when there were stil l no railways .
How does this come about? How can it be explained? Very simply .
The Russia n famin e is not the result of a mere failure o f the harvest , it is a part of the tremendou s social revolution whic h Russia has been undergoin g since the Crimea n War; it is simply the transformatio n of the chroni c suffering s linked wit h this revolutio n into acute suffering s brough t about by this bad harvest .
Old Russi a went irrevocabl y to its grave the day when Tsar Nicholas, despairin g of himself and of old Russia , took poison.
217 On its ruins the Russia of the bourgeoisi e is being built.
The beginning s of a bourgeoisi e were alread y presen t at that time.
Partly banker s and import merchants—mostl y German s and German Russian s or their descendants—partl y Russian s who had risen throug h domesti c trading , but particularl y schnapp s pedlar s and arm y supplier s who had grown rich at the expens e of the state and people , and also a few manufacturers .
From now on this bourgeoisie, particularl y the industria l bourgeoisie , was literall y cultivated b y mean s of massiv e govermen t aid, by subsidies , premiums, an d protectiv e tariffs that were graduall y raised to the utmost.
218 Th e immeasurabl e Russia n Empir e was suppose d to become a productio n area sufficien t unto itself, which could dispense wit h import s from abroa d entirel y or almost entirely .
And it is to ensure not only that the domesti c marke t should continually grow , but also that the product s of warme r climes should b e produce d inside the countr y itself, that there is this steady strivin g for conquest s in the Balkan peninsul a and in Asia, with Constantinopl e and British India respectivel y as the ultimat e goals.
This is the secret , the economi c basis of the drive for expansion tha t is so rife amon g the Russia n bourgeoisie , the branch tha t leads south-wes t being called Pan-Slavism.
219 However, th e serfdo m of the peasant s was absolutel y inconsis -tent wit h such industria l plans.
It fell in 1861.
But how! The Prussian abolitio n of servitud e and statute labour carried out slowly between 181 0 and 1851 220 was taken as a model; but everythin g was to be settled in a few years.
Consequently , in order to break the resistance o f the big landowner s and "serf-owners , concession s had to be made to them which were quite differen t from those granted by the Prussia n state and its corrupt officials to the graciou s landlord s of their day .
And as for corruptibility , the Prussia n bureaucra t was nothing bu t a babe-in-arm s compare d with the Russian tschinownik* Thus it was that in the partitio n of the land the nobility receive d the a Engels' transliteration o f the Russia n word meanin g "a civil servant".

18* lion's share , and as a rule the land made fertile by the labour of many generations o f peasants , while the peasant s receive d only the minimum necessar y for subsistence , and even this was generall y allotted t o them in poor wasteland .
Commo n forest and commo n grazing wen t to the landlord ; if the peasan t wished to use them—and withou t them he could not exist—h e had to pay the landlord fo r it.
To ensure , however , that both landed nobilit y and peasant s were ruine d as quickly as possible , the nobilit y was given the capitalised redemptio n sum in state bonds from the governmen t in a lump sum, while the peasant s had to pay the redemptio n price in long-ter m instalments .
As was only to be expected , the nobilit y for the most part squandere d the money receive d immediately , while th e peasant , facing what was, for someon e in his position , enormous payments , was suddenl y hurled out of a subsistenc e economy int o a money economy .
The Russia n peasant , who previousl y had hardly had to make any mone y payment s exceptin g relativel y low taxes , is now supposed no t only to live off the smalle r and poorer plot allotted to him and, after the abolitio n of the free wood and free grazin g on commo n land, feed his livestoc k throug h the winter and improve hi s plot—bu t also to pay increase d taxes as well as the annual redemptio n instalment , and in cash too.
He was thus placed in a position in which he could neithe r live nor die.
On top of this there was the competitio n of the newly develope d large-scale industry , which deprive d him of the marke t for his domestic industry—domesti c industr y was the main source of money fo r countles s Russia n peasants—or , where this was not yet quite the case, delivere d up this domesti c industr y to the mercy of the merchant , i.
e.
the middleman , the Saxon entrepreneu r or the English SWEATERS , thus turnin g the peasant s engage d in domesti c industry int o nothin g less than the slaves of capital .
In short, anyone curiou s to know how the Russia n peasant s have been abused ove r the last thirty years need only look up the chapte r on the "Creatio n of the Home Market " (Chapte r 24, Section 5) in the first volum e of Marx's Capital* The ravage s wrough t among the peasant s by the transitio n from a subsistenc e econom y to a money economy—thi s chief means of producing th e home market for industria l capital—ar e depicte d in a classic manne r by Boisguilleber t and Vauba n from the exampl e a K.

a But what occurre d then is child's play compare d with what is happenin g in Russia .
Firstly the scale is three or four times larger, and secondl y the revolutionisatio n of the condition s of production , in whose service this transitio n is being force d on the peasants , is infinitel y more thorough-going .
The Frenc h peasan t was slowly dragge d into the spher e of manufacture, th e Russia n peasan t is being swept overnigh t into the tornad o of large-scal e industry .
If manufactur e felled peasant s with the flint-lock , large-scal e industr y is carryin g out the job with a repeating-rifle .
This wa s the positio n when the failure of the harves t in 1891 exposed a t a stroke the entire upheava l and its consequences , which ha d been quietly taking place for years but had remaine d invisible t o the Europea n philistine .
This positio n was such that the first bad harves t was bound to turn into a national crisis.
And now ther e is a crisis that will not be mastere d for years to come.
In the face of a famine like this every governmen t is powerless , but particularly th e Russian , which expressl y trains its official s in thieving.
Sinc e 1861 the old communis t custom s and institution s of the Russia n peasant s have partly been undermine d by economi c developments, partl y destroye d systematicall y by the government .
The old communis t communit y has disintegrated , or is in the process o f so doing, but at the very momen t when the individua l peasant i s being placed on his own feet, the groun d is remove d from unde r them.
Is it any wonde r that last autumn winter.
cor n was sow n in extremel y few districts ? And where it was sown the weather ruine d most of it.
Is it any wonde r that the main instrument o f the peasant , the beast of burden , first had nothin g to eat itself and then, for this irrefutabl e reason , was eaten by the peasant himself ? Is it any wonde r that the peasan t is leaving house and hom e and fleeing to the cities, vainly lookin g for work but unfailingly bringin g typhoi d with him? In a word: here we have before us not an isolate d famine but an immense crisi s prepare d by a prolonged , quiet economi c revolu -tion and merely rendere d acute by the failure of the harvest .
This acute crisis , however , is assumin g in its turn a chronic form and threatens t o stay for years.
Economicall y it is acceleratin g the dissolution o f the old communis t peasan t community , the enrich -ment of the village usurer s (the kulaki) an d their transfor -mation int o big landowners , and the transfe r of the lande d a See P.

[TO TH E EDITOR S OF THE VOLKSFREUND] London, Novembe r 13, 1891 My dear comrades , Accept m y hearties t thanks for your friendl y invitatio n to the tenth anniversar y celebration s for the Volksfreund.
Unfortunately I shall be unable to come myself, since my work on the third volum e of Marx' s Capital, whic h must finally be published , keeps me here.
These line s must represen t me.
I can howeve r congratulat e you heartil y on this momentou s occasion.
I know what it costs to keep alive a militan t Social Democratic pape r like the Volksfreund for ten years under the Austrian pres s and police laws, and I know too, at least in general , the sacrifice s which have had to be made to do this.
That yo u have succeeded despit e everythin g is all the more praiseworth y as the Austrian pres s laws, drafted in realisatio n that by and large the organs o f the propertied classe s are not dangerous , appear to aim at ruinin g or taming the workers ' papers by pressur e upon their financial resources.
An d therefore , if the worker s of Brunn have managed, despit e this financia l pressure , to maintai n their paper for ten years withou t in any way denyin g their banner , this is once again proo f of the tenacit y and readines s for sacrific e which is to be found today only amongs t the workers .
I canno t end this letter withou t expressin g once again my pleasure that , while young Czech 222 and old Germa n bourgeoi s are everywhere a t loggerheads , the Czech and Germa n worker s are fighting united , shoulde r to shoulder , for the liberatio n of the entire proletariat .

Kautsky has just informe d me that my friend Lessne r has told her you intend to bring me musica l greeting s this evenin g on my seventy-firs t birthday .
Howeve r I had alread y arrange d to spend th e evenin g with a friend, 3 and since others will be comin g too, it is absolutel y impossibl e to revers e my plans now; very regretfully, I shall not be able to be at home this evening .
I am therefor e obliged , dear comrades , to convey to you by letter m y most sincere thanks for your so kind and honourabl e offer, an d at the same time my regret s that I was not informe d earlier o f your plans.
Both Marx and I were always oppose d to all public tribute s to individuals , except in a case where a greater purpose coul d be served ; and most particularl y agains t such tributes a s would centre around ourselve s in our lifetime .
Had I had the slightes t indicatio n that such an honou r was planne d for me, I would have hurrie d to request , humbly but most urgently , that the singers should refrain from carryin g out their intention .
To my regret I only learned of this today, and being so reluctantl y faced wit h the necessit y of frustratin g your plans, as well meanin g and honourabl e as they are, I can only best make amend s by assuring yo u that the few years I may expect to surviv e at the outside, an d the whole strengt h of which I still dispose , I shall continue t o devote unstintingl y to our great cause, as I have done a Eleano r Marx-Aveling.
— Ed for nearl y fifty years now—th e cause of the internationa l proletariat.

Berlin 1970 Publishe d in Englis h for the first time PREFACE [TO TH E 1892 ENGLIS H EDITIO N OF THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING-CLASS IN ENGLAND IN 1844]226 The book , an Englis h translatio n of which is here republished , was first issued in German y in 1845.
The author , at that time, was young, twenty-fou r years of age, and his productio n bears the stamp of his youth with its good and its faulty features , of neither of which he feels ashamed .
It was translate d into English , in 1886, by an America n lady, Mrs.
F.
Kelley Wischnewetzky , and pub-lished in the followin g year in New York.
The America n edition being as good as exhausted , and having never been extensivel y circulated o n this side of the Atlantic , the presen t Englis h copyright editio n is brough t out with the full consen t of all parties interested.
For the America n edition , a new Preface a and an Appendix 15 were writte n in Englis h by the author .
The first had little to do with the book itself; it discusse d the America n Working-Clas s Movement o f the day, and is, therefore , here omitte d as irrelevant; th e second—th e origina l preface—i s largely made use of in the presen t introductor y remarks .
The stat e of things describe d in this book belong s to-day in many respects t o the past, as far as Englan d is concerned .
Thoug h not expressly state d in our recognise d treatises , it is still a law of modern Politica l Econom y that the larger the scale on which capitalistic productio n is carried on, the less can it suppor t the petty device s of swindlin g and pilferin g which characteris e its early stages.

tricks tha t serve him so well in his own country , and are generall y practised there , he finds to be out of date and out of place when he come s to Hambur g or Berlin; and again the commissio n agent who hail s from Berli n or Hamburg , Jew or Christian , after frequenting th e Mancheste r Exchang e for a few months , finds out that in order to buy cotton-yar n or cloth cheap, he, too, had better drop thos e slightl y more refine d but still miserabl e wiles and subterfuges whic h are considere d the acme of clevernes s in his native country .
The fact is, those tricks do not pay any longer in a large market , where time is money , and where a certain standar d of commercia l moralit y is unavoidabl y developed , purely as a means o f saving time and trouble .
And it is the same with the relation betwee n the manufacture r and his "hands" .
The reviva l of trade, after the crisis of 1847, was the dawn of a new industria l epoch.
The repeal of the Corn Laws 227 and the financial reform s subsequen t thereon gave to English industr y and commerce al l the elbow-roo m they had asked for.
The discover y of the California n and Australia n gold-field s followe d in rapid succession.
Th e colonia l market s develope d at an increasin g rate their capacit y for absorbin g English manufacture d goods.
In India millions o f hand-weaver s were finally crushe d out by the Lancashire power-loom .
China was more and more being opene d up.
Above all, the United States—then , commerciall y speaking , a mere colonia l market , but by far the bigges t of them all— underwent a n economi c developmen t astoundin g even for that rapidly progressiv e country .
And, finally , the new mean s of communication introduce d at the close of the precedin g period — railways an d ocean steamers—wer e now worke d out on an international scale ; they realise d actuall y what had hithert o existed only potentially , a world-market .
This world-market , at first, was composed o f a number of chiefly or entirely agricultura l countrie s grouped aroun d one manufacturin g centre—England—whic h consumed th e greate r part of their surplu s raw produce , and supplied the m in return with the greate r part of their require -ments in manufacture d articles .
No wonde r England' s industria l progress wa s colossa l and unparalleled , and such that the status of 1844 now appear s to us as comparativel y primitiv e and insignific -ant.
And in proportio n as this increas e took place, in the same proportion di d manufacturin g industr y becom e apparentl y moral-ised.
Th e competitio n of manufacture r agains t manufacture r by means o f petty thefts upon the workpeopl e did no longer pay.
Trade ha d outgrow n such low means of making money ; they were not wort h while practisin g for the manufacturin g millionaire , and served merel y to keep alive the competitio n of smalle r traders , thankful t o pick up a penny whereve r they could.
Thus the truck system wa s suppressed , the Ten Hours ' Bill228 was enacted , and a number o f other secondar y reform s introduced—muc h agains t the spiri t of Free Trade and unbridle d competition , but quite as much in favour of the giant-capitalis t in his competitio n with his less favoure d brother .
Moreover , the larger the concern , and with it the numbe r of hands, the greate r the loss and inconvenienc e caused b y every conflic t betwee n master and men; and thus a new spirit cam e over the masters , especiall y the large ones, which taught the m to avoid unnecessar y squabbles , to acquiesc e in the existence an d powe r of Trade s Unions , and finally even to discover i n strikes—a t opportun e times— a powerfu l means to serve thei r own ends.
The larges t manufacturers , formerl y the leaders o f the war agains t the working-class , were now the foremost t o preach peace and harmony .
And for a very good reason.
Th e fact is that all these concession s to justice and philanthropy wer e nothin g else but means to accelerat e the concentration o f capital in the hands of the few, for whom the niggardly extr a extortion s of former years had lost all importanc e and had becom e actual nuisances ; and to crush all the quicke r and all the safer their smalle r competitor s who could not make both ends mee t withou t such perquisites .
Thus the developmen t of production o n the basis of the capitalisti c system has of itself sufficed—at leas t in the leadin g industries , for in the more unimportant branche s this is far from being the case—t o do away with all those minor grievance s which aggravate d the workman' s fate durin g its earlier stages.
And thus it renders more and mor£ evident th e great centra l fact that the cause of the miserabl e condition o f the working-clas s is to be sought , not in thes^ minor grievances, bu t in the capitalistic system itself.
The wage-worke r sells to the capitalis t his labour-forc e for a certain daily sum.
After a few hours ' work he has reproduce d the value of that sum; but the substance o f his contrac t is, that he has to work anothe r series of hours to complet e his working-day ; and the value he produce s during thes e additiona l hours of surplu s labour is surplu s value which cost s the capitalis t nothing but yet goes into his pocket.
That is the basis of the system which tends more and more to split up civilised societ y into a few Rothschild s and Vanderbilts , the owners of all the means of productio n and subsistence , on the one hand, and an immens e numbe r of wage-workers , the owners of nothin g but their labour-force , on the other.
And that this result is caused , not by this or that secondar y grievance , but by the system itself—this fac t has been brough t out in bold relief by the development o f Capitalis m in Englan d since 1847.
Again, th e repeate d visitation s of cholera , typhus, smallpox , and other epidemic s have shown the British bourgeoi s the urgen t necessity o f sanitatio n in his towns and cities, if he wishes to save himself an d family from fallin g victims to such diseases .
Accord -ingly, th e most crying abuses describe d in this book have either disappeared o r have been made less conspicuous .
Drainag e has been introduce d or improved , wide avenue s have been opened out athwart man y of the worst "slums " I had to describe .
"Little Ireland" ha d disappeared , and the "Seven Dials" are next on the list for sweepin g away.
229 But what of that? Whole district s which in 1844 I could describ e as almost idyllic have now, with the growth o f the towns, fallen into the same state of dilapidation , discomfort, an d misery .
Only the pigs and the heaps of refuse are no longe r tolerated .
The bourgeoisi e have made further progres s in the art of hiding the distres s of the working-class .
But that, in regard t o their dwellings , no substantia l improvemen t has taken place is amply proved by the Report of the Royal Commissio n "on the Housin g of the Poor", 1885.
a And this is the case, too, in other respects.
Polic e regulation s have been plentifu l as blackberries ; but they can only hedge in the distres s of the workers , they canno t remove it .
But whil e Englan d has thus outgrow n the juvenil e state of capitalist exploitatio n describe d by me, other countrie s have only just attaine d it.
France , Germany , and especiall y America , are the formidable competitor s who at this moment—a s foresee n by me in 1844b—are mor e and more breakin g up England' s industria l monopoly.
Thei r manufacture s are young as compare d with those of England , but increasin g at a far more rapid rate than the latter; and, curiou s enough , they have at this momen t arrived at about the same phase of developmen t as English manufactur e in 1844.
With regar d to America , the paralle l is indeed most striking .
True, the externa l surrounding s in which the working-clas s is placed in America ar e very different , but the same economica l laws are at work, an d the results , if not identica l in every respect , must still be of the same order.
Hence we find in Americ a the same struggle s for a shorter working-day , for a legal limitatio n of the working -time, especiall y of women and childre n in factories ; we find the a See Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes.

truck syste m in full blossom , and the cottage system, 230 in rural districts, mad e use of by the "bosses " as a means of dominatio n over the workers .
When I received , in 1886, the America n papers with account s of the great strike of 12,000 Pennsylvania n coal-miners i n the Connellsvill e district, 231 I seemed but to read my own descriptio n of the North of Englan d colliers ' strike of 1844.
a The sam e cheatin g of the workpeopl e by false measure ; the same truck system ; the same attemp t to break the miners ' resistanc e by the capitalists ' last, but crushing , resource , the evictio n of the men out of their dwellings , the cottage s owned by the companies .
I have not attempted , in this translation , to bring the book up to date, or to point out in detail all the change s that have taken place since 1844 .
And for two reasons : Firstly, to do this properly , the size of the book must be about doubled ; and, secondly , the first volume o f Das Kapital, by Karl Marx, an Englis h translatio n of which is before the public, 232 contain s a very ample descriptio n of the state of the British workin g class, as it was about 1865, that is to say, at the time when British industria l prosperit y reache d its culminatin g point.
I should, then, have been obliged again to go over the groun d alread y covere d by Marx's celebrate d work.
It will be hardly necessar y to point out that the genera l theoretical standpoin t of this book—philosophical , economical , political—does no t exactly coincid e with my standpoin t of to-day.
Modern internationa l Socialism , since fully develope d as a science, chiefly an d almost exclusivel y throug h the efforts of Marx, did not as yet exist in 1844.
My book represent s one of the phases of its embryonic development ; and as the human embryo , in its early stages, stil l reproduce s the gill-arche s of our fish-ancestors , so this book exhibit s everywher e the traces of the descen t of Moder n Socialism fro m one of its ancestors , Germa n philosophy .
Thus great stres s is laid on the dictum that Communis m is not a mere party doctrin e of the workin g class, but a theory compassin g the emancipation o f society at large, includin g the capitalis t class, from its presen t narrow conditions .
This is true enoug h in the abstract, bu t absolutel y useless , and sometime s worse, in practice .
So long as the wealth y classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation, bu t strenuousl y oppos e the self-emancipatio n of the workin g class, so long the social revolutio n will have to be prepared an d fought out by the workin g class alone.

19-1550 Frederick Engel s bourgeoisie t o be the emancipatio n of the whole human race; but the nobilit y and clergy would not see it; the proposition—thoug h for the time being, with respec t to feudalism , an abstrac t historica l truth—soon becam e a mere sentimentalism , and disappeare d from vie w altogethe r in the fire of the revolutionar y struggle .
And to-day, th e very peopl e who, from the "impartiality " of their superior standpoint , preach to the worker s a Socialis m soarin g high abov e their class interest s and class struggles, , and tendin g to reconcile i n a higher humanit y the interest s of both the contending classes—thes e people are either neophytes , who have still to learn a great deal, or they are the worst enemie s of the workers—wolves i n sheep' s clothing .
The recurrin g period of the great industria l crisis is stated in the text as five years.
This was the period apparentl y indicate d by the cours e of events from 1825 to 1842.
But the industria l history from 184 2 to 1868 has shown that the real period is one of ten years; that the intermediat e revulsion s were secondar y and tended more an d more to disappear .
Since 1868 the state of things has changed again , of which more anon.
I have taken care not to strike out of the text the many prophecies, amongs t others that of an imminen t social revolutio n in England , which my youthfu l ardour induce d me to ventur e upon.
Th e wonde r is, not that a good many of them prove d wrong, bu t that so many of them have proved right, and that the critical stat e of English trade, to be brough t on by Continenta l and especially America n competition , which I then foresaw—thoug h in too shor t a period—ha s now actuall y come to pass.
In this respect I can, and am bound to, bring the book up to date, by placin g here an article which I publishe d in the Londo n Commonweal o f March 1 , 1885, under the heading : "Englan d in 1845 and in 1885.
"233 It gives at the same time a short outline of the history of the Englis h workin g class during these forty years, and is as follows: "Forty year s ago Englan d stood face to face with a crisis, solvable t o all appearance s by force only.
The immens e and rapid development o f manufacture s had outstrippe d the extensio n of foreign market s and the increas e of demand .
Every ten years the march o f industr y was violentl y interrupte d by a genera l commercial crash , followed , after a long perio d of chroni c depression, b y a few short years of prosperity , and always ending in feveris h over-productio n and consequen t renewe d collapse .
The capitalist clas s clamoure d for Free Trad e in corn, 234 and threatened t o enforc e it by sendin g the starvin g populatio n of the towns bac k to the countr y district s whenc e they came, to invade them, as John Bright said, not as pauper s beggin g for bread, but as an army quartere d upon the enemy.
3 The workin g masses of the town s demande d their share of politica l power—th e People' s Charter235; the y were supporte d by the majorit y of the small trading class , and the only differenc e betwee n the two was whether th e Charte r should be carried by physica l or by moral force.
The n came the commercia l crash of 1847 and the Irish famine, an d with both the prospec t of revolution .
"The Frenc h Revolutio n of 1848 saved the English middle class.
The Socialisti c pronunciamento s of the victoriou s French workme n frightened th e small middle class of Englan d and disorganise d the narrower, bu t more matter-of-fac t movemen t of the Englis h working class .
At the very momen t when Chartis m was bound to assert itsel f in its full strength , it collapse d internall y before even it collapsed externally , on the 10th of April, 1848.
The action of the workin g class was thrust into the background .
The capitalis t class triumphe d along the whole line.
"The Refor m Bill of 1831 237 had been the victory of the whole capitalist clas s over the landed aristocracy .
The repeal of the Corn Laws wa s the victory of the manufacturin g capitalis t not only over the lande d aristocracy , but over those section s of capitalists , too, whose interest s were more or less bound up with the landed interest—bankers, stock-jobbers , fund-holders , etc.
Free Trade meant th e readjustmen t of the whole home and foreign , commercial an d financia l policy of Englan d in accordanc e with the interests o f the manufacturin g capitalists—th e class which now represented th e nation .
And they set about this task with a will.
Every obstacl e to industria l productio n was mercilessl y removed .
The tarif f and the whole system of taxatio n were revolutionised .
Everything wa s made subordinat e to one end, but that end of the utmos t importanc e to the manufacturin g capitalist : the cheapening o f all raw produce , and especiall y of the means of living of the workin g class; the reductio n of the cost of raw material, an d the keepin g down—i f not as yet the bringing down—of wages .
Englan d was to becom e the 'worksho p of the world'238; al l other countrie s were to becom e for Englan d what Ireland alread y was—market s for her manufacture d goods , supplying he r in return with raw material s and food.
England , the great manufacturin g centre of an agricultura l world, with an a The statemen t was made apparentl y not by Bright but by his followers .

— Ed 19* ever-increasing numbe r of corn and cotton-growin g Ireland s revolving aroun d her, the industria l sun.
What a gloriou s prospect! "The manufacturin g capitalist s set about the realisatio n of this their grea t object with that strong commo n sense and that contempt fo r traditiona l principle s which has ever distinguishe d them fro m their more narrow-minde d compeer s on the Continent .
Chartism wa s dying out.
The reviva l of commercia l prosperity , natural afte r the revulsio n of 1847 had spent itself, was put down altogether t o the credit of Free Trade .
Both these circumstance s had turne d the Englis h workin g class, politically , into the tail of the 'grea t Liberal Party', the party led by the manufacturers .
This advantage, onc e gained , had to be perpetuated .
And the manufacturing capitalists , from the Chartis t opposition , not to Free Trade , but to the transformatio n of Free Trade into the one vital nationa l question , had learnt , and were learnin g more and more, tha t the middl e class can never obtain full social and political powe r over the nation except by the help of the workin g class.
Thus a gradual change came over the relation s betwee n both classes.
Th e Factor y Acts, 2 9 once the bugbea r of all manufactur -ers, were not only willingl y submitte d to, but their expansio n into acts regulatin g almos t all trades was tolerated .
Trades Unions , hitherto considere d invention s of the devil himself , were now petted an d patronise d as perfectl y legitimat e institutions , and as useful mean s of spreadin g sound economica l doctrine s amongs t the workers .
Even strikes , than which nothin g had been more nefarious u p to 1848, were now graduall y found out to be occasionally ver y useful, especiall y when provoke d by the master s themselves, a t their own time.
Of the legal enactments , placing the workman a t a lower level or at a disadvantag e with regard to the master, a t least the most revoltin g were repealed .
And, practically , that horri d 'People' s Charter ' actuall y becam e the politica l programme o f the very manufacturer s who had oppose d it to the last.
'Th e Abolitio n of the Propert y Qualification ' and 'Vote by Ballot' ar e now the law of the land.
The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884240 make a near approac h to 'universa l suffrage' , at least such as it now exists in Germany ; the Redistributio n Bill now befor e Parliament create s 'equal electora l districts'—o n the whole not more unequa l than those of Germany ; 'paymen t of members' , and shorter, i f not actually 'annua l Parliaments' , are visibly loomin g in the distance—an d yet there are people who say that Chartis m is dead.
"The Revolutio n of 1848, not less than many of its predecessors , has had strang e bedfellow s and successors .
The very people who put it down have become , as Karl Marx used to say, its testamentary executors.
241 Loui s Napoleo n had to create an independent an d united Italy, Bismarc k had to revolutionis e Germany an d to restor e Hungaria n independence , and the English manufacturer s had to enact the People' s Charter .
"For England , the effects of this dominatio n of the manufactur -ing capitalist s were at first startling .
Trade revived and extende d to a degree unhear d of even in this cradle of moder n industry ; the previou s astoundin g creation s of steam and machiner y dwindled int o nothin g compare d with the immens e mass of productions o f the twenty years from 1850 to 1870, with the overwhelming figure s of export s and imports , of wealth accumu -lated in the hands of capitalist s and of human workin g power concentrated i n the large towns.
Th e progres s was indeed inter-rupted, a s before, by a crisis every ten years, in 1857 as well as in 1866; but these revulsion s were now considere d as natural , inevitable events , which must be fatalisticall y submitte d to, and which alway s set themselve s right in the end.
"And th e conditio n of the workin g class during this period ? There wa s temporar y improvemen t even for the great mass.
But this improvemen t always was reduce d to the old level by the influx of the great body of the unemploye d reserve , by the constan t superseding o f hands by new machinery , by the immigratio n of the agricultura l population , now, too, more and more supersede d by machines .
"A permanen t improvemen t can be recognise d for two 'pro-tected' section s only of the workin g class.
Firstly, the factor y hands.
The fixing by Act of Parliamen t of their working-da y within relativel y rationa l limits has restore d their physica l constitu -tion and endowe d them with a moral superiority , enhance d by their loca l concentration .
They are undoubtedl y better off than before 1848 .
The best proof is that, out of ten strikes they make, nine are provoke d by the manufacturer s in their own interests , as the only means of securin g a reduced production .
You can never get the master s to agree to work 'short time', let manufacture d goods be ever so unsaleable ; but get the work-peopl e to strike, and the master s shut their factorie s to a man.
"Secondly, th e great Trades Unions .
They are the organisation s of those trades in which the labour of grown-up men predominates , or is alone applicable .
Here the competitio n neithe r of women and children no r of machiner y has so far weakene d their organise d strength.
Th e engineers , the carpenter s and joiners , the brick-layers, ar e each of them a power, to that extent that, as in the case of the bricklayer s and bricklayers ' labourers , they can even successfully resis t the introductio n of machinery .
That their condition ha s remarkabl y improve d since 1848 there can be no doubt, an d the best proof of this is in the fact that for more than fifteen year s not only have their employer s been with them, but they wit h their employers , upon exceedingl y good terms.
They form an aristocrac y among the workin g class; they have succeede d in enforcin g for themselve s a relativel y comfortabl e position , and they accep t it as final.
They are the model working-me n of Messrs .
Leone Lev i & Gif fen, and they are very nice people indeed nowadays t o deal with, for any sensibl e capitalis t in particula r and for the whole capitalis t class in general .
"But as to the great mass of working-people , the state of misery and insecurit y in which they live now is as low as ever, if not lower.
Th e East End of Londo n is an ever-spreadin g pool of stagnant miser y and desolation , of starvatio n when out of work, and degradation , physica l and moral, when in work.
And so in all other larg e towns—abstractio n made of the privilege d minorit y of the workers ; and so in the smalle r towns and in the agricultura l districts.
Th e law which reduce s the value o f labour-powe r to the value of the necessar y means of subsistence , and the other law which reduce s its average price, a s a rule, to the minimu m of those means o f subsistence , these laws act upon them with the irresistibl e force of an automati c engine which crushe s them betwee n its wheels.
"This, then, was the positio n created by the Free Trade policy of 1847, and by twenty years of the rule of the manufacturin g capitalists.
Bu t then a change came.
The crash of 1866 was, indeed, followe d by a slight and short revival about 1873; but that did not last.
We did not, indeed , pass throug h the full crisis at the time it was due, in 1877 or 1878; but we have had, ever since 1876, a chronic state of stagnatio n in all dominan t branche s of industry.
Neithe r will the full crash come; nor will the period of longed-for prosperit y to which we used to be entitle d before and after it.
A dull depression , a chronic glut of all market s for all trades, tha t is what we have been living in for nearly ten years.
How is this? "The Fre e Trade theory was based upon one assumption : that England wa s to be the one great manufacturin g centre of an agricultural world .
And the actual fact is that this assumptio n has turned ou t to be a pure delusion .
The condition s of moder n industry, steam-powe r and machinery , can be establishe d whereve r there is fuel, especiall y coals.
And other countrie s beside s England—France, Belgium , Germany , America , even Russia — have coals .
And the people over there did not see the advantag e of being turned into Irish paupe r farmer s merely for the greate r wealth an d glory of English capitalists .
They set resolutel y about manufacturing, no t only for themselves , but for the rest of the world; an d the consequenc e is that the manufacturin g monopol y enjoyed b y Englan d for nearly a century is irretrievabl y broke n up.
"But the manufacturin g monopol y of Englan d is the pivot of the presen t social system of England .
Even while that monopol y lasted, th e market s could not keep pace with the increasin g productivity o f Englis h manufacturers ; the decennia l crises were the consequence .
And new market s are getting scarcer every day, so much so that even the Negroe s of the Congo are now to be forced int o the civilisatio n attendan t upon Mancheste r calicos , Staffordshire pottery , and Birmingha m hardware .
How will it be when Continental , and especiall y American , goods flow in in ever-increasing quantities—whe n the predominatin g share, still held by British manufacturers , will become reduce d from year to year? Answer , Free Trade , thou universa l panacea .
"I am not the first to point this out.
Alread y in 1883, at the Southport meetin g of the British Association, 2 2 Mr.
Inglis Pal-grave, th e Presiden t of the Economi c section , stated plainly that 'the days of great trade profits in Englan d were over, and there was a pause in the progres s of several great branche s of industria l labour.
The country might almost be said to be entering the non-progressive state.
'3 "But wha t is to be the consequence ? Capitalis t productio n cannot stop.
It must go on increasin g and expanding , or it must die.
Even now the mere reductio n of England' s lion's share in the supply of the world' s market s means stagnation , distress , excess of capital here, excess of unemploye d workpeopl e there.
What will it be when th e increas e of yearly productio n is brough t to a complet e stop? "Here i s the vulnerabl e place , the heel of Achilles , for capitalistic production .
Its very basis is the necessit y of constan t expansion, an d this constan t expansio n now become s impossible .
It ends in a deadlock .
Every year Englan d is brough t nearer face to face with the question : either the countr y must go to pieces , or capitalist productio n must.

"And th e workin g class? If even under the unparallele d commercial an d industria l expansion , from 1848 to 1868, they have had to underg o such misery ; if even then the great bulk of them experience d at best but a temporar y improvemen t of their condition, whil e only a small, privileged , 'protected ' minorit y was permanently benefited , what will it be when this dazzlin g period is brought finall y to a close; when the presen t dreary stagnatio n shall not only becom e intensified , but this, its intensifie d condition , shall become th e permanen t and norma l state of English trade? "The trut h is this: during the period of England' s industria l monopoly th e Englis h workin g class have, to a certain extent , shared i n the benefit s of the monopoly .
These benefit s were very unequally parcelle d out amongs t them; the privilege d minorit y pocketed most , but even the great mass had, at least, a temporar y share no w and then.
And that is the reason why, since the dying-out o f Owenism , there has been no Socialis m in England .
With the breakdow n of that monopoly , the English workin g class will lose that privilege d position ; it will find itself generally—th e privileged an d leadin g minorit y not excepted—o n a level with its fellow-workers abroad .
And that is the reason why there will be Socialism agai n in England.
" To this statemen t of the case, as that case appeare d to me in 1885, I have but little to add.
Needles s to say that to-day there is indeed "Socialis m again in England" , and plenty of it—Socialis m of all shades : Socialis m consciou s and unconscious , Socialis m prosaic an d poetic , Socialis m of the workin g class and of the middle class , for, verily , that abominatio n of abominations , Socialism, ha s not only becom e respectable , but has actuall y donned evenin g dress and lounge s lazily on drawing-roo m causeuses.
That show s the incurabl e ficklenes s of that terribl e despot o f "society" , middle-clas s public opinion , and once more justifies th e contemp t in which we Socialist s of a past generatio n always hel d that public opinion .
At the same time we have no reason t o grumbl e at the sympto m itself.
What I conside r far more importan t than this momentar y fashion amon g bourgeoi s circles of affectin g a mild dilutio n of Socialism, an d even more than the actual progres s Socialis m has made in Englan d generally , that is the revival of the East End of London.
Tha t immens e haunt of misery is no longer the stagnan t pool it was six years ago.
It has shaken off its torpid despair , has returned t o life, and has becom e the home of what is called the "New Unionism" , that is to say, of the organisatio n of the great mass of "unskilled " workers .
This organisatio n may to a great extent adop t the form of the old Union s of "skilled " worker s but it is essentiall y differen t in character .
The old Unions preserv e the traditions o f the time when they were founded , and look upon the wages syste m as a once-for-al l established , final fact, which they at best can modify in the interes t of their members .
The new Union s were founde d at a time when the faith in the eternit y of the wages system wa s severel y shaken ; their founder s and promoter s were Socialists eithe r consciousl y or by feeling ; the masses , whose adhesion gav e them strength , were rough, neglected , looked down upon by the working-clas s aristocracy ; but they had this immens e advantage, tha t their minds were virgin soil, entirel y free from the inherited "respectable " bourgeoi s prejudice s which hampere d the brains of the better situated "old" Unionists .
And thus we see now these ne w Union s taking the lead of the working-clas s movemen t generally, an d more and more taking in tow the rich and proud "old" Unions .
Undoubtedly, th e East Enders have committe d colossa l blun-ders; so have their predecessors , and so do the doctrinair e Socialists wh o pooh-poo h them.
A large class, like a great nation, never learn s better or quicke r than by undergoin g the consequ -ences of its own mistakes .
And for all the faults committe d in past, present an d future, the revival of the East End of Londo n remain s one of the greates t and most fruitful facts of this fin de siècle, and glad and proud I am to have lived to see it.

%, M• , • REPLY T O THE HONOURABL E GIOVANN I BOVIO ; In an article in La Tribuna o f Februar y 2 this year, the honourable Giovann i Bovio reproache s the Italian Republica n parliamentary deputies , who have latterly gone over to the royalis t camp, for treatin g too scornfull y the questio n of the form of government.
Thi s does not affect me directly .
What does affect me is that he deals with my article on Germa n socialis m (Critica Sociale, January 16 , 1892) a making the same reproac h agains t the German socialist s in genera l and agains t me in particular .
This is what he says on the matter 15: "Thus w e can see the error of those socialist s who, with Frederic k Engels, speak of the imminen t coming to power of socialis m and do not specify what kind of power.
Engels even establishe d with mathematica l argument s (and number s have for some time seemed to me a good argumen t in history ) the not too distant year in which the socialis t party will become the majorit y in the Germa n parliament .
So far so good.
And then? "—It wil l take power .
"—Even better .
But what power? Will it be monarchic , or republican , or will it go back to Weitling' s Utopia , supersede d by the Communist Manifesto o f Januar y 1848? "—The form s make no differenc e to us.
"—Really?.
.
.
Bu t you canno t speak of power except where the form is made concrete.
Yo u can say that the new substance , the new idea, will of itself create the form, produc e it from deep within itself, but you cannot , you must not, dispens e with the problem.
" To this I reply that I do not accept in the slightes t the honourable Mr .
Bovio's interpretation .
a See this volume , pp.
237-41.
— Ed.
b The followin g quotation s are given in Italian in the original.
— Ed.
For a start, I have never said the socialis t party will become the majority an d then procee d to take power.
On the contrary , I have expressly sai d that the odds are ten to one that our rulers, well before tha t point arrives , will use violenc e agains t us, and this would shif t us from the terrain of majorit y to the terrain of revolution.
Bu t let us pass over this.
"It will take power.
But what power? Will it be monarchic , or republican , or will it go back to Weitling' s Utopia , supersede d by the Communist Manifesto o f Januar y 1848?" Here I must permit myself the use of one of the honourabl e Mr.
Bovio' s own expressions .
He must really be a "man of the cloister" i f he has the slightes t doubt about the nature of this power.
All of governmental , aristocrati c and bourgeoi s German y reproaches ou r friends in the Reichsta g for being republican s and revolutionaries.
Marx an d I, for forty years, repeate d ad nausea m that for us the democrati c republi c is the only politica l form in which the struggle betwee n the workin g class and the capitalis t class can first be universalise d and then culminat e in the decisiv e victory of the proletariat.
The honourabl e Mr.
Bovio is surely not so naive as to believe that an empero r of German y would draw his minister s from the socialist part y and that, if he so desired , he would accept the conditions—implying abdication—withou t which those minister s could no t count on the suppor t of their party? But it is true that his fear of seeing us "go back to Weitling' s Utopia " gives me a fairly exalte d estimat e of my interlocutor' s naivety .
Or does the honourabl e Mr.
Bovio, in referrin g to Weitling, mean to imply that the Germa n socialist s attribut e no more importance t o the social form than to the politica l form? Again he would b e mistaken .
He should be well enough acquainte d with German socialis m to know that it demand s the socialisatio n of all the mean s of production .
How can this economi c revolutio n be accomplished? Tha t will depend on the circumstance s in which our part y seizes power, on the momen t at which and the manne r in which that occurs .
As Bovio says: "the new substance , the new idea, will of itself create the form, produc e it from deep withi n itself".
Meanwhile, i f tomorrow , by some accident , our party were called to power , I know perfectl y well what I would propos e as a programme o f action.
"The form s make no differenc e to us.
"? I should like to point out that it was neither I nor any other German socialis t who said that, or anythin g of the kind, but the honourable Mr .
Bovio and he alone.
I should certainl y like to know by what right he attribute s such "sciocchezza"a t o us.
For the rest, if the honourabl e Mr.
Bovio had waited for and read the second half of my article (Critica Sociale, February l), b perhaps h e would not have taken the troubl e of confusin g the German revolutionar y socialist s with the Italian royalis t Republi -cans.

PREFACE [TO TH E POLIS H EDITIO N (1892 ) OF THE MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY] The fact that a new Polish edition of the Communist Manifesto has becom e necessar y gives rise to variou s thoughts .
First of all, it is noteworth y that of late the Manifesto ha s becom e an index , as it were, of the developmen t of large-scal e industr y on the Europea n continent .
In proportio n as large-scal e industr y expands i n a given country , the deman d grows among the worker s of that country for enlightenmen t regardin g their positio n as the working clas s in relatio n to the possessin g classes , the socialis t movement spread s among them and the deman d for the Manifesto increases.
Thus , not only the state of the labour movemen t but also the degre e of developmen t of large-scal e industr y can be measured wit h fair accurac y in every countr y by the numbe r of copies of the Manifesto circulate d in the languag e of that country .
Accordingly, th e new Polish edition indicate s a decided progres s of Polish industry .
And there can be no doubt whateve r that this progress sinc e the previou s edition 3 publishe d ten years ago has actually take n place.
The Kingdo m of Poland , Congres s Poland, 245 has becom e the big industria l region of the Russia n Empire .
Whereas Russia n large-scal e industr y is scattere d sporadically— a part roun d the Gulf of Finland , anothe r in the centre (Mosco w and Vladimir) , a third along the coasts of the Black and Azov seas, and still others elsewhere—Polis h industr y has been packed into a relatively smal l area and enjoys both the advantage s and the disadvantages arisin g from such concentration .
The competin g Russian manufacturer s acknowledg e the advantage s when they demanded protectiv e tariffs agains t Poland, 246 in spite of their a K.

—Ed.
ardent desir e to transfor m the Poles into Russians .
The disadvan -tages— for the Polish manufacturer s and the Russia n govern -ment—are manifes t in the rapid spread of socialis t ideas among the Polis h worker s and in the growin g deman d for the Manifesto.
But the rapid developmen t of Polish industry , outstrippin g that of Russia , is in its turn a new proof of the inexhaustibl e vitality of the Polis h people and a new guarante e of its impendin g nationa l restoration.
An d the restoratio n of an independen t strong Poland is a matter which concern s not only the Poles but all of us.
A sincere internationa l collaboratio n of the Europea n nation s is possible onl y if each of these nation s is fully autonomou s in its own house .
The Revolutio n of 1848, which under the banner of the proletariat , after all, merely let the proletaria n fighter s do the work of the bourgeoisie , secure d the independenc e of Italy, Germany an d Hungary , among other things , throug h Louis Bonaparte an d Bismarck , its testamentar y executors ; but Poland , which sinc e 1792 had done more for the revolutio n than all these three together , was left to its own resource s when it succumbe d in 1863 to a tenfold greate r Russian force.
The nobility could neithe r maintain no r regai n Polis h independence ; today , to the bourgeoisie, thi s independenc e is, to say the least, immaterial .
Nevertheless, i t is a necessit y for the harmoniou s collaboratio n of the Europea n nations.
3 It can be gained only by the young Polish proletariat, an d in its hands it is secure.
For the worker s of all the rest of Europ e need the independenc e of Poland just as much as the Polis h worker s themselves .

275 [GREETINGS T O THE FRENC H WORKER S ON THE OCCASIO N OF THE 21ST ANNIVERSAR Y OF THE PARI S COMMUNE ] London, Marc h 17, 1892 Citizens an d citizenesses , Twenty-one year s ago today the people of Paris raised the red flag, in defianc e of both the French tricolou r flying at Versaille s and the Germa n tricolou r flying over the forts occupie d by the Prussians.
The red flag was the Paris proletaria t rising to a height from which conqueror s and conquere d alike disappeared .
What constitute s the histori c grandeu r of the Commun e is its eminently internationa l character .
It is the bold challeng e which it made to every sentimen t of bourgeoi s chauvinism .
The proletaria t of all countrie s was not mistaken .
Let the bourgeoi s celebrat e their July 14 or their Septembe r 22.
247 The holida y of the proletariat , everywhere an d always , will be March 18.
Hence th e vile slander s which the vile bourgeoisi e has heaped on the tomb of the Commune .
But hence, also, the Internationa l Association o f Workin g Men, which alone dared to identif y itself from the very first day with the Paris insurgent s and, until the last day and thereafter , with the defeate d proletarians .
It is true that where th e Commun e succumbed , the Internationa l was not able to survive: t o the cry of "At the Communards! " it was smashe d from one end of Europ e to the other.
Well! Twenty-on e years have passed since the recaptur e of the cannons o n the hill of Monmartre.
3 The childre n born in 1871 have now reache d their majority , and thanks to the stupidit y of the rulin g classes they are soldiers, learnin g to handle arms, the art a See this volume , p.

of organisin g themselve s and defendin g themselves , gun in hand.
The Commun e which they claime d to have killed, the Internation -al which they imagine d they had wiped out forever , are here in our midst , alive and twenty times more powerfu l than in 1871.
Those respondin g to our call have grown from hundred s into thousands, an d from thousand s into millions .
The union of the world proletariat , which the First Internationa l was able to predic t and prepare , is today a reality.
And, what is more, the sons of the Prussian soldier s who occupie d the forts surroundin g the Paris of the Commun e in 1871 are today fightin g in their million s in the front line , side by side with the sons of the Communards ; for the complete an d lasting liberatio n of the workin g class.

20-1550 INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLIS H EDITIO N (1892 ) OF SOCIALISM: UTOPIAN AND SCIENTIFIC 249 The presen t little book is, originally , a part of a large whole.
About 1875 , Dr.
E.
Dühring, privatdocent at Berlin University , suddenly an d rather clamorousl y announce d his conversio n to socialism, an d presente d the Germa n public not only with an elaborate socialis t theory , but also with a complet e practica l plan for the reorganisatio n of society .
As a matter of course , he fell foul of his predecessors ; above all, he honoure d Marx by pourin g out upon him the full vials of his wrath.
This too k place about the time when the two section s of the Socialist Part y in Germany—Eisenacher s and Lassalleans 250—had just effecte d their fusion, and thus obtaine d not only an immens e increase o f strength , but, what was more, the faculty of employin g the whol e of this strengt h agains t the commo n enemy .
The Socialist Part y in German y was fast becomin g a power.
But to make it a power, the first conditio n was that the newly-conquere d unity shoul d not be imperilled .
And Dr.
Dühring openly pro -ceeded t o form aroun d himsel f a sect, the nucleu s of a future separate party .
It thus becam e necessar y to take up the gauntle t thrown dow n to us, and to fight out the struggl e whethe r we liked it or not.
This, however , though it might not be an overdifficult , was evidently a long-winded , business .
As is well known , we German s are of a terribly ponderou s Gründlichkeit, radical profundit y or profound radicality , whateve r you may like to call it.
Wheneve r any one of us expound s what he consider s a new doctrine , he has first to elaborat e it into an all-comprisin g system .
He has to prove that both the first principle s of logic and the fundamenta l laws of the univers e had existed from all eternity for no other purpos e than to ultimatel y lead to this newly-discovered , crownin g theory .

Diihring , in this respect , was quite up to the nationa l mark.
Nothin g less than a complet e System of Philosophy, mental , moral, natural , and historical ; a complet e System of Political Economy and Socialism; and , finally, a Critical History of Political Economy*—three bi g volume s in octavo , heavy extrinsicall y and intrinsically, thre e army corps of argument s mobilise d agains t all previous philosopher s and economist s in general , and agains t Marx in particular—i n fact, an attemp t at a complet e "revolutio n in science"—thes e were what I should have to tackle.
I had to treat of all and every possibl e subject , from the concept s of time and spac e to Bimetallism 251; from the eternit y of matter and motion t o the perishabl e nature of moral ideas; from Darwin' s natural selectio n to the educatio n of youth in a future society .
Anyhow, th e systemati c comprehensivenes s of my opponen t gave me the opportunit y of developing , in oppositio n to him, and in a more connecte d form than had previousl y been done, the views held by Marx and myself on this great variety of subjects .
And that was the principa l reason which made me undertak e this otherwise ungratefu l task.
My reply was first publishe d in a series of articles in the Leipzig Vorwärts, the chief organ of the socialis t party, and later on as a book: Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der Wissenschaft (Mr.
E.
Dühring's Revolution in Science), a second edition of which appeared i n Zurich , 1886.
At the reques t of my friend, Paul Lafargue , now representativ e of Lille in the Frenc h Chambe r of Deputies , I arrange d three chapters o f this book as a pamphlet , which he translate d and published i n 1880, under the title: Socialisme utopique et socialisme scientifique '.
252 From this French text Polish and Spanis h edition s were prepared .
In 1883, our Germa n friend s brough t out the pamphlet i n the origina l language .
Italian, Russian , Danish , Dutch, and Roumania n translations , based upon the Germa n text, have since bee n published .
Thus, with the presen t English edition , this little boo k circulate s in ten languages .
I am not aware that any other socialis t work, not even our Communist Manifesto o f 1848 or Marx's Capital, ha s been so often translated .
In German y it has had four edition s of about 20,000 copies in all.
The Appendix , "The Mark" , was written with the intentio n of spreading amon g the Germa n Socialis t Party some elementar y a This refers to E.
Dühring's books: Cursus der Philosophie als streng wis­ senschaftlicher Weltanschauung und Lebensgestaltung; Cursus der National-und Socialökonomie einschliesslich der Hauptpunkte der Finanzpolitik; Kritische Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und der Socialismus.
— Ed knowledge o f the history and developmen t of landed propert y in Germany.
Thi s seemed all the more necessar y at a time when the assimilation b y that party of the workin g people of the towns was in a fair way of completion , and when the agricultura l labourer s and peasant s had to be taken in hand.
This appendi x has been included i n the translation , as the origina l forms of tenure of land common t o all Teutoni c tribes, and the history of their decay, are even less known in Englan d than in Germany .
I have left the text as it stands in the original , withou t alludin g to the hypothesi s recently starte d by Maxim Kovalevsky , accordin g to which the partition o f the arable and meado w lands among the member s of the Mark was precede d by their being cultivate d for joint-accoun t by a large patriarcha l family communit y embracin g severa l generations (a s exemplifie d by the still existin g South Slavonia n Zadruga), an d that the partition , later on, took place when the community ha d increased , so as to becom e too unwield y for joint-account management.
3 Kovalevsk y is probabl y quite right, but the matte r is still sub judice^ The economi c terms used in this work, as far as they are new, agree wit h those used in the English edition of Marx's Capital}5* We call "productio n of commodities " that economi c phase where articles ar e produce d not only for the use of the producers , but also for purpose s of exchange ; that is, as commodities, no t as use values.
Thi s phase extend s from the first beginning s of productio n for exchang e down to our presen t time; it attains its full development unde r capitalis t productio n only, that is, under conditions wher e the capitalist , the owner of the means of production, employs , for wages, labourers , people deprive d of all means o f productio n except their own labour-power , and pocket s the exces s of the selling price of the product s over his outlay.
We divide th e history of industria l productio n since the Middle Ages into thre e periods : (1) handicraft , small master craftsme n with a few journeyme n and apprentices , where each laboure r produce s the complet e article ; (2) manufacture , where greate r number s of workmen, groupe d in one large establishment , produc e the complete articl e on the principl e of divisio n of labour , each workman performin g only one partia l operation , so that the product i s complet e only after having passed successivel y throug h the hand s of all; (3) moder n industry , where the produc t is produced b y machiner y driven by power , and where the work of a Engels refers to M.

But if we Continental s had taken the slightes t notice of the prejudices o f British "respectability"; b we should be even worse off than w e are.

Thus, from a sensual, it passes into an intellectua l entity; but thus, too, it evolves al l the consistency , regardles s of consequences , characteris -tic of the intellect .
"Hobbes, a s Bacon' s continuator , argues thus: if all human knowledge i s furnishe d by the senses, then our concept s and ideas are but the phantoms , diveste d of their sensual forms, of the real world.
Philosoph y can but give names to these phantoms .
One name ma y be applied to more than one of them.
There may even be name s of names .
It would imply a contradictio n if, on the one hand, w e maintaine d that all ideas had their origin in the world of sensation, and , on the other, that a word was more than a word; that beside s the beings known to us by our senses, beings which are one and all individuals , there existed also beings of a general , not individual , nature .
An unbodil y substanc e is the same absurdity a s an unbodil y body.
Body, being, substance , are but different term s for the same reality .
It is impossible to separate thought from matter that thinks.
Thi s matter is the substratu m of all changes goin g on in the world.
The word infinite is meaningless , unless it states that our mind is capable of performin g an endles s into the Germa n word somethin g of the meanin g of the Latin qualitas; hi s "qual" was the activatin g principl e arisin g from, and promotin g in its turn, the spontaneous developmen t of the thing, relation , or person subjec t to it, in contradistinction t o a pain inflicte d from without.

I f Englishme n nowaday s do not exactly relish the compliment h e paid their ancestors , more's the pity.
It is none the less undeniabl e that Bacon, Hobbes , and Locke are the fathers of that brillian t school of Frenc h materialist s which made the eighteenth century , in spite of all battles on land and sea won over Frenchmen b y German s and Englishmen , a pre-eminentl y French century, eve n before that crownin g French Revolution , the results of which we outsiders , in Englan d as well as in Germany , are still trying to acclimatise .

But Englan d has been "civilised " since then.
The exhibitio n of 1851257 sounde d the knell of Englis h insula r exclusiveness .
England becam e graduall y internationalised—i n diet, in manners , in ideas ; so much so that I begin to wish that some Englis h manners an d custom s had made as much headwa y on the Continent a s other continenta l habits have made here.
Anyhow , the introductio n and spread of salad-oi l (before 1851 known only to the aristocracy ) has been accompanie d by a fatal spread of continental scepticis m in matter s religious , and it has come to this, that agnosticism , though not yet considere d "the thing" quite as much as the Church of England , is yet very nearly on a par, as far as respectabilit y goes, with Baptism , and decidedl y ranks above the Salvation Army .
And I cannot help believin g that under these circumstances i t will be consolin g to many who sincerel y regret and condem n this progres s of infidelit y to learn that these "new-fangled notions " are not of foreign origin, are not "made in Germany", lik e so many other article s of daily use, but are undoubtedly Ol d English , and that their British originator s two hundred year s ago went a good deal furthe r than their descendants no w dare to venture .
What, indeed , is agnosticism , but, to use an expressiv e Lanca -shire term, 3 "shamefaced " materialism ? The agnostic' s conceptio n of Natur e is materialisti c throughout .
The entire natura l world is governed b y law, and absolutel y exclude s the interventio n of action fro m without .
But, he adds, we have no means either of ascertaining o r of disprovin g the existenc e of some Suprem e Being beyon d the known universe .
Now, this might hold good at the time when Laplace , to Napoleon' s question , why in the great astronomer's Mécanique céleste 0 the Creato r was not even men-tioned, proudl y replied : "Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse.
" 0 But nowadays, i n our evolutionar y conception of the universe , there is absolutel y no room for either a Creator or a Ruler; and to talk of a Suprem e Being shut out from the whole existin g world, implies a contradictio n in terms , and, as it seems to me, a gratuitous insul t to the feeling s of religiou s people .
Again, ou r agnosti c admits that all our knowledg e is based upon the informatio n imparte d to us by our senses.
But, he adds, how do we know that our senses give us correct representation s of the a In Die Neue Zeit the phras e "to use an expressiv e Lancashir e term" is omitted.

objects w e perceiv e throug h them? And he proceed s to inform us that, wheneve r he speaks of objects or their qualities , he does in reality no t mean these objects and qualities , of which he canno t know anythin g for certain , but merely the impression s which they have produce d on his senses.
Now, this line of reasonin g seems undoubtedly har d to beat by mere argumentation .
But before there wa s argumentation , there was action.
Im Anfang war die That.
3 And huma n action had solved the difficult y long before human ingenuit y invente d it.
The proof of the puddin g is in the eating.
Fro m the momen t we turn to our own use these objects , according t o the qualitie s we perceiv e in them, we put to an infallible tes t the correctnes s or otherwis e of our sense -perceptions.
I f these perception s have been wrong , then our estimate o f the use to which an object can be turned must also be wrong, an d our attemp t must fail.
But if we succee d in accomplishing ou r aim, if we find that the object does agree with our idea of it, and does answer the purpos e we intende d it for, then tha t is positiv e proof that our perception s of it and of its qualities, 5 0 far, agre e with reality outside ourselves .
And wheneve r we find ourselve s face to face with a failure, then we generall y are not long in makin g out the cause that made us fail; we find that the perceptio n upon which we acted was either incomplet e and superficial, o r combine d with the results of other perception s in a way not warrante d by them—wha t we call defectiv e reasoning.
13 So long as we take care to train and to use our senses properly , and to keep our action within the limits prescribe d by perception s properly mad e and properl y used, so long we shall find that the result of our action proves the conformit y of our perception s with the objectiv e nature of the things perceived .
Not in one single instance, s o far, have we been led to the conclusio n that our sense-perceptions, scientificall y controlled , induce in our minds ideas respectin g the outer world that are, by their very nature , at variance wit h reality , or that there is an inheren t incompatibilit y between th e outer world and our sense-perception s of it.
But then come the Neo-Kantia n agnostic s and say: We may correctly perceiv e the qualitie s of a thing, but we cannot by any sensible o r mental process grasp the thing-in-itself .
This "thing-in -itself" is beyond our ken.
To this Hegel, long since, has replied : If a "In the beginnin g was the deed" (see Goethe , Faust, Par t I, Scene 3, "Faust' s Study").
— Ed.
b In Die Neue Zeit the word s "what we call defectiv e reasoning " are omitted.
— Ed.
you kno w all the qualitie s of a thing, you know the thing itself; nothing remain s but the fact that the said thing exists withou t us; and whe n your senses have taught you that fact, you have graspe d the last remnan t of the thing-in-itself , Kant's celebrate d unknow -able Ding an sich.
To whic h it may be added that in Kant's time our knowledge o f natura l objects was indeed so fragmentar y that he might wel l suspect , behind the little we knew about each of them, a mysteriou s "thing-in-itself" .
But one after anothe r these ungraspable thing s have been grasped , analyse d and, what is more, reproduced b y the giant progres s of science ; and what we can produce, w e certainl y canno t conside r as unknowable .
To the chemistry o f the first half of this century organi c substance s were such mysteriou s objects ; now we learn to build them up one after another fro m their chemica l element s withou t the aid of organi c processes.
Moder n chemist s declare that as soon as the chemica l constitution o f no matter what body is known , it can be built up from its elements .
We are still far from knowin g the constitutio n of the highes t organi c substances , the albuminou s bodies ; but there is no reason why we should not, if only after centuries , arrive a t that knowledg e and, armed with it, produc e artificia l albumen.
Bu t if we arrive at that, we shall at the same time have produced organi c life, for life, from its lowest to its highest forms, is but the norma l mode of existenc e of albuminou s bodies .
As soon, however , as our agnosti c has made these formal mental reservations, h e talks and acts as the rank materialis t he at bottom is.
He may say that, as far as we know , matter and motion , or as it is now called , energy , can neithe r be created nor destroyed , but that we have no proof of their not having been create d at some time or other.
But if you try to use this admissio n agains t him in any particula r case, he will quickly put you out of court.
If he admits th e possibilit y of spiritualis m in abstracto, he will have none of it in concreto.
As far as we know and can know, he will tell you there is no Creato r and no Ruler of the universe ; as far as we are concerned, matte r and energ y can neithe r be create d nor annihilated; fo r us, mind is a mode of energy , a function of the brain; al l we know is that the materia l world is governe d by immutable laws , and so forth.
Thus, as far as he is a scientifi c man, as far as he knows anything , he is a materialist ; outside his science, i n sphere s about which he knows nothing , he translate s his ignorance int o Greek and calls it agnosticism .
At all events, one thing seems clear: even if I was an agnostic , it is eviden t that I could not describ e the conceptio n of history sketched ou t in this little book as "historica l agnosticism" .
Religious peopl e would laugh at me, agnostic s would indignantl y ask, was I going to make fun of them? And thus I hope even British respectability 3 will not be overshocke d if I use, in Englis h as well as in so many other languages , the term "historica l materialism", t o designat e that view of the course of history which seeks th e ultimat e cause and the great movin g power of all important histori c events in the economi c developmen t of society , in the change s in the modes of productio n and exchange , in the consequent divisio n of society into dist'inc t classes , and in the struggles o f these classes against one another .
This indulgenc e will perhap s be accorde d to me all the sooner if I show that historica l materialis m may be of advantag e even to British respectability.
b I have mentione d the fact that about forty or fifty years ago, any cultivate d foreigne r settling in Englan d was struck by what he was then bound to conside r the religiou s bigotry and stupidit y of the Englis h respectabl e middle class.
I am now going to prove that the respectabl e Englis h middl e class of that time wa s not quite as stupid as it looked to the intelligen t foreigner.
It s religiou s leaning s can be explained .
When Europ e emerge d from the Middle Ages, the rising middle classc of the towns constitute d its revolutionar y element .
It had conquered a recognise d positio n within medieva l feudal organisa -tion, bu t this position , also, had becom e too narrow for its expansive power .
The development d of the middl e class, the bourgeoisie, becam e incompatibl e with the maintenanc e of the feudal system ; the feudal system , therefore , had to fall.
But the great internationa l centre of feudalis m was the Roman Catholic Church .
It united the whole of feudalise d Wester n Europe, i n spite of all interna l wars, into one grand politica l system, oppose d as much to the schismati c Greek s as to the Mohammedan countries .
It surrounde d feuda l institution s with the halo of divine consecration .
It had organise d its own hierarch y on the feudal model , and, lastly, it was itself by far the most powerful feuda l lord, holding , as it did, full one-thir d of the soil of the Catholi c world .
Befor e profan e feudalis m could be a In Die Neue Zeit there follo w the words : "which in Germa n is called philistinism".

successfully attacke d in each countr y and in detail, this, its sacred central organisation , had to be destroyed .
Moreover, paralle l with the rise of the middle class went on the great reviva l of science ; astronomy , mechanics , physics , anatomy , physiology, wer e again cultivated .
And the bourgeoisie , for the development o f its industria l production , require d a science which ascertained th e physica l propertie s of natura l objects and the modes o f action of the forces of Nature .
Now up to then science had but been the humbl e handmai d of the Church , had not been allowed t o overste p the limits set by faith, and for that reason had been no scienc e at all.
Science rebelle d agains t the Church ; the bourgeoisie coul d not do withou t science , and, therefore , had to join in the rebellion .
The above , though touchin g but two of the points where the rising middl e class was bound to come into collisio n with the established religion , will be sufficien t to show, first, that the class most directl y intereste d in the struggl e agains t the pretension s of the Roma n Churc h was the bourgeoisie ; and second , that every struggle agains t feudalism , at that time, had to take on a religiou s disguise, ha d to be directe d agains t the Churc h in the first instance.
Bu t if the universitie s and the traders of the cities started the cry, it was sure to find, and did find, a strong echo in the masses o f the countr y people , the peasants , who everywher e had to struggl e for their very existenc e with their feudal lords, spiritua l and temporal .
The long 3 fight of the bourgeoisi e against feudalis m culminate d in three great, decisiv e battles .
The firs t was what is called the Protestan t Reformatio n in Germany.
Th e war-cr y raised agains t the Churc h by Luther was responded t o by two insurrection s of a political nature: first, that of the lower nobility under Franz von Sickinge n (1523) , then the great Peasants ' War, 1525.
258 Both were defeated , chiefly in consequence o f the indecisio n of the parties most interested , the burghers o f the towns—a n indecisio n into the causes of which we cannot her e enter.
From that momen t the struggl e degenerate d into a fight betwee n the local princes and the central power, b and ended b y blottin g out Germany , for two hundre d years, from the politically activ e nation s of Europe .
The Luthera n Reformatio n produced a new creed indeed , a religion adapte d to absolut e a Instead of "long" Die Neue Zeit has "great".

N o sooner were the peasant s of North-Eas t German y converted t o Lutheranis m than they were from freeme n reduce d to serfs.
But wher e Luther failed, Calvin won the day.
Calvin's creed was one fit for the boldes t of the bourgeoisi e of his time.
His predestination doctrin e was the religiou s expressio n of the fact that in the commercia l world of competitio n succes s or failure does not depen d upon a man's activity or cleverness , but upon circumstances uncontrollabl e by him.
It is not of him that willeth or of him that runneth , but of the mercy of unknow n superio r economic powers ; and this was especiall y true at a period of economic revolution , when all old commercia l routes and centre s were replace d by new ones, when India and Americ a were opened to the world, and when even the most sacred economi c articles of faith—the valu e of gold and silver—bega n to totter and to break down.
Calvin' s church constitutio n was thoroughl y democrati c and republican; an d where the kingdo m of God was republicanised , could th e kingdom s of this world remai n subjec t to monarchs , bishops an d lords? While Germa n Lutheranis m becam e a willing tool in the hands of princes, 3 Calvinis m founde d a republi c in Holland, an d active republica n parties in England , and, above all, Scotland.
In Calvinism , the second great bourgeoi s upheava l found its doctrine read y cut and dried .
This upheava l took place in England.
Th e middl e class of the towns brough t it on, and the yeomanryb o f the countr y district s fough t it out.
Curiousl y enough, i n all the three great bourgeoi s risings, 0 the peasantr y furnishes th e army that has to do the fighting ; and the peasantr y is just the class that, the victory once gained , is most surely ruined by the economi c consequence s of that victory .
A hundre d years after Cromwell , the yeomanr y of Englan d had almost disappeared .
Anyhow, ha d it not been for that yeomanr y and for the plebeian element i n the towns, d the bourgeoisi e alone would never have fought th e matter out to the bitter end, and would never have brought Charle s I to the scaffold .

conquests of the bourgeoisi e that were ripe for gatherin g at the time, the revolutio n had to be carried considerabl y further — exactly as in 1793 in France and in 1848 in Germany .
This seems, in fact, to be one of the laws of evolutio n of bourgeoi s society .
Well, upo n this excess of revolutionar y activity there necessaril y followed the inevitabl e reactio n which in its turn went beyond the point wher e it might have maintaine d itself.
3 After a series of oscillations, the new centre of gravity was at last attaine d and became a new starting-point .
The grand period of English history , known to respectability 0 under the name of "the Great Rebellion" , and the struggle s succeedin g it, were brough t to a close by the comparatively pun y event c entitle d by Liberal historians , "the Glorious Revolution".
259 The new starting-poin t was a compromis e betwee n the rising middle clas s d and ex-feuda l landowners .
The latter, though called, as now, the aristocracy , had been long since on the way which led them to become what Louis Philipp e in France becam e at a much later period , "the first bourgeoi s of the kingdom" .
Fortunatel y for England, the old feudal barons had killed one another during the Wars of the Roses.
260 Their successors , though mostly scions of the old families , had been so much out of the direct line of descent that they constitute d quite a new body, with habits and tendencie s far more bourgeoi s than feudal .
They fully understoo d the value of money , and at once began to increase their rents by turning hundreds of small farmer s out and replacin g them by sheep.
Henry VIII , while squanderin g the Church lands, created fresh bourgeois landlord s by wholesale ; the innumerabl e confiscation s of estates, regrante d to absolute or relative upstarts , and continue d during the whole of the seventeent h century , had the same result.
Consequently, eve r since Henry VII, the English "aristocracy" , far from counteractin g the developmen t of industria l production , had, on the contrary , sought to indirectl y profit thereby ; and there had always bee n a section of the great landowner s willing , from economical or political reasons , to co-operat e with the leading men of the financia l and industria l bourgeoisie .
The compromis e of 1689 was, therefore , easily accomplished .

"pelf an d place" 3 were left to the great landownin g families , provided th e economi c interest s of the financial , manufacturing , and commercia l middle class were sufficientl y attende d to.
And these economi c interest s were at that time powerfu l enoug h to determine th e genera l policy of the nation .
There might be squabbles abou t matter s of detail , but, on the whole , the aristocratic oligarch y knew too well that its own economi c prosperity wa s irretrievabl y bound up with that of the industria l and commercia l middle class.
From tha t time, the bourgeoisi e was a humble , but still a recognised componen t of the ruling classes of England .
With the rest of them, it had a commo n interes t in keepin g in subjectio n the grea t workin g mass of the nation .
The merchan t or manufacturer himsel f stood in the positio n of master , or, as it was until latel y called , of "natura l superior " to his clerks , his workpeople, hi s domesti c servants .
His interes t was to get as much and as good work out of them as he could; for this end they had to be trained to proper submission .
He was himself religious ; his religion ha d supplie d the standar d under which he had fought the king an d the lords ; he was not long in discoverin g the opportunities thi s same religio n offered him for workin g upon the minds of his natural inferiors , and makin g them submissiv e to the behests o f the master s it had please d God to place over them.
In short, th e English bourgeoisi e now had to take a part in keepin g down th e "lower orders" , the great producin g mass of the nation , and one of the means employe d for that purpos e was the influence o f religion .
There wa s anothe r fact that contribute d to strengthe n the religious leaning s of the bourgeoisie .
That was the rise of materialism i n England .
This new b doctrin e not only shocke d the pious feeling s of the middl e class; it announce d itself as a philosophy onl y fit for scholar s and cultivate d men of the world, in contras t to religio n which was good enoug h for the uneducate d masses, includin g the bourgeoisie .
With Hobbe s it stepped on the stage as a defende r of royal prerogativ e and omnipotence ; it called upon absolut e monarch y to keep down that puer robustus sed malitiosus, 261 to wit, the people .
Similarly , with the successor s of Hobbes, wit h Bolingbroke , Shaftesbury , etc.
, the new deistic form of materialis m remaine d an aristocratic , esoteri c doctrine , and, a Die Neue Zeit has "posts , sinecur e and high salary " instead of "pelf and place".

21-1550 therefore, hatefu l to the middle class both for its religiou s heresy and for its anti-bourgeoi s politica l connections .
Accordingly , in opposition t o the materialis m and deism of the aristocracy , those Protestant sect s whjch had furnishe d the flag and the fightin g contingent agains t the Stuarts , continue d to furnis h the main strength o f the progressiv e middle class, and form even today the backbone o f "the Great Liberal Party" .
In the meantim e materialis m passe d from Englan d to France , where it met and coalesce d with anothe r materialisti c school of philosophers, a branch of Cartesianism.
262 In France , too, it remained a t first an exclusivel y aristocrati c doctrine .
But soon its revolutionary characte r asserte d itself.
The French materialist s did not limi t their criticis m to matter s of religiou s belief; they extended i t to whateve r scientifi c traditio n or politica l institutio n they me t with; and to prove the claim of their doctrin e to universal application , they took the shortes t cut, and boldly applied it to all subject s of knowledg e in the giant work after which the y were named—th e Encyclopédie.
Thus, in one or the other of its two forms—avowe d materialis m or deism—i t became the creed of the whole culture d youth of France ; so much so that, when th e great Revolutio n broke out, the doctrin e hatche d by English Royalist s gave a theoretica l flag to French Republican s and Terrorists, an d furnishe d the text for the Declaratio n of the Rights o f Man.
263 The grea t French Revolutio n was the third uprisin g of the bourgeoisie, bu t the first that had entirel y cast off the religiou s cloak, an d was fought out on undisguise d politica l lines; it was the first, too , that was really fought out up to the destructio n of one of the combatants , the aristocracy , and the complet e triump h of the other , the bourgeoisie .
In Englan d the continuit y of pre-revolutionary an d post-revolutionar y institutions , and the com-promise betwee n landlord s and capitalists , found its expressio n in the continuit y of judicia l precedent s and in the religiou s preserva -tion of the feudal forms of the law.
In France the Revolutio n constituted a complet e breach with the tradition s of the past; it cleared ou t the very last vestige s of feudalism , and created in the Code Civil264 a masterl y adaptatio n of the old Roman law—tha t almost perfec t expressio n of the juridica l relation s correspondin g to the economi c stage called by Marx the productio n of commodities—to moder n capitalisti c conditions ; so masterl y that this Frenc h revolutionar y code still serves as a model for reform s of the law of propert y in all other countries , not exceptin g England.
Le t us, however , not forget that if English law continue s to expres s the economi c relation s of capitalisti c society in that barbarous feuda l languag e which correspond s to the thing expressed, jus t as English spellin g correspond s to English pronun -ciation— vous écrivez Londres et vous prononcez Constantinople? sai d a Frenchman—that sam e Englis h law is the only one which has preserved throug h ages, and transmitte d to Americ a and the Colonies, th e best part of that old Germani c persona l freedom , local self-governmen t and independenc e from all interferenc e but that of the law courts , which on the Continen t has been lost during th e period of absolut e monarchy , and has nowher e been as yet fully recovered .
To retur n to our British bourgeois .
The French Revolutio n gave him a splendi d opportunity , with the help of the continenta l monarchies, t o destro y Frenc h maritim e commerce , to annex French colonies , and to crush the last French pretension s to maritime rivalry .
That was one reason why he fought it.
Anothe r was that the ways of this revolutio n went very much agains t his grain.
No t only its "execrable " terrorism , but the very attemp t to carry bourgeoi s rule to extremes .
What should the Britis h bourgeois d o withou t his aristocracy , that taught him manners , such as they were, and invente d fashion s for him—tha t furnishe d officers fo r the army, which kept order at home, and the navy, which conquere d colonia l possession s and new market s abroad ? There wa s indeed a progressiv e minorit y of the bourgeoisie , that minority whos e interest s were not so well attende d to under the compromise; thi s section , compose d chiefly of the less wealth y middle class , did sympathis e with the Revolution, 265 but it was powerless i n Parliament .
Thus, if materialis m becam e the creed of the French Revolution , the God-fearin g Englis h bourgeoi s held all the faster to his religion.
Ha d not the reign of terror in Paris proved what was the upshot, i f the religiou s instinct s of the masses were lost? The more materialism sprea d from Franc e to neighbourin g countries , and was reinforce d by similar doctrina l currents , notably by Germa n philosophy, th e more, in fact, materialis m and free though t generally became , on the Continent , the necessar y qualification s of a cultivate d man, the more stubbornl y the Englis h middl e class stuck to its manifol d religiou s creeds .
These creeds might differ from on e another , but they were, all of them, distinctl y religious , Christian creeds .

"— Ed 21* While th e Revolutio n ensure d the politica l triump h of the bourgeoisie i n France , in Englan d Watt, Arkwright , Cartwright , and other s initiate d an industria l revolution , which completel y shifted th e centre of gravity of economi c power.
The wealth of the bourgeoisie increase d considerabl y faster than that of the landed aristocracy.
Withi n the bourgeoisi e itself, the financia l aristocracy , the bankers , etc.
, were more and more pushe d into the background b y the manufacturers .
The compromis e of 1689, even after the gradua l change s it had undergon e in favour of the bourgeoisie, n o longer corresponde d to the relative positio n of the parties t o it.
The characte r of these parties , too, had changed ; the bourgeoisie o f 1830 was very differen t from that of the precedin g century.
Th e politica l power still left to the aristocracy , and used by them to resist the pretension s of the new industria l bourgeoisie , became incompatibl e with the new economi c interests .
A fresh struggle wit h the aristocrac y was necessary ; it could end only in a victory o f the new economi c power.
First, the Reform Act 266 was pushed through , in spite of all resistance , under the impuls e of the Frenc h Revolutio n of 1830.
It gave to the bourgeoisi e a recognised an d powerfu l place in Parliament .
Then the Repeal of the Corn Laws, which settled , once for all, the supremac y of the bourgeoisie, an d especiall y of its most active portion , the manufacturers, ove r the landed aristocracy .
This was the greates t victory o f the bourgeoisie ; it was, however , also the last it gained in its own exclusiv e interest .
Whateve r triumph s it obtaine d later on, it had to share with a new social power, first its ally, but soon its rival.
The industria l revolutio n had create d a class of large manufac -turing capitalists , but also a class—an d a far more numerou s one—of manufacturin g workpeople .
This class graduall y in-creased i n numbers , in proportio n as the industria l revolutio n seized upo n one branch of manufactur e after another , and in the same proportio n it increase d in power .
This power it proved as early as 1824, by forcing a reluctan t Parliamen t to repeal the acts forbidding combination s of workmen.
267 Durin g the Refor m agitation, th e workin g men constitute d the Radica l wing of the Reform party ; the Act of 1832 having exclude d them from the suffrage, the y formulate d their demand s in the People' s Charter, 268 and constitute d themselves , in oppositio n to the great bourgeoi s Anti-Corn La w party, 269 into an independen t party, the Chartists , the first workin g men's party of moder n times.
Then cam e the continenta l revolution s of Februar y and March , 1848, in which the workin g people played such a prominen t part, and, at least in Paris, put forwar d demand s which were certainl y inadmissible fro m the point of view of capitalis t society.
And then came the genera l reaction .
First the defeat of the Chartist s on the 10th April , 1848, then the crushin g of the Paris workin g men's insurrection i n June of the same year, then the disaster s of 1849 in Italy, Hungary , South Germany , and at last the victory of Louis Bonaparte ove r Paris, 2nd December , 1851.
For a time, at least, the bugbea r of working-clas s pretension s was put down, but at what cost ! If the British bourgeoi s had been convince d before of the necessit y of maintainin g the commo n peopl e in a religiou s mood, ho w much more must he feel that necessit y after all these experiences? Regardles s of the sneers of his continenta l compeers , he continue d to spend thousand s and tens of thousands , year after year, upo n the evangelisatio n of the lower orders; not content with his own native religiou s machinery , he appeale d to Brothe r Jonathan, th e greates t organise r in existenc e of religion as a trade, and importe d from Americ a revivalism , Moody and Sankey , and the like 270; and, finally, he accepte d the dangerou s aid of the Salvation Army , which revives the propagand a of early Christiani -ty, appeal s to the poor as the elect, fights capitalis m in a religiou s way, an d thus foster s an elemen t of early Christia n class antagonism, whic h one day may becom e troublesom e to the well-to-do peopl e who now find the ready money for it.
It seems a law of historica l developmen t that the bourgeoisi e can in no Europea n countr y get hold of politica l power—a t least for any lengt h of time—i n the same exclusiv e way in which the feudal aristocracy kep t hold of it during the Middl e Ages.
Even in France, wher e feudalis m was completel y extinguished , the bourgeoisie, a s a whole, has held full possessio n of the Govern -ment for very short period s only.
During Louis Philippe' s reign, 1830-48, a very small portio n of the bourgeoisi e ruled the kingdom; b y far the larger part were exclude d from the suffrag e by the high qualification .
Under the Secon d Republic , 1848-51 , the whol e bourgeoisi e ruled, but for three years only; their incapacity brough t on the Second Empire .
It is only now, in the Third Republic , that the bourgeoisi e as a whole have kept possession o f the helm for more than twenty years; and they are already showin g lively signs of decadence .
A durable reign of the bourgeoisie ha s been possibl e only in countrie s like America , where feudalis m was unknown , and society at the very beginnin g started fro m a bourgeoi s basis.
And even in France and America , the successor s of the bourgeoisie , the workin g people , are already knocking a t the door.
In England , the bourgeoisi e never held undivide d sway.
Even the victor y of 1832 left the landed aristocrac y in almost exclusiv e possession o f all the leadin g Governmen t offices.
The meeknes s with whic h the wealth y middle class submitte d to this, remaine d inconceivable t o me until the great Libera l manufacturer , Mr.
W.
A.
Forster, i n a public speech implore d the young men of Bradford t o learn French , as a means to get on in the world, and quoted fro m his own experienc e how sheepis h he looked when, as a Cabine t Minister , he had to move in society where French was, at least, as necessar y as English ! The fact was, the English middle class of that time were, as a rule, quite uneducate d upstarts , and could no t help leavin g to the aristocrac y those superio r Govern -ment place s where other qualification s were require d than mere insular narrownes s and insula r conceit , seasone d by busines s sharpness.
* Eve n now the endles s newspape r debate s about middle-class educatio n show that the English middle class does not yet conside r itself good enoug h for the best education , and looks to somethin g more modest .
Thus, even after the Repea l of the Corn Laws , it appeare d a matter of course that the men who had carried th e day, the Cobdens , Brights , Forsters, etc.
, shoul d remain exclude d from a share in the official governmen t of the country, unti l twenty years afterwards , a new Refor m Act 2 1 opened t o them the door of the Cabinet .
The English bourgeoisi e are, up to the presen t day, so deeply penetrate d by a sense of their socia l inferiorit y that they keep up, at their own expens e and that of the nation , an ornamenta l caste of drones to represen t the nation worthil y at all state functions ; and they conside r themselve s * And even in busines s matters , the concei t of nationa l chauvinis m is but a sorry adviser .
Up to quite recently , the averag e English manufacture r considere d it derogatory fro m an Englishma n to speak any languag e but his own, and felt rather proud tha n otherwis e of the fact that "poor devils" of foreigner s settled in Englan d and took off his hands the trouble of disposin g of his product s abroad .
He never noticed tha t these foreigners , mostly Germans , thus got comman d of a very large part of British foreign trade, imports and exports , and that the direct foreign trade of Englishme n becam e limited , almost entirely , to the colonies , China, the United States, an d South America .
Nor did he notice that these German s traded with other Germans abroad , who graduall y organise d a complet e networ k of commercia l colonies al l over the world.
But when Germany , about forty years ago, seriousl y began manufacturin g for export , this networ k served her admirabl y in her transformation i n so short a time, from a corn-exportin g into a first-rat e manufacturing country .
Then, about ten years ago, the British manufacture r got frightened, an d asked his ambassador s and consul s how it was that he could no longer kee p his customer s together .
The unanimou s answe r was: (1) You don't learn you r customer' s languag e but expect him to speak your own; (2) You don't even try to suit your customer' s wants, habits, and tastes, but expect him to conform t o your English ones.
highly honoure d wheneve r one of themselve s is found worthy of admission int o this select and privilege d body, manufactured , after all, by themselves .
The industria l and commercia l middle class had, therefore , not yet succeede d in drivin g the landed aristocrac y completel y from political powe r when anothe r competitor , the workin g class, appeared o n the stage.
The reactio n after the Chartis t movemen t and the continenta l revolutions , as well as the unparallele d extension o f English trade from 1848 to 1866 (ascribe d vulgarl y to Free Trad e alone, but due far more to the colossa l developmen t of railways, ocea n steamer s and means of intercours e generally) , had again drive n the workin g class into the dependenc y of the Libera l party, of which they formed , as in pre-Chartis t times, the Radica l wing.
Thei r claims to the franchise , however , graduall y becam e irresistible; whil e the Whig leader s of the Liberal s "funked" , Disraeli showe d his superiorit y by makin g the Tories seize the favorable momen t and introduc e househol d suffrage 3 in the boroughs, alon g with a redistributio n of seats.
Then followe d the ballot; the n in 1884 the extensio n of househol d suffrag e to the counties an d a fresh redistributio n of seats, by which electora l districts wer e to some extent equalised.
272 All these measure s considerably increase d the electora l power of the workin g class, so much so that in at least 150 to 200 constituencie s that class now furnishes th e majorit y of voters.
But parliamentar y governmen t is a capital school for teachin g respec t for tradition ; if the middle class loo k with awe and veneratio n upon what Lord John Manner s playfully calle d "our old nobility" , the mass of the workin g people then looke d up with respec t and deferenc e to what used to be designated a s "their betters" , the middle class.
Indeed , the British workman, som e fifteen years ago, was the model workman , whose respectful regar d for the positio n of his master , and whose self-restraining modest y in claimin g rights for himself , console d our Germa n economist s of the Katheder-Socialis t school 273 for the incurable communisti c and revolutionar y tendencie s of their own working me n at home.
But the Englis h middl e class—goo d men of busines s as they are—saw farthe r than the Germa n professors .
They had shared their powe r but reluctantl y with the workin g class.
They had learnt, durin g the Chartis t years, what that puer robustus sed malitiosus, th e people , is capable of.
And since that time, they had a In Die Neue Zeit there follows : "which was extende d to every lease-holder".
— Ed.
been compelle d to incorporat e the better part of the People' s Charter i n the Statute s of the United Kingdom .
Now, if ever, the people mus t be kept in order by moral means, and the first and foremost o f all moral means of action upon the masses is and remains—religion.
Henc e the parsons ' majoritie s on the school boards, henc e the increasin g self-taxatio n of the bourgeoisi e for the suppor t of all sorts of revivalism, 3 from ritualism 2 4 to the Salvation Army .
And now came the triump h of British respectability 15 over the free though t and religiou s laxity of the continenta l bourgeois .
The workmen o f France and German y had becom e rebellious .
They were thoroughl y infecte d with socialism , and, for very good reasons, wer e not at all particula r as to the legality of the means by which to secure their own ascendency .
The puer robustus, here, turned fro m day to day more malitiosus.
Nothin g remaine d to the French an d Germa n bourgeoisi e as a last resourc e but to silently drop thei r free thought , as a youngster , when sea-sicknes s creeps upon him , quietly drops the burnin g cigar he brough t swaggering -ly on board ; one by one, the scoffer s turned pious in outwar d behaviour, spok e with respec t of the Church , its dogmas and rites, and even conforme d with the latter as far as could not be helped .
French bourgeoi s dined maigre 0 on Fridays, an d Germa n ones sat out long Protestan t sermon s in their pews on Sundays .
They had come to grief with materialism .
"Die Religion muss dem Volk erhalten werden,"—* religion mus t be kept alive for the people—tha t was the only an d the last means to save societ y from utter ruin.
Unfortunately fo r themselves , they did not find this out until they had don e their level best to break up religio n for ever.
And now it was the turn of the British bourgeoi s to sneer and to say: "Why, you fools , I could have told you that two hundre d years ago!" However, I am afraid neithe r the religiou s stolidit y of the British, no r the post festum conversio n of the continenta l bourgeoi s will stem the rising proletaria n tide.
Traditio n is a great retardin g force, is the vis inertiae o f history , but, being merely passive , is sure to be broke n down ; and thus religio n will be no lasting safeguard t o capitalis t society .
If our juridical , philosophical , and religious idea s are the more or less remot e offshoot s of the economical relation s prevailin g in a given society , such ideas a Die Neue Zeit has "for the use of all possibl e means of pious demagogy " instead o f "for the suppor t of all sorts of revivalism".
— Ed b Die Neue Zeit has "Britis h respectabl e philistinism " instea d of "Britis h respectability".
— Ed c Withou t meat or milk.
— Ed cannot, i n the long run, withstan d the effects of a complet e change i n these relations .
And, unless we believe in supernatura l revelation, w e must admit that no religiou s tenets will ever suffice to prop up a totterin g society .
In fact, in Englan d too, the workin g people have begun to move again.
The y are, no doubt, shackle d by tradition s of various kinds.
Bourgeois traditions , such as the widesprea d belief that there can be but two parties , Conservative s and Liberals , and that the working clas s must work out its salvatio n by and throug h the great Liberal Party .
Workin g men's traditions , inherite d from their first tentative effort s at independen t action, such as the exclusion , from ever so many old Trade Unions , of all applicant s who have not gone throug h a regular apprenticeship ; which means the breedin g by every such union , of its own blacklegs .
But for all that the English workin g class is moving , as even Professo r Brentano has sorrowfully ha d to report to his brothe r Katheder-Socialists.
3 It moves, lik e all things in England , with a slow and measure d step, with hesitatio n here, with more or less unfruitful , tentativ e attempts there ; it moves now and then with an over-cautiou s mistrust o f the name of Socialism , while it graduall y absorb s the substance; an d the movemen t spread s and seizes one layer of the workers afte r another .
It has now shake n out of their torpor the unskilled labourer s of the East End of London , and we all know what a splendid impuls e these fresh forces have given it in return .
And if the pace of the movemen t is not up to the impatienc e of some people , let them not forget that it is the workin g class which keeps aliv e the finest qualitie s of the English character , and that, if a step in advanc e is once gained in England , it is, as a rule, never lost afterwards .
If the sons of the old Chartists , for reason s explained above , were not quite up to the mark, the grandson s bid fair to be worthy of their forefathers .
But the triump h of the Europea n workin g class does not depend upo n Englan d alone .
It can only be secure d by the co-operation of , at least, England , France , and Germany .
In both the latte r countrie s the working-clas s movemen t is well ahead of England.
I n German y it is even within measurabl e distanc e of success.
Th e progres s it has there made during the last twenty-fiv e years is unparalleled .
It advance s with ever-increasin g velocity .
If the Germa n middl e class have shown themselve s lamentabl y deficient i n politica l capacity , discipline , courage , energy , and a This refers to L.

CARL SCHORLEMME R Not onl y scienc e in all countries , but also Germa n Social Democracy, mour n at the grave earthe d in today at the Souther n Municipal Cemetefr y in Manchester .
The great chemis t who lies there wa s a Communis t before Lassalle appeared i n Germany ; far from makin g any secret of his conviction s he was, until his death, an active and regula r dues-payin g membe r of the Socialis t Party of Germany.
Carl Schorlemme r was born on Septembe r 30, 1834 in Darm-stadt, attende d gymnasiu m in his home town, and then studie d chemistry i n Giesse n and Heidelberg .
After completin g his studies he move d in 1858 to England , where at that time more than one career opene d up for talente d chemist s from the Liebig school .
Most of his young colleague s plunge d into industry , but he remained tru e to science , first becomin g the assistan t of Angus Smith, th e private chemist , and then of Roscoe , who shortly before had been appointe d professo r of chemistr y of the newly founde d Owens College.
277 In 1861, having previousl y been Roscoe' s assistant , he was engage d as an official laborator y assistan t at Owens College .
The sixtie s were the time of his remarkabl e chemica l discoveries.
Organi c chemistr y had finally reache d the point at which it could develop , from a large numbe r of isolated , more or less incomplet e statement s about the compositio n of organi c substances, int o a real science .
Schorlemme r selecte d the simples t of these substance s as his object of investigation , convince d that the foundatio n of the new scienc e was to be laid here: substance s originally consistin g only of carbon and hydroge n which becom e the most manifol d and most varied other substance s when part of their hydroge n is replace d by other simple or comple x substances ; these are the paraffins , the best known of which are to be found in petroleum , and from which are derive d alcohols , fatty acids, ether, etc .
We owe our knowledg e about these paraffin s today mainly t o Schorlemmer .
He investigate d the existin g substance s belonging t o the paraffi n series , separate d each one from the others, an d produce d many of them for the first time in pure form; others , which should have existed theoreticall y but were not yet know n in practice , he discovere d and also produced .
Thus he became on e of the founder s of the scientifi c organi c chemistr y of today.
Apart fro m this specialit y of his, however , he also devote d a great dea l of attentio n to what is called theoretica l chemistry , i.
e.
to the basic laws of this science , and the way it fits in with related sciences, tha t is to say physics and physiology .
He was particularl y capable i n this field.
He was probabl y the only importan t scientis t of his time who did not disdain learnin g from Hegel , at that period despise d by many, but esteeme d by himself.
And rightly so.
Anybody wh o wants to achiev e anythin g in the field of theoretica l integrated scienc e must regard natura l phenomen a not as invari-able magnitudes , as most do, but as variabl e and in a state of flux.
And this may be most easily learned , even today, from Hegel .
When I got to know Schorlemme r at the beginnin g of the sixties—within a short time Marx and I becam e intimatel y acquainted wit h him—h e often visited me with a bruised and battered face .
The paraffin s are no playthings , these often still unknown bodie s explode d in his hands all the time, and he thus acquired a number of honourabl e injuries .
It was only due to his glasses tha t he did not lose his sight.
At that time he was already a complet e Communist , and all he had to learn from us were the economi c ground s for a convictio n he had gained long ago.
Once he became familia r throug h us with the progres s made by the workers ' movemen t in the variou s countries, h e always followe d these events with great interest ; but in particula r the movemen t in Germany , after it advance d beyon d the first stage of pure Lassalleanism .
After I moved to Londo n at the end of 1870, the greater part of our lively correspondenc e was concerned wit h the science s and party affairs .
To that date Schorlemmer , despite his world-wid e reputation , had remaine d in Manchester , a man of very modes t status.
This now changed .
In 1871 he was propose d as a member of the ROYAL SOCIETY, th e English Academ y of Sciences , and immediatel y elected , which doe s not often happen ; in 1874 Owen s Colleg e finally established a new professorshi p in organi c chemistry , speciall y for him, an d soon after the Universit y of Glasgo w made him an honorary doctor .
But these public honour s made absolutel y no difference t o him.
He was the soul of modesty , since his modest y was base d upon a correct assessmen t of his own worth.
For this reason h e regarde d these honour s as self-evident , and therefor e immaterial.
He regularl y spent his holiday s in Londo n with Marx and myself, except for the time he spent in Germany .
Four years ago he accompanie d me on a "whirlwin d trip" to America.
278 But his health wa s undermine d even then; in 1890 we were still able to travel to Norwa y and the North Cape, but in 1891 his health collapsed a t the beginnin g of a joint journey we attempted, 2 9 and after thi s he never came to Londo n again.
From Februar y this year he was almost entirely confine d to the house, and from May to his bed; on June 27 he succumbe d to cancer of the lung.
It was the lot even of this man of science to experienc e in person th e effects of the Anti-Socialis t Law.
280 Six or seven years ago he travelle d from Switzerlan d to Darmstadt .
Around this time a trunk full of the Sozialdemokrat from Zuric h had fallen into the hands of the police somewhere .
Who could the smuggle r be other than the Social Democrati c professor ? After all, in the eyes of the police a chemist is a scientificall y trained smuggler .
So there were raids on the homes of his mothe r and his brother ; but the professor wa s in Höchst.
Immediate telegrams : a domicilar y search there too , in which somethin g quite unexpecte d was found — an English passport .
After the promulgatio n of the Anti-Socialis t Law Schorlemme r had had himsel f naturalise d in England .
This English passpor t stoppe d the police in their tracks; they shied away fro m diplomati c complication s with England .
So the upsho t was a big scanda l in Darmstadt , which was worth at least 500 votes to us at the next election .
In the name of the Party Executiv e I laid upon the grave of our true frien d and comrad e a wreath with a red streame r inscribed : "FROM TH E EXECUTIV E OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATI C PARTY OF GERMANY" .
London, Jul y 1, 1892 Frederick Engels First publishe d in the Vorwärts, No.
153 , Printe d accordin g to the news-July 3, 1892 (supplement ) pape r Published i n Englis h for the first time [PREFACE TO THE SECON D GERMA N EDITIO N (1892 ) OF THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING-CLASS IN ENGLAND]281 The boo k herewit h again made availabl e to the Germa n public first appeare d in the summe r of 1845.
Both in its strength s and in its weaknesse s it bears the stamp of the author' s youth.
At the time, I was twenty-four ; today, I am thrice as old, and as I reread this early work I find I need not be ashame d of it on any count.
So I have no intentio n of someho w obliteratin g this stamp of youthfulness.
I am presentin g my work to the reader again, unchanged.
I have only worde d more precisel y a few not entirely clear passage s and added , here and there, a brief footnote , marked wit h the presen t date (1892).
As for the fate of this book, I will only mentio n that an Englis h translation o f it (by Mrs.
Florenc e Kelley-Wischnewetzky ) came out in New York in 1887 and was also publishe d by Swan Son-nenschein & Co.
in Londo n in 1892.
The preface to the America n edition 282 underlie s that to the English one, 3 and the latter in its turn underlie s the presen t Germa n preface .
Moder n large-scal e industry make s the economi c condition s in all the countrie s affected unifor m to such an enormou s extent that I hardly need tell the Germa n reade r anythin g differen t from what I tell the American o r English .
The stat e of things describe d in this book belong s today in many respects, t o the past, as far as Englan d is concerned .
Thoug h not expressly state d in our recognise d treatises , it is still a law of modern politica l econom y that the larger the scale on which capitalistic productio n is carried on, the less can it support the petty device s of swindlin g and pilferin g which characteris e its early a See this volume , pp.

stages.
Th e pettifoggin g busines s tricks of the Polish Jew, the representative i n Europ e of commerc e in its lowest stage, those tricks tha t serve him so well in his own country , and are generall y practised there , fail him once he comes to Hambur g or Berlin ; and, again , the commissio n agent who hails from Berli n or Hamburg, Je w or Christian , after frequentin g the Mancheste r Exchange, find s out that in order to buy cotton yarn or cloth cheap, he , too, had better drop those slightly more refined but still miserable wile s and subterfuge s which are considere d the acme of cleverness i n his native country .
Of course , with the progres s of large-scale industr y a great deal has supposedl y change d in Germany too , and a bad odour now attaches , particularl y since the industrial Jen a of Philadelphia, 283 even to the time-honoure d German principle : People will be nothin g but pleased if we first send the m good sample s and then bad goods.
The fact is, those tricks do not pay any longer in a large market , where time is money, an d where a certain standar d of commercia l moralit y is unavoidably develope d not because of any consideration s of virtue, but purel y as a means of saving time and trouble .
And exactly the same ha s taken place in Englan d with the relatio n betwee n the manufacturer an d his "hands" .
The reviva l of trade, after the crisis of 1847, was the dawn of a new industria l epoch.
The repeal of the Corn Laws 284 and the financial reform s subsequen t thereon gave to English industr y and commerce al l the elbow-roo m they had asked for.

And, finally , the new means of communicatio n introduce d at the close of the precedin g period — railways and ocean steamers — were no w worke d out on an internationa l scale; they realise d actually wha t had hithert o existed only potentially , a world-market.

PATERNOSTER SQUARE 1892 Title pag e of the English edition of The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 22-1550 Reverse o f the title page of The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 presented b y Engels to Eleano r Marx-Avelin g with the greate r part of their requirement s in manufacture d articles.
N o wonder , therefore , that England' s industria l progres s was colossa l and unparallelled , and such that the status of 1844 now appear s to us as comparativel y insignificant , almost primitive .
And in proportio n as this increas e took place, in the same proportion di d manufacturin g industr y becom e apparentl y moral-ised.
Th e competitio n of manufacture r agains t manufacture r by means o f petty thefts upon the workpeopl e did no longer pay.
Trade ha d outgrow n such low mean s of makin g money ; the manufacturing millionair e had to know better than waste his time on petty tricks of this kind.
Such practice s were good enough , at best, for small fry in need of money , who had to snap up every penny in order not to succum b to competition .
Thus the TRUCK SYSTEM wa s suppressed , the Ten-Hours ' Bill285 was enacted , and a number o f other secondar y reform s introduce d — much agains t the spiri t of Free Trade and unbridle d competition , but quite as much in favour of the giant-capitalis t in his competitio n with his less favoure d brother .
Moreover, th e larger the concern , and with it the numbe r of workers, th e greate r the loss and inconvenienc e caused by every conflict wit h the worker s and thus a new spirit came over the manufacturers, especiall y the largest ones, which taught them to avoid unnecessar y squabbles , to acquiesc e in the existenc e and power of TRADE S UNIONS , and finally even to discove r in strikes—a t opportune times— a powerfu l means to serve their own ends.
The largest manufacturers , formerl y the leaders of the war against the working class , were now the foremos t to preac h peace and harmony.
An d for a very good reason .
All these concession s to justice and philanthrop y were nothin g else but means to accelerat e the concentratio n of capital in the hands of the few and crushin g the smaller competitors , who could not surviv e withou t extra receipt s of this sort.
To these few, the petty accessor y extortion s of earlier years had not only lost all significance bu t had turned , as it were, into hindrance s to large-scale business .
Thus the developmen t of productio n on the basis of the capitalisti c system has of itself sufficed—a t least in the leading industries , for in the more unimportan t branche s this is far from being the case—t o do away with all those minor grievances whic h aggravate d the workman' s fate during its earlier years.
And thus it renders more and more eviden t the great central fac t that the cause of the miserabl e conditio n of the working clas s is to be sought , not in these minor grievances , but in the capitalistic system itself.
The worke r sells to the capitalis t his 22* labour-force fo r a certain daily sum.
After a few hours ' work he has reproduce d the value of that sum; but the substanc e of his contract is , that he has to work anothe r series of hours to complet e his working-day ; and the value he produce s durin g these additional hour s of surplus labour is surplus value, which costs the capitalist nothing , but yet goes into his pocket .
That is the basis of the syste m which tends more and more to split up civilise d society into a few Rothschild s and Vanderbilts , the owner s of all the means o f productio n and subsistence , on the one hand, and an immense numbe r of wage-workers , the owner s of nothin g but their labour-force , on the other.
And that this result is caused, not by this or that secondar y grievance , but by the system itself—thi s fact has been brough t out in bold relief by the developmen t of capitalism i n England .
Again, th e repeate d visitation s of cholera , typhus, smallpox , and other epidemic s have shown the British bourgeoi s the urgen t necessity o f sanitatio n in his towns and cities, if he wishes to save himself an d family from falling victim s to such diseases .
Accord -ingly, th e most crying abuses describe d in this book have either disappeared o r have been made less conspicuous .
Drainag e has been introduce d or improved , wide avenue s have been opened out athwart man y of the worst "slums" .
"Little Ireland " had disappeared, an d the "SEVE N DIALS " 286 are next on the list for sweeping away .
But what of that? Whole district s which in 1844 I could describ e as almost idyllic have now, with the growth of the towns, falle n into the same state of dilapidation , discomfort , and misery.
Onl y the pigs and the heaps of refuse are no longe r tolerated.
Th e bourgeoisi e have made furthe r progres s in the art of hidin g the distres s of the workin g class.
But that, in regard to their dwellings , no substantia l improvemen t has taken place is amply prove d by the Repor t of the Royal Commissio n "ON THE HOUSING O F THE POOR" , 1885.
a And this is the case, too, in other respects.
Polic e regulation s have been plentifu l as blackberries ; but they can only hedge in the distres s of the workers , they canno t remove it .
But whil e Englan d has thus outgrow n the juvenil e state of capitalist exploitatio n describe d by me, other countrie s have only just attaine d it.
France , Germany , and especiall y America , are the formidable competitor s who, at this moment—a s foresee n by me a See Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes.

in 1844—ar e more and more breakin g up England' s industria l monopoly.
Thei r manufacture s are young as compare d with those of England , but increasin g at a far more rapid rate than the latter; and they have at this momen t arrived at about the same phase of development a s Englis h manufactur e in 1844.
With regard to America, th e paralle l is indeed most striking .
True, the externa l surroundings i n which the workin g class is placed in Americ a are very different , but the same economica l laws are at work, and the results, i f not identica l in every respect , must still be of the same order.
Henc e we find in Americ a the same struggle s for a shorter working-day, fo r a legal limitatio n of the working-time , especiall y of wome n and childre n in factories ; we find the TRUCKSYSTEM i n full blossom, an d the COTTAG E SYSTEM, 287 in rural districts , made use of by the "BOSSES" , the capitalist s and their agents , as a means of domination ove r the workers .
When I received , in 1886, the American paper s with account s of the great strike of 12,000 Pennsylvanian coal-miner s in the Connellsvill e district, 288 I seemed but to read my own descriptio n of the North of Englan d colliers ' strike of 1844.
a The same cheatin g of the workpeopl e by false measure; th e same TRUCK SYSTEM ; the same attemp t to break the miners' resistanc e by the capitalists ' last, but crushing , resource — the evictio n of the men out of their dwellings , the cottage s owned by the companies .
Neither her e nor in the English edition s did I try to update the book, i.
e .
to list one by one the change s that have taken place since 1844.
I did not do it for two reasons .
Firstly, I would have had to double th e volum e of the book.
And secondly , Volum e One of Marx's Capital give s a detailed descriptio n of the conditio n of the British workin g class for about 1865, i.
e.
the time when Britain' s industrial prosperit y had reache d its peak.
I would therefor e have had to repeat what Marx says.
It will be hardly necessar y to point out that the genera l theoretical standpoin t of this book—philosophical , economical , political—does no t exactly coincid e with my standpoin t of to-day.
Modern internationa l socialism , since fully develope d as a science, chiefly an d almost exclusivel y throug h the efforts of Marx, did not as yet exist in 1844.
My book represent s one of the phases of its embryonic development ; and as the human embryo , in its early stages, stil l reproduce s the gill-arche s of our fish-ancestors , so this book exhibit s everywher e the traces of the descen t of moder n a See presen t edition , Vol.

— Ed socialism fro m one of its ancestors , Germa n classica l philosophy .
Thus grea t stress is laid on the dictum that communis m is not a mere part y doctrin e of the workin g class, but a theory compassin g the emancipatio n of society at large, includin g the capitalis t class, from its presen t narrow conditions .
This is true enoug h in the abstract, bu t absolutel y useless , and sometime s worse, in practice .
So long as the wealth y classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation, bu t strenuousl y oppose the self-emancipatio n of the working class , so long the social revolutio n will have to be prepared an d fought out by the workin g class alone.
The French bourgeois o f l789, a too, declare d the emancipatio n of the bourgeoisie t o be the emancipatio n of the whole human race; but the nobilit y and clergy would not see it; the proposition—thoug h for the time being, with respec t to feudalism , an abstrac t historica l truth — soon becam e a mere sentimentalism , and disappeare d from vie w altogethe r in the fire of the revolutionar y struggle .
And to-day, th e very peopl e who, from the "impartiality " of their superior standpoint , preach to the worker s a socialis m soarin g high abov e their class interest s and class struggles—thes e people are eithe r neophytes , who have still to learn a great deal, or they are the worst enemie s of the workers—wolve s in sheep's clothing .
The recurrin g period of the great industria l crisis is stated in the text as five years.
This was the period apparentl y indicate d by the cours e of events from 1825 to 1842.
But the industria l history from 184 2 to 1868 has shown that the real period is one of ten years; that the intermediat e revulsion s were secondary , and had been increasingl y disappearin g from 1842 onwards .
Since 1868 the state of things has change d again, of which more anon.
I have taken care not to strike out of the text the many prophecies, amongs t others that of an imminen t social revolutio n in England , which my youthfu l ardou r induce d me to ventur e upon.
Th e wonde r is, not that a good many of these prophecie s proved wrong , but that so many of them have proved right, and that the critica l state of Englis h trade, to be brough t on by Continental an d especiall y America n competition , which I then foresaw—though i n too short a period—ha s now actuall y come to pass.
In this respect I am bound to bring the book up to date, by placing her e an article which appeare d in the Londo n Commonweal a Engels refers to the French Revolution.

of March 1, 1885, in English and in Neue Zeit i n June of the same year (Issu e 6) in German.
289 "Forty year s ago Englan d stood face to face with a crisis, solvable t o all appearance s by force only.
The immens e and rapid development o f manufacture s had outstrippe d the extensio n of foreign market s and the increas e of demand .
Every ten years the march o f industr y was violentl y interrupte d by a genera l commercial crash , followed , after a long perio d of chroni c depression, b y a few short years of prosperity , and always ending in feveris h over-productio n and consequen t renewe d collapse .
The capitalist clas s clamoure d for Free Trad e in corn, 290 and threatened t o enforc e it by sendin g the starvin g populatio n of the towns bac k to the countr y district s whenc e they came, to invade them, as John Bright said, not as pauper s beggin g for bread, but as an army quartere d upon the enemy.
3 The workin g masses of the town s demande d their share of politica l power—th e People' s Charter291; the y were supporte d by the majorit y of the small trading class , and the only differenc e betwee n the two was whether th e Charte r should be carried by physica l or by moral force.
The n came the commercia l crash of 1847 and the Irish famine, an d with both the prospec t of revolution .
"The Frenc h Revolutio n of 1848 saved the English middle class.
The Socialisti c pronunciamento s of the victoriou s French workme n frightened th e small middle class of Englan d and disorganise d the narrower, bu t more matter-of-fac t movemen t of the Englis h working class .
At the very momen t when Chartis m was bound to assert itsel f in its full strength , it collapse d internall y before even it collapsed externally , on the 10th of April, 1848.
The action of the workin g class was thrust into the background .
The capitalis t class triumphe d along the whole line.
"The Refor m Bill of 1831 293 had been the victory of the whole capitalist clas s over the landed aristocracy .
The repeal of the Corn Laws wa s the victory of the manufacturing capitalis t not only over the lande d aristocracy , but over those section s of capitalists , too, whose interest s were more or less bound up with the landed interest—bankers, stockjobbers , fundholders , etc.
Free Trade meant th e readjustmen t of the whole home and foreign , commercial an d financia l policy of Englan d in accordanc e with the interests o f the manufacturin g capitalists—th e class which now a These words belong apparentl y not to Bright but to his adherents .

represented th e nation .
And they set about this task with a will.
Every obstacl e to industria l productio n was mercilessl y removed .
The tarif f and the whole system of taxatio n were revolutionised .
Everything wa s made subordinat e to one end, but that end of the utmost importanc e to the manufacturin g capitalist : the cheapenin g of all raw produce , and especiall y of the means of living of the working class ; the reductio n of the cost of raw material , and the keeping down—i f not as yet the bringin g down—o f wages .
England wa s to becom e the 'worksho p of the world' 294; all other countries wer e to becom e for Englan d what Irelan d alread y was—markets fo r her manufacture d goods , supplyin g her in return wit h raw material s and food.
England , the great manufac -turing centr e of an agricultura l world, with an ever-increasin g number o f corn and cotton-growin g Ireland s revolvin g aroun d her, the industria l sun.
What a glorious prospect ! "The manufacturin g capitalist s set about the realisatio n of this their grea t object with that strong commo n sense and that contempt fo r traditiona l principle s which has ever distinguishe d them fro m their more narrow-minde d compeer s on the Continent .
Chartism wa s dying out.
The reviva l of commercia l prosperity , natural afte r the revulsio n of 1847 had spent itself, was put down altogether t o the credit of Free Trade .
Both these circumstance s had turne d the Englis h workin g class, politically , into the tail of the 'grea t Liberal Party', the party led by the manufacturers .
This advantage, onc e gained , had to be perpetuated .
And the manufacturing capitalists , from the Chartis t opposition , not to Free Trade , but to the transformatio n of Free Trade into the one vital nationa l question , had learnt , and were learnin g more and more, tha t the middl e class can never obtain full social and political powe r over the nation except by the help of the workin g class.
Thus a gradual change came over the relation s betwee n both classes.
Th e Factor y Acts, 2 5 once the bugbea r of all manufactur -ers, were not only willingl y submitte d to, but their expansio n into acts regulatin g almos t all trades was tolerated .
Trades Unions , hitherto considere d invention s of the devil himself , were now petted an d patronise d as perfectl y legitimat e institutions , and as useful mean s of spreadin g sound economica l doctrine s amongs t the workers.
Eve n strikes , than which nothin g had been more nefari-ous up to 1848, were now graduall y found out to be occasionall y very useful , especiall y when provoke d by the master s themselves , at their own time.
Of the legal enactments , placing the workma n at a lower level or at a disadvantag e with regard to the master , at least the most revoltin g were repealed .
And, practically , that horrid People' s Charte r actuall y becam e the politica l programm e of the very manufacturer s who had oppose d it to the last.
The Abolition of the Property Qualification an d Vote by Ballot ar e now the law of the land.
The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 296 make a near approac h to universal suffrage, a t least such as it now exists in Germany; th e Redistributio n Bill now before Parliamen t creates equal electoral districts—on th e whole not more unequa l than those of Franc e or Germany ; payment of members, an d shorter , if not actually annual Parliaments, ar e visibly loomin g in the distance — and yet there are people who say that Chartis m is dead.
"The Revolutio n of 1848, not less than many of its predecessors , has had strang e bedfellow s and successors .
The very people who put it down have become , as Karl Marx used to say, its testamentary executors.
297 Loui s Napoleo n had to create an independent an d united Italy, Bismarc k had to revolutionis e Germany an d to restor e Hungaria n independence , and the English manufacturer s had to enact the People' s Charter .
"For England , the effects of this dominatio n of the manufactur -ing capitalist s were at first startling .
Trade revive d and extende d to a degree unhear d of even in this cradle of moder n industry ; the previou s astoundin g creation s of steam and machiner y dwindled int o nothin g compare d with the immens e mass of productions o f the twenty years from 1850 to 1870, with the overwhelming figure s of export s and imports , of wealth accumu -lated in the hands of capitalist s and of human workin g power concentrated i n the large towns .
The progres s was indee d interrupted, a s before, by a crisis every ten years, in 1857 as well as in 1866 ; but these revulsion s were now considere d as natural , inevitable events , which must be fatalisticall y submitte d to, and which alway s set themselve s right in the end.
"And th e conditio n of the working-clas s during this period ? There wa s temporar y improvemen t even for the great mass.
But this improvemen t always was reduce d to the old level by the influx of the great body of the unemploye d reserve , by the constan t superseding o f hands by new machinery , by the immigratio n of the agricultura l population , now, too, more and more supersede d by machines .
"A permanen t improvemen t can be recognise d for two 'pro-tected' section s only of the workin g class.
Firstly, the factor y hands.
The fixing by Act of Parliamen t of their working-da y within relativel y rationa l limits has restore d their physica l constitu -tion and endowe d them with a moral superiority , enhance d by their loca l concentration .
They are undoubtedl y better off than before 1848 .
The best proof is that, out of ten strikes they make, nine are provoke d by the manufacturer s in their own interests , as the only means of securin g a reduced production .
You can never get the master s to agree to work 'short time', let manufacture d goods be ever so unsaleable ; but get the workpeopl e to strike, and the master s shut their factorie s to a man.
"Secondly, th e great Trades Unions .
They are the organisation s of those trades in which the labour of grown-up men predominates , or is alone applicable .
Here the competitio n neithe r of women and children no r of machiner y has so far weakene d their organise d strength.
Th e engineers , the carpenter s and joiners , the brick-layers, ar e each of them a power, to that extent that, as in the case of the bricklayer s and bricklayers ' labourers , they can even successfully resis t the introductio n of machinery .
That their condition ha s remarkabl y improve d since 1848 there can be no doubt, an d the best proof of this is in the fact that for more than fifteen year s not only have their employer s been with them, but they wit h their employers , upon exceedingl y good terms.
They form a n aristocrac y amon g the workin g class; they have succeeded i n enforcin g for themselve s a relativel y comfortabl e position, an d they accept it as final.
They are the model workin g men of Messrs .
Leone Levi 8c Giffe n (and also the worthy Lujo Brentano), and they are very nice people indeed nowaday s to deal with, for any sensibl e capitalis t in particula r and for the whole capitalist clas s in general .
"But as to the great mass of workin g people , the state of misery and insecurit y in which they live now is as low as ever, if not lower.
Th e East End of Londo n is an everspreadin g pool of stagnant miser y and desolation , of starvatio n when out of work, and degradation , physica l and moral, when in work.
And so in all other larg e towns—abstractio n made of the privilege d minorit y of the workers ; and so in the smalle r towns and in the agricultura l districts.
Th e law which reduce s the value of labour-powe r to the value of the necessar y means of subsistence , and the other law which reduce s its averag e price, as a rule, to the minimu m of those mean s of subsistence , these laws act upon them with the irresistible forc e of an automati c engin e which crushe s them between it s wheels .
"This, then was the positio n created by the Free Trade policy of 1847, and by twenty years of the rule of the manufacturin g capitalists.
Bu t then a change came.
The crash of 1866 was, indeed, followe d by a slight and short revival about 1873; but that did not last.
We did not, indeed , pass throug h the full crisis at the time it was due, in 1877 or 1878; but we have had, ever since 1876, a chronic state of stagnatio n in all dominan t branche s of industry.
Neithe r will the full crash come; nor will the period of longed-for prosperit y to which we used to be entitle d before and after it.
A dull depression , a chronic glut of all market s for all trades, tha t is what we have been living in for nearly ten years.
How is this? "The Fre e Trade theory was based upon one assumption : that England wa s to be the one great manufacturin g centre of an agricultural world .
And the actual fact is that this assumptio n has turned ou t to be a pure delusion .
The condition s of moder n industry, steam-powe r and machinery , can be establishe d whereve r there is fuel, especiall y coals.
And other countrie s beside s England—France, Belgium , Germany , America , even Russia — have coals .
And the people over there did not see the advantag e of being turned into Irish paupe r farmer s merely for the greate r wealth an d glory of English capitalists .
They set resolutel y about manufacturing, no t only for themselves , but for the rest of the world; an d the consequenc e is that the manufacturin g monopol y enjoyed b y Englan d for nearly a century is irretrievabl y broke n UP-"But the manufacturin g monopol y of Englan d is the pivot of the presen t social system of England .
Even while that monopol y lasted, th e market s could not keep pace with the increasin g productivity o f Englis h manufacturers ; the decennia l crises were the consequence .
And new market s are getting scarcer every day, so much so that even the Negroe s of the Congo are now to be forced int o the civilisatio n attendan t upon Mancheste r calicos , Staffordshire pottery , and Birmingha m hardware .
How will it be when Continental , and especiall y American , goods flow in in ever-increasing quantities—whe n the predominatin g share, still held by British manufacturers , will become reduce d from year to year? Answer , Free Trade , thou universa l panacea .
"I am not the first to point this out.
Alread y in 1883, at the Southport meetin g of the British Association, 2 8 Mr.
Inglis Pal-grave, th e Presiden t of the Economi c section , stated plainly that " 'the days of great trade profits in Englan d were over, and there was a pause in the progres s of several great branche s of industria l labour.
The country might almost be said to be entering the non-progressive state'.
* "But wha t is to be the consequence ? Capitalis t productio n cannot stop.
It must go on increasin g and expanding , or it must die.

now the mere reductio n of England' s lion's share in the supply of the world' s market s means stagnation , distress , excess of capital here, excess of unemploye d workpeopl e there.
What will it be when th e increas e of yearly productio n is brough t to a complet e stop? "Here i s the vulnerabl e place , the heel of Achilles , for capitalistic production .
Its very basis is the necessit y of constan t expansion, an d this constan t expansio n now become s impossible .
It ends in a deadlock .
Every year Englan d is brough t nearer face to face with the question : either the countr y must go to pieces , or capitalist productio n must.
Which is it to be? "And th e workin g class? If even under the unparallele d commercial an d industria l expansion , from 1848 to 1868, they have had to underg o such misery ; if even then the great bulk of them experience d at best but a temporar y improvemen t of their condition, whil e only a small, privileged , 'protected ' minorit y was permanently benefited , what will it be when this dazzlin g period is brought finall y to a close; when the presen t dreary stagnatio n shall not only becom e intensified , but this, its intensifie d condition , shall become th e permanen t and norma l state of English trade? "The trut h is this: during the period of England' s industria l monopoly th e Englis h workin g class have, to a certain extent , shared i n the benefit s of the monopoly .
These benefit s were very unequally parcelle d out amongs t them; the privilege d minorit y pocketed most , but even the great mass had, at least, a temporar y share no w and then.
And that is the reason why, since the dying-out o f Owenism , there has been no Socialis m in England .
With the breakdow n of that monopoly , the English workin g class will lose that privilege d position ; it will find itself generally—th e privileged an d leadin g minorit y not excepted—o n a level with its fellow-workers abroad .
And that is the reason why there will be Socialism agai n in England.
" So I wrote in 1885.
In the Preface to the English edition written on Januar y 11, 1892 I continued : "To this statemen t of the case, as that case appeare d to me in 1885, I have but little to add.
Needles s to say that to-day there is indeed 'Socialism agai n in England' , and plenty of it—Socialis m of all shades: Socialis m consciou s and unconscious , Socialis m prosai c and poetic, Socialis m of the workin g class and of the middle class, for, verily, tha t abominatio n of abominations , Socialism , has not only become respectable , but has actuall y donne d evenin g dress and lounges lazil y on drawing-roo m causeuses.
That show s the incurabl e fickleness o f that terrible despot of 'society' , middle-clas s public opinion, an d once more justifie s the contemp t in which we Socialist s of a past generatio n always held that public opinion .
At the same time we have no reason to grumbl e at the sympto m itself.
"What I conside r far more importan t than this momentar y fashion amon g bourgeoi s circles of affectin g a mild dilutio n of Socialism, an d even more than the actual progres s Socialis m has made in Englan d generally , that is the revival of the East End of London.
Tha t immens e haunt of misery is no longer the stagnan t pool it was six years ago.
It has shaken off its torpid despair , has returned t o life, and has becom e the home of what is called the 'New Unionism' , that is to say, of the organisatio n of the great mass of 'unskilled ' workers .
This organisatio n may to a great extent adop t the form of the old Union s of 'skilled ' worker s but it is essentiall y differen t in character .
The old Unions preserv e the traditions o f the time when they were founded , and look upon the wages syste m as a once-for-al l established , final fact, which they at best can modify in the interes t of their members .
The new Union s were founde d at a time when the faith in the eternit y of the wages system wa s severel y shaken ; their founder s and promoter s were Socialists eithe r consciousl y or by feeling ; the masses , whose adhesion gav e them strength , were rough, neglected , looked down upon by the working-clas s aristocracy ; but they had this immens e advantage, tha t their minds were virgin soil, entirel y free from the inherited 'respectable ' bourgeoi s prejudice s which hampere d the brains of the better situate d 'old' Unionists .
And thus we see now these ne w Union s taking the lead of the working-clas s movemen t generally, an d more and more taking in tow the rich and proud 'old' Unions .
"Undoubtedly, th e East Enders have committe d colossa l blun-ders; so have their predecessors , and so do the doctrinair e Socialists wh o pooh-poo h them.
A large class, like a great nation, never learn s better or quicke r than by undergoin g the consequ -ences of its own mistakes .
And for all the faults committe d in past, present an d future, the revival of the East End of Londo n remain s one of the greates t and most fruitful facts of this fin de siècle, and glad and prou d I am to have lived to see it.
" Since I wrote the above , six month s ago, the Englis h working-class movemen t has again made a good step forward .
The parliamentary election s which took place a few days ago gave both the officia l parties , Conservativ e as well as Liberal , notice in due form tha t from now on one and the other will have to reckon with a third party, the workers ' party.
This workers ' party is now only in the proces s of formation ; its element s are still engage d in shaking of f traditiona l prejudice s of all kinds—bourgeois , old trade-unionist, indeed , even doctrinaire-socialist—i n order to be able to get togethe r at last on ground commo n to all of them.
And yet the instinc t to unite which they followe d was already so strong that it produce d electio n results hithert o unheard-o f in England .
In Londo n two workers 3 have stood for election , and openly as Socialists a t that; the Liberal s did not dare to put up one of theirs against them , and the two Socialist s have won by an overwhelmin g and unexpecte d majority .
In Middlesbroug h a workers ' candidate 15 has stood agains t a Liberal and a Conservativ e and been elected in the teeth of both; on the other hand, the new workers ' candidate s who allie d themselve s with the Liberal s have been hopelessl y defeated, wit h the exceptio n of a single one.
Among those who so far have been called workers ' representatives , that is, those who are forgive n their quality of worker s becaus e they themselve s would willingl y drown it in the ocean of their liberalism , the most significant representativ e of the old Unionism , Henry Broadhurst , has suffere d a striking defeat becaus e he declare d himsel f agains t the eight-hou r day.
In two Glasgow , one Salford , and several other constituencies, independen t workers ' candidate s stood agains t candidates o f the two old parties ; they were beaten , but so were the Libera l candidates .
Briefly , in a number of large-tow n and industrial constituencie s the worker s have resolutel y severe d all connections wit h the two old parties and thus achieve d direct or indirect successe s such as they had never scored in any electio n so far.
And the joy on this accoun t among the worker s is boundless .
For the first time they have seen and felt what they can do when they mak e use of their electora l rights in the interes t of their class.
The superstitiou s belief in the "great Libera l Party" which had kept a hold on the English worker s for nearly forty years has been destroyed.
The y have seen by strikin g example s that they, the workers, ar e the decisiv e force in Englan d if only they have the will and know their own will; and the 1892 election s have been the beginning o f that knowledg e and that will.
The workers ' move-ment on the Continen t will see to the rest: the German s and the French, wh o are alread y so strongl y represente d in parliament s and loca l councils , will keep the spirit of emulatio n of the English sufficiently hig h by furthe r successes .
And if in the not very distant futur e it turns out that this new parliamen t can get a James Keir Hardie and Joh n Burns.

„• ° hrs t time [ON CERTAI N PECULIARITIE S IN ENGLAND' S ECONOMI C AND POLITICA L DEVELOPMENT ] Owing to its eternal compromises , the kind of gradual , peacefu l political developmen t that takes place in Englan d gives rise to a situation ful l of contradictions ; becaus e of its overwhelmin g advantages thi s situatio n can be practicall y tolerate d within certain limits, but its logica l absurditie s cause much anguis h to the thinking mind .
Hence , the need of all "state-supporting " parties for a theoretica l cloak, a justification , which, naturally , can be provided onl y throug h sophisms , distortions , and enfin by dubiou s tricks.
Thus, a literatur e is being cultivate d in the politica l field that repeat s all the wretche d hypocris y and untruthfulnes s of theological apologetics , and which also transplant s the theologica l intellectual vice s to a mundan e soil.
Thus the soil of the specifi c liberal hypocris y is fertilised , sown and cultivate d by the Conserva -tives themselves .
And thus is theologica l apologetic s offered an argument, produce d by ordinar y minds , which it lacks in other lands.
What of it if the facts related in the gospel and the dogma s preached i n the New Testamen t in genera l contradic t each other? Does tha t make them untrue ? The Englis h Constitutio n contain s many mor e inconsistencie s and constantl y contradict s itself, but continues t o exist and, hence, is true! September 12 , 1892 The absenc e of crises since 1868 is also due to the expansio n of the worl d market , which distribute s the surplu s English , respec-tively European , capital in transpor t investment , etc.

Thi s has made a crisis impossibl e owing to excessiv e speculation i n railways , banking , etc.

But all this proves that a giant crisis i s in the making .

The Zuric h Committe e which , in conformit y with the Brussel s 1891 resolutions , was entruste d with the preparation s for the next congress o f the Internationa l in 1893, sent a letter of invitatio n to the Trad e Union Congress .
Despite the repeate d complaint s of the secretary o f the Gas Union, Comrad e Will Thorne , during three days of the proceedings , this letter was neither produce d nor read to the Congress , which as a result never had an opportunit y to express it s opinio n about the Zurich invitation .
Finally, Matki n propose d a motion that the Parliamentar y Committee o f the Trade Union Congress 302 shoul d be entruste d with the convenin g of an internationa l congres s to discuss and pass a resolutio n on an internationa l legal eight-hou r workin g day.
Comrade Parnel l (who went to the Paris congres s of 1889) and Comrade Quelc h replied that two internationa l workers ' congres -ses had alread y been called for 1893, one to meet in Zurich , the other in Chicago 303; that the Zurich provisiona l committe e had invited th e Trade Union Congres s to participat e in the Zurich congress, an d that instead of calling a third congres s the invitatio n to the Zurich congres s should be accepted .
In reply , the representative s of the old conservativ e union s stated tha t the Zurich and Chicag o congresse s had not been convened b y the Englis h Trade Unions ; that the worker s on the Continent wer e badly organise d and weak compare d to the English, an d that it was inappropriat e for the Englis h to make themselves responsibl e for all the WILD THEORIE S of continenta l socialism, etc .
etc.
Only then was the invitatio n of our Zurich Committee rea d out.
In the end the Zurich Committe e was turned down by 189 votes against 97 , and the proposa l to summo n "immediately " an international congres s to discus s and pass a resolutio n on the international lega l eight-hou r workin g day was approved .
These tw o votes constitut e an offenc e directe d agains t the organised an d socialis t proletaria t of the whole Europea n Conti-nent.
Le t us hope that the most advance d sectors of the Englis h proletariat who , while being socialist s at heart, ar e still frightene d of the name an d have been taken in by the old conservatives ; that these mor e intelligen t and bolder element s will be able to make amends fo r the mistak e at the next congress .
Meanwhile i t seems appropriat e that the continenta l worker s saye thei r dignity in the face of the insult containe d in the said resolutions, an d this is why I have informe d our friends in France and German y of the events in Glasgow , hoping that they will agree on what line of action to follow; as the French comrade s will be celebrating thei r Marseille s congress 304 in a few days, they will be able to make a first reply to the Trade Union Congress .
But in my capacit y as ex-secretar y for Spain on the Genera l Council o f the old Internationa l of gloriou s memory , I believe it my duty to communicat e to the Spanis h Nationa l Counci l an event which concern s the Spanis h comrade s no less than those of other countries.

THE AMERICA N PRESIDENTIA L ELECTIO N The ancien t world was dominate d by Fatum, Heimarmene , ines-capable mysteriou s fate.
These were the names given by the Greeks and Roman s to that impalpabl e omnipotenc e which frustrate d all human wil l and effort, which led all human deeds to results quite other tha n those intended , that irresistibl e force which has since then been calle d providence , predestination , etc.
This mysteriou s force has slowl y taken on a more palpabl e form, and for this we may thank the rule of the bourgeoisi e and capital , the first system of class rule which seek s to find clarity about the causes and condition s of its own existence, thu s openin g the door to the recognitio n of the inevitability o f its own imminen t fall.
Fate, providence—tha t we know now—consist s of the economi c condition s under which production an d exchang e take place, and these combin e today in the world market.
And this is the importanc e of the America n presidentia l election , that it is an event of the first order on the world market .
Four year s ago I publishe d an essay on protectiv e tariffs and free trade, in Boston in Englis h and in Stuttgar t in German.
3 Here I demonstrated tha t England' s industria l monopol y could not be reconciled wit h the economi c developmen t of the other civilise d countries; tha t the protectiv e tariffs introduce d in Americ a since the Civil War 307 showe d Americans ' will to shake off the yoke of this monopoly, tha t thanks to the giganti c natura l resource s and the intellectual an d moral talents of the America n race this target has already bee n reached , and the custom s barrie r has becom e in America, n o less than in Germany , a fetter to industry .
And then I a F.
Engels , "Protection an d Free Trade".
— Ed.
wrote: If Americ a introduce s free trade, then it will beat Englan d on the worl d marke t in ten years.
Very well .
The presidentia l electio n of Novembe r 8, 1892 has opened th e way for free trade.
The protectiv e tariff in the form devised b y MacKinle y had becom e an unbearabl e fetter; the nonsensical pric e increas e for all importe d raw material s and foodstuffs, whic h affecte d the price of many domesti c products , had largely close d world market s to America n products , while the home market suffere d a glut of America n industria l products .
In fact, in the past few years the protectiv e tariff only served to ruin the small producers unde r the pressur e of the large producer s combine d in cartels an d trusts , and to surrende r the marke t and thus the consuming natio n to exploitatio n by the latter, that is to say the organised monopoly .
Americ a can only escape from this permanen t domestic industria l crisis caused by the protectiv e tariff by openin g itself up to the world market , and for this it must emancipat e itself from the protectiv e tariff, at least in its presen t nonsensica l form.
The tota l turn-abou t of public opinion demonstrate d by the election shows tha t it is determine d to do this.
Once establishe d on the world market, America— like, and through England—wil l irresistibl y be driven furthe r along the path of free trade.
And the n we shall experienc e an industria l battle as never before.
On all markets English products , particularl y textiles and iron goods, will have to fight with America n products , and finally lose.
Even now American cotton s and linens chase the English from the field.
Would you like to know who performe d the miracle of convertin g in one short yea r the cotton operative s of Lancashir e from furiou s opponents t o enthusiasti c advocate s of the legal eight-hou r day? Refer to the Neue Zeit, No.
2 of Octobe r this year, p.
56, where you can see how America n cottons and linens are displacin g the English step by step on the domesti c market , how Englis h import s have, since 1881, never reache d the American , and in 1891 only amounte d to about on e third of the latter.
308 And China is, beside India, much the main marke t for these textiles .
This is renewe d proof that with the turn of the century all relation s are shifting .
Transfe r the centre of gravity of the textile and iron industries fro m Englan d to America , and Englan d will become either a second Holland , whose bourgeoisi e live on their former greatness , and whos e proletaria t shrivels , or—it will reorganis e itself along socialist lines .
The first is not possible , the English proletaria t will not put up with it, it is far too numerou s and develope d for this.
Only the second remains .
The fall of protective tariffs in America means the ultimate victory of socialism in England.
331 And Germany ? Back in 1878 it won a position on the world market, whic h it is now losing step by step thanks to its foolish protective tarif f policy—wil l it insist upon continuin g obstinatel y to close for itself the path to the world market by taxing raw material s and foodstuffs , even agains t its America n competitors , who will throw themselve s into things quite differentl y from the Englis h competition hitherto ? Will the Germa n bourgeoisi e have the understanding an d courag e to follow the exampl e set by America , or will it, lethargi c as hitherto , wait until America n industry , grown all-powerful, forcibl y breaks the tariff-carte l betwee n the Junker s and the large-scal e manufacturers 309? And will the governmen t and the bourgeoisi e finally realise how marvellousl y clumsil y this precise moment ha s been chosen to crush the economi c forces of German y with new and prohibitiv e militar y burdens , when it should be entering int o industria l competitio n with the most youthfull y strong nation in the world, which has easily paid off its colossal war debt in a few years , and whose governmen t does not know what to do with the tax income ? The Germa n bourgeoisi e have—perhap s for the last time—th e opportunity finall y to perfor m a great deed.
One hundre d to one they are too narrow-minde d and too cowardl y to utilise this opportunity fo r anythin g except to prove that once and for all their time is up.

After concludin g his prepara -tory educatio n at Trier Gymnasium , Karl Marx studied from 1835 in Bonn and then in Berlin , first law and later philosophy , attaining hi s Dr.
Phil, i n Berlin in 1841 with a dissertatio n on the philosophy o f Epicurus.
3 In the same year he moved to Bonn in order to qualif y as a lecturer , but the obstacle s which the government lai d in the path of his friend Bruno Bauer, officiall y there as lecture r in theology , which culminate d in Bauer' s remova l from the university , soon made it clear to him that there was no room fo r him at a Prussian university.
—Thi s was the time when the younge r element s of the radical bourgeoisi e of the Rhineland , tinged wit h Young Hegelianism , urged, in agreemen t with the liberal leader s Camphausen and Hansemann, the publicatio n of a big oppositio n paper in Cologne ; Marx and Bauer were also consulted a s capabl e main contributors .
A concession—necessar y at that time—wa s quietly obtaine d by a devious route, and the Rheinische Zeitung appeared o n Januar y 1, 1842.
Marx contribute d lengthy article s from Bonn for the new paper ; foremos t among these were : a critique of proceeding s in the Rhine Provinc e Assembly, a study of the situatio n of the peasan t vintner s on the Mosel, and anothe r on wood theft and the relevan t legislation.

Marx's works drawn up by F.
Engels 3 October 184 2 he took over the managemen t of the paper and moved t o Cologne .
From this point the paper adopte d a sharply oppositional character .
But the managemen t was so adroit that despite firs t doubl e censorship , and then triple censorship , imposed upo n the paper (first the ordinar y censor , then the Regierungspräsident, and finall y a Mr.
von Saint-Pau l dispatche d ad hoc fro m Berlin) , the governmen t found this sort of newspape r hard to deal with and therefor e decide d to forbid furthe r publication o f the paper as of April 1, 1843.
Marx's resignatio n from the editoria l board 312 on this date bough t a three months ' stay of execution , bur then the paper was finally suppressed .
Marx the n decide d to move to Paris where Arnold Ruge als o wished t o turn, followin g the suppressio n of the Deutsche Jahrbücher at about the same time.
But first in Kreuznach he married Jenn y von Westphalen , sweethear t of his youth, to whom he had been engage d since the beginnin g of his universit y days.
The youn g couple reache d Paris in the autum n of 1843, and here Marx an d Ruge publishe d the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher, a journal o f which only the first issue appeared ; a continuatio n failed, partl y becaus e of the insuperabl e difficultie s of circulatin g it secretly i n Germany , and partly becaus e of the difference s of principle whic h very soon becam e apparen t betwee n the two editors.
Ruge remaine d tied up with Hegelia n philosoph y and political radicalism , while Marx threw himsel f into the study of political economy , the French socialists , and the history of France .
The resul t was his conversio n to socialism .
In Septembe r 1844, Fr.
Engel s visited Mar x in Paris for a few days: the two had been in correspondenc e since their joint work on the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher, and thei r collaboration , which only ended with the death of Marx, dates from this point.
The first fruit of this collaboratio n was a polemica l pamphle t against Bruno Bauer, with who m they had likewis e parted ways on principle s in the course o f the disintegratio n of the Hegelia n school : The Holy Family, or Critique of Critical Criticism.

Marx helpe d to edit a small Germa n weekly called Vorwärts!, published i n Paris, which poured biting scorn qn the wretchednes s of the Germa n absolutis m and sham constitutionalis m of the time.
This prompte d the Prussia n Governmen t to deman d that Guizot' s ministry expe l Marx from France .
It was agreed : in early 1845 Marx move d to Brussels , and Engels arrived ther e soon after-wards.
Her e Marx publishe d The Poverty of Philosophy.
Answer to the "Philosophy of Poverty" by M.
Proudhon, Brussel s and Paris, 1847, and also "Speec h on the Questio n of Free Trade" , Brussels , 1848.
In additio n he wrote occasiona l articles for the Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung.
In Januar y 1848 he drew up, togethe r with Engels, the Manifesto of the Communist Party o n the instruction s of the Centra l Authority o f the Communis t League , a secret propagand a society which Mar x and Engels had joine d in the spring of 1847.
313 The Manifesto ha s since appeare d in innumerabl e authorise d and unauthorised Germa n edition s and been translate d into nearly all European languages .
On the outbrea k of the 1848 Februar y Revolution , which brought abou t popula r movement s in Brussel s too, Marx was arrested an d expelle d from Belgium ; in the meantim e the Provisional Governmen t of the French Republi c had invited him to come back to Paris, so he returne d there.
At first in Paris he and his friends took a stand agains t the game of formin g legions , which gave the majorit y in the new govern -ment a simple means of riddin g themselve s of the "tiresome " foreign workers .
It was clear that such openly organise d Belgian , German, etc.
, legions would only be able to march across the frontiers int o a well-organise d trap, and this was indeed the case.
Marx an d the other leaders of the Communis t League obtaine d for abou t four hundre d unemploye d German s the same travel allowance a s the legionaries , so that they too could return to Germany.
In April Marx went to Cologne , and ort July 1 the Neue Rheinische Zeitung wa s published ther e under his management ; it appeared fo r the last time on May 19 the followin g year.
The editors wer e either threatene d with judicia l arrest , or with expulsion a s non-Prussians .
The latter fate befell Marx, who during hi s time in Brussel s had taken his release from the Prussian state .
During the existenc e of the paper he had to appear twice befor e the Jury, on Februar y 7, 1849 becaus e of a press misdemeanour, an d on the 8th on charge s of incitemen t to armed resistance t o the governmen t (at the time of the tax refusal , November 1848) ; both times he was acquitted.
314 After th e paper had been suppresse d Marx returne d to Paris, but after the demonstratio n of June 13315 he was faced with the choice o f either allowin g himsel f to be interne d in Brittan y or of turning hi s back on France once again.
He naturall y chose the latter an d moved to London , where he now finally establishe d his residence.
In Londo n he published : the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.

The forme r work was soon followe d by the continuation , The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, Ne w York, 1852, reissued i n Hambur g in 1869 and 1885.
The big Communis t trial in Cologn e gave rise to a further pamphlet , Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, Boston , 1853, latest edition Zurich , 1885.
From 1852 onward s Marx was London corresponden t of the New-York Tribune, an d for years virtual Europea n editor .
His articles ar e in part signed with his name, and in part publishe d as editorials: the y are not ordinar y articles , but extensiv e account s of the politica l and economi c positio n of the variou s countrie s of Europe, base d upon thoroug h study, and often constitutin g a whole serie s of articles .
The militar y essays amongs t them, on the Crimean War , the Indian Rebellion , etc.
, are by Engels.
Some of Marx's article s on Lord Palmersto n were reprinte d in Londo n in pamphlet form.
b His work for the Tribune onl y came to an end with the America n Civil War.
The yea r 1859 involve d Marx, on the one hand, in a polemic with Karl Vog t arising fro m the Italian War, which found its conclusion i n Herr Vogt by Karl Marx, London , 1860.
But on the other hand , it brough t the first fruits of his years of economi c studies i n the British Museu m in the form of Part One of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Berlin , 1859.
This Part One had scarcel y been publishe d when Marx discovere d that he was not yet completel y clear about the detaile d executio n of the basic idea s of the subsequen t parts; the manuscript , which is still extant, i s the best proof of this.
317 So he immediatel y started again from the beginning , and so, instead of the continuation , Capital was publishe d in 1867.
Book One: The Process of Production of Capital, Hamburg, 1867 .
While h e was workin g on all three volume s of Capital—the second an d third volume s at least in draft—Mar x finally again found an opportunit y for practica l work in the world of labour.
In 1864 the Internationa l Workin g Men's Associatio n was founded .
Many people , in particula r Frenchmen , have arrogate d to them-selves th e honou r of having been founder s of this Association .

Bu t one thing is certain : amongs t all those participatin g there wa s only one who was clear about what had to be done and wha t had to be founded ; and this was the man who back in 1848 had flung the call to the world: Workingme n of all lands, unite! At the foundatio n of the Internationa l Giusepp e Mazzin i too attempted t o win and utilise the element s coming togethe r for his mystical conspiratoria l democrac y Dio e popolo.
3 Bu t the drafts for the statute s and the Inaugura l Addres s submitte d in his name were rejecte d in favour of those edited by Marx, 318 and from this point Mar x was sure of the leadershi p of the International .
He wrote al l the promulgation s of the Genera l Council , includin g most notabl y The Civil War in France whic h appeare d after the fall of the Paris Commun e and was translate d into most Europea n languages.
This is not the place to relate the history of the International .
It is enoug h to say that Marx was able to draft statute s with principled motivation 13 under which French Proudhonists , Germa n Communists an d Englis h New Trade s Unionist s could work together i n unity, and that nothin g disturbe d the harmon y of the Association unti l there appeare d on the scene those people who have sinc e then attempte d to disrup t every workingmen' s move-ment, th e anarchist s under Bakunin .
It is clear that the strengt h of the Associatio n lay solely in the previousl y unheard-o f attemp t to unite the Europea n and America n proletariat ; the Genera l Counci l had no mean s but moral ones, not even funds ; instea d of the fable d "million s of the International " it generall y had only debts.
Never, probably , has so much been achieve d with so little money.
After th e Commun e the Internationa l becam e impossibl e in Europe.

When , however , such condition s emerged , the old form was outdated ; the movemen t had far outgrow n the old Interna -tional.
From thi s time Marx stayed aloof from public agitation , but this is not to sugges t he was any less active in the Europea n and American working-clas s movement .
He was in correspondenc e with almos t all the leaders in the various countries , who, wheneve r possible, consulte d him on importan t matters ; he increasingl y became th e much-sought-afte r and ever-willin g advise r of the valiant proletariat .
But despite all this, Marx was now able to devote himsel f once more to his studies , the field of which had greatly expande d in the meantime .
For a man who checke d every subject fo r its historica l origin and its preconditions , every single question naturall y produce d whole series of new questions .

4, 1892 24* [TO TH E EDITOR S OF THE BERLINER VOLKS-TRIBÜNE] The serie s of article s "The Jura Federatio n and Mikhai l Bakunin" publishe d in the Volks-Tribüne, constrains m e to a short rebuttal.
Although th e author 3 appear s to take pains to treat his subject objectively an d impartially , he in fact depicts it as the anarchis t gentlemen depicte d it themselve s and wished it to be depicted .
In particular h e has at his disposa l very extensiv e Bakuninis t material; h e utilises very little from the publication s of the Genev a opposing party , and nothin g at all from the publication s of the London Genera l Council .
I extract the most obviou s untruth s from only one of the articles (X of Novembe r 12).
It is incorrec t that in 1871 the Genera l Counci l summone d a "secret" conferenc e to London 321 of which "only th e anarchis t section s in Switzerlan d were not informed ; they, however , learned o f the plan", etc.
The conferenc e was just as public and just as secret as any committee meetin g of any Social-Democrati c party; it was not broadcast t o all and sundry in the newspaper s and reporter s were not invite d to the meetin g place.
The Jur a section s were in open rebellio n agains t the Genera l Council an d outsid e all official relation s with the same.
On the other han d there sat on the Genera l Counci l two Bakuninist anarchists an d member s of the Bakuninis t secret society, elected on the proposa l of "dictator " Marx: Robin and Bastelica .
Robin in particular provide d relation s with the Jurassians , propose d on a Louis Héritier.
— Ed.
their behalf, back in March 1871, the same conferenc e which they later disavowed , and also informe d them that it had been summoned.
Anythin g else is an anarchis t lie.
The conferenc e "which wa s to assembl e at Marx's place .
.
.
was held .
.
.
in Marx's house" .
Stupid lie ; it was held in the Blue Posts, an inn near Tottenham Cour t Road, right in the so-calle d French Quarter .
The compositio n of the conferenc e is also given wrongly , as is the poin t of differenc e on a paragraph , not of the Rules, but of their motivatin g introduction .
In its French translatio n the first Paris (Proudhonist ) local committe e had falsifie d the relevan t passage: "Th e economica l emancipatio n of the workin g classes is [.
.
.
] the great end to which every politica l movemen t ought to be subordinate a s a means" 3—as: "the grea t goal, in the face of which every politica l movemen t must withdraw".
322 While th e papers of the Geneva Congress 323 were confiscate d by the Bonapartis t police in transit throug h France , and only finally released afte r interventio n by the English Foreig n Office , the old Paris translatio n was immediatel y reprinte d in Geneva , whereupo n the later anarchist s could claim that the Genev a Congres s had so decided.
Thi s HUMBU G was brough t to an end, though to the great sorrow o f the Bakuninists , by the publicatio n in 1871 of an authentic English , French and Germa n text of the Rules, b with which th e Genera l Counci l had been charge d by the same Genev a Congress.
Befor e me I have the copy of the Rules in which Marx entered th e change s decide d by the Genev a Congress ; these are wholly confine d to the articles of the Rules, and have no effect on the motivatin g introduction .
Neither i s it true that the Londo n conferenc e decide d to place "the anarchis t movemen t of the Jura under the comman d of the Genev a committee".
And it is here that I begin to doubt the honourabl e intention s of the author .
Either he can read, or he cannot .
If he can read, he can only gather from the conferenc e decisions : 1.
that the Jura committee wa s deprive d of the name Comité romand (which it had arrogated), an d that this name was awarde d to the old Genev a committee; 2 .
that the Jurassian s were urged to get along with the Genevans; 3 .

own federatio n entitle d Jura Federation.
3 The conferenc e thus did nothing excep t to leave their own complet e autonom y to the Genevans an d the Jurassians .
Enough.
Th e autho r is, or acts like, an innocen t child who believes t o the word everythin g said by the poor, slandere d anarchist lambs .
Our reporte r knows not a word of that which these gentleme n preferre d to keep quiet, that is to say nothin g about th e backgroun d to the whole dispute .
Behind the public "Alliance o f Social Democracy " founde d by Bakuni n there hid a secret Allianc e with the aim of puttin g into the hands of the anarchists contro l over the whole International.
324 This secret Alliance wa s very widesprea d in the Jura, in Italy and in Spain.
The Genera l Counci l receive d proof of this first from Spain , and later fro m Genev a the Rules and many other document s of this innocent plo t agains t the Europea n workers ' movement .
It was these document s upon which the Hagu e Congres s of 1872 adjudicated, whe n it exclude d Bakuni n and Guillaume from the International.
325 And all this, and much more to correc t the now warmed-up anarchis t falsification s of history may be studied in the work commissione d by the Hagu e Congress : L'Alliance de la Démocratie Socialiste et l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, London 8c Hamburg, 1873 , Germa n by Kokosky: Ein Komplott gegen die Internationale, Brunswick , Bracke , 1874.

Hence , the followin g report , which I have translate d from Russkija Vjedomosti (Russia n Gazette) 3, Moscow , Octobe r 14, 1892, Old Style, will be of interest .
Not only is group marriage , e.
g.
, the right of sexual intercours e betwee n a number of men and a number of women, expressl y stated to be in full practice , but it is shown to bear a form closel y approximatin g the punalua n marriag e of the Hawaiians, tha t is, the most develope d and most classica l phase of group marriage .
Wherea s the typical punalua n family consiste d of a numbe r of brother s (natura l and collateral ) marrie d to a number of natura l and collatera l sisters, on the Island of Sakhali n we find that a man is marrie d to all his brothers ' wives and to all his wife's sisters, which , from the female viewpoint , means that his wife has the righ t to free sexual intercours e with her husband' s brother s and her sisters' husbands .
Thus, the only differenc e betwee n this and the typical form of punalua n marriag e is that the husband' s brothers an d the sisters ' husband s are not necessaril y the same persons.
It is to be observed , further , that the report also confirm s what I stated in The Origin of the Family, 4t h edition , pp.
28-29 b ; that group marriag e by no means looks like what it is fancied to be by the philistin e in his brothel-tainte d imagination ; that the people married i n group s do not lead openly anythin g like the life of depravity tha t the philistin e leads in secret; and that this form of a Pyemia BidoMocmu.

349 marriage, a t least in those example s of it that still exist today, differs i n practic e from the loose pairin g marriage , or from polygamy, onl y in that custom allows a number of cases of sexual intercourse whic h under other circumstance s would be severel y punished.
Th e fact that the exercis e of this right is graduall y dying ou t only proves that this form of marriag e is doome d to extinction, whic h is confirme d by the rarity of the cases met with now.
For the rest, the whole descriptio n is interestin g for the reason that it shows once again how similar , and in fundamental s identical, ar e the social institution s of these primitiv e people who are in about the same stage of development .
Most of what is related abou t these Mongoloid s of Sakhali n applie s to the Dravidian tribe s of India, to the South Sea Islander s at the time of their discovery , and to the America n Indians .
The report states: "At a meeting of the Anthropologica l Section of the Friend s of Natura l History Society, hel d in Moscow 3 on Octobe r 10" (Octobe r 22, New Style), "N.
A.
Yanchu k reported o n an interestin g communicatio n made by Mr.
Sternber g on the Sakhali n Giliaki, a tribe that has been little investigated , and living on the cultura l level b of savages.
Th e Giliaki know neithe r agricultur e nor the art of pottery ; they obtain their mean s of subsistenc e mainly by huntin g and fishing ; they heat water in a wooden troug h by droppin g red-ho t stones into it, etc.
Particularl y interestin g are their famil y and gens institutions .
A Giliak calls not only his natural father, but all the latter' s brother s father; the wives of these brothers , as well as his mother' s sisters, h e calls his mothers ; and the childre n of all these 'fathers ' and 'mothers' 0 he calls his brother s and sisters .
As is well known , a similar way of naming d prevail s among th e Iroquoi s and other Indian tribes in North America , as well as among some tribe s in India.
Among these, however , it has long ceased to correspon d to existing conditions , wherea s among the Giliaki it serves to designat e conditions that exist to this day.
Eve n today every Giliak has conjugal rights to the wives of his brothers and the sisters of his wifee; (a t all events, the exercis e of these rights is not regarde d as a transgression f).
These survival s of group marriag e based on gentile organisation s are reminiscen t of the celebrate d punalua n family , which still existed in the Sandwich Island s in the first half of the presen t century .
This form of family and gen s relationship 11 serve s as the basis of the Giliaki' s social and gentil e organisation.

Naturally , a gens constitute d in this way may have a very large numbe r of members.
Th e life of the gens proceed s on the followin g principles .
Marriag e in the gens is absolutel y prohibited .
The wife of a decease d Giliak passes , on the decision o f the gens, to one of his brother s (natura l or nominal).
b The gens maintains al l its member s who are unfit to work.
'There are no beggar s among us,' said a Giliak to the reporter : 'if anybod y is poor, the khal (gens) feeds him.
' Furthermore, th e member s of the gens are united by commo n sacrifice s and festivals, a commo n burial ground , etc.
"The gen s guarantee s the life and safety of every one of its member s from attack by member s of anothe r gens.
c The punitiv e means for this is blood revenge, d which owing to the influenc e of the Russians , has greatly subside d of late.
Women are entirely exemp t from the operatio n of blood revenge.
— In some cases, extremel y rare, member s of other gentes are adopte d by the gens.
As a general rule the property o f a decease d membe r must not leave the gens.
In this respect , the well-known rul e of the Twelv e Tables : 'Si suos herede s non habet, gentiles familiam habento'—'I f he has no heirs, then the member s of the gens shall inherit' 328—is i n operatio n in the literal sense of the word among the Giliaki .
Not a single importan t event in the Giliak' s life takes place withou t the participatio n of the gens .
Until comparativel y recently , one or two generation s ago, the oldest member o f the gens was the head, the 'starost',e o f the gens.
At the presen t time, however, th e function s of the elder of the gens are confine d almos t entirely to superintending religiou s rites.
Often the member s of the gens are scattere d over places ver y remot e from each other; but even though separated , they remembe r each other , visit each other, help and protec t each other, etc.
Incidentally , the Giliak doe s not leave his fellow-gentile s or the graves of the gens unless absolut e necessity compel s him to do so.
The life of the gens has a strong impact upon the Giliak' s mentality , character , ethics and institutions .
The habit of discussin g all matters collectively , the necessit y of having constantl y to act in the interest s of his fellow-gentiles, mutua l obligatio n in matter s of blood revenge / the necessit y and custom o f living in large yurtas togethe r with scores of his fellows , of living constantly amon g the people , have all served to make the Giliak sociabl e and communicative.
Th e Giliaki are extremel y hospitable , they love to entertai n guests and to go visitin g themselves .
The noble custom of hospitalit y manifest s itself particularly i n times of need.
In hard years, when the Giliak lacks food for himself and his dogs, he does not beg for alms; he goes off visiting , certain of findin g sustenance—and sometime s for a fairly long period .
"Among th e Sakhali n Giliaki one rarely meets with crime due to selfish motives .
The Gilia k keeps his valuable s in a shed, which is never locked.
He is so sensitiv e to shame tha t if he is found guilty of some shamefu l act he goes off into the taiga and hangs himself .
Murde r among the Giliak i is very rare, and in most cases is committed i n fits of anger: at all events it is never committe d for selfish motives .
In his relation s with others g the Giliak display s truthfulness , loyalty to his word and conscientiousness.

"Notwithstanding thei r long subjectio n to the China-ise d Manchurian s and the corrupting influenc e of the colonisation 3 of the Amur Region , the Giliaki in their morals hav e retaine d many of the virtues peculia r to primitiv e tribes.
But the fate of their social system is irrevocabl y sealed .
Anothe r generatio n or two, and the Giliaki o n the mainlan d will have becom e completel y Russified , and with the benefits o f civilisatio n they will acquire all its vices.
The Sakhali n Giliaki , being more or less remove d from the centres of Russian settlement , have some chance of preserving themselve s in their purity somewha t longer .
But even on them the Russian populatio n is beginnin g to exercis e its influence .
From all the village s they travel to Nikolayevs k to make purchase s or to seek employment ; and every Giliak who return s from such employmen t to his native village carries with him the same atmosphere tha t the town worke r carries into the Russia n village .
Moreover , employment i n town, with its vicissitude s of fortune , is more and more destroyin g the primitiv e equalit y which is the predominatin g featur e of the simple economi c life of people like the Giliaki .

[ON TH E LATES T CAPE R OF THE PARI S POLICE ] The bourgeoi s press of Paris announce s with great pomp that the polic e have uncovere d a very vile plot.
A number of "Russia n Nihilists" hav e conspire d to dispatc h to eternit y the gentle Tsar and Autocra t of All the Russias a; but the police have been on their guard, th e "transgressor s and aggressors " have been caught , the magnanimous Fathe r of the Russia n Fatherlan d has been saved.
Seen in the light of day it turns out that the "Russia n Nihilists " deserve thi s name insofar as they have nihil—nothing—to d o with Russians.
The y are simply Poles who only have the misfortun e to have bee n born unde r the sceptr e of the Little Fathe r in Petersburg, peopl e who lived very quietly and retiringl y in Paris, and wer e not simple-minde d enoug h to hatch murde r plots— sensible peopl e today leave such busines s to the police.
The simple necessity o f presentin g to the public the Polish names of these "Russian Nihilists " was sufficien t to make untenabl e the whole rigmarole o f murde r and plottin g even for the police.
They had to instruct thei r Havas-Reuter S32 that the person s would simply be expelled fro m France .
Why suc h a hubbub everywhere ? Very simple .
The ruler s of the opportunist-radica l bourgeoi s republic—th e ministers, senators , deputies—are , all of them, mixed up in the Panama scandal, 333 some as bribe-takers , others as accomplice s and hushers-up.
I n their view, the public has occupie d itself long enough wit h this sid e of their grimy existences .
They think: the world ha s now said enoug h about us discreditin g the Republi c with ou r swindling .
Let us now demonstrat e that we are also a Alexande r III.
— Ed.
capable o f discreditin g this Republi c politically .
Let us demonstrat e that in grovellin g to the Tsar we can beat the blessed Bismarc k by six boot-lickin g lengths .
The Russia n Embass y wishes to inspect the papers o f the Polish émigrés, so let us prove our burnin g desire to lay befor e it everythin g it wants: not only the papers , but the Poles themselves a t the same time, and the whole of France if need be.
We canno t complai n if the bourgeoi s Republi c ruins itself in this way.
Its heirs stand at the door: not the monarchists , busily plotting agai n but not dangerou s for all that, but the socialist s who will be the heirs.
But what is beyond the pale, even for us, is the stupidity o f these people , the powers-that-b e in France at this time.
They be g for the grace and favour of official Russia, they lick its boots, they demea n themselve s before this Russia n robber band, they appoin t the Tsar real ruler of France and directo r of French policy—and thi s Tsar is in a position of impotenc e which makes it absolutely impossibl e for him to render any sort of real service to France.
Th e presen t winter proves that a permanen t state of starvation fo r years to come has been declare d in Russia 3; the resources o f the countr y have been exhauste d for a long time to come, th e financia l situatio n is absolutel y desperate .
It is not France whic h needs Russia , on the contrary , it is Russia which would b e completel y paralyse d withou t the moral suppor t of France.
I f these French bourgeoi s had a bit of sense, they could force thei r Russian ally to anythin g which involve d no money and no war.
Instead they lie prostrat e before it in the dust, allowin g themselves t o be exploite d for Russia n state ends as not even Prussia wa s in its deepes t abasement .
And they imagin e that they are bein g cunnin g and have no idea, the stupid devils, how they are bein g laughe d at in Petersburg .
Paris vaut bien une messe —Paris is worth a mass, as Henri IV said when h e obtaine d the surrende r of Paris by convertin g to Catholicism.
La France vaut bien une Marseillaise—France i s worth a Marseillaise—said Alexande r III when, at the momen t of his greatest politica l helplessnes s and perplexity , Admira l Gervais handed hi m Franc e on a plate.

THE ITALIA N PANAM A I "Italia, Italia , you really have canaglia " runs a German studen t song on Italian bugs and fleas.
But apart from the six-legge d canaglia ther e are the two-legge d sort there as well, and la belle Italia insist s on showin g that in this respec t it is not outranke d either by la belle France wit h its Panam a Affair, or by that chaste Germania with its piety, sanctimoniousnes s and the Guelp h fund.
336 Italy has its paper-mone y turned out by six banks, two Tuscan , one Neapolitan , one Sicilian and two Roman : the Banca Romana and the Banca Nazionale .
The banknote s of these six privilege d banks hav e currenc y as fully valid legal tender under a law which expired som e years ago, and was then extende d from year to year up to Decembe r 31, 1892 and finally for three month s up to March 31 , 1893.
Back unde r the Crispi administratio n in 1889 an investigatio n was ordere d into the managemen t of these banks, in view of the renewal o f this bank privileg e which had becom e necessary , and because o f the disquietin g rumour s that were circulating .
The Banca Nazional e was investigate d by Senato r Consiglio , the Banca Romana by Senato r Alvisi, an honourabl e man, to whom was assigned a s expert Biagini , a capable official from the Ministr y of Finance.
Nothin g is known up to the presen t as to what Consigli o has discovered ; after Alvisi' s death a copy of the Alvisi report together wit h all documentar y evidence , came into hands generall y described a s unauthorised , and this led to the Panamino , the little Panama, a s the Italian s call it.
At that time the Crispi administratio n quietly pigeonhole d the report.
Alvis i referre d to the matter in the Senate a few times, threatened a scandal, but always allowed himsel f to be silenced .
He was silen t too when Ministe r Miceli , who had ordere d the investigation, presente d to the Chambe r Commissio n on the next annual prolongatio n of the Bank Law an enormousl y white -washing repor t on the Banca Romana; and he implore d his friend Alvisi no t to compromis e him and the credit of his countr y through disclosures .
Crispi fell, Rudini replace d him; Rudini fell, and was succeede d by the Giolitt i administratio n now in power .
The definitiv e bank law, which was to reorganis e the banks and extend thei r privileg e for six years, was still up in the air.
Nobod y wanted t o nibble this dangerou s bait.
As in the children' s game "The spar k still lives" the glowin g spill passed from hand to hand, until finally , on Decembe r 21, the last spark was crushe d out, cruelly an d withou t authorisation .
As recentl y as Decembe r 6, 1892, Giolitti had introduce d a bill to prolon g the bank privileg e for six years.
Bu t as a result of the embarrassing rumour s unauthorisedl y circulatin g about gross irregularities i n bank administration , on Decembe r 21 Giolitti was quick to deman d only a stay of executio n for three months—unti l March 31 .
During the debate Deputy Colajann i took the floor and read out , to universa l astonishment , various passage s from Alvisi' s general repor t on the Banca Romana, and from Biagini' s special report o n the books and holding s which he had checked .
Fine things cam e to light! Nine million francs in illegall y issued excess banknotes; a n intermingling , contrar y to the statutes , of the bank funds an d the gold reserv e extremel y agreeabl e to the bank governor an d cashier ; a portfoli o full of totally irredeemabl e fictitious bills ; 73 million from the bank funds advance d to 179 privileged persons ; 33!/2 millio n of this amoun t to just 19 persons ; amongst th e bank debtor s there figure d Tanlongo , the bank governor, wit h over one millio n and Prince Giulio Torlonia , chairman o f the board of directors , with 4 million, etc.
, etc.
Colajanni gav e no furthe r names , but made it clear that he knew more tha n he had said, and demande d a parliamentar y investiga -tion of the banks.
Another deputy , Gavazzi , then read out a further passag e from the report , accordin g to which the Banca Romana had mad e large advances t o lawyers , journalist s and politica l figures , and that such special client s had receive d monies up to 12 million , which did not figure in the publishe d balanc e sheets .
Up jumpe d Miceli , the ex-minister , who had ordere d the investigation unde r Crispi.
Up jumpe d Giolitti , Crispi, Rudini, one after another , the three prime minister s involved , to declare that these disclosure s were fabrications .
25-1550 And wha t a depth of moral indignatio n they displayed ! A German commercia l traveller , confronte d with goods ordere d from him on sound sample s and then delivere d in poor quality , could no t have shown more righteou s rage.
On the same day deputie s exchange d banknote s of the Banca Romana to the value of over 50,000 francs at the bank counte r of the Chamber , and the shares (nomina l par 1,000 fr.
) fell by 100 francs .
But after the heroic ministeria l speeches , the stock exchange peopl e were on top again that very same evening .
Impressions wer e that the scanda l was dead and buried .
II But ever y word uttere d by Colajann i was true, and it was scarcely on e third of what the investigatio n repor t contained .
Tanlongo th e governor , Lazzaron i the chief cashier and Torlonia , chairman o f the board of directors , had quite cosily authorise d advances u p to nine million .
Accordin g to Tanlongo' s testimon y the bank wa s altogethe r manage d "cosily " — patriarcalmente ; so cosily that the funds which should have guarantee d easier credit for commerce an d industr y had been loaned on bad and practicall y irredeemable mortgages , or to person s whose knowledg e of industry wa s confine d to a cavalier treatmen t of every financia l obligation, agains t constantl y prolonge d bills of exchange , or even on open curren t account .
It was run so cosily that graduall y almost all journalists an d no fewer than one-hundred-and-fifty members of the current Chamber of Deputies, mos t of them notoriousl y insolvent , or even livin g solely upon debts, were carried on the books of the bank as debtors .
A list of these clients was also attache d to Alvisi's report; on this list, apart from only one deputy of the right wing, Arbib, there figure d almos t all persuasion s of the left with sums of 500,000-600,000 fr .
per head.
The bearer of a name honoure d throughout th e world 3 is amongs t them, as are two curren t ministers—Grimaldi an d Martini ; Grimald i is even one of the legal advisers o f the bank with an annual salary of 25,000 fr.
That was already quit e jolly, but that was in 1889, that was just the beginning , that was not even a Panamino , it was only a Panaminetto , a very very small Panama .
These delicat e matter s and others , naturall y includin g exagger -ated rumours , spread slowly and bit by bit amongs t the public , a Menott i Garibaldi.
— Ed.
once Colajanni' s speech had started things off.
The public began to withdra w deposit s from the Banca Romana —in a few days more tha n 9 million of the total 14 million deposited—an d to regard it s notes with distrust .
The governmen t felt that action must now be taken.
Somethin g which had been shuffle d for years from on e administratio n to another—regulatio n of the banks and paper-money—was no w to be accomplishe d helter-skelter .
At the beginning o f Januar y negotiation s were initiate d on the amalgama -tion of the two Roman and the two Tuscan banks as one large credit institution , and at the same time the administratio n ordere d a new inspectio n of the banks.
The Banca Nazionale , which was to constitute th e core of the new institution , naturall y decline d to take ove r the sins of the Banca Romana unseen; i t made difficulties an d low offers .
All this got around ; distrus t grew into panic.
Th e city of Rome withdre w from the Banca Romana its credit balanc e of over one million , and the Saving s Bank also retrieved it s deposi t of over 500,00 0 fr.
The shares of the Banca Romana, which ha d fallen after Colajanni' s speech to 670, were quoted o n Januar y 15 at just 504 fr.
for 1,000 fr.
face value.
In the north of the countr y people began refusin g to accept the notes of this bank.
And now rumour s seeped out to the public about the still more astounding result s of the new inspectio n of the Banca Romana.
Admittedly, Princ e Giulio Torloni a had paid off his debt: on January 13, 4 million , on the 14th a further 600,00 0 fr.
, on the 15th the remainin g 2 million.
Admittedly , Tanlong o the governor , and Lazzaron i the cashier had made over to the bank their entire large fortune s agains t their debts.
Admittedly , "a very high-ranking person"—th e Corriere di Napoli pointe d out with the broadest o f hints at the king 3—had pai d the bank debts of Minister Grimald i and the member s of his family.
Admittedly , the constitutional-radical Deput y Fortis had issued a declaratio n that the credi t granted him had been sanctione d in his capacit y of legal adviser t o the bank.
But what was all this against the news that the new inspectio n had reveale d that the Banca Romana, which wa s permitted t o issue 70 million in banknotes , had put 133 million in circulation; that , in order to concea l this, fake creditor s to the tune of 49 million figure d in the books, and that Governo r Tanlong o had withdraw n 25 million on a simple receipt dated as recentl y as January 3 , 1893 (Secolo, Januar y 21-22) .
Furthe r it was whispere d that the gold reserve s had, it is true, been found to be in order, a Umbert o I.
— Ed.
25* but only becaus e Baron Michèle Lazzaroni , nephew o f the chief cashier, ha d borrowe d from Swiss busines s friends sundry million s in cash for a few days speciall y for this purpose , promisin g he would immediatel y return them in natura after the inspectio n had been made ; but this will be somewha t difficult , as the governmen t has, in the meantime , impounde d all the funds of the Banca Romana.
And now disclosure s came rattlin g out here, there and everywhere; no w the names of the 150 deputie s circulate d with greater o r lesser accurac y and certainty ; now it could no longer be denied tha t at least the last three administration s had known all about th e business .
That they had put the money of the bank regularly an d in large quantitie s at the disposa l of their supporter s for electio n purposes , that they had frequentl y discusse d the misappropriations i n the Counci l of Minister s and had intentional -ly kept them secret in full knowledg e of the responsibilit y they thus incurred—tha t they had thus assente d to their continuation .
How pal e in contras t was Biagini' s report publishe d in the Corriere di Napoli, Januar y 19-20.
The Panamin o was there.
Ill The crisi s could no longer be avoided .
Amongs t the people who had cheate d with the bank and blown and blued its funds—b y means o f honest tick, of course—on e section dispose d of public power, th e other not.
It was abundantl y clear that as soon as the knife wa s put to their throats , the first section would sacrific e the second.
On e accomplic e took the lofty decisio n to be the hangma n of the other.
Just as in France .
There too Rouvier , Floquet , Freycinet an d Co.
similarl y sacrifice d Lessep s and Fontane; they and thei r accomplice s had often enough , as Charle s Lessep s said, "put the knife to our throats " to squeeze , from Panama , funds for political purposes .
In exactly the same way Giolitt i and Grimald i sacrificed thei r bosom friend Tanlongo , after they and their predecessors ha d extracte d from him bank money for electora l and pressur e purpose s for so long that nothing remaine d but the crash.
An d when Grimaldi' s debts had been paid off in the familiar secretiv e way, it was he who called loudes t for Tanlongo' s arrest.
But Tanlong o is a thoroughl y crafty old Italian who knows all the trick s of the trade, not a greenhor n in swindlin g like Charle s Lesseps an d the other puppets , who had to run Panam a for Reinach an d Co.
Tanlong o is a pious man who went to mass every morning a t 4; here he fixed his deals with representative s and middlemen—no scanda l on me, dear child a—whom h e did not want to see on his bank premises .
Tanlong o was on excellen t terms wit h the Vatican , and he is said to have conveve d into the safety of the Vatican , untouchabl e to the Italian police , a small casket containin g those document s which guarante e him agains t his powerfu l friends and patrons , those document s which he does not wish to entrus t too nastily to the law.
For in Italy with its Panamino, jus t as in Franc e with its Panama , there are strong suspicions tha t the domicilar y searche s by the law sometime s serve not to bring document s to light, but rather to make them disappear.
An d Tanlong o feels that certain document s which are to defen d him and clarify the real state of affairs are not safe with the Italia n examinin g magistrate , but only in the Vatican .
Enough.
Scarcel y had the ministr y conclude d the busines s of the Banca Nazionale , by which the latter takes over the entire assets and liabilitie s of the Banca Romana and pay s the shareholder s 450 fr.
for each 1,000 fr.
share; scarcely did it believe that it had thereby protecte d from publicatio n the names of the politica l bank debtors, tha n worth y Tanlong o met his fate—th e ingratitud e which is the reward of bourgeoi s politics .
From the evenin g of January 1 6 his house was watched ; on the nineteent h he and chief cashier Lazzaron i were arrested .
This did not hit him unexpectedly .
Earlie r he had told a journalist fro m the Parlamente.
"They ma y lock me up, but they should conside r that they will be playing a bad card .
.
.
if they want to hold me responsibl e for the sins of other people then I shall be force d to create a scandal.
.
.
They want to ruin me? Then I shall drag into the public ey e the names of people who demanded from me million upon million.
Ho w often di d I say: I cannot provid e them, the only reply was: they are necessar y (occorrono).
An d I have the proof of this .
.
.
it is always the same; the more I did, the more the y kicked me in the face; but if I fall then I shall be in good company.
" And whe n the sick old man, who had been held in custody until then in this palace, was taken to Regina Coel i prison o n the 25th, he said to the official s who accompanie d him: "I shall come, but I reserve th e right to make disclosures, " and to his family he said: "They woul d like to see me die in prison , but I have strengt h enough t o take revenge.
" He does not look the man to go to pieces in open court session , like the Paris Panam a director s who, instead of crushin g their prosecutors wit h the incriminatin g facts, ten times as grave, which a H.

stood at their disposal , begged in silence for a mild sentence .
Palsied a s he is, the newspaper s describ e him as a large boney man, "a real cuirassie r of seventy" , and his whole past vouche s that he knows he can only find salvatio n in violent combat , in the toughest resistance ; and so it will surely come that one fine day the notoriou s cassetta d'oro* wil l find its way from the Vatica n to the courtroom , and spread its content s on the court table.
Bon appétit ! In the meantim e the Chamber s went into session again on the 25th, an d the scanda l has started up there too.
Giolitti can only shout to his 150 what Rouvie r shoute d to his 104: If we had not taken thi s money , then you would not be seated here.
And that is a fact.
And Crispi and Rudin i can only say the same.
But that is not the end of the matter .
Furthe r revelation s are bound to follow, both in the Chambe r and in the courtroom .
The Panamino , like the Panama , stands only at the start of its development .
And wha t is the moral of the story? That the Panama , and the Panamino, an d the Guelp h funds demonstrat e the whole of bourgeois politics , both the pleasin g squabbl e betwee n the bourgeoi s parties themselves , and their collectiv e resistanc e to the pressur e of the workin g class, canno t be undertake n withou t enormou s volumes o f money ; that these volume s of money are used for purposes whic h cannot be publicl y admitted ; and that owing to the tight-fistedness o f the bourgeoisi e government s find themselve s increasingly constraine d to obtain by unutterabl e means the cash for these unutterabl e ends.
"We take the money where we find it," said Bismarck , who must know.
And we have just seen "where we find it".

Turati 365 TO THE ITALIA N READE R [PREFACE T O THE ITALIA N EDITIO N (1893 ) OF THE MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY] 33 7 The publicatio n of the Manifesto of the Communist Party coincided, on e may say, with March 18, 1848, the day of the revolutions i n Milan and Berlin , which were armed uprising s of the two nation s situate d in the centre, the one, of the continen t of Europe, an d the other, of the Mediterranean ; two nation s until then enfeeble d by divisio n and interna l strife, and thus fallen under foreig n domination .
While Italy was subject to the Empero r of Austria , German y underwen t the yoke, not less effectiv e though more indirect , of the Tsar of all the Russias .
The consequence s of March 18 , 1848, freed both Italy and German y from this disgrace ; if from 1848 to 1871 these two great nations were reconstitute d and someho w again put on their own, it was, as Karl Marx used to say, becaus e the men who suppresse d the revolutio n of 1848 were, nevertheless, it s testamentar y executor s in spite of themselves.
338 Everywhere tha t revolutio n was the work of the workin g class; it was the latter that built the barricade s and paid with its lifeblood .
Only the Paris workers , in overthrowin g the government , had the very definit e intentio n of overthrowin g the bourgeoi s regime .
But conscious thoug h they were of the fatal antagonis m existin g between thei r own class and the bourgeoisie , still, neither the economic progres s of the countr y nor the intellectua l developmen t of the mass of French worker s had as yet reached the stage which would hav e made a social reconstructio n possible .
In the final analysis, therefore , the fruits of the revolutio n were reaped by the capitalist class .
In the other countries , in Italy, in Germany , in Austria, th e workers , from the very outset, did nothin g but raise the bourgeoisi e to power .
But in any countr y the rule of the bourgeoisie i s impossibl e withou t nationa l independence .
There-fore, the revolutio n of 1848 had to bring in its train the unity and autonomy o f the nation s that had lacked them up to then: Italy, Germany, Hungary .
Poland will follow in turn.
Thus, if the revolutio n of 1848 was not a socialist revolution , it paved th e way, prepare d the ground for the latter.
Throug h the impetus give n to large-scal e industr y in all countries , the bourgeoi s regime durin g the last forty-fiv e years has everywher e created a numerous, concentrate d and powerfu l proletariat .
It has thus raised, to use the languag e of the Manifesto, it s own grave-diggers .
Without restorin g autonom y and unity to each nation , it will be impossible t o achiev e either the internationa l union of the proletariat, o r the peacefu l and intelligen t co-operatio n of these nations towar d commo n aims.
Just imagin e joint internationa l action b y the Italian , Hungarian , German , Polish and Russia n workers unde r the politica l condition s precedin g 1848! The battle s fough t in 1848 were thus not fought in vain.
Nor hav e the forty-fiv e years separatin g us from that revolutionar y epoch passe d to no purpose .
The fruits are ripening , and all I wish is that the publicatio n of this Italian translatio n may augur as well for the victory of the Italian proletaria t as the publicatio n of the original di d for the internationa l revolution .
The Manifesto doe s full justice to the revolutionar y part played by capitalis m in the past.
The first capitalis t nation was Italy.
The close of the feudal Middle Ages, and the openin g of the moder n capitalist er a are marke d by a colossal figure: an Italian , Dante, both the last poet of the Middle Ages and the first poet of moder n times.
Today, as in 1300, a new historica l era is approaching .
Will Italy giv e us the new Dante , who will mark the hour of birth of this new , proletaria n era?

Title pag e of the pamphle t Can Europe Disarm? FOREWORD The article s reprinte d here were publishe d in the Berlin newspaper Vorwärts i n March 1893 , during the Reichsta g debate on the Militar y Bill.
In them I proceed from the assumptio n that is increasingl y gaining genera l acceptance : that the system of standin g armies has been carrie d to such extreme s throughou t Europ e that it must either brin g economi c ruin to the people s on accoun t of the military burden , or else degenerat e into a genera l war of extermination, unles s the standin g armies are transforme d in good time into a militia based on the universa l arming of the people .
L attemp t to prove that this transformatio n is possibl e right at this moment , even for the presen t government s and in the presen t political situation .
I thus take this situatio n as my basis and for the time bein g propos e only such means as could be adopte d by any government o f the day withou t jeopardisin g nationa l security .
I simply see k to establis h that from a purely militar y point of view there is nothin g whateve r to preven t the gradua l abolitio n of standing armies ; and that, if these armie s are nevertheles s maintained, i t is for politica l and not military reasons—that , in a word, th e armies are intende d to provid e protectio n not so much against th e externa l enemy as the interna l one.
However, I conside r the gradua l reductio n of the term of service b y internationa l treaty , which forms the core of my argument, t o be the simples t and quickes t way possibl e of effectin g the genera l transitio n from a standin g army to the arming of the people organise d as a militia.
The terms of such a treaty would naturally var y accordin g to the natur e of the contractin g governments an d the politica l situatio n of the day.
And things could no t possibl y be more favourabl e than at present ; if it is possible eve n today to set a maximum ter m of service of two years as a starting point, in a few years it may be possibl e to choose a much shorte r period of time.
By makin g the physica l and militar y trainin g of all male youths an essentia l conditio n for the transitio n to the new system , I expressly preclud e the possibilit y of the militar y system propose d here bein g confuse d with any other militia now in existence , e.

, the Swis s one.
London, Marc h 28, 1893 F.
Engels I For the past twenty-fiv e years all Europe has been arming on a hitherto unprecedente d scale.
Every major power is seekin g to surpass anothe r in militar y might and readines s for war.
Germany , France an d Russia are exhaustin g themselve s in their efforts to outdo on e another .
At this very momen t the Germa n governmen t is demandin g from the people a new exertio n so tremendou s that even the presen t tame Reichsta g shrink s away from it.
Is it not folly, then , to talk of disarmament ? And yet in all countrie s the classes of people who almos t exclusively hav e to provid e the bulk of the soldier s and pay the bulk of the taxes are crying out for disarmament .
And yet everywhere th e effort has reache d the stage where its strength — here the recruits , there the money , somewher e else both—i s beginning t o fail.
Is there no way out of this blind alley except through a war of destructio n such as the world has never seen? I maintain : disarmamen t and thus a guarante e of peace is possible, i t is even comparativel y easy to carry out, and German y more tha n any other civilise d state has the power, as well as the mission, t o carry it out.
After th e war of 1870-71 , the superiorit y of the system of universal compulsor y militar y servic e with a reserve and Land-wehr—even i n its then stunte d Prussia n form 340—over th e system of conscriptio n by proxy had been conclusivel y demonstrated .
All the continenta l countrie s adopte d it in more or less modifie d forms.
There would not have been any great harm in this itself.
An army that has its main reserv e in middle-age d marrie d men is by its very nature less offensiv e than was the conscrip t army of Louis Napoleon , which was heavily permeate d by paid proxies — recruited professiona l soldiers .
But then came the annexatio n of Alsace-Lorraine, whic h turned the Peace of Frankfur t into a mere ceasefire fo r France , as the Peace of Tilsit 341 had been for Prussia .
And no w began the feveris h arms race betwee n Franc e and Germany, int o which Russia , Austria and Italy were also graduall y drawn.
To start with, the obligator y term of service in the Landwehr wa s extended.
I n Franc e the territoria l army acquire d a reserve of older men ; in German y the second levy of the Landwehr and even the Landsturm were revived.
342 And so it went on, step by step, until the age limit set by nature was reache d and even exceeded .
Then conscriptio n was steppe d up and the new trainin g cadres which thi s made necessar y were set up; but here again the limit has been almos t or fully reached , and in France has even been exceeded.
Th e last enlistmen t intakes of the French army alread y include quit e a number of young men who are not yet—o r not at all—equal t o the hardship s of service .
The Englis h officers , impartial o n this point, who attende d the large manoeuvr e in Champagne i n 1891 and acknowledge d the high efficienc y of the present Frenc h army, generousl y and at times admiringly , report unanimously tha t an excessivel y large numbe r of young soldier s dropped ou t in the course of the marche s and comba t exercises .
In German y we have admittedl y not yet exhauste d our reserve s of men fit for militar y service , but to remed y that is precisel y the purpose o f the new Militar y Bill.
In short, even in this respect we are approachin g the limits of our powers .
Now th e modern , the revolutionary aspec t of the Prussia n military syste m consist s precisel y in the deman d that the strengt h of every able-bodie d man should be placed at the service of national defenc e for as long as he is capable of bearing arms.
And the only revolutionar y thing that can be discerne d in all military development sinc e 1870 is the very fact that it has been deeme d necessary—often enoug h with some reluctance—actuall y to in-creasingly carr y out this demand , which had hithert o only been fulfilled i n chauvinis t fantasy .
Neithe r the term of service liability nor the enlistmen t of all able-bodie d young men can be called into question today , least of all by German y and even less by the Social-Democratic Party , which, quite the contrary , is the only force able to translat e also this deman d fully into practice .
Accordingly ther e remain s only one point where the need for disarmament ca n apply the lever: the term of service with the colours.
An d this, in fact, is the Archimedea n point: international 26-1550 regulation, b y the great powers of the Continent , of the maximum term of active service with the colours fo r all arms of the service , initially fo r two years, as far as I am concerned—bu t with the proviso o f an immediat e furthe r reductio n as soon as people are convinced o f the possibility , and with the militia system as the ultimate objective.
An d I maintai n that German y in particula r is better able to make this proposal , and that German y will profit more than anyone els e by makin g it, even if it is rejected .
II The internationa l regulatio n of the maximu m term of service with the colours would affect the armies of all powers equally .
It is generally assume d that, in armies whose men have never been under fire , for the initial phase of a campaig n the term of active service—within certai n limits—provide s the best measur e of their suitability i n all war situations , particularl y for strategi c and tactica l attack.
Ou r warrior s of 1870 had sufficien t experienc e of the furia francese, o f the bayone t attack of the long-servin g imperia l infantr y and the full force of the cavalry attacks at Worth and Sedan; but at Spichern , right at the beginnin g of the war, they also demonstrated tha t they could expel this same infantr y from a strong position—eve n thoug h outnumbered.
343 Generall y speak-ing, then , let us conced e that within certain limits, which vary with the nationa l character , in troops with no experienc e of war the term of service with the colour s is decisiv e with regard to their general suitabilit y for war and particularl y their fitness for the offensive.
If we succee d in setting a maximu m limit to their term of service internationally , the relativ e capacit y of the variou s armies will remai n roughl y what it is today.
What one forfeit s in immediate potential , the others will also forfeit .
Insofa r as a surprise attac k by one state on anothe r is excluded , it will continu e to be so, to the same extent.
The differenc e in the term of active service betwee n France and Germany , for instance , has up till now not bee n such that it is of any importance ; even under the reduced ter m of service everythin g would depen d on how the agreed ter m of service was used in each of the armies , just as it does today .
Apart from this, the relativ e strengt h of the two armies woul d correspon d to the ratio betwee n the population s of the two countries .
Once universa l compulsor y militar y service is actually introduced , in countrie s of roughl y equal economi c 375 development (whic h determine s the percentag e of the unfit) the population siz e will always be the measur e of the strengt h of the armed forces .
Then there will be no more tricks like the Prussia n tricks of 1813; that crea m will have been skimme d off.
But a great deal is dependen t on how the establishe d term of service i s utilised .
And on this subject there are men in almost all armies wh o could tell a tale or two if they were—permitte d to, for shortage o f money has everywher e forced armie s to give a proportion o f their recruit s a "makeshift " trainin g in a few months.
The n they have to restric t themselve s to essentials , a whole lo t of traditiona l tomfooler y is thrown out of the window , and they find to their surpris e how little time it takes to make a soldier ou t of a tolerabl y well-buil t young man.
Bebel has related in the Reichsta g how this astonishe d the trainin g officer s of the German Ersatzreserve.
344 In the Austria n army there are plenty of officers wh o maintai n that the Landwehr, which ha s about the same term of service as the Germa n Ersatzreserve, is better than the line.
No wonder .
There they lack the time that is wasted in the line on the traditional an d hence sanctifie d idiocies—an d for this very reason it is not wasted .
The Germa n infantr y regulation s of 1888 limit the tactica l formations fo r battle to the essentials .
It contain s nothin g new; fighting abilit y in all reverse d situation s had alread y been introduced b y the Austrian s after 1859; the formatio n of all battalion column s by means of a simple combinatio n of four company column s had been introduce d at about the same time by the Darmhessians , who had to succum b to this rationa l formatio n again bein g prohibite d by the Prussian s after 1866.
345 In other respects th e new regulation s do away with an immens e tangle of antediluvian ceremonie s that were as useles s as they were sancrosanct; leas t of all do I have any reason to find fault with it.
For after the war of 1870 I allowed myself the luxury of drawin g up a plan of the closed formation s and movement s of companie s and battalion s appropriat e to present-da y warfare , and was not a little surprise d to find this piece of the "state of the future " implemented i n almost every particula r in the relevan t section s of the new regulations .
But the regulation s are one thing, and putting them into practic e is another.
Th e martinets , which have always flourishe d in the Prussia n army in times of peace, reintroduc e the time-wastin g abolishe d in the instructions throug h the back door of the parade-ground .
All at once parade dril l is vitally necessar y to counterbalanc e the unrulines s of the disperse d battle order, as the sole means of establish -26* ing true discipline , etc.
, etc.
This is tantamoun t to saying that orde r and disciplin e can only be establishe d by makin g the men practis e utterly useles s things .
The abolitio n of the "goose step " alone would make whole weeks availabl e for rationa l exercises, quit e apart from the fact that foreign officer s could then watc h a Germa n revie w withou t laughin g up their sleeves.
Another simila r obsolet e institutio n is sentry duty, which , according t o an old traditiona l notion, also serves to develo p the intelligence an d especiall y the independen t though t of the men by teaching the m the art—in case they are not already familia r with it—of standin g guard and thinkin g of nothin g at all for two hours.
In view of the presen t universa l custom of practisin g outpost dut y in the field, sentry duty in town, where there are after all security police of every kind, has become totally senseless .
Its abolitio n would result in at least a twenty per cent gain in the effective ter m of service for the army and ensure safety on the streets fo r civilians .
And the n there are everywher e a lot of soldier s who on all sorts of pretext s do as little service as possible : compan y craftsmen , batmen, etc .
There is plenty of scope for change s here.
Yes—but wha t about the cavalry ? Surely they must have a longer ter m of service?—Thi s is certainl y desirabl e if one is dealing wit h recruit s who can neithe r ride nor tend a horse.
But there is plenty of scope for change s here too.
If the horse rations were no t so meagerl y proportioned—th e horse s have to be specially fe d for the manoeuvre s in order to attain their norma l strength!—and i f every squadro n had a number of extra horses available s o that the men were able to practis e in the saddle more often an d for longer periods—i n short, if a serious effort were made to compensat e for the shorte r term of service by the more intensive pursui t of essential s and the eliminatio n of things superfluous, i t would soon be found that it is possibl e to manag e in that way, too.
Even for rough-riding , on which so much stress has been placed and the vital necessit y of which I readily concede , ways an d means can be found.
And anywa y there is nothin g to prevent th e retentio n and extensio n of the system of three or four-year volunteer s or of re-enliste d soldier s for cavalry troops , for as long as it is considere d necessary—i n return for corre-sponding compensation s in the service liability of the reserve and the Landwehr, without whic h such things will not be attained .
Of course , if one listens to the militar y authoritie s one hears quite a differen t tale.
It is all quite impossible , they say, and nothing ma y be altered withou t everythin g collapsing .
But for fifty years no w I have heard so many militar y institution s solemnl y described a s unassailabl e and sacrosanc t today, only to see them flung mercilessl y into the junk room tomorrow , and by the very same authorities ; furthermore , I have so often seen that what is praised t o the skies in one army is deeme d beneat h contemp t in another; I have so often observe d that custom s lavishe d with praise an d institution s of long standin g prove to be folly in the face of the enemy ; finally, it has so often been my experienc e that in every army there is a particula r conventiona l traditio n intende d for those of minor rank, the commo n soldier and the public, that is cultivate d by the higher superior s but ridicule d by the officer s of independen t mind and reduce d to nough t by every campaign — in short, I have had so much historica l experienc e of this that I would advis e everyon e to distrus t nothin g more than militar y "expertise".
Ill It is a peculiar contrast : our high-rankin g soldier s are generall y so dreadfull y conservativ e precisel y in their own field, and yet there is today scarcel y any other domain that is as revolutionar y as the militar y one.
The smooth-bor e six-pounde r and the seven-pound howitze r which I handled close by the Kupfergraben i n the old days 346 and today' s rifled breech-loadin g guns, the large-calibre smooth-bor e gun of those days and the moder n 5mm repeating breech-loaders , seem centurie s apart; and there is still no end to it, every day technolog y still ruthlessl y throws overboar d all the latest innovations .
Now it is even discardin g the romanti c powder-smoke, givin g battle a totally differen t characte r and course tha t are quite incalculabl e in advance .
We must, however , increasingly com e to terms with such incalculabl e factors in the midst of this ceaseles s revolutionisin g of the technica l basis of warfare.
As late as forty years ago the effectiv e firing range of the infantry extende d no furthe r than 300 paces, at which distanc e a single ma n could surviv e unscathe d a volley from an entire battalion, provide d that the men were all really aiming at him.
As for the firing range of the field artillery , it was practicall y ineffectual eve n at 1,500 to 1,800 paces.
In the Franco-Prussia n War the effectiv e firing range of the rifles was 600-1,00 0 paces, that of the artiller y 3,000-4,00 0 paces at the most.
But the new small-bore rifles , as yet untried in war, have a range approachin g that of the artillery , their projectile s have four to six times the penetration; th e repeatin g rifle gives a section today the same firepower tha t a whole compan y used to have; the artillery , while it cannot boast of a similar increas e in firing range, has loaded its shells wit h entirel y new explosive s of previousl y unheard-o f effect; though admittedl y it is not yet quite certain who will have to suffer this effect , the shoote r or the shot-at .
And in the midst of this unceasing , ever acceleratin g revolution -isation o f the whole militar y system we are faced with militar y authorities wh o five years ago were still drummin g into their troops al l the conventiona l ceremonie s and artificia l contortion s of old Fritz's 2 linear tactics, which vanishe d from the battlefiel d long ago, and continue d to revere regulation s by which you could still be beate n becaus e you had marche d off to the right and there was no room to form up on the left! Authoritie s who to this very day dare no t questio n the shiny button s and metal fittings of the soldiers' equipment—jus t as many magnet s to attrac t 5mm bullets—who sen d the Uhlans into action with broad red doublets , and the cuirassier s admittedl y withou t cuirasses—a t last!—bu t in white battledress , and have only decide d after much heart -searching t o sacrific e on the altar of the fatherlan d the epaulette s (which wer e all the more sacred for being in such appallin g taste)—rather tha n the epaulette-beare r himself .
It seems to me that it is neither in the interes t of the Germa n people, no r of the Germa n army that this conservativ e superstitio n remains i n contro l of the army amids t the technica l revolutio n surging al l around it.
We need fresher , bolder minds, and I would be very much mistake n if there were not plenty of these among our mos t capable officers , plenty longin g to be liberate d from the routine an d the pedantr y which has again run riot in the last twenty years of peace.
But until they find the courag e and the opportunit y to assert their convictions , the rest of us will have to step into the breach an d do our best to prove that we too learnt somethin g in the army.
Furthermore I have attempte d to demonstrat e above that the two-year ter m of service can be put into practic e now in all arms of the service if the men are taught what they need to know in war and are spared the traditiona l time-consumin g antiquities .
But I stated right from the outset that it should not stop at two years.
Rather, th e proposa l for an internationa l two-yea r term of service a Frederic k II.
— Ed.
should b e seen as simply the first step toward s a gradual furthe r reduction i n the term of service—say , eightee n month s to begin with, tw o summer s and a winter—the n a year—then.
.
.
? This is where th e state of the future starts, the unadulterate d militia system, an d we shall return to this once the thing has really been set in motion .
And this , setting the thing in motion , is most importan t of all.
If one first faces the fact that the reductio n of the term of service is a necessit y for the economi c existenc e of all countrie s and for the preservation o f Europea n peace, the next gain to be made is the realisation tha t the stress in military training should be placed on the education of youth.
When I returne d to the Rhine after ten years' exile, 347 I was pleasantly surprise d to see paralle l and horizonta l bars set up everywhere i n the yards of the village schools .
So far, so good: unfortunately i t did not go very far.
The apparatu s was acquire d in accordanc e with instructions , in the good old Prussia n manner , but whe n it came to using it there was always some sort of obstacle.
Tha t was a differen t kettle of fish entirely—i n fact, it usually neve r came to it at all.
Is it too much to ask that the whole business shoul d be taken seriousl y at last? That school pupils of all classes shoul d be taugh t gymnastic s both with and withou t apparatus systematicall y and thoroughl y while their limbs are still elastic an d supple , instead of, as now, making twenty-year-ol d lads slave awa y in vain in the sweat of their brows—an d one's own—i n order to make their stiffene d bones , muscle s and ligament s loose and plian t once again? Any doctor will tell you that the divisio n of labour deform s any human being subjecte d to it, whole series of muscles bein g develope d at the expens e of others , and that the effects o f this vary accordin g to the specific branch of labour, each job producin g its own deformity .
Is it not then madnes s first to let the men becom e deforme d and then afterward s make them straight an d mobile again in the army? Does it deman d a degree of insigh t surpassin g the official horizon to see that one will obtain soldiers tha t are three times as good if one guards agains t this deformation a t the appropriat e time, at elementar y school and secondary college ? But this is only the beginning .
A boy can be taugh t the formation an d movemen t of a serried troop at school with ease.
The schoolbo y stands and walks straigh t by nature , particularl y when he has physica l training ; during our militar y service every one of us has observe d the way our recruit s stand and how hard it is to teach many of them to walk and stand straight .
The movements i n colum n and compan y can be trained at any school and with a facility unknow n in the army.
What is a detested , often almost insurmountabl e difficult y for the recruit is a game and a diversion fo r the schoolboy .
The contac t and sense of directio n in frontal marchin g and wheelin g which is so difficul t to attain with adult recruit s is easily learnt by schoolboy s as soon as drill is systematically carrie d out with them.
If a good part of the summe r is devote d to marche s and exercise s in the field, the minds and bodies o f the boys will derive no less benefit from it than the military coffers , which will thus save whole month s of service time.
Military ramble s of this kind are particularl y well suited for getting the boys to solve such problem s as are encountere d on active service, an d this in turn is highly apt to develo p the pupils ' intelligence an d enabl e them to acquir e a specificall y militar y training i n a comparativel y short time.
The practica l proof of this has been provide d by my old friend Beust , himsel f a former Prussian officer , at his school in Zurich .
With the presen t complicated stat e of militar y matters , a transitio n to the militia system i s inconceivabl e withou t preparator y militar y trainin g for young people , and it is precisel y in this field that Beust's successfu l experiments ar e of the greates t importance .
And now permi t me to strike a specificall y Prussia n note.
The vital questio n of concer n to the Prussia n state is: what is to becom e of the non-commissione d officer who has served his time? Until now he has been used as a policeman , frontier guard, doorkeeper , clerk, as a civil servant of every conceivabl e kind; there is not a single slo t in the Prussia n bureaucracy , howeve r humble , that has not been filled with non-commissione d officer s with a claim to a government appointment .
Well then: you have worke d your fingers t o the bone to find situation s for the non-commissione d officers; yo u have insisted on thrustin g them in where they are no good, an d using them for things of which they know nothing ; is it not abou t time they were found a place in the field with which they are familia r and in which they can perfor m a useful job? They shoul d becom e schoolmasters , but not in reading , writing and arithmetic—le t them teach gymnastic s and drill.
That will do them an d the boys good.
And once the non-commissione d officer s are transferre d from the secrec y of the barrack s and militar y jurisdiction int o the dayligh t of the schoolyar d and civil crimina l procedure, I bet our rebelliou s school pupils will soon teach even the wors t parade-groun d despo t good manners .
IV We reserv e the right to return to the questio n of whethe r such a proposal fo r a universal , equal and gradua l reductio n in the term of servic e has any prospec t of being adopte d by internationa l treaty.
Fo r the time being let us procee d from the assumptio n that it has been adopted .
Will it then be translate d from paper into reality, wil l it be honestl y carried out by all parties ? Certainly, i n the main.
Firstly, it will not be possibl e to keep secret a way of evadin g it that is in any respec t worth the trouble .
And secondly , the populatio n itself will ensur e that it is implemented.
N o one remain s in the barrack s of his own free will if he is kept there beyon d the period prescribe d by law.
As far as individua l countrie s are concerned , Austria and Italy, as well as the second and third-ran k states that have introduce d universal militar y service , will welcom e such a treaty as an act of liberation an d will happily adhere to it in every detail.
We shall discuss Russi a in the next section .
But what about France ? And in this matte r France is quite definitel y the decisiv e country .
Once Franc e has signed and ratified the treaty there can be no doubt tha t it will have, by and large, to keep to it.
But let us admit that the revanchis t tendenc y existin g in the propertie d classes and the part of the workin g class that is not yet socialis t may win the upper han d for a momen t and provok e infringement s of the treaty limits , either direct or based on hair-splitting .
Such infringements can , however , never be of any importance , for otherwise Pari s would prefer to abrogat e the treaty.
But German y is in the fortunat e positio n of being able generousl y to turn a blind ey e to such minor cheating .
Despite all the very commend -able effort s of France to render a repetitio n of the defeats of 1870 impossible, German y is much furthe r ahead of it than is evident at first glance .
Firstly there is the annuall y growin g gap betwee n the populations, no w amountin g to more than 12 million in Ger-many's favour .
Secondly , the fact that the presen t military system has been in existenc e in Prussia for more than sevent y years; the population ha s grown accustome d to it; it has been tested in every detail in a long series of mobilisations ; all the problem s that may arise an d the mode of solving them have been experience d in practice an d are familiar—advantage s from whic h the other German armie s also benefit .
In France , however , general mobilisa -tion still has to be tried out, and with an organisatio n that, for this purpose, i s much more complicated .
Thirdly , however , the undemocratic institutio n of one-yea r volunteer s has encountere d insuperable obstacle s in France ; the three-yea r soldier s have simply ouste d the one-yea r privilege d ones from the army by means o f chicanery .
This proves how far public politica l conscious -ness in Germany , and the politica l institution s tolerate d by it, lag behind thos e of France .
But the politica l shortcomin g is in this case a military advantage .
It is beyond all doubt that no country , in relatio n to its population , sends such a number of young people through it s secondar y and high school s as Germany , and so the institution o f one-yea r volunteers , undemocrati c and politicall y objectionable thoug h it may be, provide s the army comman d with an excellen t means of giving the majorit y of these young people (who hav e alread y receive d an adequat e all-roun d training ) a military trainin g for service as officers .
The campaig n of 1866 first illustrated this , but since then, and particularl y since 1871, this aspect of Germany' s militar y strengt h has been speciall y fostered , indeed almos t to excess .
And even if so many of the Germa n reserve officer s have recentl y been doing their best to make their rank a laughin g stock, there is still no doubt that as a body they are militaril y superior , man for man, to their French counterparts , and, mos t importantly , that among its reservist s and territorial s Germany possesse s a much higher percentag e of men qualifie d for service a s officers than any other country .
This peculia r abundanc e of officers enable s German y to muster a disproportionatel y larger numbe r of new formations , alread y trained i n peacetime , than any other country .
Accordin g to the claim mad e by Richter (Freisinnige Zeitung, November 26 , 1892 348), which a s far as I know has not been refute d either in the Reichstag o r in the military commission , each Germa n infantr y regi-ment wil l be able to provid e a mobile reserve regiment , two batta-lions of Landwehr and two Ersatzreserve battalions fo r action in war.
Thus ever y three battalion s provid e ten, or the 519 battalion s of the 173 peacetim e regiment s turn into 1,730 battalion s in war-time, not countin g rifleme n and gunners .
And in such a short time that no other countr y is able to come even remotel y near it.
The Frenc h reserv e officers , as one of them admitte d to me, are much les s numerous ; yet they are suppose d to be sufficien t to fill the posts of the new formation s envisage d by official publications .
What is more, this man confesse d that half of these officer s are not of much use.
The new formation s in questio n are, however , a long way from equallin g what German y is said to be capabl e of achieving.
An d even so, the officer s that France is able to muster will by then all have been used, while German y will still be keepin g some of them in reserve .
Can Europ e Disarm ? 383 In all wars hithert o there has been a lack of officer s after a couple o f month s of campaigning .
With all other countrie s this would stil l be the case even today .
German y alone has an inexhaustible suppl y of officers .
This being so, should we not be able to turn a blind eye to it if the French occasionall y drill their men two or three weeks longer than stipulate d in the treaty? V We now come to Russia .
Frankl y speaking , it makes little difference whethe r Russia adhere s to a treaty on the gradua l equal reduction o f the term of service , or even enters into one at all.
In fact, as far as the issue at hand is concerned , we can disregar d Russia almos t entirely , for reason s given below.
Although th e Russia n Empir e embrace s over a hundre d million people, easil y twice as many as the Germa n Empire , it is far from possessing a n offensiv e militar y force anywher e near that of Germany.
Th e fifty millio n peopl e of German y are huddle d together ove r an area of 540,00 0 square kilometres ; the at most 90 to 100 million people in Russia that come into consideratio n for us militarily ar e disperse d over 3V2 million square kilometres , at a moderate estimate ; the advantag e accruin g to the German s on account o f this far greater density of populatio n is enhance d even further b y the incomparabl y better railway network .
In spite of this, the fact remain s that a hundre d million can in the long run provide mor e soldier s than fifty.
As things stand it will take quite a long tim e before they come ; but they are bound to come eventually.
Wha t then? An army needs not only recruit s but also officers .
And in this respect th e positio n in Russia looks pretty bad.
In Russia only the nobility an d the citizenr y of the towns are considere d for the rank of officer .
The nobilit y is comparativel y very small in numbers ; there are few towns—on e man in ten at most lives in a town—an d of these towns only very few indeed merit the name.
The numbe r of secondar y school s and of the pupils attendin g them is exceedingly small .
Where are the officers for all the rank-and-fil e troops suppose d to come from? One man' s meat is anothe r man's poison .
The system of universal militar y servic e presuppose s a certain degre e of economic an d intellectua l development ; where this is lacking the system doe s more harm than good.
And this is obviousl y the case in Russia .
First, it takes a comparativel y long time anywa y to make a trained soldie r out of the averag e Russia n recruit .
The Russia n soldier i s of unquestionabl e bravery .
As long as the attack by serried rank s of infantr y was tacticall y decisive , he was in his element.
Hi s entire experienc e of life had led him to rely on the union wit h his comrades .
In the villages , the semi-communisti c community, i n the towns , the cooperativ e work of the artel, 349 everywhere th e krugovaya poruka? th e mutua l liabilit y of the comrades; i n short, a state of society that palpabl y points to cohesion, th e fount of all salvation , on the one hand, and the powerless solitud e of the isolate d individua l left to his own initiative, o n the other.
The Russia n retains this characte r even in the army ; the massed battalion s are almost impossibl e to break up, the greate r the danger , the harder the lumps cluster together .
But this instinc t to close ranks, which was still of inestimabl e value at the time of the Napoleoni c campaign s and compensate d for a good man y less useful aspects of the Russia n soldier , is today a definite danger .
Today the masses in closed ranks have disap-peared fro m the battle-line , today it is a matter of holdin g together disperse d bands of infantrymen , in which troops from the most diverse units are all mixed up and comman d often and rapidly enoug h switche s to officer s who are completel y unknow n to most of the men; today every soldier must be able to do what has to be done at any particula r momen t on his own, though without losin g his sense of belongin g to the whole.
This sense of cohesion canno t be facilitate d throug h the primitiv e herd instinc t of the Russia n but only by developin g the intelligenc e of each individual.
Th e essentia l condition s for this can only be found at a stage of civilisatio n marke d by higher "individualistic " develop -ment, suc h as that existin g in the capitalis t nations of the West.
The small-bor e repeatin g breech-loade r and low-smok e powde r have transforme d the quality which was hithert o the greates t strength o f the Russia n army into one of its greates t weaknesses .
Thus nowaday s it will take even longer than before to make the Russian recrui t into a soldier fit for battle, and he will no longer be able to match the soldier s of the West at all.
But secondly : where are the officer s to come from to give all these ne w formation s a framewor k in wartime ? If even France is having troubl e findin g a sufficien t numbe r of officers , how will Russia manage ? Russia , where the educate d population , which alone ca n supply competen t officers , constitute s such a dispropor -a Engels' transliteration o f the Russia n words.
— Ed.
385 tionately smal l percentag e of the total, and yet the soldiers , even the traine d soldiers , need a larger percentag e of officers than in other armies ? And thirdly : with the notorious , widesprea d system of embezzle -ment an d theft on the part of the civil servant s in Russia , and all too often the officer s too, how is a mobilisatio n suppose d to take place? In all previou s Russia n wars it immediatel y turned out that even par t of the peacetim e army and its stocks of equipmen t existed onl y on paper .
How will they manage , then, when the reservists o n leave and the opoltschenie* (Landwehr) are to join their unit s and be equippe d with uniforms , arms and ammunition ? Unless everythin g goes off smoothl y during mobilisation , unless everything i s availabl e at the right time and in the right place, there is utter confusion .
But how is everythin g to go off smoothl y if everythin g passe s throug h the hands of thieving , corrup t Russian tschinowniks h ? The Russia n mobilisation—tha t will be a show fit for the Gods! All thing s considered : for purely militar y reason s alone, we can allow th e Russian s to call up as many soldier s and to keep them with the colours as long as the Tsar sees fit.
Apart from the troops who are alread y under arms he will hardly be able to put many more on their feet, and hardly at the right time.
The experimen t with universa l militar y service may cost Russia dear.
And then , if it comes to war, all along the border from Kovn o to Kaminiet s the Russia n army will be in enemy countr y right there o n her own soil, amidst Poles and Jews, the Tsaris t government eve n having made mortal enemie s of the Jews.
The moment Russi a loses a couple of battles the battlefiel d will be pushed bac k from the Vistula to the Dvina and the Dnieper ; in the rear of the Germa n army, under its protection , an army of Polish allie s will be formed ; and it will be a just punishmen t for Prussia i f it is then compelle d to restore a strong Poland to ensure its own safety .
Up to now we have only considere d the directl y militar y conditions, findin g that Russia can be disregarde d as far as the present issu e is concerned .
This will become even more evident , however, a s soon as we cast a glance at the overal l economi c situation, an d particularl y the financia l position , in Russia .

VI The interna l situation i n Russia is almost desperat e at the moment.
Th e emancipatio n of the serfs in 1861 and the development o f large-scal e capitalis t industr y related to it, partly as cause, partl y as effect, have hurled this, the stables t of all countries, this European China, int o an economi c and social revolution whic h is now proceedin g inexorabl y on its way; and its progress is , for the time being, overwhelmingl y devastating .
At the time of the emancipation , the nobility receive d compensa -tion in state loan bonds , which they spent in revelry as fast as they could .
When this was accomplished , the new railway s opened up a market for the wood from their forest for them; they had the timber cu t and sold and once again lived in splendou r and pleasure a s long as the proceed s lasted.
The managemen t of the estates unde r the new condition s and with free worker s generall y remained mos t unsatisfactory ; little wonde r that the landownin g Russian nobilit y are up to their ears in debt, if not utterly bankrupt, an d that the produc e yielde d by their estate s is decreasing rathe r than increasing .
The peasan t generall y receive d worse land, and less of it, than he had owned until then; he lost the right to commo n grazin g and the use of the forest, and hence the basis for rearing livestock .
Taxes wer e raised considerably , and now had to be paid by him personally i n cash, everywhere ; on top of this there were the instalments—also i n cash—t o pay off the interes t and capital on the redemptio n money advance d by the state (wykup)a.
I n short, the deterioratio n of his overall economi c positio n was aggravate d by his suddenl y being forcibl y remove d from a subsistenc e farming econom y and being placed in a money economy , which is alone enoug h to ruin the peasantr y of a country .
The result of this was the luxurian t developmen t of the exploitatio n of the peasant s by the rural money-owners , well-to-d o farmer s and pot-hous e landlords, mirojedy (literall y "communit y eaters" ) and kulakia (usurers).
An d as if that were not enough , along came moder n large-scale industr y and ruined the subsistenc e econom y of the peasants t o the very last bit.
Not only did its competitio n undermine th e domesti c industria l productio n of the peasan t for his own wants, it also took away the marke t for his handicraft s intended fo r sale, or placed it, at best, under the sway of the capitalist "entrepreneur " or, even worse , his middleman .
The a Engels' transliteration o f the Russia n words.

Russian peasant , with his primeva l agricultur e and his old communistic communit y system , was thus suddenl y brough t into collision wit h the most advance d form of moder n large-scal e industry, whic h had to forcibl y acquir e a domesti c market ; a situation i n which he was irredeemabl y bound to perish .
But the peasant comprise d almost nine-tenth s of the populatio n of Russia , and the ruin of the peasan t was synonymou s with the—a t least temporary—ruin o f Russia.
* After thi s proces s of social upheava l had been going on for abou t twenty years, other results emerge d too.
The ruthles s deforestation destroye d the stocks of subsoil water, the rain and snow wate r flowed quickl y away along the stream s and rivers without bein g absorbed , producin g seriou s floods; but in summe r the river s becam e shallow and the ground dried out.
In many of the most fertile areas of Russia the level of subsoil water is said to have droppe d a full metre, so that the roots of the corn crops can no longe r reach it and wither away.
So that not only are the human being s ruined , but in many areas so is the land itself for at least a generation .
This hithert o chroni c proces s of ruinatio n was rendere d acute and thus visible to the whole world by the famine of 1891.
And for this reason Russia has not manage d to escape from famin e since 1891 .
That bad year largely ruined the peasants ' last and most importan t means of production—livestock—an d drove their indebtedness t o such height s that it is bound to crush their last powers o f resistance .
In a position like this a country could do no more than embar k on a war of desperation .
But even the means for this are lacking .
In Russi a the nobility lives on debts, the peasan t now also lives on debts, and the state, especially , lives on debts.
The amoun t of money owe d by the Russia n state abroad is known : over four thousand millio n marks.
The amoun t it owes at home is known to no one; firstly, becaus e neithe r the total of the loans raised nor that of the paper-mone y in circulatio n is known and, secondly , because th e value of this paper-mone y change s every day.
But one thing is certain : Russia' s credit abroad is exhausted .
The four thousand millio n marks of the Russia n nationa l debt bonds have glutted th e Wester n Europea n money marke t to burstin g point.

England go t rid of most of her "Russians " long ago, and German y has recentl y done so.
Hollan d and Franc e have ruined their digestion b y purchasin g them, as was evident from the last Russian loan in Paris: only 300 of the 500 million francs could be placed , and the Russia n ministe r of finance had to take back 200 million from the subscribin g and oversubscribin g bankers.
350 This consti-tutes proo f of the fact that there is no prospec t whateve r of a new Russian loa n in the immediat e future , not even in France .
This is the positio n of the countr y which is said to be threatening u s with the imminen t risk of war and yet is even unable t o get a war of desperatio n off the ground unless we are stupid enoug h to toss the money for it into its jaws ourselves .
The ignoranc e of the Frenc h governmen t and the Frenc h bourgeois publi c opinio n that control s it is incomprehensible .
It is not Franc e that needs Russia—rathe r it is Russia that needs France.
Withou t France , the Tsar and his policy would be isolated in Europe ; powerles s he would have to let everythin g in the West and the Balkan s take its course.
With a little commo n sense France could squeez e as much out of Russia as it wanted to.
But instead , the Frenc h authoritie s are grovellin g prostrat e before the Tsar.
Russia's whea t export s have alread y been ruined by cheape r American competition .
This leaves only rye as its chief export commodity, an d this goes almost exclusivel y to Germany .
The moment Germany starts eating white bread instead of black bread, the present, official Tsarist-big-bourgeois Russia will go bankrupt.
VII We hav e now sufficientl y criticise d our neighbouring , placid enemies.
Bu t what are things like at home? Well, to put it bluntly: a gradual reductio n in the term of service can only be to the advantag e of the army if an end is put once and for all to maltreatment o f soldier s which has gained ground in recent year s and becom e the rule in the army, far more than people car e to admit.
This maltreatmen t is the counterpar t of square-bashin g and parade drill ; both have always spread in the Prussia n army as soon as it become s a peacetim e army for a while, and from the Prussians i t is passed on to the Saxons , Bavarians , etc.
It is a legacy from the genuin e "Old Prussian " age, when the soldier was either an enliste d ragamuffi n or the son of a bond peasant , and therefore ha d to put up with every form of ill-treatmen t and 389 degradation fro m his Junke r officer withou t a murmur .
And particularly th e down-at-hee l nobility of starveling s and spongers , which is by no means under-represente d east of the Elbe, still provides it s share of the worst tormentor s even today, and is only equalled i n this respec t by the snobbis h little sons of the bourgeoisie eage r to play the Junker .
The browbeatin g of the soldier has never entirel y died out in the Prussia n army.
But it used to be rarer, more lenien t and at times mor e humorous .
But then, on the one hand, it became necessary t o teach the soldier more and more, while, on the other hand, nobod y though t of abolishin g the useles s debris of outmoded tactica l drills, which had becom e meaningless .
From this time on, the non-commissione d officer increasingl y receive d tacit authorisation t o adopt any metho d of trainin g which he deeme d suitable.
Furthermor e he was indirectl y constraine d to emplo y forcible mean s by the order to drum one thing or anothe r into his squad wit h a satisfactor y result in a limited period .
On top of all this, the soldier' s right of complain t is a downrigh t mockery—n o wonder th e favourit e Old Prussia n metho d came into vogue again wherever th e soldier s put up with it.
For I am certain that there is much les s tormentin g of soldier s in the regiment s of the West or those wit h a strong admixtur e of city-dweller s than in those which are chiefl y made up of countr y people from east of the Elbe.
There use d to be a means of counterbalancin g this, at least in practice.
Wit h the smooth-bor e muzzle-loade r it was a simple matter t o drop a pebble down the barrel onto the blank cartridg e during manoeuvres , and it was by no means unusua l for hated superiors t o be accidentall y shot during manoeuvres .
Sometime s it went wron g as well: I knew a young man from Cologn e who was killed in this way in 1849, by a shot that was intende d for his captain.
Now , with the small-bor e breech-loade r it is no longer possible t o do this so easily and unobtrusively ; for this reason , the army suicid e statistic s indicat e to us the barometri c level of soldier tormenting fairl y accurately .
But if the live cartridg e is put to use in "seriou s cases" , there is certainl y every reason to wonde r whether th e old practic e is again finding its advocates , as is said to have happene d here and there in recent wars; though of course that woul d not contribut e much to victory.
351 The report s of English officer s are unanimou s in praisin g the exceptionally goo d relation s betwee n superior s and soldier s in the French arm y on manoeuvre s in Champagn e in 1891.
Such things as so often leak out of the barrack s and into the press in our country woul d be quite impossibl e in this army.
Even before the 27-1550 Great Revolutio n the attemp t to introduc e Prussia n floggin g with rods failed .
Even at the worst momen t of the Algeria n campaign s and the Second Empire , no superio r would have dared treat the French soldier s anythin g like as badly as the Germa n soldie r is treated befor e our very eyes.
And today, after the introductio n of universal compulsor y militar y service , I should like to see the French non-commissione d officer who would ventur e to order the soldiers t o box each other's ears or spit in each other's faces.
But what scor n the Frenc h soldier s must feel for their future adversaries whe n they hear and read what they submit to withou t turning a hair.
And every care is taken to ensure that the men in French barrack s do read and hear all about it.
In the French army there prevail s the spirit and relationshi p between officers , non-commissione d officer s and soldier s that prevailed i n Prussi a from 1813 to 1815, and twice took our soldiers t o Paris.
In our own country , however , the state of affairs is fast approachin g that of 1806, when the soldier was hardly even considered a human being, and was flogged and tormented , when there wa s an unbridgeabl e gulf betwee n him and the officer—an d this stat e of affairs led the army to Jena 352 and into Frenc h captivity.
There is a lot of talk about the decisiv e value of morale in war.
Yet wha t else is done in peacetim e but to destro y it almost systematically? VIII So far we have assume d that the proposa l for a gradual , equal reduction i n the term of service with an ultimat e transitio n to the militia syste m has been universall y adopted .
But the main questio n is: will it be adopted ? Let us assume that German y first puts the proposa l to Austria , Italy and France .
Austria will gladly accept a maximu m term of service o f two years and will probabl y reduce it even furthe r in actual practice .
In the Austria n army it seems that there is far less reticence tha n in the Germa n army to talk about the fact that the short ter m of service of some troops has been a success.
Many officers ther e state quite bluntly that the Landwehr, which onl y serves fo r a few months , is a better troop than the line; one thing in their favour , at any rate, I am assured , is that a Landwehr battalion ca n mobilis e in 24 hours, while a battalio n of the line requires severa l days.
Naturally : in the line they are afraid to infringe o n the casual old Austria n arrogance ; in the Landwehr, where al l the institution s are newly created , they have, however , had the guts not to introduc e it.
At any rate, both the people and the governmen t of Austri a are longin g for an alleviatio n of the military burden , which is most easily obtainabl e here by reducin g the term of service , precisel y on accoun t of their own experience .
Italy wil l likewis e grasp the opportunit y with both hands .
It is succumbing unde r the pressur e of the militar y budge t to such a degree tha t the help must be brough t in, and soon.
Here, too, reduction o f the maximu m term of service is the shortes t and easiest way .
One may thus say: either the Triple Alliance 353 will come to grief or it will have to adopt a method that is more or less tantamount t o our proposal .
But if Germany , supporte d by the acceptanc e of Austri a and Italy, put s this proposa l to the French government , the latter will be place d in a very awkwar d position .
If it accepts the proposal , it will certainl y not be making its relative militar y positio n any worse.
On the contrary , it would have the opportunit y of improvin g this relative position .
In some respect s it is a disadvantag e for France that universa l compulsor y militar y servic e was only introduce d there 20 years ago.
But this disadvantag e entails the advantag e that everythin g is still new, that the pigtail of yore has only recently bee n choppe d off, that further improvement s can easily be introduce d withou t coming up agains t the stubbor n resistanc e of ingraine d prejudices .
All armies are immensel y capabl e of development afte r major defeats.
Bette r utilisatio n of the term of service lai d down by treaty would therefor e be far easier to put into effec t in Franc e than elsewhere .
Moreover , since the educational syste m is also in a state of revolutionisation , just like the army , it will be possibl e to put the all-roun d physica l (and particularly th e military ) trainin g of young people into operatio n far more rapidly and more easily there than elsewhere .
But this would mea n a strengthenin g in the militar y positio n of France vis-à-vis that of Germany .
In spite of all this, it is possibl e and indeed eve n probabl e that the chauvinis t tendency—Frenc h chauvinism i s just as stupid as the Germa n variety—wil l be strong enough t o bring down any governmen t that adopts any such thing, particularl y if it hails from Germany .
So let us assume that France refuses .
What then? Then, by the simple fact of having made this proposal , German y will have gained a tremendou s advantage .
We should not forget: the twenty-seve n years of Bismarckia n rule have made German y hated in all countries—no t withou t justification .
Neithe r the 27* annexation o f the North Schleswig Danes, no r the breakin g and subsequent jugglin g away of the Pragu e Peace Treaty article relating t o it,354 nor the annexatio n of Alsace-Lorraine , nor the petty-minded measure s against the Prussia n Poles, had anythin g at all to do with restoratio n of the "nationa l unity".
Bismarc k has managed t o give German y the reputatio n of being greedy for territory; th e chauvinis t Germa n burghe r who threw out the German Austrian s and yet still desires to hold German y fraternall y together abov e everythin g "from the Etsch t o the Memel", a but would lik e to unite Holland , Flanders , Switzerlan d and the allegedly "German " Baltic province s of Russia with the Germa n Empire—this Germa n chauvinis t has given Bismarc k every possi-ble assistance , and with such splendi d succes s that not a single person i n Europ e trusts the "hones t Germans " any more .
Wherever yo u care to go, you will find everywher e sympath y for France an d distrus t of Germany , which is regarde d as the cause of the presen t war danger .
There would be an end to all this if Germany decide d to put forwar d our proposal .
It would be acting as a peacemake r in a manne r that left no room for doubt.
It would b e declarin g its willingnes s to lead the way in the work of disarmament, a s rightly befits the countr y that gave the signal for armament.
Distrus t would turn into trust, aversio n into sympathy .
Not only would the saying that the Triple Allianc e is an allianc e for peac e finally becom e a reality—s o would the Triple Allianc e itself, which at presen t is a mere pretence .
All public opinio n in Europe an d Americ a would take sides with Germany .
And that would be a moral conques t which would amply outweig h even any military disadvantage s in our proposa l that could possibl y be thought out .
France, o n the other hand, having turned down the disarma -ment proposal , would slip into the same unfavourabl e positio n of suspicion no w occupie d by Germany .
Now we all see, the European philistin e would say—an d it is he who is the greates t great power—no w we all see who wants peace and who wants war.
And if a really warlik e governmen t should one day take the helm in France , it would be faced with a situation that with a little sense would positivel y prohibi t war.
No matter how it went about it, it would stan d before the whole of Europ e as the party that had precipitated, indee d generate d the war.
Thus it would not only have prejudice d the small countrie s against it, and Englan d too; it would no t even be sure of the aid of Russia , not even the a A paraphras e of Lied der Deutschen by Hoffman n von Fallersleben.
— Ed.
393 traditional Russia n aid that consist s of first getting its allies into trouble an d then leavin g them in the lurch.
Let us not forget: the next war will be decided by England.
Th e Triple Allianc e at war with Russia and France , as well as France , separated fro m Russi a by enemy territory , are all dependen t on sea transpor t for the large grain import s which are indispensabl e to them.
Englan d is absolut e master of the sea.
If it places its navy at the disposa l of one side, the other will simply be starved into submission, it s grain supplie s being cut off; it will be the starvatio n of Paris 355 on an immensel y larger scale, and the side that is starved ou t will have to surrender , as sure as two and two are four.
All righ t then: at the momen t the Libera l tendenc y has the upper han d in England , and the Englis h Liberal s have distinc t French sympathies .
Moreover , old Gladston e is personall y a Russophile.
I f a Europea n war breaks out, Englan d will remain neutral a s long as possible ; but in the above-mentione d cir-cumstances eve n her "benevolent " neutralit y may be of decisiv e help to one of the warrin g parties .
If German y puts forwar d our proposal an d it is rejecte d by France , German y will not only have overcome al l English sympathie s oppose d to it, and assure d itself of England' s benevolen t neutrality ; it will also have made it virtually impossibl e for the English governmen t to join the war on the side of Germany' s opponents .
So, in conclusion : Either Franc e accepts the proposal .
Then the risk of war arising out of ever-increasin g armament s will really have been removed , the people s will come to rest and German y will enjoy the glory for having initiate d this.
Or Franc e does not accept.
It will then make its own positio n in Europe wors e and Germany' s better , to such an exten t that Germany wil l no longer need to fear a war at all and will even be able to procee d to graduall y reduce the term of service and pave the way for the militia system off its own bat and free of danger in collaboration wit h its allies, who will only then truly be its allies.
Will it have the courag e to take the step toward s deliverance ? Or will it wait until France , enlightene d as to the positio n of Russia , takes the first step and reaps the credit for itself? [TO TH E GERMA N WORKER S ON MAY DAY 1893] What bette r can I tell the Germa n worker s today than about the coming Ma y Day celebratio n here in England , which, particularl y this year , will be of special importance.
3 If German y now is no longer Heinrich Heine's "piou s nursery", b then Englan d of today is no longe r the mode l countr y of the Germa n academi c tender-hearts, th e countr y where worthy TRADE S UNION S and prog-ress withi n the law ensure that the bogus dreams of socialis m find no soil.

[TO TH E AUSTRIA N WORKER S ON MA Y DAY 1893] 358 London.
I have been asked to addres s a few words to the Austrian comrade s in their May Day newspaper .
What can I say to them? The y know bette r than I how May Day shoul d be celebrated.
Fro m 1890 onward s the Austria n worker s have shown their brother s in all other countries , year after year, what a real May Day is in the sense of the proletariat .
Nowher e else has it been possibl e to do the same, or even imitate them.
Indeed th e festival of May Day has a far greater importanc e in Austria tha n elsewhere .
In German y in 1890 they could point to the Reichsta g election , just concluded , which had provide d such a grandiose revie w of the militan t Germa n workin g class that any May festiva l appeare d pale in comparison .
In France in 1892 the municipal election s on the basis of genera l suffrage , which similarly brough t great victorie s to the workers , fell on May the First359; there it was necessar y to work for the cause of the proletariat o n May the First, not to celebrate .
But in Austri a the workers hav e not yet got the vote, and the state of press freedo m as well as their right of coalitio n and right of assembl y was defined by Governmen t Counsello r Baron von Czapk a in his answer to questions i n the Reichs Council.
360 And for this reason the Austria n workers ar e right and right again when they insist, under all circumstances, upo n their rigorousl y execute d May Day celebra -tion.
For the worker s of other countrie s this celebratio n is mainly an internationa l affair; it can therefor e come to pass that it takes second plac e to special domesti c circumstances .
For the Austrian s it is not only an internationa l affair but also, and perhap s predominantly, a domesti c affair, and thus stands for them, unconditionally an d always , in the first place.
May it this year too pass off as brilliantl y as ever.

Borrosch complaine d a great deal about the nationa l strife in Bohemia, an d the alleged fanatica l enmity of the Czechs toward s the Bohemia n Germans .
Marx asked him how things were with the Bohemia n workers .
"Yes," replied Borrosch , "that is quite a different matter ; as soon as the worker s join the movement , that comes to an end; there is no more talk of Czechs or Germans , they all stand together.
" What th e Bohemia n worker s of both nationalitie s only sensed [a t that time ] they now know: tha t all nationa l strife is only possibl e under th e rule of the big landed feudal lords and capitalists ; that it serves solely to perpetuat e this rule; that Czech and Germa n workers hav e the same commo n interest s and that as soon as the working clas s attains politica l power all causes for nationa l strife will be removed .
For the workin g class is internationa l by its very nature, an d it will demonstrat e this once again on the coming First of May.

Of the major Europea n countrie s it is only Austria that seems to wish to keep the demonstratio n in the foreground .
Indeed , there the worker s have no other scope for action.
Certainly i n France , very likely in German y and possibl y in England, thi s year will see the importanc e of May Day eclipse d by general elections , in which the proletaria t will be called upon to conquer ne w position s and, withou t any doubt, it will do so.

[TO TH E SPANIS H WORKER S ON MA Y DAY 1893] 365 It seems that the proletaria n revolutio n overturn s everything , even chronology .
Thus, in Spain at least, May 1 comes after May 2,366 whateve r the calenda r may say about it.
Formerl y the Spanish worker s used to celebrat e May 2, today they celebrat e the 1st of the same month .
From Ma y 2 to May 1, we have made a good deal of progress .
What, in fact happene d on May 2, 1808? The foreign invasion , on the one hand, the people of Madrid on the other.
3 It all seems simple.
An d yet the situatio n was very complicated .
In order to fight th e foreig n invasio n and the tyrann y of Napoleon , the Spanish peopl e also had to fight the French Revolution, 15 and to regain it s independenc e the same Spanis h people was forced to re-establish th e despoti c rule of the fanatica l idiot Ferdinan d VII, supported b y the nobles and the priests .
And it was the same in Italy and in Germany , even in France ; these tw o countrie s could only rid themselve s of the Napoleoni c yoke by turnin g themselve s over, to the monarchist , feudal and clerical reactionaries .
Thus do wars betwee n one people and anothe r make apparentl y the mos t simple and straightforwar d situation s comple x and confused.
But it is a tremendou s step forwar d from May the 2nd to May the 1st: May the 1st denotes a clear and transparen t situation ; two a Crosse d out in the manuscrip t is the followin g passage : "Behin d the foreign army, Napoleon , the self-style d representativ e of the bourgeoi s revolution , in actual fact the domesti c despot , the conquero r of neighbourin g peoples .
Behind the people o f Madrid , the royalty of the imbecili c Bourbons , the feudal nobility , the priests.
Strang e confusion!"— Ed.

[SPEECH A T A SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC MEETING IN BERLI N ON SEPTEMBER 22 , 1893] [NEWSPAPER REPORT] 376 Party Comrades ! I thank you from my heart for the splendi d and undeserve d reception whic h you have given me.
I can only repeat here what I already sai d in Zurich and Vienna a: I regard this receptio n not as a tribute to me personall y but to me as collaborato r and ally of a greater man , as the comrade-in-arm s of Karl Marx, and in this sense I accept it gratefully .
You know that I am not an orator or a parliamentarian; I work in a differen t field, chiefly in the study and with the pen.
And yet I would like to addres s a few words to you.
It is now almos t fifty-on e years to the day since I last saw Berlin.
377 Sinc e then Berlin has been totally transformed .
At that time it was a small, so-calle d "roya l seat" of hardly 350,00 0 inhabitants, livin g off the court, the nobility , the garriso n and the civil service .
Today it is a great capital city with almost two million inhabitants an d lives off industry ; today the court, nobility , garrison an d civil service could seek anothe r home, and Berlin would stil l remain Berlin .
And the industria l developmen t of Berlin ha s brough t about anothe r revolution .
In those days there was not one single Social Democra t in Berlin ; people did not even know wha t Social Democrac y was; a few month s ago, the Social Democrats o f Berlin were passed in review , and mustere d almost 160,000 votes, 378 and Berlin has five Social-Democrati c deputie s out of a total of six representatives .
In this respect Berlin is at the head of all the major Europea n cities and has even outstrippe d Paris by far.
a See this volume , pp.
404-07.
— Ed.
Yet not only Berlin but the whole of the rest of German y has also undergon e this industria l revolution .
I have not been in Germany fo r sixtee n years.
379 As you know—fo r you have personal experienc e of it—the Anti-Socialis t Law has been in force here sinc e 1878, though happil y you have now got rid of it.
As long as this law was in force I avoided comin g to Germany ; I wished t o spare the authoritie s the trouble of deportin g me, which they certainl y would have done.
(Amusement ; cries of "They certainly woul d have done!" ) And now, on my presen t journey , I have bee n able to see with my own eyes how splendi d is the turnabout tha t has taken place in Germany' s economi c situation .
One generatio n ago German y was an agricultura l country whose rural populatio n comprise d two-third s of the total; today it is an industrial countr y of the first order, and along the entire length of the Rhine , from the Dutch border to the Swiss, I did not find a single littl e spot where you can look aroun d you withou t seeing chimneys.
Certainly , this seems at first sight to concer n nobod y but the capitalists .
But by expandin g industr y the capitalist s are not only creatin g surplu s value, they are also creatin g proletarians ; they are destroyin g the petty-bourgeoi s and small peasan t middle classes; the y are pushin g the class antagonis m betwee n bourgeoisi e and proletaria t to the limit; and those who create proletarian s also create Socia l Democrats .
At every fresh electio n to the Reichstag , the bourgeoisi e is dismaye d at the irresistibl e growt h of the Social-Democratic vote .
They ask, "How does it come about? " Well, if they had any sense they would surely see that it is their own work ! So it has come about that the Germa n Social Democrat s are the most united, the most cohesive , the stronges t in the whole world, marchin g from victor y to victory thanks to the calm, the discipline an d the good humou r with which they conduc t their struggles.
Part y comrades , I am convince d that you will continu e to do your duty, and so I conclud e with the cry: "Long live international Social Democracy!'''' First publishe d in the Vorwärts, No.

The first : "Once Again 'Herr Vogt ' " constitute s the conclusio n of the polemi c on the Italian War 384 carried out in 1859-6 0 between thi s false natura l scientis t and Republican , but genuin e vulgar-liberal Bonapartis t and book manufacture r and Marx.
This essay stampe d the said Mr.
Vog t once an d for all with the character o f a paid Bonapartis t agent, for which Marx, in his Herr Vogt in 1860 coul d obviousl y only supply indirec t evidence .
The secon d essay: The Bakuninists at Work, whic h describe s the action of the anarchist s during the rising in Spain in July 1873, appeared earlie r as a separat e pamphlet .
Even thoug h the anarchist caricatur e of the workers ' movemen t has long passed its climax, th e government s in Europ e and Americ a are much too interested i n its continue d existence , and spend much too much money o n supportin g it, for us to omit any consideratio n of the heroic deed s of the anarchists .
The article is therefor e reprinte d again here .
"A Polis h Proclamation " deals with an aspect of Germany' s relations wit h Easter n Europ e which is often overlooke d today, but which mus t not be neglecte d if these relation s are to be assesse d correctly.
The critiqu e of the "Programm e of the Blanquis t Commun e Refugees" o f 1874 is of special interes t today again, now that, apart fro m the other socialis t groups , a small group of Blanquist s have entere d the French Chambe r of Deputies , with our friend Vaillant at their head.

Rudolf Meyer the Blanquist s have once intervene d decisivel y in events—namel y in 1887, the day of the last presidentia l election followin g Grévy's abdication.
Th e majorit y in the Nationa l Assembl y favoure d Jules Ferry, on e of the most infamou s of all the infamou s suppressor s of the Commune , and one of the most consummat e representa -tives of that opportunis t bourgeoisie 387 which only wants to rule France i n order to bleed it and its colonie s white.
At that time preparations wer e underwa y for an uprisin g in Paris which was to be heade d by the Paris municipa l counci l with the agreemen t of the radica l deputies ; the militar y organisation , however , was in the hands o f the Blanquists , who provide d the officers ' corps, and whose militar y leader , Genera l of the Commun e Eudes, took ove r command an d establishe d his genera l staff office in a café next to the Hote l de Ville .
Faced wit h the threat of this uprising , the opportunists gav e in and elected Carnot .
And recentl y too, when the Russia n naval guests were in Paris, Le Parti socialiste, the Blanquis t weekly , distinguishe d itself by a courageous stand , defyin g all chauvinis t prejudices .
This stand gives us the guarante e that the Blanquis t group in the Chambe r under Vaillant' s leadershi p will do its utmost for the cooperatio n of all th e socialis t groups and their associatio n in a strong socialis t coalition party .
It will be noted that in all these essays, and particularl y in the aforementioned one , I consistentl y do not call myself a Social Democrat, bu t a Communist .
This is becaus e at that time in various countrie s people called themselve s Social Democrat s who had certainl y not inscribe d upon their banner s the taking over by society o f all the means of production .
In France , a Social Democrat wa s conceive d as a democrati c republica n with more or less genuin e but always indefinabl e sympathie s for the workin g class, that is people like Ledru-Rolli n in 1848, and the Proudhon -ist-tinged "radica l socialists " of 1874.
In Germany , the Lassallean s called themselve s Social Democrats ; but althoug h the mass of them increasingly appreciate d the necessit y of socialisin g the means of production, th e specificall y Lassallea n productio n cooperative s with stat e aid nevertheles s remaine d the only publicl y recognise d item on their agenda .
For Marx and myself it was therefor e quite impossible t o choose a name of such elasticit y to describ e our special standpoint .
Today the situatio n is different , and the word can be allowe d to pass, unfittin g as it remain s for a party whose economic programm e is not just generall y socialist , but directl y communist, an d whose ultimat e politica l aim is to surpas s the entire State , and thus democrac y too.
The name s of real political partie s never fit exactly ; the party develops , but the name stays.
The las t essay "On Social Relation s in Russia" , which also appeared i n 1875 in a special edition as a pamphlet , could not possibly b e reprinte d again withou t a more or less comprehensiv e epilogue.
3 Th e questio n of the future of the Russia n peasan t communities occupie s more than ever all Russian s who are concerned abou t the economi c developmen t of their country .
The letter fro m Marx which I quoted b has been given the most diverse interpretations b y the Russia n socialists .
More recently , too, Russians a t home and abroad have repeatedl y urged me to expres s my opinio n on this question .
I baulked at this for a long time, well knowing ho w insufficien t is my knowledg e of the details of the economic situatio n of Russia : how was I to complet e the third volume o f Capital an d in additio n study the truly colossa l mound of literatur e in which old Russia , as Marx liked to say, took inventory befor e its death? Well now, a reprint of "On Social Relations i n Russia " is urgentl y requested , and this circumstanc e forces m e to undertak e the attempt , in expansio n of this old essay, to draw some conclusion s from the historical-comparativ e enquir y into the economi c positio n of Russia today.
These conclusion s may not have turned out unreservedl y in favour of a great future for the Russia n communities , but on the other hand they seek to substantiate th e view that the approachin g dissolutio n of capitalis t society in the West will put Russia too in a position significantl y to shorten it s passag e throug h capitalis m which is now becomin g inevitable.

419 INTRODUCTORY NOT E (1894 ) [TO THE BAKUNINISTS AT WORK] A few pieces of chronologica l informatio n may make it easier to understand th e followin g account .
On Februar y 9, 1873 King Amade o was fed up with his Spanis h kingdom; he—th e first king to go on strike—abdicated .
On the 12th the republi c was proclaimed ; immediatel y after that a new Carlist rebellion brok e out in the Basqu e provinces.
389 On Apri l 10 a constituen t assembl y was elected which met in early Jun e and proclaime d the federativ e republi c on June 8.
On the 11th a new administratio n under Pi y Margall wa s formed.
A t the sam e time a committe e was elected to draw up the new constitution, bu t the extrem e republicans , the so-calle d Intransig -ents, were excluded .
But when this new constitutio n was pro-claimed o n July 3, it did not go far enough for the Intransigent s in breaking Spai n up into "independen t cantons" ; so the Intransig -ents stage d revolts in the provinces ; in the days from July 5 to 11 they triumphe d everywhere : in Seville , Cordoba , Granada , Malaga , Cadiz, Alcoy , Murcia , Cartagena , Valencia , etc.
, and in each of these town s they set up an independen t cantona l government .
On July 18 Pi y Margall resigned an d was replace d by Salmeron , who at once embarke d on a campaig n agains t the insurgents .
The latter were defeate d in a few days, offering little resistance ; on July 26 the rule of the governmen t was restore d throughou t Andalusi a by the fall of Cadiz, while Murcia and Valenci a were suppresse d at roughly th e same time; only Valenci a put up much of a fight.
Cartagena alon e stood firm.
This, the largest naval harbou r in Spain, whic h had fallen into the hands of the rebels along with the fleet, possesse d thirtee n more detache d forts on the landwar d side apart fro m the ramparts , and was thus not easy to capture .
And as the governmen t took good care not to destro y its own naval station, th e "sovereig n Canto n of Cartagena " survive d until January 11 , 1874, when it finally surrendered , becaus e it no longer serve d any earthly purpos e whatsoever .
In this whole disgracefu l insurrectio n we are only concerne d here wit h the even more disgracefu l deeds of the Bakuninis t anarchists; i t is only they who are describe d in any detail here, as a warning t o the rest of the world.

P.
Tkacho v was strictly speakin g not a Bakuninist , i.
e.
an anarchist , but made himsel f out to be a "Blanquist".
Th e error was an understandabl e one, since the said gentleman, i n accordanc e with the Russia n refuge e custom of the time, expresse d his solidarit y with all Russian émigrés against th e West, an d indeed defende d Bakuni n and comrade s agains t my attacks 0 in his pamphlet 0 as if they had been directe d at himself.
391 The view s on the Russia n communisti c peasan t commun e which he champione d vis-à-vis myself wer e essentiall y those of Herzen.
This Pan-Slavis t literar y man, who was puffed up into a revolutionary, ha d discovere d from Haxthausen' s Studien über Rußland 6 that the serfs on his estates know of no private property , but redistribut e the fields and meadow s amongs t themselve s from tim e to time.
As a literary man, he did not need to learn what soo n after becam e commo n knowledge , that the commo n ownership o f land is a form of ownershi p which was, in fact, common t o all people s at a certain stage of development .
It prevailed amon g the Germans , Celts, Indians—i n short, all the Indo-European people s in primeva l times; it still exists in India, was only recentl y suppresse d by force in Irelan d and Scotland , a See this volume , p.

Bu t as a Pan-Slavis t who was at most a socialis t in his rhetoric, h e found in this a fresh pretex t to depict his "holy" Russia an d its mission to rejuvenat e and regenerat e the rotten and decrepit West—i f necessar y by force of arms—i n an even more brilliant ligh t in contras t to the same indolen t West.
What the worn-out Frenc h and Englis h are unable to achiev e for all their pains, the Russian s have at home, ready-made .
"Maintaining th e peasan t commun e and establishin g the freedo m of the individual, extendin g the self-managemen t of the village to the towns and the entire stat e while preservin g nationa l unity—thi s sums up the entire questio n of the futur e of Russia, i.
e.
the questio n of the same social antinom y whose solutio n occupies an d moves the minds of the West" (Herzen, Letters to Linton).
392 So there may be a political questio n for Russia ; but the "social question" i s already solved as far as Russia is concerned .
Herzen's successo r Tkacho v made it just as easy for himself as his master .
Althoug h he could no longer maintai n in 1875 that the "social question " in Russia had alread y been solved , accordin g to him the Russia n peasants—a s born communists—ar e infinitel y closer to socialis m than the poor, god-forsake n West Europea n proletarians, an d are infinitel y better off into the bargain .
When, on the strengt h of a hundred-year-ol d revolutionar y tradition , French republican s conside r their people to be the chosen people from a political point of view, many Russia n socialist s of the day declared tha t Russia was socially the chosen nation ; the rebirth of the old economi c world would, they thought , spring not from the struggles o f the West Europea n proletaria t but from the innermos t interior o f the Russia n peasant .
My attack was directe d at this childish view .
But now the Russia n commun e had also found respec t and recognition amon g people of infinitel y greate r stature than the Herzens and Tkachovs .
They include d Nikola i Chernyshevsky , that grea t thinker to whom Russia owes such a boundles s debt and whose slo w murde r throug h years of exile among Siberia n Yakuts will remai n an eternal disgrac e on the memor y of Alexande r II the "Liberator".
Owing to the Russia n intellectua l embarg o Chernyshevsk y never knew the works of Marx, and when Capital appeare d he had long been captiv e in Sredne-Vilyuis k amon g the Yakuts .
His entire intellectual developmen t had to take place within the surroundin g medium create d by this intellectua l embargo .
What Russia n censorship woul d not let in scarcel y existed for Russia, if at all.
If there ar e sporadi c weaknesses , sporadi c instance s of a limited outlook, the n one can only feel admiratio n that there are not more of them .
Chernyshevsky, too , sees in the Russia n peasan t commun e a means o f progressin g from the existin g form of society to a new stage of development , higher than both the Russia n commun e on the one hand, and West Europea n capitalis t society with its class antagonisms o n the other.
And he sees a mark of superiorit y in the fact that Russia possesse s this means , wherea s the West does not.
"The introductio n of a better order of things is greatly hindere d in Wester n Europe b y the boundles s extensio n of the rights of the individua l .
.
.
it is not easy to renounce eve n a negligibl e portio n of what one is used to enjoying , and in the West th e individua l is used to unlimite d privat e rights .
The usefulnes s and necessity o f mutua l concession s can be learne d only by bitter experienc e and prolonged thought .
In the West, a better system of economi c relation s is bound up with sacrifices , and that is why it is difficul t to establish .
It runs counte r to the habits o f the Englis h and Frenc h peasants.
" But "what seems a Utopia in one country exist s as a fact in anothe r .
.
.
habits which the Englishma n and the Frenchman fin d immensel y difficul t to introduc e into their nationa l life exist in fact in the nationa l life of the Russians.

.
.
The order of things for which the West is now strivin g by such a difficult and long road still exists in our countr y in the mighty nationa l custom s of our village life.

We see what deplorabl e consequence s resulted i n the West from the loss of communa l land tenure and how difficul t it is to give back to the Wester n people s what they have lost.
The exampl e of the West must not be lost on us" (Chernyshevsky , Works, Genev a edition , Vol.
V, pp.
16-19, quoted b y Plekhanov , "Nasi raznoglasija", a Geneva , 1885, [16-17]).
393 And of the Ural Cossacks , who still retaine d communa l tilling of the soil and subsequen t distributio n of the produc e amon g individual families , he says: "If the people of the Urals live under their presen t system to see machine s introduced int o corn-growing , they will be very glad of having retaine d a system which allow s the use of machine s that requir e big-scal e farmin g embracin g hundreds o f dessiatines " (ibid.
, p.
131).
It shoul d not be forgotten , however , that the people of the Urals wit h their communa l tilling—save d from extinctio n by military consideration s (we also have barrack-roo m communism ) — stand alon e in Russia , more or less like the farmstea d communitie s on the Mosel bac k home wit h their periodi c redistributions .
And if they adher e to their presen t system until they are ready for the introduction o f machinery , it will not be they who profit from it, but the Russia n militar y excheque r whose slaves they are.
At any rate, it was a fact: at the same time as capitalis t society was disintegratin g and threatenin g to founde r on the necessar y a T.

29* contradictions of its own development , half of the entire cultivate d land in Russia was still the commo n propert y of the peasan t communes.
Now, if in the West the resolutio n of the contradic -tions by a reorganisatio n of society is conditiona l on the conversio n of all the means of production , hence of the land too, into the common propert y of society, how does the already, or rather still, existing commo n propert y in Russia relate to this commo n property in the West, which still has to be created ? Can it not serve as a point of departur e for a nationa l campaig n which , skipping the entire capitalis t period, will conver t Russian peasan t communism straigh t into moder n socialis t commo n ownershi p of the mean s of productio n by enrichin g it with all the technica l achievements of the capitalis t era? Or, to use the words with which Marx sum s up the views of Chernyshevsk y in a letter to be quoted below: "Shoul d Russi a first destro y the rural commune , as demanded by the liberals , in order to go over to the capitalis t system, or can it on the contrar y acquir e all the fruits of this system, withou t sufferin g its torments , by developin g its own historical conditions?" 3 The ver y way in which the questio n is posed indicate s the direction in which the answer should be sought.
The Russian commune has existed for hundred s of years withou t ever providing the impetus for the developmen t of a higher form of common ownershi p out of itself; no more so than in the case of the Germa n Mark system , the Celtic clans, the Indian and other communes wit h primitive , communisti c institutions .
In the course of time, under the influenc e of commodit y productio n surround -ing them , or arising in their own midst and graduall y pervadin g them, and of the exchang e betwee n individua l familie s and individual persons , they all lost more and more of their communistic characte r and dissolve d into communitie s of mutuall y independent landowners .
So if the questio n of whethe r the Russian commun e will enjoy a differen t and better fate may be raised at all, then this is not through any fault of its own, but solely due to the fact that it has survived in a Europea n countr y in a relativel y vigorou s form into an age when not only commodit y production as such, but even its highest and ultimat e form, capitalist production , has come into conflic t in Western Europ e with the productiv e forces it has created itself; when it is proving incapable of continuin g to direct these forces ; and when it is a K.

foundering on these innate contradiction s and the class conflict s that go along with them.
It is quite eviden t from this alone that the initiativ e for any possibl e transformatio n of the Russian commune alon g these lines cannot come from the commun e itself, but only from the industria l proletarian s of the West.
The victory of the West Europea n proletaria t over the bourgeoisie , and, linked to this, the replacemen t of capitalis t productio n by socially managed production—tha t is the necessar y preconditio n for raising the Russian commun e to the same level.
The fact is: at no time or place has the agrarian communis m that aros e out of gentile society develope d anythin g of its own accord but its own disintegration .
As early as 1861 the Russian peasant commun e itself was a relativel y weakene d form of this communism; the commo n tilling of the land which survive d in some part s of India and in the South Slav househol d communit y (zâdruga), the probabl e mothe r of the Russian commune , had been forced to give way to cultivatio n by individua l families ; commo n ownership onl y continue d to manifes t itself in the redistributio n of land whic h took place at greatly varyin g interval s accordin g to the different localities .
This redistributio n needs only to lapse or be abolished by decree, and the village of allotmen t peasant s is a fait accompli.
But the mere fact that alongsid e the Russian peasan t commun e capitalist productio n in Wester n Europ e is simultaneousl y ap-proaching the point where it breaks down and where it points itself to a new form of productio n in which the means of production are employe d in a planned manne r as social proper -ty—this mer e fact cannot endow the Russian commun e with the power to develop this new form of society out of itself.
How could it appropriat e the colossal productiv e forces of capitalis t society as social propert y and a social tool even before capitalis t society itself has accomplishe d this revolution ; how could the Russian commun e show the world how to run large-scal e industr y for the commo n benefit, whe n it has already forgotte n how to till its land for the common benefit ? Certainly, ther e are enough peopl e in Russia who are quite familiar wit h Wester n capitalis t society with all its irreconcilabl e antagonisms and conflicts and are also clear about the way out of this apparen t dead-end .
But firstly, the few thousan d people who realise thi s do not live in the commune , and the fifty million or so in Great Russia who still live with commo n ownershi p of the land have not the faintest idea of all this.
They are at least as alien and unsympathetic to these few thousan d as the English proletarian s from 180 0 to 1840 with regard to the plans which Rober t Owen devised fo r their salvation .
And, of the workme n whom Owen employed i n his factory in New Lanark , the majorit y likewis e consisted o f people who had been raised on the institution s and customs o f a decayin g communisti c gentile society , the Celtic -Scottish clan ; but nowher e does he so much as hint that they showed a greater appreciatio n of his ideas.
And secondly , it is an historical impossibilit y that a lower stage of economi c developmen t should solv e the enigma s and conflict s which did not arise, and could no t arise, until a far higher stage.
All forms of gentile community whic h arose before commodit y productio n and indi-vidual exchang e have one thing in commo n with the future socialist society : that certain things , means of production , are subject t o the commo n ownershi p and the commo n use of certain groups.
Thi s one shared featur e does not, however , enable the lower for m of society to engende r out of itself the future socialis t society, thi s final and most intrinsi c produc t of capitalism .
Any given economi c formatio n has its own problem s to solve, problem s arising ou t of itself; to seek to solve those of another , utterly alien formation woul d be absolutel y absurd .
And this applies to the Russian commun e no less than to the South Slav zâdruga, the Indian gentil e econom y or any other savage or barbari c form of society characterise d by the commo n ownershi p of the means of production.
On the other hand, it is not only possibl e but certain that after the victor y of the proletaria t and the transfe r of the means of production int o commo n ownershi p among the West Europea n peoples, th e countrie s which have only just succumbe d to capitalis t production an d have salvage d gentil e institutions , or remnant s thereof, have in these remnant s of commo n ownershi p and in the corresponding popula r custom s a powerfu l means of appreciabl y shortening th e proces s of developmen t into a socialist society and of sparin g themselve s most of the sufferin g and struggle s throug h which w e in Wester n Europ e must work our way.
But the exampl e and the active assistanc e of the hithert o capitalis t West is an indispensable conditio n for this.
Only when the capitalis t econom y has been relegate d to the history books in its homelan d and in the countries wher e it flourished , only when the backwar d countrie s see from this exampl e "how it's done", how the productiv e forces of moder n industr y are placed in the service of all as social property—only the n can they tackle this shortene d proces s of development.
Bu t then success will be assured .
And this is true of all countrie s in the pre-capitalis t stage, not only Russia .
It will be easiest—comparatively speaking—i n Russia , however , becaus e there a section of the indigenou s populatio n has already assimi -lated th e intellectua l results of capitalis t development , thereb y making it possible in revolutionar y times to accomplis h the social transformation mor e or less simultaneousl y with the West.
This wa s stated by Marx and me as long ago as Januar y 21, 1882 in the prefac e to Plekhanov' s Russia n translatio n of the Communist Manifesto.
Th e passag e reads: "Alongside a rapidly developin g capitalis t swindle and bourgeoi s landed propert y which is only just in the proces s of formation , in Russia w e find the greate r part of the land in the commo n ownership o f the peasants .
Now the questio n is: can the Russia n commune, thi s form of the origina l commo n ownershi p of land which is actually alread y in a state of severe disintegration , make the direc t transitio n into a higher communis t form of landed property—or mus t it first underg o the same process of dissolutio n that characterise s the historica l developmen t of the West? The only possibl e answer to this questio n today is as follows : when the Russian revolutio n gives the signal for a workers ' revolutio n in the West, so that each complement s the other, then Russia n landed property migh t becom e the startin g point for a communis t development.
" 394 It shoul d not be forgotten , however , that the considerabl e disintegration o f Russia n commo n propert y mentione d above has since advance d significantly .
The defeat s of the Crimea n War 395 had expose d Russia' s need for rapid industria l development .
Above al l railway s were needed , and these are not possibl e on a broad footin g withou t large-scal e domesti c industry .
The precondi -tion for this was the so-calle d emancipatio n of the serfs; it marked the beginnin g of the capitalis t era in Russia ; but hence also the era of the rapid destructio n of the commo n ownershi p of land.
The redemption payment s impose d on the peasants , togethe r with increased taxe s and the simultaneou s reductio n and deterioratio n of the land allotte d to them, inevitabl y forced them into the hands of usurers , chiefly member s of the peasan t commun e who had grown rich .
The railway s opened up for hithert o remote areas a market fo r their grain, but they also brough t the cheap product s of large-scal e industr y to them, thereb y killing off the cottag e industry o f the peasants , who had previousl y manufacture d simila r goods partl y for their own use and partly for sale.
The traditiona l conditions o f employmen t were throw n into confusion ; there followed th e breakdow n which everywher e accompanie s the transition fro m a subsistenc e econom y to a money economy ; within th e commun e large difference s in wealth appeare d betwee n the members—deb t turned the poorer into the slaves of the rich.
In short , the same proces s that had caused the Athenia n gens to break dow n in the period before Solon, with the advent of the money economy, * now bega n to break down the Russia n commune.
Solo n was able to liberat e the slaves of debt, it is true, by mean s of a revolutionar y interventio n in the then still fairly recent la w of private propert y by simply annullin g the debts.
But he could not revitalis e the old Athenia n gens, any more than any power in the world will be able to restore the Russia n commun e once its breakdow n has reache d a certain point.
And to cap it all the Russia n Governmen t has forbidde n redistributio n of land among th e member s of the commun e more frequentl y than every twelve years , so that the peasan t should grow increasingl y unaccustomed t o it and start to think of himsel f as the private owner o f his share.
This wa s the tenor of Marx's comment s in a letter to Russia which he wrote back in 1877.
b A certain Mr.
Zhukovsky , the same man wh o as head cashie r of the State Bank now lends his signature t o Russia n credit notes, had writte n somethin g about Marx in the European Herald (Vestnik Yevropy), t o which anothe r writer ha d replie d in the National Records (Otechestvenniye Zapis-ki).
396 In order to correc t this article Marx wrote a letter to the editor of the Records? which , after copies of the French origina l had lon g been circulatin g in Russia , appeare d in Russia n translation i n the Herald of the People's Will (Vestnik Narodnoi Voli) in 1886 in Genev a and later in Russia itself.
397 Like everythin g that emanated fro m Marx , this letter attracte d a good deal of attentio n and varyin g interpretation s in Russia n circles , and I therefor e present it s gist here.
First, Mar x repudiate s the view attribute d to him in the Records that he shared the opinio n of the Russia n liberals , accordin g to which nothin g was more urgen t for Russia than to destro y the communal propert y of the peasant s and plung e headlon g into capitalism.

a Marx then continues 5: This passag e "can under no circumstance s provid e the key to my opinio n of the efforts " (the followin g is quoted in Russia n in the original ) " 'of Russia n men to find a course of developmen t for their native countr y which differ s from that which Wester n Europ e has followe d and is still following' , etc.
— In the Afterwor d to the second Germa n edition o f Capital, I speak of a 'great Russian schola r and critic'" (Chernyshevsky) "wit h the high esteem which he deserves.
0 In his noteworthy article s the latter dealt with the questio n whethe r Russia shoul d start, as its liberal economist s demand , by destroyin g the rura l commun e in order to go over to a capitalis t system , or whether, o n the contrary , it can acquir e all the fruits of this system, withou t sufferin g its torments , by developin g its own historical conditions .
He comes out in favou r of the secon d solution.
"Be tha t as it may, as I do not like to leave anythin g to 'guesswork', I will speak straigh t out.
In order to be able to assess Russia's economi c developmen t from the positio n of an expert , I learned Russia n and then spent several long years studyin g official publications an d others with a bearing on this subject .
I have arrived a t this result: if Russia continues along the path it has followed since 1861, it will miss the finest chance that history has ever offered a nation, only to undergo all the fatal vicissitudes of the capitalist system?"

"Now, i n what way was my critic able to apply this historica l sketch t o Russia? " (The accoun t of primitiv e accumulatio n in Capital.
) "Onl y this: if Russia is tendin g to becom e a capitalis t nation, o n the model of the countrie s of Wester n Europe, — and in recent year s it has gone to great pains to move in this direction—it wil l not succee d withou t having first transforme d a large proportio n of its peasant s into proletarians ; and after that, once it has been placed in the bosom of the capitalis t system, it will be subjecte d to its pitiless laws, like other profan e peoples .
That is all.
" Thus wrot e Marx in 1877.
At that time there were two governments i n Russia : the Tsar's and that of the secret executiv e committee (ispolnitel'ny j komitet 3) of the terroris t conspirators.
398 The powe r of this secret second governmen t grew daily.
The fall of tsardo m seeme d imminent ; a revolutio n in Russia was bound to deprive th e entire forces of Europea n reactio n of its mainstay , its great reserv e army, and thus give the politica l movemen t of the West a mighty new impuls e and, what is more, infinitel y more favourable condition s in which to operate .
No wonde r that Marx advises th e Russian s to be in less of a hurry to make the leap into capitalism.
The Russia n revolutio n did not come.
Tsardo m got the better of terrorism, whic h even manage d to drive all the propertied , "law-abiding" classe s back into its arms for the time being.
And in the seventee n years which have elapse d since that letter was written bot h capitalis m and the dissolutio n of the peasan t commune hav e made tremendou s headwa y in Russia .
So how do matters stan d today, in 1894? When th e old tsarist despotis m continue d unchange d after the defeats o f the Crimea n War and the suicide of Tsar Nicholas , only one road was open: the swiftes t transitio n possibl e to capitalis t industry.
Th e army had been destroye d by the giganti c dimension s of the empire , on the long marche s to the theatr e of war; the distances ha d to be nullifie d by a strategi c railway network .
But railways mea n capitalis t industr y and the revolutionisin g of primitiv e agriculture.
Fo r one thing, the agricultura l produc e of even the remotest area s is brough t into direct contact with the world market ; for another , an extensiv e railway system canno t be constructe d and kept workin g withou t domesti c industr y to supply rails, locomotives , rolling stock , etc.
But it is not possibl e to introduc e one branc h of large-scale industr y withou t acceptin g the entire system ; the textile a Engels' transliteration o f the Russia n words.
— Ed.
industry o n a relativel y moder n footing , which had alread y taken root both in the region of Moscow and Vladimi r and on the Baltic coasts, receive d fresh impetus .
The railway s and factorie s were accompanied b y the expansio n of existin g banks and the establishment o f new ones; the emancipatio n of the peasant s from serfdom institute d freedo m of movement , in anticipatio n of the ensuing automati c emancipatio n of a large proportio n of these peasants fro m landownershi p too.
Thus in a short while all the foundations o f the capitalis t mode of productio n were laid in Russia.
But the axe had also been taken to the root of the Russian peasan t commune.
To lamen t this fact now is futile.
Had the despotis m of the tsars been replace d after the Crimea n War by the direct parliamentar y rule of nobles and bureaucrats , the process might have been slowed down somewhat ; if the burgeonin g bourgeoisi e had taken the helm, it would certainl y have been accelerate d even more.
As things were, there wa s no alternative .
Alongsid e the Second Empir e in France and the most brillian t rise of capitalis t industr y in England , it could really no t be demande d of Russia that it plunge headlon g into state-socialist experiment s on accoun t of the peasan t commune .
Something ha d to happen .
What was possibl e under the cir-cumstances di d happen , as everywher e and always in countrie s engaged i n commodit y production , in most cases only semi-consciously o r quite mechanically , and withou t knowin g what was being done .
Now cam e the new age of revolutio n from above initiate d by Germany, an d hence the age of the rapid growth of socialis m in all Europea n countries .
Russia took part in the genera l movement .
There i t took the form—a s if it went withou t saying—o f an assault aime d to bring about the fall of tsarist despotism , to attain intellectual an d politica l freedom of action for the nation.
A faith in the miraculou s power of the peasan t commun e to bring about a social renaissance— a faith for which Chernyshevsky , as we have seen, wa s not entirel y blameless—thi s faith played its part in heightening th e enthusias m and energ y of the heroic Russia n pioneers.
W e do not blame the people , scarcely more than a few hundred i n number , who throug h their selfless devotio n and heroism brough t tsarist absolutis m to the point where it was forced to conside r the possibilit y and the condition s of surrender—w e do not blam e them for regardin g their Russia n compatriot s as the chosen peopl e of the social revolution .
But this does not mean we need to share their illusion .
The age of chosen people s is gone for ever.
But durin g this struggl e capitalis m went from strengt h to strength i n Russia and increasingl y achieve d what terroris m was unable t o do: to force tsardo m to surrender .
Tsardom neede d money .
Not merely for the luxury of its court, its bureaucracy , above all for its army and its foreign policy based on bribery , but notably also for its miserabl e finance system and the idioti c railway policy that went hand in hand with it.
Foreign countries woul d not and could not any longer find the money for all the Tsar's deficits ; help had to come from home .
A proportio n of the railway s shares had to be dispose d of at home, as had a proportion o f the loans.
The Russia n bourgeoisie' s first victory lay in the railway concessions , which guarantee d the share-holder s all future profit s while loadin g all future losses on the state.
Then came th e subsidie s and premium s for industria l enterprises , and the protectiv e tariffs favourin g domesti c industr y which eventuall y made it virtuall y impossibl e to impor t many articles .
With its colossal indebtednes s and its credit in almost total ruins abroad , the Russia n state has a direct fiscal interes t in forcin g the development o f domesti c industry .
It constantl y needs g"ld to pay off the interes t on its foreign debts.
But there is no gold in Russia ; all that circulate s there is paper.
Part of it is provide d by the prescribed paymen t of tariffs in gold, which also incidentall y raises these tariff s by fifty per cent.
But the greate r part of it is supposed t o come from the surplu s in the export of Russian raw materials ove r the import of foreign industria l products ; the bills of exchang e drawn on foreign banks for this surplus are bough t by the governmen t at home for paper money and in return it receives gold .
So if the governmen t wishes to meet the paymen t of interest t o foreig n countrie s by some other metho d than new foreign loans , it must ensure that Russia n industr y rapidl y expands t o the point where it is able to meet domesti c deman d in full.
Henc e the requiremen t that Russia must become an industria l nation tha t is self-sufficien t and independen t of other countries ; hence th e frantic efforts of the governmen t to bring the capitalis t development o f Russia to a peak in the space of a few years.
For if this does not take place, there will be no option s but to draw on the metalli c war funds accumulate d in the State Bank and the State Exchequer , or else state bankruptcy .
In either case Russia n foreign polic y would be finished .
One thin g is clear: in these circumstance s the fledglin g Russia n bourgeoisie ha s the state completel y in its power.
In all economi c matters o f importanc e the state must do its bidding .
If for the time bein g the bourgeoisi e continue s to put up with the despoti c autocracy o f the Tsar and his officials , it is only becaus e this autocracy, mitigate d as it is by the venalit y of the bureaucracy , offers it more guarantee s than would change s even of a bourgeois-liberal nature , whose consequence s no one could foresee, give n the presen t interna l situatio n in Russia .
And so the transformation o f the countr y into a capitalis t industria l nation , the proletarianisatio n of a large proportio n of the peasantr y and the deca y of the old communisti c commun e proceed s at an ever quickening pace .
Whether enoug h of this commun e has been saved so that, if the occasion arises , as Marx and I still hoped in 1882, it could becom e the poin t of departur e for communis t developmen t in harmon y with a sudden chang e of directio n in Wester n Europe, " I do not presume t o say.
But this much is certain : if a remnan t of this commune i s to be preserved , the first conditio n is the fall of tsarist despotism—revolution i n Russia .
This will not only tear the great mass of the nation , the peasants , away from the isolatio n of their villages, whic h compris e their "mir", b399 thei r "world" , and lead them ou t onto the great stage, where they will get to know the outside worl d and thus themselves , their own situatio n and the means o f salvatio n from their presen t distress ; it will also give the labour movemen t of the West fresh impetu s and create new, better condition s in which to carry on the struggle , thus hastenin g the victor y of the moder n industria l proletariat , withou t which present-day Russi a can never achiev e a socialist transformation , whether proceedin g from the commun e or from capitalism .

[THE THIR D VOLUM E OF KAR L MARX' S CAPITAL] The thir d book of Marx's Capital i s now being printed and will, we hope , appear not later than this September .
The content s of this long-awaite d third book will conclud e the theoretica l part of the work , leaving only the fourth and final book, which will contain a critical historica l survey of the theorie s of surplu s value.
401 Th e first book shows how the capitalist' s surplus value is wrung ou t of the worker , and the second how this surplus value, which initiall y is containe d in product , is realised in the form of money.
Thes e first two books are thus concerne d only with surplus valu e so long as it is still in the hands of its first appropriator, th e industria l capitalist .
But it remain s only partiall y in the hands of this first appropriator ; it is later distribute d to various intereste d parties in the form of commercia l profit, profit of enterprise , interes t and groun d rent; and it is the laws of this distribution tha t are set out in the third book.
With the production, circulatio n and distributio n of surplus value, however , its entire life-cycl e is conclude d and there is nothin g more to say about it.
Apart from the laws of the profit rate in general , the third boo k examine s commercia l capital , interest-bearin g capital , credit an d banks , ground rent and landed property , which in conjunction wit h the theme s dealt with in the first two books complete th e "Critiqu e of Politica l Economy " promise d in the title.

It will be recalle d that the first boo k was concerne d with "the proces s of capitalis t produc -tion", whil e the second examine d the "proces s of circulatio n of capital".
Th e third book will deal with "the proces s of capitalis t production a s a whole".
Thus the separat e processe s of productio n and circulatio n are no longer examine d each in isolatio n but in their interconnection , as precondition s of, and mere links in, the uniform overal l process of the movemen t of capital.
As each of the first two books only concerne d itself with one of the two main aspects o f this process , the content s turned out to be in need of supplementing an d the form grew one-side d and abstract .
This was particularl y apparen t in the fact that in both books surplu s value coul d only be investigate d in so far and so long as it remained i n the hands of its first appropriator , the industria l capitalist; i t could only be indicate d in genera l terms that this first appropriator wa s not necessarily—o r even usually—it s last ap-propriator.
Bu t it is precisel y in the distributio n of surplu s value among it s variou s intereste d parties—businessmen , money -lenders, landowners , etc.
—tha t the overal l movemen t of capital takes plac e most conspicuousl y and on the surfac e of society , so to speak .

437 [THE FUTUR E ITALIA N REVOLUTIO N AND TH E SOCIALIS T PARTY] 403 The situatio n in Italy is, in my opinion , as follows .
Having com e to power during and after nationa l emancipation , the bourgeoisi e was neither able nor willing to complet e its victory .
It did not sweep away the remain s of feudalism , nor did it reorganise nationa l productio n on moder n bourgeoi s lines.
Incap-able of enablin g the countr y to share in the relative and temporar y benefits o f the capitalis t regime , the bourgeoisi e impose d on it all this regime' s burden s and disadvantages .
Not conten t with that, it has rendere d itself intolerabl e and contemptibl e in the extrem e and for ever throug h its disgracefu l financia l swindles .
Working people—peasants , tradesmen , agricultura l and indus-trial workers—thu s find themselve s crushed , on the one hand, by old-fashioned corrup t practices , not merely the legacy of feudal times bu t also dating from antiquit y (mezzadria? th e latifundia of the south , where cattle are replacin g men) and, on the other, by the mos t voraciou s fiscal policy which the bourgeoi s system has ever devised .
We might well say, with Marx, that we "like all the rest of Continenta l Wester n Europe , suffer not only from the development o f capitalis t production,bu t also from the incomplete -ness of that development .
Alongsid e of moder n evils, a whole series of inherite d evils oppres s us, arising from the passiv e survival o f antiquate d modes of productio n with their inevitabl e train of social and politica l anachronisms , we suffer not only from the living , but from the dead.

30-1550 This situatio n is headin g toward s a crisis.
Everywher e the productive mas s is in a state of ferment ; in places it is rebelling .
Where wil l this crisis lead us? Obviously th e socialis t party is too young and, becaus e of the economic situation , too weak to hope for the immediat e victory of socialism.
Nationwide , the rural populatio n far outnumber s that of the towns ; in the towns there is little large-scal e develope d industry, an d consequentl y few typical proletarians ; the majorit y are mad e up of tradesmen , small shopkeeper s and déclassés, a mass floating betwee n the petty bourgeoisi e and the proletariat .
It is the small an d middl e bourgeoisi e of the Middle Ages in decline and disintegration; fo r the most part they are future , but not yet actual, proletarians .
Only this class, constantl y facing economi c ruin and now provoke d to despair , will be able to supply both the mass of fighter s and the leaders of a revolutionar y movement .
It will be backed by the peasants , whose geographica l dispersa l and illiteracy preven t them from taking any effectiv e initiative , but who will nonetheles s make powerfu l and indispensabl e auxiliaries .
In the event of more or less peacefu l success , there will be a change o f government : the "converted " republicans, 404 Cavallotti & Co.
, would take the rudder ; in the event of revolutio n there wil l be a bourgeoi s republic .
What par t should be played by the socialis t party with regard to these eventualities ? Since 184 8 the tactics which have most often ensure d success for the socialist s have been those of the Communist Manifesto: i n the various stage s of developmen t which the struggl e of the workin g class agains t the bourgeoisi e has to pass through , the socialists 3 always represen t the interest s of the movemen t as a whole.
.
.
, they fight for the attainmen t of the immediat e aims in the interes t of the workin g class, but in the movemen t of the present , they also represent an d take care of the future of that movement.
b—Thus they take an active part in each of the evolutionar y phases throug h which th e struggl e of the two classes passes, withou t ever losing sight of the fact that these phases are only so many stages leading to the great goal: the conques t of politica l power by the proletaria t as a means of social reorganisation .
They have their place among the combatant s for any immediat e advantag e which can be obtained i n the interes t of the workin g class; they accept all these a "Communists " in the Manifesto of the Communist Party.

Future Italian Revolutio n and the Socialis t Party 439 political an d social advantages , but only as advance payments.
Therefore the y conside r every revolutionar y or progressiv e movement t o be headin g in the same directio n as their own; their special missio n is to drive the other revolutionar y parties forward s and, shoul d one of these parties be victorious , to safeguar d the interests o f the proletariat .
These tactics, which never lose sight of the grea t goal, spare the socialist s the bouts of disillusionmen t to which th e less clear-sighte d partie s are invariabl y subject — whether pur e republicans , or sentimenta l socialist s who mistak e a mere stag e for the final outcom e of the march forwards .
Let us apply this to Italy.
The victor y of the disintegratin g petty bourgeoisi e and the peasants ma y thus lead to a governmen t of "converted " republicans .
That woul d give us universa l suffrag e and much greate r freedo m of action (freedo m of the press, assembly , association , abolitio n of the ammonizione? etc.
) — new weapon s which are not to be despised.
Or a bourgeoi s republi c with the same people and a few Mazzin i supporters.
Tha t would widen our freedom of action and field of action eve n more, at least for the moment .
And the bourgeoi s republic, sai d Marx, is the sole politica l form in which the struggl e between proletaria t and bourgeoisi e can be decided.
b Not to mention th e repercussion s this would have in Europe .
The victor y of the presen t revolutionar y movemen t cannot , therefore, b e achieve d withou t strengthenin g us and placing us in a more favourabl e environment .
Thus we would be committin g the greates t of errors should we wish to abstain , if in our attitud e to "akin " parties we sought to limit ourselve s to purely negativ e criticism.
Th e time may come when we shall have to co-operat e with the m in a positive fashion .
When will this time come? Obviously it is not up to us to prepar e directl y a movemen t which is not exactly that of the class which we represent .
If the radicals an d republican s believe that the time has come to take to the streets , let them give free rein to their impetuosity ! But we have bee n deceive d all too often by the grandios e promise s of these gentleme n to let ourselve s fall into the trap once again.
Neither thei r proclamation s nor their conspiracie s should affect us.

If, on the contrary , the movemen t is truly national , our men will be there before the order can be given, and it goes withou t saying that we shall take part.
But it must be understood , and we should proclaim it aloud, that we are taking part as an independent party, allied fo r the momen t with the radical s and the republicans , but entirely distinc t from them ; that we have no illusion s about the result of the struggle , in the event of victory ; that for us this result, fa r from satisfyin g us, will only be a stage that has been won, a new base of operation s for further conquests ; that on the very day of victory our paths will diverge ; that from that day hence w e shall form the new opposition vis-à-vis the new government, no t a reactionar y oppositio n but a progressiv e one, an oppositio n of the extrem e left which will be pressin g for new conquests beyon d the territor y alread y gained .
After th e joint victory we might be offered a few seats in the new government , but alway s in a minority.
Thi s is the greatest danger .
After Februar y 1848 the Frenc h socialis t democrats (o f the Réforme, Ledru-Rollin, L .

In all this I am merel y giving my persona l opinion , becaus e I have bee n asked for it, and also with the greates t diffidence .
As for the genera l tactics ; I have experience d their effectivenes s throughout m y life; they have never let me down.
But as for applying the m to the state of affairs in Italy, that is quite a different matter ; that must be decide d on the spot and by those who are in the midst of events .

Like the latter, Christianit y was originall y a movemen t of oppresse d people : it first appeare d as the religio n of slaves and freedmen , of poor people deprive d of all rights, of people s subjugate d or disperse d by Rome .
Both Christianit y and the workers ' socialis m preac h forthcoming salvatio n from bondag e and misery ; Christianit y places thi s salvatio n in a life beyond , after death, in heaven ; socialism place s it in this world, in a transformatio n of society .
Both are persecute d and subjecte d to harassment , their adherent s are ostracise d and made the objects of exceptiona l laws, the ones as enemie s of the human race, the others as enemie s of the state, enemies o f religion , the family, the social order.
And in spite of all persecution, nay , even spurre d on by it, they forge victoriously , irresistibly ahead .

even becam e dominant—i n Christianity .
Only this Christianity , as was boun d to be the case in the historica l conditions , did not seek to accomplish th e social transformatio n in this world, but in the hereafter, i n heaven , in eterna l life after death, in the impendin g "millennium".
The paralle l betwee n the two histori c phenomen a become s perfectly obviou s as early as the Middle Ages in the first risings of the oppresse d peasant s and particularl y of the town plebeians .
These risings , like all mass movement s of the Middle Ages, were bound t o wear the mask of religio n and appeare d as the restoration o f early Christianit y from spreadin g degeneration* ; but behin d the religiou s exaltatio n there were every time extremely tangibl e worldl y interests .
This was demonstrate d most splendidly i n the organisatio n of the Bohemia n Taborite s under Jan Zizka, 413 of gloriou s memory ; but this trait pervade s the whole of the Middle Ages until it graduall y fades away after the Germa n Peasant War 414 to revive again with the worker communist s after 1830.
The French revolutionar y communists , as also in particula r Weitling and his supporters , referre d to early Christianit y long before Ernes t Renan said: When yo u want to get an idea of the early Christia n communities , look at a local section o f the Internationa l Workin g Men's Association .
This Frenc h man of letters, who by mutilatin g Germa n criticis m of the Bible in a manne r unprecedente d even in moder n * A peculiar counterpar t to this was the religiou s risings in the Mohammeda n world, particularl y in Africa .
Islam is a religion adapte d to Orientals , especiall y Arabs, i.
e.
, on the one hand to townsme n engage d in trade and industry , on the other to nomadi c Bedouins .
Therei n lies, however , the embry o of a periodicall y recurring collision .
The townspeopl e grow rich, luxuriou s and lax in observin g the "law".
Th e Bedouins , poor and hence of strict morals , contemplat e with envy and covetousness thes e riches and pleasures .
Then they unite under a prophet , a Mahdi, t o chastis e the apostate s and restore the observatio n of the ritual and the true fait h and to appropriat e in recompens e the treasure s of the renegades .
In a hundred year s they are naturall y in the same positio n as the renegade s were: a new purge of the faith is required , a new Mahd i arises and the game starts again from the beginning .
That is what happene d from the campaign s of conques t by the African Almoravid s and Almohad s in Spain to the last Mahdi of Khartoum 412 who so successfull y thwarte d the English .
It happene d in the same way or similarl y with the rising s in Persia and other Mohammeda n countries .
All these movement s are couched i n religio n but they have their source in economi c causes ; and yet, even when the y are victorious , they allow the old economi c condition s to persis t untouched.
S o the old situatio n remain s unchange d and the collisio n recurs periodically.
I n the popula r risings of the Christia n West, on the contrary , the religious disguis e is only a flag and a mask for attacks on an economi c order which is becomin g antiquated .
This is finally overthrown , a new one arises and the world progresses.
journalism compose d the novel on churc h histor y Origines du christianisme? did not know himsel f how much truth there was in the word s just quoted .
I should like to see the old "International " who can read, for example , what goes under the name of the Second Epistl e of Paul to the Corinthian s withou t old wound s re-opening, a t least in one respect .
The whole epistle , from chapter eigh t onwards , echoes the eternal , and oh so well-know n complaint: les cotisations ne rentrent pas —contributions are not coming in ! How many of the most zealous propagandist s of the sixties woul d sympathisingl y squeez e the hand of the author of that epistle , whoeve r he may be, and whisper : "So it was like that with you too!" We too—Corinthian s were legion in our Associa -tion—can tel l you a tale about contribution s not coming in but tantalising u s as they floated elusivel y before our eyes.
They were the famou s "million s of the International" ! One of our best source s on the first Christian s is Lucian of Samosata, th e Voltair e of classic antiquity , who was equall y sceptical toward s every kind of religiou s superstitio n and therefor e had neithe r pagan-religiou s nor politica l ground s to treat the Christians otherwis e than as some other kind of religiou s community.
O n the contrary , he mocke d them all for their superstition, thos e who worshippe d Jupite r no less than those who worshipped Christ ; from his shallow rationalisti c point of view one sort of superstitio n was as stupid as the other.
This in any case impartial witnes s relates among other things the life story of a certain adventure r Peregrinus , who called himsel f Proteus , from Parium i n Hellespontus .
When a youth, this Peregrinu s made his début in Armeni a by committin g adultery .
He was caught in the act and lynche d accordin g to the custom of the country .
He was fortunate enoug h to escape and, after stranglin g his father in Parium, h e had to flee.
"And so it happened " — I quote from Schott' s translatio n —"tha t he also came to hear of the astonishin g learnin g of the Christians , with whose priests and scribes h e had cultivate d intercours e in Palestine .
He made such progres s in a short time tha t his teacher s were like childre n compare d with him.
He became a prophet , an elder , a master of the synagogue , in a word, all in everything .
He interprete d their writing s and himsel f wrote a great numbe r of works, so that finally people saw in him a superio r being, let him lay down laws for them and made him their overseer (bishop).
.
.
.
On that ground " (i.
e.
, because he was a Christian ) "Proteu s was at length arreste d by the authoritie s and thrown into prison.
.
.
.
As he thus lay in chains , the Christians , who saw in his captur e a great misfortune , made all possible attempt s to free him.
But they did not succeed .
Then they administere d to him in all possibl e ways with the greates t solicitude .

Frederick Engel s see aged mothers , widows and young orphan s crowdin g at the door of his prison; the most prominen t among the Christian s even bribed the warder s and spent whole nights wit h him; they took their meals with them and read their holy books in his presence; briefly , the belove d Peregrinu s (he still went by that name) was no less to them tha n a new Socrates .
Envoys of Christia n communitie s came to him even from town s in Asia Minor to lend him a helping hand, to console him and to testify in his favour in court.
It is unbelievabl e how quick these people are to act whenever i t is a questio n of their community ; they immediatel y spare neithe r exertion no r expense .
And thus from all sides money then poured in to Peregrinu s so that his imprisonmen t became for him a source of great income .
For the poor people persuade d themselve s that they were immorta l in body and in soul and that they woul d live for all eternity ; that was why they scorne d death and many of them even voluntaril y sacrifice d their lives.
Then their most prominen t lawgive r convinced the m that they would all be brother s one to anothe r once they were converted, i.
e.
, renounce d the Greek gods, professe d faith in the crucifie d sophis t and lived accordin g to his prescriptions .
That is why they despise all materia l goods without distinctio n and own them in common—doctrine s which they have accepte d in good faith, withou t demonstratio n or proof.
And when a skilful imposto r who knows ho w to make clever use of circumstance s comes to them he can manag e to get rich in a short time and laugh up his sleeve over these simpletons .
For the rest, Peregrinus wa s set free by the then prefec t of Syria.
" Then, afte r a few more adventures , "Our worth y set forth a second time" (from Parium ) "on his peregrinations , the Christians' goo d dispositio n standin g him in lieu of money for his journey : they administered t o his needs everywher e and never let him suffer want.
He was fed for a time in this way.
But then, when he violate d the laws of the Christian s too—I think he was caught eating of some forbidde n food—the y excommunicate d him from thei r community.
" 3 What memorie s of youth come to my mind as I read this passage fro m Lucian ! First of all the "prophe t Albrecht " who from abou t 1840 literall y plundere d the Weitling communist communities i n Switzerland 416 for several years— a tall powerfu l man with a long beard who wandere d on foot throug h Switzerlan d and gathere d audience s for his mysteriou s new Gospe l of world emancipation, bu t who, after all, seems to have been a tolerabl y harmless hoaxe r and soon died.
Then his not so harmles s successor, "Dr.
" Georg Kuhlman n from Holstein, who put to profit th e time when Weitling wa s in priso n to conver t the communities o f French Switzerlan d to his Gospel , and for a time with suc h succes s that he even caught August Becker , by far the cleverest bu t also the bigges t ne'er-do-wel l among them.
This Kuhlmann used to deliver lecture s to them which were publishe d in Genev a in 1845 under the title Die Neue Welt oder das Reich des Geistes auf Erden.

and IX] , written by his supporter s (probabl y Augus t Becker ) we read: "A man was needed who would give utteranc e to all our sorrows , all our longing s and all our hopes, to everything , in a word, which moves our age most deeply.
.
.
This man, who m our age was awaiting , has appeared .
He is Dr.
Georg Kuhlman n of Holstein.
He has come forwar d with the doctrin e of the new world or the kingdo m of the spiri t in reality.
" I hardly need to add that this doctrin e of the new world is nothing mor e than the most vulgar sentimenta l nonsens e rendere d in half-biblica l expression s à la Lamennai s and declaime d with prophet-like arrogance .
But this did not preven t the good Weitlingers fro m carryin g the swindle r shoulder-hig h as the Asian Christians onc e did Peregrinus .
They who were otherwis e arch-democrats an d extrem e equalitarian s to the extent of fosterin g ineradicable suspicio n agains t any schoolmaster , journalist , and any man generall y who was not a manual worker as being an "erudite" wh o was out to exploi t them, let themselve s be persuaded b y the melodramaticall y arraye d Kuhlmann that in the "New World " it would be the wisest of all, id est, Kuhlmann, who would regulat e the distributio n of pleasure s and that therefore , even then , in the Old World , the disciple s ought to bring pleasure s by the bushel to that same wisest of all while they themselve s should b e conten t with crumbs .
So Peregrinu s Kuhlmann lived a splendid lif e of pleasur e at the expens e of the community—a s long as it lasted.
It did not last very long, of course ; the growin g murmurs o f doubter s and unbeliever s and the threat of persecu -tion by the Vaudoi s Governmen t put an end to the "Kingdo m of the Spirit " in Lausanne— Kuhlmann disappeared.
Everybody wh o has know n by experienc e the Europea n working-class movemen t in its beginning s will remembe r dozens of similar examples .
Today such extrem e cases, at least in the larger centres, hav e becom e impossible ; but in remote district s where the movement ha s won new groun d a small Peregrinu s of this kind can still count on temporar y limited success .
And just as all those who can expect no favour s from the official world or are finishe d with it—opponent s of inoculation , supporter s of abstemiousness , vegetarians, anti-vivisectionists , nature-healers , free-cornmunit y preachers418 whos e communitie s have fallen to pieces, authors of new theorie s on the origin of the universe , unsuccessfu l or unfortunate inventors , silent sufferer s of real or imaginar y injustices wh o are termed "good-for-nothin g pettifoggers " by the bureaucracy, hones t fools and dishones t swindlers—al l throng to the working-clas s parties in all countries—s o it was with the first Frederick Engel s Christians.
Al l the element s which had been set free, i.
e.
, shown the door by the dissolutio n of the old world came one after the other int o the orbit of Christianit y as the only elemen t that resisted thi s process of dissolution—fo r the very reason that it was the necessar y produc t of the process—an d that therefor e persiste d and grew while the other element s were but nine-da y wonders .
There wa s no fanaticism , no foolishness , no schemin g that did not attach itsel f to the young Christia n communitie s and did not at least for a time and in isolate d places find attentiv e ears and willing believers .
And like our first communis t workers ' associa -tions th e early Christian s too took with such unprecedente d gullibility t o anythin g which suited their purpos e that we are not even sur e that some fragmen t or other of the "great numbe r of works" Peregrinu s wrote for Christianit y did not find its way into our New Testament .
II German criticis m of the Bible, so far the only scientifi c basis of our knowledg e of the history of early Christianity , went in two directions.
The firs t was that of the Tübingen school, 419 in which , in the broad sense , D.
F.
Strauss must also be included .
In critica l inquiry i t goes as far as a theological schoo l can go.
It admits that the four Gospel s are not eyewitnes s account s but only later adaptations o f writing s that have been lost; that no more than four of the Epistle s attribute d to the apostle Paul are authentic , etc.
It strikes ou t of the historica l narration s all miracle s and contradic -tions, considerin g them unacceptable ; but from the rest it tries "to salvage wha t can be salvaged " and then its nature , that of a theological school , is very evident .
Thus it enabled Renan, who bases himsel f mostly on it, to "salvage " still more by applyin g the same metho d and, moreover , to try to impos e upon us as historically authenticate d many New Testamen t account s that are more tha n doubtfu l and, on top of that, a multitud e of other legends abou t martyrs .
In any case, all that the Tübingen school rejects in the New Testamen t as unhistorica l or apocrypha l can be considered a s definitivel y eliminate d for scientifi c purposes .
The othe r directio n has but one representative— Bruno Bauer.
420 His greates t service consist s not merely in having given a pitiless criticism o f the Gospel s and the Epistle s of the apostles , but in having fo r the first time seriousl y undertake n an inquiry into not only the Jewish and Greco-Alexandria n element s but the purely Greek an d Greco-Roma n element s that first opened for Christiani -ty the career of a world religion .
The legend that Christianit y arose ready-mad e from Judais m and, startin g from Palestine , conquered th e world with its dogma already define d in the main and its morals , has been untenabl e since Bruno Bauer ; it can continue t o vegetat e only in the theologica l facultie s and among those peopl e who wish "to keep religio n alive for the people " even at the expens e of science .
The enormou s influenc e which the Philonic school 421 of Alexandri a and Greco-Roma n vulga r philosophy—Platonic an d especiall y Stoic 422—had on Christianity , which becam e the state religio n under Constantine , is far from having bee n ascertaine d in detail , but its existenc e has been proved an d that is primaril y the achievemen t of Bruno Bauer: he laid the foundatio n of the proof that Christianit y was not imported fro m outside—fro m Judea—int o the Romano-Gree k world an d impose d on it, but that, at least in its world-religio n form, it is the very own produc t of that world.
Bauer, of course , like all those who are fightin g agains t deep-roote d prejudices , overshot th e mark by far in this work.
In order to define also through literar y source s Philo's and particularl y Seneca' s influenc e on emergin g Christianit y and actuall y to show up the author s of the New Testamen t formall y as downrigh t plagiarist s of those philosophers h e had to place the appearanc e of the new religio n about hal f a century later, to reject the opposin g account s of Roman historian s and take extensiv e libertie s with historiograph y as such.
Accordin g to him Christianit y as such appear s only under the Flavians , the literatur e of the New Testamen t only under Hadrian, Antonius and Marcu s Aurelius .
As a result the New Testament account s of Jesus and his disciple s are deprive d for Bauer of any historica l background : they are diluted into legend s in which the phase s of interio r developmen t and the moral struggles o f the first communitie s are transferre d to more or less fictitious persons .
Not Galilee and Jerusalem , but Alexandri a and Rome, accordin g to Bauer, are the birthplace s of the new religion .
If, therefore , the Tübingen school present s to us in the remain s of the New Testamen t stories and literatur e that it left untouche d the absolut e maximu m of what science today can still accept as disputable, Brun o Bauer present s to us the maximu m of what can be contested .
The actual truth lies betwee n these two boundaries .
Whether tha t truth can be defined with the means at our disposa l today is very doubtful .
New discoveries , particularl y in Rome, in the Orient , and above all in Egypt, will contribut e more to this than any criticism .
31-1550 But we have in the New Testamen t a single book whose time of writing ca n be defined within a few months , which must have been written betwee n June 67 and Januar y or April 68a; a book, consequently, whic h belong s to the very beginnin g of the Christia n era and reflect s with the most naïve fidelity an d in the corresponding idiomati c languag e the ideas of the beginnin g of that era .
This book, therefore , in my opinion , is a far more important sourc e from which to define what early Christianit y really wa s than all the rest of the New Testament , which, in its present form , is of a far later date.
This book is called the Revelation o f John.
And as this, apparentl y the most obscure book in the whole Bible, is moreove r today, thanks to Germa n criticism , the most comprehensibl e and the clearest , I shall give my reader s an accoun t of it.
One need s but to look into this book in order to be convince d of the state of great exaltatio n not only of the author , but also of the "surrounding medium " in which he moved .
Our "Revelation " is not the only one of its kind and time.
From the year 164 B.
C.
, when th e first which has reache d us, the Book of Daniel, 423 was written, u p to about 250 A.
D.
, the approximat e date of Commodian's Carmen? Rena n counted n o fewer than fiftee n extant classica l "Apocalypses" , not countin g subsequen t imitations .
(I quote Renan because hi s book is the best known by non-specialists too , and the most accessible.
) That was a time when even in Rome and Greece and still more in Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt an absolutel y uncritica l mixtur e of the crasses t superstition s of the most varyin g people s was indiscriminatel y accepte d and complemented b y pious deceptio n and downrigh t charlatanism ; a time in which miracles , ecstasies , visions , apparitions , divining , gold-making, cabbala 424 and other secret magic played the leading role.
It was in that atmosphere , and, moreover , among a class of people wh o were more incline d than any other to listen to these supernatural fantasies , that Christianit y arose.
For did not the Christian gnostics 425 in Egypt during the second centur y A.

engage extensivel y in alchem y and introduc e alchemisti c notion s into thei r teachings , as the Leyde n papyru s documents , among others, prove .
And the Chaldea n and Judean mathematici,c who , according t o Tacitus , were twice expelle d from Rom e for a A misprin t in Die Neue Zeit; it should read "betwee n June 68 and Januar y or April 69" ; cf.

witchcraft, onc e under Claudiu s and again unde r Vitellius, 3 practised n o other kind of geometr y than the kind we shall find at the basis of John's Revelation .
To this we must add anothe r thing.
All the apocalypse s attribut e to themselve s the right to deceiv e their readers .
Not only were they writte n as a rule by quite differen t people than their alleged authors, an d mostly by people who lived much later, for exampl e the Book of Daniel , the Book of Henoch , the Apocalypse s of Ezra, Baruch, Juda , etc.
, and the Sibyllin e books, 426 but, as far as their main substanc e is concerned , they prophes y only things that had already happene d long before and were perfectl y well known to the real author .
Thus in 164, shortly before the death of Antiochus Epiphanes , the autho r of the Book of Danie l has Daniel, wh o is suppose d to have lived in the time of Nebuchadnez -zar, prophes y the rise and fall of the Persia n and Macedonia n empires an d the beginnin g of the Roman Empire , in order by this proof of his gift of prophec y to prepar e the reader to accept the final prophec y that the peopl e of Israel will overcom e all hardships an d finally be victorious .
If therefor e the Revelatio n of John wer e really the work of its alleged author it would be the only exceptio n among the whole body of apocalypti c literature .
The Joh n who claims to be the author was, in any case, a man of great distinctio n among the Christian s of Asia Minor .
This is borne ou t by the tone of the messag e to the seven churches .
Possibly h e was the apostl e John, whose historica l existence , however, i s not completel y authenticate d but is very probable .
If this apostl e was really the author , so much the better for our point of view.
That would be the best confirmatio n that the Christianit y of this book is real genuin e early Christianity .
Let it be noted in passing that , demonstrably , the Revelatio n was not written by the same autho r as the Gospe l or the three Epistle s which are also attributed t o John.
The Revelatio n consist s of a series of visions .
In the first Christ appears clothe d with a garmen t of a high priest, goes in the midst of seven candlestick s representin g the seven churche s of Asia and dictates t o "John " message s to the seven "angels " of those churches.
Her e at the very beginnin g we see plainly the differenc e between this Christianit y and Constantine' s world religio n formu -lated by the Counci l of Nicaea.
427 The Trinit y is not only unknown, it is even impossibl e here.
Instead of the one Hol y Ghost of subsequen t times we here have the "seven spirit s of God" a Tacitus , Annales, XII, 52 and Historiae, II , 62.
— Ed.
31* construed b y the Rabbis from Isaiah 11:2.
Christ is the son of God, the first and the last, the alpha an d the omega, b y no means God himsel f or equal to God, but on the contrary , "the beginnin g of the creation o f God", hence an emanatio n of God, existing from all eternit y but subordinat e to God, like the above-mentione d seven spirits .
In Chapte r 15:3, the martyr s in heaven sing "the song of Moses the servan t of God, and the song of the Lamb " glorifying God .
Hence Christ here appear s not only as subordinat e to God but even, in a certain respect , on an equal footing with Moses.
Chris t is crucifie d in Jerusale m (11:8) but rises again (1:5, 18); he is "the Lamb" that has been sacrifice d for the sins of the world an d with whose blood the faithful of all tongues and nation s have bee n redeeme d to God.
Here we find the basic idea which enabled earl y Christianit y to develo p into a world religion .
All Semitic an d Europea n religion s of that time shared the view that the gods offende d by the actions of man could be propitiate d by sacrifice; th e first revolutionar y basic idea (borrowe d from the Philonic school ) in Christianit y was that by the one great voluntary sacrific e of a mediato r the sins of all times and all men were atone d for once and for all—in respec t of the faithful .
Thus the necessit y of any further sacrifice s was remove d and with it the basis for a multitud e of religiou s rites: but freedom from rites that made difficul t or forbad e intercours e with peopl e of other confessions wa s the first conditio n of a world religion .
In spite of this the habit of sacrific e was so deeply rooted in nationa l custom s that Catholicism—whic h borrowe d so much from paganism — found it appropriat e to accommodat e itself to this fact by the introduction o f at least the symbolica l sacrific e of the mass.
On the other han d there is no trace whateve r of the dogma of origina l sin in our book.
But wha t is most characteristi c in these messages , as in the whole book, is that it never and nowher e occurs to the author to refer to himself an d his co-believer s by any other name than that of Jews.
He reproache s the member s of the sects in Smyrn a and Philadelphia agains t whom he fulminate s with the fact that they "say they are Jews, and are not but are the synagogu e of Satan" ; of those in Pergamo s he says: they hold the doctrin e of Balaam , who taugh t Balac to cast a stumbling-bloc k before the children of Israel, so that they ate things sacrifice d unto idols, and committe d fornication.
Her e it is therefor e not a case of consciou s Christian s but of people who make out they are Jews.
Granted , their Judaism is a new stage in the developmen t of the earlier one, but for that On the Histor y of Early Christianit y 457 very reaso n it is the only true one.
Hence , when the saints appeared befor e the throne of God there came first 144,00 0 Jews, 12,000 fro m each tribe, and only after them the countles s masses of heathen s who had been converte d to this renovate d Judaism .
That wa s how little our author was aware in the year 69 of the Christian er a that he represente d quite a new phase in the development o f a religion which was to becom e one of the most revolutionary element s in the history of human thought .
We therefor e see that the Christianit y of that time, which was still unawar e of itself, was as differen t as heaven from earth from the later dogmaticall y fixed world religio n of "he Nicene Council ; the one cannot be discerne d in the other.
Here we have neithe r the dogm a nor the moral s of later Christianity , but instead a feeling tha t one is strugglin g agains t the whole world and that the struggle wil l be a victoriou s one; an eagernes s for struggl e and a certainty o f victory which are totally lacking in the Christian s of today an d which are to be found in our time only at the other pole of society , among the socialists .
In fact, the struggl e against an initially overpowerin g world, and at the same time among the novator s themselves , is commo n to the early Christian s and the socialists .
Neithe r of these two great movements wer e made by leader s or prophets—althoug h there are prophet s in plenty in both of them—the y are mass move-ments.
An d mass movement s are bound to be confuse d at the beginning; confuse d becaus e the thinkin g of the masses at first moves amon g contradictions , uncertaintie s and incoherencie s and also becaus e of the role that prophet s still play in them at the beginning.
Thi s confusio n is to be seen in the formatio n of numerous sect s which fight against one anothe r with at least the same zea l as against the commo n externa l enemy .
So it was with early Christianity , so it was in the beginnin g of the socialis t movement, n o matter how much that worrie d the well-meanin g worthies wh o preache d unity where no unity was possible .
So was the Internationa l held togethe r by a uniform dogma ? Quite th e opposite .
There were communist s of the Frenc h pre-1848 tradition , these in turn being themselve s of varyin g complexion: communist s of Weitling' s school and others of the regenerated Communis t League , Proudhonist s dominan t in France and Belgium , Blanquists , the Germa n Workers ' Party, and finally the Bakuninis t anarchists , who for a while had the upper hand in Spain an d Italy, to mentio n only the principa l groups .
It took a whole quarte r of a century from the foundatio n of the Interna -tional befor e the separatio n from the anarchist s was final and 458 Frederick Engel s complete everywher e and unity could be establishe d at least in respect o f most genera l economi c viewpoints .
And that with our means o f communication—railways , telegraph , giant industria l cities, the press, organise d people' s assemblies .
There wa s among the early Christian s the same divisio n into countless sects , which was the very means by which discussio n and thereby, a t a later date, unity was achieved .
We already find it in this book , which is beyond doubt the oldest Christia n document , and our author fights it with the same irreconcilabl e ardour as the great sinfu l world outside .
There were first of all the Nicolaitans , in Ephesu s and Pergamos ; those that said they were Jews but were the synagogu e of Satan , in Smyrn a and Philadelphia ; the supporters o f Balaam , who is called a false prophet , in Pergamos ; those wh o said they were apostle s and were not, in Ephesus ; and finally, i n Thyatira , the supporter s of the false prophetes s known as Jezebel .
We are given no more details about these sects, it being only said about the follower s of Balaam and Jezebe l that they ate things sacrifice d to idols and committe d fornication .
Attempt s have bee n made to conceiv e these five sects as Pauline Christian s and all the message s as directe d agains t Paul, the false apostle , the alleged Balaa m and "Nicolaos".
Arguments t o this effect, hardly tenable, ar e to be found collecte d in Renan' s Saint Paul (Pari s 1869, pp.
303-05 and 367-70) .
They all amoun t to explainin g the messages b y the Acts of the Apostle s and the so-calle d Epistle s of Paul, writing s which, at least in their presen t form, are no less than 60 years younge r than the Revelatio n and the relevan t factual dat a of which, therefore , are not only extremel y doubtfu l but also totally contradictory .
But the decisiv e thing is that it could not occu r to the author to give five differen t names to one and the same sec t and even two to Ephesu s alone (false apostle s and Nicolaitans) an d two also to Pergamo s (Balaamite s and Nicolaitans), an d each time refer to them explicitl y as two different sects .
At the same time one cannot deny the probabilit y that ther e were also element s among these sects that would be termed Paulin e today.
In both cases where furthe r details are given the accusatio n amounts t o eating meats offered to idols and to fornication , two points o n which the Jews—th e old ones as well as the Christia n ones—were i n continua l disput e with converte d heathens .
The meat fro m heathe n sacrifice s was not only served at banquet s where refusa l of the food offere d would have seemed imprope r and coul d even have been dangerous ; it was also sold on the public markets , where it was not always possibl e to ascertai n whether i t was kosher or not.
By fornicatio n the Jews understoo d not only extra-nuptia l sexual relation s but also marriag e within the degrees o f kinship prohibite d by Jewish law or betwee n a Jew and a gentile , and it is in this sense that the word is generall y understood i n the Acts of the Apostle s 15:20 and 29.
But our John ha s his own views on the sexua l relation s allowe d to orthodox Jews .
He says, 14:4, of the 144,00 0 heavenl y Jews: "These ar e they which were not defiled with women ; for they are virgins.
" And in fact, in our John's heaven there is not a single woman .
He therefor e belong s to the trend, which also often appear s in other earl y Christia n writings , that consider s sexual relation s generally a s sinful.
And if we moreove r take into consideratio n that he calls Rome the Great Whore with whom the kings of the earth hav e committe d fornicatio n and have becom e drunk with the wine of fornicatio n and the merchant s of the earth have waxed ric h throug h the abundanc e of her delicacies , it become s impossible fo r us to take the word in the message s in the narrow sense tha t theologica l apologist s would like to attribut e to it in order thu s to pick up some corroboratio n for other passage s in the New Testament .
On the contrary .
These passage s in the message s are an obviou s indicatio n of a phenomeno n commo n to all tempestuous times , that the traditiona l bonds of sexual relations , like all other fetters , are shaken off.
In the first centurie s of Christianity, too , there appeare d often enough , side by side with asceticism whic h mortifie d the flesh, the tendenc y to exten d Christian freedo m to more or less unrestraine d intercours e between ma n and woman .
The same thing was observe d in the modern socialis t movement .
What unspeakabl e horror was felt in the then "pious nursery" 3 of German y at Saint-Simon' s réhabilita­ tion de la chair b in the thirties , which was rendere d in Germa n as "Wiedereinsetzung des Fleisches" [reinstatement o f the flesh]! And the most horrifie d of all were the then ruling distinguishe d estates (there wer e as yet no classes in our country ) who could not live in Berlin an y more than on their countr y estates withou t constan t reinstatement o f their flesh! If only those good people had known Fourier, wh o contemplate d quite differen t pranks for the flesh! When utopianis m was supersede d these extravagance s yielded to a more rationa l and actuall y far more radical conception , and since Germany gre w out of Heine' s pious nurser y and develope d into a H.
Heine, "Zur Beruhigung".
— Ed.
b "Regeneratio n of the flesh".
— Ed.
the centr e of the socialis t movement , scorn has been poured upon the hypocritica l indignatio n of the distinguishe d pious world.
That is the entire conten t of the messages .
The rest consists in exhorting th e faithfu l to be zealous in propaganda , to courageou s and prou d confessio n of their faith in the face of the foe, to unrelenting struggl e against the enemy both within and without — and as far as this goes they could just as well have been written by one of the propheticall y minde d enthusiast s of the International .
Ill The message s are but the introductio n to the theme proper of John's communicatio n to the seven churche s of Asia Minor and through the m to what remaine d of reforme d Judais m in the year 69, out of which Christianit y later developed .
And herewit h we enter the innermos t holy of holies of early Christianity .
What kin d of people were the first Christian s recruite d from? Mainly fro m the "labourin g and burdened" , the member s of the lowest strata , as become s a revolutionar y element .
And what did they consis t of? In the towns of impoverishe d free men, all sorts of people, lik e the MEAN WHITE S of the souther n slave states and the European beachcomber s and adventurer s in colonia l and Chines e seaports, the n of freedme n and, above all, slaves; on the large estates i n Italy, Sicily, and Africa of slaves, and in the rural districts o f the province s of small peasant s who had fallen more and mor e into bondag e throug h debt.
There was absolutel y no common roa d to emancipatio n for all these elements .
For all of them paradis e lay lost behind them; for the ruined free men it was the forme r polis, the town and the state at the same time, of which their forefather s had been free citizens ; for the war-captiv e slaves the time of freedom before their subjugatio n and captivity ; for the small peasant s the abolishe d gentile social system and communa l landownership.
Al l that had been smitte n down by the levellin g iron fist of conquerin g Rome .
The larges t social group that antiquity ha d attaine d was the tribe and the union of kindre d tribes; among the barbarian s groupin g was based on alliance s of families an d among the town-foundin g Greek s and Italian s on the polis, which consiste d of one or more kindre d tribes.
Philip and Alexander gav e the Helleni c peninsul a politica l unity but that did not lead to the formatio n of a Greek nation .
Nation s becam e possible onl y throug h the downfal l of Roman world domination .
This dominatio n had put an end once and for all to the smalle r groups; militar y might, Roman jurisdictio n and the tax-collectin g machinery completel y dissolve d the traditiona l inner organisation .
To the loss of independenc e and distinctiv e organisatio n was added th e forcibl e plunde r by militar y and civil authoritie s who first too k the treasure s of the subjugate d away from them and then len t them back at usuriou s rates in order to extort still more out of them.
The pressur e of taxatio n and the need for money which it caused in region s with a purely or predominan t natura l economy plunge d the peasant s into ever deeper bondag e to the usurers, gav e rise to great difference s in fortune , making the rich richer an d the poor completel y destitute .
Any resistanc e by isolated smal l tribes or towns to the giganti c Roman world power was withou t prospect .
Where was the way out, salvation , for the enslaved, oppresse d and impoverished , a way out commo n to all these divers e groups of people whose interest s were mutuall y alien or even opposed ? And yet it had to be found if a great revolutionary movemen t was to embrac e them all.
This way out was found.
But not in this world.
As things were, it could only be a religiou s way out.
Then a new world was embraced.
Th e continue d life of the soul after the death of the body ha d graduall y becom e a recognise d article of faith through -out the Roman world.
A kind of recompens e or punishmen t of the decease d souls for their actions while on earth also receive d more an d more genera l recognition .
As far as recompens e was concerned, admittedly , the prospect s were not so good: antiquit y was too primitivel y materialisti c not to attribut e infinitel y greate r value to life on earth than to life in the shades ; to live on after death wa s considere d by the Greeks rather as a misfortune .
Then came Christianity , which took seriousl y recompens e and punish -ment in the world beyond and created heaven and hell, and a way out was found which would lead the labourin g and burdene d from thi s vale of woe to eternal paradise .
And in fact only with the prospect o f a reward in the world beyond could the stoico-philoni c renunciation o f the world and ascetic s be exalte d to the basic moral principl e of a new world religio n which would enthus e the oppressed masses .
But this heavenl y paradis e does not open itself to the faithful by the mer e fact of their death.
We shall see that the kingdo m of God, th e capita l of which is the New Jerusalem , can only be conquered an d opened up after arduou s struggle s with the powers of hell.
But the early Christian s believe d these struggle s lay in the immediate futur e ahead.
Our John describe s his book at the very beginning a s the revelatio n of "thing s which must shortly com e to pass"; and then immediately , 1:3, declare s "Blessed i s he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophec y .
.
.
for the time is at hand," To the churc h in Philadelphi a Chris t sends the message : "Behold, I come quickly.
" An d in the last chapter the angel says he has show n John "thing s which must shortly b e done" and gives him the order: "Seal no t the saying s of the prophec y of this book: for the time is at hand.
" And Chris t himsel f twice says ([22 :] 12, 20): "I come quickly.
" The seque l will show us how soon this coming was expected .
The vision s of the Apocalyps e which the author now shows us are copie d throughout , and mostly literally , from earlie r models , partly fro m the classica l prophet s of the Old Testament , particu -larly Ezekiel , partly from later Jewish apocalypse s written after the fashion o f the Book of Daniel and in particula r from the Book of Henoch whic h had alread y been written at least in part.
Criticis m has show n to the smalles t details where our John got every picture, ever y menacin g omen, every plague poured down upon unbelieving humanity , in a word, the whole of the materia l for his book; so that he not only shows great poverty of mind but actually proves himsel f that he never experience d even in the imaginatio n the allege d ecstasie s and visions he describes .
The orde r of these visions is briefly as follows : First John sees God sittin g on his throne holdin g in his hand a book with seven seals and before him the Lamb that has been slain and has risen from the dead (Christ ) and is found worthy to open the seals of the book .
The openin g of the seals is accompanie d by all sorts of miraculous menacin g signs.
When the fifth seal is opened John sees unde r the altar of God the souls of the martyr s of Christ that were slai n for the word of God and who cry with a loud voice saying: "How long , O Lord, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? " And the n white robes are given to them and they are told that they mus t rest for a little while yet, for more martyr s must be slain.
So here there is no mentio n of a "religio n of love", of "Love your enemies , bless them that curse you", etc.
Here undilute d revenge i s preached , sound, honest reveng e on the persecutor s of the Christians .
So it continue s throughou t the book.
The nearer the crisi s comes , the heavie r the plague s and punishment s rain from th e heaven s and with all the more satisfactio n John announces tha t the mass of humanit y will still not atone for their sins, that new scourge s of God must lash them, that Christ must rule the m with a rod of iron and tread the wine-pres s of the fierceness an d wrath of Almight y God, but that the impiou s still remain obdurat e in their hearts.
It is the natura l feeling , free of all hypocrisy , that a fight is going on and that— a la guerre comme à la guerre* When th e sevent h seal is opened there come seven angels with seven trumpet s and each time one of them sound s his trumpe t new horror s occur.
After the sevent h blast seven more angels come on to the scene with the seven vials of the wrath of God which the y pour out upon the earth; still more plague s and punishments, mainl y tediou s repetition s of what has alread y happened severa l times.
Then comes the woman , Babylo n the Great Whore , sitting arraye d in scarlet over the waters, drunk with the bloo d of the saints and the martyr s of Jesus, the great city of the seve n hills that rules over all the kings of the earth.
She is sitting o n a beast with seven heads and ten horns .
The seven heads represen t the seven hills, and also seven "kings" .
Of those kings fiv e are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come, and after him comes again one of the first five; he was wounde d to death bu t was healed .
He will reign over the world for 42 month s or 3V2 years (half of a week of seven years) and will persecut e the faithful t o death and bring the rule of.
godlessness .
But then follows th e great final fight, the saints and the martyr s are avenged b y the destructio n of the Great Whore Babylo n and all her followers , i.
e.
, the great mass of mankind ; the devil is cast into the bottomles s pit and shut up there for a thousan d years during which Chris t reigns with the martyr s risen from the dead.
But after a thousan d years the devil is freed again and there is anothe r great battl e of the spirits in which he is finally defeated .
Then follows th e second resurrection , when the other dead also arise and appea r before the throne of judgmen t of God (not of Christ, be it noted) and the faithfu l will enter a new heaven , a new earth, and a new Jerusale m for life eternal .
As this whole monumen t is made up of exclusivel y pre-Christia n Jewish materia l it present s almost exclusivel y Jewish ideas.
Since things starte d to go badly in this world for the people of Israel, from th e time of the tribute to the Assyrian s and Babylonians , from the destructio n of the two kingdom s of Israel and Judea to a In war as in war.
— Ed.
the bondag e under Seleucids , that is from Isaiah to Daniel, in every dark perio d there were prophecie s of a saviour.
In Daniel , 12 : 1-3, there is even a prophec y about Michael , the guardia n angel of the Jews, coming down on earth to deliver them from great trouble ; many dea d will awake again, there will be a kind of last judgmen t and the teacher s who have taught the people justice will shine like stars for all eternity .
The only Christia n point is the great stress laid on the imminen t reign of Christ and the glory of the faithful , particularly th e martyrs , who have risen from the dead.
For the interpretatio n of these prophecies , as far as they refer to events o f that time, we are indebte d to Germa n criticism , particularly Ewald, Lück e and Ferdinan d Benary .
It has been made accessibl e to non-theologian s by Renan.
We have alread y seen tha t Babylo n the Great Whore , stands for Rome, the city of seven hills .
We are told in 17:9-1 1 about the beast on which she sits: "The seve n heads " of the beast "are seven mountains , on which the woma n sitteth.
An d there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continu e a short space.
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth , and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
" According t o this the beast is Roma n world domination , represented b y seven caesar s in succession , one of them havin g been mortall y wounde d and no longer reigning , but he will be healed an d will return.
It will be given unto him as the eighth to establish th e kingdo m of blasphem y and defianc e of God.
It will be given unto him "to make war with the saints and to overcom e them.
.
.
.
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worshi p him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb.
.
.
.
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads : and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the numbe r of his name .
Here is wisdom .
Let him that hath understandin g count the numbe r of the beast : for it is the numbe r of a man; and his numbe r is Six hundre d threescor e and six" (13:7-18) .
We merel y note that boycot t is mentione d here as one of the measures t o be applie d agains t the Christian s by the Roma n Empire—and i s therefor e patentl y an inventio n of the devil—an d pass on to the questio n who this Roman empero r is who has reigned onc e before , was wounde d to death and eliminate d but will retur n as the eighth in the series in the role of the Antichrist .
Taking Augustu s as the first we have: 2.
Tiberius , 3.
Caligula , 4.
Claudius , 5.
Nero, 6.
Galba.
"Five ar e fallen, and one is.
" Hence, Ner o is already fallen and Galba is.
Galba ruled fro m June 9, 68 to Januar y 15, 69.
But immediatel y after he ascende d the thron e the legions of the Rhine revolte d under Vitelliu s while other general s prepare d for militar y risings in other provinces .
In Rome itsel f the praetorian s rose, killed Galba and proclaime d Otho emperor .
From thi s we see that our Revelatio n was written under Galba.
Probably toward s the end of his rule.
Or, at the latest, during the three month s (up to April 15, 69) of the rule of Otho, "the seventh".
Bu t who is the eighth , who was and is not? That we learn fro m the numbe r 666.
Among th e Semites—Chaldean s and Jews—ther e was at the time a kind of magic based on the double meanin g of letters .
From abou t 300 years B.
C.
Hebrew letter s were also used as symbols fo r numbers : a=l, b=2, g=3, d=4, etc.
The cabbal a diviners adde d up the value of each letter of a name like a sum of digits an d sought from the sum to prophes y the future of the one who bor e the name, e.
g.
, by formin g words or combination s of words o f equal value.
Secret words and the like were also expressed i n this languag e of numbers .
This art was given the Greek nam e gematriah, geometry ; the Chaldeans , who pursue d this as a busines s and were called mathematici b y Tacitus , were later expelled fro m Rome 3 under Claudiu s and again under Vitellius , presumably fo r "seriou s disorders" .
It was by means of this mathematic s that our numbe r 666 appeared.
Behin d it stands the name of one of the first five Roman emperors .
But besides the numbe r 666, Irenaeus , at the end of the second century , knew anothe r version—616 , which, at all events , appeared , at a time when the numbe r puzzle was still widely known.
b The proof of the solutio n will be if it holds good for both numbers .
This solutio n was provide d by Ferdinan d Benary of Berlin.
The name is Nero.
The numbe r is based on^Öp f *)^^t Neron Kesar, the Hebre w spellin g of the Greek Nerôn Kaisar, Emperor Nero , authenticated b y means of the Talmu d and Palmyria n inscrip -tions.
This inscriptio n was found on coins of Nero's time minted in the easter n half of the empire .
And so—n (nim) = 50; r (resh) = 200; v (vav) fo r o=6; n (mm)=50 ; k (kof)=\00; s (samekh) = 60; r (resh) = 200.
Tota l 666.
If we take as a basis the Latin spellin g Nero Caesar th e second nun = 50 disappear s and we get 666—5 0 = 616, which is Irenaeus ' reading .

In fact the whole Roman Empir e suddenl y broke into confusio n in Galba' s time.
Galba himself marche d on Rome at the head of the Spanis h and Gallic legions to overthro w Nero, who fled and ordered a freedma n to kill him.
But not only the praetorian s in Rome plotte d agains t Galba, the suprem e commander s in the provinces di d too; new pretender s to the thron e appeare d everywhere an d prepare d to march on Rome with their legions .
The empir e seeme d doome d to civil war, its dissolutio n appeare d imminent.
Ove r and above all this the rumou r spread , especiall y in the East, that Nero had not been killed but only wounded , that he had fled to the Parthian s and was about to advanc e with an army over the Euphrate s to begin anothe r and more bloody rule of terror.
Achai a and Asia in particula r were terrifie d by such reports.
An d at the very time at which the Revelatio n must have been writte n there appeare d a false Nero who settled with a fairly considerable numbe r of supporter s not far from Patmo s and Asia Minor o n the island of Kythno s in the Aegea n Sea (now called Thermia), unti l he was killed while Otho still reigned .
Little wonder tha t among the Christians , agains t whom Nero had launched th e first great persecution , the view sprea d that he would retur n as the Antichris t and that his return and the intensified attemp t at a bloody suppressio n of the new sect that it would involv e would be the sign and prelud e of the return of Christ, o f the great victoriou s struggl e agains t the powers of hell, of the thousand-yea r kingdo m "shortly " to be established , the confident expectatio n of which inspire d the martyr s to go joyfull y to their deaths .
Christian an d Christian-influence d literatur e in the first two centuries give s sufficien t indicatio n that the secret of the number 66 6 was then known to many.
Irenaeu s no longer knew it, but on the other hand he and many others up to the end of the third centur y also knew that the returnin g Nero was meant by the beast of the Apocalypse .
This trace is then lost and the work which interests u s is fantasticall y interprete d by religious-minde d future -tellers; I myself as a child knew old people who, followin g the example o f old Johann Albrecht Bengel , expected th e end of the world an d the last judgmen t in the year 1836.
The prophec y was fulfilled, an d to the very year.
The victim of the last judgment , however, wa s not the sinful world, but the pious interpreter s of the Revelatio n themselves .
For in 1836 F.
Benary provide d the key to the numbe r 666 and thus put a torturou s end to all the prophetical calculations , that new gematriah.
Our Joh n can only give a very superficia l descriptio n of the kingdom o f heaven that is reserve d for the faithful .
The new Jerusalem occupie s a fairly large area, at least accordin g to the conceptions o f the time: it is 12,000 furlongs , or 2,227 kilometre s broad, s o that its area is about five million square kilometres , more tha n half the size of the United States of America .
And it is built entirel y of gold and preciou s stones.
There God lives with his people, lightenin g them instea d of the sun, and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , neither shall there be any more pain.
And a pure river of water of life flows throug h the city, and on either sid e of the river are trees of life, bearing twelve manne r of fruits an d yieldin g fruit every month ; and the leaves of the tree "serve fo r the healin g of the heathens" .
(A kind of medicina l beverage, Renan thinks— L'Antéchrist, p .
542.
) Her e the saints shall live for ever.
Such, as far as we know, was Christianit y in Asia Minor, its main seat, aroun d the year 68.
No trace of any Trinit y but, on the contrary, th e old single and indivisibl e Jehova h of later Judais m which ha d exalte d him from the nationa l god of the Jews to the one and suprem e God of heaven and earth, where he claims to rule ove r all nations , promisin g mercy to the converte d and mercilessly smitin g down the obdurat e in accordanc e with the ancient parcere subjectis ac debellare superbos.
* Hence, this God, in person, no t Christ as in the later account s of the Gospel s and the Epistles, wil l presid e at the last judgment .
Accordin g to the Persian doctrin e of emanatio n which was curren t in later Judaism , Christ th e Lamb proceed s eternall y from him as do also, but on a lower footing , the "seven spirits of God" who owe their existenc e to a misunderstandin g of a poetical passage (Isaiah , 11:2).
All of them are subordinat e to God, not God themselve s or equal to him.
The Lam b sacrifice s itself to atone for the sins of the world and for that its status is considerabl y enhance d in heaven , for its voluntary martyrdo m is credite d as an extraordinar y feat through -out the book, not as somethin g which proceed s necessaril y from its intrinsic nature .
Naturall y the whole heavenl y court of elders , cherubim, angel s and saints is there.
In order to becom e a religion monotheism ha s always had to make concession s to polytheism — since the time of the Zend-Avesta.
428 With the Jews the decline to the sensuou s gods of the heathen s continue d chronicall y until, after th e exile, 429 the heavenl y court accordin g to the Persia n model adapte d religio n somewha t better to the imaginatio n of the masses, an d Christianit y itself, even after it had replace d the a Pardon the humbl e and make war on the proud.
— Ed.
eternally self-equa l immutabl e god of the Jews by the mysteriou s self-differentiating go d of the Trinity , could find nothin g to supplant th e worshi p of the old gods but that of the saints; thus, according t o Fallmerayer , the worshi p of Jupiter in Peloponnesus , Maina an d Arcadi a died out only about the ninth centur y (Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea, I, p.
227).
Only the moder n bourgeois perio d and its Protestantis m did away with the saints again an d at last took differentiate d monotheis m seriously .
In the book there is just as little mentio n of origina l sin and justification b y faith.
The faith of these early pugnaciou s communities i s quite differen t from that of the later victoriou s church: sid e by side with the sacrific e of the Lamb, the imminen t return o f Christ and the thousand-yea r kingdo m which is shortly to dawn form its essentia l content ; this faith survive s only throug h active propaganda , unrelentin g struggl e agains t the interna l and external enemy , the proud professio n of the revolutionar y standpoint befor e the heathe n judges and martyrdom , confiden t in victory .
We hav e seen that the autho r is not yet aware that he is something els e than a Jew.
Accordingl y there is no mentio n of baptism i n the whole book, just as many more facts indicat e that baptism wa s institute d in the second period of Christianity .
The 144,000 believin g Jews are "sealed" , not baptised .
It is said of the saints in heaven and the faithfu l upon earth that they had washed themselves o f their sins and washe d their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; there is no mentio n of the water of baptism .
The two prophet s who preced e the comin g of the Antichrist i n Chapte r 11 do not baptise ; and accordin g to 19: 10, the testimon y of Jesus is not baptism but the spirit of prophecy .
Baptism shoul d naturall y have been mentione d in all these cases if it had alread y been in vigour ; we may therefor e conclud e with almost absolut e certaint y that the author did not know of it, that it first appeare d when the Christian s definitivel y separate d from the Jews.
Neither doe s our author know any more about the second sacrament, Communion .
If in the Luthera n text Christ promise s every Thyatira n who remain s firm in the faith to take Commun -ion with him, this create s a false impression .
The Greek text has deipnêsô—I shal l eat suppe r (with him), and the Englis h bible translate s this correctly : I SHALL SUP WITH HIM.
There is no ques-tion her e of Communio n even as a mere commemoratio n meal.
There ca n be no doubt that this book, with its date so originall y 469 authenticated a s the year 68 or 69, is the oldest of all Christia n literature.
N o other is written in such barbari c language , so full of Hebraisms, awfu l construction s and grammatica l errors .
Chap-ter 1, verse 4, for example , says literally : "Grace b e unto you, and peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come.
" Only professiona l theologian s and other historian s who have a stake in it now deny that the Gospel s and the Acts of the Apostle s are but later adaptation s of writing s which are now lost and whose feeble historica l core is now unrecognisabl e in the maze of legend , that eve n the few Epistle s suppose d by Bruno Bauer to be "authentic" ar e either writing s of a later date a or at best adaptations o f old works of unknow n author s altered by addition s and insertions .
It is all the more importan t since we are here in possession o f a book whose date of writing has been determine d to the neares t month , a book that display s Christianit y to us in its most primitiv e form.
This form stands in the same relatio n to the fourth-century stat e religio n with its fully evolve d dogm a and mythology a s Tacitus ' still vacillatin g mytholog y of the German s does to the develope d teachin g of the gods of Edda430 as influence d by Christian an d ancien t elements .
The germ of the world religio n is there, bu t it include s withou t discriminatio n the thousan d pos-sibilities fo r developmen t which becam e realitie s in the countles s subsequent sects .
And the reason why this oldest writing of the time whe n Christianit y was coming into being is especiall y valuabl e for us is that it shows withou t any dilutio n what Judaism , strongly influence d by Alexandria , contribute d to Christianity .
All that come s later is western , Greco-Roma n appendage .
It was only by the intermediar y of the monotheisti c Jewish religio n that the culture d monotheis m of later Greek vulgar philosoph y could cloth e itself in the religiou s form in which alone it could grip the masses .
But once this intermediar y was found, it could become a world religio n only in the Greco-Roma n world, and that by furthe r developmen t in and merge r with the ideas of that world.
a In the Frenc h authorise d translation , publishe d in Le Devenir social, th e part of this sentenc e "that even the few Epistle s .

of a later date" reads: "that even thre e of four Epistle s still considere d authenti c by the Tübingen school are , as Bruno Baue r showe d in his penetratin g analysis , nothin g more than later writings.

These were, without doubt , poetic dreams .
But is there a modern poet so bold as to sing the idyllic life of the "free" worker s of present-da y Sicily?

We can do nothing agains t the dissolutio n of section s and societies .
But perhaps ou r testimon y will not be entirel y useless in the face of the odiou s and brazen slander s of an unofficia l and corrup t press.
This pres s reproache s the Italian socialist s with having deliber -ately simulate d Marxis t propaganda, 3 in order to hide a quite different politic s behind this mask, a politics which proclaim s the "class struggle " (somethin g that "would take us back to the Middle Ages") an d whose aim is to form a political party aspirin g to the "conquest o f power in the state"; wherea s the socialis t parties of other countries , and the German s in particular , "do not concer n themselves wit h politics , do not attack the form of the governmen t in power" , indeed they are simply harmles s good chaps and one can mak e jokes about them! If anyon e is being made a joke of here it is the Italian public .
One woul d never dare peddle them such stupiditie s if one did not take the m to be wholly ignoran t of what goes on in the world outside.

There is not a single one of all these partie s that does not aspire to the conquest o f public power, just as the other parties , the conserva -tives, liberals , republicans , etc.

As for the "class struggle" , it takes us back not just to the "Middle Ages " but to the interna l conflict s of the ancient republics : Athens, Sparta , Rome.
All those conflict s were class struggles .

479 [LETTER TO THE EDITOR S OF THE VORWÄRTS] According t o the Party press, in the agraria n debate of the Frankfurt Part y Congres s on Octobe r 25 Comrad e Vollma r cited the resolution s of the Frenc h Socialis t Congres s at Nantes, 442 "which hav e met with the explicit approval of Frederick Engels".
According t o the Vorwärts of Novembe r 10, this is also being spread aroun d by the hostile press.
443 I am therefor e forced to declare tha t there is an error here, and that Vollma r must be completely misinforme d with regard to me.
As far as I can recall, I have only sent two message s to France in relation t o the Nantes programme .
The first, before th e Congress , in reply to an enquir y by a French comrade, 3 stated in essence : the development o f capitalis m irrevocabl y destroy s the landholding s of the smal l peasantry .
Our Party is quite clear on this point, but it has absolutel y no occasio n to speed up this process even more by its own intervention .
There is nothin g to be said in principl e against properl y selecte d measure s designe d to make this inevita -ble fate less painful for the small peasantry ; if one goes further , if one wishe s to maintai n the small peasantr y in perpetuity , I am of the opinio n that one is strivin g for somethin g economicall y impossible, sacrificin g principle , becomin g reactionary .
The secon d message , after th e Congress , confine d itself to the assumption tha t our French friend s would stand alone in the socialist worl d with their attemp t to perpetuat e not only the small peasant proprietor s but also the small tenants exploitin g outsid e labour.

Thus, in so far as I have voiced any opinio n at all on the question, I have declare d the opposit e to what Vollma r was reported.
Once havin g becom e involve d in this matter, I find it difficul t to get out of it withou t expressin g myself more plainly .
I therefor e intend t o offer the Neue Zeit a short article outlinin g and explaining m y viewpoint.

481 THE PEASAN T QUESTIO N IN FRANC E AND GERMAN Y Written betwee n Novembe r 15 and 22, Printe d accordin g to the journa l 1894 First publishe d in Die Neue Zeit, Vol.
1, No.
10, 1894-189 5 Signed: Frederick Engels The bourgeoi s and reactionar y parties are feverishl y wonderin g why everywher e among socialist s the peasan t questio n has now suddenly bee n place d on the agenda .
What they shoul d be wondering at , by rights, is that this was not done long ago.
From Ireland t o Sicily, from Andalusi a to Russia and Bulgaria , the peasant i s a very essentia l factor of the population , productio n and political power .
Only two region s of Wester n Europ e form an exception.
I n Great Britai n prope r big lande d estate s and large-scale agricultur e have totally displace d the self-supportin g peasant; i n Prussi a east of the Elbe the same proces s has been going o n for centuries ; here too peasan t is being increasingl y "put down" 3 or at least economicall y and politicall y forced into the background.
The peasan t has so far largely manifeste d himsel f as a factor of political powe r only by his apathy , which has its roots in the isolation o f rustic life.
This apathy on the part of the great mass of the populatio n is the stronges t pillar not only of parliamentar y corruption i n Paris and Rome but also of Russian despotism .
Yet it is by no means insuperable .
Since the rise of the working-clas s movement i n Wester n Europe , especiall y in those parts where small peasan t holding s predominate , it has not been particularl y difficult fo r the bourgeoisi e to rende r the socialis t worker s suspicious an d odious in the minds of the peasant s as partageux, a s people wh o want to "divid e up", as lazy greedy city dweller s who a Wird "gelegt" Bauernlegen —a technica l term from Germa n history meanin g eviction, expropriatio n of peasants .
[Lenin' s note to his Russia n translatio n of the beginning o f Engels' work.
] have an eye on the propert y of the peasants .
The hazy socialis t aspirations o f the revolutio n of Februar y 1848 were rapidl y disposed o f by the reactionar y ballots of the French peasantry ; the peasant, wh o wanted peace of mind, dug up from his treasure d memories th e legend of Napoleon , the peasan t emperor , and created th e Second Empire .
We all know what this one feat of the peasants cos t the people of France ; it is still sufferin g from its consequences.
But muc h has change d since then.
The developmen t of the capitalist for m of productio n has cut the life-string s of small production i n agriculture ; small productio n is irretrievabl y going to rack and ruin.
Competitor s in North and South Americ a and in India, too , have swampe d the Europea n marke t with their cheap grain, so cheap that no domesti c produce r can compet e with it.
The big landowner s and small peasant s alike see ruin staring them in the face.
And since they are both owner s of land and countr y folk, the big landowner s assum e the role of champion s of the interests o f the small peasants , and the small peasant s by and large accept the m as such.
Meanwhile a powerfu l socialis t workers ' party has sprung up and develope d in the West.
The obscur e presentiment s and feelings datin g back to the Februar y revolutio n have becom e clarified an d acquire d the broade r and deepe r scope of a programme tha t meets all scientifi c requirement s and contain s definite tangibl e demands ; and a steadily growin g numbe r of socialist deputie s are fightin g for these demand s in the German , French an d Belgia n parliaments .
The conques t of politica l power by the socialis t party has becom e a matter of the foreseeabl e future.
Bu t in order to conque r politica l power this party must first go from the towns to the country , must become a power in the countryside .
This party, which has an advantag e over all others in that it possesse s a clear insight into the interconnection s between economi c causes and politica l effects and long ago spotted the wolf in the sheep' s clothin g of the big landowner , that importunate frien d of the peasant—ma y this party calmly leave the doome d peasan t in the hands of his false protector s until he has been transforme d from a passive into an active opponen t of the industria l workers ? This brings us right into the thick of the peasant question .
I The rura l populatio n to which we can addres s ourselve s consist s of quite differen t parts, which again vary greatly with the variou s regions.
In the West of Germany , as in Franc e and Belgium , there prevails th e small-scal e cultivatio n of small-holdin g peasants , the majority o f whom own and the minorit y of whom rent their plots of land.
In the Northwest—i n Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein — we have a preponderanc e of big and middle peasant s who cannot do withou t male and female farm servant s and even day labourers .
The sam e is true of part of Bavaria .
In Prussi a east of the Elbe and in Mecklenbur g we have the region.
of bi g landed estates and large-scal e cultivatio n with hinds, cotters an d day labourers , and in betwee n small and middl e peasants i n relativel y unimportan t and steadil y decreasin g propor -tion.
In centra l German y all these forms of productio n and owner -ship are found mixed in variou s proportions , dependin g upon the locality, withou t the clear prevalenc e of any particula r form over a large area .
Besides ther e are localitie s varyin g in extent where the arable land owne d or rented is insufficien t to provid e for the subsistenc e of the family , but can serve only as the basis for operatin g a domestic industr y and enablin g the latter to receive the otherwis e incomprehensibly lo w wages that ensure the steady sale of its products despit e all foreign competition .
Which o f these subdivision s of the rural populatio n can be won over by the Social-Democrati c Party? We, of course, investigat e this question onl y in broad outline ; we single out only clear-cu t forms.
We lack space to give consideratio n to intermediat e stages and mixed rura l populations .
Let us begin with the small peasant .
Not only is he, of all peasants, th e most importan t for Wester n Europ e in general , but he is also the critical case that decides the entire question .
Once we have clarifie d in our minds our attitud e to the small peasan t we have all the ground s needed to determin e our stand relativ e to the other constituen t parts of the rural population .
By smal l peasan t we mean here the owner or tenant — particularly th e former—o f a patch of land no bigger , as a rule, than he and his family can till, and no smaller than can sustain the family.
Thi s small peasant , just like the small handicraftsman , is 33-1550 therefore a toiler who differs from the moder n proletaria n in that he still possesse s his instrument s of labour ; hence a survival of a past mod e of production .
There is a threefol d differenc e betwee n him and his ancestor , the serf, bondma n or, very exceptionally , the free peasan t liable to rent and feudal services .
First, in that the French Revolutio n freed him from the feudal service s and dues that he owed to the landlor d and in the majorit y of cases, at least on the left bank of the Rhine, assigne d his peasan t farm to him as his own free property .
Second , in that he lost the protectio n of and the right to participat e in the self-administerin g Mark community, an d hence his share in the emolument s of the former common Mark .
The commo n Mark was whiske d away partly by the erstwhil e feudal lord and partly by enlightene d bureaucrati c legislation modelle d on Roma n law.
This deprive s the small peasant o f moder n times of the possibilit y of feedin g his draft animals withou t buying fodder .
Economically , however , the loss of the emolument s derive d from the Mark by far outweigh s the benefits accruin g from the abolitio n of feudal services .
The number o f peasant s unable to keep draft animal s of their own is steadily increasing .
Third, the peasan t of today has lost half of his former productiv e activity .
Formerl y he and his family produced , from raw materia l he had made himself , the greate r part of the industrial product s that he needed ; the rest of what he require d was supplie d by village neighbour s who plied a trade in additio n to farmin g and were paid mostly in article s of exchang e or in reciprocal services .
The family , and still more the village , was self-sufficient, produce d almos t everythin g it needed .
It was a natural econom y almost unalloyed ; almost no money was neces-sary.
Capitalis t productio n put an end to this by its money economy an d large-scal e industry .
But if the Mark emolument s represented on e of the basic condition s of his existence , his industrial sidelin e was another .
And thus the peasan t sinks ever lower.
Taxes , crop failures , division s of inheritanc e and litigation s drive on e peasan t after anothe r into the arms of the usurer ; the indebtedness become s more and more genera l and steadil y increases i n amoun t in each case—i n brief, our small peasant , like every othe r surviva l of a past mode of production , is hopelessl y doomed.
H e is a future proletarian .
As such he ought to lend a ready ear to socialis t propaganda .
But he is prevente d from doing so for the time being by his deep-rooted sens e of property .
The more difficul t it is for him to defend hi s endangere d patch of land the more desperatel y he clings to it, the more he regard s the Social Democrats , who speak of transferrin g landed propert y to the whole of society , just as dangerous a foe as the usure r and lawyer .
How is Social Democracy t o overcom e this prejudice ? What can it offer to the doomed smal l peasan t withou t becomin g untrue to itself? Here w e find a practica l point of suppor t in the agraria n programme o f the Frenc h socialist s of the Marxis t trend, a programme whic h is the more noteworth y as it comes from the classical lan d of small peasan t economy .
The Marseille s Congres s of 1892 adopte d the first agraria n programme o f the Party.
445 It demand s for propertyles s rural workers (tha t is to say, day labourer s and hinds) : minimu m wages fixed by trade unions and communit y councils ; rural trade courts consisting hal f of workers ; prohibitio n of the sale of communa l land; an d the leasing of public domain land to communitie s which are to rent out all this land, whethe r owned or leased by them, to associations o f propertyles s familie s of farm labourer s for commo n cultivation, o n conditio n that the employmen t of wage labourer s be prohibite d and that communitie s exercis e control ; old-age and invalid pensions , to be defraye d by means of a special tax on big landed estates .
On behal f of the small peasants, wit h specia l consideratio n to tenant farmers , it demands : acquisitio n of farm machiner y by the community t o be leased at a cost price to the peasants ; the formation o f peasan t co-operative s for the purchas e of manure , drain-pipes, seed , etc.
, and for the sale of the produce ; abolitio n of the real estate transfe r tax if the value involve d does not exceed 5,000 francs; arbitratio n commission s on the Irish patter n to reduce exorbitan t rents and compensat e quittin g tenant farmer s and sharecropper s (métayers) for the appreciatio n of the land due to them; repeal of Article 2102 of the Civil Code which allows a landlord t o impoun d the crop, and the abolitio n of the right of creditors t o levy on growin g crops; exemptio n from levy and distraint o f a definite amoun t of farm implement s and of the crop, seed, manure , draft animals , in short, whateve r is indispensabl e to the peasan t for carryin g on his business ; revisio n of the genera l cadastre, whic h has long been out of date, and until such time a local revisio n in each community ; lastly, free instructio n in farming, an d agricultura l experimenta l stations .
As we see, the demand s made in the interest s of the peasants—those mad e in the interest s of the worker s do not concern u s here for the time being—ar e not very far-reaching .
Some of them have alread y been implemente d elsewhere .
The tenants' arbitratio n courts refer explicitl y to the Irish prototype .
33* Peasant co-operative s alread y exist in the Rhine provinces .
The revision o f the cadastr e has constantl y been a pious wish of all liberals an d even bureaucrat s throughou t Wester n Europe .
The other points , too, could be carrie d into effect withou t any substantial impairmen t of the existin g capitalis t order.
So much simply i n characterisatio n of the programme .
No reproac h is intended; quit e the contrary .
The Part y did such good busines s with this programm e among the peasant s in the most divers e parts of France that—sinc e appetite come s with eating— a need was felt to adapt it still more to their taste.
The feelin g was, however , that this would be treading o n dangerou s ground .
How was the peasan t to be helped , not the peasan t as a future proletaria n but as a propertie d peasan t of the presen t time, withou t violatin g the basic principle s of the general socialis t programme ? In order to meet this objectio n the new practica l proposal s were preface d by a theoretica l preambl e which seek s to prove that it is in keepin g with the principle s of socialism t o protect small-peasan t propert y from destructio n by the capitalist mod e of productio n althoug h one is perfectl y aware that this destructio n is inevitable .
Let us now examin e more closely this preamble a s well as the demand s themselves , which were adopte d by the Nantes Congres s in Septembe r of this year.
The preambl e begins as follows : "Whereas accordin g to the terms of the genera l programm e of the Party producers ca n be free only in so far as they are in possessio n of the means of production; "Whereas i n the sphere of industr y these means of productio n have alread y reached suc h a degree of capitalis t centralisatio n that they can be restore d to the producers onl y in collectiv e or social form, but—a t least in present-da y France—this i s by no means the case in the sphere of agriculture , the means of production, namel y the land, being in very many localitie s still in the hands of the individual producer s themselve s as their individua l property ; "Whereas eve n this state of affairs characterise d by small-holdin g ownershi p is irretrievably doome d (est fatalement appelé à disparaître), still it is not for socialis m to hasten thi s doom, as its task does not consist in separatin g propert y from labou r but, on the contrary , in uniting both of these factors of all productio n by placing them in the same hands, factors whose separatio n entails the servitud e and povert y of the worker s reduce d to proletarians ; "Whereas, o n the one hand, it is the duty of socialis m to put the agricultura l proletarians agai n in possession—collectiv e or social in form—o f the great domain s after expropriatin g their presen t idle owners , it is, on the other hand, no less its imperative dut y to maintai n the peasant s themselve s tilling their patches of land in possession o f the same as against the treasury , the usurer , and the encroachment s of the newly arisen big landowners ; "Whereas i t is expedien t to extend this protectio n also to the producer s who as tenants o r sharecropper s (métayers) cultivate th e land owned by others and who, if they exploi t day labourers , are to a certain extent compelle d to do so by the exploitation t o which they themselve s are subjected — "Therefore th e Workers ' Party—whic h unlike the anarchist s does not count on an increas e and spread of poverty for the transformatio n of the social order but expects labou r and society in genera l to be emancipate d only by the organisatio n and concerte d efforts of the worker s of both countr y and town, by their taking possession o f the governmen t and legislation—ha d adopte d the followin g agraria n programme i n order to bring togethe r all the element s of rural production , all occupations whic h by virtue of various rights and titles utilise the nationa l soil, to wage an identica l struggl e agains t the commo n foe: the feudalit y of landowner -ship.
" Now for a closer examinatio n of these "whereas" .
To begi n with, the statemen t in the French programm e that freedom o f the producer s presuppose s the possessio n of the means o f productio n must be supplemente d by those immediatel y following: tha t the possessio n of the means of productio n is possible onl y in two forms: either as individua l possession , which form neve r and nowher e existed for the producer s in general , and is daily being made more impossibl e by industria l progress ; or else as commo n possession , a form the materia l and intellectua l preconditions o f which have been establishe d by the developmen t of capitalis t society itself; that therefor e taking collective possessio n of the means of productio n must be fought for by all means at the disposal o f the proletariat .
The commo n possessio n of the means of productio n is thus set forth her e as the sole principa l goal to be striven for.
Not only in industry, wher e the groun d has alread y been prepared , but in general, henc e also in agriculture .
Accordin g to the programm e individual possessio n never and nowher e obtaine d generall y for all producers; fo r that very reason and becaus e industria l progres s removes i t anyhow , socialis m is not intereste d in maintaining , but rather in removing , it; becaus e where it exists and in so far as it exists it makes commo n possessio n impossible .
Once we cite the programme i n suppor t of our contention , we must cite the entire programme, whic h considerabl y modifie s the propositio n quote d in Nante s by makin g the universa l historica l truth expresse d in it dependent upo n the condition s under which alone it can remain a truth toda y in Wester n Europ e and North America .
Possession o f the mean s of productio n by the individua l producers nowaday s no longer grants these producer s any real freedom.
Th e handicraft s have already been ruined in the cities; in metropolise s like Londo n they have even disappeare d entirely , having bee n replace d by large-scal e industry , the sweatsho p system an d miserabl e bungler s who thrive on bankruptcy .
The self-supporting smal l peasan t is neither in the safe possessio n of his tiny patch of land nor is he free.
He, as well as his house, his farmstead an d his few fields belong to the usurer ; his livelihoo d is more uncertai n than that of the proletarian , who at least does have tranqui l days now and then, which is never the case with the tortured deb t slave.
Strike out Article 2102 of the Civil Code, provide b y law that a definite amoun t of a peasant' s farm implements, livestock , etc.
, shall be exemp t from levy and distraint; ye t you canno t ensure him agains t an emergenc y in which he is compelle d to sell his cattle "voluntarily" , in which he must sig n himsel f away body and sole to the usurer and be glad to get a reprieve .
Your attemp t to protec t the small peasan t in his property doe s not protect his liberty but only the particula r form of his servitude ; it prolong s a situation in which he can neithe r live nor die.
It is, therefore , entirely out of place here to cite the first paragraph o f your programme .
The preambl e states that in present-da y France the means of production, tha t is, the land, is in very many localitie s still in the hands of individua l producer s as their individua l possession ; that, however, it is not, so it continues , the task of socialis m to separat e property fro m labour , but, on the contrary , to unite these two factors o f all productio n by placing them in the same hands.
—A s has alread y been pointe d out, the latter in this genera l form is by no mean s the task of socialism .
The latter's task is rather only to transfer th e means of productio n to the producer s as their common possession.
A s soon as we lose sight of this the above statemen t becomes directl y misleadin g in that it implies it is the missio n of socialism t o conver t the presen t sham propert y of the small peasant i n his fields into real property , that is to say, to conver t the smal l tenant into an owner and the indebte d owner into a debtless owner .
Undoubtedl y socialis m is intereste d to see that the false semblanc e of peasan t propert y should disappear , but not in this manner .
At any rate we have now got so far that the preambl e can straightforwardly declar e it to be the duty of socialism , indeed, its imperative duty , "to maintai n the peasant s themselve s tilling their patche s of land in possessio n of the same as against the treasury , the usurer, and the encroachment s of the newly arisen bi g landowners" .
The preambl e thus impose s upon socialis m the imperativ e duty to carry out somethin g which it had declare d to be impossibl e in the precedin g paragraph .
It charge s it to "maintain " the small-holding ownershi p of the peasant s althoug h it itself states The Peasan t Questio n in France and German y 49 1 that this form of ownershi p is "irretrievabl y doomed" .
What are the treasury , the usurer and the newly arisen big landowner s if not the instrument s by means of which capitalis t productio n brings about thi s inevitabl e doom? What means "socialism " is to employ to protec t the peasan t against this trinity we shall see below.
But not only the small peasant is to be protecte d in his property .
It is likewis e "expedient t o extend this protectio n also to the producer s who as tenants or sharecroppers (métayers) cultivate th e land owned by others and who, if they exploit day labourers , are to a certain extent compelle d to do so by the exploitatio n to which the y themselve s are subjected" .
Here we are enterin g upon peculia r ground indeed .
Socialis m is particularly oppose d to the exploitatio n of wage labour .
And here it is declare d to be the imperativ e duty of socialis m to protec t the French tenant s when they "exploit da y labourers" , to quote the text verbatim ! And that becaus e they are compelle d to do so to a certain exten t "by the exploitatio n to which they themselve s are subjected"! How eas y and pleasan t it is to keep on coastin g once you are on the tobogga n slide! When the big and middl e peasant s of Germany no w come to ask the French socialist s to interced e with the Germa n Party Executiv e to get the Germa n Social-Democrati c Party to protec t them in the exploitatio n of their male and female farm servants , citing in suppor t of their contentio n the "exploita -tion to which they themselve s are subjected " by usurers , tax collectors, grai n speculator s and cattle dealers , what will they answer? Wha t guarante e have they that our agraria n big landlord s will not send them Coun t Kanitz (as he also submitte d a proposa l like their s providin g for a state monopol y in grain importation ) and likewis e ask for socialis t protectio n of their exploitatio n of the rural workers , citing in suppor t "the exploitatio n to which they themselves ar e subjected " by stock-jobbers , money lender s and grain speculators ? Let us say here at the outset that the intention s of our French friends ar e not as bad as one would suppose .
The above paragraph, w e are told, is intende d to cover only a quite special case, namely the following : In Norther n France , just as in our sugar-beet districts , land is leased to the peasant s oblige d to cultivate beet s on condition s which are extremel y onerous .
They must delive r the beets to a stated factory at a price fixed by it, must buy definit e seed, use a fixed quantit y of prescribe d fertilise r and on deliver y are badly cheate d into the bargain .
We are only too familia r with this in German y as well.
But if this sort of peasant i s to be taken under one's wing this must be said openly and explicitly .
As the sentenc e reads now, in its unlimite d genera l form, it is a direct violatio n not only of the French programm e but also of the fundamenta l principl e of socialis m in general , and its authors wil l have no cause for complain t if this careles s piece of editing i s used agains t them in variou s quarter s contrar y to their intention.
Also capabl e of such misconstructio n are the concludin g words of the preambl e accordin g to which it is the task of the Socialis t Workers' Part y "to bring togethe r all the element s of rural production , all occupation s which by virtue o f variou s rights and titles utilise the nationa l soil, to wage an identica l struggle agains t the commo n foe: the feudalit y of landownership" .
I flatly deny that the socialis t workers ' party of any countr y is charged wit h the task of taking into its fold, in additio n to the rural proletarian s and the small peasants , also the middle and big peasants an d perhap s even the tenants of big estates , the capitalis t cattle breeder s and the other capitalis t exploiter s of the nationa l soil.
To all of them the feudalit y of landownershi p may appear to be a commo n foe.
On certain question s we may make commo n cause wit h them and be able to fight for some time on their side for definit e aims.
True, we can use in our Party individual s from every clas s of society , but we have no use whateve r for any groups representing capitalist , middle-bourgeoi s or middle-peasan t inter-ests.
Here too what they mean is not as bad as it looks.
The authors evidentl y never even gave all this a thought .
But unfortunately the y allowe d themselve s to be carried away by their zeal for generalisatio n and they must not be surprise d if they are taken at their word.
After th e preambl e come the newly adopte d addend a to the programme itself.
They betray the same cursor y editin g as the preamble.
The articl e providin g that the communitie s must acquire farm machinery an d lease it at prime cost to the peasant s is modifie d so as to provid e that the communitie s are, in the first place, to receive stat e subsidie s for this purpos e and, secondly , that the machinery i s to be placed at the disposa l of the small peasant s free of charge .
This further concessio n will not be of much avail to the small peasants , whose fields and mode of productio n permit of but little use of machinery .
Furthermore, "substitution o f a single progressiv e tax on all income s upward of 3,000 francs for all existin g direct and indirec t taxes".
A simila r deman d has been include d for many years in almost every Social-Democrati c programme .
But that this deman d is raised especiall y in the interest s of the small peasant s is somethin g new and shows only how little its real scope has been calculated .
Take England .
There the state budge t amount s to 90 millio n pounds sterling , of which I3V2 to 14 million are accounte d for by income tax .
The smalle r part of the remainin g 76 million is contributed b y taxing busines s (post and telegrap h charges , stamp tax), but by far greate r part of it impost s on article s of mass consumption, b y constantl y repeate d clippin g of small, impercepti -ble amoun t totallin g many million s from the income s of all members o f the population , but particularl y of its poorer sections .
In present-da y societ y it is scarcel y possibl e to defray state expenditures i n any other way.
Suppos e the whole 90 million are saddled i n Englan d on the income s of 120 pound s sterling=3,00 0 francs an d in excess thereo f by the impositio n of a progressiv e direct tax .
The averag e annual accumulation , the annual increas e of the aggregat e nationa l wealth , amounte d in 1865 to 1875, according t o Giffen, to 240 million pound s sterling .
Let us assume it now equals 300 million annually ; a tax burde n of 90 million would consum e almost one-thir d of the aggregat e accumulation .
In othe r words , no governmen t excep t a socialis t one can undertake an y such thing.
When the socialist s are at the helm there wil l be things for them to carry into executio n alongsid e which tha t tax refor m will figure as a mere, and quite insignificant, settlemen t for the momen t while altogethe r differen t prospects ope n up to the small peasants .
There seem s to be a realisatio n that the peasant s will have to wait rathe r a long time for this tax reform so that "in the meantime" (en attendant) th e followin g prospec t is held out to them: "abolition o f taxes on land for all peasant s living by their own labour , and reduction o f these taxes on all mortgage d plots" .
The latte r half of this deman d can refer only to peasan t farms too big t o be operate d by the family itself; hence it is again a provision i n favour of peasant s who "exploi t day labourers" .
Again: "freedom o f huntin g and fishing withou t restrictio n other than such as may be necessary fo r the conservatio n of game and fish and the protectio n of growin g crops".
This sound s very popular , but the concludin g part of the sentence wipe s out the introductor y part.
How many hares , partridges, pike s and carp are there even today per peasan t family in all the rural localities ? Would you say more than would warran t giving eac h peasan t just one da y a year for free huntin g and fishing? "Lowering o f the legal and conventiona l rate of interest" — hence renewe d usury laws, a renewe d attemp t to introduc e a police measur e that has always failed everywher e for the last two thousand years .
If a small peasan t finds himsel f in a position where recours e to a usurer is the lesser evil to him, the usurer will always fin d ways and means of suckin g him dry withou t falling foul of the usury laws.
This measur e could serve at most to soothe the smal l peasan t but he will derive no advantag e from it; on the contrary, i t makes it more difficul t for him to obtain credit precisely whe n he needs it most.
"Medical treatmen t free of charge and medicine s at cost price" — this at any rate is not a measur e for the special protectio n of the peasants.
Th e Germa n programm e goes further and demand s that medicine to o should be free of charge .
"Compensation fo r familie s of reservist s called up for militar y duty for the duration o f their service " — this alread y exists, though most inadequately , in German y and Austria an d is likewis e no special peasan t demand .
"Lowering o f the transpor t charge s for fertilise r and farm machiner y and produce"— is on the whole in effect in Germany , and mainl y in the interests—of th e big landowners .
"Immediate preparator y work for the elaboratio n of a plan of public works for the amelioratio n of the soil and the advancemen t of agricultura l production " — leaves everythin g in the realm of uncertaint y and fine-soundin g promises an d is also above all in the interes t of the big landed estates.
In brief, after the tremendou s theoretica l effort exhibite d in the preamble th e practica l proposal s of the new agraria n programm e are even more unrevealin g as to the way in which the Frenc h Workers' Part y expect s to be able to maintai n the small peasant s in possession o f their smallholding s which, on its own testimony , are irretrievably doomed .
II In one point our French comrade s are absolutel y right: No lasting revolutionar y transformatio n is possibl e in France against the will of the small peasant .
Only it seems to me they have not got the right leverag e if they mean to lay hold of the peasant .
They ar e bent, it seems, on winnin g over the small peasan t forthwith, possibl y even for the next genera l elections .
This they can hope to achiev e only by making very risky genera l assurance s in defenc e of which they are compelle d to set forth even much more risk y theoretica l considerations .
Then, upon closer examina -tion, it appears that the genera l assurance s are self-contradictor y (promise t o maintai n a state of affairs which , as one declare s oneself, is irretrievabl y doomed ) and that the various measure s are either wholl y withou t effect (usury laws), or are genera l workers ' demands o r demand s which also benefi t the big landowner s or finally ar e such of no great bearing at all on the interest s of the small peasants .
In consequence , the directl y practica l part of the programme o f itself correct s the erroneou s initial part and reduce s the apparentl y formidabl e grandiloquenc e of the preambl e to actually innocen t proportions .
Let us say it outright : in view of the prejudice s arising out of their entir e economi c position , their upbringin g and their isolated mode of life, prejudice s nurture d by the bourgeoi s press and the big landowners , we can win over the mass of the small peasant s forthwith onl y if we make them a promise which we ourselve s know we shall not be able to keep.
That is, we must promis e them not only to protec t their propert y in any event agains t all economic force s sweepin g over them but also to relieve them of the burden s which alread y now oppres s them: to transfor m the tenant int o a free owner and to pay the debts of the owner succumbing t o the weight of his mortgage .
If we could do this we should agai n arrive at the point from which the presen t situatio n would necessaril y develo p anew.
We shall not have emancipate d the peasan t but only given him a reprieve .
But it is not in our interest s to win over the peasan t overnigh t only to lose him again on the morro w if we cannot keep our promise.
W e have no more use for the peasan t as a Party membe r if he expect s us to perpetuat e his propert y in his smallholdin g than for the small handicraftsma n who would fain be perpetuate d as a boss.
These people belong to the anti-Semites .
Let them go to them an d let them get the promis e to salvag e their small enterprises.
Onc e they learn there what these glitterin g phrase s really amoun t to and what melodie s are fiddled down from the anti-Semitic heaven s they will realise in ever-increasin g measur e that we who promis e less and look for salvatio n in entirel y different quarter s are after all more reliabl e people .
If the French had the striden t anti-Semiti c demagog y we have they would hardly have committe d the mistak e at Nantes .
What, then , is our attitud e toward s the small peasants ? How shall we have to deal with them on the day of our accessio n to power? To begin with, the French programm e is absolutel y correc t in stating: tha t we foresee the inevitabl e doom of the small peasan t but that it is not our mission to hasten it by any interferenc e on our part .
Secondly, it is just as eviden t that when we are in possessio n of state powe r we shall not even think of forcibly expropriatin g the small peasant s (whethe r with or withou t compensation) , as we shall have to do in the case of the big landowners .
Our task relativ e to the smal l peasan t consists , in the first place, in effectin g a transition o f his privat e undertaking , privat e propert y to a co-operative one , not forcibl y but by dint of exampl e and the proffer o f social assistanc e for this purpose .
And then of course we shall have ample means of showin g to the small peasan t prospective advantage s that must be obviou s to him even today.
Almost twent y years ago the Danish socialists , who have only one real city in their country—Copenhagen—an d therefor e have to rely almos t exclusivel y on peasan t propagand a outsid e of it, were alread y drawin g up such plans.
The peasant s of a village or parish — there are many big individua l homestead s in Denmark — were to pool their land to form a single big farm in order to cultivate i t for commo n accoun t and distribut e the yield in proportion t o the land, money and labou r contributed .
In Denmark smal l landed propert y plays only a secondar y role.
But if we apply this idea to a region of smallholding s we shall find that if these ar e pooled and the aggregat e area cultivate d on a large scale, par t of the labour power employe d hithert o is rendere d superfluous.
I t is precisel y this saving of labour that represent s one of the main advantage s of large-scal e farming .
Employmen t for this labour power can be found in two ways.
Either additiona l land take n from big estates in the neighbourhoo d is placed at the disposal o f the peasan t co-operativ e or the peasant s in questio n are provided wit h the means and opportunit y to engage in industria l sidelines, primaril y and as far as possibl e for their own use.
In either cas e their economi c positio n is improve d and simultaneousl y the genera l social directin g agenc y is assure d the necessar y influence t o graduall y transfor m the peasan t co-operativ e to a higher form , and to balanc e the rights and duties of the co-operative a s a whole as well as of its individua l member s with those of the other department s of the entire community .
How this is to be carried out in practic e in each particula r case will depend upon th e circumstance s of the case and the condition s under which w e take possessio n of politica l power.
We may thus possibl y be in a position to offer these co-operative s yet further advan -tages: assumptio n of their entire mortgag e indebtednes s by the national ban k with a simultaneou s sharp reductio n of the interes t rate; advance s from publi c funds for the establishmen t of large-scale productio n (to be made not necessaril y or primaril y in money bu t in the form of require d products : machinery , artificia l fertiliser, etc.
) , and other advantage s besides .
The mai n point is and will be to make the peasant s understan d that we can save, preserv e their houses and fields for them only by transforming the m into co-operativ e propert y operate d co-operatively.
I t is precisel y the individua l farmin g conditione d by individual ownershi p that drives the peasant s to their doom.
If they insis t on individua l operatio n they will inevitabl y be driven from hous e and home and their antiquate d mode of productio n superseded b y capitalis t large-scal e production .
That is how the matter stands .
Now we come along and offer the peasant s the opportunity o f introducin g large-scal e productio n themselves , not for accoun t of the capitalist s but for their own, commo n account .
Should i t really be impossibl e to make the peasant s understan d that this is in their own interest , that it is the sole means of their salvation? Neither no w nor at any time in the future can we promis e the smallholding peasant s to preserv e their individua l propert y and individual enterpris e agains t the overwhelmin g power of capitalis t production.
W e can only promis e them that we shall not interfer e in their propert y relation s by force, against their will.
Moreover , we can advocat e that the struggl e of the capitalist s and big landlords agains t the small peasant s should be waged even now with a minimu m of unfair means and that direct robber y and cheating, whic h are practise d only too often, be as far as possibl e prevented.
I n this we shall succee d only in exceptiona l cases.
Under th e develope d capitalis t mode of productio n nobod y can tell wher e honest y ends and cheatin g begins .
But always it will make a considerabl e differenc e whethe r public authorit y is on the side of the cheate r or the cheated .
We of course are decidedl y on the side of the small peasant ; we shall do everythin g at all permissible t o make his lot more bearable , to facilitat e his transition t o the co-operativ e should he decide in favour of it, and even to make it possibl e for him to remain on his smallholdin g for a protracte d length of time to think the matter over, should he still be unable to bring himsel f to this decision .
We do this not only becaus e we conside r the small peasan t living by his own labour a s virtuall y belongin g to us, but also in the direct interest of the Party .
The greate r the numbe r of peasant s whom we can save from bein g actuall y hurled down into the proletariat , whom we can win over to our side while they are still peasants , the more quickly an d easily the social transformatio n will be accomplished .
It will serve us nough t to wait with this transformatio n until capitalist productio n has develope d everywher e to its utmos t conseqences, unti l the last small handicraftsma n and the last small peasant hav e fallen victim to capitalis t large-scal e production .
The material sacrific e to be made for this purpos e in the interes t of the peasants an d to be defraye d out of public funds can, from the point of view of capitalis t economy , appear only as money thrown away, bu t it is nevertheles s an excellen t investmen t becaus e it will effect a perhaps tenfold saving in the cost of the social reorganisa -tion in general .
In this sense we can, therefore , afford to deal very liberally wit h the peasants .
This is not the place to go into details , to make concret e proposal s to that end; here we can deal only with genera l principles .
Accordingly w e can do no greate r disservic e to the Party as well as to the small peasant s than to make promise s that even so much as create the impressio n that we intend to preserv e the small-holdings permanently .
It would mean directl y to block the way of the peasant s to their emancipatio n and to degrad e the Party to the level of rowdy anti-Semitism .
On the contrary , it is the duty of our Party to make clear to the peasant s again and again that their position i s absolutel y hopeles s as long as capitalis m holds sway, that it is absolutel y impossibl e to preserv e their smallholding s for them as such, that capitalis t large-scal e productio n is absolutel y sure to run over their impoten t antiquate d system of small production a s a train runs over wheelbarrow .
If we do this we shall act in conformit y with the inevitabl e trend of economi c development, an d this developmen t will not fail to bring our words hom e to the small peasants .
Incidentally, I cannot leave this subject withou t expressin g my conviction tha t the author s of the Nante s programm e are also essentially o f my opinion .
Their insight is much too great for them not to know that areas now divide d into smallholding s are also bound t o becom e commo n property .
They themselve s admit that smallholding ownershi p is destine d to disappear .
The report of the Nationa l Counci l drawn up by Lafargu e and delivere d at the Congress o f Nantes likewis e fully corroborate s this view.
It has been publishe d in Germa n in the Berlin Sozialdemokrat of October 1 8 of this year.
3 The contradictor y natur e of the expressions use d in the Nantes programm e itself betrays the fact that wha t the author s actuall y say is not what they mean to say.
If they are not understoo d and their statement s misused , as actually has alread y happened , that is of course their own fault.
At any rate, they will have to elucidat e their programm e and the next French congres s revise it thoroughly .
We now come to the bigger peasants .
Here as a result of the divisions o f inheritanc e as well as of indebtednes s and forced sales of land we find a variegate d patter n of intermediat e stages, from smallholding peasan t to big peasan t proprietor , who has retaine d his old patrimon y intact or even added to it.
Where the middle peasant live s among smallholdin g peasant s his interest s and views will not differ greatl y from theirs ; he knows from his own experience ho w many of his kind have already sunk to the level of small peasants .
But where middle and big peasant s predominat e and the operatio n of the farms requires , generally , the help of male and female servant s it is quite a differen t matter .
Of course a workers' part y has to fight, in the first place, on behalf of the wage workers , that is, for the male and female servant s and the day labourers .
It is thus unquestionabl y forbidde n to make any promises t o the peasant s which includ e the continuanc e of the wage slaver y of the workers .
But as long as the big and middl e peasants continu e to exist as such they canno t manag e withou t wage workers .
If it would, therefore , be downrigh t folly on our part to hold out prospect s to the smallholdin g peasant s of continuing permanentl y to be such, it would borde r on treaso n were we to promis e the same to the big and middl e peasants .
We have here again the paralle l case of the handicraftsme n in the cities .
True, they are more ruined than the peasant s but there still are some who employ journeyme n in additio n to apprentice s or for whom apprentice s do the work of journeymen .
Let those of these maste r craftsme n who want to perpetuat e their existenc e as such cas t in their lot with the anti-Semite s until they have convinced themselve s that they get no help in that quarter either.
The rest , who have realise d that their mode of productio n is inevitably doomed , are comin g over to us and, moreover , are ready in future to share the lot that is in store for all other a P.
Lafargue , "Das bauerlich e Eigentu m und die ökonomisch e Entwicklung.
" — Ed.
workers.
Th e same applies to the big and middle peasants .
It goes without sayin g that we are more intereste d in their male and female servant s and day labourer s than in them themselves .
If these peasant s want to be guarantee d the continue d existenc e of their enterprise s we are in no positio n whateve r to assure them of that.
The y must then take their place among the anti-Semites , peasant leaguer s and simila r parties who derive pleasur e from promising everythin g and keepin g nothing .
We are economicall y certain tha t the big and middl e peasan t must likewis e inevitabl y succumb t o the competitio n of capitalis t productio n and the cheap overseas corn , as is proved by the growin g indebtednes s and the everywhere eviden t decay of these peasant s as well.
We can do nothing agains t this decay except recommen d here too the poolin g of farms to form co-operativ e enterprises , in which the exploita -tion of wage labour will be eliminate d more and more, and their gradual transformatio n into branche s of the great nationa l producers' co-operative s with each branch enjoyin g equal rights and dutie s can be instituted .
If these peasant s realise the inevitability o f the doom of their presen t mode of productio n and draw the necessar y conclusion s they will come to us and it will be incumbent upo n us to facilitat e to the best of our ability also their transition t o the change d mode of production .
Otherwis e we shall have to abando n them to their fate and addres s ourselve s to their wage workers , among whom we shall not fail to find sympathy .
Most likel y we shall be able to abstain here as well from resortin g to forcibl e expropriation , and as for the rest to count on future economic development s making even these more stubbor n charac -ters amenabl e to reason .
Only the big landed estates presen t a perfectly simple case.
Here we are dealin g with undisguise d capitalis t productio n and no scruples o f any sort need restrai n us.
Here we are confronte d by rural proletarian s in masses and our task is clear.
As soon as our Party is in possessio n of politica l power it has simply to expropriate th e big landed proprietor s just like the manufacturer s in industry .
Whethe r this expropriatio n is to be compensate d for or not will to a great extent depen d not upon us but the circumstances unde r which we obtain power , and particularl y upon th e attitud e adopte d by these gentry , the big landowners , themselves.
W e by no means conside r compensatio n as impermissi -ble in any event; Marx told me (and how many times!) that in his opinion w e would get off cheapes t if we could buy out the whole lot of them.
But this does not concer n us here.
The big estates thus restore d to the communit y are to be turned over by us to the rural worker s who are alread y cultivatin g them and are to be organised int o co-operatives .
They are to be assigne d to them for their use and benefit under the control of the community .
Nothin g can as yet be stated as to the terms of their tenure.
At any rate the transformation o f the capitalis t enterpris e into a social enterpris e is here full y prepare d for and can be carrie d into executio n overnight, precisel y as in Mr.
Krupp' s or Mr.
von Stumm' s factory .
And th e exampl e of these agricultura l co-operative s would convince eve n the last of the still resistan t small-holdin g peasants , and surel y also many big peasants , of the advantage s of co-operative, large-scal e production .
Thus w e can open up prospect s here befor e the rural proletarians a s splendi d as those facing the industria l workers , and it can be only a question of time, and of only a very short time, before w e win over to our side the rural worker s of Prussia east of the Elbe .
But once we have the East-Elb e rural worker s a differen t wind wil l blow at once all over Germany .
The actual semi-servitude o f the East-Elb e rural worker s is the main basis for the domination o f Prussia n Junkerdom and thu s for the speciall y Prussian overlordshi p in Germany .
It is the Junker s east of the Elbe wh o have create d and preserve d the specificall y Prussia n character o f the bureaucrac y as well as of the body of army officers—the Junkers , who are being reduce d more and more to ruin by their indebtedness , impoverishmen t and parasitis m at state and privat e cost and for that very reaso n cling the more desperately t o the dominio n which they exercise ; the Junkers , whose haughtiness , bigotr y and arroganc e have brough t the German Empir e of the Prussia n nation within the country into such hatred—even whe n every allowanc e is made for the fact that at present thi s Empire is inevitabl e as the sole form in which nationa l unity can now be attained—an d abroad so little respect despite its brilliant victories .
The power of these Junker s is grounde d on the fact that within the compac t territor y of the seven old Prussia n provinces—that is , approximatel y one-thir d of the entire territor y of the Empire—the y have at their disposa l the landed property , which her e brings with it both social and politica l power; and not only the landed propert y but, throug h their beet-suga r refinerie s and liquo r distilleries , also the most importan t industrie s of this area.
Neithe r the big landowner s of the rest of German y nor the big industrialist s are in a similarly favourabl e position .
Neithe r of them hav e a compac t kingdo m at their disposal .
Both are scattere d over a wide stretch of territor y and compet e among themselve s and with other social element s surroundin g them for economi c 34-1550 and politica l predominance .
But the economi c foundatio n of this domination o f the Prussia n Junker s is steadily deteriorating .
Here too indebtednes s and impoverishmen t are spreadin g irresistibl y despite al l state assistanc e (and since Frederic k II this item has been include d in every regula r Junker budget) .
Only the actual semi-serfdom sanctione d by law and custom , and the resultin g possibility o f the unlimite d exploitatio n of the rural workers , still barely keep s the drownin g Junker s above water.
Sow the seed of Social Democrac y among these workers , give them the courag e and cohesio n to insist upon their rights, and the glory of the Junkers wil l be at an end.
The great reactionar y power , which to Germany represent s the same barbarous , predator y elemen t as Russian tsardo m does to the whole of Europe , will collapse like a pricked bubble .
The "picke d regiments " of the Prussia n army will become Social-Democratic , which will result in a shift in power that is pregnan t with an entire upheaval .
But for this reason it is of vastly greate r importanc e to win over the rural proletaria t east of the Elbe than the small peasant s of Wester n German y or yet the middle peasant s of Souther n Germany .
It is here, in East-Elb e Prussia, tha t the decisiv e battle of our cause will have to be fought and for this very reason both governmen t and Junkerdom wil l do their utmos t to preven t our gaining access here.
And should , as we are threatened , new forcibl e measure s be resorte d to in order to impede th e spread of our Party their primar y purpos e will be to protect th e East-Elb e rural proletaria t from our propaganda .

INTRODUCTION [TO KAR L MARX' S THE CLASS STRUGGLES IN FRANCE 1848 TO 1850] [1895] 449 The wor k republishe d here was Marx's first attemp t to explain a piece of contemporar y histor y by mean s of his materialis t conception, o n the basis of the prevailin g economi c situation .
In the Communist Manifesto, th e theory was applied in broad outlin e to the whole of moder n history ; in the articles by Marx and myself in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, it was constantl y used to interpre t political event s of the day.
Here, on the other hand, the questio n was to demonstrat e the inner causal connectio n in the course of a development whic h extende d over some years, a developmen t as critical, fo r the whole of Europe , as it was typical ; hence, in accordance wit h the conceptio n of the author , to trace politica l events bac k to effects of what were, in the final analysis , economi c causes.
If events and series of events are judged by curren t history , it will neve r be possibl e to go back to the ultimate economi c causes .
Even today , when the specialise d press provide s such rich material , it still remain s impossibl e even in Englan d to follow day by day the movement o f industr y and trade on the world marke t and the changes whic h take place in the method s of productio n in such a way as to be able to draw a general conclusio n for any point in time from these manifold , complicate d and ever-changin g factors , the most importan t of which, into the bargain , generall y operat e a long tim e in realm s unknow n befor e they suddenl y make themselves forcefull y felt on the surface .
A clear overall view of the economi c history of a given period can never be obtaine d contemporaneously, bu t only subsequently , after the materia l has been collecte d and sifted.
Statistic s are a necessar y auxiliar y aid here, and they always lag behind .
For this reason , it is only too often necessar y in curren t history to treat this, the most decisive , factor a s constant , and the economi c situatio n existin g at the beginning o f the period concerne d as given and unalterabl e for the whol e period , or else to take notice of only such change s in this situatio n as arise out of the patentl y manifes t event s themselves, an d are, therefore , likewis e patentl y manifest .
So here the materialis t metho d has quite often to limit itself to tracin g political conflict s back to the struggle s betwee n the interest s of the existing socia l classes and fraction s of classes caused by economi c development, an d to demonstrat e that the particula r politica l parties are the more or less adequat e politica l expressio n of these same classes an d fraction s of classes .
It is self-eviden t that this unavoidabl e neglec t of contemporane -ous change s in the economi c situation , the very basis of all the processes t o be examined , must be a source of error.
But all the conditions require d for a comprehensiv e presentatio n of curren t history inevitabl y includ e source s of error—which , however , keeps nobody fro m writin g curren t history .
When Mar x undertoo k this work, the source of error mentione d was even more unavoidable .
It was simply impossibl e during the Revolution perio d of 1848-4 9 to follow the economi c transforma -tions takin g place simultaneousl y or even to keep them in view.
It was the same during his first month s of exile in London , in the autumn an d winter of 1849-50 .
But that was precisel y the time when Mar x began this work.
And in spite of these unfavourabl e circumstances, hi s exact knowledg e both of the economi c situatio n in Franc e before , and of the politica l history of that country after, the Februar y Revolutio n made it possibl e for him to presen t a picture o f events which laid bare their inner connection s in a way never attaine d ever since, and which later passed with flying colours th e double test applied by Marx himself .
The firs t test arose when, after the spring of 1850, Marx once again foun d time for economi c studies , and began by applyin g himself t o the economi c history of the previou s ten years.
What he had hithert o deduced , half a priori, fro m sketch y material , thus became absolutel y clear to him from the facts themselves , namely that the world trade crisis of 1847 had been the true mothe r of the Februar y and March revolutions , and that the industria l prosperity whic h had been returnin g graduall y since the middle of 1848 and attaine d full bloom in 1849 and 1850 was the revitalisin g force of a restrengthene d Europea n reaction .
That was cruciall y important.
Wherea s in the first three articles (which appeare d in the January , Februar y and March issues of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-ökonomische Revue, Hamburg , 1850) ther e was still the expectatio n of an early fresh upsurg e of revolutionar y vigour , the historica l review writte n by Marx and myself for the last issue, a doubl e one (May to October) , which was publishe d in the autumn o f 1850, breaks with these illusion s once and for all: "A new revolutio n is possible only in consequenc e of a new crisis.
It is, however, jus t as certain as this crisis.
" 450 But that was the only major change whic h had to be made.
There was absolutel y nothin g to alter in the interpretatio n of events given in the earlier chapters , or in the causal connection s establishe d therein , as proved by the continuation o f the narrativ e from March 10 up to the autum n of 1850 in the said review .
I have, therefore , include d this continuation a s the fourth article in the presen t new edition .
The secon d test was even more severe.
Immediatel y after Louis Bonaparte's coup d'éta t of Decembe r 2, 1851, Marx dealt afresh with the history of France from Februar y 1848 up to this event which conclude d the revolutionar y period for the time being.

a) In this pamphle t the period depicte d in our present publicatio n is again dealt with, albeit in briefe r form.
Compare thi s second presentation , written in the light of the decisive even t which happene d over a year later, with ours and it will be found that the author had very little to change .
What give s our work quite special significanc e is the fact that it was the first to expres s the formul a in which , by commo n agreement, th e workers ' parties of all countrie s in the world briefly summaris e their deman d for economi c transformation : the appropriation o f the means of productio n by society .
In the second chapter , in connectio n with the "right to work", which is described a s "the first clumsy formul a wherei n the revolutionar y demands o f the proletaria t are summarised" , it is said: "but behind th e right to work stands the power over capital; behind the power ove r capital, the appropriation of the means of production, thei r subjection t o the associate d workin g class and, therefore , the abolition o f wage labour, of capital and of their mutual relations".
6 Thus, here, for the first time, the propositio n is formulate d by which moder n workers ' socialis m is sharply differentiate d both from all the differen t shades of feudal, bourgeois , petty-bourgeois , etc.
, socialis m and from the confuse d communit y of goods of a K.

« Utopian an d of primitiv e [naturwüchsigen] workers' communism .
If, later, Mar x extende d the formul a to include appropriatio n of the means o f exchange , this extension , which in any case was self-evident afte r the Communist Manifesto, onl y expresse d a corollary t o the main proposition .
A few wiseacre s in Englan d have of late added that the "mean s of distribution " should also be handed ove r to society .
These gentleme n would be hard put to say what thes e economi c means of distribution , distinc t from the means o f productio n and exchange , actuall y are; unless political means o f distributio n are meant , taxes, poor relief, includin g the Sachsenwald 451 and other endowments .
But, first, these are even now mean s of distributio n in the possessio n of society as a whole, either of the state or of the community , and second , it is precisel y these we want to abolish .
* * * When th e Februar y Revolutio n broke out, all of us, as far as our conceptions o f the condition s and the course of revolutionar y movements wer e concerned , were under the spell of previou s historical experience , particularl y that of France .
It was, indeed , the latte r which had dominate d the whole of Europea n histor y since 1789 , and from which now once again the signal had gone forth for genera l revolutionar y change .
It was, therefore , natura l and unavoidabl e that our conception s of the nature and the course of the "social " revolutio n proclaime d in Paris in Februar y 1848, of the revolutio n of the proletariat , should be strongl y coloure d by memories o f the prototype s of 1789 and 1830.
Moreover , when the Paris uprisin g found its echo in the victoriou s insurrection s in Vienna, Mila n and Berlin ; when the whole of Europe right up to the Russia n frontie r was swept into the movement ; when thereupon i n Paris, in June, the first great battle for power between th e proletaria t and the bourgeoisi e was fought ; when even th e victory of its class so shook the bourgeoisi e of all countries tha t it fled back into the arms of the monarchist-feuda l reaction whic h had just been overthrown—ther e could be no doubt fo r us, under the circumstance s then obtaining , that the great decisiv e battle had commenced , that it would have to be fought ou t in a single, long and vicissitudinou s period of revolution, bu t that it could only end in the final victory of the proletariat.
After th e defeats of 1849 we in no way shared the illusion s of the vulga r democrat s groupe d aroun d the future provisiona l governments in partibus? Thes e vulgar democrat s reckone d on a speedy an d definitiv e victory of the "people " over the "tyrants" ; we reckone d on a long struggle , after the remova l of the "tyrants", amon g the antagonisti c element s conceale d within this "people" itself.
The vulgar democrat s expecte d sparks to fly again any day; we declare d as early as autumn 1850 that at least the first chapter o f the revolutionar y period was closed and that nothin g was to be expecte d until the outbrea k of a new world economi c crisis.
For which reason we were excommunicated , as traitors to the revolution , by the very peopl e who later, almost withou t exception, mad e their peace with Bismarck—s o far as Bismarc k found the m worth the trouble .
But histor y has shown us too to have been wrong , has reveale d our poin t of view at that time as an illusion .
It has done even more; it has not merely dispelle d the erroneou s notion s we then held; it has also completel y transforme d the condition s under which th e proletaria t has to fight.
The mode of struggl e of 1848 is today obsolet e in every respect , and this is a point which deserve s closer examinatio n on the presen t occasion .
All revolution s up to the presen t day have resulte d in the displacement o f the rule of one class by the rule of another ; but all rulin g classes up to now have been only small minoritie s in relation t o the ruled mass of the people .
One ruling minorit y was thus overthrown ; anothe r minorit y seized the helm of state in its stead an d refashione d the state institution s to suit its own interests .
Thus on every occasio n a minorit y group was enable d and called upon to rule by the given degree of economi c development ; and just for that reason, and only for that reason, it happene d that the ruled majorit y either participate d in the revolutio n for the benefit of the former or else simply acquiesce d in it.
But if we disregar d the concret e conten t in each case, the commo n form of all these revolutions wa s that they were minorit y revolutions .
Even when the majorit y took part, it did so—whethe r wittingl y or not—onl y in the service of a minority ; but becaus e of this, or even simply because o f the passive , unresistin g attitud e of the majority , this minority acquire d the appearanc e of being the representativ e of the whol e people .
As a rule, after the first great success , the victoriou s minorit y split; on e half was satisfie d with what had been gained , the other wanted t o go still further , and put forwar d new demands , which, a In partibus infidelium— i n the land of the infidels , outside reality—a n additio n to the title of Catholi c bishop s appointe d to non-Christia n countries.

partly at least, were also in the real or apparen t interes t of the great mas s of the people .
In isolate d cases these more radica l demands wer e actuall y forced through , but often only for the moment; th e more moderat e party would regain the upper hand, and wha t had been won most recentl y would wholly or partly be lost again ; the vanquishe d woul d then cry treacher y or ascribe thei r defeat to accident .
In reality , however , the truth of the matte r was usually this: the achievement s of the first victory were onl y safeguarde d by the second victory of the more radica l party; thi s having been attained , and, with it, what was necessar y for the moment , the radical s and their achievement s vanishe d once mor e from the stage.
All revolution s of moder n times , beginnin g with the great English Revolutio n of the seventeent h century , showe d these features, whic h appeare d inseparabl e from every revolutionar y struggle.
The y appeare d applicable , also, to the struggl e of the proletariat fo r its emancipation ; all the more applicable , since precisely i n 1848 there were but a very few peopl e who had any idea at all of the directio n in which this emancipatio n was to be sought.
Th e proletaria n masses themselves , even in Paris, after the victory, wer e still absolutel y in the dark as to the path to be taken.
And ye t the movemen t was there, instinctive , spontaneous , irrepressible.
Wa s not this just the situatio n in which a revolutio n had to succeed , led, it is true, by a minority , though this time not in the interes t of the minority , but in the finest interes t of the majority? If , in all the longer revolutionar y periods , it was so easy to win over the great masses of the people simply by the plausibl e false representation s of the pressin g minorities , why should they be less susceptibl e to ideas which were the truest reflectio n of their economic condition , which were none other than the clear, rational expressio n of their needs, of needs not yet understoo d but merely vaguel y felt by them? To be sure, this revolutionar y mood of the masses had almost always, and usually very speedily , given way to lassitud e or even to a change to the opposit e as soon as illusion evaporate d and disappointmen t set in.
But what was involved her e were not false representations , but the implementa -tion of the most vital interest s of the great majorit y itself, interest s which, it is true, were at that time by no means clear to this great majority, bu t which were bound to becom e clear to it as their practical implementatio n proceeded , by their convincin g obvious -ness.
And when, as Marx showe d in his third article, in the spring of 1850, the developmen t of the bourgeoi s republi c that arose out of the "social " Revolutio n of 1848 had even concentrate d real power i n the hands of the big bourgeoisie—monarchisticall y inclined a s it was into the bargain—and , on the other hand, had grouped al l the other social classes , peasantr y as well as petty bourgeoisie, aroun d the proletariat , so that during and after the common victory , not they but the proletaria t grown wise from experience ha d to becom e the decisiv e factor—wa s there not every prospect the n of turnin g the revolutio n of the minorit y into a revolution o f the majority ? History ha s proved us wrong, and all who though t like us.
It has made it clear that the state of economi c developmen t on the Continent a t that time was not, by a long way, ripe for the elimination o f capitalis t production ; it has proved this by the economic revolutio n which, since 1848, has seized the whole of the Continent, an d has caused big industr y to take real root in France , Austria, Hungary , Poland and, recently , in Russia , while it has made German y positivel y an industria l countr y of the first rank—all o n a capitalis t basis, which in the year 1848, therefore , still had a great capacit y for expansion .
But it is precisel y this industrial revolutio n which has everywher e produce d clarity in class relations , has remove d a numbe r of intermediat e forms handed dow n from the period of manufactur e and in Easter n Europe eve n from guild handicraft , has create d a genuin e bourgeois an d a genuine large-scal e industria l proletaria t and has pushed the m into the foregroun d of social development .
However , owing to this, the struggl e betwee n these two great classes , a struggle which , outside England , existed in 1848 only in Paris and, at the most, in a few big industria l centres , has spread over the whole of Europ e and reache d an intensit y still inconceivabl e in 1848.
At that time the many obscur e gospel s of the sects, with their panaceas ; today the single generall y recognised , crystal-clea r theory o f Marx, sharply formulatin g the ultimat e aims of the struggle.
A t that time the masses , sundere d and differin g according t o locality and nationality , linked only by the feeling of common suffering , undeveloped , helplessl y tossed to and fro from enthusiasm t o despair ; today the single grea t internationa l army of socialists, marchin g irresistibl y on and growin g daily in number , organisation, discipline , insight and certaint y of victory .
If even this might y army of the proletaria t has still not reached its goal, if, far from winnin g victory by one might y stroke , it has slowly to press forwar d from positio n to positio n in a hard, tenaciou s struggle, thi s only proves , once and for all, how impossibl e it was in 1848 to win social transformatio n merely by a surprise attack.
A bourgeoisi e split into two dynastic-monarchis t sections, 452 a bourgeoisie, however , which demanded , above all, peace and security fo r its financia l operations , faced by a proletaria t vanquished, indeed , but still a menace , a proletaria t around which petty bourgeoi s and peasant s groupe d themselve s more and more—the continua l threat of a violent outbreak , which, neverthe -less, offered absolutel y no prospec t of a final solution—suc h was the situation , as if made-to-measur e for the coup d'éta t of the third, th e pseudo-democrati c pretender , Louis Bonaparte .
On December 2 , 1851, by means of the army, he put an end to the tense situatio n and secure d Europ e interna l tranquillity , only to confer upo n it the blessin g of a new era of wars.
The period of revolutions fro m below was conclude d for the time being; there followed a period of revolution s from above .
The reversio n to the empire in 1851 provide d fresh proof of the immaturit y of the proletaria n aspiration s of that time.
But it was itself to create the condition s under which they were bound to grow mature .
Interna l tranquillit y ensure d the unfettere d ad-vancement o f the new industria l boom; the necessit y of keepin g the army occupie d and of divertin g the revolutionar y current s in an outwar d directio n produce d the wars in which Bonaparte , under th e pretex t of assertin g the "principl e of nationalities", 453 sought t o secure annexation s for France .
His imitator , Bismarck , adopted th e same policy for Prussia ; he carried out his coup d'état, his revolutio n from above , in 1866, against the Germa n Confederation an d Austria , and no less agains t the Prussia n Konfliktskammer.
45* But Europ e was too small for two Bonaparte s and thu s the irony of history had it that Bismarc k overthre w Bonaparte, an d King William of Prussia not only establishe d the little Germa n empire , but also the French republic .
The overal l outcome, however , was that in Europ e the independenc e and internal unit y of the great nations , with the exceptio n of Poland , had becom e a fact.
Within relativel y modes t limits, it is true, but for all that on a scale large enoug h to allow the developmen t of the workin g class to procee d withou t finding nationa l complica -tions an y longe r a serious obstacle .
The grave-digger s of the Revolution o f 1848 had becom e the executor s of its will.
And alongside the m there already rose threateningl y the heir of 1848, the proletariat , in the shape of the International.
After th e war of 1870-71 , Bonapart e vanishe d from the stage and Bismarck' s missio n was fulfilled , so that he could now sink back agai n to the positio n of an ordinar y Junker .
The period , however, wa s brough t to a close by the Paris Commune .
A perfidious attemp t by Thiers to steal the canno n of the Paris National Guar d sparke d off a victoriou s rising.
It was shown once more tha t in Paris none but a proletaria n revolutio n is any longer possible.
Afte r the victory power fell, quite of itself and quite undisputed, int o the hands of the workin g class.
And once again it was prove d how impossibl e even then, twenty years after the time described i n our work, this rule of the workin g class still was.
On the one hand, France left Paris in the lurch, looked on while it bled to death from the bullets of MacMahon ; on the other hand, the Commun e was consume d in unfruitfu l strife betwee n the two parties whic h split it, the Blanquist s (the majority ) and the Proudhonists (th e minority) , neither of which knew what was to be done.
Th e victory which came as a gift in 1871 remaine d just as unfruitful a s the surpris e attack of 1848.
It was believe d that the militan t proletaria t had been finally buried wit h the Paris Commune .
But, completel y to the contrary , it dates its most powerfu l resurgenc e from the Commun e and the Franco-Prussian War .
The recruitmen t of the whole of the population abl e to bear arms into armies that hencefort h could be counted onl y in millions , and the introductio n of fire-arms , projectiles an d explosive s of hithert o unprecedente d yield, com-pletely transforme d all warfare .
This revolution , on the one hand, put an abrup t end to the Bonapartis t war period and ensure d peaceful industria l developmen t by makin g any war other than a world wa r of unprecedente d cruelt y and absolutel y incalculabl e outcome a n impossibility .
On the other hand, it caused militar y expenditure t o rise in geometrica l progressio n and thereb y forced up taxes to exorbitan t levels and so drove the poorer classes of people int o the arms of socialism .
The annexatio n of Alsace -Lorraine, th e immediat e cause of the mad competitio n in armaments, wa s able to set the French and Germa n bourgeoisi e chauvinistically a t each other's throats ; for the worker s of the two countries i t became a new bond of unity.
And the anniversar y of the Pari s Commun e becam e the first universa l holida y of the whole proletariat .
The wa r of 1870-7 1 and the defea t of the Commun e transferred th e centre of gravit y of the Europea n workers ' movement i n the meantim e from Franc e to Germany , as Marx had foretold .
In France it naturall y took years to recove r from the blood-letting o f May 1871.
In Germany , on the other hand, where industry—fostered, i n addition , in positivel y hothous e fashion by the blessin g of the French milliards 455—developed a t increasin g speed, Social-Democrac y experience d a still more rapid and enduring growth .
Thanks to the intelligen t use which the Germa n workers mad e of the universa l suffrag e introduce d in 1866, the astonishing growt h of the party is made plain to all the world by incontestable figures : 1871, 102,000 ; 1874, 352,000 ; 1877, 493,000 Social-Democratic votes .
Then came recognitio n of this advanc e by high authorit y in the shape of the Anti-Socialis t Law 456; the party was temporaril y broke n up, the numbe r of votes droppe d to 312,000 i n 1881.
But that was quickly overcome , and then, under the pressur e of the Exceptiona l Law, withou t a press, withou t a legal organisatio n and withou t the right of associatio n and assembly, rapi d expansio n began in earnest : 1884, 550,000 ; 1887, 763,000; 1890 , 1,427,00 0 votes.
The hand of the state was paralysed.
Th e Anti-Socialis t Law disappeared ; the socialis t vote rose to 1,787,000 , over a quarter of all the votes cast.
The government an d the ruling classe s had exhauste d all their expedients—uselessly, pointlessly , unsuccessfully .
The tangibl e proofs o f their impotence , which the authorities , from nigh t watchman t o the imperia l chancello r had had to accept—an d that from th e despise d workers!—thes e proof s were counte d in millions.
Th e state was at the end of its tether, the worker s only at the beginnin g of theirs.
But, besides , the Germa n worker s rendere d a second great service t o their cause in additio n to the first, a service performe d by their mere existenc e as the strongest , most discipline d and most rapidly growin g socialis t party.
They supplie d their comrade s in all countries wit h a new weapon , and one of the most potent, when they showe d them how to make use of universa l suffrage .
There ha d long been universa l suffrag e in France , but it had fallen int o disreput e throug h the way it had been abused by the Bonapartist government .
After the Commun e there was no workers' part y to make use of it.
It had also existed in Spain since the republic, 457 but in Spain electio n boycott s had been the rule for all seriou s oppositio n parties from time immemorial .
The experi -ence of the Swiss with universa l suffrag e was also anythin g but encouraging fo r a workers ' party.
The revolutionar y worker s of the Lati n countrie s had been wont to regard the suffrag e as a snare, as an instrumen t of governmen t trickery .
It was differen t in Germany.
Th e Communist Manifesto ha d alread y proclaime d the winning o f universa l suffrage , of democracy , as one of the first and mos t importan t tasks of the militan t proletariat , and Lassalle had agai n taken up this point.
Now that Bismarc k found himsel f compelled t o introduc e this franchis e as the only mean s of interesting th e mass of the people in his plans, our worker s immediately too k it in earnes t and sent August Bebel to the first, constituent Reichstag .
And from that day on they have used the franchise i n a way which has paid them a thousandfol d and has served a s a model to the worker s of all countries .
The franchis e has been , in the words of the Frenc h Marxis t programme , transformé de moyen de duperie qu'il a été jusqu'ici en instrument d'émancipation —transformed b y them from a means of deception , which it was before, into an instrumen t of emancipation.
458 And if universal suffrag e had offere d no other advantag e than that it allowed u s to count our number s every three years; that by the regularly established , unexpectedl y rapid rise in our vote it increased i n equal measur e the workers ' certaint y of victory and the disma y of their opponents , and so becam e our best means of propaganda; tha t it accuratel y informe d us of our own strengt h and that of all opposin g parties , and thereb y provide d us with a measure o f proportio n second to none for our actions , safeguard -ing us from untimel y timidit y as much as from untimel y foolhardiness—if thi s had been the only advantag e we gained from th e suffrage , it would still have been much more than enough.
Bu t it did more than this by far.
In electio n propagand a it provide d us with a means, second to none, of getting in touch with the mass of the people where they still stand aloof from us; of forcin g all parties to defend their views and actions against our attacks befor e all the people ; and, further , it provide d our representatives i n the Reichsta g with a platform from which they could spea k to their opponent s in parliament , and to the masses outside, wit h quite differen t authorit y and freedo m than in the press or at meetings .
Of what avail was their Anti-Socialis t Law to the governmen t and the bourgeoisi e when electio n campaignin g and socialis t speeche s in the Reichsta g continuall y broke throug h it? With thi s successfu l utilisatio n of universa l suffrage , however , an entirely ne w metho d of proletaria n struggl e came into operation , and this metho d quickl y took on a more tangibl e form.
It was found tha t the state institutions , in which the rule of the bourgeoisie i s organised , offer the workin g class still further levers to fight these very state institutions .
The worker s took part in elections t o particula r diets, to municipa l council s and to trades courts; the y conteste d with the bourgeoisi e every post in the occupation o f which a sufficien t part of the proletaria t had a say.
And so it happene d that the bourgeoisi e and the governmen t came to be much more afraid of the legal than of the illegal action of the workers ' party, of the results of election s than of those of rebellion.
For here , too, the condition s of the struggl e had change d fundamentally.
Rebellio n in the old style, street fightin g with barricades, whic h decide d the issue everywher e up to 1848, had become largel y outdated .
Let us have no illusion s about it: a real victory of insurrectio n over the militar y in street fighting , a victory as betwee n two armies, i s one of the rarest exceptions .
And the insurgent s counted o n it just as rarely.
For them it was solely a question of making th e troops yield to moral influence s which , in a fight between th e armies of two warrin g countries , do not come into play at all or do so to a much smalle r extent.
If they succee d in this, the troops fail to respond , or the commandin g officer s lose their heads , and the insurrectio n wins.
If they do not succeed in this, then, even where the militar y are in the minority , the superiority o f better equipmen t and training , of uniform leader -ship, of the planne d employmen t of the militar y forces and of discipline make s itself felt.
The most that an insurrectio n can achieve i n the way of actual tactical operation s is the proficien t construction an d defenc e of a single barricade .
Mutual support , the dispositio n and employmen t of reserves—i n short, concerte d and co-ordinate d action of the individua l detachments , indispensa -ble even for the defenc e of one borough , not to speak of the whole of a large town, will be attainabl e only to a very limited extent, an d usually not at all.
Concentratio n of the militar y forces at a decisive point is, of course , out of the questio n here.
Hence passive defenc e is the predominan t form of struggle ; an attack will be mounte d here and there, by way of exception , in the form of occasional thrust s and assault s on the flanks; as a rule, however , it will be limite d to the occupatio n of position s abandone d by retreating troops .
In addition , the militar y have at their disposa l artillery an d fully equippe d corps of trained engineers , means of warfare which , in nearly every case, the insurgent s entirel y lack.
No wonder , then, that even the barricad e fightin g conducte d with the greates t heroism—Paris , June 1848; Vienna , Octobe r 1848; Dresden, Ma y 1849—ende d in the defeat of the insurrectio n as soon as the leader s of the attack , unhampere d by politica l considerations, acte d accordin g to purely militar y criteria , and their soldier s remaine d reliable .
The numerou s successe s of the insurgent s up to 1848 were due to a great variety of causes.
In Paris, in July 1830 and Februar y 1848, as in most of the Spanis h street fighting , a civic guard stood between th e insurgent s and the military .
This guard either sided directly wit h the insurrection , or else by its lukewarm , indecisiv e 35-1550 attitude cause d the troops likewis e to vacillate , and supplie d the insurrection wit h arms into the bargain .
Where this civic guard opposed th e insurrectio n from the outset, as in June 1848 in Paris, the insurrectio n was vanquished .
In Berlin in 1848, the people were victoriou s partly throug h considerabl e reinforcement s in the shape of new fightin g forces during the night and the mornin g of March 19th , partly as a result of the exhaustio n and poor rations of the troops , and, finally , partly as a result of the paralysi s engendered b y the command .
But in all cases the fight was won because th e troops failed to respond , becaus e the commandin g officers los t the faculty to decide or because their hands were tied.
Even in the classic time of street fighting , therefore , the barricade produce d more of a moral than a materia l effect.
It was a means of shakin g the steadfastnes s of the military .
If it held out until thi s was attained , victory was won; if not, the outcom e was defeat.
Thi s is the main point which must be kept in view, also when examinin g the outloo k for possibl e future street fighting.
3 Back in 1849 already , this outlook was pretty poor.
Everywher e the bourgeoisi e had throw n in its lot with the governments , "culture an d property " had hailed and feaste d the militar y moving agains t insurrection .
The barricad e had lost its magic; the soldier n o longe r saw behin d it "the people" , but rebels , subversives, plunderers , levellers , the scum of society ; the officer had in the course of time becom e versed in the tactical forms of street fighting , he no longer marche d straigh t ahead and withou t cover agains t the improvise d breastwork , but went round it through gardens , yards and houses .
And this was now successful , with a little skill, in nine cases out of ten.
But sinc e then there have been very many more changes , and all in favou r of the military .
If the big towns have becom e considerably bigger , the armies have becom e bigger still.
Paris and Berlin have , since 1848, grown less than fourfold , but their garrisons hav e grown more than that.
By means of the railways , these garrison s can, in twenty-fou r hours, be more than doubled , and in forty-eigh t hours they can be increase d to huge armies .
The armin g of this enormousl y increase d numbe r of troops has become incomparabl y more effective .
In 1848 the smooth-bore , muzzle-loading percussio n gun, today the small-calibre , breech -loading magazin e rifle, which shoots four times as far, ten times as accurately an d ten times as fast as the former .
At that time the relatively ineffectiv e round shot and grape-sho t of the artillery ; a The last sentenc e is omitted in Die Neue Zeit and in the 1895 edition of Die Klassenkämpfe in Frankreich 1848 bis 1850.
—Ed.
today th e percussio n shells, of which one is sufficien t to demolis h the best barricade .
At that time the pick-ax e of the sapper for breaking throug h fire proof walls; today the dynamit e cartridge .
On the other hand, all the condition s of the insurgents ' side have grow n worse.
An insurrectio n with which all section s of the people sympathis e is likely to recur; in the class struggl e all the middle strat a will never in all probabilit y group themselve s around the proletaria t so exclusivel y that in compariso n the party of reaction gathere d round the bourgeoisi e will well-nig h disappear .
The "people" , therefore , will always appear divided , and thus a most powerfu l lever, so extraordinaril y effectiv e in 1848, is gone.
If more soldier s who have seen servic e came over to the insurrectionists, th e arming of them would becom e so much the more difficult .
The huntin g and fancy guns of the munition s shops—even i f not previousl y made unusabl e by the remova l of part of the lock on police orders—ar e far from being a match for the magazin e rifle of the soldier , even in close fighting .
Up to 1848 it was possibl e to make the necessar y ammunitio n oneself out of powde r and lead; today the cartridge s differ for each gun, and are everywher e alike only in one point, namely , that they are a complicated produc t of big industry , and therefor e not to be manufactured ex tempore, wit h the result that most guns are useless as long as one does not possess the ammunitio n suited only to them.
And , finally, since 1848 the newly built quarter s of the big cities hav e been laid out in long, straight , broad streets , tailor-made t o give full effect to the new cannon s and rifles.
The revolutionary woul d have to be mad to choose of his own accord the new workin g class district s in the north or east of Berlin for a barricade fight .
Does tha t mean that in the future street fightin g will no longer play any role? Certainl y not.
It only means that the condition s since 184 8 have becom e far more unfavourabl e for civilia n fighters an d far more favourabl e for the military .
In future, street fighting can , therefore , be victoriou s only if this disadvantageou s situation i s compensate d by other factors .
Accordingly , it will occur more seldo m at the beginnin g of a great revolutio n than at its later stages , and will have to be undertake n with greate r forces.
These, however , may then well prefer, as in the whole great French Revolutio n or on Septembe r 4 and Octobe r 31, 1870, in Paris, 3 the open attack to passive barricad e tactics.

35* Does th e reade r now understan d why the powers-that-b e positively wan t to get us to go where the guns shoot and the sabres slash? Wh y they accuse us today of cowardice , because we do not take withou t more ado to the streets , where we are certain of defeat in advance ? Why they so earnestl y implor e us to play for once the part of cannon fodder ? The gentleme n pour out their petition s and their challenge s for nothing, fo r absolutel y nothing .
We are not that stupid .
They might jus t as well deman d from their enemy in the next war that he shoul d accept battle in the line formatio n of old Fritz, 3 or in the columns o f whole division s à la Wagram an d Waterloo, 459 and with the flint-loc k in his hands at that.
If condition s have change d in the case of war betwee n nations , this is no less true in the case of the class struggle .
The time of surpris e attacks , of revolution s carried throug h by small consciou s minoritie s at the head of masses lackin g consciousnes s is past.
Where it is a question of a complete transformatio n of the social organisation , the masse s themselves mus t also be in on it, must themselve s already have grasped wha t is at stake, what they are fightin g for, body and soul.
b The histor y of the last fifty years has taught us that.
But in order that the masse s may understan d what is to be done, long, persistent wor k is required , and it is just this work that we are now pursuing, an d with a success which drives the enemy to despair .
In the Latin countries , too, it is being realise d more and more that the old tactics must be revised .
Everywher e the Germa n example o f utilisin g the suffrage , of winnin g all posts accessibl e to us, has been imitated ; everywher e the unprepare d launchin g of an attack ha s been relegate d to the background.
0 In France , where for more than a hundre d years the ground has been undermine d by one revolutio n after another , where there is not a single party which ha s not done its share in conspiracies , insurrection s and all other revolutionar y actions ; in France , where, as a result, the government i s by no means sure of the army and where the conditions fo r an insurrectionar y coup de main are altogethe r far more favourabl e than in Germany—eve n in France the Socialist s are realisin g more and more that no lasting victory is possibl e for a Frederic k IL—Ed.

them unles s they first win over the great mass of the people , i.
e.
the peasant s in this instance .
Slow propagand a work and parliamentary activit y are recognise d here, too, as the immediat e tasks of the party.
Successe s have not been lacking .
Not only have a whole series of municipa l council s been won; fifty Socialist s have seats in the Chambers , and they have alread y overthrow n three ministries an d a presiden t of the republic .
In Belgiu m last year the workers force d the adoptio n of the franchise , and have been victorious i n a quarter of the constituencies .
In Switzerland , in Italy, in Denmark , yes, even in Bulgari a and Romani a the Socialists ar e represente d in the parliaments .
In Austri a all parties agree tha t our admissio n to the Imperia l Counci l can no longer be withheld.
W e will get in, that is certain ; the only questio n still in dispute is : by which door? And even in Russia , when the famou s Zemsky Sobor461 meets—tha t Nationa l Assembl y to which young Nicholas offer s such vain resistanc e — even there we can reckon with certaint y on being represente d in it.
Of course , our foreign comrade s do not in the least renounc e their righ t to revolution .
The right to revolutio n is, after all, the only really "historica l right", the only right on which all moder n states res t withou t exception , Mecklenbur g included , whose aristocratic revolutio n was ended in 1755 by the "hereditar y settlement", th e gloriou s charte r of feudalis m still valid today.
4 2 The righ t to revolutio n is so incontestabl y recognise d in the general consciousnes s that even Genera l von Boguslawsk i derives the right to a coup d'état, which he vindicate s for his Kaiser, solely from thi s popula r right.
But whateve r may happe n in other countries , the Germa n Social-Democrats occup y a special positio n and thus, at least in the immediate future , have a special task.
The two million voters whom the y send to the ballot box, togethe r with the young men and wome n who stand behind them as non-voters , form the most numerous, mos t compac t mass, the decisiv e "shock force" of the international proletaria n army.
This mass already supplie s over a quarter o f the votes cast; and as the by-election s to the Reichstag , the Diet election s in individua l states, the municipa l counci l and trades cour t election s demonstrate , it is constantl y on the increase .
Its growt h proceed s as spontaneously , as steadily , as irresistibly , and at the same time as tranquill y as a natural process .
All government interventio n has proved powerles s against it.
We can count eve n today on two and a quarter million voters .
If it continues i n this fashion , by the end of the centur y we shall have the greate r part of the middle strata of society , petty bourgeoisi e and smal l peasants , and we shall grow into the decisiv e power in the land , before which all other powers will have to bow, whethe r they like it or not.
To keep this growth going withou t interruptio n until it gets beyond the contro l of the prevailin g governmenta l system o f itself, not to fritter away this daily increasin g shock force in vanguar d skirmishes , but to keep it intact until the decisiv e day,a tha t is our main task.
And there is only one means by which the stead y rise of the socialis t fighting forces in German y could be temporarily halted , and even thrown back for some time: a clash on a grand scale with the military , a blood-lettin g like that of 1871 in Paris.
In the long run even that would be overcome .
To shoot a party whic h number s million s out of existenc e is too much even for all the magazin e rifles of Europe and America .
But the norma l development woul d be impeded , the shock force would, perhaps , not be availabl e at the critical moment , the decisiv e combat b would be delayed , protracte d and attende d by a heavier toll.
The iron y of world history turns everythin g upside down.
We, the "revolutionaries" , the "overthrowers"—w e are thrivin g far better o n legal method s than on illegal method s and overthrow .
The partie s of order, as they call themselves , are perishin g under the legal condition s created by themselves .
They cry despairingl y with Odilo n Barrot : la légalité nous tue, legality i s the death of us463; wherea s we, under this legality , get firm muscle s and rosy cheeks an d look like life eternal .
And if we are not so crazy as to let ourselve s be driven to street fightin g in order to please them, then in the end there is nothing left for them to do but themselve s break throug h this dire legality .
Meanwhile the y make new laws agains t overthrows .
Again everything i s turned upside down.
These anti-overthro w fanatic s of today , are they not themselve s the overthrower s of yesterday ? Have we perchanc e evoked the civil war of 1866? Have we drive n the Kin g of Hanover , the Electo r of Hesse, and the Duke of Nassau fro m their hereditar y lawful domain s and annexe d these hereditary domains? 464 And these overthrower s of the Germa n Confederation an d three crowns by the grace of God complai n of a In Die Neue Zeit and in the 1895 edition of Die Klassenkämpfe in Frankreich the word s "not to fritter away this daily increasin g shock force in vanguar d skirmishes, bu t to keep it intact until the decisiv e day" are omitted.

overthrow! Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes?* Wh o could allow th e Bismarc k worshipper s to rail at overthrow ? Let them , nevertheless , put throug h their anti-overthro w bills, make the m still worse, transfor m the whole penal law into india-rubber, the y will gain nothin g but fresh proof of their impotence.
I f they want to deal Social-Democrac y a serious blow they will have to resort to quite other measures .
They can cope with the Social-Democrati c overthrow , which just now is doing so well by keepin g the law, only by an overthro w on the part of the parties o f Order, an overthro w which cannot live withou t breakin g the law .
Mr.
Rössler , the Prussia n bureaucrat , and Mr.
von Boguslawski, th e Prussia n general , have shown them the only way perhaps stil l possibl e of getting at the workers , who simply refuse to let themselve s be lured into street fighting .
Breach of the constitution, dictatorship , return to absolutism , regis voluntas suprema lex\ h Therefore , take courage , gentlemen ; here half measures wil l not do; here you must go the whole hog! But do not forget that the Germa n empire , like all small states and generall y all moder n states, is a product of contract; o f the contract, first , of the prince s with one anothe r and, second , of the princes wit h the people .
If one side breaks the contract , the whole contract fall s to the ground ; the other side is then also no longer bound, a s Bismarc k demonstrate d to us so beautifull y in 1866.
If, therefore, yo u break the constitutio n of the Reich , Social -Democracy i s free, and can do as it pleases with regard to you.
But it will hardly blurt out to you today what it is going to do then.
c It is now, almost to the year, sixteen centurie s since a dangerou s party of overthro w was likewis e active in the Roman empire .
It undermined religio n and all the foundation s of the state; it flatly denied tha t Caesar' s will was the suprem e law; it was withou t a fatherland, wa s international ; it spread over the whole empire , from Gau l to Asia, and beyond the frontier s of the empire .
It had long carrie d on seditiou s activitie s undergroun d in secret; for a considerable time , however , it had felt itself strong enoug h to come ou t into the open.
This party of overthrow , which was known b y the name of Christians , was also strongl y represente d in the army ; whole legions were Christian .

Born on New Year's Day, 1823, b of peasan t parents , at St.
Wendel, she came , at the age of 14, into the family of the Von Westphalen s of Trier.
Jenny von Westphalen i n 1843 becam e the wife of Karl Marx.
From 1837 to the deat h of Mrs.
Marx in 1881, with the exceptio n of the first few month s of the marrie d life, the two wome n were constan t companions.
Afte r the death of Mrs.
Marx in Decembe r 1881, and of Marx on March 14th, 1883, Helena Demut h went to keep house fo r Frederic k Engels.
The leader s of the Socialis t movemen t bore testimon y to "her strong common-sense , her absolut e rectitude o f character , her ceaseles s thoughtfulnes s for others, her reliability, an d the essentia l truthfulnes s of her nature" .
Engels at her funera l declare d that Marx took counse l of Helena Demuth , not only in difficul t and intricat e party matters , but even in respect o f his economica l writings .
"As for me," he said, "what work I have been able to do since the death of Marx has been largely du e to the sunshin e and suppor t of her presenc e in the house.
" Helen a is buried at Highgat e in the same grave as Marx and his wife.

530 ENGELS, FREDERIC K Born in Barme n on November 28, 1820 .
Took up commerce and worke d as an office clerk from 1837 to 1841, first in Barme n and from 1838 in Bremen .
After servin g for a year as an army volunteer (1841-42) , he joined his father's busines s in Mancheste r in 1843, staying there until 1844.
From 1845 to 1848 he lived in Brussels (wit h K.
Marx) and, alternately , in Paris; from 1848 to May 184 9 he worked for the Neue Rheinische Zeitung i n Cologne.
In June and July of that year he took part in the uprisin g in South Germany a s an aide-de-cam p in Willich' s voluntee r corps.
Then he went to Londo n for a short time and, in 1850, rejoine d his father' s concern i n Manchester , workin g first as a clerk and, from 1864, as a joint proprietor .
In 1869 he retired from busines s for good.
He has lived in Londo n since 1870.

.
.
Mr.
Engels , an enemy o f the interview, was kin d enoug h to make an exception fo r us and let us have his impressions .
"What d o you think," we asked him, "of the recent outrage s in Paris committe d by the anarchists? " "I can only see in them the work of agents-provocateur s who have bee n paid to try to dishonou r the parties in which they play a part.
The governmen t has every interes t in the occurrenc e of these explosions , as they simultaneousl y serve the interest s of the bourgeoisie i n genera l and the intrigue s of certain politica l groups in particular .
In fact the intentio n is to panic the population , organise terro r and lead a reaction .
"The sam e procedur e was employe d in German y recentl y at the time of the 'Berlin troubles'.
470 Ther e again we would do well to seek out the hand of the police.
It is indisputabl e that on the first day of these allegedl y socialis t demonstration s some of our people may hav e been involve d in the movement , but our erring friend s soon realise d the true characte r of the demonstratio n and withdrew fro m it immediately .
"The proo f is that several shops belongin g to known socialist s were looted .
The trial of the detaine d rioters showe d that the leaders wer e anti-Semite s seekin g to exploi t the hunge r of a few poor wretche s by getting them to shout: 'Down with the Jews!' "In Italy—agai n the same set-up with the proceeding s institute d against Ciprian i and the other anarchists .
There, too, the actions of the agents-provocateur s have been expose d in open court.
"But tha t does not always work.
In Paris there were one or two wretches willin g to play the police' s game, but nobody except the police themselve s will be able to claim that they belong to the socialist party.
" 36-1550 Appendices RUSSIAN DIPLOMAC Y "Do you not fear that all these domesti c upheaval s will lead the government s to look aroun d for a distractio n in a continenta l war? Take your Empero r William , for example.
.
.
" "No.
It is my wish that Empero r William may enjoy a long life, for the greate r good of the Germa n socialists, " said Mr.
Engels , laughing.
"Anyway , I don't believe there will be a war in the immediate future.
" "The allianc e betwee n Russia and France has not caused you any apprehensio n on this score? " "Not at all.
Last year, perhaps , there was a slight inclinatio n to take the offensive .
The demonstration s in Cronstadt, 471 the very visible advance s which imperia l Russia made to republica n France may hav e appeare d suspicious .
The concentration s of troops on the borde r also appeare d to give cause for some alarm.
But today things ar e quite different .
"In fact, Russia would like to go to war, but it could not do so.
At presen t it has to face an enemy more redoubtabl e than any other: famine .
"This scourg e was not the result of a passing shortag e caused by some climati c or other accident : it is the outcom e of the new organisation o f Russia n society .
"Since th e Crimea n War, when entire regiment s perishe d in the snow, th e situatio n has change d considerably .
This war marks the start of a major crisis in Russia n history .
When defeat was complete, whe n Russia' s powerlessnes s had been demonstrate d to the whol e of Europe , Tsar Nicholas , in despai r after ascertainin g the woefu l state of his empire , did not hesitate to poison himself .
On ascendin g to the throne , Alexande r II was therefor e obliged to try to find a solution to the appallin g situatio n in which his country foun d itself.
" THE CAUSE S OF THE FAMIN E IN RUSSI A "That wa s when the Tsar proceede d to emancipat e the serfs, which provide d an excus e for a new redistributio n of land between th e nobles and the peasants .
The nobles were given the best land , as well as the lakes, rivers and forests .
The peasant s received onl y land of inferio r quality , and this distributio n was done in an inadequat e manne r and for a sum repayabl e in annual instalments ove r a period of 49 years! What was the outcome ? "The peasant s were unable to meet the payment s to the state and the y had to borrow : they had too much to die and not enough t o live on.
A gang of kulaks (money-lenders ) pounce d on these tiller s of the soil, who graduall y becam e indebte d to such an extent a s to lose all hope of ever freeing themselves .
When the usurers wer e no longer willing to provid e advances , the peasant s were force d to sell their harvest s to obtain money , and they sold not only the wheat they neede d to live on but also their vital seed-corn, s o that future harvest s were jeopardised .
"In thes e circumstance s the first poor harves t would be sure to result in a fullblow n famine .
This famine , in turn, has just delivered th e final blow to agricultura l productio n in Russia .
In effect, th e peasant , no longer able to feed his livestock , has been forced eithe r to slaughte r them or to sell them off.
Now, withou t farm animals , it is not possibl e to till or manur e the land.
As a result, agricultura l productio n will be interrupte d for many years to come .
"The emancipatio n of the serfs was only one aspect of the economic revolutio n which has occurre d in Russia ; the other aspect is the artificia l creatio n of an industria l bourgeoisi e destine d to serve as an intermediar y class.
To fasten the process , a truly prohibitive syste m was established , favourin g and developin g Russian industr y in an extraordinar y fashion ; but as this industr y was not able to export , it needed a domesti c market .
Now the Russian peasan t hardly buys anything , accustome d as he is to making everythin g himself : houses, tools, clothes , etc.
; not long ago he even produce d wooden , iron and leathe r articles which he sold at the fairs.
But when the peasan t was deprive d of wood by giving th e forests to the nobility , rural industr y all but collapsed .
Manufacturing industr y came along to finish it off, and the peasants wer e oblige d to resort to it.
At the very momen t when this industr y was about to triumph , famine arrive d to deal it a mortal blow : the peasant s are no longer able to buy anythin g it produces, an d the ruin of the one leads to the ruin of the other.
" THE ECONOMT C AND MILITAR Y SITUATIO N "So in your view the economi c situatio n in Russia will preven t it from thinkin g of going to war?" "Yes.
I am not exaggeratin g when I say that the picture which Vauban an d Boisguillebert 3 painted of the French peasan t in the a See this volume , p.
249.
— Ed.
36* seventeenth centur y can be applied to the Russia n peasant , today reduced t o eating grass.
The transitio n from the feudal regime to the bourgeoi s regim e in Franc e was not accomplishe d withou t upheavals; i n Russia it has just produce d a crisis which,fro m being acute, threaten s to becom e chronic .
For all these reasons , the Russians ar e more concerne d at the momen t with eating rather than fighting.
" "The las t Russia n loan.
.
.
" "I was going to mentio n that.
It is an enormou s setback .
The French bourgeoisie , which is much given to talking about revenge , did not push its patriotis m to the point of openin g its purse.
The Tsar's governmen t asked for twenty million pound s sterling ; all they got was twelve.
.
.
" "It has been said that the Rothschild s contribute d to the failure of this loan in order to aveng e their fellow-believer s who have been persecute d by the Russia n government?" "I have attacke d the Rothschild s enoug h to be able to defend them agains t the charg e of being so stupid .
As bankers , the Rothschilds ar e only concerne d with their own interests , interest s which amounte d to extractin g the bigges t possibl e commission s and exploitin g as many gullibl e fools as possible .
That's all.
" "To sum up, you do not believe in the power of Russia? " "Russia, whil e strong in defence , is not strong in attack either at sea or on land.
I have shown you that the economi c situatio n does not permi t it to indulg e in dangerou s and costly ventures .
If we examine it s military organisatio n we shall see that Russia does not pose a danger from this angle either.
"In the event of war it would not put more men into the line than it currentl y has under arms.
The reserve s do not exist except on pape r and, althoug h it may have thousand s and thousand s of men, it has no reserve officer s to comman d them.
Where would it get them from? From what source ? "In German y we have fifty per cent more reserve officers than we need .
In this respect would not France also be in a position of relative inferiority? " our interlocuto r asks us.
A STRON G FRANC E "Not at all," we reply.
"In France we do not have more officers than we need; but the officer s and NCOs are at full strength.
" "I am not in the slightes t dismayed, " says Mr.
Engels .
"I do not wish to see the Germa n army strong enoug h to conque r all Europe.
In orde r to attain our goal, the liberatio n of the European workin g class may need a powerfu l France , the master of its own fate, as well as a German y that enjoys the same advantages.
You r compatrio t Saint-Simo n was the first to proclai m the necessit y of an allianc e betwee n France , Englan d and German y as a primary conditio n for peace in Europe.
3 That is the true 'Triple Alliance'.
472 "In conclusion , let us put it to you that you have painte d a rather gloom y picture o f the situatio n in Russia.
" "Not at all.
Look, would you like to hear an anecdote ? You know tha t in order to aid the starvin g Russia n peasant s it was decided t o send them wheat from the Caucasus , where they had a surplus.
Order s were given to this effect; the wheat was gathere d together i n large quantitie s and waggon s were sent to transpor t it.
Well, wha t happene d was that the empty waggon s were groupe d in such large number s that congestio n occurred : the wheat was alongside th e waggons , and the waggon s could not leave.
On learning o f this, the Tsar b went into a violent rage and sent a general t o the scene; this militar y man made a lot of noise, announced tha t everythin g was proceedin g normall y and only managed t o send off a few trains : the greate r part of the wheat rotted wher e it was! What would have happene d in the event of mobilisation? Russi a does not have many railway s yet, and its officers d o not even know how to use them.
" THE QUESTIO N OF ALSACE-LORRAIN E "One mor e question : what about Alsace-Lorraine , the cause of all the disagreements? D o you believe in a peacefu l solutio n acceptabl e to both France and Germany?" "I hope that the Germa n socialis t party will be in power in ten years or so.
Its first concer n will be to put the peopl e of Alsace-Lorraine i n a position to decide their own politica l future.
Consequently th e questio n will be settled withou t a single French soldier havin g to stir.
On the contrary , a war betwee n German y and Franc e would be the only means of preventin g the socialists ' coming t o power .
And if France and Russia in allianc e attacke d Germany, th e latter would defen d to the death its nationa l existence, i n which the Germa n socialist s have an even greate r a See this volume , p.

.
.
Having learn t the purpos e of my visit, Engels told me the following : "Germany i s enterin g one of the graves t phases of its history , but let me add straightawa y that we socialist s have nothin g to fear from th e situation ; on the contrary , we shall gain some major benefits fro m it.
It is above all thanks to our efforts , that the military credit s were refused.
479 It was impossibl e for the variou s parties i n Parliamen t to ignore us, and even more so for the government, whic h knows full well that we are its most dangerou s enemy.
Whe n the governmen t motion to seek new militar y credits became know n in Germany , the people were indignant , and the vote of the Centre and the Radicals 48 was certainl y influence d by the pressur e of public opinion .
"You see, " added Engels, deliberately stressin g his statement , "in German y the people said: 'We have enough soldiers; there must be an end to itV " "And th e new Reichstag , Mr.
Engels? " "As I speak to you, it seems to me that the next Reichsta g will be even les s incline d to approv e the credit s than the old one.
However, I do not shut my eyes to the possibilit y that we may see the newl y elected deputies , with five years of legislatur e in front of them, negotiatin g with the government , which with a little gentle arm-twisting coul d force throug h a compromise .
In the likely event of the Reichsta g refusin g the credits , it would be necessar y to resort to a second dissolution , which I am convince d would result in the electio n of a Reichsta g even more hostile to acceptin g the government's proposals .
Then the conflic t would move into a critical stage , and it would be a matter of finding out who is to have power , Parliamen t or the emperor .
It would be a repetitio n of the conflic t betwee n Bismarc k and the Prussia n Chambe r in 1864, which was brough t to an end by the war with Austria.
" 481 By his very reply, Frederic k Engels prompted m e to ask him to conside r the two eventualities alread y discusse d in the Europea n press: that of a domesti c coup d'état and that of a diversio n abroad .
"Today a coup d'état is no longer as easy as it used to be," replied m y interlocuto r briskly .
"In 1864, at the time of Bismarck' s clash wit h the Prussia n Chamber , Prussia was a centralise d state, whereas toda y the Germa n Empir e is a federal state.
The centra l government woul d be taking too great a risk in attemptin g a coup d'état.
In order to be certain of bringin g it off, it would need the unanimous consen t of these differen t federa l governments .
If one of these failed to accept the coup d'état , it would be release d from its obligation s toward s the Empire , and that would mean the break-up o f federal state.
That is not all! The federal constitutio n is the only guarante e which the small states have agains t the domination o f Prussia ; in violatin g it themselves , they would be handing themselve s over, bound hand and foot, to the mercie s of the centra l power.
Is it likely that Bavaria would capitulat e to such an extent ? No, and to reserve myself on this point, I tell you this: 'To carry out a coup d'état in Germany , the empero r would have to have either the people on his side—an d he has not—o r all the confederate governments , and he will never have them all.
' " Engels' las t statement havin g failed to convinc e me, I insist on the possibilit y of a domesti c coup d'état .
"Oh," h e replied , "I am not saying that what I will call the revolution from above i s not a threat for the future .
Bebel and several o f our friend s have alread y said that they foresa w an attempted cou p agains t universa l suffrage.
" "In that case, would you answe r violenc e with violence? " "We woul d not be mad enoug h to walk into the trap set by the government t o catch us, becaus e there is nothin g the Germa n government woul d like more than an insurrection , in order to crush us .
We are all too well acquainte d with the curren t state of our force s and those of the governmen t to risk a game like that from shee r high spirits .
Moreover , would Willia m II dare to suppress universa l suffrag e completely? I do not think so.
Perhap s he would raise the voting age and bestow upon us the revised and corrected suffrage " (and in utterin g these words Engels started t o laugh) "whic h Belgiu m is about to experience.
" 482 "You do not fear the mass arrest of the oppositio n deputies? " "Oh!" exclaime d Engels, "no-one i n German y consider s such an event possible .
There are confederat e governments , such as Bavaria fo r example , which would never agree to sanctio n such a flagrant breac h of the constitution .
Do not lose sight of the fact that, fo r the small states, the imperia l constitutio n and the Reichstag ar e the only weapon s that can preven t their absorptio n by the Prussia n Government.
" We com e to the hypothesi s of a foreign diversion .
Engels is far from being pessimistic.
"Obviously," h e told me, "a war may occur.
But who, today, would dar e assum e responsibilit y for provokin g one, if not perhaps Russia , whose territory , becaus e of its enormou s area, cannot b e conquered ? And yet.
.
.
! At the momen t Russia is in such a situatio n that it could not keep up a war for four weeks unless it received mone y from abroad.
" * * * Here m y interlocuto r stoppe d for a moment , continuin g with a scarcely contained not e of anger: "I really do not understan d the French Government .
It is Russia that need s France , not France Russia .
Russia is ruined , its soil exhausted.
I f the French Governmen t saw the situatio n as it really is, it could obtain from Russia everythin g it wanted.
.
.
everything.
.
.
except mone y and efficien t militar y assistance .
Withou t France Russia woul d be isolated , completel y isolated .
And do not speak to me of the militar y might of the Russians ! Remembe r the Turkis h war.
Withou t the Roumanians , the Russian s would have been powerless befor e Plevna.
483 No, the more I think about it, the less I believe in war.
Its fortune s today are so uncertain ! The armies are place d in totally new condition s which defy all calculations .
There ar e rifles that fire ten round s a minute , whose range approaches tha t of a cannon and whose bullets are endowe d with unheard-of percussiv e force! There are melinit e and roburit e shells, etc.
! All these terribl e weapon s of destructio n have never been pu t to the test in wartime .
Therefor e we know nothin g at all about th e effect this revolutio n in armament s will have on tactics and on the morale of the troops .
"If Willia m II wished to launch himsel f into a war he would encounter resistanc e from his own genera l staff; he would be made to feel th e enormou s risks of war.
In the time of Napoleon II I it was possibl e to have localise d wars; today war would b e general , and Europe would be at the mercy of England, because Englan d could starve to death at will one or other of the belligerents.
Neithe r German y nor France produce s enough wheat within it s borders ; they are constraine d to import it from abroad .
In particula r they acquir e their provision s from Russia .
German y at war with Russia would not be able to obtain a single hectolitre .
On the other hand, France would be cut off from supplie s of Russian whea t by Centra l Europe enterin g the campaig n agains t her.
So that would leave only the sea-route s open.
But the sea, in wartime, woul d be more than ever in the grip of the English .
In return fo r a fee grante d to the companie s which run the variou s transoceanic services , the British Governmen t has at its disposa l vessels buil t under its control; s o that once war was declare d England woul d possess , apart from its powerfu l navy, fifty to sixty cruisers instructe d to preven t provision s from reachin g one or more of the belligerent s to whom it wished to declar e its opposition.
I f it remaine d neutra l it would still be the suprem e arbiter o f the situation .
While the belligerent s exhauste d them-selves fighting , Englan d would come along at the opportun e moment t o dictate the peace conditions .
Anyway , you need not worry abou t the possibilit y of a war provoke d by William II.
The German empero r has lost a lot of his old fire.

" * * * It remaine d for me to questio n Mr.
Engel s on one importan t matter : the chances o f the Germa n socialist s at the next elections .
"I am convinced, " he replied to this question , "that we will gain between 700,00 0 and one million votes more than in 1890.
Thus we shall pick up altogethe r two and a quarter million , if not two and a half million votes.
But the seats won will not correspon d to this figure.
.
.
.
If the seats had been shared out equally in the last Reichstag, afte r the election s which gave us one and a half million votes, we would have had eighty deputie s instead of thirty-six .
Since th e foundatio n of the empire , when the electora l district s were established , the distributio n of the populatio n has change d to our disadvantage .
The rule which governe d the formatio n of the electoral district s was this: one deputy per 100,00 0 inhabitants .
Now Berlin , which still only has six deputies , currentl y has a population i n excess of one and a half million .
Nowaday s Berlin should b e regularl y returnin g sixteen deputies .
Anothe r example : Cologne, whic h now has 250,00 0 inhabitants , still has only one deputy.
" "Will th e socialis t party have candidate s in all the constituencies? " "Yes, we shall have candidate s in all 400 constituencies .
It is important t o us that we should muste r our forces.
" "And wha t is your final goal as Germa n socialists? " Mr.
Engel s looks at me for a few moment s and then says: "Why, w e have no final goal.
We are evolutionaries, w e have no intention o f dictatin g definitiv e laws to mankind .
Prejudice s instead o f detaile d organisatio n of the society of the future? You will find no trace of that amongs t us.
We shall be satisfie d when we have placed the means of productio n in the hands of the community, an d we fully realise that this is quite impossibl e with the presen t monarchis t and federalis t government.
" I permit myself to observ e that the day when the Germa n socialist s will be in a position t o put their theorie s into practic e still seems a long way off to me.
"Not as far as you think," replied Mr.
Engels .
"For me the time is approachin g when our party will be called upon to take over the government.
Toward s the end of the century you may perhap s see this even t come about.
"Indeed, tak e the figure of our supporter s since the start of our parliamentary struggles .
There is a steady progressio n at each election.
Personall y I am convince d that, if the last Reichsta g had run the full legal term, that is to say if the election s had not taken place unti l 1895, we would have collecte d three and a half million votes.
Now there are ten million s elector s in Germany , and on average seve n millio n who vote.
With three and a half million electors ou t of seven million , the Germa n empire cannot continu e in its presen t form.
And .
.
.
do not forget this fact, which is very important: th e numbe r of our elector s tells us the numbe r of our supporters i n the army.
With one and a half million out of ten million elector s already, tha t is roughly a seventh of the populatio n in our favour , and so we can count on one soldier out of six.
When w e have three and a half million votes—whic h is not far off—we shal l have half the army.
" When I express doubt as to the loyalty of the socialis t troops in the army to their principle s in the event of revolution , Mr.
Engel s makes th e followin g statement, word :for-word: "The da y when we are in the majority , what the French army did instinctivel y in not firing on the people will be repeate d in our country quit e consciously .
Yes, whateve r the frightene d bourgeoi s say, we are able to calculat e the momen t when we shall have the majority o f the people behind us; our ideas are making headwa y everywhere, a s much amon g teachers , doctors , lawyers , etc.
as among th e workers .
If we had to start wieldin g power tomorrow , we shoul d need engineers , chemists , agronomists .
Well, it is my conviction tha t we would have a good many of them behin d us already.
I n five or ten years we shall have more of them than we need.
" And wit h these extremel y optimisti c words from him I took my leave of Mr.
Engels .

I found Herr Engel s at his house in Regent' s Park Road, jubilant , of course , over the result of the election s to the Germa n Reichstag .
"We hav e gained 10 seats," said he, in answer to my inquiries .
"On the first ballot we obtaine d 24 seats, and out of 85 of our men left in the second ballots , 20 were returned .
We gained 16 seats and lost 6, leaving us with a net gain of 10 seats.
We hold 5 out of the 6 seats in Berlin.
" "What is your gross poll?" "That w e shall not know until the Reichsta g meets, when the returns wil l be presented , but you may take it at somethin g over 2,000,000 votes .
In 1890 we polled 1,427,00 0 votes.
And you must remember tha t this is a purely socialis t vote.
All parties coalesce d against u s with the exceptio n of a small numbe r of the Volkspartei, which is a sort of Radical-Republica n party.
485 We ran 391 candidates , and we refuse d to make terms with any other party.
Ha d we cared to do so, we might have had 20 or 30 more seats, but we steadfastl y set our faces against any compromise , and that is what makes our positio n so strong .
None of our men are pledged t o suppor t any party or any measur e exceptin g our own party programme.
" "But surel y your 2,000,00 0 votes ought to have carried more seats?" "That is owing to the defects in the distributio n of seats.
When the Reichsta g was first created , we were suppose d to have equal electoral districts , with one membe r to every 100,00 0 inhabitants , but origina l inequalitie s and the growth and shiftin g of populatio n have mad e the numbe r of elector s in each distric t very unequal .
This tell s heavily agains t us.
Take the case of Liebknecht' s seat in 37-1550 Berlin.
H e polled 51,000 votes in a constituenc y which contain s some 500,00 0 inhabitants.
" "And ho w about the 6 seats you have lost?" "Well, ther e are circumstance s connecte d with each which explain thei r loss.
Breme n was always looked upon as a fluke in 1890.
In Lübeck, I have just heard from Bebel , many workin g people ar e away, and if the electio n had occurre d in the winter we should hav e held the seat.
Then, again, you must remembe r that trade depressio n affects us more than it does you, and we have had to fight agains t the bitter hostilit y of every employe r of labour .
Although votin g is by ballot, intereste d people have found out means nullifyin g its secrecy .
We don't vote markin g a paper, as you do in England , but by means of ballot papers , which each voter bring s with him.
The depressio n of trade, besides , and the cholera epidemi c of 1892, have compelle d number s of workin g men to accept public relief which disfranchise s them for the term of a year.
"But I am more proud of our defeat s than our victories, " continued Herr Engels .
"In Dresden (countr y district ) we came within 10 0 of the votes polled for a candidat e who receive d the suffrages o f every other party, and in a total poll of 32,000 .
In Ottenseen ou r candidat e came within 500 of a membe r who has been supporte d in the same way, on a gross poll of 27,000 .
In Stuttgart ou r candidat e polled 13,315 votes, and he was only 128 behind th e sitting member .
In Lübeck we were only 154 behind on a total poll of 19,000 .
And, as I said before , these are all socialist vote s polled agains t a combinatio n of all other parties.
" "Now, tel l me what is your politica l programme? " "Our programm e is very nearly identica l with that of the Social-Democratic Federatio n in England, 486 althoug h our policy is very different.
" "More nearl y approachin g that of the Fabian Society, 487 I suppose? " "No, certainl y not," replied the Herr, with grea t animation .
"The Fabia n Society , I take to be nothin g but a branch of the Liberal Party .
It looks for no social salvatio n except throug h the means whic h that party supplies .
We are oppose d to all the existing politica l parties , and we are going to fight them all.
The English Social-Democrati c Federatio n is, and acts, only like a small sect.
It is an exclusiv e body.
It has not understoo d how to take the lead of the working-clas s movemen t generally , and to direct it towards socialism .
It has turned Marxis m into an orthodoxy .
Thus it insiste d upon John Burns unfurlin g the red flag at the dock strike, wher e such an act would have ruined the whole movement , and, instea d of gaining over the dockers , would have driven them back int o the arms of the capitalists .
We don't do this.
Yet our programme i s a purely socialis t one.
Our first plank is the socialisation o f all the means and instrument s of production .
Still, we accep t anythin g which any governmen t may give us, but only as a paymen t on account , and for which we offer no thanks .
We always vot e against the Budget , and agains t any vote for money or men for the Army.
In constituencie s where we have not had a candidate t o vote for on the second ballot, our supporter s have been instructe d to vote only for those candidate s who pledge d to vote agains t the Army Bill, any increase d taxation , and any restriction o n popula r rights.
" "And wha t will be the effect of the electio n on Germa n politics? " "The Arm y Bill will be carried.
488 There is a complet e breakdown o f the Opposition .
In fact, we are now the only real and compac t Opposition .
The Nationa l Liberal s have joined the Conservatives.
Th e Freisinnige party ha s split into two, and the elections hav e all but annihilate d it.
The Catholic s and the small sections dar e not risk anothe r dissolution , and will give way sooner than fac e it.
" "Now, comin g to Europea n politics , what do you think will be the effect of the elections o n them? " "Well, th e Army Bill being voted , France and Russia will evidently d o somethin g in the same direction .
France has already absorbed al l her male populatio n into her Army, even down to those wh o are physicall y unfit, but she will no doubt go in for improving he r Army as a fighting machine .
Russia will be met with the difficult y of obtainin g officers .
Austria and German y will of cours e stick together.
" "Then ther e is rather an ugly outloo k for the peace of Europe? " "Of course , any little thing may precipitat e a conflict, but I don't think th e rulers of these countrie s are anxiou s for war.
The precision an d range of the new quick-firin g arms, and the introduction o f smokeles s powder , imply such a revolutio n in warfare tha t nobody can predic t what will be the proper tactics for a battle fought under these novel conditions .
It will be a leap in the dark .
And the armies confrontin g each other in future will be so immens e as to make all previou s wars mere child's play in comparison wit h the next war.
" 37* Appendices "And wha t do you think will be the influenc e of the Social-Democrati c Party in Europe?" "For peace , undoubtedly .
We have always proteste d agains t the annexation o f Alsace-Lorraine , and after Sedan Marx and I drew up an addres s of the International , pointin g out that the Germa n people ha d no quarre l with the French Republic , and demandin g peace on honourabl e terms, and also pointin g out exactly what has happened—that th e annexatio n would drive France into the arms of Russia , and would be a standin g menac e to the peace of Europe.
489 Ou r Party in the Reichsta g has always demande d that the Alsace-Lorrainer s should have the opportunit y given them to decide thei r future destiny—whethe r they should rejoin France , remain German , join Switzerland , or becom e independent.
" "Then yo u look for a 'United States of Europe ' at no distan t date?" "Certainly.
Everythin g is making in that direction .
Our ideas are spreading i n every Europea n country .
Here is" (producin g a thick volume) "ou r new review for Roumania.
3 We have a similar one for Bulgaria.
15 The worker s of the world are fast learnin g to unite.
" "Can you give me any figures to illustrat e the growth of socialis m in Germany? " Herr Engel s then produce d an elaborat e diagra m illustratin g the numbe r of votes polle d by each party at every electio n to the Reichsta g as at presen t constituted.
"In 1877" , he said, "we polled 500,00 0 votes; in 1881, owing to the rigou r of the Socialis t Law, 2 only 300,000 ; in 1884, 550,000 , and in 1890, 1,427,000 .
This time we have polled over 2,000,000.
" "And to what do you attribut e this marvellou s growth? " "Chiefly t o economi c causes .
We have had as great an industria l revolution i n German y since 1860, with all its attendan t evils, as you had in Englan d from 1760 to 1810.
Your manufacturer s know this very well.
Then, again, the presen t commercia l depressio n has affected ours , a new industria l country , more than yours, an old one.
Hence the pressur e on the workers .
I mean those of all classes.
Th e small tradesman , crushe d out by the big store, the clerk, th e artisan , the labourer , both in town and country , are beginning t o feel the pinch of our presen t capitalis t system .
And we place a scientifi c remed y before them, and as they can all read and thin k for themselves , they soon come round and join our ranks.
Our organisatio n is perfect—th e admiratio n and despai r of a Contemporanul.

It has been made perfec t owing to the Socialis t laws of Bismarck , which were very much like your coercio n laws for Ireland .
Then, again, our militar y trainin g and disciplin e is invaluable.
Th e whole of the 240,00 0 elector s of Hambur g received ou r electio n addresse s and literatur e in a quarter of an hour.
In fact, last year the governmen t of that town appeale d to us to help it in sendin g round instruction s as to how to deal with cholera.
" "Then yo u expec t soon to see, what everybod y is curiou s to see—a Socialis t Government i n power? " "Why not ? If the growth of our Party continue s at its norma l rate we shall have a majority betwee n the years 1900 and 1910.
And whe n we do, you may be assured we shall neither be short of ideas no r men to carry them out.
You people , I suppose , about that time , will be having a government , in which Mr.
Sidney Webb will be growin g gray in an attemp t to permeat e the Libera l Party.

We are permeating th e people.
" First publishe d in The Daily Chronicle, Reproduce d from the newspape r July 1, 1893 NOTES AND INDEXES NOTES 1 This article was inspire d by the major victory scored by the Social-Democrati c Party of German y in the first round of the genera l election s to the Reichsta g on February 20 , 1890.
The party polled 1,427,32 3 votes and receive d 20 (21 according t o initial electio n returns ) seats in the Reichstag .
On March 1, the Social Democrat s were successfu l at the run-off (a second ballot was held in the constituencies wher e none of the candidate s had receive d an absolut e majorit y in the first round) .
Engels learned th e outcom e of the second ballot after writing thi s article.
All in all, the Social Democrat s polled 1,427,29 8 votes and received 3 5 seats in the Reichstag .
The articl e in the Newcastle Daily Chronicle (Marc h 3, 1890) was preface d by the editorial introductio n cited below : "The followin g article has been contribute d by one of the most influentia l members o f the Germa n Socialisti c party.
By his long identificatio n with the party, hi s intimat e acquaintanc e with Karl Marx and the Socialisti c leader s generally, th e writer is well entitled to interpre t their views—perhap s better than any one else.
" Following publicatio n in the Newcastle Daily Chronicle, th e article was reprinted i n the Berliner Volksblatt on April 6, 1890, under the headin g "Ein Artikel Friedric h Engels" .
In the Germa n translation , the edge was taken off some of Engels' phrases due , as the editors explaine d in the introduction , to the Anti-Socialist La w then in force in the country .
p .
3 2 This refers to the Anti-Socialis t Law passed by the Reichsta g on Octobe r 21, 1878 fo r the purpos e of suppressin g the socialis t and the working-clas s movement.
I t banned all party organisations , mass workers ' association s and the socialist an d labou r press, and authorise d repressiv e action s agains t Social Democrats.
However , the Social-Democrati c Party, supporte d by Marx and Engels, had manage d to strike a balance betwee n undergroun d work and legal activities, an d to consolidat e and expan d its influenc e even in the years when the Anti-Socialis t Law was in force.
The Law's validity was extende d in 1881, 1884, 1886 and 1888, and it was repeale d on Octobe r 1, 1890.
Engels gave an assessment o f it in his essay "Bismarc k and the Germa n Workin g Men's Party" (present edition , Vol.
24, pp.
407-09.
) p .
3 558 3 Engels is apparentl y referrin g to the election s of 1878; despite the slande r hurled agains t the party by the reactionar y press, nine Social-Democrati c deputie s were elected , only three less than in 1877.
p .
3 4 The National Liberals, originall y a Prussian , and from 1871 an all-Germa n right-wing bourgeoi s politica l party that existed betwee n 1867 and 1918, a mainstay o f the Junker-bourgeoi s bloc.
Its programm e proclaime d civic equalit y and bourgeois-democrati c freedoms , but against the backgroun d of a stronge r working-class movemen t in Germany , it ceased campaignin g for these issues and declared it s satisfactio n with Bismarck' s half-hearte d reforms .
Followin g Germany's unification , it acquire d its final shape as a party first and foremos t of the big industria l bourgeoisie , and to all intents and purpose s went back on the liberal programm e it had previousl y advanced .
The Centre, a political party of Germa n Catholics , came into being in June 1870 as a result of the merge r betwee n the Catholi c groups in the Prussia n Landtag an d the Germa n Reichsta g (the seats occupie d by the deputie s from these group s were located in the centre of the assembl y halls).
The Centr e usually adhere d to a middle-of-the-roa d policy , manoeuvrin g betwee n the parties supportin g the governmen t and the left-win g oppositio n group s in the Reichstag.
I t used the banne r of Catholicis m to bring togethe r the Catholi c clergy, th e landowners , the bourgeoisi e and part of the peasantr y (i.
e.
, strata of different socia l standing) , mainly in the small and medium-size d states in Western an d South-Wester n Germany , and encourage d their separatis m and anti-Prussianism.
Th e Centre oppose d the Bismarc k government , but still voted in favou r of the steps it took agains t the working-clas s and socialis t movement .
Engels gave a detailed descriptio n of this party in his work "The Role of Force in History " (see presen t edition , Vol.
26, pp.
453-510) , and also in the essay "What Now? " (see this volume , pp.
7-10).
The Conservatives, a Prussia n Junke r party encompassin g the aristocracy , senior officers , and senior Luthera n clergy and civil servants , was founde d in 1848 to comba t the bourgeois-democrati c revolutio n of 1848-49 .
In the initial years afte r Germany' s unification , it stood in oppositio n to the Bismarc k government, criticisin g it from the Right.
Permeate d with the spirit of Prussia n hegemonism an d militarism , the party resiste d attempt s to introduc e bourgeoi s reforms.
I n 1866, the Party of Free Conservative s (or the Germa n Imperialists ) split from it.
The new party represente d the interest s of big landowner s and industrialists an d extende d unconditiona l suppor t to Bismarck .
p .
4 5 Engels is referrin g to two decree s issued by William II on Februar y 4, 1890, the eve of the election s to the Reichstag , and presentin g the government' s manifesto.
Th e decree s pointe d to the failure of Bismarck' s punitiv e measure s against th e working-clas s movemen t and to the transitio n to a more flexibl e policy combine d with stronge r social demagogy .
The first decree was addresse d to the Chancello r and instructe d him to pro-pose to some Europea n government s the conventio n of an internationa l con-ference t o discuss the introductio n of a single labour law.
Such a conferenc e did in fact take place in March 1890 in Berlin.
Apart from Germany , taking part in it were governmen t representative s from Britain , France , Austria-Hungary , Italy and other countries .
The conferenc e passed resolution s bannin g the em-ployment o f childre n under 12 and reducin g workin g hours for teenager s and women.
Bu t these resolution s were not bindin g on its signatories .
The secon d decree , addresse d to the Minister s of Public Works and of Commerce an d Industr y voiced the Emperor' s wish to revise the labour law of the time , supposedl y with a view to improvin g the condition s of worker s em-ployed a t state and privat e enterprises .
p .
4 6 This article , like the previou s one, was prompte d by the election s to the Reichstag, th e first round of which was held on Februar y 20, 1890 (see Note 1).
P.
7 7 The Cartel, a bloc of the Conservative s and the Free Conservative s with the National Liberal s (see Note 4), which was formed after Bismarc k had dissolve d the Reichsta g in Januar y 1887 and which supporte d his government .
The Cartel wa s victoriou s at the Februar y 1887 election s and receive d a majorit y (220) of the seats in the Reichstag .
Leanin g on the bloc, Bismarc k manage d to get a number of laws passed which promote d the interest s of the Junker s and big bourgeoisi e (introductio n of protectiv e tariffs, higher taxes, etc.
).
However , he failed to get the Anti-Socialis t Law extende d in 1890 (see Note 2).
Growin g discord betwee n the parties incorporate d in the Cartel and defeat at the 1890 elections ( a mere 132 seats) brough t about its collapse .
p .
7 8 The Deutsche Freisinnige Partei wa s formed i n 1884 as a result of the merge r of the Party of Progres s and the Left wing of the Nationa l Liberals .
Among its leaders wa s Eugen Richter , a deput y to the Reichstag .
The party repre -sented th e interest s of the middl e class and was in oppositio n to the Bis-marck government .
p .
8 9 The Guelphs—a part y establishe d in 1866 after Hanove r had joined Prussia .
The nam e derives from the old House of Guelphs .
The party's objectiv e was to reinstate th e rights of the Royal House of Hanove r and Hanover' s autonom y in the Germa n Empire .
It sided with the Centre .
The representative s of nationa l minoritie s (Poles , the inhabitant s of Alsace-Lorraine) an d in additio n the Hanoveria n Guelph s in the Reichsta g dissatisfied wit h the policy of nationa l oppression , allied themselve s with the major oppositio n parties and frequentl y acted in collaboratio n with the Party of the Centre .
p .
8 10 An ironica l referenc e to the outcom e of the Kulturkampf, a set of measure s introduced b y the Bismarc k governmen t in 1871-7 5 under a campaig n for secula r culture .
The main thrust of this campaig n (clergyme n were forbid -den to conduc t politica l agitatio n and to supervis e education ; nearly all Catholi c Orders wer e disbanded , the state appointe d Churc h leaders ) was directe d against th e Catholi c Churc h and the Party of the Centre (see Note 4), which were followin g an anti-Prussia n line.
However , the persecutio n and the blatant interference i n the interna l affairs of the Churc h only served to consolidat e clericalism.
Bismarck , who in May 1872 declare d in the Reichstag : "We shall not go to Canossa " was forced in the late 1870s to effect a reconciliatio n with the clerg y and repea l nearly all anti-Catholi c laws in order to unite all reactionary element s in a campaig n agains t the working-clas s movement .
The phras e "to go to Canossa " derive s from the humiliatin g pilgrimag e made by the Germa n Empero r Henry IV to the Castle of Canossa , Norther n Italy, in 1077 to plead with Pope Gregor y VII to revoke his decisio n that he be excommunicated.

9 13 Engels was prompte d to write the essay "The Foreig n Policy of Russia n Tsardom" b y the deterioratin g situatio n in Europe in the late 1880s-earl y 1890s and the mountin g threat of a world war engendere d by the formatio n of two military-political blocs , the Triple Allianc e (Germany , Austria-Hungar y and Italy), and the Franco-Russia n alliance , which was taking on definit e shape as the essa y was being written .
In the works written over that period Engels repeatedly deal t with problem s of militarism , chauvinism , competitio n in armaments an d the predator y policie s of Europea n states (see "Introductio n to Sigismund Borkheim' s Pamphle t In Memory of the German Blood-and-Thunder Patriots.

This work continue s his anti-militaris t campaig n sustaine d throug h the press and correspondence wit h socialist s in many countries .
It was prompte d by Vera Zasulich's reques t on behalf of the Russia n Marxis t Sotsial-demokrat magazin e (preparations fo r its publicatio n were underwa y in London ) for Engels' collaboration.
Engels responded b y sendin g his essay for publicatio n in Russia n (translated fro m the German) .
He also decided to simultaneousl y have it publishe d in other socialis t papers and magazine s (see Engels' letter to Vera Zasulic h of April 3, 1890, presen t edition , Vol.
48).
The firs t chapte r of the work was publishe d in the Sotsial-demokrat, No .
1, February 1890 , and the end, in its next issue which did not appear until August 1890.
Over that period , two chapter s were publishe d in the April issue of Die Neue Zeit with editoria l change s that Engels had not authorise d (e.
g.
, milder descriptions o f the Russia n and Germa n ruling circles and representative s of the Hohenzoller n dynasty , etc.
).
Engels learned abou t this editoria l interferenc e when he receive d the first book of the Sotsial-demokrat (c .
April 1, 1890) and compared th e Russia n translatio n with the Neue Zeit version.
H e strongl y protested agains t such treatmen t of his work and demande d that the first chapters b e reprinte d in conformit y with the origina l (see his letters to Kautsky , editor of the journal , and Dietz, its publisher , of April 1, 1890, present edition , Vol.
48).
In the May issue of the journal , these chapter s appeare d withou t changes togethe r with chapte r three; they were supplie d with an editoria l footnote b y the editors : "As a result of a misunderstanding , several deviation s from th e origina l occurre d in the publicatio n of chapter s I and II, which appeared i n the April issue, substantiall y affectin g the characte r of the article.
Our reader s will certainl y appreciat e it if, instead of correctin g individua l passages, w e reproduc e the entire article in its origina l form.
The presen t issue carries i t in full.
" The publicatio n was dated "London , late Februar y 1890" , when th e work was completed .

29 51 Engels is referrin g to the Greek revolt which began in the spring of 1821 and soon assume d a massiv e scale.
In Januar y 1822, the Nationa l Congres s convened i n Epidauru s proclaime d Greek independenc e and adopte d a constitution.
Th e Sultan of Turkey , who was unable to suppres s the insurgen t Greeks relyin g solely on his own forces, called in his vassal, the Egyptia n ruler Mehemet Ali , whose troop s invade d Morea in 1825, severely putting down the Greek revolt .
At the outset of the uprising , the Holy Alliance , notably Russia , took a very negativ e stand toward s it.
However , the tremendou s sympath y that the Greeks ' struggl e arouse d everywhere , and, most important , a chance to use it to consolidat e their positio n in the south of the Balkan s prompte d Britain , Russia an d Franc e to recognis e Greec e as a country at war and rende r it military aid .
Of decisiv e significanc e was the victor y of Russia in the Russo-Turkish wa r of 1828-29 , which mean t that Turke y was forced to recognise Greec e as an independen t state.
However , a decision was taken by the European power s to establis h monarch y in Greec e in 1832, with the throne going to Otto, second son of King Louis of Bavaria .
p .

The revolutionar y movemen t in these countrie s was suppresse d as a result of interventio n by the Holy Allianc e which sen t French troops to Spain and Austria n troops to Italy.
p .
30 53 These congresse s of the Holy Allianc e took place in Aix-la-Chapell e (Aachen ) in 1818, Troppa u (Opava ) in 1820, Laibach (Ljubljana ) in 1821, and Veron a in 1822.
Their decision s were aimed at suppressin g bourgeois-democrati c revolu -tions an d the nationa l liberatio n movement s in Europea n countries .

The battle wa s fought after the Turkis h comman d had refuse d to end the massacr e of the Greek population .
The forces of the three Europea n powers , commanded b y the British Vice-Admira l Edwar d Codrington , routed the Turko-Egyptian fleet .

It began on November 29 , 1830 in Warsa w as a military coup d'éta t but soon assume d a popular characte r and led to the withdrawa l of Russia n troops .
However , the aristocracy a t the helm of the Polish governmen t and in the army remaine d passive an d obstructe d the involvemen t of the masses in the nationa l liberatio n movement.
Representative s of bourgeois-democrati c quarter s failed to get serfdom abolished , which deprive d the insurrectio n of peasan t support .
The hostilities, whic h began in Februar y 1831 , eventuall y forced the Polish government t o capitulat e on Septembe r 8 and surrende r Warsaw to the tsarist forces.
Althoug h the Polish insurrectio n was smashed , it nevertheles s made a great contributio n to the nationa l liberatio n struggl e of the Polish people and was of major internationa l significance .
It foiled the plans for a campaig n against th e Frenc h revolutio n of 1830 and promote d the advanc e of the revolutionary movemen t in many Europea n countries .

Prior to that, in the spring of the same year, Russian troops ha d landed in Unkiar-Skelessi , on the Bosphorus , to help protec t the Turkish capita l from the army of Ibrahim Pasha , son of Mehemet Ali , the ruler of Egyp t who had rebelle d agains t the Sultan of Turkey .
In May 1833, the Porte conclude d peace with Meheme t Ali through th e mediatio n of Britain and France, cedin g Syria and Palestin e to Egypt.
However , the Russian government , taking advantag e of the tense situatio n and the presenc e of Russia n troops in Turkey, induce d the Porte to conclud e a defence treaty with Russia which contained a secret clause obligin g Turke y to close the Straits to all foreign warships excep t Russia n ones.
This clause remaine d in force until the Turko-Egyptian wa r of 1839-41 , when Nichola s I was compelle d to agree to the closure o f the Straits to non-Turkis h warship s in peacetime .

34 59 The start of the new Turko-Egyptia n war (1839-41 ) led to the mountin g controversy betwee n Britai n and France , with the latter extendin g secret assistance t o Egyptia n ruler Meheme t Ali.
Fearing Russia' s unilatera l interven -tion in the conflic t on the side of the Sultan , Britain manage d to persuad e the Western power s to offer the Porte collectiv e militar y assistance .
On July 15, 1840, Britain, Russia, Prussia , Austria and Turkey , leaving out France , signed a convention i n Londo n on assistanc e to the Sultan of Turkey .
A threat of war between Franc e and the coalitio n of Europea n states arose; however , France thought bette r of it and agreed not to suppor t Meheme t Ali.
As a result of British an d Austria n militar y intervention , Meheme t AH was forced to give up his possession s outside Egypt and submi t to the Sultan' s suprem e rule.

The Règlement, based on a draft framed by P.
D.
Kiselev , head of the Russia n administration , was adopte d by an assembl y of boyar s and clergymen .
Legislativ e power in each of the Principalitie s was vested in an assembl y elected by the big landowners .
Executiv e power was in the hand s of the hospodars , rulers elected for life by representative s of the landowners, th e clergy and the towns.
The Règlement envisaged a number of bourgeois reforms : abolitio n of interna l custom s duties, introductio n of free trade an d the right of peasant s to move from one owner to another .
However , in view of the preservatio n of serfdom and concentratio n of politica l power in the hand s of the big landowner s and the boyars , the progressiv e forces in the Principalities regarde d the Règlement a s a symbol o f feudal stagnation .
It was repealed durin g the 1848 revolution .

Their purpos e was to settle relation s betwee n the two countrie s whose competitio n for hegemon y in German y grew fiercer after the revolutio n of 1848-49 .
Austri a sough t to restor e the Germa n Confederation , the association o f Germa n states establishe d by the Vienna Congress , which to all intents an d purpose s had fallen apart at the time of the revolution , while Prussia wa s hoping to consolidat e its supremac y by formin g a union of Germa n states unde r its own domination , a plan that was oppose d by Austri a and provoked th e irritatio n of Russia and France .
On Novembe r 29, 1850, a treaty was signed in Olmütz (Olomouc) , Moravia, under whic h Prussia gave up the idea of a unilatera l revision of the situatio n in Germany.
Th e Treaty of Olmütz wa s the last victory for Austria n diplomac y in the struggl e with Prussia .
It was abrogate d as a result of the Austro-Prussia n war of 1866 which led to the formatio n of the North Germa n Confederatio n under Prussia n domination .

The rapprochemen t betwee n Bonapartis t France and tsarist Russia, which first mad e itself felt at the Paris Congress , led to a secret Franco-Russia n treaty signed o n March 3, 1859 on Napoleo n Ill's initiative .
Tsar Alexande r II undertook t o rende r Napoleo n III diplomati c assistanc e in the latter' s preparations fo r the militar y rout of Austria , and to move Russian troops to the Austrian borde r in the event of war so as to immobilis e part of the Austria n army in the east.
In return , Napoleo n III, acting in the spirit of the treaty, committed himsel f to continue d suppor t for Russia' s policy in the Balkans .

France obtaine d Savoy and Nice, and Lombard y was annexe d to Piedmont .
However, throughou t 1860, the struggl e for unificatio n continue d to mount.
Th e heroic armed action s of Garibaldi' s volunteer s supporte d by the populace overthre w the Bourbo n dynast y in Sicily and Naples , and the south of Italy was united with Piedmon t in a single Kingdo m of Italy.

It entailed a growth of Russian influenc e in the Balkans, provoke d sharp oppositio n on the part of Britain and Austria -Hungary an d won Germany' s tacit approval .
Under pressur e from these powers, th e Russia n governmen t was forced to submit the treaty for revision to an internationa l congress , held in Berlin betwee n June 13 and July 13, 1878 and comprisin g representative s of Russia, Germany , Austria-Hungary , France , Britain, Ital y and Turkey .

Takin g part in it were peasants , craftsme n and a significan t part of the feuda l nobility .
Among the reason s for its failure were the British militar y superiority, difference s among the insurgent s as to the goals of the uprisin g (especially th e peasant s and the nobility , with the latter receivin g some concessions fro m the British) , and significan t feudal , religiou s and caste distinctions, whic h were deliberatel y played up by the colonialists , who isolate d the centr e of the uprising .
Marx and Engels devoted numerou s essays and letters to the event making an in-dept h analysi s of the causes, motive forces and the reason s for the failure of the uprising , tracing the course of the hostilitie s in detail , and examinin g the principa l battles and other events (see presen t edition, Vol .

Seven of the defendant s were sentence d to terms of imprisonmen t of three to six years.
Marx guided the defenc e from Londo n by sendin g material s exposin g the provocativ e methods o f the prosecution ; after the trial he showed up its organiser s for what they reall y were (see Marx's pamphle t Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, an d also Engels' article "Th e Late Trial at Cologne" , presen t edition, Vol .

60 91 The Geneva Congress of the First International, th e first congres s of the International Workin g Men's Association , was held on Septembe r 3-8, 1866.
Taking par t in it were 60 delegate s from the Genera l Counci l and section s and workers' societie s from Britain , France , German y and Switzerland .
The congress wa s chaired by Herman n Jung.
The officia l report of the Genera l Council wa s Marx's Instructions for the Delegates of the Provisional General Council.
The Different Questions (se e presen t edition , Vol.
20, pp.
185-94) .
The Proudhonists, wh o had one-thir d of the votes, set against the Instructions thei r own programm e coverin g all items on the agenda .
However , the Genera l Council supporter s outvote d them on most issues.
Six out of nine points in the Instructions (o n the internationa l combinatio n of effort, on limitatio n of the working da y to 8 hours, on juvenil e and women' s labour , on co-operativ e labour, o n trades ' unions, and on standin g armies ) were approve d as congres s resolutions.
Th e Genev a congres s also endorse d the General Rules and Administrative Regulations of the International Working Men's Association.
On July 14-20, 1889, an International Socialist Workers' Congress too k place in Paris, which in point of fact was the inaugura l congres s of the Secon d International.
Preparation s for the congres s had been made agains t the background o f persisten t struggle s betwee n the Marxists , led by Engels, and the French opportunist s (Possibilists ) togethe r with their follower s in the British Social Democrati c Federation , who tried to take over the preparation s for the congress.
However , it became eviden t at the congres s that the Marxis t parties were in the majority .
The congres s opened on July 14, 1889, the centenar y of the stormin g of the Bastille .
It was attende d by 393 delegate s representin g nearly al l the workers ' and socialis t parties and organisation s of the time from 20 Europea n and America n countries .
The Possibilist s convene d their own, parallel congress , which opened in Paris on the same day.
However , it had very lliAe success , and the reformist s eventuall y had to give up the idea of establishing a n internationa l association .
The congres s pointe d out that the emancipatio n of labour could be attaine d only by the proletaria t capturin g politica l power with a view to expropriatin g capitalists an d socialisin g the means of production .
The congres s heard report s from representative s of the socialis t parties on the working-clas s movemen t in their countrie s and worke d out the foundation s of internationa l labour law, calling for the 8-hour workin g day and made a number o f other improvement s in industria l workin g condition s throug h international legislation .
The congres s advocate d the disbandmen t of standin g armies an d the armamen t of the people .
It passed a decision to mark May 1, 1890 in all countrie s by demonstration s and meeting s in defenc e of the deman d for the 8-hour day and other demand s put forward by the congres s for labour legislation.

60 The articl e "May 4 in London " was devoted to the first celebratio n of May Day, the day of internationa l solidarit y among the workin g people , held by the socialist partie s and workers ' organisation s in conformit y with the decisio n of the Internationa l Socialis t Workers ' Congres s of 1889 in Paris (see Note 91).
Mass demonstration s and meetings , which were best organise d in Austria , were hel d under the banner of the campaig n for the legalise d 8-hour working day.
A high level of organisatio n also characterise d the May Day demonstratio n staged b y Londo n worker s on the first Sunda y of the month , May 4.
Notwithstanding th e attempt s of reformis t trade-unio n leader s and the British opportunist socialis t Henry Hyndma n to stage-manag e the demonstratio n and make it advanc e conciliator y slogans , it testifie d to the readines s of Londo n workers t o fight for a socialist programme .
The bulk of the participants , about 200,000 i n number , supporte d the demand s advance d by the British Marxists .
Unskilled worker s employe d at gas works and the Londo n docks played the principal par t in the demonstration , they were the first to launch a campaig n for the formatio n of new mass trade unions in the 1880s (see Note 93) and the 8-hour day.
Engels attended th e meetin g in Hyde Park that conclude d the demonstration, wit h Eleano r Marx-Aveling , Edwar d Aveling , Paul Lafargu e and Serge i Kravchinsk y (Stepnyak) , the representativ e of the Russian revolution -ary émigrés, giving speeches .

61 93 The Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union wa s the first union of unskille d workers i n the history of the British labour movement .
It was formed in late March-early Apri l 1889 agains t the backgroun d of a mountin g strike movement.
A major contributio n to the foundatio n and work of the union was made by Eleano r Marx-Avelin g and Edwar d Aveling .
The Union campaigne d for the 8-hour day.
Within a short time, it became very influential : it was joined by up to 100,00 0 gaswork s employee s in the space of a year.
The union was actively involve d in organisin g the Londo n docks strike of 1889.
The London docks strike, whic h lasted from Augus t 12 to Septembe r 14, 1889, was one of the major events in the British labour movemen t of the late 19th century .
It involve d 30,000 docker s and over 30,000 worker s in other trades, th e bulk of them unskille d and not belongin g to any union .
The strikers' persistenc e and organisatio n were instrumenta l in obtainin g wage rises, and improve d workin g conditions .
The docks strike strengthene d proletaria n solidarity (abou t £50,00 0 was donate d to the strike fund) and organisation ; dockers' an d other unskille d worker s "new" unions were set up, recruitin g 200,000 member s within a year.
In the next year, the numbe r of trade unions more tha n doubled .

They unite d bourgeoi s radical s and workers .
In the poore r section s of London, lik e the East End, the clubs were predominantl y proletarian .
They criticised th e Irish policy pursue d by Gladstone' s Libera l government , demanded greate r democrac y (broade r suffrag e and other reforms) .
In the early 1880 s the Radica l clubs began to popularis e socialis t ideas.
In 1885, the Radical club s of Londo n merge d to form the Metropolita n Radica l Federation .

P.
William O'Brien .
Taking part in the demonstratio n were abou t 80,000-100,00 0 people .
Since on Novembe r 8, the Londo n police had prohibite d meeting s in Trafalga r Square , declarin g it crown property , 4,000 policeme n tried to dispers e the demonstratio n using truncheons .
Several hundred peopl e were injured , three beaten to death , and some of the organisers arrested .
These events went down in the history of the British labour movement a s the Bloody Sunday .

62 96 The Silvertown strike (name d after a district in the East End) was mounte d in September-December 188 9 by employee s of the Indiarubbe r Company' s works.
The strikers , about 3,000 people in all, demande d higher hourly and piece-rat e wages, mor e money for work on holiday s and overtime , and higher wages for children an d women .
Eleano r Marx-Avelin g helped organis e the strike and in the cours e of it founde d a young workin g women' s union.
The strike, which lasted fo r nearly three months , was unsuccessful , mainly becaus e it was not supported b y other trade unions .
p .
62 97 Engels is referrin g to the gas workers ' strike in the south of London , which lasted fro m Decembe r 1889 to Februar y 1890.
It was triggere d off by the company owners ' failure to honou r their promis e to introduc e the 8-hour day, raise wage s and give employmen t only to member s of the Gas Workers ' Union, as well as by the sackin g of three Union activists .
p .
62 98 The Social Democratic Federation, a British socialis t organisatio n set up in Augus t 1884 as a result of the reorganisatio n of the Democrati c Federatio n which had existed sinc e 1881.
It united socialis t element s of varyin g complexion , predominantly intellectual s and some politicall y active workers .
Its programm e set forth the deman d for collectivisatio n of the means of production , distributio n and exchange.
Th e leadershi p of the Federatio n was dominate d by H.
Hyndma n and his follower s who tended toward s authoritarianis m and denied the need to carry on work in the trade unions .
A group of revolutionar y Marxist s within it, including Eleano r Marx-Aveling , Edwar d Aveling , William Morri s and Tom Mann, advocate d closer contact s with the mass working-clas s movement .
In December 1884 , the difference s in the Federatio n on tactics and internationa l cooperation resulte d in its split and the foundin g of an independen t organisation, th e Socialis t League .
The Possibilists belonge d to a trend in the French socialis t movemen t whose leaders declare d the principl e of the transformatio n of the capitalis t system into a socialis t one throug h gradua l reform s and advocate d a "policy of possibilities".

Its followers , known as Free Traders , advocate d the removal o f protectiv e tariffs and non-interventio n by the state in the economy .
The centr e of the Free Traders ' agitatio n was Manchester , where the movement wa s led by Richar d Cobde n and John Bright .
In the 1860s, the Free Traders forme d the Left wing of the Libera l Party.
By "the Manchesteris m of the old Trade s Unions" , Engels means th e bourgeois-reformist characte r of their activities .
Seekin g to confin e the proletariat's goal s to economi c action for shorter workin g hours, higher wages, and change s in labour law for the workers ' benefit , the leaders of these trade unions diverte d the proletaria t from the struggl e for the class goals of the labour movement , oppose d the workers ' politica l action and preache d class harmony wit h the bourgeoisie .

66 01 Engels wrote th e "Draf t of a Reply to the Editor s of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung" following th e attemp t of the editoria l board, which was made up of member s of the "Young " oppositio n group , to presen t his work as supporting th e newspaper' s campaig n agains t the policie s pursue d by the German Social-Democrati c leadership .
In late Augus t 1890 the material s carried b y the newspaper , which had an independen t status, placed it under the party and resulte d in the resignatio n of its editoria l board which tried, in its farewell article , to presen t this as a consequenc e of a build-u p of "petty -bourgeois parliamentar y socialism " in the party and to take advantag e of Engels' authority t o promot e its own ends.
The indignan t Engels felt compelle d to deal a public rebuff to the "Young" .
This versio n of the reply to the editors of the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung wa s not complete d and exists as a rough draft.
The final version (see the followin g item) wa s printed by Der Sozialdemokrat, the Berliner Volksblatt and the Sächsische Arbeiter-Zeitung and wen t a long way toward s exposin g the "Young's " true colours.
Engels' reply wa s also carrie d by the Arbeiter-Zeitung, No.
38, September 19 , 1890.
The "Young"— a petty-bourgeoi s semi-anarchis t oppositio n group in German Socia l Democracy , which finally took shape in 1890.
At that time, its leadership wa s made up of student s and aspirin g writers (hence the name of the opposition) , who claime d the role of party theorist s and leader s for themselves.
Amon g the "Young's " leaders were Paul Ernst, Paul Kampffmeyer , Hans Müller, and Brun o Wille.
Failing t o realise that the condition s of party work ha d change d followin g the repeal of the Anti-Socialis t Law, the "Young " refused t o emplo y legal method s of struggle , oppose d the Social Democrats ' participation i n parliamentar y election s and the use of parliamentar y methods , and accuse d the party and its leadershi p of defendin g the interest s of petty-bourgeoisie, opportunism , and a departur e from democrati c principles .
In Octobe r 1891, the Erfurt congres s of the Social-Democrati c Party of Germany expelle d some of the oppositio n leader s from the party.
p.
67 Engels is referrin g to the addres s to the Germa n worker s issued by the Social-Democratic grou p in the Reichsta g on April 13, 1890, in connectio n with the celebratio n of May Day resolve d by the Paris Internationa l Socialis t Workers' Congres s of 1889 (see Note 91).
The addres s was publishe d in the Berliner Volksblatt on April 15, 1890.
It was the party leadership' s reply to the demand b y the "Young " oppositio n for a general strike on May 1 which had been mad e public on March 23.
It pointed out the danger s of such a course while the Anti-Socialis t Law was still in force and in the situatio n created by the elections o f Februar y 20, 1890, with its feasibilit y of provocatio n from the reactionary authoritie s which were eager for any excus e to smash the Social-Democratic Party .
The addres s warned the Germa n worker s not to give any excus e for provocations , to abando n the idea of a general strike, stop work only whe n a serious conflic t was clearly impossibl e and confin e themselve s elsewhere t o demonstration s and meetings .
On May 1, strikes involvin g over 10-per cen t of the workforc e took place in a number of cities.
On May 1, Hambur g constructio n worker s launche d a strike that lasted into July.
Th e striker s demande d a 9-hour workin g day and a pay rise.
The employers carrie d out their threat of a lockout and the strike failed, the trade union fund s having run out.
However , the employer s failed to introduc e a ban on worker s joining the trade unions .
p .
68 In the years when the Anti-Socialis t Law was in force (see Note 2), the Social-Democratic grou p in the Reichsta g was the only legal body that could assume leadershi p of the party.
An attemp t was made to have the group' s supremacy ove r the party's electiv e bodies perpetuate d in the Rules even after the repea l of the Law.

68 The London Conference of the First International wa s held from Septembe r 17 to 23, 1871.
Convene d agains t the backgroun d of harsh reprisal s agains t the International's member s followin g the defeat of the Paris Commune , this Conference wa s held behin d closed doors and was not very representative : taking par t in it were 22 voting delegate s and 10 withou t the right to vote.
The countries tha t were unable to send a delegate were represente d by correspond -ing secretaries .
Marx represente d Germany , and Engels Italy.
Al l in all, nine closed session s were held.
The report s were not intende d for publication .
The Conference resolution s were made public in Novembe r and Decembe r 1871.
For the Conference' s materials , see presen t edition , Vol.
22, pp.
409-31 .
The Londo n Conferenc e was a landmar k in Marx's and Engels' efforts t o found a proletaria n party.
It adopte d a resolutio n "On the Politica l Action of the Workin g Class" , which describe d the need to establis h an independen t workers' Part y as a fundamenta l principl e of the internationa l working-clas s movement.
Th e Hagu e Congres s of the Internationa l (1872) decide d to incorporate th e main part of the resolutio n into the Genera l Rules of the International Workin g Men's Association .
Other Conferenc e resolution s set out major tactica l and organisationa l principle s of a proletaria n party.
Approva l of these resolution s signifie d a victory for Marxis m in the International .
At its congres s in Sonvillie r held on Novembe r 12, 1871, the Bakuninis t Jura Federatio n adopte d the Circulaire à toutes les Fédérations de lAssociation internationale des travailleurs, which demande d immediat e convocation of a congress o f the Internationa l in view of the fact that the Conferenc e was not entitled t o pass decision s pertainin g to the rules and organisationa l principle s of the Association .
In actua l fact, the Sonvillie r Circula r was designe d to undermine th e authorit y of the Genera l Counci l in the Internationa l Workin g Men's Association .

68 The referenc e is to the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy (L'Alliance internationale d e la de'mocrati e socialiste ) founded b y Mikhai l Bakuni n in Geneva i n Octobe r 1868.
Its petty-bourgeoi s anarchis t programm e demande d recognition o f the equalit y of classes and abolitio n of the state.
Member s of the Alliance denie d the need for politica l action by the workin g class.
Organisation -ally, the Allianc e was based on the unconditiona l subordinatio n of the rank-and-file member s to a tiny group of "initiated" .
Having been denie d admittance t o the Internationa l in March 1869, the Bakuninist s declare d the dissolution o f the Allianc e while in fact preservin g it and workin g their way into the Internationa l under the guise of the Geneva section .
The Alliance , with Bakunin a t its head, plotted and campaigne d agains t Marx and Engels seeking to gain contro l over the Genera l Council .
The Allianc e steppe d up its activitie s agains t the Internationa l after the defeat o f the Paris Commune , when Bakuni n and his follower s attacke d the idea of the dictatorshi p of the proletaria t and the consolidatio n of an independent working-clas s politica l party.

Thi s governmen t deman d provoke d a controvers y within the Social-Democratic grou p in the Reichstag .
The Left wing heade d by Bebel and Liebknecht took Engels' advice an d oppose d it.
The opportunis t majorit y in the group, includin g Johann Heinric h Wilhel m Dietz, F.
Frohme and C.
Grillen -berger, intended t o vote for the subsidie s under the false pretex t of wishing to promote internationa l contacts .
Under pressur e from the majority , the group passed a decision which stated that the issue of subsidie s was of no great importance, an d gave each membe r of the group a right to vote as he saw fit.
It declared th e intentio n of the majorit y of Social-Democrati c deputie s to vote for the subsidies .
The stan d taken by the Right wing was unequivocall y censure d by the bulk of party member s and its centra l organ, Der Sozialdemokrat, whose struggl e against th e opportunist s was warml y supporte d by Engels.
Sharp criticis m forced th e majorit y to somewha t modify their attitud e to the governmen t plan at the time it was debate d in the Reichsta g in March 1885, making suppor t by the grou p conditiona l on the Reichstag' s acceptanc e of a numbe r of its proposals (e.
g.
, that the ships to be used on such routes be built at Germa n shipyards).
Whe n the Reichsta g rejecte d them, the entire Social-Democrati c group vote d agains t the project , which, however , was passed by a majority vote.

Notwithstanding reprisal s and police obstruction , the Neue Rheinische Zeitung staunchly defende d revolutionar y democrac y and the interest s of the pro-letariat.
I n May 1849, with the counter-revolutionar y element s in the midst of a massive offensive , the Prussia n governmen t used the fact that Marx was not a citizen o f that state to issue a deportatio n order agains t him.
Marx' s deportation, a s well as repressiv e measure s against other editors , eventuall y led to the paper's closure .
The last issue, No.
301, was printed in red and appeare d on May 19, 1849.
The editors ' farewel l addres s to the worker s read in part: "Their las t word everywher e and always will be: emancipation of the working classl" (se e presen t edition , Vol.

76 U8 The congres s of the Socialis t Workers ' Party of German y in Wyde n (Switzerland) wa s held from Augus t 20 to 23, 1880, with 56 delegate s present .
That wa s the first illegal congres s of the Germa n Social Democrat s followin g the introductio n of the Anti-Socialis t Law.
The convocatio n showe d that the party leadershi p had surmounte d the uncertaint y and confusio n caused by the dramatic change s in the condition s of its work.
The congres s criticise d the anarchist stan d of Johann Most an d Wilhelm Hasselmann , who rejecte d all legal mean s of struggle , advocate d individua l terror and launche d an open campaign agains t the party leadership , and expelle d them from the party.
The congress unanimousl y decide d to strike out the word "legal " from the statement, containe d in Part II of the programm e adopte d in 1875 in Gotha, that the party was workin g to attain its goals "with all legal means" .
The congress confirme d Der Sozialdemokrat as the party's official organ.

77 u9 Engels is referrin g to the statemen t [Erklärung] issued by the Social-Democrati c group in the Reichsta g (printe d by Der Sozialdemokrat, No.
14, April 2, 1885) in connection wit h the disagreement s betwee n the majorit y of the parliamentar y group an d the paper' s editoria l board over the stance to be adopte d on the government bil l on subsidie s to shippin g companie s (see Note 106).
The group questioned th e right of the party organ to criticis e its actions , calling the position occupie d by it an unjustifie d attack.
After this statemen t was publishe d in the newspaper , its editoria l board began to receiv e numerou s letters of protest fro m party member s both in German y and abroad , as well as resolutions o f protest of local party branches .
The majorit y in the parliamen -tary grou p was forced to retreat .
A joint statemen t by the editoria l board and the Social-Democrati c group, printed by the paper on April 23, 1885, said that any attemp t to restric t criticis m constitute d a departur e from the party' s principles an d a blow at its foundations .

89 131 The congres s of representative s of Hungaria n workers ' organisation s held on December 7 and 8, 1890 in Budapes t was an importan t event in the history of the Hungaria n working-clas s and socialis t movement .
It was attende d by 121 delegate s (87 from Budapes t and 34 from provincia l branches) .
The congress discusse d the state of the working-clas s movemen t in Hungary , the political positio n and the rights of workers , their attitud e to social reforms , the condition o f the rural proletariat , the trade unions , etc.
It adopte d a declaration o f principle s (party programme ) based on the main provision s of the programm e of the Austria n Social Democrat s approve d by the Hainfeld Congress o f 1888 (see Note 181).

89 132 Engels expressed his gratitude for the letter sent to him on Novembe r 28, 1890 on the occasio n of his 70th birthda y by the member s of the executiv e of the German Workers ' Educationa l Society in London .
The (Communist) German Workers' Educational Society i n Londo n was founde d in 1840 by Karl Schapper , Joseph Moll togethe r with other leaders of the League of the Just.
Marx and Engels were activel y involve d in its work in 1847 and 1849-50.
O n Septembe r 17, 1850, they and some of their follower s left the Society whic h had come to be dominate d by the sectaria n and adventuris t Willich-Schapper grou p who were responsibl e for the split in the Communis t League.
Fro m the late 1850s, Marx and Engels onc e again contribute d to the work of the Society .
When the First Internationa l was founded , the Society , with Friedrich Lessne r among it s leaders , becam e one of its sections .
The London Educationa l Society existed up to 1918, when it was closed down by the British government .
p .
91 133 Engels wrote thi s preface to the first edition of Marx's work Critique of the Gotha Programme (se e presen t edition , Vol.
24, pp.
75-99) and had it printed in Die Neue Zeit i n connection wit h the forthcomin g discussio n in the party press of a new part y programm e [Programm der deutschen Arbeiterpartei] to be adopte d at the next congres s of the Germa n Social Democrats .
Engels hoped tha t the publication o f this work would safeguar d the party agains t repeatin g the mistakes o f the Gotha programme an d dispel the reformis t illusion s associate d with the still persistin g cult of Lassalle.
Given th e pressur e of censorship , Engels considered i t necessar y to make certain omission s and to take the edge off the most pointed phrase s (see MEGA , 1/25, S.
540-44) .
In undertakin g the publication o f this most importan t programm e documen t of scientifi c commu -nism, whic h was exemplar y in the way it combatte d opportunism , Engels sought to deal a blow at the opportunis t element s amon g the Germa n Social Democrats, whic h were becomin g more active at that time.
That was all the more importan t as at the Erfurt congres s the party was going to discuss and adopt a new programm e to replac e that endorse d at Gotha (see Not e 183).
The wor k was frowne d upon by the Social-Democrati c group in the Reichstag an d the Vorwärts editorial board , but, as Engels had expected , the party itsel f and socialist s in other countrie s welcome d it.
The Critique of the Gotha Programme an d Engels' preface wer e not reprinte d in his lifetime .
In its origina l version , withou t Engels' deletions, th e text of the Critique of the Gotha Programme wa s first publishe d in 1932 in the USSR in the Russian translatio n from a copy of Marx's manuscrip t made by Louise Kautsky .
The publicatio n in the presen t edition (Vol.
24) is based on Marx's origina l manuscript.

92 134 The Unity Congres s in Gotha held on May 22-27, 1875, effected a merger of the two trends in the Germa n working-clas s movement , the Social-Democrati c Workers' Part y (the Eisenachers ) heade d by Augus t Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, and the Lassallea n Genera l Associatio n of Germa n Workers .
Prior to the congress , there had been a long struggl e betwee n the Eisenachers , who on the whole adhere d to scientifi c communism , and the Lassalleans , who advocated a kind of petty-bourgeoi s socialis m and refuse d to recognis e the need for economi c action and the establishmen t of trade unions .
Up to 1890, the unite d party was called the Socialis t Workers ' Party of Germany .
This healed th e rift in the Germa n workin g class.
When in Februar y 1875 the common platfor m (the draft Rules and especiall y the Programme ) was worked out, the Eisenachers ' leadershi p agreed to an ideologica l compromis e with the Lassalleans submittin g to the Germa n workers ' quest for unity and seekin g to attain it at any price.
Welcomin g the establishmen t of a united socialis t party, Marx an d Engels nevertheless oppose d the ideologica l compromis e with the Lassalleans an d subjecte d the erroneou s provision s of the programm e to sharp criticism.
This , however , did not preven t the congres s from approvin g it with only ver y minor changes .
p .
92 135 The congres s of the Germa n Social Democrat s held on Octobe r 12-18, 1890 in Halle wa s the first one followin g the repeal of the Anti-Socialis t Law'.
Taking part in it were 413 delegate s and 17 guests from abroad .
The congres s adopte d new Rule s measurin g up to the task of turnin g the party into a mass organisation o f the workin g class under condition s of legality .
It rejecte d the Lassallean part y programm e in force at the time and, on Wilhelm Liebknecht' s suggestion, passe d a decision on the preparatio n of a new draft programm e for the next party congres s in Erfurt .
This was to be publishe d three month s before th e congres s for the purpos e of discussin g it in local party branche s and the press .
The congres s recognise d the Berliner Volksblatt as the new party organ an d the party assume d a new name , the Social-Democrati c Party of Germany.
p .
92 136 The Hague Congress of the International Working Men's Association too k place on September 2-7 , 1872.
Its task was to reach decision s that would consolidat e the resolutions passe d by the Londo n Conferenc e of 1871 (see Note 104) on the political activit y of the workin g class and agains t the sectaria n sections .
Marx and Engels did a tremendou s amoun t of work in preparatio n for the congress .
The Genera l Counci l meetings , in which they took a most active part, discusse d and approve d proposal s to the congres s on the change s to be introduce d into the Rule s and Regulation s of the International , above all, the suggestio n that the Rule s should incorporat e the resolution s on politica l activity of the workin g class and on the extensio n of the power s vested in the Genera l Council .
The Hagu e Congres s was the most representativ e one in the history of the First Internationa l being attende d by 65 delegate s from 15 nationa l organisations .
It took stock of the many years Marx, Engel s and thei r follower s devote d to the struggle agains t all brands of petty-bourgeoi s sectarianis m in the working-clas s movement, abov e all Bakuninism .
The anarchis t leaders were expelle d from the International.
Th e decision s of the Hague Congres s laid the groundwor k for the establishmen t in variou s countrie s of independen t politica l parties of the working class .
p .
93 137 Engels' work "In the Case of Brentano Versus Marx " was an immediat e respons e to the publicatio n in the press of the pamphle t Meine Polemik mit Karl Marx by Lujo Brentano , a prominent representative o f armchai r socialism .
Simultaneousl y with the publication , the Deutsches Wochenblatt carried Brentano' s preface , and somewhat later , a note in which an attemp t was made to substantiat e Brentano' s stand by passage s from Gladstone' s letters to him regardin g the phrase from his speec h in the House of Common s on April 16, 1863 that Marx had supposedly misquoted .
Brentano's purpos e was to continu e the campaig n of slander against Marx, which h e had begun anonymousl y back in 1872 and which was later sup-ported b y the British economis t Sedley Taylor .
To foil the attempt s to cast aspersions o n Marx as a scholar and undermin e confidenc e in his doctrine , Engels decided t o give anothe r rebuff to Brentano and his follower s in the press, and at the same time to deal a blow to the armchai r socialists ' dogma s concerning a n alleged improvemen t in the conditio n of the workin g class.
Immediately followin g the appearanc e in the Deutsches Wochenblatt of the note containin g passage s from Gladstone' s letters to Brentano (see this volume , p.
175), Engels published i n Decembe r 1890 a reply in Die Neue Zeit (included as a supplemen t in Engels' pamphlet an d feature d on pp.
175-76 of this volume), t o be followe d by the entire work in April 1891.
Under th e headin g "Documents " Engels published al l material s relevan t to Marx's polemi c with Brentano and Eleano r Marx's with Taylor , as well as his own writing s on the subject .
The document s feature d in this section have been included i n the pertinen t volume s of the presen t edition .
In this volume , they are reproduce d again in conformit y with the plan and the arrangemen t of the material i n Engels' pamphlet.
Armchair socialism, a trend in bourgeoi s ideolog y in the 1870s-90s , whose advocates, notably , liberal professors , preache d bourgeoi s reformis m from university lectern s passin g it off as socialism .
The trend emerge d out of the fear engendere d in the exploitin g classes by the spread of Marxis t ideas and the growin g working-clas s movement , and was an attemp t by bourgeoi s ideologists t o find new ways of divertin g the workin g masses from the class struggle.
Prominen t armchai r socialists , includin g Adolph Wagner, Gustave Schmoller, Luj o Brentan o and Werne r Sombart , insisted that the state was an institution abov e classes , and one capabl e of reconcilin g the hostile classes and gradually introducin g "socialism " withou t violatin g the interest s of the capitalists.
Th e programm e of armchai r socialis m was merely to set up bodies that woul d insure worker s agains t illness and accidents , improv e factor y legislation etc .
Armchai r socialis m was one of the ideologica l source s of revisionism.

The congres s founde d the Social-Democrati c Workers ' Party of Austria and adopte d a programm e labelle d "Declaratio n of Principles " and base d on the main tenets of Marxism .
The Declaratio n named as its objectives th e politica l organisatio n of the proletaria t and the advancemen t of its class-consciousness , campaig n to turn the means of productio n into public property, emancipatio n of all workin g people from economi c dependence , the attainment o f politica l rights and enhancemen t of their cultura l level.

215 183 This work contain s critica l remark s about the new draft programm e of the Social-Democratic Part y of Germany .
By decisio n of the party congres s held in 1890 in Halle, it was to replace the Gotha programme (adopte d in 1875), which contained seriou s theoretica l errors .
This versio n of the draft, drawn up mainly by Augus t Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht , was not made public ; the new draft, carried by the Vorwärts on July 4, 1891, was worked out with due consideratio n to man y of Engels' remarks and suggestions , especiall y with regar d to its Preamble and the economi c demand s it contained .
The publicatio n was followe d by a discussio n in the course of which new drafts wer e proposed , notabl y by Die Neue Zeit editorial board .
This draft was draw n up by Karl Kautsky , substantiall y endorse d by Engels and publishe d in the said magazine .
It became the foundatio n of the final versio n worke d out by a commissio n heade d by Liebknecht.
The draft was submitte d to the party congress hel d in Erfurt on Octobe r 14-21 , 1891.
The programm e adopte d by the congres s was Marxis t in characte r and testified to the ideologica l victor y of Marxis m over other trend s of socialis m and ove r petty-bourgeoi s distortions .
"The last vestige s of Lassalleanis m have been removed, " wrote Engels to Friedrich Adolp h Sorge on Octobe r 24, 1891 (see presen t edition , Vol.
49).
The programm e scientificall y substantiate d the ultimat e goals and the short-term objective s set by the party (direc t legislation , self-governmen t by the people, the replacemen t of standin g armie s by an armed populace , freedo m of speech, association , meeting s and the press, equalit y for women , free educatio n and medica l care, etc.
, with all the points on the programm e based on a Marxist analysis) .
A separat e sectio n define d what had to be done to promot e the interest s of the workin g class (the 8-hour day, a ban on child labour , the introduction of factory inspectio n and a state-ru n syste m of social insurance , etc.
).
But the programm e was not withou t its faults.
It lacked some essentia l theoretical provision s and demands , includin g a definitio n of the ways and means for the proletaria t to take over politica l power , the establishmen t of a democratic republi c or, as Engels suggested wit h regar d to the politica l situation in Germany , "concentratio n of all politica l power in the hands of the people's representatives" , and a plan of work amon g the peasantry .
However , the significanc e of these drawback s becam e clear only much later.
By and large, the programm e was on a par with Marxis t theory and made a strong impac t on the new programme s of other socialis t parties .
At the time, Engels did not intend his work to be published .
It appeare d for the first time in 1901 in Die Neue Zeit.
The editoria l prefac e stated that Engels' manuscript ha d been found amon g Liebknecht' s papers .

With Social-Democrati c greetings , the Part y Executive " [Draft Programm e of the Social-Democrati c Party of German y [Paragraph I ] The separatio n of the workingma n from the means of labour—land, mines , pits, quarries , machiner y and tools, the means of communication, an d their transfe r into exclusiv e possessio n of part of the members o f society have split the society into two classes , the toiling and the propertied.
[Paragraph 2 ] Concentrate d in the hands of exclusiv e owners (monopolists) , the mean s of labour necessar y for the existenc e of society have turned into means o f exploitation .
The workers ' dependenc e on individua l owners of the means o f labour ensuin g from this is the foundatio n of slavery in all its forms, denial o f politica l rights, social misery , physica l degradatio n and menta l denigration.
[Paragraph 3 ] Under the dominatio n of the exclusiv e owners—capitalists , big landowners , the bourgeoisie—th e accumulatio n of the means of labour and of the wealth that has been create d by the exploite d increase s in the hands of the capitalist s with growin g speed, the distributio n of the produc t of labour becomes mor e and more uneven , the numbe r and the misery of the proletaria t increase continuously , the army of superfluou s labour assume s an increasingl y mass character , class antagonism s and the class struggl e are mounting , splittin g society int o two armed hostile camps and becomin g a characteristi c feature of all industriall y develope d countries .
[Paragraph 4 ] The planlessnes s rooted in the nature of capitalis t private production breed s increasingl y length y crises and unevennes s of production , which furthe r deteriorat e the conditio n of the workingmen , ruin broad strata of the population , give rise to universa l economi c and politica l instabilit y and plunge societ y at large into turbulenc e and confusion .
[Paragraph 5 ] To put an end to this state, which is growin g more intolerable da y by day, by removin g the causes , and to bring about the emancipation o f the workin g class—thi s is the goal and the task of Social Democracy.
Notes [Paragraph 6 ] The Social-Democrati c Party of German y therefor e strives to bring abou t the transformatio n of the means of labour—land , mines, pits, quarries, machinery , and tools, the means of communication—int o commo n property, an d capitalis t private production , into social socialis t production , a transformation fo r which capitalis t society itself create s the materia l and spiritual conditions .
[Paragraph 7 ] The emancipatio n of the workin g class can be the work only of the workin g class itself, for all the other classes and parties base themselve s on capitalis m and, despite their conflictin g interests , have a commo n goal, to preserve an d consolidat e capitalism .
[Paragraph 8 ] Realisin g that the emancipatio n of the workin g class is not a national bu t a social task in which the worker s of all civilise d countrie s are equally involve d and which can be resolve d only throug h internationa l co-operation, th e Social-Democrati c Party of German y feels and declare s itself to be at one wit h the class-consciou s worker s in all other countries .
[Paragraph 9 ] The Social-Democrati c Party had nothin g in commo n with so-called stat e socialism : a system of fiscal nationalisatio n which places the state in place of the private entrepreneu r and impose s the double yoke of economi c exploitation an d politica l oppressio n upon the worker .
[Paragraph 10 ] The Social-Democrati c Party is fightin g not for new class privileges an d prerogatives , but for the abolitio n of class dominatio n and for equal right s for all, withou t discriminatio n on the basis of sex or origin.
In its struggle fo r the emancipatio n of the workin g class, the struggl e for the emancipation o f mankind , Social Democrac y fights for all demands , measure s and arrangement s which are capabl e of improvin g the positio n of the people in general an d the workin g class in particular .

Prussia retaine d the upper chambe r consistin g mainly of the feuda l nobility ; the power s of the Landta g were severel y curtaile d and it was deprive d of the right to initiate legislation .
Minister s were to be appointe d by the king and made accountabl e to him alone.
The constitutio n grante d the government th e right to set up special courts to deal with cases of high treason .

Notes The so-calle d constitutional conflict aros e in the early 1860s betwee n the Prussian governmen t and the bourgeois-libera l majorit y in the Landtag .
In February 1860 , the majorit y refuse d to approv e a plan for reorganisin g the army submitte d by War Ministe r von Roon.
However , the governmen t soon managed t o secure allocation s for "maintenanc e of the army's combat readines s and enhancemen t of its firepower" , which meant , to all intents and purposes , that the reorganisatio n could proceed .
When in March 1862 the libera l majority refuse d to approv e the militar y budge t and demande d that the war ministry b e made accountabl e to the Landtag , the governmen t dissolve d the latter an d called new elections .
In late Septembe r 1862 an administratio n was formed unde r Bismarck , which again dissolve d the Landta g that Octobe r and embarked o n the militar y reform withou t it approvin g the necessar y funds.
The conflic t was not resolve d until 1866, when, followin g the Prussia n victory over Austria , the Prussia n bourgeoisi e capitulate d before Bismarck .
The Constitution of the German Empire promulgate d on April 16, 1871 was based on the constitutio n of the North Germa n Confederatio n approve d on April 17 , 1867, with the change s introduce d into it in Novembe r 1870 by the treaties o n the entry of South Germa n states (Baden , Hesse, Bavari a and Württemberg) into the Confederation .
The Constitutio n of 1871 consolidate d Prussian supremac y in German y and the reactionar y foundation s of the German Empire' s state structure .
The Reichstag' s legislativ e power s were substantially curtailed , and the laws passed by it made subject to approva l by the Federa l Counci l and the Emperor .
The prerogative s of the latter, and of the Chancellor , who enjoye d independenc e from the Reichstag , were very broad.
Th e constitutio n perpetuate d the vestige s of particularis m and the privileges o f some small Germa n states.

230 95 This essay is an extract from Engels' letter to Lafargu e of 2 Septembe r 1891 (for the full text of the letter see presen t edition , Vol.
49).
This essay was publishe d in Le Socialiste, in a slightly abridge d form and with editoria l changes .
Its Germa n translation appeare d in the Vorwärts, No.
216, Septembe r 16, 1891 in the "Politische Übersicht " column.
I n a letter to Bebel of Octobe r 1, 1891, Engels voiced hi s displeasur e at the quality of the Germa n translation .
The Second International Socialist Workers' Congress too k place in Brussel s on August 16-22 , 1891.
It was precede d by bitter struggl e betwee n the Marxist s and the opportunists , with the latter attemptin g to take over preparation s for the congres s (see Note 109).
Thank s to the Marxists ' and Engels' personal efforts, th e attemp t failed.
The congress , at which over 350 delegate s from European countrie s and the USA were present , was mostly Marxist .
The majority resolve d agains t admittin g the anarchists .
Also taking part in its work were representative s of the British trade unions .
Among th e points on the agenda were the labour law, the strike and the boycott, an d the attitud e to militarism .
Of the decision s reache d by the congress , Engels commented i n his essay on the resolutio n on labour law (borrowin g phrase s from the introductio n to, and the conclusio n of, the resolution) , and the resolutio n on the strike and the boycott.
Th e former urged the worker s of the world to pool their efforts in the struggle agains t the rule of capitalis m and to use their politica l rights (whereve r they existed ) to emancipat e themselve s from wage slavery .
In the resolutio n on the strik e and the boycott , the congres s recommende d the worker s to emplo y these mean s of struggle .
It emphasise d the absolut e necessit y of trades associations fo r the workin g people .
The key issue at the congres s was the attitud e of the workin g class to militarism.
Wilhelm Liebknecht' s and Edouard Vaillant' s reports o n the subject , as well as the resolutio n submitte d by Liebknecht, stated tha t militaris m was an inevitable produc t of the capitalis t system , that only the establishmen t of a socialist societ y could put an end to it and secure peace among nations , and that the socialist s were the real party of peace.
However , the resolutio n did not 40* Notes say what could be done to remove the threat of war in practica l terms.
It ended with an appeal to the worker s of all countrie s to launch vigorou s protest actions against wa r preparation s and militar y alliances , and to do their best to bring the triumph o f socialis m neare r by strengthenin g the internationa l organisatio n of the proletariat .
Liebknecht's resolutio n was oppose d by the Dutch delegat e Ferdinan d Domela Nieuwenhuys , who incline d toward s anarchism .
The resolutio n he submitted, callin g on the socialist s of all countrie s to exhort their people s to stage a general strike in the event of war, was defeate d by the congress .
The delegate s adopte d the resolutio n propose d by Liebknecht.
Engel s described th e outcom e of the congres s as a tactical and theoretica l victory for Marxism.

As a consequenc e of the government' s protectionis t policies , the prices of manufactured good s in Russia were significantl y highe r than those on the world market .
Considerin g the country' s backwardnes s as compare d to the more advance d capitalis t states, this policy was of great assistanc e to Russia' s industrial advance , but also a major burden on the populace ; it also narrowe d down th e home marke t and held up technologica l progress .

The programm e and organisationa l principle s of the Communis t League were drawn u p with the direct participatio n of Marx and Engels.
I n 1848-49, th e League's member s took an active part in the bourgeois-democrati c revolution s in Europe .
In 1849-50 , after the defeat of the revolution , the Communis t League wa s reorganised .

Owing to police persecutio n and the arrest of League member s in May 1851, the activitie s of the Communis t League as an organisatio n practicall y ceased in Germany .
On Novembe r 17, 1852, on a motion b y Marx, the Londo n Distric t announce d the dissolutio n of the League .

When publishin g the Introduction , the Executiv e of the Social-Democrati c Party of German y urgentl y requeste d Engels to tone down the excessivel y revolutionary (o r so they believed ) tenor of the work by couchin g his ideas in more cautiou s terms due to the Reichstag' s debate of the bill on "preventin g a coup d'état " submitted b y the governmen t in Decembe r 1894 and discusse d throughout January-Apri l 1895.
In a letter to Richar d Fische r of March 8, 1895, Engels criticised th e irresolute stan d by the Party leadershi p and their attempt s to act strictly within the bound s of legality .
However , forced to reckon with the opinio n of the Executive, h e agreed to omit a number of passage s and modify some of the definitions (se e presen t edition , Vol.

The galley proofs where these changes wer e made and the manuscrip t of the Introductio n allow us to completely reconstruc t the origina l text.
In the presen t edition , the deletion s and the change s are pointe d out in the footnotes .
Some Social-Democrati c leaders used this work to try and presen t Engels a s a supporte r of a strictly peacefu l transfe r of power to the workin g class.

Profoundl y indignant , Engels lodged a resolute protes t against the distortio n of his views, addressin g it to Wilhelm Liebknecht , editor of the Vorwärts (see presen t edition , Vol.

In a letter to Karl Kautsk y of April 1, 1895 Engels emphasised tha t with the publication o f the Introductio n in Die Neue Zeit "this disgracefu l impressio n may be erased " (see presen t edition , Vol.

However , both in the separat e edition of Marx's wor k and in Die Neue Zeit (Nos 27 and 28, 1895), the Introductio n appeared wit h the same omissions .
