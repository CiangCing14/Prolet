119) ORDER OF THE DAY, NO.
5, FEBRUARY 23, 1945 Comrades, Red Army men and Red Navy men, sergeants, officers and generals! Today we are celebrating the 27th Anniversary of the Red Army's existence.
Created by the great Lenin to defend.
our Motherland from the attack of foreign invaders, and reared by the Bolshevik Party, the Red Army has traversed a glorious path in its development.
It has fulfilled with credit its historic destiny · and is rightfully the beloved child of the Soviet people.
In the years of the civil war the Red Ar-my defended the young Soviet _State from numer-ous enemies.
In the· grea_t battles of the Patriotic War against German invasion the Red Army has saved the peoples of the Soviet Union from Ger-man-fascist slavery, upheld the freedom and in-dependence of our .
Motherland,.
and helped the peoples of Europe to cast off the German yoke.
Now we are celebrating the 27th Annivers-ary of the Red Army in the midst of .
fresh .
his-toric victories over the enemy.
The Red Army has not· only freed its native land of the Hitler-i te filth,but also hurled the enemy for many hun-· dreds of kilometres back beyond those lines from which the Germans launched their bandit attack upon our country, carried the war into Germany's territory and now, together with the armies of our Allies, is successfully completing the rout of the German-fascist army.
In .
I anuary of this year, the Red <\rrny hr-ought down upon the enemy a blow of unparall-eled force along the entfre front from the l3altic to the Carpathians.
On a stretch of 1,200 kilo-metres (750 miles).
i l broke up the powerful de-fences of the Germans which they had been buil-ding for a number.
of years.
In the course of the offensive the Red ,i\rmy by its sWift and skilful act ions, has hurl eel l he enemy far back to.
the West.
In stiff fighting the Soviet troops have ad-vanced from 't IH' frontiers of E;_1st Prussia to the lower reaches of the Vistulci -270 kilometres (175 miles), from tile Vistula bridg<'IH~ild south of War-saw lo the lower re<1chcs of the Oeler -570 kilo-metres (355 m iles),and from the Sandomir bridge-head into the depth of German Silesia -480 kilo-mct res (3.
miles).
The first consequence.
of the successes of our winter offensive was that they thwarted the Germans' winter offensive in the west,which aim-ed at the seizure of Belgium and Alsace, and en-abled the armies of our Allies in their· turn to launch an offensive against the Germans anq thus link up their offensive operations in the west with the offensive operations of the Red Army in the east.
In fnrty days of the offensive in .
I anuary-F ebruary, 1945, our troops have ejected the Ger-m ans from 300 towns, captured about l 00 war plants, manufacturing tanks, aircraft, armaments and ammunition, occupied over 2,400 railway sta-tions a111l seized a network of railways totalling over 15,000 kilometres (9,375 miles) in length.
Within this short period Germany has lost over 350,000 officers and men in prisoners of war and not less than 800,000 in killed.
During the same period the Red Army ha6 destroyed or seized a-bout 3,000 German aircraft, over 4,500 tanks and self-propelled guns and not less than 12,000 guns.
As a result, the Red Army has completely liberated Poland and a considerable part of the territory of Czechosl'ovakia, occupied Budapest and put our of the war Germany's last ally \n Europe, Hungary, captured the greater part of East Prussia and German Silesia and ·battled its way into Brandenburg, into Pomerania, to the ap-.
proaches to Berlin.
The Hitlerites boasted that for more than a hundred years not ·a single enemy soldier had been within Germany's borders,and that the Ger-man army had fought and would fight only on foreign soil.
Now an end has been put to this German bragging.
Our winter offensive has .
shown that the Red Army finds more and more strength for the solution of ever more complex and difficult prob-lems.
Its gJorious soldiers have learned to batter and annihilate the enemy in accordance with all the rules of modern military· science.
Our soldiers, .
inspired by the realization of their great mission of liberation,display .
miracles of heroism and self-lessness, and ably combine gallantry and audacity in battle with full utilization of the power and strength of their weapons.
The Red Army gen-erals and officers in masterly manner combine massed blows of powerful equipment with skilfuland swift manoeuvre.
Jn thr fourth year of the war, the Red Army hss grown stronger and .
mi-ghtier than ever before, its combat equipment has become still more perfect and its fighting mastery many times higher.
Comrades, ·Red Army men and Red Navy men, sergeants, officers and generals! Complete victory over the Germans is.
now already ne~r.
But victory never comes of itself -it is won in hard battles ;ind in persistent la-bour.
Thf' doomed Pnemv hurls his last forces in-to action, resists <ksperatclv in order to escape stern retribution.
I IP grnsps ;rnd will grasp at the most extreme and base mc;u1s of struggle.
There-fore it should be borne in mind that the nearer our victory, the higher must be our· vigilance and the heavier must be our blows at the enemy.
On behalf of the Soviet Government and our glorious Bolshevik Party, I greet and congrat-ulate you upon the 27th Anniversary of the Red Army! · To mark the great victories achif>ved by the armed forces of the Soviet State in the co-urse of the past year, I order: ' Today, February 23, on the day of the 27th Annm~rsary of the Red Army,at 20.
00 hours(Mos-cow time) a salute of 20 artillery salvoes shall be fired in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Pet-rozavodsk, Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius,.
Kishinev,Tbilisi, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, Odessa and Lvov.
Long live our glorious Red Army! Long live our victorious Navy! Long live our mighty Soviet Motherland! Eternal glory to the heroes who fell in the struggle for the freedom and independence of our r"\1otherland! Death to the German invaders! J.

11 11 Mr.
President,Mr.
Prime Minister, Gentlemen! I believe that the Treaty of friendship, Mu-tual Assistance and Post-War Collaboration be-tween the ·Soviet Union and Poland, which ·we have just signed is of great historic importance.
The importance of this Treaty consists in .
the first place in that it signifies the radical tu-rn of relations between the Soviet Union and Po-l:tnd towards alliance and friendship, a turn which took shape in the course 'of the present liberat-ion struggle against Germany and which is now being formally consummated in this Treaty.
It is known that relations between our co-untries in the course of the past five centuries have abounded in elements of mutual estrange-ment, unfriendliness, and not infrequently in open military conflicts.
Such relations weakened both our countries al'ld strengthened German imperial-ism.
The importance of the present Treaty con-sists in that it puts an end to these old relations between our countries, nails down the lid of the coffin over them, and creates a real basis for replacement of the old unfriendly relations by relations of alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and Poland.
rn the course of the Inst two World Wars the Germans succeeded in making use of the ter-ritory of Poland as a corridor for invasion of the East and as a springboard for attack on the Soviet Union.
,,.
This ·became possible because at .
that time there· were no friendly allied relations between our countries.
The former rulers of Po-land 1 did not want to have relations of· alliance with.
the Sovieti Union.
They preferred a policy of playing about between Germany and the So-viet Union.
And of course they played them-selves into trouble ••• Poland was occupied, her in-dependence abolished, and as a result of this whole ruinous policy German troops were en-abled to appear at the gates of Moscow.
The importance of the present Treaty con-sists in that it puts an encl to the old and ruin-ous policy of playing about bNween Germany and the Soviet Union, and repluces it by a policy of ,ti Iiance and friendship between Poland and· her I:;1st em neighbour .
.
Such is the historic importance of the Jn·aty between Poland aryd the Soviet Union on 1· riendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War Col-\;:1horation which we have just signed.
No wonder, therefore, that the peoples of our countries impatiently await the signing of this Treaty.
They feel that this Treaty is a pledge· of the independence of new, democratic Poland, ;1 pledge of her might and her prosperity.
I3ut matters are not confined to that.
The present Treaty has als.
b great international sig-nificance.
As long as there existed no alliancy between our countries Germany was able to take advantage· of the absence of a united fron~ be-t ween us, she could oppose Poland to the Soviet Union and· vice versa, and thus beat them one at a time.
Things changed radically after the all-· iance between our countries took shape.
Now it is no longer possible to oppose our countries to each other.
Now there exists a united front be-t ween our countries from the Baltic to the Car-pathians against the common enemy, against Ger-man inperialism.
Now one may confidently say that German aggression i~ besieged from the Ea-st.
Undoubtedly if this barrier in the East is sup-plemented by a barrier in the West, that is, by alliance between our countries and our Allies in the West, one may safely say that German ag-gression will be curbed, and that it will not be easy for it to run loose.
No wonder, therefore, that the freedom-lov-ing nations, ancl in the fir~;t rl:ice the SJ;iv na-tions, impntif'nt Iv aw;1it t lw concl11sirn1 of this Treaty, for thPy spe th<1t this Tn·;1tv signif'i('S a strenr:;thl'ning of 1he unitf'rl front of the United Nation· ' ,:iinst th1• common Pncmy in [urop('.
I iwrcfore, ·I do not rlnuht that our /\!lies in the West will welcome tl1is Treaty.
May free, independent, democratic Poland live and prosper! May her Eastern neighbour -our Soviet Un-ion -live nncl prosper! Long live t lw allinncc und friendship betwe-en our countri<'s! ( "::,t;ll in' s \JJar Srv «-cchr:s, Ptc.

I address you, commanders and men of the Red Army, and of the armies of our Allies.
, The victorious armies of the Allied Powers, wtlging a war of liberation in Europe, have rout-f'd the German troops and linked up on the ter-ritory of Germany.

will fulfil to the end this task and this duty to our people, and to all freedom-loving peoples.
I greet the valorous troops of our Allies, which are now standing on the territory of Ger-many shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet troops and which are full of determination to carry out their duty to the end.

STALIN ("Pravda," 24 May, 1945) ORDER Of THE DAY, NO.
20, Of MAY l; 1945 Comrades, Red Army men and Red Navy men, sergeants and petty officers, officers of the Army and Navy, generals and admirals! Working people of the Soviet Union! Today our country is celebrating the l st of May -the international festival of the work-ing people.
This year, the peoples of our Motherland :ire celebrating May Day under conditions of the victorious termination of the Great PatrioticI The hard times when the Red Army fought hack the enemy troops at ·Moscow and Leningrad, at Grozny and Stalingrad, are gone -never to return.
Now our victorious troops are battering the enemy's armed forces in the centre of Ger-many, far beyond Berlin, on the River Elbe.
Within a short time Poland, Hungary, the greater part of Czechoslovakia, a considerable part of Austria, and her capital Vienna,have been liberated.
At the same time the Red Army has captured East Prussia, hoine of German imperial-ism, Pomerania, the greater part of Brandenburg <rnu the main districts of Germany's capital· Ber-lin, having hoisted the banner of victory over Berlin.
As a result of these offensive battles fo-ught by the Red Army, within 3 to 4 months the C<~rmans have lost over 800,000 officers and men i 11 prisoners and about 1 -mill ion in killed.
During the same period the Red Army troops have cap-t urecl or de·sptroyed up to 6,000 enemy aircraft, up to 12,000 tanks and self-propelled guns, over 23,000 field guns and enormous quantities of oth-er armaments and equipment.
It should be noted that in these battles Po-1ish, Yugoslav, Czechoslovak, Bulgarian and Ru-manian divisions successfully advanced against the common enemy side by side with the Red Army.
.
As a result of the Red Army's shattering blows, the German Comm;rnd was compelled to transfer dozens of divisions to the Soviet-German Front, baring whole sectors on other fronts.
This circumstance helped the forcPs of our Allies to develop their successful offensive in the West.
Thus by simultaneous blows ;H the German troops from East and West, the troops of ~he Allies and the Red Army were able to cut the German for-ces into two isolated parts and to effect a jun-ction of our troops and the Allied troops in a united front.
There can be no doubt that this circums-tance means the end of Hitlerite Germany.
The days of Hitlerite Germany are number-ed.
More than half her territory is occupied by the Red Army and by the troops.
of our Allies.
Germany has lost the most.
important, vital dis-tricts.
The industry remaining in the Hitlerites' hands cannot supply the German army with suf-ficient quantities of armaments, ammunition and fuel.
The man-power reserves of the German ar-my are depleted.
Germany is completely isolated and stands alone, if her ally Japan is not counted.
In search of a way out from their hopeless plight,the Hitlerite adventurers resort to all kinds of tricks, down to flirting with the Allies, in an effort to cause dissension in the Allied camp.
These fresh knavish tricks of the Hitlerites are doomed to utter failure.
They can only acceler-ate the disintegration of the German troops.
Mendacious fascist propaganda intimidates the German population by absurd tales, alleging 1 hat the Armies of the United Nations wish to ,·xterminate the German people.
The United Na-t ions do not set themselves the task of.
destroy-i11g the German people.
The United Nations will destroy fascism and German militarism, will se-wrely punish war criminals, and will compel the ( ;ermHns to compensate damage they have caused to other countries.
But the United Nations do not molest and will not molest Germany's civilian population if it honestly fulfils the demand·s of the Allied military authorities.
The brilliant victories won by the Soviet troops in the Great Patriotic War have demon-strated the colossal might of the Red Army and its high military skill.
In the progress of the war our Motherland has come to possess a fi.
rst-rate regular army, capable of upholding the great So-ci<ilist achievements of our people and of secur-ing the State interests of the Soviet Union.
Despite the fact that the Soviet Union has for nearly four years b.
een waging war on an un-paralleled scale demanding colossal expenditures, our Socialist economic system is gaining sti-rength and developing, while the economy of ~he Ii berated regions, plundered and ruined by the German ·invaders, is successfully and swiftly re-viving.
This is the result of the heroic efforts of the workers and collective farmers, of the So-viet intellectuals, of the women and the youth qf our country, inspired and guided by the great l~olshevik Party.
The world war unleashed by the German imperialists is drawing to a close.
The collapseof Hitlerite Germany is a matter of the nearest future.
The Hitlerite ringleaders, who imagined themselves rulers of the world, have found them-selves ruined.
The mortally wounded fascist beast is breathing its last.
One thing is now required -to deal the death-blow to the fascist beast.
fighting men of the Red Army and Navy! The last sto"rming of the Hitlerite lair is on.
Set new examples of military skill and gal-lantry in the concluding battles.
Smite the enemy harder, skilfully break up his defence, pursue and surround the German invaders, give them no re-spite until they cease resistance.
Beyond the border of.
our native land be especially vigilant! · Uphold the honour and dignity of the Soviet soldier as heretofore! Work Ing f)f'opl<' of t lw Sovie'! · l111lo11! Increase your all-round assistance to the front by persistent and indefatigable work.
Swift-ly heal the wounds inflicted on our country by the war, raise still higher the might of· our So-viet State!

(flb-'>cow time) on flay 9, 1945.
Comrades! Men and women c~mpatriots! The great day of victory over Germany has come.
Fascist Germany, forced to her knees by the Red Army and the troops of our Allies,has acknowledged herself defeated and declared un-conditional surrender.
On May 7, the preliminary protocol on sur-render was signed in the city of Rheims.
On May 8, representatives of the German High Command, in the presence of representatives of the Su-preme Command of the Allied Troops and the Supreme Command of the Soviet Troops, signed in Berlin the final act of surrender,the execution of which began at 24.
00 hours on May 8.
P, "1i; awarP of the wolfish habits of the German ringleaders, who regard treaties and ag-reements as empty scraps of paper, we have no reason to trust their words.
However,this morning, in pursuance of the act of surrender, the German troops began to lay down.
their arms and surrend-er to our troops en masse.
This is no longer an empty scrap of paper.
This is actual surrender of Germany's armed forces.
True, one group of German troops in the area of Czechoslovakia is still evading surrender.
But I trust that the 'Red Army will be able to bring it to its senses.
.
Now we can state with full justification that the historic day of the final def eat of Ger-many, the day of the great victory of our people ·over German imperialism has come.
The great sacrifices we made in the name of the freedom and independence of our Mother-land, the incalculable privations and sufferings experienced by our people in the course of the war, the intense work in the rear and at the fr-ont, placed on the altar of the Motherland, have not been in vain, and have been crowned by complete victory over the enemy.
The age-long struggle of the Slav peoples for their existence and their independence has ended in victory o~er the German invaders and German tyranny.
Henceforth the great banner of the freedom of the peoples and peace among peoples will fly flvcr Europe.
Thre(' years ago Hitler declared for all to \11';11 thnt hls aims included the dismemberment ()I t lie Soviet Union und the wresting from it of t lw Caucasus, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the B~ ltic 1 l:111ds and other areas.
He declared bluntly: Wewill destroy Russia so that she will never be able to rise again.
" This was three years ago.
How-ever, Hitler's crazy ideas.
were not fated to come true -the progress of the war scattered them to the winds.
Jn actual fact the direct opposite of the Hitlerites' ravings has taken place.
Ger-many is utterly _defeated.
The German troops are surrendering.
The Soviet Union is celebrating Victory, although ·it does not intend either to dismember or to destroy Germany.
Comrades!The Great Patriotic War has end-ed in our complete victory.
The period of war in Europe is over.
The period of peaceful devel-opment has begun.
I congratulate you upon victory,· my dear men and women compatriots! Glory to our heroic Red Army which upheld the independence of our Motherland and won vic-tory over the enemy! Glory to our people, the people victorious! Eternal glory to the heroes who fell in the struggle against the enemy and gave their lives for the freedom and happiness of our peoph~!

· The foreign Press has printed a report that · several Poles who, according to t he recent "T.
ass" statement had been arrested on the charge of ' .
.
the organization and· carrying out of di.
vers1on!st actions in the rear of the Red Army, m reality were members of a delegation invited to condu<:;t negotiations· with the Soviet authorities.
It has also been reported that this group of Poles in-cludes democratic leaders whose opinion on the formation of the future Polish Government would have made a valuable contribution to the forma-t ion of such a Government.
It has also been re-ported that by the arrest of these Poles.
the So-viet Government undermines confidence in the measures adopted in the Crimea, and hinders theformation of a new Polish Provisional Govern-ment.
Would you care to make a statement on this question in order to clarify public opinion, which is interested in this question? Moscow,May l l, 1945.

Pawl'l: I have somewhat delaye·d.
my answer, but this is understandable if one keeps in ·mind how busy I am.
1.
The arrest of the sjxteen Poles in Poland headed by the well-known diversionist General Okulicki has no connection with the q~~stion of the reconstruction of the.
.
,_Polish Pro-v1s1onal Government.
These "gentlemen" were ar-rested in.
accordance with t]le law protecting the Red Army rear from diversionists -a law similar to the British Defence of the Realm Act'.
The arrests were carried out by Soviet military auth-orities in accordance with an agreement conclud-ed between the Polish ProvL:;ional Government and the Soviet Military Command.
2.
It is untrue that the arrested Poles were invited for negotiations with the Soviet author-ities.
The Soviet authorities do not and will not conduct negotiations with those who break the law 9n the protection of the Red Army rear.

As far as the question of the reorgan-at ion of the Polish Provisional Government it-.
~el f is concerned, it can only be solved on the basis of the Crimea decisions, because no de-viation from these decisions can be permitted.

I think the Polish question can be solved by agreement between the Allies only if the fol-lowing elementary conditions are observed: a) If in the reconstruction of the Polish Provisional Government the latter is recognized as the basic core of the future Polish Govern-ment ot' National Unity, similar to the case of Yugoslavia, where the National Liberation Com-mittee was recognized as the basic core of the United Yugoslav Governme11t; b) If as a result of the reconstruction a Government is created ih Poland which will pur-sue a policy of friendship with the Soviet Union, and not the policy of the "cordon sanitaire"again-st the Soviet Union; c) If the question of the· reconstruction of the Polish Government is resolved together with the Poles who now have ties with the Polish people, and not without them.

137)TOAST TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AT A RE-CEPTION IN HONOUR OF THE RED ARMY CO-MMANDERS GIVEN BY ·THE SOVIET GOVERN-MENT IN THE KREMLIN Comrades! Permit me to propose one more, 10st toast.

(Loud and prolonged applause ond shouts of "Hurrah.
") I drink in the first place to the health of the Russian people because it is the most out-standing nation of all the nations forming the Soviet Union.
I propose a toast to the health of the Russian people because it has won in this war universal recognition as the leading force of the Soviet Union among all the peoples of our country.
I propose a toast to the health of, the Russian people not only because it is the leading people, but also because it possesses a clear mind, a staunch character and patience.
Our Government made not a few errors we experienced at moments a desperate situation ' in 1941-1942, when our Army was retreating,ab-andoning our own villages and towns of the Uk-raine, Bye'lorussia, Moldavia, the Leningrad region, the Baltic area and the Karelo-Finnish Republic, abandoning them because there was no other way out.
A different people could have said to the Government "You.
have failed to justify our ex-pectations.
Go away.
We shall install another Gov-ernment which will conclude peace with Germany and assure us a quiet life.
" The Russian people, however, did not take this path because it trust-f'd the correctness of the policy of its Govern-ment, and it made sacrifices to ensure the rout of Germany.
This confidence of the Russian people in the Soviet Government proved to be that decisive force which ensured the historic victory over the enemy of humanity -over fas-cism.
Thanks to it, the Russian people, for this confidence! To the health of.
the Russian people! (Loud and prolonged applause.

Do not imagine that· I am going to tell you anything extraordinary.

I would like to drink to the health of those on the lower echelons whose conditions are little envied, to those who are considered as the "screws" of the immense machine of the government but without whom, all of us marshals or commanding officers of the fronts or armies wouldn't be worth, if I may so express it, a jot.
Because it requires only for one screw to disappear and all is finished.
I drink to the health of simple folk, ordinary aIJd modest, the "screws" which ensure the function-ing of our.
enormous state machine in all its as~ pects: science, economy, war.
They are numerous and their name is legiqn because they comprise dozens of millions.
These are modest people, no-one writes about them, their situation is mediocre and their status is low, but these people support us as the base supports the summit.

· It is well known that the strategy of the Germans on land and at sea went hopelessly wrong.
The Red Army, together with our Allies · routed the Hitlerites and forced them to" capit~ ulate.
In both the defensive and offensive fighting of our Red Army, our Navy was a dependable cover for the flanks of our Red Army pushing through to the sea,blocking the enemy's merchant shipping and strategically important navigation route~, securing the uninterrupted functioning of our Imes of communication.
The fighting action of the Soviet Navy is illustrated through its self-sacrificing steadfastness and valour, its intense combat activity and military skill.
The submarine men, the sailors, the naval airmen, artillerymen and infantry have taken over and further devel-oped everything that was so valuable in the hun-60 dreds of years of tradition of the Russian Navy.
The Soviet .
sailors have in the four years <lf war, on the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the l~ments Sea, on the Volga, the Danube and the Dnieper, added new pages to the glorious history of the Russian Navy.
The Navy has more than1 fulfilled its duty to the Soviet Motherland.
Comrades sailors, commanders and officers! The Soviet people want to see their Navy even stronger and more powerful.
Our people will produce more warships and bases for the Navy.
The task of the Navy is to educate inexperienced marine cadres, to perfect them, to help them .

2, 1945.
Comrades! fell ow countrymen and country-women! Today, September 2, political and military representatives of Japan signed an act of uncon-ditional surrender.
Utterly defeated on sea and land, and completely surrounded by the a_rmed forces of the United Nations, Japan has admitted defeat and has laid down liier arms.
Two hotbeds of world fascism and world aggression had been formed on the eve of the present World War: Germany in the West and J a-pan in the East.
It was they who unleashed the Second World War.
It was they who brought man-kind and civilization to the brink of doom.
The hotbed of world aggression in the West was de-stroyed four months ago and, as a result, Ger-many was forced to capitulate.
Four months lntN the hothf'd of Hggr<'ssion in the East was des trove cl anc I ;1s ;1 re.
st1 It, Jap8 n, Germ.
any' s principal <1llv.
w;1s ;ilso compelled to sign an act of c;1pitui:lt i1i'11.
This .
sig1:i fi<'c; the ('IHI of the Second WqrJcl Now we <'<lll ';;iv th:it tlH· conditions nfx:es-sr1n· for pPnn' ;ill ov<'r the world have been gained.
It must be observed that the Japanese ag-gressors inflicted damage not only on our Allies -China, the U.
S.
A.
and Great Britain.
They also inflicted extremely grave damage on our country.
That is why we have a seperate account to settle with Japan.
Japan commenced her aggression ngainst our country as far back as 1904,during the· Russo -.
I apanese War.
As we know, in February 1904, when negotiations between Japan and Russia were .
still proceeding, Japan, taking advantage of the weakness of· the tsarist government, suddenly and perfidiously, without declaring war, fell upon our country and attacked the Russ'ian fleet 'in the region of Port Arthur with the object of putting a number of Russian warships out of action and thereby creating an advantageous position for her fleet.
She did, indeed, put out of action three Russian first-class warships.
It is characteristic that 37 years later Japan played exactly the same perfidious trick against the United States when, in 1941, she attacked the United States rwval hase in Pearl Harbour and put a number of American battleships out of action.
As we know, in the war against Japan, Russia was de-feated.
Japan took.
advantage of the defeat of tsarist Russia to seize f.
rom Russia the southern part of Sakhalin and establish herself on the Ku-ri l Islands, thereby putting the lock on all· our country's out lets to the ocean in the East, which meant also all outlets to the ports of Soviet Ka-mchatka and Soviet Chukotka.
It was obvious that Japan was aiming to deprive Russia of the whole of her Far East.
But this does not exhaust the list of J a-pan's aggressive operations against our country.
·In 1918, after the Soviet system was established in our country, Japan, taking advantage of the hostility then displayed towards the Land of the Soviets by Great Britain, France and the United States, and leaning upon them, again attacked our country, occupied the Far East and for four years tormented our people and looted the Soviet Far East.
· Nor is this all.
In 1938 Japan attacked our country again, in the region of Lake Hasan, near Vl;1divostok, with the object of surrounding Vlad-ivostok; mid in the following year Japan repeated i1"r ;lttack in another place, in the region of the \lonr;olian People's Republic, near Khalkin-gol, wit 11 the obj<'ct of breaking into Soviet territory, ''<'VPring 01ir Siberian Rai I way and cutting off the 1.
-cir !~ast from Russia.
True, J ;1pan's attacks in the regions of Has-an and Khalkin-gol were liquidated by the Soviet troops, to the extreme humiliation of the Japan-ese.
Japanese military intervention in 1918-1922 was liquidated with equal success and Japanese invaders were expelled .
from our Far Eastern re-gions.
But tlir' clefeclt of the Russian troops in 190-l during t !if' l~usso-J 8p:Hwse W8r left bitter m('111orit's in tliv minds of (n11· people.
It lay like a black stuin 1in om count r\.
Our people believed in and waited for t lie cl:i:v· whf.
'n .
I :ipan would be clpfcatcd and tlw st;iin wn1ild he wiped out.
We of the older generation w:iitccl for this clay for forty yen rs, cind now this <by has arrived.
Today .
I a pan admitted defeat and signed ·an act of un-conditional surrender.
This means that the southern part of Sa-khalin and the Kuril Islands revert to the Soviet Union and henceforth will serve not as a barrier between the Soviet Union and the ocean and ·as a base for Japanese attack upon our Far East but as a direct means of communication between the Soviet Union and the ocean and a base for the defence of our country against Japanese ag-gression.
Our Soviet people spared neither strength nor labour for the sake of victory.
We experienced extremely hard years.
But now.
everyone of us can say: We have won.
Henceforth we can regard our country as being free from the menace of German invasion in the West and of Japan~se in-vasion in the East.
The long awaited peace for the peoples of all the world has come.
I congratulate you, my dear fellow country-men and country-women, on this great victory, on the successful termination of the war, and 68 on the ushering in of peace all over the world! Glory to the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States of America, China and Great Britain which achi~v~d victory over Japan! Glory to our Far.
Eastern troops and ~ur Pacific Fleet, which upheld the honour and d1g-ni ty of our country! Glory to our great people, the victorious people! .

STALIN ("On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, 11 Ger-man Edition) SPEECH AT AN ELECTION MEETING Sta.
Lin llecLion Di~iAict, ~ohcow 9 Te£Aua/1_y, 1946 Comrades! Eight years have passed since the last elections to the Supreme Soviet~ This has been a period replete with events of a decisive na-ture.
The first four years were years of intense labour on the part of the Soviet people in l:arry-ing out the third Five Year Plan.
The second four years covered the events of the war again-st the German and Japanese aggressors -the events of the second world war.
Undoubtedly, the war was the major event of the past period.
It would be wrong to think that the second world war broke out accidentally, or as a re-sult of blunders committed by certain states-men, although blunders certainly were commit-ted.
As a matter of fact, the war broke out as the inevitable result of the development of world economic and political forces on the basis of pr.
esent day monopoli~tic capitalism.
Marxists have more than once stated that the capitalist system of world economy contains the elements of universal crises and military conflicts, that, in view of this, the development of world capit-alism in our times does •not proceed smoothly and evenly, but through crises and war cat-astrophes.
The point is that the uneven develop-.
ment of capitalist countries usually leads, in the course of time, to a sharp disturbance of the ·equilibrium within the world system of capital-ism, and that group of capitalist countries which regards itself as being .
less securely provided with raw materials and markets usually attempts to change the situation and to redistribute "spheres of influence" in its own favour -by em-ploying armed force.
As a result of this, the capitalist world is split into t'.
wo hostile camps, and war breaks out between them.
Perhaps, war catastrophes could be avoided if it were possible periodically to redistribute raw materials and markets among the respective countries in conformity with their economic weight -by means of concerted and · peaceful decisions.
But this is impossible under the present capitalist conditions of world economic development.
Thus, as a result of the first crisis of the capitalist system of world economy, the first world war broke out; and as a result of the sec-ond crisis, the second world war broke out.
This does not mean, of course, that the second world war was · a copy of the first.
On the contrary, the second world war differed mat-erially in character from the first.
It must be borne in mind ·that before attacking the Allied countries the majpr fascist states -Germany, J a-pan and Italy -destroyed the last vestiges of bourgeois-democratic liberties at home and es-tablished there a cruel, terroristic regime, trampled upon the principle of sovereignty and free development of small countries, proclaimed as their own the policy of seizing foreign terri-tory and publicly stated that they were a1mmg· at world domination and the spreading of the fascist' regime all over the world; and by seizing Czechoslovakia and the central regions of _China, the Axis powers showed that they were ready to carry out their threat to enslave all the peace-loving peoples.
In view of this, the second world war against the Axis powers, unlike the first world war, assumed from the very outset the character of an anti-fascist war, a 'Var of liberation, one of the tasks of which was to re-store democratic liberties.
The entry of the Sov-iet Union into the war against the Axis powers could only augment -and really did augment -the anti-fascist and liberating character .
of the second world war.
It was on this basis that the anti-fascist con! it ion of the Soviet Union, the United States of America, GrPat Britain and other freedom-loving countriPs came into being and later play-ed the decisive role in def eating the armed for-ces of the Axis powers.
That is how .
it stands with the question of the origin and character of the second world war.
Everybody, probably, now admits that the war was not nor could have been an accident in the lives of the peoples, that it actually became a war of the peoples for their existence, and that for that very reason could not have been a swift or lightning war.
As far as our country is concerned, · for her this war was the fiercest and most arduous ·war in the history of our Motherland.
But the war was not only a curse.
It was als"o a great school kl which all the forces of the people were examined and tested.
The war laid bare · all facts and events in the rear and at the front, it ruthlessly tore down all the veils and coverings that concealed the actual features of states, governments and parties, and brought them onto the stage without masks and without make-up, with all their defects and mer-its.
The war was something in the nature of an examination of our Soviet system, of our State, of our government and of our Com muni~t Part~; and it summed up their work and said, as 1t were: Here they are, your people and organizat-ions, their life and work -scrutinize them care-fully and treat them according to their deserts.
This is one of the positive sides of the war.
for us, for the voters, this is of immense.
importance, for it helps us quickly a.
nd impartial-ly to appraise the activities of the Party and its men, and to draw.
correct conclusions'.
At another time we would have had to study the speeches and reports of the representatives of the Party, analyze them, compare their words with their deeds, sum up the results, and so forth.
This is a complicated and laborious job, and there is no guarantee against mistakes.
It is different now, when the war is over, when the war itself has verified the work of our or-ganizations and leaders and has summed it up.
It is now much easier to analyze matters, and arrive at correct conclusions.
And so, what are the results of the war? There is one principal result, upon which all the others rest.
This is, that at the end of the war the PnemiC'S sustnim~d ~1efeat arid we and our Allies proved to be the victors.
We terminated the war with complete victory over our enemies -this is the principal result of the war.
But this is too general, and we cannot put a full stop here.
Of course, to def eat the enem-ies in a war such as the second world war, the like of which has never been witnessed in the history of mankind before, means achieving a victory of world historical importance.
All this is true.
But still, it is a general result, and we cannot rest content with it.
To appreciate the great historical importance of our victory we must analyze the matter more concretely.
And so, how should our victory over the enemies be interpreted? What can this victory signify from the point of view of the state and the development· of the internal forces of· our country? Our victory signifi~s, first of all, that our Soviet social system was victorious, that the Soviet social system successfully passed the test of fire in the war and proved that it is fully viable.
As we know, the foreign press on more than one occasion asserted that the Soviet so-cial system was a "risky experiment" that was doomed to failure, that the Soviet system was a .
"house of cards" having no foundations in life ·and imposed upon the people by the Cheka, and that a slight shock from without was sufficient to· cause this "house 6f cards" to collapse.
Now we can say that the war has refuted all these · asserions of the foreign press and has proved them to have been groundless.
The war proved that ·the Soviet social system is a gen-ui nelv people's system, which ·grew up from the · ranks of the people and enjoys their powerful support; that the Soviet social system is a fully viable and stable form of organization of .
so-ciety.
More than that.
The issue now is not whether the Soviet social system is viable or not, because after the object lessons of the war, no sceptic now dares to express doubt con-cerning the viability of the Soviet social system.
Now the issue is that the Soviet social system has proved to be more viable and stable than the non-Soviet social system, that the Sovietsocial system is a better form of organization of society than any non-Soviet social system.
Secondly, our victory signifies that our Soviet state system was victorious, that our multi-national Soviet state passed all the tests of the war and proved its viability.
As we know, prominent foreign journalists have more than once expressed· themselves to the effect that the Soviet multi-national state is an "artificial and short-lived structure," that in the event of any complications arising, the collapse of the Soviet Union would be inevit-able, that the Soviet Union would share the fate of Austria-Hungary.
Now we can say that the war refuted these statements of the foreign press and proved them to have been devoi.
d of all _found-ation.
The war proved that the Soviet multi-national state system successfully passed the test, grew stronger than ever during the war, and turned out to be quite a viable state sys-tem.
These gentlemen failed to realise that the analogy of Austria-Hungary was unsoun9, be-·couse our multi-national state grew up not on the bourgeois basis, which stimulates sentiments of national distrust and national enmity, but on the Soviet basis, which, on the contrary, culti-vates sentiments of frirndship and fraternal cooperation among the peoples of our state.
Incidentally, after the lessons of the war, these gentlemen no longer dare to come out and deny the viability of the Soviet state system.
The issue now is no longer the viability of the Soviet state system, because there can be no doubt about its viability.
Now the issue is that the Soviet state system has proved to be a mod-el multi-national state, .
that the Soviet state system is such a system of state organization in which the national problem and the problem of the cooperation of nations have found a bet-ter solution than in any other multi-national state.
Thirdly, our victory signifies that the Sov-iet armed forces were victorious, that our Red Army was victorious, that the Red Army hero-ically withstood all the hardships of the war, ·utterly routed the armies of our enemies, and emerged from the war the victor.
(A voice: "Un-der Comrade Stalin's ·leadership!" All rise.
Loud and prolonged applause, rising to an ovation.
) Now,' everybody, friends and enemies ali~e, admit that the Red Army proved equal to its tremendous task.
But this was not the case six years ago, in the period befor'e the war.
As· we know, prominent foreign journalists, and many recognized authorities on military affairs abroad, repeatedly .
stated that the condition of the Red Army raised grave doubts, that the Red Army was poo.
rly armed and lacked a proper command-ing staff, that its morale was beneath criticism, that while it might be fit for defence, it was unfit for attack, and that, if struck by the Ger-man troops, the Red Army would collapse like "a colossus with feet of clay.
" Such statements were made not only in Germany, but also in France, Great Britain and America.
.
Now we can say that the war refuted all these statements and proved them to have been groundless and ridiculous.
The wur proved that the Red Army is not "a colossus with feet of clay," but a first-class modern army, equipped with the most.
up-to-date armaments, led by most experienced commanders and possessed of high morale and ·fighting qualities.
It must not be forgotten that the Red Army is the .
army which utterly .
routed the German army, the ar-my which only yesterday struck terror in the hearts of the armies of the European states.
It mu~t be noted that the "critics" of the Red Army are becoming fewer .
and fewer.
More.
than that.
Comments are more and more fre-quently appearing in the foreign press noting the high qualities of the Red Army, .
the skill of its men and commanders, and the flawlessness of its strategy and tactics.
This is understandable.
After the brilliant victories the Red Army achieved at Moscow and Stalingrad, at Kursk and Belgorod, at Kiev and Kirovograd, at Minsk and Bobruisk, at Leningrad and Tallinn, at Jassy and Lvov, on the Vistula and the Niemen, on the Danube and the Oder nnd at Vienna and Ber-lin -after all this, it is impossible not to admit that the Red Army is a first-class army, from which much can be learned.
(Loud applause.
) This is how we concretely understand the victory our country achieved over her enemies.
Such, in the main, are the results of the war.
It would be wrong to think that such an historical victory could have been achieved with-out the prelimi·nary preparation of the whole country for active defence.
It would be no less wrong to assume that.
such preparation could have been made in a short space of time, in a matter of three or four years.
It would be still more wrong to assert tltat our victory was en-tirely due to the bravery bf our troops.
Without bravery it is, of course, impossible to achieve victory.
But bravery alone is not enough to over-power an enemy who possesses a vast army, first-class armaments, well-trained officers and fairly well-organized supplies.
To withstand the blow of such an enemy, to resist him and then to inflict utter defeat upon him it was neces-sary to have, in addttion to the unexampled bra-very of our troops, fully up-to-date armaments, and in sufficient quantities, and well-organized supplies, also in sufficient quantities.
But for this it was necessary to have, and in sufficient quantities, elementary things· such as: metals -for the production of armaments, equipment and industrial machinery; fuel -to ensure the oper-ation of industry and transport; cotton "'.
' to manufacture army clothing; grain -·to supply the army with food.
Can it be maintained that before entering the second world war our country already pos-sessed the necessary .
minimum of the material potentialities needed to satisfy these main re-quirements? I think it can.
To prepare· for this immense task we had to carry out three Five Year Plans of national economic development.
It was precisely these three five.
Year Plans that enabled us to create these material potent-ialities.
At all events, the situation in our count-.
ry in this respect was ever so much better be-fore the second· world war, in 1940, than it was before the first world war, in 1913.
What were .
the material potentialities at our country's disposal before the second world war? To help you to understand this I shall have to make you a brief report on the activities of the Communist Party in the matter of preparing our country for active defence.
If we take the data for 1940 -the ~ve · of the second world war, and compare it· with the data for 1913 -the eve of the first world war, we shall get the following picture •.
In 1913 there was produced in our country 4,220,000 tons of pig iron, 4,230,000 tons of steel, 29,000,000 tons of coal, 9,000,000 tons of oil, 21,600,000 tons of marketable grain and 740,000 tons of raw ctton.
Such were the material potentialities of our country when she entered the first 'world war.
This was the economic basis old Russia could utilize for the purpose of prosecuting the war.
As regards 1940, in that year the following was produced in our country: 15,000,000 tons of pig iron, i.
e.
, nearly four times as ·much as in 1913; 18,300,000 tons of steel, i.
e.
, four and a half times as much as in 1913; 166,000,000 tons 80 of coal, i.
e.
, five and a half times as much as in 1913; 31,000,000 tons of oil, i.
e.
, three· and a half times as· much as in 1913; 38,300,000 tons of marketable grain, i.
e.
, 17,000,000 tons more than in 1913; 2,700,000 tons of raw cot-ton, i.
e.
, three and a half times as much as in 1913.
Such were the material potentialities of our country when she entered the second world war.
This was the economic basis the Soviet Union could utilize for the purpose of prosecut-ing the war.
The difference, as you see, is colossal.
This unprecedented growth of production cannot be regarded as the simple and ordinary development of a country from backwardness to progress.
lt was a leap by which our Motherland became transformed from a backward country into an advanced country, from an agrarian into an industrial country.
This historic ·transformation was brought about in the course of three five Year Plans, beginning with 1928 -with the first year of .
the first five Year Plan period.
Up to that time we had to · restore our ruined industries and heal the wounds inflicted upon us by the first world war and the Civil War.
If we take into consider-ation the fact that the first five Year Plan was carried out in four years, and that the execut-ion of the third five Year Plan was interrupted by war in the fourth year, it works out that the transformation of our country from an agrarianinto an industrial country took only about thirteen years.
It cannot but be.
admitted that thirteen years is an incredibly short period for the ex-ecution of such.
.
a gigantic task.
It is this that explains the storm of contro-v:rsy that br~ke <?Ut in the foreign press at the time these figures were published.
Our friends decided that a "miracle" had happened; those who were ill-disposed towards us proclaimed that the Five Year Plans were "Bolshevik propa-ganda" and "tricks of the Cheka.
" But as mir-acles do not happen and the Cheka is not so powerful as to.
be able to annul the laws of so-cial development, "public opinion" abroad was obliged to resign itself to the facts.
By what policy was the Communist Party able to create these material potentialities in so short a time? First of all by the Soviet policy of in-dustrializing the country.
· The Soviet .
method of industrializing the country differs radically from the capjtalist n:ieth~d of industrialization.
In capitalist count-ries, industrialization usually starts with light in-.
dust~y.
In vie~ of the fact that light industry ~equ1res less investments, that capital turnover is faster, and profits are made more easily than in heavy industry, light industry becomes the first object of industrialization in those count-ries.
Only after the passage of a long period of time, during which light industry accumulates profits and concentrates them in banks, only after this does the turn of heavy industry come and accumulations begin gradually to be trans-rerred to heavy .
industry for the purpose of creating conditions for its development.
But ·this is a long process, which ·takes a long time, run-ning into several decades, during which you have to wait while the light industry develops and do without heavy industry.
Naturally, the Commun-ist Party could not take this path.
The Party knew that war was approaching, that it would be impossible to defend our country without heavy industry, that it was necessary to set to work to develop heavy industry as ·quickly as ·possible, and that to be belated in this matter meant courting defeat.
The Party remembered what Lenin said about it being impossible to pro-tect the independence of our country without heavy industry, and about the likelihood of the Soviet system perishing without heavy industry.
The Communist Party of our country therefore rejected the.
"ordinary" path 'Of industrialization ;mcl commenced the industrialization of the '·mint ry by developing heavy industry.
This was ;1 vny difficult task, but one that could be ac-cornplishecl.
It was greatly facititated by ·the naLion<llization of industry and the banks, which made it possible quickly to collect funds and transfer them to heavy industry.
There can be no doubt that without this it would have been impossible to transform our country into an industrial country in so short a time.
Secondly, by the policy of collectivizingagriculture.
To put an end to our backwardness in agri-culture and to provide the country with the brgest possible amount of marketable grain, cot-ton, and so forth, it was necessary to pass from small peasant farming to large-scale farming, for only large-scaJe farming can employ modern machinery, utilize all the achievements of agri-cultural science and provide the largest possible quantity of marketable produce.
But there are two kinds of large-scale farming -capitalist and collective.
The Communist Party could not take the capitalist path of developing agriculture not only on grounds of principle, but also because~ that path presupposes an exceedingly ·1ong pro-cess of development and calls for the ruination of the peasants and their transformation into agricultural labourers.
The Communist -Party therefore took the path of collectivizing agri-culture, the path of organizing large farms by uniting the peasant farms into collective farms.
The collective method proved to be· an· exceed-ingly progressive method not only because .
it did not call for the ruination of the peasants, but also, and particularly, because it enabled us in the course of several years to cover the entire country with large collective farms capable of employing modern machinery, of utilizing all the achievements of agricult ur;1l science and of pro-viding the country with the largest possible quan-tity of marketable produce.
There is no doubt that without the policy of collectivization we would not have been able to put an end to the age-long backwardness of our agriculture in so short a time.
It cannot be said · that the Party's policy met ·with no resistance.
Not only backward peo-ple, who always refuse' to listen to anything that is new, but even many prominent members of our Party persistently tried to pull our Party back, and by every possible means tried to drag it onto the "ordinary" capitalist path of develop-ment.
All the anti-Party machinations of the Trotskyites and of the Rights, all their "activ-ities" in sabotaging the -measures of our govern-ment, pursued the one object of frustrating the · Party's policy and of hindering industrialization and collectivization.
But the Party yielded neither to the threats of some nor to the howl-ing of others and confidently marched forward in spite of everything.
It is to the Party's cred-it that it did not adjust itself to the backward, that it was not afraid to swim against the cur-rent, and that all the time it held onto its po-sition of the leading force.
There can be no doubt that if the Communist Party had not dis-played this staunchness and perseverance it would have been unable to uphold the policy of industrializing the country and of collectivizing agriculture.
Was the Communist Party able to make proper use of the material potentialities created in this way for the purpose of developing war production and of supplying the Red Army with t lie armarnPnts it needed? I think it was, and that it did so with theutmost success.
Leaving out of account the first year of the war, when the evacuation of industry to the East hindered the work of developing war pro-duction, we can say that during the three suc-ceeding years of the war the Party achieved such successes as _enabled it not only to supply the front with sufficient quantities of artillery, machine-guns, rifles, aeroplanes, tanks and am-munition, but also to accumulate reserves.
More-over, as is well known, the quality of our arma-ments was not only not inferior but, in general, even superior to the German.
It is well known that during the last three years of the war our tank industry produced an-nually an avernge of over 30,000 tanks, self-pro-pelled guns and armoured cars.
(~oud applause.
) It is well known, further, that in the ·same period our aircraft industry produced annually up to 40,000 aeroplanes.
(Loud applause.
) It is also well known that our artillery in-dustry in the same period produced annually up to 120,000 guns of all calibres (loud applause), up to 450,000 light and heavy machine'-guns (loud applause), over 3,000,000 rifles (applause) and about 2,000,000 automatic rifles.
(Applause.
) Lastly, it is well known that our mortar industry in the period of 1942-44 produced an-mrnl ly an average of up to 100,000 mortars.
(Loud applause.
) It goes without saying that simultaneously we produced corn•sponding quantities of artillery shells, mines of various kinds, air bombs, and ri fie and machine-gun cartidges.
It is well known, for example, that in 1944 alone we produced over 240,000,000 shells, bombs and mines (applause) and 7,400,000,000 cartridges.
(Loud applause.
) .
Such is the general picture of the way the Red Army was supplied with arms and ammunit-ion.
As you see, it does not resemble the pict-ure of the way our army was supplied during the first world war, when the front suffered from a chronic shortage of artillery .
and shells, when the army fought without tanks and air-.
craft, and when one rifle was issued for every three men.
As regards supplying the Red Army with food and clothing, it is common knowledge that the front· not only felt no shortage whatever in this respect, but even had the necessary re-serves.
This is how the matter· stands as regards the activities of the Communist Party of our country in the period up to the beginning of the war and during the war.
.
Now a few words about the Communist l';irty's pl:rns of work for the immediate future.
· 1\s vou know, these plans are formulated in the new-Five Year Plan, which is to be adopted in the very near future.
The main tasks of the new Five Year Plan are to rehabilitate the dev-astated regions of our country, to restore in-dustry and agriculture to the pre-war level, and then to exceed that level to a more or less con-sidernble extent.
Apart from the fact that the rationing system is to be abolished in the verv nP;ir future (loud nnd prolonged applausP), special attention will be drvot<'d to the expan-sion of the product ion of nrnsumrr goods, to raising the standord of living of the working pPo-ple by steadily re_ducing tlw prices of all com-moclities (loud and prolong<'d ;1pplaus<:'), and to the extensive organization of scientific research institutes of every kind (<1pplm1se) capable· of giving the fullest scope to our scientific forces.
(Loud applause.
) I have no doubt that if we give our scien-tists proper assistance they wi II be able in the very near future not only to overtake ·but even outstrip the achievements of science beyond the borders of our country.
(Prolonged applause.
) As regards long-term plans, our Party in-tends to organi z<~ nnothf~r powerful uplift of our national eccmomy tlrnt will ('n<:1ble us to rnise our industry to a levPI, srn·, three times as high as that of pr<'-w<ir industn.
We must see to it tlrnt our industry shall be able to produce an-nually up to 50,000,000 tons of pig iron (prolong-ed applause), up to 60,000,000 tons of steel (prolonged applause), up to 500,000,000 tons of coal (prolonged applause) and up to 60,000,000 tons of oil (prolonged applause).
Only when we succeed in doing that can we be sure that our Motherland will be insured against all contingen-cies.
(Loud applause.
) This will need, perhaps, another three Five Year Plan periods, if not more.
I3ut it can be done, and we must do it.
This, then, is my brief report on the activ-ities of the Communist Party during the recent past and on its .
plans of work for the future.
(Loud and prolonged applause).
It is for you to judge to what extent the Party has been and is working on the proper lines (applause), and whether it could not have worked better.
(Laughter and applause).
It is said that the victors are not judged (laughter and applause), that they must not be criticized, that they must not be inquired into.
This is not true.
Victors may and should be judged (laughter and applause), they may and · should be criticized and inquired into.
This is beneficial not only for the cause, but also for the victors (.
laughter ·and applause); there will be lf'ss swell-headedness, and ·there will be more moclC'sty.
· (L1ughter and applause.
) l regard the <'I cc lion campaign as a court of the voters sit-· ting in judgement over the Communist Party as the ruling party.
The result of the election will he the voters' verdict.
(Laughter and applause.
) The Communist Party of our country would not be worth much if it feared criticism · and in-vestigation~ The Communist Party is ready to re-ceive the verdict of the voters.
(Loud applause.
) In this election contest the Communist Party does not stand alone.
It is going to .
the polls in a bloc with the non-Party people.
In the past Communists were somewhat distrustful of non-Party people and of non-Party-ism.
This was due to the fact that various bourgeois groups, who thought it was not to their advant-age to come before the voters witl1out a mask, not infrequently used the non Party flag as a screen.
This was the casf' i11 the past.
Times are different now.
Non-Party people are now seperated from .
·the bourge< ;r by a barrier cal-led the Soviet social system.
And on this side of the barrier th~ non-Party people are united with the Communists in one, common, collective body of Soviet people.
Within this collective body they fought side by side to consolidate the might of our country, they fought side by side and shed their blood on the various fronts for the sake of freedom and greatness of our Motherland, and side by side they hammered out .
and forged our country's victory over her enem-ies.
The only difference between them is that some belong to the Party and sqme don't.
But this difference is only a formal one.
The import-ant thing is that all are engaged In one common cause.
That is why the Communist and non-Party bloc is a natural and vital thing.
'(Loud and prolonged applause).
In conclusion, permit me to express my thanks for the confidence which you have shown me (loud and prolonged applause.
A voice: "Cheers for the great leader of all our victor-ies, Comrade Stalin!") by nominating me as a candidate for the Supreme Soviet.
You need have no doubt that I will do my best to ·justify your confidence.

Dear Comrade Rasin, I have received your letter of 30 January on Clausewitz and your short thesis on war and the art of war.
· 1.
You ask if Lenin's standpoint on the judgement of Clausewitz is no longer valid.
In my.
opinion the question is wrongly put.
By putting the question in such a way one could believe that Lenin had analyzed the sci-ence of war and the works of Clausewitz judged them from a milit11ry viewpoint, and had left us a ~umber of guidelines on military quest-ions.
Putting the question in such a way is wrong because there are no such "Theses" of Lenin on Clausewitz's teachings on the art of war.
Unlike Engels, Lenin did not believe him-self to be an expert on rn i 1it arv matters, -nei-ther Ix' fore tlw Octolwr l~(·vol11t ion, nnr in t lw period up to tlw end nf tlw ( iv1I W:ir.

lk unlwsit;1ting-ly declared that it was f(ln l;1tc for him to be-· come a military expert.
This explains why Len-in, in his judgement on Clausewitz and his re-marks on Clnusewitz's works, does not touch upon solely military aspects such as questions of military strategy and tactics and their relation to each other, the relation between attack and rPtreat, defence <Ind counter-offensive ahd so on.
Whnt w:is Lenin's int ('r<'st.
in Cl~lUsewitz :111d wflv did lw :wk111iwfr·<il',(' 11i111'> Lenin al'knowlqr,<'d ( 1:111.
s(•witz who w<1s not a !'vlarxist, and who was rt'<"ogni zed as an author-ity in the field of military tlwory because in his works he confirmed the known Marxist theory that there is a direct relation between war and politics, that politics can engender war and that war is the continuation of politics by force.
Here, Lenin needed Clausewitz to prove that Plekhanov, Kautsky and others had fallen once more into social chauvinism and social imperial-ism.
He further acknowledged Clausewitz in that he confirmed the Marxist viewpoint in his works that under certain unfavourable conditions, -re-treat is as justifiable a military action as is attack.
Lenin needed Clausewitz to disprove the t hE;ory of the "left" Communists who denied that retreat could be a justifiable military c1ction.
In this way, not as a military expert, but :1s ;1 pol it i<'i:11.
1, Lenin used the works of Clause-1.
vit 1, ;m<I w:1~; mainly interested in those quest-11111'' 111 1 lw w<Jrks of Clausewitz which showed 1iH' J"!'f;it io11 lwlween war and politics.
Thus, as successors of Lenin, there are no r<'slrictions on us in the criticism of the mili-tary doctrine of Clausewitz, as there are no re-marks of Lenin that could hinder us in our free criticism.
Thus, your judgement on the article of Comrade Meshtsherjakov (in "Wojennaja Mys!," No.
6/7, 1945), which .
criticises the military doc-trine of Clausewitz, regarding it as a "Revision" of Lenin's judgement is completely unjustified.
2.
Do we have reason at all to criticise the military doctrine of Clausewitz? Yes, we have.
In the interests of our cause and the mod-ern science.
of war, we are obliged not only to criticise Clausewitz, but also Moltke, Sclieffen, Ludendorff, Keitel and other exponents of Ger-man military ideology.
· During the last thirty years Germany has twice forced a bloody war on the rest of the world and twice has suffered defeat.
Was this accidental? Of course not.
Does this not mean that not only Germany as a whole, but also its military ideology has· not stood the test? Obviously.
It is well known that the military of the whole world, also our Rus-sian military, looked up to the German militaryauthorities.
Is it not time to put an.
end to this undeserved respect? Absolutely.
So, this can on-ly be clone by criticism, especially from our side, especially from the side of those who have won the victory ovPr GPrmany.
Concerning "Clausewitz, as an authority in the field of military nuthority, he is of course out of date.
On the wholP,, -Clausewitz was a representative of the timP of manufacture in war, but now we are in the machine age of war.
Undoubtedly the machine age of war re-quires new military ideologies.
Thus, it would be ridiculous to follow the teachings of Clausewitz today.
One cannot make progress and further science without a critical analysis of the anti-quated theories of well known authorities.
This applies not only to the authorities.
in war theory bu_t also to the Marxist classics.
Engels once said of the Russian Commanders of 1812, that Gen.
Barclay de Tolley was the only one of any relevance.
Engels was of course wrong, as Kut-usov was of greater importance by far.
·Never-' heless there are people in our time who did n_ot hesitate to def end this wrong judgement of [,ngels.
.
In our criticism we must not be guided by single remarks and judgements from the classics, hut must be guided by Lenin's well known guide-line: · do not regard the theory of Marx as "We finnl and untouchable; on the con-somPthing trary, ·we are convinced that it has lnid the founcla t ions of that science that the Socialists must develop i11 t'.

The Lern1i11ol()gy taken from Clausewitz, talking of the grammar and logic of war hurts ones eurs.
The question of the faction-al character of war theory is µrimitively posed.
The hymns of pruise to StaliM also pain the ears, it hurts to read them.
Also, the chapter on counter-offensive (not to be confused with counter-attack) is missing.
I am talking of the counter-offensive after a successful but indecis-ive enemy offensive, during which the defend-ers assemble their forces to turn to a counter-offensive and strike a decisive blow to the en-emy and inflict defeat upon him.
I am of the opinion that a well organized counter-offensive is a very interesting method of offensive.
You, as an historian should be interested in this.
The old Parthens were already acquainted with sucha counter-offensive when they lured the Roman .
c;=ommander Crassus and his army .
into the in-terior of their country aod, turning to counter-offensive, destroyed him· and his troops.
Our brilliant Commander, Kutusov, executed this when he destroyed Napoleon and his army by ~ well prepared· counter-offensive.

efJw~y, 1946 Comrades soldiers and sailors of the Red Army and Red Navy, non-commissioned officers, officers and generals! Today we are.
celebrating the twenty-eighth anniversary of the existence of the Red Army.
The Red Army commemorates its twenty-eighth anniversary in the glow of the glorious victory over the German and Japanese imperial-ists.
Engaged in a prolonged and arduous war, the Red Army has emerged as a first-class army of the highest morale and fighting force, equipped with modern armaments and cadres of great experience, tempered by battle.
In the war against the fascist invaders the Red Army has shown its high quality, and it has shown that it is able to defend the interests of the Soviet state effectively, faithfully and staunchly.
Our soldiers, officers and generals have justified the confidence of the people and li~ive shown their great devotion towards our Motherland.
The Red Army has proved to the Soviet people that they can have confidence in it.
The peo-.
pie of our country have great trust in their army and its victories, and will keep the sacred memory of their heroes who fell in the battles for the Motherland.
The remarkable victories of the Red Army are explained, above all, by the fact that it is a truly popular army that defends the interests of its people.
The Soviet people love their army ardently, and are a constant source nf its re-· inforcement and of its strength.
This has been shown especially in the time of the Great Pat-riotic War.
All .
our people have worked un-hesitatingly, day and night, for victory.
With-out this work, without this self-sacrificing of the workers, peasants and intellectuals, without their material and moral support,· the Red Army would not have defeated the enemy.
The victories of the Red Army are also ex-plained by the fact that it was led and educat-ed by the Communist Party.
furthermore, the behests of the great Lenin helped the Soviet people, under the guidance of the Communist Party, to transform our country from a back-ward land to a land of progress, from an agra-rian to an industrial country.
On this basis was founded all the material possibilities for the vic-torious struggle of the Red Army against its en-munist Party 'united all th.
e countries of the Sov-iet Union into a single military camp, and has onentated all the efforts of the people and the army towards a single aim -the destruction of the enemy•.
The Communist Party has educated the Soviet soldier in the sense and aims of.
the war, it has cultivated love for the Motherland •, ' constantly reinforced ~heir fighting spirh and in-· · spired their staunchness and discipline.
All this ·1as created the conditions for our victory.
After the .
victory over the enemies the Soviet Union h~s entered into a new period: into .
.

eful period of economic development.
The "esent task of ,the Soviet people is to assure ·_: conquered positions ·and to go forward in a ,,;w economic effort.
We cannot only assure our position as this woul_d mean stagnation; we have to go forward and create the conditions for a new an~ pow_erful effort of the national econ-omy.
To put it in.
a word, we have to heal the wounds inflicted on our country by the enemy and reacb the pre-war level of the national ec-onomy before we can make considerable pro-gress; we have to raise the material well-being of our people and we have to raise the econom-ic and military ability of the Soviet state.
U~~er these new conditions, the Red Army must v1g1lantly protect the creative work of the Soviet people, must solidly guarantee the inter-ests of the Soviet Union and protect the bor-ders of our Motherland and make them inacces-sible to any enemy.
During the war the main task of the sol-diers, officers and generals of the Red Army consisted of attaining the victory, to concen-trate all their knowledge and efforts on the tot-al annihilation of the enemy.
In these peaceful times the prime task of our soldiers, officers and generals, without exception, consists of per-fecting their military and political abilities.
All our soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Red Army have to intensively study mili-tary art, have to know their weapons well and perform their duty irreproachably.
Now, more than ever, the officers have to be able to ed-ucate and instruct their subordinates.
During the war the officers and generu~s of the Red Army knew well how to lead their troops in battle.
Now these officers and gener-als have to become perfect masters in the ed-ucation and instruction of their troops in pres-ent times.
The Great Patriotic War has introduced much that is new in the militar-y art.
The com-bat experience represents a rich treasure for the instruction and education of the troops.
That is why all the instruction of the army should be based on the intelligent application of the experiences of the war.
It is also necessary to utilize this experience in all fields for the theoretical instruction of the cadres and of-ficers, for the enriching of Soviet military science.
One must ensure that the military ·art develops constantly and swiftly.
The Red Army is obliged not only to follow the developn:ient of the military art but to further progress it.
TheRed Army is equipped with first-class military material which constitutes the basis for its ab-ility in combat.
It knows how to handle this equipment perfectly and it treats it as the ap-ple of it~ eye.
Any successes in the instruction and ed-ucation.
of its -troops is impossible without with-out discipline and a strict military order, be-.
.
ause the effectiveness of an army depends on is.
This applies especially to the adjutants and crgeants who .
are the immediate superiors and rect teachers of the soldiers of the Red ·.
rmy.
T}le soldiers, officers and generals of the {ed Army have great m~rit with the people and Lhe Motherland.
But they must not become com-placent and vain about this, they must not rest upon their laurels, -but they must ·conscientious-ly carry out their duties and they must devote all their strength and knowledge to the service of the Red Army•.
That is what is demanded of all Soviet soldiers.
.
Comrades soldiers and sailors of the Red Army and Red Navy, non-commissioned officers, oficers and generals!.
In the name of the Soviet government and our Communist Party, I greet and congratulate you on the occasion of the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Red Army.
To celebrate the day of the Red Army, today, 23 February, I order: A salute of twenty artillery salvoes in the capital of our Motherland, Mos-cow, in the capitals pf the federative republics and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sebastopol and Odessa.
Long live our victorious Red Army! Long live our victorious sailors of the war! Loi;ig live our glorious Communist Party! Long live the great Soviet people! Long live our powerful Motherland! J.

.
ch.
, 7946 The otner day a "Pravda" correspondent asked Comrade Stalin to clarify a number o( · questions connected with Mr.
Churchill's Speech.
\:low are given Comrade Stalin's replies to the ,uestions put by.
the correspondent.
· Q.
How do you appraise the latest Speech 'v1r.
Churchill delivered.
in the United States of America? A.
I appraise it.
as a dangerous act cal-culated to sow the seeds of discord between the Allied states and hamper their cooperation.
Q.
Can .
Mr.
Churchill's Speech be regarded as harmful to the cause of peace and security? A.
Unquestionably, yes.
As a matter of fact, Mr.
Churchill's position is now that of the incendiaries of war.
And Mr.
Churchill is not al-one in this -he has fri_ends not only in England but in the United States of America as well.
It should be not~d that in this respect Mr.
Churchill and his friends strikingly resemble Hit-ler and his friends.
Hitler set out to unleash war by proclaiming the race theory, declaring that the German-speaking people constituted a superior nation.
Mr.
Churchill sets out to un-leash war also with a race theory, by asserting that the English-speaking nations are superior nations called upon to decide the destinies of .
the entire world.
The German race theory led Hitler and his friends to the conclusion that the Germans as the only superior nation must domin-ate other nations.
The English race theory leads Mr.
Churchill and his friends to the conclusion that the English-speaking nations, as the only superior nations, must dominate the other na-tions of the world.
As a matter of fact, Mr.
Churchill and his friends in England and the U.
S.
A.
are presenting something in the nature of an ultimatum to na-tions which po not speak English: recognize our domination voluntarily and then everything will be in order -olherwise war is inevitable.
But the 11atio11s shed Lheir blood during five years of fierce war for Lite sake of the freedom and indep1'.
rtclence of Lheir countries, and not for the s<ike of r-cpladng the domi-nation of the Hitlers by the doinirialion of the Churchills.
Therefore, it is quite probable that the nations which do not speak· English and at the same time constitute the vast majority of the world's population, will not agree to submit to the new slavery.
Mr.
Churchill's tragedy is that he, as an inveterate Tory, does not understand this simple and obvious truth.
Undoubtedly, Mr.
Churchill's line is that of war, a call to war against the U.
S.
S.
R.
It is al-so clear tl1at this !J11t; of Mr.
Churchill is incom-patible with tlw cx1.
--;L111g treaty of alliance be-tween Br1tu1r1 <.
llld tilt~ U.
S.
S.
I<.
True, in order to confuse the readers, Mr.
Churchill states in pass-·1g that the term of the Soviet-British treaty of mutual assistance and cooperation could per-fectly well be extended to fifty years.
But how can such a statement by Mr.
Churchill be recon-ciled with his line of war against the U.
S.
S.
R.
, with his, preaching of war against the U.
S.
S.
R? Clearly these -things cannot be reconcil~d by any.
means.
And if Mr.
Churchill, who is calling for · war against the Soviet Union, at the same time 'celieves it possible to extend the term of the Anglo-Soviet tr:eaty to fifty years, that means •hat ·he regards this treaty as a mere scrap of aper which he needs.
only to cover up and camouflage his 'anti-Soyiet' line.
Therefore we cannot treat seriously .
the hypocritical statement of Mr.
Churchill's friends in Eligland concerning the extension of the term of the· Soviet-British • treaty to fifty years or more.
The extension of the term of the treaty is meaningless if one of the parties violates the treaty and turns it into a mere scrap of paper.
·.
Q.
How do you appraise that part of Mr.
Churchill's Speech in which he attacks the demo-cratic system in the European states neighbour-ing with us and in which he criticizes the good-neighbourly relations established between these states and the Soviet Union? A.
This part of Mr.
Churchill's Speech re-presents a mixture of elements of slander with elements of rudeness and tactlessness.
Mr.
Churchill asserts that "Warsaw, lkrlin, Prague, Vien,na, Budapest, Belgr;Hic, Buch~tn~st, Sofia -all these famous cities ;,rnd popul.
1t1()fJ~.
around them lie within the Soviet sphere and all are subject in one form or another not only to Soviet ·influence but to a very high and increas-ing measure of control from Moscow.
" Mr.
Churchill describes all this as boundless "ex-pansionist tendencies" of the Soviet Union.
No special efl(Jrt is necessary to prove that in this case !Vlr.
Cllurcllill is rudely and shamelessly sla11Jeri11g both Mo-;cow and the above-mentioned states neighbouring with the U.
S.
S.
R.
Firstly, it is utterly absurd to speak of ex-clusive control of the U.
S.
S.
R.
in Vienna and l:3erlin, where there me Allied Control Councils composed of representatives of the four states and where the u.
s.
s.
R.
has only one-fourth of the votes.
It does lwppen that some people can-not help slandering, but even then there should be a limit.
Secondly, one 111ust not forget the follow-ing fact.
The Cvrn1a11s invaded the U.
S.
S.
R.
tltrough Finland, l)old11<.
1, k.
umania, Bulgaria, Hun-gary .
.
The Cerrnw1:; were able to effect the in-Vd:-;io11 by wuy ut Lht;se countries because at th<Jt time govcrn111,·11Ls hostile to the Soviet Union existed iu lll~'.
se countries.
Owing to the German invasion, t Ile Soviet Union irrevocably lost in battles with the Germans and also Ds a result of German occupation and the driving off of Soviet people to German penal servitude, some 7 ,000,000 persons.
In other words the Soviet Union lost several times more people than Britain and the United States of Americataken together.
Possibly some quarters are in-clined to consign to oblivion these colossal sac-rifices · of the Soviet people which secured the liberation of Europe from the Hitlerite yoke.
But the.
Soviet Union cannot forget them.
Th~ question aris~s, what can there be surprfsing about the fact.
that the Soviet Union, desiring to insure its security in the future, seeks to· ~1chieve ·a situation when· those countries will ve governments maintaining a friendly attitude ·ds the Soviet Union? How can anyone who not gone mad describe these peaceful as-'"<.
Hions of the Soviet .
Union as expansionist ten-cies of our state? .
Mr.
Churchill further states that "the Rus-sian-dominated Polish government has been en-couraged to make · enormous wrongful inroads upon Germany.
" Here every word is rude and offensive slan-der.
Present-day democratic Poland is guided by · outstanding men.
They ·have proved by deeds that they are capable of def ending the interests and dignity of their homeland in a manner of which their predecessors were not capable.
What grounds has Mr.
Churchill to assert that the leaders of present-day Poland can permit the "domination" of repr~sentatives of any foreign states whatever in their country? ls it not be-cause Mr.
Churchill intends to sow the seeds of discord in the relations between Poland and the Soviet Union that he slanders "the Russians" here? .
•.
• Mr.
Churchill is displeased with the fact that Poland has effected a turn in her policy to-wards friendship and alliance with the U.
S.
S.
R.
There was a time when elements of conflict and contradiction prevailed in the relations between Poland and the U.
S.
S.
R.
That furnished states-.
men of Mr.
Churchill's kind with an opportunity to play on these contradictions, to lay their hands on Poland under the guise of protecting her from the Russians, to intimidate Russia with the spectre of war between her and Poland, and to reserve the position of arbitrators for them-selves.
But that time is past, for the enmjty be-tween Poland and Russia has yielded place to friendship between them, while Poland, present-day democratic Poland, does not want to be tos-sed around like a ball by foreigners any longer.
It seems to me that it is this very circumstance that irritates Mr.
Churchill and impels him to rude, tactless sallies against Poland.
lt is no joke: he is not allowed to play his game at someone else's expense .
.
.
.
As regards Mr.
Churchill's attacks on the Soviet Union in connection with Poland's extend-ing her western frontiers into Polish territories seized by the Germans in the past, here, it seems to me, he is obviously sharping.
It is wcJ l known that the decision on Poland's western frontiers was adopted at the Berlin Conference of the Three Powers on the basis of Poland's de-mands.
The Soviet Union has repeatedly st ntr>d that it regards Poland's dema11ds correct and just.
lt is quite probable that Mr.
Churchill is displeased with that decision.
But why then doesMr.
Churchill, while sparing no arrows against the position of the Russians in this matter, con-ceal from his readers the fact that the decision was adopted at the Bertin Conference unanimous-ly, that not the Russians alone but the British and the Americans too voted for this decision"? Why did Mr.
: Churchill need to mislead people? · Mr.
Churchill further asserts ·that "the Communist parties, which were previously very small in all these eastern states of Europe, have been raised to pre~eminence and ·power far be-yond their numbers, and seek everywhere to ob-tain totalitarian control.
Police governments pre-vail in nearly every case, and thus far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy.
" It is well known that in .
Britain the state is now governed by one party, the Labour Party, while the opposition parties are devoid of the right to participate in the government of Brit-ain.
This is what Mr.
Churchill calls true demo-cracy.
Poland, Rum.
ania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary are governed by blocs of several parties -from four to six parties -while the op-position, if it is m.
or~ or less loyal, is secured the right of participating in the government.
This is what Mr.
Churchill calls totalitarianism, tyranny, police rule.
Why and on what grounds -do not expect an answer from Mr.
Churchill.
' Mr.
Churchill does not understand in what a rid-iculous position he places himself by his vocif er-ous speeches about totalit?rianism, tyranny, po-lice rule.
Mr.
Churchill would like Poland to be gov-erned by Sosnkowski and Anders; Yugo_slavia _by Mikhailovic and Paveltc; Ruma11ia by Prince Stir-bei and Radescu; I lungary and Austria by some king of the house of l lapsburgs, and so forth.
Mr.
· Churchill wants to convince us that these gentlemen from the fascist backyard are capable of securing "true democracy.
" Such is Mr.
Churchill's "democracy.
" Mr.
Churchill is wandering about the truth when he speaks of the growth of the influence of ·the Communist parties in Eastern Europe.
It should be noted, however, that he is not quite accurate.
The influence of the Communist par-ties has grown not only in Eastern Europe but in almost all the countries of Europe where fascism ruled before {Italy, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, Rumaitia, Finland), or where German, Italian or Hungarian occupation took place (Fr-ance, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Denmark, Po-land, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Soviet Union, and so forth.
) The growth of the influence of the Com-munists cannot be regarded as fortuitous.
It is a perfectly legitimate phenomenon.
The in-fluence of the Communists has grown because in the hard years of fascist domination in Eur-ope the Communists proved reliable, cour~geous, self-sacrificing fighters against the fascist re-gime, for the freedom of the peoples.
Mr.
Churchill sometimes mentions in his speeches "the simple people of cottages," patting them ~n the back in a lordly manner and poslllg as their friend.
But these people are not so simple as•hey· may seem at· first glance.
They, these "sim-:e people," have their own views, their own pol-.
y, and they are able to stand up for them-~lves.
It is they, the millions of these "simple people," who· voted down Mr.
Churchill and his party in· England by casting their votes for the.
Labourites.
It 1s .
they, the millions of these "sim-ple people," who isolµted the reactio-naries in·· Europe, the adherents of collaboration with fasc-:sm, and gave preference to the left democratic parties.
It is t~ey, the millions of these "simple people," who tested the Communists in the fire of struggle and resistance to fascism and de.
:.
cided thut the ,communists fully deserve the people's trust.
That is how the influence of the Communists has grown in Europe.
Such is the law of historical development.
· Naturally, Mr.
Churchill does not like such a course of development and he sounds the al-arm, appealing to for:ce.
· But he similarly did not like the birth of tf-!e.
Soviet regime in Rus-sia after.
the First World War.
Then too he sounded the alarm and organized the military campaign of "14 states" ·against Russia, setting himself the goal of turning the wheel of history back.
Yet history proved stronger than Church-illian intervention, and Mr.
Churchill's quixotic ways brought about his utter defeat.
I do not know whether Mr.
Churchill and his friends will succeed in organizing after the Second World War a new military campaign against "Eastern Europe.
" But should they succeed -which is hardly probable, since millions of "simple people" are guarding the cau::;e (1f peace -one can confiuently say tl10t they will be beaten just us they were beaten in the past, twenty-six years ago.
("Soviet Calendar 1917 -1947") INTERVIEW WITH THE CORRESPONDENT OF ASSOCIATED PRESS, GILMORE Q.
What significance do you believe.
the United Nations Organization has as a means of maintaining international peace? A.
I think the United Nations Organization is of great importance because it is an import-ant instrument for the maintaining of peace and international security.
The strength of this inter-national Organization lies in the principle of the equality of states and not on the domination of some over the rest.
If the United Nations Or-ganization manages to maintain the principle of equality it will definitely play a great and pos-itive role in ensuring general peace and secur-ity.
Q.
In your opinion, what is causing the present general fear of war in many people and countries? A.
I am convinceu that neither the nations nor their armies want a new war, -they wantpeace and are trying to maintain it.
Thus, "the.
present fear of war" is not caused from this side.
I am of the opinion that "the present fear ~f.
war" is caused by the actions of some po-ht1cal groups that engage in propaganda for a new war and in this way sow the seeds of· dis-trust and insecurity.
Q.
What must t~e .
governments of the free.
:.
dam-loving countries do to secure peace and calm in the whole world? A.
It is l)ecessary for the public and the government circles of the states to organize counter-propaganda on a broad basis against the propagandists of' a new war, for the securing of peace, so that the campaign of the propagand-ists of a new war meets adequate resistance from the public and the press, -so that the ar-sonists of war are unmasked in time and denied the possibility of using freedom of speech again-st the interests of peace.

1 ~ay, 1946 Comrades of the Red Army and Red Navy, Sergeants and Mates! Comrades Officers,· Generals and Admirals! Working people o' the Soviet Union! For the first time since the victory in the Great Patriotic War we celebrate the First of May, the international holiday of the working people, under peaceful conditions, which we have reached after hard struggle against the en-emy and at the pt1l:e of great sacrifices and su flerings.
A year ago t lw Hed Army raised the ban-11cr of v1l°lory over lk~rli11 alld finished off the smashing of fascist Germany.
Four months after the victory over Germany, imperialist japan capitulated.
The Second World War, prepared by the forces of international reaction and started by the main fascist states, ended in complete victory for the freedom-loving peoples.
The smashing and liquidation of the cen-tres of fascism and world aggression led to a profound change in the political life of the peoples of the world and to a profound growth of the democratic movement of the people.
Ripened by the experiences of war, the masses learned that they should not leave the fate of their states in the hands of reactionary leaders who follow limited, self-seeking class interests against the people.
Thus, the people who want to change their lives take the fate of their state into their own hands and erect a democrat-ic order and lead an active struggle against the reactionary powers, against the arsonists of a new war.
The ·peoples of the whole world do not want another war.
They struggle desperately for the ensuring of peace and security.
In the vanguard of the struggle for peace and security marches the Soviet Union, which has played a leading role in the smashing of fascism and has fulfilled her high mission of liberation.
The peoples· who· were liberated by the So-viet Union from the fascist yoke were given the possibility of founding their states on democrat-ic ·principles and to realize their historical hopes.
.
On this path they receive the fraternal help of the &oviet Union~ · The whole world was able to convince it-:.
;elf not only of the .
power of the Soviet state,· but also of the .
just character of its politics, based on the recognition of the equality of all peoples, based; on respect for their freedom and self.
:.
determination.
There is no reason to doubt that the Soviet Union.
will, in the future, con-tinue these polltics which are the politics of peace and security, equality and friendship of the peoples.
· Since the ending of the war, the Soviet Union is progressing in peaceful socialist con-struction.
With great .
enthusiasm the Soviet people are continuing the peaceful constructive work that was interrupted by the war.
The Five Year Plan for the reconstruction and development of the people's economy of the U.
S.
S.
R.
, for the years 1946 -1950, that has been approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, opens new perspectives for the further growth of the · productive forces of our Motherland, the stri!ngthening of its economic power, the raising of its material wealth and its culture.
The five Year Plan was accepted by the workers, peasants and intelligentsia of our count-ry as a programme entirely meeting their inter-'.
ests.
It can be expected that the Soviet people, led by the Communist Party, will spare no ef-fort not only to fulfil this five Year Plan, but also to over-fulfil it by their enedeavours.
While we develop this peaceful socialist construction we must not at any moment forget · the machinations of international reaction, its plans for a new war.
One must not forget the guidelines of the great Lenin that during the transition to peaceful work one must constantly be alert, and constantly keep an eye on the strength of the armed forces and their ability to defend our ·country.
The armed forces of the Soviet Union, our army, our airforce and our navy have fulfilled their duty towards our Motherland in the Great Patriotic War.
The new task for our armed for-ces is to be on guard, to protect the peace and the constructive work of the Soviet people, and to safeguard the interests of the Soviet Union.
The successful fulfillment of this honour-able task is possible only under the conditions of further development of the military culture and art of war of the fighters and commanders of our army, our navy and our airforce.
The armed forces of the Soviet Union have to raise their standcirds in the art of war, based on the experiences uf war, based on the develop-ment of the science ci11d technique of war.
There is no duubt that uur army, our fleet ;,mu our <.
.
Hrfon:e will honourably fulfil their task.
Comrades ol tl1e Red Army and Red Navy,Sergeants and Mates! Comrade Officers, Mates and Generals! Comrades working men and women, men and women peasants, intellectuals! Demobilized fighters of the Red Army! In· the name of the government and · the Communist Par.
ty, I greet you and congratulate you on the occasion of· the First of M·ay, on the· occasion of the international holiday of the working people, and I order: Today, l.
May, in the capital of our Moth-· ,, er land, Moscow, in the capitals of the Union Re-· publics as well as in Lvov, Konigsberg, Chabar-ovsk, Vladivostok, Port-Arthur and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol and Odessa, a salute of 20 artillery ·salvoes.

STALIN ("Pravda," 9 May, 1946)ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS Of THE MOS-COW CORRESPONDENT Of THE "SUNIJA Y TIMES", MR.
ALEXANDER WERTH, IN A LET-TER Of 17 SEPTEMBER, 1946 Q.
Do you think there is a real danger of , "new war," which is being so irresponsibly talked about in .
the whole world at the moment? What steps should.
be taken to prevent this war, if such a danger exists?.
A.
I do not believe in the actual danger of a new war.
The clamour about a new war now comes mainly from military-political secret agents and the people behind them in the ad-ministration.
They need this alarm, if only for the purpose of spreading it in the areas of their opposition.
a) Certain naive .
politicians try to get as many concessions as possible out of the op-position and help their own government by frightening people with the spectre of war; 1 b) to hinder the reduction of.
military bud-gets in their countries for.
a certain time; c) to block the demobilization of their troops and thereby guard against a swift rise in unemployment numbers in their countries.
One must differentiate between the pres-ent clamour and outer/.
: about a "new war," and the real danger of a 'new war," which does not exist at the present time.
Q.
Do you think that Great Britain and the United States of America are deliberate-ly carrying out a "capitalist encirclement" of the Soviet Union? A.
I am not of the opinion that Great .
Britain and the United States of America could carry out a "capitalist encirclement" of the So-viet Union even if they wanted to, which, in any case, I do not maintain.
Q.
To quote Mr.
Wallace in his last speech, can England, Western Europe and the United States be sure that Soviet politics in Ger-many will not be turned into a Russian instru-ment against Western Europe? A.
I believe that the possibility of Ger-many .
making profitable moves through the So-viet Union, against Western Europe and the Un-ited States can be excluded.
I think that it can be excluded also, not only because the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France are bound by their joint and mutual support against German aggression and through the decisions of the Pots-dam Conference which bind these three powers to the United States, but also because Ger-many's political exploitation against Western Eu-· rope and the United States of America would mean a deviation on the part of the Soviet Union from their fundamental national interests.
To put it in a nutshell, the politics of the So-viet Union in relation to the German problem is restricted by itself to the demilitarization and democratization of Germany.
I believe that the demilitarization and democratization of Ger-many to be the most meaningful guarantee for the building of a stable and lasting peace.
Q.
What is your opinion about the accusa-tion that the politics of the Communist parties in Western Europe "are directed by Moscow"? A.
·I regard this accusation as an absurdity that people have borrowed from the bankrupt arsenal of Hitler and ~oebbels.
· Q.
Do you believe i.
n the possibility of a friendly and lasting cooperation between the Soviet Union anc:I the Western democracies, de-spite.
the existing ideological differences, and in "friendly competition" between the two systems, ;is Wallace mentioned in his speech? A.
I firmly believe in that.
Q.
During the stay of the· deputation from the Labour Party in the Soviet Union, you have, ·.
as far as I have been informed, expressed cer-tainty regardihg the friendly relations between the Soviet.
Union and .
Great Britain.
What would help to establish these relations which the major-ity of the.
English people· obviously desire? A.
I am really certain of the possibility of friendly relations bet.
ween the Soviet Union and Great Britain.
The strengthening of the political, economic and cultural ties between these count-ries would contribute enormously to the con-struction.
of such relations.
Q.
Do you believe that the earliest pos-sible withdrawal of all American troops from China would be of the greatest significance for future peace? A.
Yes, I believe so.
Q.
Do you believe that the actual 1110110-poly of the United States on the atom bomb to be one of the greatest threats to peace? A.
I do not think that the atom bomb is such a power as certain politicians are disposed to state.
The atom bomb is intended to frighten people with weak nerves, but it cannot decide the fate of a war, and would under no circum-stances suffice for this purpose.
Certainly, the monopoly on the secrets of the atom bomb po-ses a threat, but against that there are at least two things: a) The monopoly on the possession of the atom bomb cannot last long; b) the use of the atom bomb will be for-bidden.
Q.
Do you believe that with the funher progress of Communism in the Soviet Union, the possibility of friendly cooperation with the out-side world, as far as the Soviet Union is con-cerned, will not be reduced? ls "Communism in one country" possible'? A.
I have no doubt that the possibility of peaceful cooperalio11 will not be reduced, far from it, but could even be made stronger.
"Com-munism in one country" is absolutely possible, especially in a country like the Soviet Union.

Q.
Do you believe that the four occupied zones in Germany must be united as regards ec-onomic administration in the near future, to bring G_ermany back to economic unity and to lighten the burden of the four powers of oc-cupation? A.
One must bring back not only the ec-onom,ic but also the political unity of Germany.
Q.
Do you consider it possible to establish a certain central administration which should be put in the hands of the Germans themselves, although under· Allied control, and whereby the Council of Foreign Ministers would be made pos-sible, to work out the peace treaty for Ger-many?A.
Yes, i consider that to be possible.

In the West, that is, in Germany, Aus-tria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Rumania and Poland, the Soviet Union has at the moment 60 divisions altogether, (artillery and tank divisions togeth-er), most of them not in full amount.
In Yugo-slavia you will find no Soviet troops.

STALIN \ "Slaviane," 1, 1947, Moscow)' INTERVIEW WITH ELLIOT ROOSEVELT Q.
·Do you believe that it is possible in this world for a democracy such as the United States to live peacefully side by side with a Communist model of state administration, such as there is in the Soviet Union, without one or the other side attempting to interfere in the in-ternal politics of the other side? A.
Yes, of course.
That is not only pos-sible, it is sensible and thoroughly realizable.
During the time of the war, the differences be-tween our two forms of government did not hin-der us from uniting and 'defeating our enemy.
In peace, it is possible to an even greater extent, to maintain these relations.
Q.
Do you believe that the success of the United Nations depends on agreement between the Soviet Union, England and the United States on basic questions of politics and their aims? A.
Yes, I believe so.
In many respects the fate of the United Nations Organization as an organization, depends on the bringing about of harmony between these three powers.
Q.
Do you believe, Generalissimo, that the bringing about of an economic treaty on a large scale on the mutual exchange of industrial pro-duction and raw materials between our two coun.
tries, would be an important step towards general peace? A.
Yes, I accept that it would be an im-portant step towards the construction of general peace.
Of course I agree to that.
A furthering of international trade would, in many respects, encourage the development of good relations be-t ween our two countries.
Q.
Is the Soviet Union in favour of the Security Council of the United Nations im-mediately creating an international police force with the participation of all the military forces of the United Nations, so that everywhere that peace is threatened by the prospect of war, it can immediately intervene? A.
Of course.
Q.
If you are of the opinion that the United Nations should control the atom bomb, must that not be done through inspection andthe establishment of control over all research institutes and industrial.
plants that produce any manner of weapons, as well as over the peace-ful application and development of atomic energy? .
(At this .
point, Elliot Roosevelt adds: St.
alin immediately asked: "In general?" I said: "Yes,.
but especially, is the Soviet Union in agreement · in principal with such a plan?") A.
Of course.
On the basis of the principal of equality it • i's not for the Soviet Union to make exceptions.
It must submit to the same rules of inspection and control, like all the other countries.
· .
(At this point Roosevelt remarks: This an-swer followed without hesitation and the quest-i9n of the reservation of the right of veto was not even mentioned.
) Q.
Do you believe that the convocation of a new assembly of the big three for the discus-sion of all international· problems, the present threat to' general peace, would be useful? A.
I am of the opinion that not one as-sembly, but rather several, must take place.
If several assemblies take place, very useful ob-jectives would be served.
(Here Roosevelt remarks: At this moment my · wife asked whether he thought that such meetings would help est~blish closer contacts on lower government levels too.
She also asked whether such cooperation had been achieved through the conferences during the war.
Stalin turned to her and answered with a smile: "There is no doubt about that.
The con-sultations of the war times and the successes achieved have greatly helped by the bringing about of a closer cooperation on lower govern-ment levels.
") Q.
l know that you study many political and social problems that exbt in other count-~i~s.
May I then ask whether you are of the op-1mon that the election that was held in the United States in November, lets us infer that the people are moving away from their belief in Roosevelt's politics in favour of the isolation-ist politics of his political opponents? A.
I am not so well acquainted with the internal life of the people of the United States but it appears to me that the elections let u~ infer that the present government has squander-ed the mqral and political capital that the late President achieved, and have in this way helped the Republican victory.
(At this point Roosevelt adds: The General-issimo answered my next question with great emphasis.
) Q.
What do you think has caused the loosening of the friendly relations and mutual agreements between our two countries since the death of Roosevelt? A.
I am of the opinion that, if this quest-ion concerns the relations and mutual agreement bet ween the American and Russian p e o p l e, they have not deteriorated at all, but on the contrary, they have improved.
Concerning the re-lat10ns of the two governments, there have beenmisunderstandings.
· There was a certain deterior-ation, then a big clamour arose that the re-lations would deteriorate further in the future.
But · I · see nothing frightening in this, in the sense of da·maging peace or in the sense of a military conflict.
No one big po~er is.
pres~n_tly able ,to, even if the government itself JS stnvrng_.
to, raise a big army to fight against another Allied power, to set up another great power, _be-<'Guse at the present nobody can make war with-' the people,· but the people do not want to led into another war.
The people are tired 0f war, besides there is no obvious aim to just-1 fy a new war.
·.
Nobody would know what they were .
fighting for, and so I see nothing to be frightened of, in that some representatives of the government of the United States speak of the deteriora.
tion in our relations.
In regard of all these considerations, l do not believe in the danger of a new war.
· Q.
·Are you for a large scale cultural and economic exchange between our two countries? Are you for an exchange of students, artists, economists and professors? A.
Of course I am.
Q.
Should the United States and the Soviet Union jointly work out, for a calculated long period of time, a policy of assistance to the peoples of the far East? A.
I am of the opinion that this would be useful, if it was possible.
In any case, our gov-ernment is prepared to carry out a joint policy with the United States, in the Far East.
Q.
If a treaty was made between the Un-ited States and the Soviet Union on a system of loans ·and credits, would such a treaty bring con-tinuous advantage to the people's economy of the United States? A.
Such a credit system would undoubtedly be of advantage as much for the United States as for the Soviet Union.
(Here Roosevelt remarks: After that, I put a question that" in many European countries evi-dent anxiety has been aroused.
) Q.
Does the fact that, in the American and English zones in Germany, the de-nazi-fication programme is not being carried through, cause the Soviet government serious concern? A.
No, that is not a cause of serious con-cern, but of course the Soviet Union is not in agreement thcil this part of our joint programme is not being carried through.

eulu 22 JunuU//.
{} 1 1947 received your letter of 18 January, and must admit that your decL ·~ion that Great Britain is bound to nobody , pt the oblig-ations resulting from the Charter, has amazed me.
It seems to me .
that such a declaration without a corresponding explanation, could be misused by the enemies of an English-Soviet friendship.
It is clear to me that regardless 9f the reservations in the English-Soviet treaty· and regardless of how these reservations weaken the impo'rtance of the post war· treaty, ·the exist'.
.
ence of the English-Soviet treaty puts oblig-ations on our countries.
.
I had exactly these circumstances in mind when I explained, in my interview of 17 Sept-ember, 1946 wi.
th Alexander Werth, (a British correspondent in Moscow), that "the Soviet Un-ion has obligations through a mutual support treaty with Great Britain again~t German ag-gression," and consequently has obligations to-wards· Great .
Britain, besides the obligations that result from the Charter.
Your message, however, and the declar-ation of the British government clarifies the matter and leaves no room for misunderstanding.
It is clear by now that you and I share the same opinions on the English-Soviet treaty.
Concerning the prolonging of the English-Soviet Treaty, which is especially mentioned in the declaration of the British government, I have to declare that it is necessary to change the treaty before prolonging it, by freeing it -from its weaker reservations, if you want to talk of such an extension.
Only after this has been done, can one seriously discuss the prolong-ing of the treaty.

7 -B) ORDER OF THE DAY ON THE OCCASION Of ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOVIET ARMY NO.
10 THE 23 Teivuu.
JA_ y, 1947 Comrades soldiers, sailors, officers, gen-erals and admirals! Today our country is celeb-rating the twenty-ninth anniversary of the Sov-iet Army.
The Soviet Army, founded by the great Lenin, has trodden a glorious path.
Its entire his-tory is a living· example of heroism, undeviating attachment to the Motherland and valorous achievements in the military field, which found expression particularly in the magnificent victor-ies won by the Soviet Army in the Great Pa-triotic War.
l'he Motherland will never forget the high heroic deeds of its army.
· The Soviet Army celebrates its twenty-ninth anniversary at the moment when our peo-ple are untiringly accomplishing the tasks set by the devastation of the war, in the re-establish-ment and development of the national economy.
The workers, peasants and intellectuals of our country, who have successfully fulfilled thequotas of the first year of the new five Year Plan, struggle heroically for the rapid acceler-ation of economic activity, for the supplement-ation of production 6f consumer goods, for the rapid progress of Soviet science and technology.
The elections to the Supreme Soviets of the .
federal Republics, which were held, have re-sulte"d in the complete victory of the bloc of Communists and their Party.
It shows that the unity of Soviet society is indestructible, that all rhe Soviet citizens are firmly grouped behind dieir government and the Communist Party, and 3re firmly assuring the development of their Motherland.
In times of peace, the Soviet Army must accomplish the task of military preparation which they have been set, march ·in advance and ·win new and more important successes in mili-.
tary preparation and political educatio11.
Tt1(' work of consolidating peace and the security of our country is required, The essential principle of the military prep-aration of the Soviet armed forces has always consisted, and still.
consists today, of educating the troops in war conditions.
The experience of the last war has proved the high morale.
and combat quality of the troops, a good military and political preparation, a great mastery of the techniques of combat, coordination and great physical endurance.
The task that now faces our army, navy and air force is to untiringly perfect, day by day, their military formation, to profitably pur-sue µrui uund study based on their experience of war.
The generals, admirals and officers must continue to broaden their knowledge of military theory and politics and equally learn the meth-.
ods of military preparation, which are necessary for training in peace time.
The non-commissioned officers must energ-etically apply the process of command to be-come the prime ·aides of officers in the observ-ance of military discipline and in the instruction and education of soldiers and sailors.
The soldiers and sailors must, with all their might, perefct in detail their preparation from the point of view of mastery of weapons, of special military tactics and political form-ations; they must acquire the necessary physical strength to take part in combat and be able to surmount all difficulties of battles and combat.
In the instruction and education of their subordinates, all the commanders and chiefs must take it upon themselves to care for their conditions of !if e, their physical well-being and their equipment, in accordance with the regu-lulions.
Strong military discipline is primarily based on the high conscience and political education of the military and is the preliminary condition ot· most importance for the combat strength of our armed forces.
Also, all the commanders and chiefs must untiringly affirm military discipline und, very necessary, encourage the spirit of pa-triotism unceasingly in their subordinates, thesense of personal· responsibility of every soldier for the defence of the Motherland.
Comrades soldiers, sailors and non-commis-sioned officers! Comrades officers,.
generals and admirals.
! I salute and congratulate you on the · oc-casion of the .
twenty-ninth anniversary of our Soviet Army, in ·the name of the Soviet govern-' · .
'ent and of our Communist Party.
.
In honour of the ·twenty-ninth anniversary uf the Soviet Army, I order: today, 23 February, a salute of twenty artillery salvoes in the capit-al of our Motherland, Moscow, in the capitals of the federative republics, in Koliningrad, Lvov, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok,· Port Arthur and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sebastopol and Odessa.
Long live the Soviet Army and the mili-tary sailors! · Long live our Soviet government! Long live our grea.

Communist Party! Long live our great Soviet people! ("Pravda," 23 February, ~ 94,7) INTERVIEW WITH THE AMERICAN REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDA TE, HAROLD ST ASSEN 9 ApM.
L, 1947 Stassen declared that he was grateful to Stalin for receiving him.
He, Stassen, had want-ed an interview with Stalin as the State leader, to show his respect.
He, Stassen, had undergone an interesting journey through the European countries, and during this journey was p3rticular-ly interested in the economic situation of differ-ent countries after the war.
It was his opinion th;Jt the living stand.
1 <.
b of the people w-i "( gr• ~1t significance for their prosperity.
The .
re-lations between the Soviet Union and the Umted States were of great significance during the war and would also be of further great significance.
He was aware that that the economic systems of the U.
S.
S.
R.
and the United States of Ameri-ca were different.
The economy of the U.
S.
S.
R.
.
was on the principle of planning, was built on Socialist principles and its development led by tlH· Communist Party.
In the United States 1 t1l·re was a free economy with private capital.
It wuuld interest him to know if Stalin was of tl11· opi11io11 th;1t tl!t~se two economic systems l'()uld live side by side in one and the same W<irld, and if they could cooperate t11gether after the war.
Stalin answered that of course the two sys-tems could cooperate together.
The difference between them was of no great essential signifi-cance as far as their cooperation was concern-ed.
The .
economic systems in Germany and .
the United States .
of America were the same, never-thele~ it had come to war between them.
The,.
<.
:conomic systems of the ·United States of Am-''rica and the U.
S.
S.
R.
were different, but it ,,d not led them to war with one another, but .
ther led them ·to coop.
erate during the war.
If o ·different systems could cooperate during d1e war, why should they not be able to co-uperate in peace 'time? Of course, he m~ant by that that cooperation betwee11 two different eco~o~ic systems was .
possible if.
the wish to .
cooperate existed.
But if the wish to cooperate ·dfd not exist,.
then the states and people even of similar economic systems could come into conflict.
Stassen declared that the wish to cooper-ate was , ·of course, of great importance.
How-.
ever earlier, before the war, in both countries, diff~rent declarations· of the impossibility of co-operation had been made.
Before the war, Stalin too had himself declared this.
He, Stassen, wo~ld like to know whether Stalin was of the opinion that the events of the war, the def eat of the fascist Axis of Germany and Japan, had changed the situation, and one could now, if the wish existed, hope for cooperation be~ween the U.
S.
S.
R.
and the United States of America.
hLtve said that the two different systems could not cooperate.
Lenin was the first to express the idea on the cooperation of two systems.
"Lenin is our teacher," said Stalin, "and we So-viet people are Lenin's pupils.
We have never de-viated from Lenin's directives and we never will .
deviate.
" It was possible that he, Stalin, had said that a system, for example the capitalist system, was not willing to cooperate, but this remark concerned the wish to cooperate, but not the possibility of cooperation.
But where the possibility of cooperation was concerned, he, Stulin, stood on Lenin's standpoint that co-operation between two economic systems was possible and desirable.
It w,i:, <.
ilso the wish of the people and the Communist Party of the U.
S.
S.
R.
concerning cooperation; they h~d this wish.
Such .
a cooperation could only be useful for both countries.
Stassen answered that that was clear.
It reminded him of the explanation Stalin had giv-en to the 18th Party Congress and the Plenary Session in 1937.
In this declaration he had spo-ken of "the capitalist environment," and of "monopoly and imperialist development.
" From the explanation that Stalin ha made today, he, Stassen, had inferred that now; ufter the defeat of Japan and Germany, the situation had cl1L111ged.
Stalin declared that at no Party Congress and at no Plenary Session of the Central Com-mit tee of the Communist Party had he spoken, 11or could he have, of the impossibility of thecooperation of two systems.
He, Stalin, had said that in a capitalist environment there existed the danger of an attack on the U.
S.
S.
R.
.
If one of the parts did not want to cooperate, that signified that ·the danger of an attack exis.
ted.
And, in fact,.
Germany did not want to cooper-ate ~ith the U.
S.
S.
R.
, and had attcked-the U.

Had the U.

R.
had been able to cooperatt;! with Germany, but the Ger-mans had not •wanted this.
Otherwise the U.
S.
-:).
R.
· would have cooperated with Germany as they-had with other countries.
" As you see, the wish for cooperation existed, but not the pos-sibility.
.
, .
One ·must distinguish between the possibil-ity of cooperation and the wish · to cooperate.
The possibility of cooperation is always there, but the .
wish to cooperate is not always there.
If one part does not · :want to cooperate, it re-sults in conflict, in war .
.
" Stassen declared that the wish must be present on both sides.
Stalin replied that he wanted to attest to the fact that Russia had the wish to cooperate.
Stassen said that he was pleased to hear that, and that he would like to go into Stalin's declaration about the similarity of the economic systems of the United States of America and Germany.
He must say that the economic sys-tems of the United States of America and Ger-many had been different from one another when it was Germany that began the war.
Stalin was not in agreement with that and explained that there was a difference between the regimes of the United States of America and Germany, but no difference between the ec-onomic systems.
The regime is transient, a po-litical factor.
Stassen said that many articles had been written saying that the capitalist system had produced the menace of monopolies, imperialism and the oppression of the workers.
In his, Stas-sen' s, opinton, the United States of America had succeeded in preventing the development of the monopolist and imperialist tendencies of cap-italism, had led to prosperity and through this the w· ,,·ker:s in the United States of America had a larger say in many matters than Marx and Engels had thought possible.
Therein lay the difference between the economic system of the United States of America and the economic sys-tem that existed in Hitler's Germany.
Stalin said that one must not allow oneself to be carried away by the criticism of the sys-tem of the other.
Every people holds firmly to the system that it wants.
History will show which system is bl i.
er.
One must respect the system that the people choose and approve.
Whether the system in the United States of Am-erica is bad or good is a matter for the Ameri-c111 people.
For cooperation, it is not necessary fut the peoples to have the same system.
One must respect the system approved by the people.
Only on these terms is cooperation pos-sible.
Concerning Marx.
and Engels, they of course, could not predict what would happen for-ty years after their deaths.
_ .
The Soviet system was called a totalitarian or a dictatorship system.
, but the Soviet people call the· American system monopoly capitalism: If the two sides begin to insult each other as monopolist or totalitarian they would hot come·· to cooperation.
One m'ust take note of the his-torical fact that there exist two systems which have been approved by the people.
Only on this basis .
is cooperation possible.
Where the passion for the criticism of monopolism and .
.
totalitarianism was concerned, it was propaganda, -bu't he, Stalin, was not a propagandist, -rather a man of.
deeds.
We m_ay not be sectarian, Stalin said.
If the people wish · to change a system, they will do so.
As he, Stal-in, had met ·Roosevelt and discussed military questions, he and Roosevelt had .
not insulted each other as monopolists and totalitarianists.
They had.
considered it· more essential that he and Roosevelt had established cooperation with one another and had.
cichieved victory over the enemy.
Stassen said that this manner of criticism of both sides had been one of the causes of the misunderstandings that had arisen since the end of the war.
He, Stassen, wished to know wheth-er Stalin hoped in the future to raise to a high-er degree the exchange of ideas, students, teach-ers, actors and tourists, if cooperation was .
es-tablished between the U.
S.
S.
R.
and the United States of America.
Stalin answered that it was inevitable, if cooperation was established.
The exchange of goods led to the exchange of people.
Stassen said that in the past there had been misunderstandings between the U.
S.
S.
R.
and the United States of America, that the Soviet side did not wish to exchange ideas, as was seen in the introduction of censorship of reports sent out by foreign reporters from Moscow.
So tlwt in the circumstances, that the newspaper "New York Herald Tribune" was refused permis-sion to have a reporter of their own in Moscow, that this mistake was one of the causes· of the mutual misunderstandings between the peoples of the U.
S.
S.
R.
and the United States of Amer-ica.
Stalin answered that the case of the re-fusal of a visa for a correspondent of the "New York Herald Tribune" had, as a matter of fact, happened.
That this misunderstanding, however, was an accidental phenomenon and had no re-lation to the politics of the Soviet government.
He, Stalin, knew that the "New York Herald Tri-bune" was a respectable newspaper.
In this re-spect, it was of great significance that so~e Arn erican correspondents were unfavourably dis-posed towards the U.
S.
S.
R.
Stassen answered that it was a fact that there were such reporters.
The reporter of the "New York Herald Tribune" was given permissio11 to stoy in Moscow, however, only for the ~u­ ration of the session of the Council of foreignMinisters.
Now this newspaper posed the quest-ion of sending a permanent reporter to Moscow.
The "New York Herald Tribune" was a leading organ of the Republicans, that was gaining more importance now that the Republicans had gaine~ a majority in Congress.
,Stalin answered: "That its of no importance.
.
to us, we see no great difference between the Republicans and the Democrats.
" Concerning the question of the reporte~s, he, Stalin, remember-ed an incident.
·In Tehran, the three great pow-ers ·held a conference in which they worked efficiently and in a .
friendly atmosphere.
An American reporter whose name he could not re-member at the moment, had sent a report that Marshal Timoshenko was present at the Tehran Conference, although in reality · he was not there, and th.
at he, Stalin, had violently .
attack-ed Timoshenko during-the dinner.
But that was a big and slanderous lie.
And now? Should one praise such a reporter? At that dinner, where the participants celebrated Churchill's sixty-ninth birthday, he Churchill, Brook, Leahy and others were present, in total about thirty people could attest that no such thing had taken place.
Nevertheless this reporter had sent his false report to the newspaper, and it was pub-lished in the press of the United States of Am-erica.
"Can one trust such a reporter? We," said Stalin, "are not of the opinion that the United :States of America or its politicians are to blame for this.
Such incidents do happen.
Thnt caused bad feelings amdng the Soviet people.
" Stassen said thal cases of irrespu .
.
.
,1!J!e re-porters.
sending false reports did happen, but other reporters corrected the mistake of the first, and after a while the people knew which reporters they could trust and which they couh~ ·not.
Stalin ·answered that this was correct.
Stassen said that any time a reporter gave an intentional and obviously false report, his pa-per would recall him, and thus our newspapers would create a team o.
f honest and capable re-porters.
Stalin said that these reporters write only sensational news which newspapers will publish to earn money and then dismiss these reporters afterwards.
Stassen said that in the spheres of the press, trade and.
culture, the two systems must finds ways and means to build up good relations with one another.
Stalin said that he was right.
Stassen declared that he believed that if the reports of reporters did not undergo censor-ship, this would be a better basis for coop-eration and mutual understanding between our people and each other.
Stalin said in the U.
S.
S.
R.
it would be dif-ficult to do away with censorship.
Molotov had tried more than once, but had been unable to do away with it.
Each time the Soviet govern-ment had tried to do without censorship they had regretted it and had re-introduced it.
In the autumn of the prP"inus year they had done·.
away with c.
ensorship.
He, Stalin, had been on holiday and the reporters had begun to write that Molotov had forced Stalin to go on holiday, and then they wrote that Stalin, on returning, would drive.
out Molotov.
Thereby these repor~­ ers had presented the Soviet government to some extent ·as a wild animal house.
Of course, the Soviet people were indignant about this and· thus, censorship had to be re-introduced.
Stassen said that he now understood that Stalin held cooperation to be possible if the wish and the intention to cooperate existed.
.
Stalin answered that he was completely 'JH.
' .
· Stassen said that 'for the raising of living standards.
the mechanization and electrification was of great importance, and the.
applica_tion of atomic energy in industry was of great import-ance for alt the peoples as well as .
for the peoples of the U.
S.
S.
R.
and the United S~a~es.
of America.
He, Stassen, was of the opmwn that the creating of an inspection and cont~ol system and that the, use of atomic _energy for military purposes sh9uJd be declared illegal, was of great importance for all t~e.
peoples ?f the world.
Was Stalin of the opmwn that m the future, they should come to terms over the co~­ trol and regulation of the production of atomic energy and over its peaceful application? Stalin answered that he hoped so.
Between t.
he U.
S.
S.
R.
and the United States of America there stood great differences of opinion on this question, but finally both sides, -so he, Stalin, hoped, -would come to terms.
In his, Stalin's, view there would need to be international con-trol arid inspection and this would be of great importance.
The application of atomic energy for peaceful purposes would cause a great revo-1u tion in production procedure.
Where the ap-plication of atomic energy for military purposes was concerned, it possibly would be forbidden.
The desires and the conscience of the peoples demanded so.
Stassen unswerec.
J that it wus one of the 111ost importw1t problems.
If it was solved, atom-ic energy could be a great blessing for the peoples of all the worlc.
J, but i I not, then a great curse.
Stalin said that he believed · it would be possible to establish international control and in-speuion.
The development moved towards that.
Stassen thanked Stalin for the interview.
Stalin answered that he was at Stassen's disposal and that the Russians respected their guests.
Stassen said that during the San Francisco Conference he had had an unofficial talk with Molot~v.
In the course of this conversation he kid been invited to visit Russia.
Stalin said that he believed the situation i11 Europe was very bad now.
What did Mr.
Stas-:,e11 think about it? Stassen answered that this was right in general, -that some countries had not suffered so much from the war and were not in such a difficult position, for example Czechoslovakiaand Switzerland.
Stalin said that Switzerland and Czecho-slovakia were small countries.
Stassen answered that the large countries found themselves in a very difficult situation.
The· problems they were facing were of a· fi-nancial, raw materials and nutritional n~ture.
'Stalin explained that Europe was a part of · the world in which there were many factories and works, but where there was a perceptible lack of raw materials and food.
That was tragic.
·Stassen thought that the poor level of the ')Utput of the coal production in the Ruhr area '<.
id led to a coal· shortage in Europe.
Stalin said that a coal shortage had also been fell in England and that this was most strange.
Stassen explained that the coal production in the United States of America fortunately stood at a high level.
In the United States of America, two million ·.
tons of bituminate coal was mined daily.
Consequently, the United States of America was in the position of being able to supply Europe with large amounts of coal.
Stalin declared that the situation was not so bad in the United States of America.
Amer-ica was protected by two' oceans.
On the north-ern border of the United States of America was the weak country of Canada, and in the south the weak country of Mexico.
The United Stales of America did not need to be afraid of them.
After the War of Independence the people had not been involved in war for sixty years and !tad enjoyed peace.
All that had contributed to the swift development of the United States of America.
In addition, the population of the United States of America consisted of people tlwt had liberated themselves long ago from the yuke of kings and land aristocracy.
All these circumstances had also favoured the rapid de-velopment of the United States of America.
Stassen declared that his great-grandfather had fled from Czechoslovakia because of im-perialism.
Of course, the geographical situation of the United States of America was a great help.
"We are lucky," said Stassen, "that the en-emy was defeated far away from our coasts.
The United States of America was in the po-sition to adapt itself completely, and after the war to resurrect production in great volume.
Now the task is to avoid a depression and ec-onomic crisis.
" Stalin asked if an economic' crisis was ex-pected in the United States of America.
Stassen answered that no economic crisis was expected.
He believed that it was possible to regulate capitalism in the United States of America to raise the level of employment to ' .
.
.
a high standard and to avoid any serious cns1s.
The main task lay, however, in avoiding a crisis in Lhe eco11omic system of the United St<Jtt's of America.
But if the government followed a wise.
IHJiicy and if one took account of the lessons ot the years 1929-30, there would be establ1~hed regulated capitalism and not monopoly capital-ism in the United States of America, which would help to avoid a crisis.
Stalin said that to achieve this a very strong government would be needed, which was also Jnspired by great determination.
.
Stassen said that he was right, besides which the people must understand the measures, that· 'the stabili.
zing apd preservation of the ec.
.
'.
.
onomic system is aimed ·at.
That is a new task ! or which there is no parallel in any economic vstem of the world.
.
.
Stalin dedared that there were favourable ircumstances for the United States of America, .
1t the· two rivals of the United States of Am-dca in the world market -Japan and Germany, !lad been removed.
Consequently, the demand for American goods .
had increased· and that had created favourable conditions for the develop-ment of the United States of America.
The mar-kets of China .
and Japan were open to the United States of America, like Europe.
This would he.
Ip the United ·States of America.
Such favourable conditions had never before existed.
Stassen said that on the other hand no means of payment existed in these markets, so that it would be a burden and not a profitable business for the United States of America.
But of course the removal of Germany and Japan, two carriers of the imperialist danger, was a great blessing for the United States of America and for the other countries from the point of view of peace.
EarCier, world trade had, of course, not been a factor of great importance for the United States of America.
Their market had been confined to the area of the United States · of America or the western hemisphere.
Stalin said that before the war about 10% of American produce was exported to other countries.
As far as purchasing power was con-cerned, he, Stalin, believed the merchants would find a means of payment, so as to buy Ameri-can goods and sell them to the peasants of these countries.
Tlw merchants in China, Japan, Lurope and South .
l\merica had saved money.
Now the United States of America will probably ruise its exports to 20%.
Was that correct? Stassen said thut he did not believe so.
Stalm asked: "Seriously?" Stassen answered in the affirmative and said that if the .
United States of Americu's ex-ports increased to 15% they would be lucky, in his opinion.
Most of the merchants had saved money in their country's currency, which was all tied up and not suitable for transfer.
Thus, in Stassen's opinion, the exports of the United States of America would not exceed 15%.
Stalin thought that if one considered the lt'.
Vel of production i11 the United States of Am-('rica, then 15% was no small figure.
Stassen agreed with that.
Stalin declared that American industry, it was said, had many orders.
Wa':!> that correct? It was said that the works of the United States of America were not in the position of being able to fulfil all these orders, and that all works were functioning at 100%.
Was that cor-rect? Stassen answered.
that that was correct, but that they handled the inland orders.
Stalin remarked that that was very import-ant.
Stassen said that they succeeded in mee.
t-ing the demanq for food, women's clothing and shoe's; the production of machinery, ·motor ve-hicles and locomotives was still lagging behind.
Stalin said that reports had appeared in the American, .
press that an economic crisis would soon occur.
Stassen said tha.
t the press had reported 1that the unemploymeqt figure in the United States of America would.
rise to eight million in November of last year: This· report, however, had been false.
The task therein was to raise ·production t<? a high level and to increase stabil-ization, and so avoid an economic crisis.
Stalin remarked that Stassen obvious-ly had the regulation 6f production in mind.
Stassen answered that that was right and explained that there were people in America who asserted that there would be a depression.
But he, Stassen, was optimistic and believed and maintained that the Americans could avoid a depression; he, Stassen, knew that the people had a deeper understanding of stronger regula-tion than earlier.
Stalin asked: "And the business people? Would they understand, allow such regulation · and submit to restrictions?" Stassen said that the business people would such et rult ·.
St<.
din remarkcJ tlwt of course they would oppose it.
Stassen thought that they lwd, however, understood that the depression of 1929 must not repeal itself, and they could now :-;ee better the necessity of regulation.
Of course, to be a far-reaching regulation, the government would need to make many decisions and to proceed sensibly.
Stalin remarked that he was right.
· Stassen declared that it was necessary for :tll systems a11d forms of gover11111e11t.
Under any l llrrn of government i l was bad for the people 1I they made mistakes.
Stulin agreed to that.
Stussen suid t!Jat J upun und Germany hue! proved this to be correct.
Stalin said that i11 these countries the econ-omy hud been under the control ol the milit<try, which did not understand economy •.
So, in .
I apun, 1, 11 example, the economy was led by Toto, who only knew how to conduct war.
Stassen said that that was right.
He thank-ed Stalin for giving him the possibility of speak-ing to him and for the time Stalin had spared him.
Stalin asked how long Stassen meant to :;tay 111 the U.
S.
S.
R.
Stassen answered that he would be going tu Kiev the next clay.
Upon that he wanted to c·xpre.
ss his admirntion for the heroic defenders or Stalingrad and he thought after that, to leave the U.
S.
S.
R.
by way of Leningrad.
During "Ji!H>St'the defence of Stalingrad he had been with the American fleet in the Pacific, where he had fol-lowed the Epopee of Stalingrad with anxious at-tention.
Stalin said that Admiral Niemitz was clear:-ly a very important marine commander.
Stalin asked, whethe'r .
Stassen had been to _Leningrad .
.
yet.
Stassen said that he had not yet been to Leningrad and had the intention of leaving the U.
S.
S.
R.
by way .
of Leningrad.
·Stalin said that the talk with Stassen had >("iven him much.
.
Stassen said that ~he talk with Stalin had also been very useful to him for his work in the study of economic problems.
Stalin said that he had also ·been occupied very much with economic problems before the war and only· through the compulsion of neces-sity was he a military.
specialist.
Stassen asked whether he could get and keep the.
protocol of th.
e interview from Pavlov and whether he had permission to speak to re-porters about the int<:!r:view if he came together with one.
Stalin said that of course Stassen could keep the protocol and talk to reporters about it, -there was nothing secret about it.

SSAGL TO f\lOSCOW o Sc,!'i 1·11.
:.
' ? / I'!.
;/ Greetings to Moscow, the capital of our country, on its 800th anll!versary.
The entire country is today celebrating Lhis significant day.
It is celebrating it not for-mally, but with feelings of Jove and reverence, because of the great services Moscow has ren-dt'red our country.
The services which Moscow has rendered ;1rc not only that it thrice in the course of the lw,tury of our cow1try liberated her from for-t·ig11 oppression -from the Mongolian yoke, from Polish-Lithuanian invasion and from French incur-c.
ion.
The service Moscow rendered is primarily that it became the basis for uniting disunited Russia into a single state, with a single govern-ment and a single leadership.
No country in the world can count on preserving its independence, on real economic and cultural growth, if it has not succeeded in liberating itself from feudal disunity and strife among princes.
Only a count-ry which is united in a single centralized state can count on the possibility of real cultural and economic growth, on the possibility of firmly establishing its independence.
The historic ser-vice which Moscow rendered is that it has been and remains the basis and the initiator in the creation of a centralized state in Russia.
But this is not the only service that Mos-cow has rendered our country.
After Moscow, bythe will of our great Lenin, was again proclaim-the capial of our country, it.
became the banner bearer of the new, Soviet epoch.
Moscow is today not only the inspirer in the building· of the new, Soviet social and econ-omic o'rder, which substituted the rule of· La-bour for the rule of capital and rejected the exploitation of ·man by man.
Moscow fs also the herald of the movement for the liberation of toiling mankind from capitalist slavery.
Moscow is.
today not only the inspirer in the .
building ;of the new, Soviet democracy, which rejects all, direct or indirect, inequality of citizens, sexes, races and nations, and en-sures the right to work and the right to equal pay· for equal work.
Moscow is also the banner of the struggle which all the wmking people in the world, all the oppressed races and nations, are waging to liberate themselves from the rule ·of plutocracy and imperialism.
There can be no doubt that without this policy Moscow could not have bec;ome the centre of organization of the friendship of nations and of their fraternal co-operation in our multi-)lational state.
Moscow is today not only the initiator in the building of the new way of life of the work-ing people of the capital, a life free from want and wretchedness suffered by millions of poor and unemployed.
Moscow is also a model for all the capitals in the world in this respect.
One of the gravest sores of the large capitals of countries in Europe, Asia and America are the slums in which millions of impoverished working ~d 1wople are doomed to wretchedness and a slow etnd painful death.
The service which Moscow has rendered is that it completely abolished t f1ese slums and gave the working people the op-portunity to move out of their cellars and hov-els into the apartments and houses of the bour-geo1s1e and into the new com for table houses which have been built by the Soviet authorities.
Lastly, the service Moscow renders is that it is the herald of the struggle for durable peace and friendship among the nations, the her-ald of the struggle against the incendiaries of a new war.
For the imperialists, war is the most profitable undertaking.
It· is not surprising that the agents of imperialism are trying, in one way or another, to provoke a new war.
The service which Moscow renders is that it un-ceasingly exposes the incendiaries of a new war <rnd rallies around the banner of peace all the peace-loving nations.
It is common knowledge that the peace-loving nations look with hope to Moscow as the capital of the great peace-loving power and as a mighty bulwark of peace.
It is because of these services that our country is today celebrating the 800th annivers-ary of Moscow with such love and reverence for her capital.
Long live our mighty, beloved, Soviet, So-cialist Moscow! ].

President! As you ~now, two out of three of the countries bordering the U.
S.
S.
R.
, that stood on the side of Germany against the U.
S.
S.
R.
during the war, namely Hungpry and Rumania, have signed a support treaty against an eventual Ger-man aggression with the U.
S.
S.
R.
· As is also known, our two countries stood together strongly in sympathy throughout this aggression, in· which we, together with you, bear the responsibility before our peoples if we allow the repetition of such an aggression.
I am of the opinion that a support treaty with the U.
S.
S.
R.
, against an eventual German aggression is of no less interest for Finland than for Rumania and Hungary.
.
Out of these considerations and from the wish to create better relations between our countries for the strengthening of peace and security, the Soviet government offers the con-clusion of a Soviet-Finnish Friendship, Coop-eration and Support Treaty like the Hungarian-Soviet and Rumanian-Soviet treaties.
Should there be no objections from the l·'innish side, would propose that a Finnish del-egation be sent to tile U.
S.
S.
R.
Lu conclude such d treaty.
Should it be 111ore convenient for you to carry through the negotiations and the con-clusion of the treaty in Finland, the Soviet gov-ernment offers to send their delegation to Hel-sinki.
Yours respectfully, j.

rz.
if1 191,8 I would like to say a few words about Ll1e significance of the Treaty of friendship ~nd Mutual Help between the Soviet Union and fm-land, which was signed yesterday.
.
This treaty sig111fies a change rn the re-lations between our countries.
As it is known, in the course of 150 years uf relations between Russia and Finland there has been mutual dis-trust.
The Finns distrusted the Russians, the Russians distrusted the Finns.
From the Soviet side there resulted an attempt in the past tobreak the distrust.
that stood between the Rus-sians and the Finns.
That was at the time that Lenin, in 1917, proclaimed the independence of Finland.
From an historical point of view, that was an outstanding act.
.
But sadly the distrust was not· thereby broken -the distrust stayed distrust.
The -result was two wars between us.
I would like us to go over from · the long · · period of mutual distrust in·.
the course of which we went to war with each other twice, to a new period in 01:1r relations: the period of mu-tual t.
rust.
· It is necessary that the conclusion of this treaty breaks this.
distrust and builds a new ba-sis for relations between our peoples and that it signifies a great change in the relations be-tween our countries towards trust: and friend-.
ship.
We want this acknowledged not only by those present in this hall, but also by those out-side this hall, as much· ·in Finland as in the So-viet Uniori.
.
.
One ·must not believe that the distrust be-tween our peoples can .
be removed all at once.
That is not done so quickly.
For a long time there will be remnants of this distrust, for the abolition of which one must work and struggle hard, and to build and strengthen a tradition of mutual friendship between the U.
S.
S.
R.
and Fin-land.
· There are treaties that are based upoll equality and some that are not.
The Soviet-Finnish treaty is a · treaty that is based upon equality, it has been concluded on the basis of full equality of the partners.
Many believe that between a big and little nation there cannot be relations which are based on equality.
But we Soviet people are of the opinion that such relations can and should exist.
We Soviet people are of the opinion that every nation, great or small, has special qual-ities that only they have and no other nation possesses.
These peculiarities are their contri-bution, that every nation should contribute, to the common treasure of the culture of the world.
In ~his sense, all nations, big and small, are in the same situation, and every nation is as equally important as the next nation.
.
.
So the Soviet people are of the opm10n that Finland, although a small country,.
is i~ ~his treaty, as equal a partner as the Soviet Umon • You do not find many politicians of the great powers that would regard 1 • e .
small na-tions as the equals of the larger rwtions.
Most of them look down upon the small nations.
They are not disinclined, occasionally, to make a one-sided guarantee for a small nation.
These po_li-ticians do not, in general, conclude treaties which depend on equality, with small nations, as they do not regard small nations as their part-ners.
propose a toast to the Soviet-Finnish treaty, and to the change for the better in the relations between our countries that this treaty signifies.
1 ("Pravda," 13 April, 1948) 165ANSWER TO THE OPEN LETTER OF HENRY WALLACE 17 flay, 1948 believe that among the political docu~ ments of recent times, that have the_ strength-ening of peace," the .
furthering of international' · cooperation and the securing of democracy as their aims, the open letter of Henry Wallace the presidential ~andidate of the ·Third Party i~ the U.
S.
A.
, is the most important.
The open letter of Wallace cannot be re~ garded as a mere exposition of the wish to im-prove the international · situation, as an expo-sition of the wish for a peaceful settlement of the differences of opinion between the Soviet Union and the U.
S.
A.
, and the wish to find a way towards such a settlement.
The declaration of the government of the U.
S.
A.
of 4 May, and the answer of the Sovi~t.
government of 9 May are, therefore, insufficient, because they do not go so far as to declare that the settlement of the Soviet-American .
differences of opinion is desirable.
The great importance of the open letter lies in the fact that it is not limited just to that, to giving a declaration, but rather exceeds that, -a more important step, an advance, -and proposes a concrete programme for the peaceful settlement of the differences of opin-ion between the Soviet Union and the U.
S.
A.
One cannot say that the open letter of Wallace invariably deals with all the differences.
One also cannot say that none of the formulas and opinions in the open letter m•ed to be im-proved.
But that is not the important thing at the moment.
The important thing is that Wal-lace, in his letter, makes an open and honest attempt to work ouL a peaceful programme for a peaceful settleme11t and gives concrete pro-posals on all the p1iints of difference between the Soviet Uniori anJ the U.
S.
A.
These proposals are generally known: General limitation of armaments and the forbidding of atomic weapons.
Conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and Japan and the withdrawal of the troops from these countries.
Withdrawal of the troops from China and Korea.
Consideration for the right of nations to self-determination a11d non-interference in their internal affairs.
Forbidding the building of· military bases in the countries thut belong to the United Na-: t ions.
Development of international trade in ev-ery area, with the elimination of all discrimin-ation.
Help and rebuilding within the framework of the United Nations for countries that suffer-ed from the war.
Defence of democracy and the securing of civil rights in all countries, etc.
One can be for or against these proposals; but no statesman that has anything to do withthe matter o·f peace and cooperation of nations can ignore this programme, which reflects the hopes and longing of the peoples for the strengthening of peace, and which, without doubt, will .
find the s4pport of millions of the common people.
· I do not know wheth~r the government of the U.
S.
A.
acknowledges the programme of Wal.
.
:· lace as a basis for understanding between the U.
S.
S.
R.

Vi, 1948 Q.
How do )ou evaluate the results of the · · discussion of the Secu'rity Council on the sit-uation in Berlin and the stand of the English-American and French representatives in this affair7 A.
I evaluate it as an expression · of the aggressive politics, of the English-American and f rench government circles: Q.
Is •it true that in August of this year there was already an agreement reached by the .
four powers on the question of Berlin? A.
· Yes, it is true.
As it is known, ·on 30 A4gust of this year, in Moscow, an agreement was reached between the representatives of the U.
S.
S.
R.
, the U.
S.
A.
, England and France, that planned simultaneous steps to repeal the limit-ation of traffic on o.
ne.
hand, and the decision to introduce the German Mark of the Soviet zone in Berlin as the only currency, on the other hand.
· This agreement did not violate the interests of anyone; it considered the interests of the partners and guaranteed the possibility of further cooperation.
But the governments of the U.
S.
A.
and England over-ruled their represent-atives in Moscow and declared this agreement invalid, that is, they .
violated it by the decision to hand the question to the Security Council, where.
the Anglo-Americans had a irnre mnJority.
Q.
Is it true th<tl recently in !'aris, during 1 Ile discussion of tlw question in the Security ( ·ouncil, an agre<:111efll on the situation 111 Berlin 1\dS reached in ur1t1fficial conversations, even be-1 (Jrc the Sccuri t y Council h<Jd discussed this question? A.
Yes, it is true.
Tile Argentirnan rep-resentative, Mr.
· Brumiglia, who also functions as the Chair·: .
.
' of the Securil,\ Council, and who negotiated with Vyshinsky unofficially in the name of other interested powers, had in his hands a joint draft for the solution of the prob-lems of the situation in Berlin.
The represent-<.
Hives of the U.
S.
A.
and En.
1 u, however, again declared this agreement invalid.
Q.
What is ·happening here? Can you not explain it? A.
What is happening is that the inspirers of the aggressive l" 1 itics of the U.
S.
A.
and Eng-land are not int <'t.
cd in agreement and coop-eration with the U.
S.
S.
R.
They do not need an agreement or cooperation, but talk about agree-111ent and cooperation and after they have broken the agreement, they shift the blame on-to the U.
S.
S.
R.
, and thereby "prove" that coop-eration with the U.
S.
S.
R.
is impossible.
The wur-mongers that strive to unleash a new war ~re afraid above all of agreement and cooperation with the U.
S.
S.
R.
, of political agreement with the U.
S.
S.
R.
, as it undermines the position of the warmongers and renders the aggressivepolitics of these gentlemen· obsolete.
Therefore they even break agreements that already exist, overrule their representatives that have worked out these agreements jointly with the U.
S.
S.
R.
, and convey the question, in vio-lation of the Statutes of the United Nations or.
.
: ganization, to· the Security Council, where they have '8 sure maJority at their disposal and where·· they all can "prove" ·everything they like.
All this is done to "prove" that cooperation with the U.
S.
S.
R.
is impossible, to ''prove" that a new war is necessary, and therefore create the cond~tions for the unleashing of war.
The polit.
:.
ics of the present.
leaders of the U.
S.
A.
and Eng-land are the politics of· aggression and politics for the unleashing of a new war.
· Q.
And how are the negotiations of the representatives of the six states in the Sec-urity Cquncil,· China, Canada, Belgium, Argent-ina, Columbia and Syri~, evaluated? A.
It is clear that.
t.
hese gentlemen support the politi.
cs of aggression, the politics for the unleashing of a new war.
Q.
Where can all this end? A.
It can only end in an ignominious fiasco for the warmongers.
Churchill, the arch-arsonist of a new · war has already reached the point where he has lost the trust of his nation and the democratic powers of the whole world.
The same fate awaits all the other warmongers.
The horrors of the last war still live in the minds of the peoples, and the powers that intercede for peace are so great that the supporters of Churchill's aggression cannot overcome them and lead them in the direction of a new war.

S.
R.
be prepared to consider a joint .

-Q.
Would you, your Excellency, be pre-pared to meet President Truman at some accept-able place to discuss the possibility of con-cluding such a peace trea'ty? A.
I have already said earlier that there are no objections to such a meeting.
("Pravda," 31 January, 1949) ANSWER TO KINGSBURY SMITH To Mr.
Kingsbury Smith, European General Director of the "Int("rnational News Service" Agency.
I have received your telegram of l Feb-.
ruary.
I thank President Truman for the invitation to Washington.
It has long been my wish to travel to Washington, as I formerly said to Pres-ident Roosevelt in Yalta and to President Tru-man in Potsdam.
Sadly, I do not have the pos-sibility of realizing my wish at present, as the doctor has decided against my making a long journey, especialty by sea or air.
The government of the Soviet Union would greet a visit from the President 'to the U.
S.
S.
R.
One could hold a conference in Moscow, Lenin-grad or in Kaliningrad, Odessa or Yalta, which-ever t hv President chooses, -of course, in so far as it presents no inconvenience.
However, if this proposal meets with ob-jections, one could hold a meeting in Poland or in Czechoslovakia, at the President's conven-ience.

Dear Mr.
Minister President, The Soviet government has examined the request of the government of the German Demo-cr~tic Republic on the reduction of the repar-ation sum to be paid by Germany.
The Soviet government has, at the same time, borne in mind that the German Demo-cratic Republic has been conscientious and reg-ular rn their ful f ilnH·11t of their reparation oblig-ation, which is charged as high as 10 billwn dol-lars, and that by tile end of 1950 an important part of r his obligation, as much as 3658 million dollars, will have been realized.
.
Led by the wish to ease the efforts of the German people in the reconstruction and develop-ment of the people's economy in Germany, and bearing in mind the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet government has decided, with the agreement of the government of the I 'olish Republic, to reduce the remaining sum of tile reparation bill by 50'Y.

CONCERNING ISM IN LINGUISTICS J.
STALIN ("New Germany," Berlin Ed.
, No.
125, 2 June, 1950) A group of younger comrndes have asked me to give my opinion in the press on problems.
relating to linguistics, particularly in reference to Marxism in tinguistics.
I am not a linguistic expert and, of course, cannot fu!ly satisfy the request of the comrades.
As to Marxism in lin-guistics, as in other social sciences, this is some-thing directly in my field.
l have therefore con-sented to answer a number of questions put by the comrades.
Q.
Is it true that language is a superstruc-ture on the basis? A.
No, it is not true.
The basis is the economic structure of soc-iety at the given stage of its development.
The superstructure is the political, legal, religious, artistic, philosophical views of society and the political, legal and other institutions correspond-ing to them.
Every basis has its own corresponding su-perstructure.
The basis of the feudal system has its superstructure, its political, legal and other views, and the corresponding institutions; the ca-pitalist basis has its own superstructure, so has the socialist basis.
lf the basis changes or is el-1minatecl, then, following this, its superstructure changes or is eliminated; if a new basis arises,then, following this, a superstructure arises cor-responding to it.
In this respect language radically differs from the superstructure.
Take, for example, Rus-sian society" and the Russian language.
In the co-urse of the past thirty years the old, capitalist basis.
_ has been.
eliminated in Russia and a new, socialist basis has been built.
Correspondingly,· the superstructure on the capitalist basis has be-en eliminated and a new superstructure created corresponding .
to the socialist basis.
The old po-litical, legal and other institutions, consequently, have been supplanted .
by new, socialist institut-ions.
But in spite of this the Russian language has remained basically what it was before the October Revolution.
What has changed in the Russian language in .
this perioc:I? To a certain extent the vocab-ulary of the Russian "language has changed, in the sense that it has been replenished with a· considerable number of new words and express-ions, which have arisen in connection with the rise of the new socialist production, the appear-ance of a new state; a new socialist culture, new social relations and morals, and, lastly, in con-nection with the development of technology and science; a number of words and expressions have changed their meaning, have acquired a new sig-nification; a number of obsolete words have dr-opped out of the vocabulary.
As to the basic st-ock of words and the grammatical system of the Russian language, which constitute the foundat-ion of a language, they, after the elimination of the capitalist basis, far from having been elimin-ated and supplanted by a new basic word stock and a new grammatical system of the language, have been preserved in their entirety and have not undergone any serious changes -they have .
been preserved precisely as the foundation of the modern Russian language.
Further, the superstructure is a product of the basis, but this by no means implies that it merely reflects the basis, that it is passive, neu-tral, indifferent to the fate of its basis, to the fate of the classes, to the character of the sys-tem.
On the contrary, having come into being, it becomes an an exceedingly active forPe, ac-tively assisting its basis to take shape an Li ,c·on-solidate itself, and doing its utmost to help the new system to finish off and eliminate the old basis and the old classes.
It cannot be otherwise.
The superstructure is created by the basis precisely in order to ser-ve it, to actively help it to take shape and con-solidate itself, to actively fight for the elimina-tion of the old, moribund basis together with its old superstructure.
The superstructure has only to renounce this role of auxiliary, it has only to pass from a position of active defence of its ba-sis to one of indifference towards it, to adopt CJn equal attitude to all classes, and it loses its virtue and ceases to be a superstructure.
In this respect language radically differ~; from the superstructure.
Language is not a pr<.
JL.
uct of une or another basis, old or new, within the given society, but of the whole course ofthe hisory of the society and of the history of the bases for many centuries.
It was created not by some one class, but by the entire soc-iety, by all the classes of the society, by the efforts of hundreds of generations.
It was creat-ed for the satisfaction of the needs not of ·one particular class, but of the entire society, of all Ghe dasses of the socjety.
Precisely.
for this rea-· · son.
it was created as a single language for the society, common to all members of that society, as the common language of the whole people.
Hence the functional role of language, as a means of intercourse between people, consists not in serving one class to the detriment of oth-er classes, but in equally serving the entire so-ciety, all the classes of society.
· This in fact ex-plains why a language may equally serve both t·he old, moribund system and the new, rising sy-stem; both the old basis and the new basis; both the exploiters and the.
exploited.
.
It is no secret to anyone that the Russian language· served Russian capitalism and Russian bourgeois culture before.
the October Revolution just as well.
~s it now serves the socialist sys-tem and socrnhst culture of Russian society.
The same must be said of the Ukrainian Byelorussi~n, Uzbek, Kazakh, Georgian, Armen~ ian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Moldavian, Ta-tar, Azerbaijanian, Bashkirian, Turkmenian and other languages of the Soviet nations; they ser-ved the old, bourgeois system of these nations just as well as they serve the new, socialist sys-tem.
It cannot be otherwise.
Language exists, la-nguage has been created precisely in order to serve society as a whole, as a mr~ans of inter-course between people, in order to be common to the members of society and constitute the single language of society, serving mern be rs of society equally, irrespective of their class sta-tus.
A language has only to depart from this po-sition of being .
a languuge common to the whole people, it has only to give preference and sup-port to some one social group to the detriment of other social groups of the society, and it lo-ses its virtue, ceuscs to be ;_1 mt·<ms or interco-urse between t!1t· pt't>pie of tile :;ociet\, ancl be-t:ornc:-; the 1;1rg<)11 •11 ,,<>rn<· ,;(J«J:il group, d1·w·ner-C1tes u11cJ is duu11wd t11 d1sL1pp1·.

:\ lcrngudgc t!lt·r1·fore lives im-· !l1Pasurabl\· lunger t lwn any basis or superstruct-ure.
This in fact explains why the rise and elim-ination not only of one basis and its superstruct-ure, but of several bases and their corresponding superstructures, have not led in history to the elimination of a given language, to the elimin:-ation of its s~ructure and the rise of a new lan-guag~ with a new stock of words and a.
new gra-.
.
mmatical system.
It is more than a hundred years since Push-kin died.
In this period the feudal system and the capitalist system were eliminated in Russia, and a third, a socialist system has arisen.
Hence two bases, with their superstructures, were elim-inated, and a new, sqcialist basis has arisen, with its new superstructure.
Yet, if we take the Russian language, for example, ft has not in this long span of time undergone any fundamental change, and t.
he modern_ Russian language differs very little in structure from the language of Pushkin.
What has changed.
in the Russian language in this period? The Russian vocabulary has in this period been greatly replenished;a large num-ber of obsolete words · have dropped out of the vocabulary; the meaning of a great many words has changed; the grammatical system of the lan-guage has improved.
As.
to the structure of Push-kin's language, with its grammatical system and its basic stock of words, in all essentials it has remained as the basis of modern Russian.
And this is quite understandable.
Indeed, what necessity is there, after every revolution, for the existing structure of the language, its grammatical system and basic stock of words to l>L· destroyed and supplanted by new ones, as is usu a 1ly the case w i l h the superstructure?What 1ilijccL woulJ there lw in callillg "water," "earth," "111uu11tdin," "forest," "fish," "man," "to walk," "to do," "to produce," "to trade," etc.
, not wa-ler, earth, mountain, etc.
, but something else? What object would there be in having the mod-ification of words in a language and the com-bination of words in sentences follow not the ex-isting grammar, but some entirely different gra-mmar? What would the revolution gain from such an upheaval in language? History in general never does anything.
of any importance without some special necessity for it.
What, one asks, can be the necessity for such a linguistic revo-lution, if it has been demonstrated that the existing language and its structure are funda-mentally quite suited to the needs of the new system? The old superstructure can and should be destroyed and replaced by a hew one in the course of a few years, in order to give free scope for the development of the productive forces of society; but how can an existing lan-guage be destroyed and a new one built in its place in the course of a few years ·without causing anarchy in social life and without cr-eating the threat of the disintegration of so·-ciety? Who but a Don Quixote could set himself such a task? Lastly, one other radical distinction be-t ween the superstructure and language.
The su-perstructure is not directly connected with pro-quction, with.
man's productive activity.
It is connected with production only indirectly, th-rough the economy, through the basis.
The super-structure therefore reflects changes in the level of development of the productive forces not im-mediately and not directly, but only after chan:.
ges in the basis, through the prism of the chan-ges wrought in 'the basis by the changes in pro-· · duction.
This means that the sphere of action of the superstructure is narrow and limited.
Language, on the contrary; is connected with.
man's prdductive activity directly, and not only with man's productive activity, but with all his other activity in all his spheres of work, from production to the basis, and from the basis to the superstructure.
For this.
reason language reflects changes in production immediately and directly, without waiting for changes in the ba-sis.
For this reason the sphere of action of lan-guage, which embraces all fields of man's ac-tivity, is far broader · and more comprehensive than the· sphere of actfori of the superstructure.
More, it is practically unlimited.
It is this that .
p~imarily explains why lan-guage, or rather its vocabulary, is in a state of almost constant change.
The continuous de-velopment of industry and agriculture, of trade and transport, of technology and science, de-mands that language should replenish its vocab-ulary with new words and expressions needed for their functioning.
And language, directly reflect-ing these needs, does replenish its vocabulary with new words, and perfects its grammatical system.
Hence: a) A Marxist cannot regard language as a superstructure on the basis.
b) To confuse language and superstructure is to commit a serious error.
Q.
ls it true that language ;_ilways was and is class language, that there is no.
such thing as language which is the single and common lan-guage of a society, a non-class language com-mon to the whole people? A.
No, it is not true.
It is not difficult to understand that in a society which has no classes the:e can be no such thing as a class language.
1 here were no classes in the primitive communal clan system, and consequently there could be no class lan-guage -the language wm; then the sin.
gle and common language of the whole community.
The objection that the concept class sh~uld ~e ta~en dS covering every human commumty, including tlw primitive commu1wl community, is .
not an ob-iectiun but a playi11g with words that IS not wor-th refuting.
As to the subsequent development from clan languages to tribal languages.
.
fr~m tribal languages to the languages of nat1onal1t1es,.
and from the languages of nationalities to national languages -everywhere and at all sta?es of de-velopment, language as a means of Intercourse between the people of a society, was the com-mon and single language of that society, serving its members equally, irespective of their social 203status.
I am not ref erring here to the empires of the slave and mediaeval periods, the empires of Cyrus or Alexander the Great, let us say, or of Caesar or Charles the Great, which had no econ-omic foundations of their own and were trans-ient and unstable military and administrative~ <is-sociations.
Not ·only did these empires· not have; they could not have had u single language com-mon to the whole empire and under~;tood by all the members of the empire.
They were conglom-erations of tribes and nationalities, each of which lived its own life and had its own lan-guage.
Consequetitly, it is not these or similar empires I have in mind', but the tribes and ·na-tionalities composing them, which had their own economic foundations and their own languages, evolv~d in the distant past.
History tells us that the languages of these tribes and nationalities were not class languages,· but languages common .
to the whole of a tribe or nationality, and un-derstood _by all its people.
Side by side with this, there were, of course, dialects, loc<;1l vernaculars, but they were dominated by and subordinated to the sing-le and common language of the tribe or nation-ality.
Later, with the appearance of capitalism, the elimination of feudal division and the for-mation of national markets, nationalities develop-ed into nations, and the .
languages of nation-alities into national languages.
History shows that national languages are not class, but com-languages, common to all the members of <·;ich nation and constituting the single language or th<ll 11atiu11.
lt has been said above that language, as a means of intercourse between the people of a society, serves all classes of society equally, and in this respect displays what may be called an indifference to classes.
But people, the va-rious social groups, the classes, are far from be-ing indifferent to language.
They strive to util-ize the language in their own interests, to im-pose their own special lingo, their own special terms, their own special expressions upon it.
The· upper strata of the propertied classes, who have divorced themselves from and detest the people -the aristocratic nobility, the upper st-rata of the bourgeoisie -particularly distinguish themselves in this respect.
"Class" dialects, jar-gons, high-society "languages" are created.
These dialects and jargons are often incorrectly re-ferred to in literature as languagt'S -the "aristo-cratic language" or the "bourgeois language" in contradistinction to the "prolet<1rian la'nguage" or the "peasant language.
" for this reason, strange as it may seem, some.
of our comrades have come to the conclusion that national lc:rn-guage is a fiction, and that only class languages exist in reality.
There is nothing, I think, more erroneous than this conclusion.
Can these dialects and jar-gons be regarded as languages? Certainly not.
They cannot, firstly, because ·these dialects and jargons have no grammatical systems or basic 111011word stocks of their own -they borrow them from the ·national language.
They cannot, second-ly, because these dialects and jargons are con-fined to a narrow sphere, are current only among the upper strata of a given class and are.
entirely unsuitable as a means of human inter-course for society as a whole.
What, t~en, have they? 'They have· a copection of specific words reflecting the specific tastes of the aristocracy ,;r the upper strata of the bourgeoisie; a certain number of expressions and turns of phrase dis-tinguished by refinement and gallantry and free 0f the "coarse" expressions and turns of phrase of the national language; lastly, a certain num-ber of foreign words.
But all the fundamentals, that is, the overwhelming majority of the words and the grammatical system, are borrowed from ·the common, national language.
Dialects and jar-gons are therefore off-shoots of the common national language, devbid of all linguistic in-dependence and doomed.
t.
o stagnation.
To be-lieve that dialects and jargons can develop into independent languages capable of ousting and supplanting the national language means losing one's sense of historical perspective and abandon-ing the Marxist position.
References are made to Marx, and the pas-sage from his article "St.
Max" is quoted which says that the bourgeois "their own language," that this language "is a product of the bour-geoisie," that it is permeated with the spirit of mercantilism and huckstering.
Certain comrades cite this passage with the idea of proving that Marx believed in the "class character" of lan-guage and denied the existence of a single na-tional ·language.
If these comrades were im-partial, they should have cited another passage from this same article "St.
Max," where Marx, .
touching on the ways single national languages arose, speaks of "the concentration of dialects into.
a single national language resulting from ec-onomic and political concentration.
" Marx, consequently, did recognize the ne-cessity of a single national language, as a high-er form, to which dialects, as lower forms, are subordinate.
What, then, can this bourgeois language be which Marx says "is a product of of the bour-geoisie"? Did Marx consider it as much a lan-guage as the national language, with a specific linguistic structure of its own? Could he have considered it such a language? Of course not.
Marx merely wanted to say that the bourgeois had polluted the single national 'language with their hucksters' lingo, that the bourgeois, in other words, have their hucksters' jargon.
It thus appears that these comrades have misrepresented Marx.
And they misrepresented him because they quoted Marx not like Marxists but like dogmatists, without delving into the es-sence of the matter.
References are made to Engels, and the words from his "The Condition of the Working-Class in England" nre cited where he says that in Britain " .
.
.
the working-class has gradually be-come a race wholly apart from the English bour-207geoisie," that "the workers speak other dial<~cls, have other thoughts and ideals, other customs and moral principles, a different religion and other politics than those of the bourgeoisie.
" Certain comrades conclude from this passag~ that Engels denied the necessity of a common national language, that he believed, cqnsequent-!y, in the "class character" of language.
True,'· :::ngels speaks here of dialects, not lang~ages, fully realizing that, being an offshoot of the language, a dialect cannot supplant the 1ational national language.
But apparently these com-rades regard the existence of a difference be-tween a language and •a .
dialect with no particul-ar enthusiasm.
It is obvious that the quotation is inappro-priate, because Engels speaks here· not of .
"class languages" but chiefly of class thoughts, ideals, customs, moral principles, religion, politics.
It is perfectly true that the thoughts, ideals, cus-toms, moral principles,.
religion and politics of bourgeois and proletarians are directly anti-thetical.
But what has this to do with national language, or the "class character" o.
f lan~uage? Can the existence of class antagonisms in so-ciety serve as an argument in favour of the "class character" of language, or cigai nst t lte ne-cessity of a single national l<_111guagl~? Mdrxisrn says that a common language is 011c ot ttw ('ar-dinal ear-marks of a nation, alt hough k 11< 1\\ 111g very well that there are class ant~1g<Hiis111s w1ti1 in the nation.
Do the comrades rt'll rred to re-cognize this Marxist thesis? References are made to Lafargue, and it is said that in his pamphlet "The French Lan-gauge ·Before and After the Revolution" he re-cognizes the "class character" of.
languuge and denies the necessity of a national language com-mon to the whole people.
That is not true.
La-fargue does indeed speak of a "noble" or "aristo· cratic language" and of the "jargons" of various strata of society.
But these comrades forget that Lafargue, ·who was not interested in the difference between languages and jargons and re-ferred to dialects now as "artificial languages," now as "jargons," definitely says in this pamph-let that "the artificial language which disting-uished the aristocracy .
.
.
arose out of the lan-guage common to the whole people, which was spoken both by bourgeois and artisan, by town and country.
" Consequently, Lafargue recognizes the ex-istence and necessity of a common language of the whole people, and fully realizes that the "aristocratic language" and other dialects and jargons are subordinate to and dependent on the language common to the whole people.
It follows that the reference to Laf argue is wide of the mark.
References are made to the fact that at one time in England the feudal lords spoke "for centuries" in f rench, while the English people spoke English, and this is alleged to be an ar-gument in favour of the "class character" of language and against the necessity of a language common to the whole people.
But this is not anargument, it ls rather.
an anecdote.
firstly, not all the feudal lords spoke French at that time, but only a small upper stratum of English feudal lords attached to the court and at county seats.
Secondly, it.
was not some "class language" they spoke, but the ordinary language common to.
all the French people.
Thirdly, we know that in the course of time· this French language· fad dis-·· appeared without a tiace, yielding place to the English language common to the whole people.
Do these comrades think that the English feudal lords.
"for centuries" held intercourse with the English people through interpreters, that they did not use the {:nglish language, that there was no language common to' all the English at that time, and that the French language in England was · then anything more than the language of high society, current only in the restricted ;rcle of the upper English aristocracy? How .
1n one possibly deny the existence and the ne-cessity of a language common to the whole people o_n the basis of anecdotic "arguments" like these? There was a time when Russian aristocrats dt the tsar's court' and in high society also • 1 ade a fad of the French language.
They prided mselvc·s on the fact that when they spoke ::rn they often lapsed into French, that they ·uld only speak Russian with a French .
accent.
1ues this mean that there was no Russrnn lan-r•1:,ge common to the whole people at that time ·" Russia, that a language common to the whole people was a fiction, and "class languages" a reality? Our comrades are here committing at least two mistakes.
The first mistake is that they confuse lan-guage with superstructure.
They think that since the superstructure has a class character, lan-guage too must be a class language, and not a language c.
ommon to the , whole people.
' But I have already said that language aQd super-structure are .
two different concepts, and that a Marxist must not confuse them.
The second mistake of these comrades is that they conceive the opposition of interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the fierce class struggle between them, as meaning the disintegration of society, as a break of all ties between the hostHe classes.
They believe that, since society has disintegrated and there is no longer a single society, but only classes, a single language of society, a national language, is unnecessary.
If society has drsintegrated and there is no longer a language common to the whole people, a national language, what re-mains? There remain classes and "class lan-guages.
" Naturally, every "class language" will have its "class" grammar -a "proletarian" gram-mar or a "bourgeois" grammar.
True, such gram-mars do not exist anywhere.
But that does not worry these comrades: they believe that such grammars will appear in due course.
At one time there were "Marxists" in our country who asserted that the railways left to us after the October Revolution were bourgeoisrailways, that it n11ld be unseemly for us Marx-.
sts to use thl :18t they should be torn up and new, "proletarian" railways built.
For this they were nicknamed "troglodytes" .
.
.
.
It goes· without saying that such a primit-ive-anarchist view of society, of classes, of Ian.
:.
guage has notning in common with Marxism.
But it undoubtedly exists i,lnd continues to 'prevail in·· the minds of certain of our muddled comrades.
It is of course wrong to say that, because of .
the existence.
of a fierce class struggle, so-ciety· has split 'up into classes which are no long-er economically connected with one another in one society.
On the contrary, as long as capital-ism exists, the bourgeois and the proletarians will be bound together by every economic thre-ad as parts of a single ca pi ta list: society.
The bourgeois cunnot live •and enrich themselves un-less they have wage-labourers ut their command; the proletarians canno.
t survive unless they hire themselves to the .
cap.
italists.
If all economic ties between them were to cease, it would ·riean the cessation of all production, and the ssation of all production would mean the doom of society, the doom of the classes them-selves.
Naturally, no class wants to incur self-destruction.
Consequently, however sharp the class struggle may be, it cannot lead to the dis-integration of society.
Only ignorance of rv1arx-ism ancl complete failur·e to unck:rstctnd tlH'.
na-ture of language could lwve suggl"Skd tu so111t· of our comrades, the fuiry-tale ~dJout tl1,: d I:"> integration of society, about "cL1~;s" Lu11·.

•'·"'· and "class" grammars.
Reference is further made to Lenin, and it is pointed out that Lenin recognized the ex-istence of two cultures under capitalism -bour-geo.
is and proletarian -and that the slogan of national culture under capitalism is a national-ist slogan.
All this is true and Lenin is absolute-ly right here.
But what has this to do with the "class character" of language? When these com-rades ref er to what Lenin said about two cul-~ures under capitalism, it is evide.
ntly with the idea.
of suggesting to the reader that the exist-ence ~f two cultures, bourgeois and proletarian, In society means that there must also be two languages, inasmuch as language is linked with culture -and, consequently, that Lenin denies the necessity of a single national language, and, con.
sequently, that Lenin believes in "class" lan-guages.
The mistake these comrades make here ts that they identify and confuse language with culture.
!Jut culture and language ·are two differ-ent things.
Culture may be bourgeois or social-ist, but l<.
.
inguage, as a means of intercourse, is ~1lways a language common to the whole people and can serve both bourgeois and socialist cul-ture.
ls it not a fact that the Russian, the Uk-rainian, the Uzbek languages are now serving socialist culture of these nations just as well as they served their bourgeois cultures before the October Revolution? Consequently, these com-rades are profoundly mistaken when they assert that the existence of two different cultures leads to the formation of two different lan-guages and to the negation of the necessity of a single language.
When Lenin spoke of two cultures, he pro-ceeded precisely from the thesis thut the exist-ence of two cultures cannot lead· to the neg-ation of a single language and to the formation of two lunguages, that there must be a sing It:.
language.
When the ·Bundists accused Lenin or de'1ying the necessity of a national language and of regarding culture as "non-national," Lenin, as we know, vigorously protested and declared that he was fighting against bourgeois culture, and not against national langw:.
1ges, the necessity of which he regarded as indisputable.
It is strange that some of our comrades should be trailing in the footsteps of the Bundists.
As to a single language, the necessity of ~hich.
Lenin .
is alleged to deny, it would be we 11 to pay !leed to the following words of Lenin: .
"Language is the.
most important me.
ans ot human intercourse.
Unity of language and its un-.
impeded· development form one of the most im-portant conditions for genuinely free and extens-ive commercial intercourse appropriate to mod-ern capitalism, for a free and broad grouping of the population in all its seperate classes.
" It follows that our highly respected com-rades have misrepresented the views of Lenin.
Reference, lastly, is made to Stalin.
The passage from Stalin is quo~ed ~hich s~ys thut "the bourgeoisie and its nat10nallst parties w.
ere and remain in this period the chief dtrecllng for-ce of such nations.
" This is all true.
The bour-geo1s1e and its nationalist party really do direct bourgeois culture, just as the proletariat and its internationalist party direct proletarian culture.
But what has this to do with the "class char-acter" of language? Do not these comrades know that national language is a form of nation-al culture, that a national language may serve both bourgeois and socialist culture? Are our comrades unaware of the well-known formula of the Marxists that the present Russian, Ukrain-ian, Byelorussian and other cultures are socialist in content and national in form, i.
e.
, in lan-guage? Do they agree with this Marxist for-mula? The mistake our comrades commit here is that they do not see the difference between cul-ture and language, and do not understand that culture changes in content w.
ith every new pe-riod in the development of society, whereas lan-guage remains basically the same through a num-ber of periods, equally serving both the new cul-ture and the old .
Hence: a) Language, as a means of intercourse, al-ways was and remains the single language of a society, common to all its members; .
b) The existence of dialects and jar guns does not negate but confirms the existence of a language common to the whole of the given people, of which they are off shoots and to which they are subordinate; c) The "class character" of language fof'-rnula is erroneous and non-Marxist.
Q.
What are the characteristic features of cr1guage? A.
Language is one of those social pheno-nena which operate throughout the existence of a society.
It· arises a11d develops with the rise.
and deveiopment of society.
It dies when the so-ciety dies.
Apart from society there is_ no lan-guage.
Accordingly, language and its laws of de-velop men~ can be understood only if studied in inseperablc connection with the history of so-ciety, with the.
history of the people to whom the language under study belongs, and who are 'ts creators and repositories.
Lunguagc is a medium, an instrument with .
1e help of which people' communicate with one another,.
exchange thoughts and understand each other.
Being directly connected with thinking, '.
anguage registers and fixes in words, um! in \\''irds combine·d into sentencvs, the results of the process of thinking and achi<~vements nf man's cognitive activity, and thus 111<1kes pos-sible the exchange of thoughts in ilurn.
111 society.
Exchange of thoughts is a constLlnt and vi-tal necessity, for without it, it is impossible to co-ordinate the joint actions of people in the struggle against the forces of nature, .
in the struggle to produce the necessary material val-ues; without it, it is impossible to ensure the success of society's productive activity, and, hence, the very existence of social production becomes impossible.
Consequently, without a lan-z1;cige understood by.
a society and common to ··.
ti its members, that society must cease to pro-duce, must disintegrate and cease to exist as· a society.
In this sense, language, while it is a me-dium of intercourse, is at the same time an in-strument of struggle and development of so-ciety.
As we know, alt the words in a language taken together constitute what is known as its vocabulary.
The chief thing in the vocabulary of a language is its basic stock of words, which in-cludes also all ·the root words, as its kernel.
It is far less extensive than the language's vocab-ulary, but it persists ·for for a very long time, for centuries, and provides the language with a basis for the formation of new words.
The vo-cabulary reflects the state of the language: the richer and more diversified the vocabulary, the richer and more developed the language.
However, by itself, the vocabulary does not constitute the language -it is rather the building material of the language.
Just as in con-struction work the building materials do not con-stitute the building, although the latter cannot be constructed without them, so too the vocab-ulary of a language does not constitute the lan-guage itself, although no language is conceivable without it.
But the vocabulary of a language as-sumes tremendous importance when it comes un-der the control of grammar, which defines the rules governing the modification of words and the combination of words into sentences, and thus makes the language a coherent and signif-icant function.
Grammar (morphology, syntax) is the collection of rules governing the modifica-tion of words· and their combination into senten-ces.
It is therefore thanks to grammar that it becomes possible for language to invest man's thoughts in a material linguistic integument.
The distinguishing .
feature of grammar is that it gives rules for the modification of words not in reference to concrete words, but to words 'in general, not.
taken concretely; that it·· .
;ives rules for the formation of sentences not '1 reference to particular concrete sentences -.
.
v ith, let us say.
a concrete subject, a concrete predicate, etc.
·-but to all sentences in general, •respective of the concrete form of any sen:_ 'nee in-particular.
Hence, abstracting itself, as ,~ards both words and sentences, from the p.
.
ir-,\_,ular and concrete, gram mar takes that which is common and basic in the modification of words and their combination into sentences and builds it into grammatical rules, grammatical laws.
Grammar is .
the.
outcome of a process of abstraction performed by.
the human mind o;, L:r a long p~riod of time; it is an indic<tLion of the tremendous achievement of thought.
In this respect .
grammar resembles geo-metry, which in giving its laws abstracts itself from concrete objects, regarding objects as bod-ies devoid of concreteness, and defining the re-lations between them not as the concrete re-lations of concrete objects but as the relations of bodies in general, devoid of all concreteness.
Unlike the superstructure, which is connect-ed with production no't directly, but through the economy, language is directly connected with man's productive act1v1ty, as well as with all his other activity in all his spheres of work without exception.
That is why the vocabulary of a language, being the most sensitive to chan-ge, is in a state of almost· constant change, and, unlike the superstructure, language does not have to wait until the basis is eliminated, but makes changes in its vocabulary before the basis is eliminated and irrespective of the state of the basis.
However, the vocabulary of a language does not change in the way the superstructure does, that is, by abolishing the old and building something new, but by replenishing the existing vocabulary with new words which arise with changes in the social system, with the develop-ment of production, of culture, science, etc.
Moreover, although a certain number of obsolete words usually drop out of the vocabulary of a language, a far larger stock of new words are added.
As to thv ba-;ic word stock, it is preserv-ed in all its fundamentals and is used as the ba-sis for the vocabulary of the language.
This is quite understandable.
There is no necessity to destroy the basic word stock when it can be effectively used through the course of several historical periods; not to speak of the fact that, it being impossible to create a new basic word stock in a short time, the destruct-ion of the basic word stock accumulated in the course of centuries would result in paralysis of the language, in the complete disruption of in-tercourse between people.
219The grammatical system of a language changes even more slowly than its basic word stock.
Elaborated in the course of epochs, anJ having become part of the flesh and blood of the language, the grammatical system changes still more slowly than the basic word stock.
With the lapse of time it, of course, undergoes changes, becomes more .
perfected, im.
proves its· rules, makes them more specific and acquires _new rules; but the fundamentals of the gram-matical system .
are preserved for a very long time, since, as history shows, they are able to serve society effectively through a succession of epochs.
Hence, grammatica'l system and basic word stock constitute the foundation ·of language, the essence of its specific character.
History shows that languages possess great stability and ·a tremendous power of resistance to forcible assimilation.
Some historians, instead of explaining this phenomenon, confine them-selves tQ expressing t'heir surprise at it.
But there is no reason for surprise whatsoever.
Lan-guages owe their s.
tability to the stability of their grammatical systems and basic word st-u'--l~s.
The Turkish assimilators strove for hund-reds of years to mutilate, shatter and destroy the languages of the Balkan peoples.
During this period the vocabulary of the Balkan languages underwent considerable change; quite a few Turk-ish words and expres'sions were absorbed; there were "convergencies" and "divergencies.
" Never-theless, the Balkan languages held their own and survived.
Why? Because their grammatical sys-tems and basic word stocks were in the main preserved.
.
It follows from all this that a language, 1ts structure, cannot be regarded as the product '.
)f some one_ epoch.
The structure of a language, Its grammatical system and basic word stock, is the product of a number of epochs.
We may assume that the rudiments of mod-ern language already existed in hoary antiquity, before the epoch of slavery.
It was a rather simple language with a very meagre stock of words, but with a grammatical system of its own -true, a primitive one, but a grammatical· system nonetheless.
The further development of production, the appearance of classes, the introduction of writ-ing, the rise of the state, which needed a more or less well-regulated corresponrlence for its ad-ministration, the development of trade, which needed a well-regulated correspondence still more, the appearance of the printing press, the development of literature -all this caused big changes in the development of language.
During this time, tribes and nationalities broke up and scattered, intermingled and intercrossed; later there arose national languages and states, revo-lutions took place, and old social systems were replaced by new ones.
All this caused even greater changes in language and its develop-ment.
However, it would be a profound mistake to think that language developed in the way thesi!perstructure · developed -by .
th.
e destruction .
of that which existed and the building of somethmg new.
In point of fact, languages did not develop by the destruction of existing langua.
ges and the .
:reation of new ones, but by extending and per-fecting "the basic elements of existing languages.
And the transition of the language from one quality to another diq not .
take the form of arr· explosion, of the destruction at one blow of the ')\d and the creation of the new, but of the "adual and long-continued accumulation of the ·nents of the new quality, of the new linguist-ic structure, and the gradual dying away of the elements of the old quality.
· It is said that tlie theory that languages develop by stages is a Marxist-theory, s.
i nee it recognizes the necessity of sudden exp:us1ons as a condition for the transition of a language from an old ·quality a new.
This is of course untrue for it is difficult to find ;in 'lr1g re-rmbli~g Marxism in~ .

Lafargue was wrong when he e of a "sudden 1 inguistic revolution which place between 1789 and 1794" in I ranee .
; Lafargue's pamphlet "The French Language sefore and After the Revolution").
There was no linguistic revolution, let alone a sudden one, in France at that time.
True enough, during that period the vocabulary of the French language was replenished with new words and expressions, a certain number of obsolete words dropped out of it, and the meaning of certain words changed -but that was all.
Changes of this nature, how-· ever, by no means determine the destiny of a language.
The chief thing in a language is its grammatical system and basic word stock.
But far from disappearing in the period of the Fren-ch bourgeois revolution, the grammatical system and basic word stock of the French language were preserved without substantial change, and not only were they preserved, but they continue to exist in the French language of today.
I need hardly say that five or six years is a ridiculous-ly small period for the elimination of an exist-ing language and the building of a new national language ("a sudden linguistic revolution"!) -cen-turies are needed for this.
Marxism holds that the transition of a lan-guage from an old quality to a new does not take place by means of an explosion, of the de-struction of an existing language and the cre-ation of a new one, but by the gradual ac-cumulation of the elements of the new quality, and hence by the gradual dying away of the el-ements of the old quality .
It should be said in general for the benefit of comrades who have an infatuation for ex-plosions that the law of transition from an old quality to a new by means of an explosion is inapplicable not only to the history of the de-velopment of languages; it is fl()l Ldways ap-plicable to other social phenomena · ol a basis or superstructural character.
It applies of necessity to a society divided into hostile classes.
But it does not necessarily apply to a society whic~ has no hostile classes.
In a period of eight· to ten years we· effected a transition in .
the agri-culture of our country from the bourgeois, in-·· dividual-peasant system to the socialist, collect-ive-farm system.
This was a revolution which eliminated the old bourgeois economic system in the countryside and created a new, socialis.
t vstem.
But that revolution did not take place IJ.
y means of an explosiqn, that is, by the over-throw of the existing government power and the creation of a new power, but by a gradual trans-ition from the old bourgeois system in the countryside to a new system.
And it was pos-sible to do ·that because it was a revolution from above, because .
.
the revolution was ac-complished on the initiative of the existing po-wer with.
the support of the.
bulk of the peasant-ry.
It is said that.
the numerous instances of linguistic crossing in past history furnish reason to believe that when languages cross a new Ian-guage is formed by means of an explosion, by a sudden transition from an old quality to a new.
This is quite wrong.
Linguistic crossing cannot be regarded as the single impact of a decisive blow which pro-duces its results within a few years.
Linguistic crossing is a prolonged process which continues for hundreds of years.
There can therefore be no question of explosion here.
Further, it would be quite wrong to think that the crossing of, say, two languages results in a new, third language which does not re-semble either of the languages crossed and dif-fers qualitatively from both of them.
As a mat-ter of fact one of the languages usually emerg-es victorious from the cross, retains its gram-matical system and its basic word stock and con-tinues to develop in accordance with its inher-ent laws of · development, while the other lan-guage gradually loses its quality and gradually dies away.
Consequently, a cross does not result in some new, third language; one of the languages persists, retains its grammatical system and ba-sic word stock and is able to develop in ac-cordance with its inherent laws of development.
· True, in the process the vocabulary of the victorious language is somewhat.
enriched from the vanquished language, but this strengthens rather than weakens it.
Such was the case, for instance, with the Ru;:;sian language, with which, in the course of historical development, the languages of a num-ber of other peoples crossed and which always emerged the victor.
Of course, in the process the vocabulary of the Russian language was enlarged at the ex-pense of the vocabularies of the other languag-es, but far from weakening, this enriched and strengthened the Russian language.
225As to the specific national individuality of the Russian language, it_ did not suffer in the slightest, because the Russian language preserv-ed its grammatical sy~tem and basic wo:cl stock ind continued to advance and perfect itself If) dCCordance with its inherent laws of develop-ment.
There can be no doubt that the crossing theory has little or no value for Soviet linguist-ics.
If it is true that the chief task of linguist-ics is to study .
the inherent laws of language de-velopment, it has to be admitted that the cross~ ing theory does not even set itself this task, _let c.

which 1s LO science and men of science.
The slight· .
.
:st criticism of the state of affairs in Soviet linguistics, even the most timid attempt to criticise the so-called "new doctrine" in linguist-ics, was persecuted and suppressed by the lead-ing linguistic circles.
Valuable worke_rs and.
re-searchers in linguistics were dismissed from their posts or demoted for being critical of N.
Y.
Marr's heritage or expressing the slightest disapproval of his teachings.
Linguistic scholars were appointed to leading posts not on their merits, but because of their unqualified accept:.
.
ance of N.
Y.
Marr's theories.
It is generally recognized that no science can develop and flourish without a battle of .
opinions, without freedom of criticism.
But this generally recognized rule was ignored and flout-ed in the mo.
st unceremonious fashion.
There arose a close group of infallible leaders, who, having secured themselves against any possible criticism, became a law unto themselves and did whatever they pleased.
To give one example: the so-called "Baku Course" (lectures delivered by N.
Y.
Marr in Ba-ku), which the al!thor himself had rejected and forbidden to be republished, was republished nevertheless by order of this leading caste (Com-rade Meshchaninov calls them "disciples" of N.
Y.
Marr) and included without any reserv-ations in the list of text-books recommended to students.
This means that the students were de-ceived, a rejected "Course" being suggested to them as a sound text-book.
If I were not con-vinced of the integrity of Comrade Meshchanin-ov and the other linguistic leaders, I would say that such conduct is tantamount to sabotage.
How could this have happened? It happened because the Arakcheyev regime established in linguistics cultivates irresponsibility and en-courages such arbitrary actions.
The discussion has proved to be very use-ful first of all because it brought this Arakchey-ev regime into the light of day and smashed it to smithereens.
But the usefulnejis of the dhcu.
:;sion does not end there.
It not only smashed .
the old re-gime in· linguistics but also brough~ out the: in.
.
: credible confusion of ideas on cardtnal questions of linguistics which prevail~ among t?·e leadi.
ng · · circles in this branch of science.
Until the d1s-cussi0n began the "disciples" of N.
Y.
Marr kept silence and glo~sed over the unsatisfacto.
ry st~te of a ff airs in linguistics.
But when the discussion started silence became impossible, and they were compelled to expr~ss their opinions in the press.
And what did we find? It turned out that in N.
Y.
Murr's teachings there are a whole num-ber of defects, errors, ill-defined · µruble ms and · etchy propositions.

" ·Yet it must be said that, despite its serious shortcomings, the comparative-historical method is nevertheless better than N.
Y.
Marr's really idealistic four-element analysis, because the former gives a stimulus to work, to a study of languages, while the latter only gives a stimulus to loll in one's armchair and tell fortunes in the tea-cup of the celebrated four elements.
N.
Y.
Marr haughtily discountenanced every attempt to study groups (families) of languages on the grounds that it was a manifestation of the "linguistic prototype" theory.
Yet it cannot 229be denied that the linguistic affinity of nations like the Slav nations, say, is beyond question, and diat a study of the linguistic affinity of these nations might be of great value to linguist-ics in the study of the laws of language develop-ment.
The "linguistic prototype" theory, I need hardly say, has nothing to do with it.
.
.
.
To listen to N.
Y.
Marr, and especially to his "disciples," one might think that prior to N.

Marr then .
.
.
.
ts no such thing as the sci-ence of language, that the science of language appeared with the "new doctrine" of N.
Y.
Marr.
Marx and Engels were much more modest: they held that their·.
dialectical materialism was a product of the devel0pment of the sciences, including philosophy, in earlier p'eriods.
Thus the discussion was usefUI also because It brought t.
o light ideologic "l shortcomings in Soviet linguistics.
I think that the sooner our linguistics rids · itself of N.
Y.
Marr's errors, the sooner will it be possible to extricate it from its present crisis.
Elimination of· rhe Arakcheyev regime in linguistics, rejection of N.

rUkovu.
Comrade Krasheninnikova, I am answering your questions.
Q.
Your article convincingly shows that language is neither the basis nor the super-structure.
Would· it be right to regard language as a phenomenon characteristic of both the ba-sis and the superstructure, or would it be more correct to regard language as an · intermediate phenomenon? A.
Of course, characteristic of language as a social phenomenon, is that common feature which is inherent in all social phenomena, in-cluding the basis and the superstructure, namely: it serves society just as society is served by all other social phenomena, including the basis and the superstructure.
But ·this, properly speaking, exhausts that common feature which is inherent in all social phenomena.
Beyond this, important distinctions begin between social phenomena.
The point is that social phenomena have, in addition to this common feature, their own specific features which distinguish them from each other and which are of primary importance for science.
The specific features of the basis consist in that it serves society economically.
The specific features of the superstructure con-sist in that it serves society by means of politi-cal, legal, aesthetic and other ideas and pro-vides society with corresponding political, legal and other institutions.
What the·· are the spe-cific features of language, distinguishing it from other social.
phenomena? They consbt in that lang.
,_,ge serves society as a means of inter-course between people, a:s a means for exchang-ing thoughts in· society, as a means o-f enabling.
.
cvple to understand· one another and to co-ordinate joint work in all spheres of human ac-~ iVity, both in the sphere of production and in ~11C' ~:phere of• economic relations, both in the re of politics and in the sphere of culture, i in social life and in every-day life.
These ccific features·· are characteristic only of lan-guuge, and precisely because they are character-istic only of language, language is the object of study by an independent science .
:.
linguistics.
If there were no such specific features of lan-guage, linguistics would lose its right to in-dependent existence.
In brief: language· cannot be included eith-er in the category of bases or in the category of superstructures.
Nor can it be· included in the category of "intermediate" phenomena between the basis and the superstructure, for such "intermediate" phenomena do not exist.
But perhaps language could b~~ included in the category of the productive forces of so-ciety, in the category, say, of insLruments of production? Indeed, there does exist a certain analogy between languages and instruments of just as language does, a kind of indifference to-wards classes and can serve equally different classes of society, both old and new.
Does this circumstance provide ground for including lan-guage in the category of instruments of product-ion? No, it does not.
.
At on ~ time, ~· Y.
Marr, seeing that his formula -1 language is a superstructure on th~ basis" -encountered objections, decided to "re-s hape II 1• t an d announced that "language is an in-~trum~nt of production.
" Was N.
Y.
Marr right in mcludmg language in the category of instru-ments of production? No, he certainly was not.
The point is that the similarity between la.
nguage and instruments of production ends with the analogy I have just mentioned.
But, on the other hand, ~here is a radical difference be-tween language and instruments of production.
This difference ·lies in the fact that whereas in-struments of production produce material weal-th, language produces nothing· or "produces" words only.
To put it more plainly, people pos-sessing instruments of production can produce material wealth, but those very same people, if they possess a language but not instruments of production, cannot produce material wealth.
It is not difficult to see that were language ca-pable of producing material wealth, wind-bags would be the richest men on earth.
Q.
Marx and Engels define language as "the immediate reality of thought," as "practic-al, .
.
.
actual consciousness.
" "Ideas," Marx says, "do not exist divorced from language.
" In what'Pasure, in your opinion, should linguistics oc-11py itself with the semantic aspect of lun-guc.
ige, semantics, historical semasiology and stylistics, or should form alone be the subject of lif1c'!listics? Semantics (semasiology) is one of· the iHij.
N• cclllt branches of linguistics.
The semantic aspect of words and expressions is ·of serious importance in the study of language.
Hence, stJ man tics (sem: :iology) !J1USt be assured its due place in lingui·iLiCs.
However, in working .
on pr• ! 'ems of se-mantics E>r• 1 in utilizing its data, its significance must in no way' be over-estimated, and still less must it be abused.
I have in mind certain philo-logists who, having an excessive passion fur se-mantics, disregard language as "the immediate reality of thought" inseparably connected with thinking, divorce thinking from language and maintain that language is outliving its age and that 1t is possible to do without language.
Listen to what N.
Y.
Marr says: "Lrnguage exists only inasmuch as it is ex-pressed in sounds; the action of thinking occurs also without being expressed .
.
.
.
Language (spoken) has already begun to surrender its functions to '.
!I' latest inventions which are unreservedly con-yuering space, while thinking is 011 the up-grade, departing from its unutilized accumulations in the past and its new acquisitions, and is to oust and fully replace language.
The language of the future is thinking which will be develupi11g in technique free of natural matter.
No language, 1 even the spoken language, which is all the same connected with the standards of nature, will be able to withstand it" (see "Selected Works" by N,Y.
Marr).
.
.
If w~ interpret this "labour-magic" gibber-ish mto simple human langu~ge, the conclusion may be drawn that: , a) N.
Y.
Marr divorces thinking from lan-guage; b) N.
Y.
Marr considers that communication between people can be realized without lan-guage, with the help .
of thinking itself which is , f ree o f t he " natural matter" of language, free of the "standards of .
nature"· · c) divorcing thinking from language and "having freed" it from the "natural matter" of language, N.
Y.
Marr lands into the swamp of idealism.
It is said· that thoughts arise in the mind of man prior to their being expressed in speech, that they arise without linguistic material, with-out linguistic integument, in, so to say, a naked form.
But that is absolutely wrong.
Whatever thoughts arise in the human mind and at what.
:.
ever moment, they can arise and exist only on the_ basis of the linguistic material, on ,.
.
.
the basis of language terms and phrases.
· Bare thoughts, free of the linguistic material free of.
the 11 "natural 1!1atter" ?f language, not exist.
Language is the immediate reality of thought".
(Marx).
The reality of thought is mani-feste~ ~n language.
Only idealists can speak of thmkmg not being connected with "the natur-.
doal matter" of language, of thinking without language.
· d Jn brief: over-estimation of semantics an abuse of it led N.
Y.
Marr to idealism.
.
Consequently, if semantics (semas10logy) i; saf eguar·ded against exaggerations and abuses 0 the kind committed by N.
Y.
Marr and some of his "disciples," semant_ics can be of great bene-·' fit to linguistics.
.
· Q.
You quite justly say that the ideas, con-cepts, customs and moral principl~s of the_ bour-geoisie and those of the proletan~t are directly antithetical.
The class character ot these phe110-mena is certainly reflected in the semantic as-pect of language (and sometimes in it~ form in the vocabulary -as is correctly pointed out in your article).
In analyzing concrete lin~uistic material and, in the first place, the semantic as-pect of language, can we speak of the class es-sence of the concepts expressed by languages, particularly in those ·cases when language e~­ presses not only the thought of n:an but al~?.
his attitude towards reality, where his class at t 1111ty manifests itself with .
especial clarity? A.
Putting it more briefly, you want to know whether classes influence language, whether they introduce into language their spe-cific words and expressions, whether there are cases when people attach a different meaning to one and the same word or expr~ssion depend-i'ng on their class affinity? .
Yes classes influence language, tntroducT into the 'language their own specific words and expressions and sometimes understand one and the ·same word or expression differently.
There is no doubt about that.
However, it does not follow that specific words and expressions, as well as difference in semantics, can be of serious importance for the development of a single language common to the· whole people, that they are capable of de-tracting from its significance or of changing its character.
Firstly, such specific words and express-ions, as well as cases of difference in semant-ics, are so few in language that they hardly make up even one per cent of the entire lin-guistic material.
Consequently, all the remaining overwhelming mass of words and expressions, as well as their semantics,.
are common to all classes of society.
Secondly, specific words and expressions with a class tinge are used in speech not accord-ing to rules of some sort of "class" grammar, which does not exist, but according to the gram-matical rules of the existing language common to the whole people.
Hence, the existence of specific words and expressions and the facts of differences in the semantics of language do not refute, but, on the contrary, confirm the existence and necessity of a single language common to the whole people.
Q.
In your article you quite correctly ap-praise Marr as a vulgarizer of Marxism.
Does this mean that the linguists, including us, the young linguists, should reject the whole l'inguist-237ic herit<11•,1· of Marr, who <.
ti! tlw S<t!llC l1;1s to his credit a number of valu~1llk l111guist1l· re--searches (Comrades Chikobavll, San/ileycv a11d others wrote about .
them during the discussion)? Approaching · Marr critically, cani1ot we take from him what is useful and valuable'? · A.
Of course, the works of N.
Y.
Marr do not consist solely of.
errors.
N.
Y.
Marr made'· very gross mistakes when he introduced into iin-guistics elements of Marxism in a distorted form, when h~ .
tried to create ·an independent theory of language.
But N.
Y.
Marr has certain good and ably written.
works, in which he, for-getting his theoretical.
claims, conscientiously and, one must say, skilfully investigates individ-ual languages.
In these works one can find not a little that is valuable and instructive.
Clearly, these valuable and instructive things should be taken from N~ Y.
Marr and utilized.
Q.
Many linguists consider formalism one of the main causes of.
the stagnation in Soviet linguistics.
We should very much like to know your opinion as to what formalism in linguistics :isists in and how it .
should be overcome? A.
N.
Y.
Marr and his· "disciples" accuse of "formalism" all linguists who do not accept the "new doctrine" of N.
Y.
Marr.
This of course is not serious or clever.
N.
Y.
Marr considered that grammar is an empty "formality," and that people who regard the grammatical system as the foundation of lan-guage ~,, c.
: formalists.
This is altogether foolish.
l think that "formalism" was invented by the.
authors of the "new doctrine" to facilitate ~heir struggle against their opponents in linguist-ics.
.
.
The .
cause of the stagnation in Soviet lin-gu1st1cs is not the "formalism" invented b .
N.
Y.
and his "disciples," but the ~v regime .
·and the theoretical gaps in linguist-ics.
The Arakcheyev regime was set up by th "d.
1sc1p · les" of N.
Y.
Marr.
Theoretical confusion e w_as brought into linguistics by N.
Y.
Marr and his .
closest colleagues.
To put an end to stag-~a~1on, both the one and the other must be el-1mmate~.
The removal of these plague spots will put Soviet linguistics on a sound basis, will lead It.
out on to the broad highway and enable So-~1et .
li~guistics to occupy first place in world lmgu1st1cs.

Dear Comrade Sanzheyev, I am replying to your letter with consider-able delay, for it was only yesterday forwarde.
d to me from the apparatus of the Central Com-mittee.
Your interpretation of my standpoint on· the question of dialects is absolutely correct.
"Class" dialects, which it would be more correct to call jargons, do not serve the mass of the people, but a narrow social upper crust.
Moreover, they do not have a grammatical sys-tem or basic word stock of their · wn.
In vie"": of this,· they cannot possibly de\ ·ip int 1 ·in-dependent langua.
ges.
Local ("territorial") dialects, on the other hand, serve the mass of the people and have a 'rammatical system and basic wr>rd stock of eir own.
In view of this, some l1;;___ ;_il dialects, n the process of formation of nat tons, may be.
,.
ame the basis of national languages and devel-'> into independent national languages.
This was ;e case, for instance, with the Kursk-Orel dia-ect (the · Kursk-Orel "speech") ·of the Russian language, which forme.
I the basis cil the Russian national langu::ige.
The same must be suid of the Poltava-Kiev dialect of the Ukrainian langu:1ge, which formed the basis of the Ukrninian rwLion-al language.
As for the other dialects of such languages; they lose their originality, merge with those languages and disappear in them.
Reverse processes also occur, when the single language of a nationality, which has not yet become a nation owing to the absence of the necessary economic conditions of develop-ment, collapses as a result of the disintegrution of the state of thLlt nationality, and the local dialects, which have not yet had ti1rn· to lw ful-ly uniformized in tl1e single language, rcviv(· ~111d give rise to the formation of sep~1rat1~ i11d1·1wr1cl-ent languages.
Possibly, this was the case, for example, with the single Mongolian language.

I have received your letters.
Your mistake is that you have confused two.
different things and substituted another sub-ject for that examined in my reply to Comrade Krasheninnikova.
I.
In that reply I criticized N.
Y.
Marr who, dealing with language (spoken) and thought, divorces language· from thought and thus lapses into idealism.
Therefore, I ref erred in my reply to normal human beings possessing the faculty of speech.
I maintained, moreover, that with such human beings thoughts can arise only on the basis of linguistic material, that bare th-oughts unconnected with linguistic material do not exist among people who possess the faculty of speech.
Instead of accepting or rejecting this thes-is, you introduce anomalous human beings, peo-ple without language, deaf-mutes, who have no language at their disposal and whose thoughts, of course, cannot arise on the basis of linguistic material.
As you see, this is an entirely differ-ent subject which I did not touch upon andcould not have touched upon, since linguistics concerns itself with normal human beings posses-sing the faculty of speech and not with anomal-ous deaf-mutes who do not possess the faculty of speech.
· You have substituted for the subject under discussion another subjec~ that was not discuss-.

From Comrade Belkin s letter It is ev1-.
dent that he places on a par the "language of ' e" words" (spoken.
language ) and " gesture 1anguag ("hand" .
language, according to N.
Y.
Marr).
He seems to think that gesture language and the language of woi'ds are.
of equal significance, that at one tii~•e human society had 11.
language of words that "hand" language at t time played th~ part of the language o'f wor<.
.
.
ls which appeared later:.
.
But if Comrade Belkin really thinks so, he is committing a serious error.
Spoken language or the language of words has always been the sole language of human society capable of serv-' '1!1; as an adequate means of intercourse.
be-, een people.
History 'does not know of a single Jman society, be it the most backward, that ,iid not have its own spoken language.
Ethno-graphy does not know of a single backward_ _tr-ibe, be it as primitive or even more _primitive than, say, the Australians or .
the .
Tierra del Fuegans of the last oentury, which did no~ have its own spoken language.
In the history ot man-kind spoken language has been one of the fo-rces' which helped human beings to emerge from the.
animal world, unite into communities, de-velop their faculty of thinking, organize social production, wage a successful struggle against the forces of nature and attain the stage of pro-gress we have today.
In this respect, the significance of the so-.
called gesture language, in view of its extreme poverty and limitations, is negligible.
Properly speaking, this is not a language, and not even .
a linguistic substitute that could in one way or another replace spoken language, but an auxil-iary means of extremely .
limited possibilities to which man .
sometimes resorts to emphasize this or that point in his speech.
Gesture language spoken language are just as incomparable as are the primitive wooden hoe and the modern cater-pillar tractor with its five furrow plough or tractor row drill.
3.
Apparently, you are primarily interested in the deaf-mutes, and only secondarily in prob-lems of linguistics.
Evidently, it ·was precisely this circumstance that prompted you to put a number of questions to me.
Well, if you insist, I am not averse to granting your request.
How do matters stand with regard to deaf-mutes? Do they possess the faculty of thinking? Do though-ts arise with them? Yes, they possess the fac-ulty of thinking and thoughts arise with them.
Clearly, since deaf-mutes are deprived of the faculty of speech, their thoughts cannot arise on the basis of linguistic materiaL Can this be ta-ken to mean that the thoughts of deaf-mutes are naked, are not connected with the "stand-243ards of nuture" (N.
Y.
Marr's expression)? No, it cannot.
The thoughts of deaf-mutes arise and can exist only on the basis of the images, sen-sations and conceptions they form in every-day life on the· objects of.
the outside world an? their relations among themselves, thanks to ·the senses of signt,.
of touch, taste and smell.
Apurt from these images, s.
en~ations and conceptions;· thought is empty, is deprived of all content, that is, it does not exist.

have received your letter.
Pressure of work has somewhat delayed my reply.
Your letter tacitly proceeds from two , .
.
.
,.
mises: from the premise that it is permissib-t~ to quote the work of this or that author apart from the historical period of which the quotation treats, and secondly, from the premise that this or that conclusion or formula of Marx-ism, derived as a result of studying one of the periods of historical development, holds good for all periods of development and therefore must rL~main invariabl~.
I must say that both these premises arc deeply mistaken.
A few examples.
1.
In the forties of the past century when there was no monopoly capitalism as yet, when capitalism was developing more or less smoothly along an ascending line, spreading to new ter-ritories it had not yet occupied, and the law of uneven development could not yet fully operate, Marx and Engels concluded that a socialist revo-lution could not be victorious in one particular country, that it ·could be victorious only as a re-sult of a joint blow in all, or in most, civilized countries.
This conclusion subsequently became a guiding principle for all Marxists.
However, at the beginning of the twentieth century, especially in the period of the first world war, when it' became clear to everyone that pre-monopoly capitalism had definitely de-veloped into monopoly capitalism, when rising capitalism· had ·become dying capitalism, when the war had revealed the incurable weaknesses of the world imperialist front, and the law of uneven development predetermined that the pro-letarian revolution would mature in different countries at different times, Lenin, proceeding from Marxist theory, came to the conclusion that in the new conditions of development, the socialist revolution could fully prove victorious in one country taken separately, that the simul-taneous victory of the socialist revolution in all countries, or in a majority of civilized count-ries, was impossible owing to the uneven ma-turing of the revolution in those countries, that the old formula of Marx and Engels no longercorresponded to the new historical conditions.
It is evident that here we have l WO <11 f re r-ent conclusions on the question of the v1Ltory of socialism, which not only contradict, but ex-clude each other.
.
Soine dogmatists and talmudists who quote mechanically wi~hout delving into the ~ssence of che matter, and apart.
from historical conditions;· may say that one of these conclusions should.
be discarded as being absolutely incorrect, while the other conclusion, as the absolutely correct one, .
should be' applied to all periods of develop-ment.
Marxists, however, cannot but know that the dogmatists , and talmudists are mistaken; they cannot but know 'that both of these con-clusions are correct, though not absolutely, each being correct for its own time: Marx's and En-gels' conclusion -for the period of pre-mono-poly capitalism; and Lenin's conclusion -·for the period of monopoly capitalism.
2.
Engels in his .
"Anti-Dohring" said that after the victory of the socialist revolution, the state is bound to wither away.
On these gr-ounds, after the victGry of the socialist revo-lution in our country, dogmatists and talmudists in our Party began demanding thut the Party should take steps to ensure the speedy withering away of our state, to disband state organs, to give up a standing army.
However, the study of the world situation of our time led Soviet Marxists to the con-clusion that in the conditions of capitalist en-circlement, when the socialist revolution has been victorious only in one country, and capital-ism reigns in all other countries, the land of the victorious revolution should not weaken, but in every way strengthen its state, state organs, intel.
ligence organs and army, if that land does .
not want to be crushed by· the capitalist en-circlement .
.
.
Russian Marxists came to the con-clusion that Engels' formula has in view the vic-tory of · socialism in all, or in most, countries, that it cannot be applied in the case where so-cialism is victorious in one country taken sep-arately and capitalism reigns in all the other countries.
Evidently, we have here two different for-mulas regarding the destiny of the socialist :-;tate, each formula excluding the other.
The dogmatists and talmudists may say that this circumstance creates an intolerable situation, that one of these formulas must be discarded as being absolutely erroneous, and the other -as the absolutely correct· one -must be applied to all periods of development of the so-cialist state.
Marxists, however, cannot but know that the dogmatists and talmudists are mis-taken, for both these formulas are correct, though not absolutely, each being correct for its time: the formula of Soviet Marxists -for the period of the victory of socialism in one or sev-eral countries; and the formula of Engels -for the period when the consecutive victory of so-cialism in separate countries will lead to the victory of socialism in the majority of countries and when the necessary conditions will thushave been cr~ated for the application of Engels'· formula.
The number of such examples could be multi plied.
.
The same must be said of the two d1ffe~-ent formulas on the question of language, taken from various '"w9rks of Stalin and cite<:! by Com-rade Kholopov in his letter.
.
· , Comrade Kholo: ·· refers to Stalin s work "Concerning Marxism ,, Linguistics," where the .
.
:iusion is drawn that, as a result of the cros-!ig; say, of two languages, one of the~ usuaUy ~merges victorious, while the oth"r dies away, that, consequently, cr9ssing does not produce some new third language, but preserves one of the languages.
He refers further to another con-clusion, taken from Stalin's report to_ th~ 16~h Congress of the C.
P.
S.
U.
(B.
), where It_ i_s said that in the period of the victory of sociall~m on a world scale, when socialism is co~sol1dated and becomes part of every-day life, national lan-guages will inevitably merge into o~e common language which, of course '"ill b~ ne1 ther Great Russian nor German, .
but sumethmg new.
Com-paring these two formulas and seeing that, far from coinciding, they exclude each other, Com-rade Kholopov falls into despair.
"from your ar-ticle" he writes in his Jetter, "! understood that the 'crossing.
of languages can 11cvcr produce ·some new language, whereas priur to your CJr ticle I was firmly convinced, in contorm1ty w1tlt our speech at the 16th Congress of the Y C.
P.
S.
U.
(B.
), that under communism, languages would merge into one common language.
" Evidently, having discovered a contradict-ion between these two formulas and being deep-ly convinced that the contradiction must be re-moved, Comrade Kholopov considers it necessary to get rid of one of these formulas as incorrect and to clutch at the other as being correct for all periods and countries; but which formula to clutch at -he does not know.
The result is something in the nature of a hopeless situation.
Comrade Kholopov does .
not even suspec:t that both formulas can be correct -each for its own time.
That is always the case with dogmatists and talmudists who do not delve into the es-sence of the matter, quote mechanically and ir-respective of the.
historical conditions of which the quotations treat, and invariably find them-selves in a hopeless situation.
Yet if one examines the essence of the matter, there are no grounds for considering the situation hopeless.
The fact is that Stalin's pamphlet "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics," und Stalin's speech at the 16th Party Congress, ref er to two entirely different epochs, owing to which the formulas, too, prove to be different.
The formula given by Stalin in his pamph-let, in the part where it speaks of the crossing of languages, refers to the epoch prior to the victory of socialism on a world scale, when the exploiting classes are the dominant power in the world; when national and colonial oppression re-mains in force; when national isolation and mu-249tual distrust among nations are consolidated by differences between states; when, as yet, there is no national equality of rights; when the cross-ing of languages takes place as a struggle for the domination of one .
of the languages; when the conditions necessary for the peaceful and friendly co-operation of nations and languages are as yet lacking; wher it is not the co-op-·· eration and mutual enrichment of languages that are on the order of the day, but the assimil-•tion of some .
and the victory of other lan-;uages.
It is clear that in such conditions there :an only be victorious and defeated languages.
lt is precisely th~se conditions that Stalin's for-mula has in view when It says that the crossing, say, of two languages, results not in the form-ation of a new language, but in the victory of one of the languages and the def eat of the other.
As regards the other formula by Stalin, taken from his speech at the 16th Party Con-gress, in.
the part that· touches on the merging of languages into one common language, it has in .
view another epo~h, namely, the epoch after the victory of socialism on a world scale, when world imperialism no longer exists; when the ex-'""oiting classes are overthrown and national and qial oppression is eradicated; when national _ttion and mutual d~strust among nations is replaced by mutual confidence und rnpproche-ment between natiorts; when national equality 'ias been put into practice; when the policy of :>pressing and assimilating languages is abolish-250 ed; when the co-operation of nations has been established, and it is possible for national lan-gua.
ges · freely, to enrich one another through their co-operation.
It is clear thut in these con-ditions there cw1 be 110 question uf the suppres-slOn and defeat of so111e lunguages and the vic-tory of others.
Here we shall have not two lan-guages, one of which is to suffer def eat, while the other is to emerge from the struggle victor-10u.
s'.
but hundreds of national languages, out of ~~1ch, as a result of a prolonged economic, po-lltlcal and cultural co-operation of nations, there will first appear most enriched unified zo-nal languages, and subsequently the zonal lan-guages will merge into a single international lan-guage, which, of course, will be neither German nor Russian, nor English, but a new languag~ that has absorbed the best elements of the na-tional and zonal languages.
Consequently, the two different formulas correspond to two different epochs in the de-velopment of society, and precisely because they correspond to them, both formulas are correct -each for its epoch.
To demand that these formulas should not be at variance with each other, that they should not exclude each other, is just as absurd as it would be to demand that the epoch of the domi-nation of capitalism should not be at variance with the epoch of the domination of socialism, that socialism and capitalism should not exclude each other.
The dogmatists and talmudists.
regard Marx-ism and separate conclusions and formulas of Marxism as a collection of dogmas, which "nev-er" change, notwithstanding changes in the con-ditions of the development of society.
They be-lieve that if · they learn these conclusions und formulas· by heart and st<1rt citing tlwm at r<rn-: dom, they wi11 be able t <> solve <-lllY prolJlelll, reckoning that ·the n]emorized conclusions and' formulas wilt serve them for all times and coun-tries, for all occasions in life.
But this can be ''"' conviction only of people who see the letter , 1f Marxism, but not its essence, who learn .
by rote the texts of conclusions and formulas of Marxism, but do, not understand their meaning.
Marxism is the science of the laws govern-ing the development of nature ·and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and ·exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, the science of build-ing communist society.
As a.
science, Marxism cannot stand still, it develops and is perfected.
In its deyelopment, Marxism cannot but be en-riched by new experience, new know ledge -con-sequently, some of i.
ts.
formulas and conclusions cannot but change in the course of time, cannot but.
be replaced by new formulas and conclu-sions, corresponding to the new historic31 tasks.
~\lrxism does not recognize invariable con-;.
.
Sions and formulas, obligatory for all epochs and periods.
Marxism is the enemy of all dogma-tism.

How do you evaluate the last declar-ation of the British Prime Minister Attlee, in the House of Commons, that since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has not disarmed; that is, they h~ve not demobilized their troops; that the Soviet Union has since then even fur-ther increased their forces? A.
I evaluate this declaration of Prime Minister Attlee as a slander on the Soviet Union.
The whole world knows that the Soviet Union has demobilized its troops after the war.
As it is known, the demobilization was carried out in three phases: the first and second phases 111 the year 1945, and the third phase from May to September, I 946.
In addition, in the years 1~)4G and_ 19-17, the ciemobilizutio.
n of oilier age p,roups ot the Soviet army WiJS carried through and, starting in 19·18, the rest ol the older age groups were demobilized.
That is a generally known fact.
If Prime Minister Attlee was conversant with finance and economy he would be able to understand, without difficulty, that no one state, also not the Soviet Union, is in the position to completely develop the volume of their peace industry, -even more, -dozens of billions of the state expenditure is required for the purpose of bLiilding, such as the hydro-power works on I lit· Volga, DniepL:r and Amu-Darya; to introduce "Pll.

Please accept, Comrade Chairman, my sin-cere good wishes on the occasion of the first anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Chinese .

Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Support.
· I do not doubt that our treaty, and the friendly alliance of the People's Republic of Chi-na and the Soviet Union, will continue in the future to strengthen the peace of the entire world.

/I UU/l lj 1 J 9 5 fthe policy of a systematic reduction in the price of con::iurner goods.
Likewise, dozens of bil-lions of the state expenditure is needed to im-mediately add to the hundreds of billions for the reconstruction of the economy demolished by the German occupation, to expand the peo.
.
: pie's economy· and at the same time to increase their military forces and develop their war in-· dustry.
It is not difficult to understand that .
uch a foolisl1 policy would lead to state bank-ruptcy.
!,rime Minister Attlee must, from his own experience· as well as from the experience of the U.
S.
A.
, know that the increasing of the military forces of countries and the development the arms race would· lead to a limitation of peace industry, to a close-down of great building, to a raising of tax and to a rais-1•• 6 uf the price of consumer goods.
It is under-standable that, if the Soviet Union does not limit the peace industry but, on the contrary, furthers it, then new · building, greater hydro-power works and water ·systems will not be sus-pended out, on the contrary, developed, the pol-icy of reducing price~ will not be suspended but, on the contrary, cont.
inued, they could not at the same time develop their war industry a11d increase their military strength without thereby taking the risk of bankruptcy.
And if Prime Minister Attlee, despite all these facts and economic considerations, never-theless holds it possible to openly insult the So-viet Union and its peaceful politics, one can on-ly declare that, by _slandering the Soviet Union, the present Labour government in England wants to justify carrying on their own arms race.
Prime Minister Attlee needs to lie about.
the Soviet Union; he must represent the peace-ful politics of the Soviet Union as aggressive, and the aggressive politics of the English govern-ment as peaceful politics to mislead the English people, to blindfold them with this lie about the Soviet Union, and in this way drag them to-wards a new world war that would be organized by the warmongering circles in the United States of America.
Prime Minister Attlee pretends to be a fol-lower of peace.
But if he really is for peace, why was he against the proposal of the Soviet Union in the United Nations Organization on the conclusion of a peace pact between the Soviet Union, England, the United States of America, China and f ranee? If he really is for peace, why is he against the proposals of the Soviet Union to immediate-ly begin to limit armaments and to immediately forbid atomic weapons? If he really is for peace, why does he per-secute those that intercede for the defence of peace; why has he forbidden the peace congress in England? Could the campaign for the defence of peace possibly threaten the security of Eng-land? It is clear that Prime Minister Attlee is not for the keeping of peace, but rather for the unleashing of a new world-encompassing war of aggression.
Q.
What do.
you think about the inter-vention in Korea? How can that end? A.
If England and the United States of America finally decline the proposals of the People's.
Government of China for peace, t.
hen the war in Korea can only end in defeat of the interventionists.
1 Q.
Why? Are then, the American and Eng-lish generals and officers.
' worse than the Chi-nese and Korean? A.
No, not worse.
The American and Eng-lish generals and officers are not worse than the generals and officers of any other country you like to nanie.
Where the soldiers of the U.
S.
A.
and England are concerned, in the war against Hitler-Germany and milit?ristic Japan, they proved to be the best side, as is known.
Where, then, .
lies the difference? In th.
at the soldiers in the war against Korea and China do not consider it as just, whereas in the war against.
Hitler-Germany · a:nd militaristic Japan, they considered it absolutely just.
It also lies in that this war is extremely unpopular among the American and English.
soldiers.
In this case it is difficult to convince the soldiers that China, who threatened neither Eng-land nor: America, from whom the Americans stole the island of Taiwan, are aggressors, and that the U.
S.
A.
, having stolen the island of Tai-wan and led their troops straight to the borders of China, is the defending side.
It is therefore difficult to convince the troops that the ' 1.
S.
A.
is right to def end its security on i·~orean terri-tory and on the borders of China, and that Chi-na and Korea are not right to def end their sec-urity bn their own territory or on the borders of their states.
Thal is why the war ·is unpopul-ar among the Americ;_in and English soldiers.
It is understandable that experienced gen-erals and .
officers will suffer a defeat if their soldiers are forced into a war which they con-sider totally unjust, and if they believe their duties at the front to be formal, without be-lieving in the justice of their mission, without feeling enthusiasm.
· Q.
How do you evaluate the decision of the United Nations Organization to declare the Chinese People's Republic as the aggressors? A.
I regard it as a scandalous decision.
Really, one must have lost what was left of conscience lo maintuin thut the United States of America, which has stolen Chinese ter-ritory, the island of Taiwan, and fallen upon China's borders in Korea, is the· defensive side; and on the other hand, to declare that the Chi-nese People's Republic which has defended its borders and striven to take back the island of Taiwan, stolen by the Americans, is the aggres-sor.
The United Nations Organization, which was created as a bulwark for keeping peace, has been transformed into an instrument of war, a means to unleash a new world war.
The aggres-sive core of the United Nations Organization have formed the aggressive North Atlantic pact from ten member states (the U.
S.
A.
, England,France, Belgium, · Canada, Holland, Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway, Icel~nd) and twenty Latin-Am-erican countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chi-le, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Equador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Hai-ti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Para.
: guay, Peru, Or~quay, Venezuela.
) And the rep-resentatives of these c.
ountries now make the de-· · cisions in the United Nations Organization about war and peace.
It was these that have, in the United Nations .
Organizations, carried through the scandalous ·decision about the aggression of the Chinese People's Republic.
It is typical of the.
present situation in the United Nations Organization, that, for example, the little Dominican Republic in America that has a population figure of scarcely two rn i II ion, has today the same weight in tile Urtited Na-tions Organization as India has, and a much greater weight than the Chinese People's Repub-lic, which has been robbed of a· voice in the United Nations Organization.
Thus, the United Nations Organization, from being a world .
organization of nations with equal rights, has changed into an instrument· of a war of aggression.
In reality, the United Na-tions Organization is now not so much a world organization as an organization for the Amer-icans and treats American aggression as accept-able.
Not only the United States of America and Canada are striving to unleash a new war, but on this path you also find the twenty Latin-American countries; their landowners and mer-chants long for a new war somewhere in Europe or Asia, to sell their goods to the countries at inflated prices, and to make millions out of this liluody business.
The fact is not a secret to any-liody that the representatives of the twenty I .
utin-American countries represent the strongest supporters <;1nd the willing army of the United.
States of America in the United Nations Organ-ization.
The United· Nations Organization treads, in this manner, the inglorious path of the League of Nations.
Thereby they bury their moral au-thority and fall into decay.
Q.
Do you hold a new world war to be un-avoidable? A.
No.
At least, one can, at present, hold it to be not unavoidable.
Of course, in the United States of Amer-ica, in England .
and also in France, there are aggressive powers that long for a new war.
They need war to achieve super .
.
.
profits and to plunder other countries.
These are the billion-aires and millionaires that regard war as a fountain of revenue, that brings colossal profits.
They, the aggressive powers, hold the re-actionary governments in their hands and guide them.
But at the same time they are afraid of their people who do not want a new war and are for the keeping of peace.
Therefore they take the trouble of using the reactionary govern-ments to ensnare their people with lies, to de-ceive them, to represent a new war as a war of defence, and the peaceful politics of peace-loving countries as aggressive.
They take the trouble to deceive the people, to force them and draw them into new war with their ag-gressive plans.
They therefore even fear the campaign fo~ the defence of peace, they fear that this cam-paign would expose the aggressive int~ntions of the reactionary govern~ents.
They therefore even oppose the proposals of the Soviet Union on the conclusion of a peace treaty, on the limitation of armaments and on the forbidding of atomic weapons; they fear that the acceptance of these proposals would frustrate the aggressive measures of the reactionary governments' and render the arms race unnecessary.
Where will all this struggle-b1:twee11 the aggressive and the peace-loving power:-; e11d? .
Peace will be kept and strengL11t~11ed Ii Ll1e ·ople take the holding of peace into their own : : and defend it to the utmost.
War could e unavoidable if the arsonists of war succeed m trappin.
g the masses with their lies, in deceiv-ing them and in dra}'\'.
itlg them into a new war.
Now, therefore, a broad campaign for the holding of peace, as a way of exposing the crim-inal machinations of the arsonists of war, is of prime importance.
As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it will continue to tarry through the politics of preventing war and keeping peace.

229, 2 October 1951) ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS OF A "PRAVDA" CORRESPONDENT On i}u>_ Atomic weupon wp~avd.
a,w 6 Octo&e~, 1951 Q.
What do you think of the clamour in the foreign press these days in connection with · an Atom bomb test in the Soviet Union? .
A.
As a matter of fact, we have carried·' out a test of a certain kind of Atom bomb.
Tests with Atom bombs of different calibres.
' will also continue, in accordance with the plans for the defence of our country against an at-Luck carried out by th.
e Anglo-American aggres-sive bloc.
Q.
In connection with the Atom bomb test, various well-known personalities in the U.
S.
A.
pretend to be alarmed and shout that the sec-urity of the U.
S.
A.
is threatened.
ls there any ground for such excitement? A.
There is no ground whatsoever for such excitement.
These well-known personalities in the U.
S.
A.
cannot be unaware that the Soviet Union is not only against the application of Atomic weapons, but also for their forbidding, for the cessation of their production.
As it is known, the ~oviet Union has repeatedly demanded the forbidding of Atomic weapons, but each time t ltey were ref used by the powers of the Atlantic l1loc.
That signifies that in the case of an at-1 ,wk by tile U.
S.
A.
on our country, the ruling , in:les of the U.
S.
A.
would use the Atom bomb.
1 ltis circumstance has forced the Soviet Union Lo also own Atomic weapons to meet the aggres-sors well armed.
Of course, it would please the aggressors if the Soviet Union was unarmed in the case of them undertaking an attack.
But the Soviet Union is not in agreement with that, and be-lieves that one must meet the aggressor well armed.
Consequently, if the U.
S.
A.
does not have the intention of attacking the Soviet Union, one must hold the excitement of well-known person-alities of the U.
S.
A.
as purposeless howling, as the Soviet Union is not thinking of attacking, at any time, the U.
S.
A.
or any other country.
279Well-known personalities of the U.
S.
A.
are dissatisified that not only the U.
S.
A.
, but also other countries and, above all, the Soviet Union, possess the secret of Atomic weapons.
They would rather that the U.
S.
A.
had the monopoly on Atom bomb production, that the U.
S.
A.
had unlimited possibilities to frighten and _blackmail other countries.
What.
grounds do they have for' really thinking so, what right do they have? Do the interests of safeguarding peace demand such cl monopoly, pe.
rhaps? Would it not be more cor-rect ·to say that it is ex<.
icLly the opposite case, that the safeguarding uf peace demands, above all, the liquidation of · ~uch monopolies and the unconditional forbidding of Atomic weapons? I think that the adherents of the Atom bomb would only agree to forbid Atom'ic weapons in the case of ~hem seeing that they do not have the monopoly any more.
Q.
What do you .
think of international con-trol of the supply of Atomic weapons? A.
The Soviet Union is for the forbidding of Atomic weapons and for the suspension of the · production of Atomic weapons.
The Soviet Union is for the establishment of international control, for a decision on the forbidding of At-omic weapons, on the suspension of production of Atomic weapons and on the use of already · manufactured Atom bombs for civilian purposes exclusively and conscientiously.
The Soviet Union " for such an international control.
Well-known American personalities likewise speak of "control," but their "control" is based not on the suspension of the production of Atom-ic weapons, but rather on the continuation of such production and, this to such an extent that corresponds to the available sources of raw materials available to this or that country.
Con-sequently, the American "control" is not for the forbidding of Atomic weapons, but rather for their legalization and sanctioning.
That would sanction the right of the arsonists of war, with the help of Atomic weapons, to annihilate tens of thousands, no, -hundreds of thousands of peaceful people·.
It is not difficult to understand that this is not control, but rather a mockery of control, a deception of the peace-desiring people.
Of course, such a "control" will not sat-isfy the peace-loving people, who demand ~he forbidding of Atomic weapons and the suspension of their production.

eA, 1951 To the Chief Editor of the Kyodo Agency, Mr.
Kiishi Iwamoto.
Dear Mr.
Iwamoto! I have received your re-quest to send the ] c!panese people a message for New Year.
It is not a tradition of Soviet statesmen to send greetings to the people of another state.
But the great sympathy that the people of the Soviet Union have for the Japanese peo-ple, who have suffered misery through foreign occupation, leads me to make an exception to the rule and to accede to your request.
I · ask you to convey to the Japanese peo-ple my wishes for their freedom and happiness, as well as success in their courageous struggle for the independence of their homeland.
The people of the Soviet Union have in the past, learnt to know themselves, the terror of foreign occupation, in which the Japanese imperialists took purt.
Therefore, they fully understand the sorrow of the Japanese people, h<Jve great sympathy for them and believe that t lw rebirth and imlependence of their homeland w i II be achieved, even as it was by the people of the Soviet Union.
I wish the Japanese workers liberation from unemployment, from poor wages, the abo-lition of high prices for consumer goods and suc-cess in the struggle for keeping peace.
I wish the Japanese peasants liberation from landlessness and poverty, the abolition of high taxes and success in the struggle for keep-ing peace.
I wish the entire Japanese people and their intelligentsia, complete victory of the dem?crat-ic forces of Japan, the revival and prosperity of the economic life of the country, a blossoming of national culture, knowledge and art as well as success in the struggle for keeping peace.

CHARACTER OF ECONOMIC LAWS UNDER SOCIALISM Some com1«1de.
-.

deny Lile objective char-"' ler of laws of sl·il:11ce, <111<J of the laws of po-': 11c0l eco11urny punicularly, UJ 1der socialism • .
i1\:y Jeny that tl1e laws of political economy re-i l,·,·t law-guvernl:d processes which operate in-\1,·pendently of the will of ma11.
They believe Llidt in view of the specific role assigned to the Soviet state by hi::;tory, the Soviet state alld its 1,~aders can abolish existing laws of political ec-onomy and can "form," "create," new laws.
These comrades are profoundly mistaken.
It is evident that they confuse laws of science, which reflect objective processes in nature or society, processes which .
take place independent-.
ly of the will of man, with the laws which are issued by governments, which are mad~ by the will of man, and which have only juridical valid-· · ity.
But they must not be.
confused.
Marxism regards laws of science -whether they be laws of .
natural science or laws of po-litical economy· -as the reflection of objective processes which take place independently of the will of man.
Man may .
discover these laws, get to know them, study them, reckon with them in is activities and utilize them in the interests society, but he cannot change or abolish 1em.
Still less can he form or create new laws uf science.
Does this mean, .
for instance, that the re-sults of the action of· .
the laws of nature, the results of the action of the forces of nature, are generally inavertible, that the destructive action of the forces of· nature always and every-where proceeds with an elemental and inexor-able power that does not yield to the influence of man? No, it does not.
Leaving aside astro-nomical, geological and other similar processes, which, even if he has come to know the laws of their development, man really is powerless to influence, in many ot~er cases man is very far f'rom powerless, in the sense of being able to in-fluence the processes of nature.
In all such cases, having come to know the laws of nature, reckoning with them and relying on them, and intelligently applying and utilizing them, man can restrict their sphere of action, and can im-part a different direction to the destructive forces of nature and convert tham to the use of society .
.
· To take one of numerous examples.
In old-en times the overflow of big rivers, flood, and the resulting destruction of homes and crops, was consider~d an inavertible calamity, against which man was powerless.
But with the lapse of 1 i me <rnd the <.

More, man learned to curb the destructive forces of nature, tu harness them, so to speak, to convert the force of water to the use of society and to util-i.
te it for the irrigation of field-" and the gen-<'.
ration of power.
Does this mean that man has thereby abol-1c,l1ed laws of nature, laws of science, and has ··r<'dted new laws of nature, new laws of scien-, ,,.
, No, it uoes rllll.
The fact is that all this ,.
, •)( ·c'.
dure of averting the action of the destruct-''<' furces of Wdter and of utilizing them in the .
t1·1·<·sts of society tdkes place without any vio-" 1"11, ultcrdtion or <.
1bolitiun of scientific laws ,,, ll1t· cre<Jlion of r1cw scientific laws.
On the • <i11lr<tr·y, all this procedure is t'.
ffected in pre-1·1~;l: conformity with the laws of nature and thelaws of science, since any violation, even the slightest, of the laws of nature would only upset matters and render the procedure futile.
The same must be said of the.
laws of ec-onomic development, the laws of political econ~ omy -·whether in the period of capitalism or in the period o( socialism.
.
Here, too, the laws of economic development,.
as in the case of natural.
science, are objective laws, reflecting processes of economic development which take place in-dependently of the will of man.
Man may dis-cover these laws, get to know them and relying upon them, utilize them in the interests of so-ciety, impart a different direction to the de-structive action of some of the laws, restrict their sphere of action, and allow fuller scope to other laws that are forcing their way to the forefront; but he cannot destroy them or create new economic· laws.
One of the distinguishing features of po-litical economy is that .
its laws, unlike those of natural science, are impermanent, that they, or ;.
it least the majority of them, operate for a def-inite historical period 1 after which they give way to new laws.
However, these laws are not abolished, but lose their validity owing to the new economic conditions and depart from the scene in order to give place to new laws, laws which are not created by the will of man, but which arise from the' new economic conditions.
Reference is made to Engels' "Anti-DUhring," to his formula which says that, with the abolition of capitalism and the socialization of the means of production, man will obtain con-trol of his means of production, that he will be set free from the yoke of social and economic relations and become the "master" of his sociai life.
Engels calls this freedom "appreciation of necessity.
" And what can this "appreciation of necessity" .
.
mean? It means that, having come to know objective laws ("necessity"), man will apply them with full consciousness in the interests of society.
That .
ls why Engels says in the same book: "The laws of his· own social activity, which have hitherto confronted him as extraneous laws of nature dominating him, will then be applied by man with complete understanding, and hence will be dominated by man.
" · As we see,.
Engels' formula does not speak at all in favour of those who think that under socialism economic laws can be abolished and new ones created.
On the contrary, it demands not the abolition, but the understanding of econ-omic laws and their intelligent application.
It is said that economic laws are element-al in character, that their action is inavertible and that society is powerless against them.
That is not true.
It is making a fetish of laws, and oneself the slave of laws.
It has been demon-strated that society is not powerless against laws, that, having come to know economic laws and relying upon them, society can restrict their ~phere of action, utilize them in the interests of society and "harness" them, just as in the case of the forces of nature and their laws, justas in the case of the overflow of big rivers cited in the illustration above.
Reference is made to the specific role of Soviet government in building socialism, which allegedly enables it to .
abolish existing laws of economic development and to "form" new ones·.
That is also untrue.
The specific role.
of Soviet government was· · ' due to two circumstances: first, that what So-viet .
g9vernment had to do was not to replace one form of exploitation by another, as was the case· in earlier 'revolutions, but to abolish exploit-ation altogether; second, that in view of the ab-sence in the country 'of any ready-made rudi-ments of a socialist economy, it had to create new, socialist forms of economy, "starting from scratch,ir so to speak.
That was undoubtedly a difficult, complex and unprecedented task.
Nevertheless, the Soviet government accomplished ·this task with credit.
l3ut it accomplished it .
not because it supposedly destroyed the existing economic laws and "form-ed" new ones, but only because it relied on the economic law that .
the relations of production must necessarily conform with the character of the productive forces.
The productive forces of our country, especially in industry, were social in character, the form of ownership, on the other hand, was private, capitalistic.
Relying on the economic law that the relations of product-ion must necessarily conform with Lhe character of the productive forces, the Soviet government socialized the means of production, made them the property of the whole people, and thereby abolished the exploiting system and created so-cialist· forms of economy.
Had it not been for this .
law, and had the Soviet government not re-lied upon it, it could not have accomplished its mission.
The economic law that the relations of pro-duction must necessarily conform with the char-acter of the productive forces has long been forcing its way to the forefront in capitalist countries.
If is has failed so far to force its way into the open~ it.
is because it is encounter-ing powerful resistance on the part of obsoles-cent forces of society.
Here we have another distinguishing f ea tu re of economic laws.
Unlike the laws of natural science, where the discovery and application of a new law proceeds more or less smoothly, the discovery and application of a new law in .
the economic field, affecting as it does the interests of obsolescent forces of so-ciety, meets with the most powerful resistance on their part.
A force, a social force, capable of overcoming this resistance, is therefore neces-sary.
In our country, such a force was the al-liance of the working class and the peasantry, who represented the overwhelming majority of society.
There is no such force· yet in other, capitalist countries.
This explains the secret why the Soviet government was able to smash the old forces of society, and why in our country the economic law that the relations of pro-duction must necessarily conform with the char-acter of the productive forces received fullscope.
It is said that the necessity for balanceJ (proporl ion<Jte) · development of the national ('C-onomy in our country enables the Soviet govern-ment to ;1bolish existing economic luws and to creuu~ 11cw 011es.
That is absolutely untrue.
Our· yearly and live-yearly plans must not be confus-ed with the objective economic law of balanced, proportio11ute development of the national ec-unomy.
The law of balanced development of the national economy arose in opposition to the law of competition ·and anarchy of production under capitalism.
It arose from the socialization of the means of production, after the law of com-petition and anarchy of .
production had lost its validity.
lt became operative beGause a socialist economy can be conducted only on the basis of the economic law of balanced development of the nalionul economy.
That means that the law of balanced development of the national econ-omy makes it possible for our planning bodies to pl~in soci;,il production correctly.
But pos-sibility must not be confused with actuality.
They are L wo different things.
In order to turn the possibility into actuality, it is necessary to study this economic law, to master it, to learn to apply it with full underst&nding, and to com-pile such plans as fully reflect the requirements of this law.
It cannot be said that the require-ments of this economic law are fully reflected by our yearly and five-yearly plans.
It is said that some of the economic laws operating 111 our country.
under socialism, includ-ing the law of value, have bee11 "transformed," or even "radically trnnsformed," on the basis of planned economy.
Thut is likewise untrue.
Laws cannot be "transformed," still less "radically" transformed.
If they can be transformed, then they can be abolished and replaced by other laws.
The thesis that laws can be "transformed" is a relic of the incorrect formula that laws can be "abolished" or "formed.
" Although the for-mula that economic laws can be transformed has already been current in our country for a long time, it must be abandoned for the sake of accuracy.
The sphere of action of this or that economic law may be restricted, its destructive uction -thut is, of course, if it is liable to be destructive -may be averted, but it cannot be "transformeJ" or "abolished.
" Conseque11Lly, when we speak of "subjug-ating" natural forces or economic forces, of "do-minating" them, etc.
, this does not mean that man can "abolish" or "form" scientific laws.
On the contrary, it only means that man can discov-er laws, get to know them and master them, learn to apply them with full understanding, ut-ilize them in the ir1terests of society, and thus subjugate them, secure mastery over them.
Hence, the laws of political economy under socialism are objective laws, which reflect the fact that the processes of economic life are law-governed and operate independently of our will.
People who deny this postulate are in point of fact denying science, and, by denying sci~nce, they are denying all possibility of prognosucat-ion -and, consequently, are denying the pos-sibility of directing economic activity.
It may be said that all this is correct and generally known; but that there is nothing new in it, and that it is therefore not worth spend-ing time re-iterating generally known truths.
· o'f course, there· r~ally is nothing new in this; but it would be a mistake to think that -it is not'· worth spending time re-iterating certain truths that are well known ·to us.
The fact is that we, the leading core, are joined every year by thou-sands of new and young forces who are ardently desirous of assisting us and ardently desirous of proving their worth, but who do not possess an adequate Marxist education, are unfamiliar with many truths that are well known to us, and are therefore compelled to grope in the darkness.
They are staggered by the colossal achievements of Soviet government, they are dazzled by the extraordinary successes of the Soviet system, and they begin to ima.
gine that Soviet govern-ment can "do anything," ,that "nothing is beyond it," that it can abolish scientific laws and form new ones.
What are.
we to do with these com-rades? How are we to educate them in Marxism-Leninism? I think that systematic re-iteration and patient explanation of so-called "generally known" truths is one of the best methods of ed-ucating these comrades in Marxism.
2.
COMMODITY PRODUCTION UNDER SOCIALISM Certain comrades affirm tltat the Party acted wrongly in preserving commodity product-ion after it had assumed power and nationalized the ·means.
· of production in our country.
They consider that the Party should have banished commodity production there and then.
In this connection they cite Engels, who says: "The seizure of the means of production by society puts an end to commodity production, and· therewith to the domination of the product over the producer.
" (See "Anti-Duhring.
") These comrades are profoundly mistaken.
Let us examine Engels' formula.
Engels' I ormula cannot be considered fully clear and prt'.
cise, because it does not indicate whether it h referring to tile seizure by society of all or only part of the means of production, that is whether all or only part of the · means of pro-duction are converted into public property.
Hen-ce, this formula of Engels' may be understood either way.
Elsewhere in "Anti-Diihring," Engels speaks of mastering "all the means of production," of taking possession of "all means of production.
" Hence, this formula of Engels has in mind the nationalization not of part, but of all the means of production, that is, the conversion into pub-! ic property of the means of production not only of industry, but also of agriculture.
It follows from this that Engels has in.
mind countries where capitalism and the concen-tration of production have advanced far enough both in industry and in agriculture to permit the expropriation of all 'the means of production in the country and their conversion into public property.
Engels, consequently, considers that· in· such countries; parallel with the socialization of ull the means of production, commodity pro-·· duction should be put an end to.
And that, of course, is correct.
There wa~ .
only one· such country at the dose· of the last century, when "Anti-Dohring" as published -Britain.
There the development ,f capitalism and, the concentration of product-iOn both in industry and· agriculture had reached such a point that it would have been possible, in the event of the assu~·ption of power by the proletariat, to convert all the country's means :>f production 'into public property and to.
put an end to commodity prodµction.
I leave aside in t~i~ instance the question of the importance of foreign trade to Britain and the vast part it plays in her national econ-o~y.
I thi~k that only.
aft.
er an investigation of this question can it be finally decided what would be the future of commodity production in Britain after the proletariat had.
assumed power and all the means of production had· been nation-However, not only at the close of the last century, but today too, no country has attained such a degree of development of capitalism and concentration of production in agriculture as is to be observed in Britain.
As to the other count-ries, notwithstanding the development of capital-ism in the countryside, they still have a fairly numerous class of small and medium rural owner-producers, whose future would have to be de-cided if the proletariat should assume power.
But here is a question: what are the pro-letariat and its party to do in countries, ours be-ing a case in point, where the conditions are favourable for .
the assumption of power by the proletariat and the overthrow of capitalism, where capitalism has so concentrated the means of production in industry that they may be ex-propriated and made the property of society, but where agriculture, notwithstanding the grow-th of capitalism, is divided up among numerous small and medium owner-producers to such an extent as to make it impossible to consider the expropriation of these producers? To this question Engels' formula does not furnish an· answer.
Incidentally, .
it was not sup-posed to furnish an answer to it, since it arose from another question, namely, what should be the fate of commodity production after all the means of production had been socialized.
And so, what is to be done if not all, but only part of the means of production have been socialized, yet the conditions are favourable for the assumption of power by the proletariat -should the proletariat assume power, and should commodity production be abolished immediately after this? We cannot, of course, consider an answer 301the opinion of certain half-baked Marxists, who believe that under such conditions the thing to do is to refrain from taking power and to wait until capitalism has succeeded in ruining the mil-lions of.
small and medium producers and con-verting them into farm labourers and in con~ centrating the ineans of production in agricult-ure, and that only after this would it be pos-· · sible to consider the assumption of power by the proletariat and the socialization of all the means of prodµction.
Naturally, this is a "solu-tion" which Marxists cannot accept if they do not want to disgrace themselves completely.
.
Nor can we consid~r an answer the opinion of other half-baked Marxists, who think that the thing to do would be to· assume power and to expropriate the small and medium rural pro-ducers and to socialize their means of pro-duction.
Marx.
ists cannot adopt this senseless and criminal course either, because it would destroy all chances of victory.
for the socialist revo-lution, and would throw the peasantry into the camp of the enemies of the proletariat for a long time.
.
.
The answer to this question was given by Lenin in his writings on the "tax in kind" and in his celebrated "co-operative plan.
1' Lenin's answer may be briefly summed up as follows: a) favourable conditions for the assumption power should not be missed -the proletariat should assume power without waiting until cap-italism succeeded in ruining the millions of :;mall and medium individual producers; b) The means of production in industry should be expropriated and converted into public property; c) As to the small and medium individual producers, they should gradually be united in producers' co-operatives, i.
e.
, in large agricultur-al enterprises, collective farms; d) Industry should be developed to the ut-most and the collective farms should be placed on the modern technical basis of large-scale pro-duction, not expropriating them, but on the ·con-trary generously supplying them with first class tractors and other machines; e) In order to ensure an economic bond be-tween town and country, between industry and agricµlture, commodity production (exchange through purchase ·and sale) should be preserved for a certain period, it being the form of econ-omic tie with the town which is alone accept-able to the peasants, and Soviet.
trade -state, co-operative and collective farm -should be de-veloped to the full and the capitalists of all types and descriptions ousted from trading ac-tivity.
The history of socialist construction in our country has shown that this path of develop-ment, mapped out by Lenin, has fully justified itself.
There can be no doubt that in the case of all capitalist countries with a more or less nu-merous class of small and medium producers, this path of development is the only possibleand expedient one· for the victory of socialism.
It is said that commodity production must lead, is bound to lead, to capitalism all the same, under all conditions.
That is not true.
Not always .
and not under all conditions! Commodity production must not be identified with capitalist production.
They are two different things.
Cap-italist production is the highest form of com mod_:· ity production.
Commo'dity production leads to capitalism only if there is private ownership of :1e means of, .
production, "if labour power ap-pears on the market as a commodity which can be bought by the capitalist and exploited in the process of production,· ~nd if, consequently, the system of exploitation of wageworkers by cap-italists exists in the country.
Capitalist product-ion begins when the .
means of production are concentrated in private hands, and when the workers are 'bereft of means of production and arc compelled to sel.
l their labour power as a· commodity.
Without this.
there is no such thing as capitalist production.
· Well, and what is to be done if the con-ditions for the conversion of commodity product-ion into capitalist production do not exist, if the means of production are no longer private but socialist property, if the system of wage la-bour no longer exists and labour power is no 1longer a commodity, and if the system of ex-ploitation has long been.
abolished -can it be considered then that commodity production will lead to capitalism all the same? No, it cannot.
Yet ours is precisely such a society, a society where private ownership of the means of pro-duction, the system of wage labour, and the sys-tem o.
f exploitation lwve long ceased to exist.
Commodity production must not be· regard-ed as something sufficient unto itself, some-thing independent of the .
surrounding economic conditions'.
Commodity production is older than cap.
italist production.
It existed in slave-owning society, and served it, but did not lead to cap-italism.
It existed in feudal society and served it, yet, although it prepared some of the con-ditions for capitalist production, it did not lead to capitalism.
Why then, one.
asks, cannot com-modity production similarly serve our socialist society for a certain period without leading to capitalism, bearing in mind that in our country commodity production is not so boundless and all-embracing as· it is under capitalist conditions, being confined.
within strict bounds thanks to such decisive economic conditions as social own-ership of the means of producti.
on, the abolition of the system of wage labour, and the eliminat-ion of the system of exploitation? It is said that, since the domination of so-cial ownership of the means of production has been established in our country, and the system of wage labour and exploitution has been abol-ished, commodity production has lost all mean-ing and should therefore be done away with.
That is also untrue.
Today there are tw.
o !Jasic forms of socialist production in our count-ry: state, or publicly owned production, and col-lective farm production, which cannot be said 305to be publicly owned.
In the state enterprises, the means of production and the product of pro-duction are national property.
In the collective farm, although the means of production {land, machines) do belong to the state, the product of production is the property of the different collective farms, since the labour, as well as true seed, is their own, while the · land, which· · has been turned over ·to the collective farms in perpetual tenure, is used· by them virtually as their own property, in spite of the fact that they cannot sell', ·buy, lease or mortgage it.
The effect of this is that the state dis.
.
.
: poses only of th.
e product of the state enter-prises, while the product of the collective far-ms, being their property, is disposed of only by them.
But the collective farms are unwilling to alienate their products except in the form of commodities, in exchange for which they· desire to receive the commodities they need.
At pres-ent the collective farms will not recognize any other eco_nomic relation with the town except the commodity relation -.
exchange through pur-chase and sale.
Beca4s~ of this, commodity pro-duction and trade are as much a necessity with us today as they were thirty years ago, say, when Lenin spoke of the necessity of developing trade to the utmost.
Of course, when instead of the two basic ,roduction sectors, the state sector and the col-.
:ctive farm sector, there will be only one all-embracing production sector, with the right to dispose of all the consumer goods produced in tile country, comrnudity circul1:11 ion, with its "money economy," will disappear, ;1s being :.
in un-necessary element in tile national .
economy.
13ut so long as this is IJ()t the case, so long as the two.
basic production sectors rem Jin, commodity production and commodity circul:.
ition must re-main in force, as a necessary and very useful element in our system of national economy.
How the formation of a single and united sect-or will come about, whether simply by the swal-lowing up of tlte collectivf~ farm sector by the state· sector -w hil'll is hardly likely (because that would be looked upon as the expropriation of the collective farms) -or by the setting up of a sing I<' nc1t ional economic body (comprising n,presentat iv es of stale industry and of the col-lt:ctive farms), with tlH~ right al first to keep account of all consumer product in the country, and eventually also to distribute 1t, by way, say, of products-exchange is a special question which requires separnte discussion-.
Consequently, our commodity production is not of the ordinary type, but is a special kind of commodity production, commodity production without capitalists, which is concerned mainly with the goods of associated socialist producers (the state, the collective farms, the co-oper-atives), the sphere of action of which .
is con-fined to items of personal consumption, which obviously cannot possibly develop into capitalist production, and which, together with its "money economy," is designed to serve the development and consolidation of socialist production.
Absolutely mistaken, therefore, are those comrades who allege that, since socialist society has not ubolished commodity forms of product-ion, we are bound to have the reappearance of all the economic categories characteristic of capitalism: labour power as a commodity, surp.
:.
lus value, capital, capitalist profit, the average rate of profit, etc.
Th.
ese comrades con.
fuse com-·· modity production with capitalist production, and believe that once there is commodity production there must also be capitalist production.
They do not realize' that our commodity production radicully differs from commodity production un-der cupitalism.
Mon'.
, J think thut we must also discard certain other concepts taken from Marx's "Cap-ital" -where Marx was _concerned with an analy-sis of capitalism -and artificially pasted on to our socialist ·relations.
I am referring to such concepts, among others, as "necessary" and "surp-lus" labour, "necessary'.
' and "surplus" product, "necessary" and "surplus" time.
Marx analyzed capitalism in order to elucidate the source of exploitation of the working class -surplus value -and to arm the working class, which was be-reft of means of production, with an intellectual weapon for the overthrow of capitalism.
It is natural that Marx used concepts (categories) which fully corresponded to capitalist relations.
But it is strange, to say the least, to use these concepts now, when the working class is not on-ly not bereft of power and means of production, but, on the contrary, is in possession of the po-wer ·and controls the means of production.
Talk of labour power being a commodity, and of "hiring" of workers sounds rather absurd now, un-der our system: as though the working class, which possesses means of production, hires it-scl f and sells its labour power to itself.
It is 11 II 1ust us strange to spea k now o f necessary .
ind ":rnrplus" lubour: us though, under our con-d1 t ions, the labour contributed by the workers 1<) society tor the extension of production, the i" ornot io1~ of education und public health, the or-•;11Ii zut io11 of defcnt't', etc.
, is not just as.
neces-~:drV to the working class, now in power, as the lab~rnr expended to supply the personal needs of the worker and his furnily.
It should be remarked that in his "Critique of the Gotha Program," where it is no longer capitalism that he is investigating, but, among other things, the first phase of communist so-ciety, Marx recognizes labour contributed to so-ciety for extension of production, for education and public health, for administrative expenses, for building up reserves, etc.
, to be just as ne-cessary as the labour expended to supply the consumption requirements of the working class.
I think that our economists should put an end to this incongrui• y between the old con-cepts and the new stcL c~ of affairs in our social-ist country, by replacing the old concepts with new ones that correspond to the new situation.
We could tolerate this incongruity for a certain period, but the time has come W put an end to it.
·3.
THt: LAW Of VALUE UNDER SOCIALISM It is sometimes asked whether the law of value exists and operntc~s in our country, under the socialist.
system.
' Yes, it does exist u11d dues uperLJte.
\'\ltt·rc-ever commodities and commodity pniductiu11 l'.
X-ist, there the law of value must ubu exist.
In our country the sphere of operation of the law of value extends, first of all, to com-modity circulation, to the exchange of commod-ities.
through purchase and sale, the exchange, chiefly, of articles of personal consumptfon.
Here, in this spqere, the law of value preserves, within certain limits, of course, the function of a regulator.
But the operation of the law of value is not confined to the sphere of commodity cir-culation.
It also extends to production.
True, the law of value has no regulating function in our.
socialist production, but it nevertheless influ-ences production, and · this fact cannot be ig-nored when directing production.
As a matter of fact, consumer goods, which are needed to com-pensate the labour 'power expended in the pro-cess of production, are produced and realized in our country as commodities coming under the op-eration of the law of value.
It is precisely here that the law of value exercises its influence on production.
In this connection, such things as cost accounting and profitableness, production costs, prices, etc.
, are of actual importance in our enterprises.
Consequently, our enterprises cannot, and must not, function without tuking the law of value into account.
Is ~h!~ ~ 0 ~9gd "'t.
h~~g? It -~s _t)_()_t a bad thing.
Under present conditions, it really is not a bad thing, since it trains our business executives to conduct production on rational lines and discip-lines them.
It is not a bad thing because it teaches our executives to count production mag-nitudes, to count them accurately, and also to culcufate the real things in production precisely, und not to rnlk nonsense about "approximate fig-ures," spun out of thin air.
lt is not a bad thing l1ccause it teaches our executives to look for, li11d and utilize hidden reserves latent in pro-duction, und nut to trample them underfoot.
1t is not a bad thing because it teaches our ex-ecutives systematically to improve methods of production, to lower production costs, to prac-tise cost accounting, and to make their enter-prises pay.
It is a good practical school which accelerates the development of.
our executive personnel and their growth into genuine leaders of socialist production at the present stage of development.
The trouble is not that production in our country is influenced by the law of value.
The trouble is that our business executives and plan-ners, with few exceptions, are poorly acquainted with the operations of the law of value, do not study them, and are unable to take ac_count of them in their computations.
This, in fact, ex-plains the confusion that still reigns in the sphere of price-fixing policy.
Here is one ofmany examples.
Some time ago it was decided to adjust the prices of cotton and grain in the interest ·of cotton growing, to establish more ac-curate prices for grain sold to the cotton grow-ers, and to· raise the prices of cotton delivered to the state •• Our business executives and plan-ners submitted.
a proposal on this score which could not but astound the members of the Cen.
.
:.
· tral Committee, .
since it suggested fixing the price of a ton of grain at practically the same level as a tqn of cotton, and, moreover, the price of a ton of grain was taken as equivalent to that of a ton of baked bread.
In reply to re-marks of the members of the Central Commit-tee that the price of 'a ton of bread must be higher than that of a ton of grain, because of the additional expense of milling and baking, and that cotton was generally much dearer than grain, as wa·s also borne out by their prices in the world market, the authors of the proposals· could find nothing coherent to say.
The Central Committee was therefore obliged to take the matter into its own hands and to lower the prices of grain and r.
aise the prices of cotton.
What would have happened if the proposals of these comrades had received legal force? We should have ruined the cotton growers and would have found ourselves without cotton.
But does this mean that the operation of .
the law of value has as much scope with us as .
it has under capitalism, and that it is the regu-lator ·of production in our country too? No, it does not.
Actually, the sphPre of operation of th~ law of value under our economic system is strictly limited and placed within definite boun-ds.
It .
has already been said that the sphere of operation of cornmod1ty production is restricted dnd placed within ck·l11lile bounds by our system.
I he same must be su1d of tl1e sphere of operat-1011 of ~he law of vuluc.
Umloubtedly, the fact Llwt.
pr1vate owm>rship of th<~ means of pro-duction does not extsl, and that the means of production both in town and coumry are social-1 zed, cannot but restrict the sphere of operation of the law of value and the extent of its in-t luence on production.
In this same direction operates the law of b<.
ilanced (proportionate) development of the na-t tonal.
economy, which has superseded the law (if com pet it ion and anurchy of production.
In this su111c direction, too, operate our 't•urly and five-yearly plans and our economic i">licy generally, which are based on the require-11i('11ts of the ILtw of balanced development of t I Jl~ na tionu I eco11u my.
The effect or" all this, takt·n together, is that the sphere of operation of the law of value in our country is strictly limited, and that the lclw of value cannot under our system function as the regulator of production.
This, indeed, explains the "striking" fact that whereas in our country, the law of value, in spite of the steady and rapid expansion of our socialist production, does not lead to crises of overproduction, in the capitalist countries this same law, whose sphere of ·operation isvery wide under capitalism, does lead, in spite of the low rate of expansion of production, to periodical crises of overproduction.
It is said that the law of value is a perma-nent· law, binding upon all periods of historic?! develop'ment, and that if it does lose its funct-ion as a regul;:itor of exchange relati.
ons in the second phase of communist society it retains a't this phase of development its function as a regu-lator of the relations between the various bran-ches of prod~ction, as a regulator of the dis-tribution of labour among them.
That is quite untrue.
Value, like the law of value, is a historical category connected with the existence of commodity production.
With the disappearance of ccfmmodity production, value and its forms and the law of value also dis-appear.
In the ·second phase of communist· society, the amount of labou.
r expended on the product-ion of goods will be · .
measured not in a round-about way, not through value and its forms, as is the case under commodity production, but di-rectly and immediately by the amount of time, the number of hours, expended on the pro-duction of goods.
As to the distribution of la-bour, ·its distribution among the branches of pro-duction will be regulated not by the law uf val-ue, which will have ceased to function by thLlt time, but by the growth of society's dernw1J fnr goods.
It will be a society in which production ,.
will be regulated by the requirements of so-ciety, and computation of the requirements of society will acquire paramount importance for the planning bodies.
Totally incorrect, too, is the assertion that under our present economic system, in the first phase of development of communist society, the law of value regulates the "proportions" of la-bour distributed among the various branches of production.
If · this ·were true, it would be incompre-hensible why our light industries, which are the most profituble, ~1n· 11ot being ckveloped to the utmost, and why preference is given to our heavy industries, whit·h ure often less profitable, and sometimes altog(·t her unprofiu1ble.
If this were true, it would be incompre-hensible why a number of our heavy industry plants which are still unprofitable and where the labour of the worker does not yield the "proper returns," are not closed down, and why new light industry plants, which would certainly be profitable and where the labour .
of the workers might yield "big returns," are not opened.
If this were true, it would be incompre-lie11sible why workers are not transferred from pL111ts that are le::;s profitable, but very neces-,;iry to our national economy, to plants which c1n· more profitable -in accordance with the IL1w of value, which supposedly regulates the ''pruportions" of labour distributed among the i>ranches of production.
Obviously, if we were to follow the lead of these comrades, we should have to cease giving primacy to the production of means ofproduction in favour of the production of ar-ticles of consumption.
And what would be the effect of ceasing to give primacy to the pro-duction of the means of production? The effect would be to· destroy the possibility of continuous expansion of our national economy, because ·the national econo'my cannot be continuously expand-ed without giving primacy to the production of·· means of production.
These comrades forget that the law of val-ue can be a r~gulator of production only under capitalism, with private ownership of the means ·, r production, and competition, anarchy of pro-duction, and crises of overproduction.
They for-get that in our country' the sphere of operation of the law of value is limited by the social ownership of the means of production, and by the law of balanced development of the national economy, and is consequently also limited by .
' our yearly and f1ve-y~arly plans, which are an approximate reflection .
of the requirements of this law.
Some comrades draw the conclusion from this that the law of .
balanced development of the national economy and economic planning an-nul the principle of profitableness of production.
That is quite untrue.
It is just the other way round.
If profitableness is considered not from the standpoint of individual plants or industries, and not over a period of one year, but from the standpoint of the entire national economy and over a period of, say, tl'n or fifteen years, which is the only correct appru~wh to the quest-ion, then the temporary and unstable profitable-ness of some plants or industries is beneath all comparison with that higher form of stable um!' permanent profitableness which we get from the operation of the law of balanced development of the national economy and from economic planning, which save us from periodical econ-omic crises disruptive to the national economv and causing tremendous material damage to so-ciety, and which ensure a continuous and high rate of expansion of our national economy.
In brief, there can be no doubt that under our present socialist conditions of production, the law of value cannot be a "regulator of the proportions" of labour distributed among the va-riou~ branches of production.

ABOLITION OF THE ANTITHESIS BETWEEN TOWN AND COUNTRY, AND BETWEEN MEN-TAL LABOUR AND PHYSICAL LABOUR, AND ELIMINATION Of DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THEM This heading covers a number of problems which essentially differ from one another.
I com-bine them in one section, not in order to lump lhem together, but solely for brevity of expo-sition.
Abolition of the antithesis between town dlld country, between inclust ry and agriculture, h a well-known problem which was discussedlong ago by Marx and Engels.
The economic ba-sis of this antithesis is the exploitation of the country by the town, the expropriation of the peasantry and the ruin of the majority of the rural population by the whole course of develop-ment of industry, trade and credit under ·cap-italism.
Hence, the antithesis between town and country under capitultsm must be rega.
rded as an antagonism of interests.
This it was that gave rise to the hostile attitude of the country to-wards the town and towards "townfolk" in gen-eral.
Undoubtedly, with the abolition of capital-ism and the exploiting system in our country, and with the consolidation of the socialist sys-tem, the· antagonism ·of interests between town and country, between industry and agriculture, was also bound to disappear.
And that is what 1happened.
The immense assistance rendered by the socialist town, by our working class, to our , peasantry in eliminating 'the landlords and kulaks strengthened the foundation for the alliance be-tween the working class and the peasantry, while the systematic .
supply of first class tract-ors and other machines to the peasantry and its collective farms converted the alliance between the working class and the peasantry into friend-ship between them.
Of course, the workers and the collective farm peasantry do represent two different classes differing from one another in status.
But this difference doe:; not weaken their friendship in any way.
On the contrary, their ·interests lie along one common line, that of strengthening the socialist system and attain-ing the victory 0f communism.
It is not sur-prising, therefore, that not a trace remains of the former distrust, not .
to speak of the former hatred, of the country for the town.
All this means that the ground for anti-thesis between town and country, between in-dustry and agriculture, has already been elimin-ated by our present socia1ist system.
This, of course, does not mean that the· ef-fect of the abolition of the antithesis between town and country wil I be that "the great towns will perish" (Engels, "Anti-Dohring").
Not only will the great towns not perish, but new great towns will appear as centres of the maximum d('velopment of culture, and as centres not only ()f large-scale industry, but also of the process-ing o'f agticul tural produce and of powerful de-velopment of all branches of the food industry.
This will facilitate the cultural progress of the 1wtion and will tend to even up conditions of Ii fe in town and country.
We have a similar situation as regards the problem of the abolition of the antithesis be-t ween mental and physical labour.
This too a wpJJ-known problem which was discussed by :\1;1rx and Engels long ago.
The economic basis "' 1 he 8ntithesis between mental and physical lih 1 )11r is I h<'.
exploit<ition of the physical wrn" ,,, s hv the mental workers.
Everyone is familiai \\ 11 Ii the gulf which under capitalism cli\'ided the Jlh\'sical workers of enterprises from the man-:q~<'ri;d personnel.
We know that this gulf gave isrise to a hostile attitude on the .
part of the workers towards managers, foremen, engineers and other members of the technical staff, whom the workers regarded as their enemies.
Natural-ly, with the abolition of capitalism and the ex-ploiting system, ·the antagonism of interests be-t ween physical and mental l<.
1bour was also bound to disappear.
And it really has disappear-ed in our present socialist system.
Today, the physical workers and the managerial personnel are not enemies, but comrades and friends, mem-bers of a single collective body of producers who are vitally interested in the progress and improvement of production.
Not a trace remains · of the former enmity between them.
· Of quite a different character is the prob-lem of the disappearance of distinctions· be.
tween · town (industry) and country (agriculture), and be-tween physical and mental labour.
This problem was not discussed by the Marxian classics.
It is a new problem, one that has been raised prac-tically by our socialist construction.
Is this problem an imaginary one? J-:Ias it any practical or theoretical importance for us? No, this problem cannot be considered an imag-inary one.
On the contrary, it is for us a prob-lem of the greatest seriousness.
Take, for instance, the distinction between agriculture and industry.
In our country it con-sists not only in the fact that the conditions of labour in agriculture differ from those in indust-ry, but, mainly and chiefly, in the fact that whereas in industry we have public ownership of the means of production and of the product of industry, in agrkulture we have not public, but group, collective farm ownership.
It has already been said that this fact.
leads to the preservat-ion of commodity circulation, and that only when this distinction between industry and agri-culture disappears, can commodity production with all its attendant consequences also disap-pear.
It therefore cannot be denied that the dis-appearance of this essential distinction between agriculture and industry must be a matter of paramount importance for us.
The same must be said of the problem of · the abolition of the essential distinction between mental labour and physical labour.
It .
too is a problem of paramount importance for us.
Before the socialist emulation movement assumed mass proportions, the growth of our industry proceed-ed very haltingly, and many comrades even sug-gested that the rate ·of industrial development should be retarded.
This was due chiefly to the fact that the cultural and technical !eve"! Of the workers was too low and lagged far behind that of the technical personnel.
But the situation changed radically when the socialist emulation movement assumed a mass character.
It was from that moment on that industry began to ad-vance at accelerated speed.
Why did socialist omulation assume the character of a mass move-ment? Because among the workers whole groups ()f comrades came to the fore who had not only mastered the minimum requirements of technical knowledge, but had gone further and risen tothe level of tl1e technical personnel; they began to correct tecfrnici<ins <md engineers, to break down the existing norms a.
c; :rntiquated, to intro-clucE' new and fll(lrf' up-to·daH: norms, and so lHl.
Wlrnt slloulcl \\(' ll<t\.
<' 11 HI if not onlv iso-l<1tcd gn•ups, !nit Lii(' nw1(•r1t\· of the workers had raisE'cl their cultural ;rnd tPchnical level to that of the engineering ancl technical personnel? Our industry would have risen to a height unat-tainable by industry in other countries.
It there-fore cannot be denied that the abolition of the essential distinction between mental and physical labour by raising the cultural and technical level of the workers to that of the technical person-nel cannot but be of paramount importance to us.
Some comrades assert that .
in the course of time not only will the essential distinction be-tween industry and agriculture, and between phy-sical and me·ntal labour, disappear, .
but so will all distinction between them.
That is not true.
Abolition of the essential distincflon between in-dustry and agriculture cannot lead to to the.
abo-lition of all distinction between them.
Some dis-tinction, even if inessential, will certainly re-main, owing to the difference between the con-ditions of work in industry and and in agricult-ure.
Even in industry the conditions of labour are not the same in all its branches: the con-ditions of labour, for example, of coal miners differ from those of the workers of a mechan-ized shoe factory, and the conditions of labour of ore miners from those of engineering work-ers.
If that is so, then all the more must a cer-tain distinction remain between industry and ag-riculture.
The same must be said of the distinction between mental and physical labour.
The es-sential distinction between them, the difference in their cultural and technical levels, will cer-tainly disappear.
But some distinction, even if inessential, will remain.
If only because the con-:-ditions of labour of the managerial staffs and those of the workers are not identical.
The comrades who assert the contrary do so .
presumably on the basis of the formulatiop ·given in some of my statements, which speaks of the abolition of the distinction between in-dustry and agriculture-, and between mental and physical labour, without any reservation to the f'ffect that what is meant is the abolition of the essential distinction, not of all distinction.
That is exactly how the comrades understood my formulation, assuming that it implied the abolition of all distinction.
But this indicates that the formulation was unprecise, unsatisfact-ory.
It must be discarded and replaced by an-other formulation, one that speaks of the abo-1i ti on of essential distinctions and the persist-ence of inessential distinctions between industry and agriculture, and between mental and physic-al labour.

DISINTEGRATION OF THE SINGLE WORLD MARKET AND DEEPENING OF THE CRISIS OF THE WORLD CAP IT AUST SYSTEM The disintegration of the single all-em-bracing world market must be regarded as the most important f'.
Conomic sequel of the Second World War and of its economic consequences.
It has had the effect of further deepening the gen-eral crisis of the world capitalist system.
The Second World War was itself a product of this crisis.
Each of th(' two capitalist coal-itions which locked horns in the war calculated on defeating its adversary and .
gaining world· su-premacy.
It was in this that they sought a way out of the crisis.
The United States of America hoped to put its most dangero.
us cot'np~.
titors, Germany and ] apan, out of action, seize foreign markets and the world's raw material resources, and establish its world supremacy.
But the war did not justify these hopes.
It is true that Germany and Japan were· put out of action as competitors of the three maj~r cap-italist countries: the U.
S.
A.
, Great Britain and France.
But at the same time China and other, European, people's democracies broke away from the capitalist system and, together with the So-viet Union, formed a united and· powerful social-ist camp confronting the camp of capitalism.
The economic consequence of the existence of two opposite camps was that the single Qll-em-bracing world market disintegrated, so that now we have two parallel world markets, also con-fronting one another.
It should be.
observed that the U.
S.
A.
, Gr-eat Britain and France, themselves contributed -without themselves desiring it, of course -to the formation and consolidation of the new, pa-rallel world market.
They imposed an economic blockade on the U.
S.
S.
R.
, China and the Europ-rnn people's democracies, which did not join the "Marshall plan" system, thinking thereby Lo strangle them.
The effect, however, was not to strangle, but to strengthen the new world mar-ket.
But the fundamental thing, of course, is ·not the economic blockade, but the fact that since the war these countries have joined to-gether economically and established economic co-operation and mutual assistance.
The experience of this co:.
.
operation sho.
ws that not a single cap-italist country could have rendered such effect-ive and technically competent assistance· to the People's Democracies as the Soviet Union is ren-dering them.
· The point is not only that this as-sistance is the cheapest possible and technically superb.
The chief point is that at the bottom of this co-ope·ration lies a sincere desire to help one another and to promote the economic pro-gress of all.
The result is a fast pace of indust-rial development in these countries.
It may be confidently said that, with this pace of indust-rial development, it will soon come to pass thot these countries will not only be in no need of imports from capitalist countries, but will feel lhPmselves, the necessity Of finding an outsid<· Imarket for their surplus products.
But it follows from tl1is that the sphere of exploitation of the world's resources hy the mC1-jor capitalist countries (U.
S.
A.
, Britain, !·.
ranee) will not expand, but contrnct; that their op-portunities for sale in the world market will de-teriorate, and thQ.
t thf'ir industries will be op-erating more and more below capacity.
That, in fact is what is meant by the deepening of the ' .
.
general crisis of the world capitalist system in connection with the disintegration of the world market.
This is felt by the capitalists themselves, for it would be difficult for them not to· feel the Joss of such markets ns the U.
S.
S.
R.
and China.
They ·;1re trying to offset these difficult-.
,, .
K ies with the ''Marshall plan, the.
war In _ orea, frantic rcarm;unent and industrial militarization.
But that is very much likl' a drowning man clutching at a straw.
This state of affairs has confronted the ec-onomists with two questions: a) Can it be affirmed that the thes,is ex-pounded by Stalin before the Second World War regarding the relative stability of mark~ts in the period of the general crisis of capitalism is still valid? b) Can it be affirmed that the thesis ex-pounded by Lenin in the spring of 19.
16 ~ -na~e­ ly, that, in spite of the decay of cap1tahsm, .
on the whole, capitalism is growing far more rapid-ly than before" -is still valid? · I think that it cannot.
In view of the new conditions to which the Second World War has given rise, both these theses must be regarded as having lost their validity.

INEVITABILITY OF WARS BETWEEN ITALJST COUNTRIES CAP-Some comrndes hold that, owing to the de-' v<'lnpment of new international conditions since 1 l1P Second World War, wars between capitalist niunt ries have ceased to be inevitable.
They con~ o.
;ider that the contrnclictions between the social-ist camp and the capitalist camp are more C1cute than the contradictions among the capital-ist countries; that the U.
S.
A.
has brought the other capitalist countries sufficiently under its swav to be able to prevent them going to war Dm~ng themselves and weakening one another; that the foremost capitalist minds have been sufficiently taught by the two world wars and the severe damage they caused to the whole capitalist world not to venture to involve the capitalist countries in war with one another :1g;1in -and that, because of all this, wars be-1 ween capitalist countries are no longer inevit-;d)le.
• These comrades are mistaken.
They see the outward phenomena that come and go on the surface, but they do not see those profo~nd forces which, although they are so far operatrng imperceptibly, will nevertheless determine the course of developmen~s.
Ouwardly, everything would seem to be "go-ing well": the U.
S.
A.
has put Western Europe,] a-pan and other capitalist countries on rations; Germany (Western), Britain, France, Italy and Ja-pan ha~e fall<'il into the clutches of the U.
S.
A.
and are meeklv obeying its commands.
But it would be misL\ken to think that things can con-tinue to "go well" for ''c1ll et(·rnitv," that these countries will tolerate llw domin;it ion and op-pression of the United Stat<·s rn<llessly, th;it they will not endeavour to t<'<ff loose from Am-erican bondage and take the p~ith of independent development.
Take, first of 811, 11ritain ahcl France.
· Un-doubtedly, they are imperialist countries.
Un-doubtedly, cheap raw materials and secure mar-kc·t s are of pnrnmount import<rnce to them.
Can it be assumed that they will endlessly tolerate the present situntion, in which, under the guise of "Marshall plrn1 nid," AmC'ricans are penetrat-ing into the economies of Britain and France and trying t() convert tlwm into adjuncts .
of the l lnitPcl States f'cnnomv, ;incl American capital is sei?ing r;_iw 111;1tf'ri;1ls ;me! m:irkets in the British rnHI French colo11ics and t lwrcliy plot ting disast-er !or the hi~~h profits of the nritish and French c;1pitalists? Would it not be truer to say that capitalist Britain, and, after her, capitalist Fran-ce, will be compelled in the end to break from the embrace of the U.
S.
A.
and enter into con-flict with it in order to secure an independent position and, of course, high profits? Let us pass to the major, vanquished count-ries, Germany (Western) and Japan.
Thf's<' count-ries are now languishing in misery undC'r the jackboot of American im,perialism.
Their industry <rnd agriculture, their trade, their foreign and home policies, and their whole life are fettered by the American occupation "regime.
" Yet only yesterday these countries were great imperialist powers and were shaking the foundations of the domination of Britain, the U.
S.
A.
and France in Europe and Asia.
To think that these countries will not try to get on their feet again, will not try to smash the American "regime," and force ·their way to independent development, is to be-1ieve in miracles.
It is said that ·the contradictions between <"<1pitalism and socialism are stronger thnn the <·ontradictions among the capitalist countries.
I l1orcticallv, of course, that is true.
It is not on-! 1.
true now, today; it was true before t lie Sec-.
'11<1 World W;ir.
And it wns more or l<·ss real-i 11·d by the l<'<ldcrs of the capitalist countries.
Y1't the Sec(lnd World War began not ;1s n war \\'ith the U.
S.
S.
R.
, but as a war between capital--isl countries.
Why? Firstly, because w:ir witl· the U.
S.
S.
R.
, as a socialist land, is more danger-11us to capitalism than war between capitalist countries; for whereas war between e<lpi ta lie: countries puts in question only the supremacy of certain capitalist countries over others, war with the U.
S.
S.
R.
must certainly put in question the existence of capitalism itself.
Secondly, be-c~1use the capitalists, although they clamour, for"propaganda" purposes, about tlic ;_1ggressivcrwss of t ht' Soviet Union, clo not I lwmsclves bel i('V(' that it is aggressive, b0caus<' tlwy ;ire 3W<lf(' of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy und know that it will not' itself attnck capitalist countries.
After the first World War it was similarly believed that Germany had been definitely put out of action, just as certain comrades now be-l icve that Japan and Germany have been defin-itely put out of action.
Then, too, it was said and clamoured in the press that the United States h<icl put Europe on rations; that Germany would never risP to her feet again, and that there would h•' no more w;irs between capitalist countri<>s.
In ~'pilf' of this, Germany rose to her f('<'t :1g<lin as :1 grc;1t pown within the sp;1ce of sonw fift<'<'ll or twcntv )'f':1rs :1ftcr her defeat, having broken out of bond<1gc and taken the path of independent development.
And it is sig-nificant that it was none other than Britain and the United States that helped Germany to re-cover economically, and to enhance her econom-ic war potential.
Of course, when the United States and Britain assisted Germany's economic recovery, they did so with a view to setting a recovered Germany against the Soviet Union, to utilizing her against the land of socialism.
But Germany directed her forces in the first.
place against the Anglo-French-American bloc.
And when Hitler Germany declared war on the So-viet Union, the Anglo-French-American bloc, far from joining with Hitler Germany, was com-pelled to enter into a coalition with the U.
S.
S.
R.
against Hitler Germany.
Consequently, the struggle of the capitalist countries for markets and their desire to crush their competitors proved.
in practice to be str-on_ger than the contradictions between the capit-c1l1st camp and the socialist camp.
What guarantee .
is there, then, that Gcr-n~any ?nd J<1pan will ·not rise to their feet a~­ rnn, will not attempt to break out of Americ~T,, bon~age and live their own independent lives.
l think there is no such guarantee.
.
But it follows from this that the inevitabil-1ty of wars between capitalist countries remains ·in force.
.
_It i~ said that Lenin's thesis that imperial-ism rnev1tably generates war must now be re-g<1rcled as obsolete, since powerful popular for-cPs have come forward today, in defence of peace and against another world war.
That is not true.
The object of the present day peace move-ment is to rouse the masses of the people to fight for the preservation of peace and for the preve~tion of .
another world war.
Consequently, the aim of this movement is not to overthrow capitalism and establish socialism -it confines its<>lf to the democratic aim of preserving pea-ce.
In this respect, the present day peace move-ment differs from the movement of the time of 1 he First World War for the conversion of· the imperialist war into civil war, since the latter movement went farther and pursued socialist aims.
It is possible that in a definite conjuncture of circumstances the fight for peace will devel-op here or there into a-fight for socialism.
But then it will no longer be the present day peace movement; it will be a movement for the over-throw of capitalism.
What is most· likely is that the present day peace movement, as a movement for the prese:-vation of peace, will, if it succeeds, result m preventing a particular war, in its temporary postponement, in the tempora~y p~eservat10n of a particular peace, in the res1gnat1on of a bel-licose government and its suppression by another that is prepared temporarily to keep the peace.
That, of course, will be good.
Even very good.
But, all the same, it will not be enough to_ el-iminate the inevitability of wars between capital-ist countries generally.
It will not be enough, be-cause, for all the successes of the peace move-ment, imperialism will remain, continue in force -and, consequently, the inevitability of wars will also continue in force.
To eliminate the inevitability of war,.
it is necessary to abolish imperialism.

THE BASIC ECONOMIC LAWS OF MODERN CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM As you know, the question of the ?a~ic ec-onomic laws of cnpitalism and of socrnllsm a-rose several times in the course of the discus-sion.
Various views were cxpressc'd on this score, even the most fnnt ;1st ic Tnw, the m;1-jori ty of the participants in the discussion react-ed feeblv to the.
matter, and no decision on the point was indicated.
However, none of the par-ticipants denied that such.
laws exist.
Is there a basic economic law of capital-ism? Yes, there is •.
What is this law, and what are its characteristic features? The basic econ-omic law of capitalism -is such a law as deter-mines not some particular aspect or particular process of the development of capitalist product-ion, but all the principal aspects and all the principle processes of its development -one, consequently, which determines the essence of ·capitalist production, its essential nature.
Is the law of value the basic economic law of capitalism? No.
The law of value is primarily a law of commodity production.
It existed be-fore capitalism, and, like commodity production, will continue to exist after the overthrow of capitalism, as it does, for instance, in our count-ry, although, it is true, with a restricted sphere of operation.
Having a wide sphere of operation in· capitalist conditions, the law of value, of course, plays a big part in the development of capitalist production.
But not only does it ·not determine the essence of capitalist production <ind the rririciples of capitalist profit; it does not ~vcn pose these problems.
Therefore, it can-111i1 he th<? b<isic economic law of modern cap-· i l al ism.
For the same reasons, the law of com-petition and anarchy of production, or the law of uneven development of capitalism in the va-rious countries cannot be the basic economic law of capitalism either.
It is said that the law of the average rate of profit is the basic economic law of modern capitalism.
· That is not true.
Modern capitalism, monopoly capitalism, cannot content itself with the average profit, which moreover has a ten-dency to decline, in view of the increasing or-ganic composition of capital.
It is not the aver-age profit, but the maximum profit that modern monopoly capitalism demands, which it needs for more or less regular extended reproduction.
Most appropriate to the concept of a basic economic law of capitalism is the law of surplus value, the law of the origin and ·growth of cap-italist profit.
It really does determine the basic features of capitalist production .
.
But the law of surplus value is too general a law; it does not cover the problem of the highest rate of profit, ·the securing of which is a condition for the de-velopment of monopoly capitalism.
In order to fill this hiatus, the law of surplus value must be made more concrete and developed further.
in ad-aptation to the conditions of monopoly capital-ism, at the same time bearing in mind that mo-nopoly capitalism demands not any sort of prof-it, but precisely the maximum profit.
That will be the basic economic law of modern _capital-ism.
The main features and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism might be formulated roughly in this way: the securing of the maximum capitalist profit through the ex-ploitation, ruin and impoverishment of the ma-jority of the population of the given country, through the enslavemert and systematic robbery of the peoples of other countries, especially b~1ckwarcl countries, and, lastly, through warrs and militarization of the national economy, whi1 h are utilized for the obtaining of the high-est profits.
It is said that the average profit might nevertheless be regarded as quite sufficient for capitalist development under modern conditions.
That is not true.
The average profit is the low-est point of profitableness, below which capital-·ist production becomes impossible.
But it would be absurd to think thrtt, in seizing colonies, sub-jugating peoples and engineering wars, the mag-nates of modern monopoly capitalism arr· stri-ving to secure only the average profit.
Nn is not the average profit, nor yet supe; -which, as a rule, represents only a slight ac dition to the average profit -but precisely the maximum profit that is the motor of monopoly capitalism.
It is precisely the necessity of sec-uring the maximum· profits that drives monopoly c;_ipitalism 'to such risky undertakings as the en-slavement <:ind systematic plunder of colonies cine! other backward countries, the conversion of ;1 number of indepcndRnt countries into depend-('nt countries, the organization of new wars -which to the magnates of modern capirnlism is the "business" best adapted to the extrn1.
nf the maximum profit -and, lastly, attempL .
1 win world economic supremacy.
The importance of the basic economic law of capitalism consists, among other things, in the circumstance that, ·since it determines all the major phenomena in the development of the capitalist mode· of production, its booms and crises, its victor'ies and defeats, its merits and demerits the whole process of its contra-dictory development -it enables us to under-stand and explain them.
Here is one of many "striking" examples.
We are all acquainted with facts from the history and practice of capitalism illustrative of the rapid development of technology under cap-italism, when the capitalists · appear.
as the standard-bearers of the most advanced tech-niques, as revolutionaries in the development of the technique of production.
But we an" also familiar with facts of a cliff<'rcnt kind, illustr;i-tive of a halt in technical development under capitalism, when the capit<1list s appear as re-actionaries in the development of new tech-niques and not infrequently resort to hand la-bour.
How is this howling contradiction to be ex-plained? It can only be explained by the basic economic law of modern capitalism, that is, by the necessity of obtaining the maximum profit.
Capitalism is in favour of new techniques.
when they promise it the highest profit.
Capitalis'm is against new techniques, and for resort to hand labour, when · t lw new techniques do not promise the highPst pn •fit.
That is 11(111 rn<lt tC'rs st and with the basic economic law of modern capitalism.
Is there a· basic economic law of soi· ism? Yes, there is.
What are the essential l( tures and requirements 9f this law? The essent-ial features and requirements of the basic law of socialism might be formulated roughly in this way: the securing of the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising material and culturnl re-quirements of the whole of society through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques.
Consequently: instead of maximum profits -maximum satisfaction.
·of the material and cul-tural requirements of society; instead of develop-ment of production with breaks in continuity from boom to crisis ·and from crisis to boo1T1 unbroken expansion of production; instead periodic 'breaks in technical development, ac companied by destrµction of the productive for-ces of society -an unbroken process of perfect-i ng production on the basis of higher techniques.
It is said that the law of the balanced, proportionate development of the national econ-omy is the basic economic law of socialism.
That is not true.
Balanced development of the national economy and, hence, economic planning, which is a more or less faithful reflection of this law, can yield nothing by themselves, if it is not known for what purpose economic de velopment is planned, or if that purpose is n<1, clear.
The law of balanced development of thf national economy can yield the desired resul, only if there is a purpose for the sake of whicheconomic development is planned.
This purpose the law of balanced development of the national economy cannot itself provide.
Still less can ec-onomic planning provide it.
This purpose is· inher-ent in the basic economic law of socialism , in the shape of its requirements, as expounded ab-ove.
Consequently~ the law of balanced develop-ment of the national economy can operate to its full scope only if its operation rests on the basic economic law of socialism.
As to economic planning, it can achieve positive results only if two conditions are ob-served: a) if it c~rrect ly reflects the require-ments of the law of balancC'd development· of the nc:itional C'Conomy, and h) if it conforms in every way to the requirements of the basic ec-onomic law of socialism.

OTHER QUESTIONS 1.
Extra~economic coercion under feudal-ism.
Of course, extra-economic coercion did play a part in strengthening the economic 'power of the feudal landlords; however, not it, but feudal ownership of the land was the basis of feudalism.
2.
Personal property of the collective farm household.
It would be wrong to say, as the draft textbook does, that "every household in a col-lective farm has in personal use a cow, small livestock and poultry.
" Actually, as we know, it is not in personal use, but as a personal proper-ty that the collective farm household has its cow, small livestock, poultry, etc.
The expres-sion "in personal use" has evidently been taken from the "Model Rules of the Agricultural Ar-te!.
" But a mistake was made in the "Model Rul-es of the Agricultural Arte!.
" The Constitution of the U.
S.
S.
R.
, which was drafted more care-fully, puts it differently, viz.
: "Every household in a collective farm .
.
.
has as its personal property subsidiary husbandry on the plot, a dwelling house, livestock, poult-ry .
and min or agricultural implements.
" · That, of course, is correct.
It would be well, in addition, to state more particularly that _every collective farmer has as his personal property from one to · so-many cows, depending on local condi lions, so-many sheep, goats, pigs (also from-to, depending on local conditions), and an unlimited quantity of poultry (ducks, geese, hens, turkeys).
Such detailed particulars are of great im-portance for our comrades abroad, who want to know what exactly has remained as the personal property of the collective farm household now that agriculture in our country has been collect-ivized.
3.
Total rent paid by the peasants to tht landlords; also total expenditure on the purchase of land.
The draft textbook says that as a result of the nationalization of the land, "the peasant-ry were released from paying rent to the land-alords to a total of about 500 million rouhlf's an-nually," (it should be "gold" roubles).
This figure should be verified, because it seems to me that it does not include the rent paid over the whole of Russia, but only in a majority of the Russian gubernias.
It should also be borne in mind .
that in some of the border r('gions of Russia rent was paid in kind, a fact which the authors of the draft textbook have evidently overlooked.
Furthermore, it should be remembered that the peasants were released not only from the pay-ment of rent, but also from annual expenditure for the purchase of land.
Was this taken into account in the draft textbook? ·It ·seems to me that it was not; but it should have been~ 4.
Coalescence of the monopolies with the state machine.
· .
.
The word "coalescence" is not appropriate.
It superficially and descriptively notes the pro-cess of merging of the monopolies with the state, but it does not reveal the economic im-port of this process.
The fact of the matter is that the merging process is not simply a p~ocess of coalescence, but the subjugation of the state machine to the monopolies.
The word "coales-cence" should therefore be discarded and re-placed by the words "subjugatiqn of the state machine to the monopolies.
" 5.
The use of machines in the U.
S.
S.
R.
The draft textbook says that "in the U.
S.
S.
R.
machines are used in all cases· when they economize the labour of society.
" That is by no means what should be said.
In the first place, machines in the U.
S.
S.
R.
always econom-ize the labour of society, and we accordingly do not .
know of any cases when, in the U.
S.
S.
R.
, they have not economized the labour of society.
In the second place, machines not only econom-ize labour; they also lighten the labour of the worker, and accordingly, in our conditions, in contradistinction to the conditions of capitalism, the workers use machines in the processes of Ja-bour with the greatest eagerness.
It shou.
lcl therefore be said that nowhere :1r0 machines used so willingly as in t lw U.
S.
S.
-1~.
.
because they economize the lah!lur of so-ciety and lighten the labour of the worker, and, ;is there is no unemployment in tlw U.
S.
S.
R.
, 1 he workers use machines in the nnt ion;d econ-omy with tlw gn~alcsl c;igcrncss.
6.
Living standards of the work i 11g <·l:1ss in capitalist countries.
Usually, when speaking of the living stand-ards of the working class, what is meant is only the standards of employed workers, and not.
of what is known as the reserve army of unemploy-ed.
Is such an attitude to the question of .
the living standards of the working class correct? I think it.
is not.
If there is a reserve army of un-employed whose members cannot live except by the sale of their labour power, then the unem-ployed must necessarily 'orm part of the work-ing class; and if they do form part of the work-ing class, then their destitute condition cannoL but influence the living standards of the workers engaged in product.
ion.
I therefore think thatwhen describing the living standards of the work-ing class in capitalist countries, the condition of the reserve army of unemployed workers should also be taken into account.
7.
National income.
I think it · absolutely necessary to add a chapter on national income to the draft text-book.
8.
Should there be a special chapter in the textbook on Lenin and Stalin as the founders of the political economy of socialism? I think that the chapter, "The Marxist The-ory of Socialism.
Founding of the Political Econ-omy of Socialism by V.
I.
Lenin .
and J.
V.
Stalin," should be excluded from the textbook.
·It is en-tirely unnecessary, since it adds nothing, and on-ly co.
lourlessly reiterates what has already .
.
.
been said m greater detail in earlier chapters of the textbook.
: As regards the other questions, I have no remarks to make on the "Proposals" of Com-rades Ostrovityanov, Leontyev, Shepilov, · Gatov-sky, etc.
· 9.
INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF A -IAN TEXTBOOK ON POLITICAL ECONOMY I think that the comrades do not appreci-ate the importance of a Marxist textbook on po-litical economy as fully as they should.
It is needed not only by our Soviet youth.
It is par-ticularly needed by Communists and communist sympathizers in all countries.
Our comrades abroad want to know how we broke out of cap-italist slavery; how we rebui'lt the economy o: our country on socialist.
lines; how we secure, the friendship of the peasantry; how we ma nag.
ed to convert a country which was only so re-cently poverty-stricken and weak into a rich and mighty country; what are the collective farms; why, although ·the means of production are so-cialized, we do not abolish commodity product-ion, money, trade, etc.
They want to know all this, and much else, not out of mere curiositv, but in order to learn from us and to utilize o~r ·experience in their own countries.
Consequently, the appearance of a good Marxian textbook on political economy is rtot only of political import-ance at home, but also of great international im-portance.
· What is needed,.
' therefore, is a textboo: which might serve as a reference book for till: revolutionary youth not only at home, but also abroad.
It must not be too bulky, because an over-bulky textbook cannot be a reference book and is difficult to assimilate, to master.
But it must contain everything fundamental relating both to· the economy of our country and to the economy of capitalism and the colonial system.
During the discussion, some comrades pro-posed the inclusion in the textbook of a numbc1 of additional chapters: the historians -on hist-ory, the politicians -on politics, the philosoph-ers -on philosophy, the.
economists -on econom-ics.
But the effect of this would be to swel:the textbook to unwieldy dimensions.
That, of course, must not be done.
The textbook employs the historical method to illustrate problems of political economy, but that does not mean that we must turn .
a textbook on political economy into a history of-economic relations.
What we ne.
ed is a textbook of 500, at most 600 pages -not more.
That will be a re-ference book on Marxian political economy -and an excellent gift to the young Communists of all countries.
Incidentally, in view of the inadequate lev-.
el of Marxist development of the majority of the Communist parties abroad, .
such a textbook · might also be of great use to communist cadres abroad who are no longer young.
10.
WAYS OF IMPROVING THE DRAFT TEXT-BOOK ON POLITICAL ECONOMY During the discussion some comrades "ran down" the draft textbook much too assidu,ously, berated its authors for errors and oversights, and claimed that the draft was a failure.
That is unfair.
Of course, there are errors and over-sights in the textbook -they are to be found in practically every big undertaking.
Be that as it may, the overwhelming majority of the partici-pants in the discussion were nevertheless of the opinion that the draft might serve as a basis for the future textbook, and only needed certain corrections and additions.
Indeed, one has only to compare the draft with the textbooks on po-litical economy .
already in circulation to see that the draft stands head and shoulders above them.
For that the authors of the draft.
deserve .
great credit.
I think that in order to improve the draft textbook, it would be well to appoint a small committee which would include not only the au-thors of the textbook,.
and not only supporters, but also opponents of the majority of the par-ticipants in the discussion, out-and-out ci"itfcs of the draft tenbook.
It would also be well to include in the ·committee a competent statistician to verify the figures and to supply additional statistical material for the draft, as well as a competent jurist to verify the accuracy of the formul-~lt ions.
The members of the committee should be temporarily relieved of all other work and should be well provided for, so that they might devote themselves entirely to the textbook.
Furthermore, it 'would be well to appoint an editorial committee, of three persons, sqy, to take care of the final editing of the text-book.
This is necessary also in order to achieve unity of style, which, unfortunately, the draft textbook lacks.
Time limit for presentation of the finished textbook to the Central Committee -one year.

Al I the th;1L there arP otlwr CJU<'stihns which nre urgent, and which naturally deflected attention from your letter.
I shall answer point by point.
rnon· The first point.
There is a statement in the "Remarks" to the effect that society is not powerless against the laws of science, that man, having come to know economic laws, can utilize them in the in-terests of society.
You assert: that this postulate cannot be extended to other social formations that it holds good only under soc.
ialism and com~ munism, that the elemental character of the ec-onomic processes under capitalism, for example, makes it impossible for society to utilize .
econ-omic laws in the interests of society.
That is not true.
At the time of the bour-geois revolution in France, for instance, the bourgeoisie utilized against feudalism the law that rel~tions of production must necessarily con-form with the character of the productive for-~es, overthrew the feudal relations of product-~on, created new, bourgeois relations of product-ion, and brought them into conformity with the charncti~r of the productive forces which hsd arisen in the bosom of the feudal system.
The bourgeoisie did this not because of any partic-ular abilities it possessed, but because it was vi-tally interested in doing so.
The feudalists put up resistance to this not from stupidity, but be-cause they were vitally interested in preventing this law from becoming effective.
The same must ·be said of the socialist revolution in our country.
The working class ut-ilized the law that the relations of production must necessarily conform with the character of the productive forces, overthrew the bourgeois relations of production, created new' socialist relations of production and brought them into conformity with the character of the productive forces.
It was able to do so not because of any particular abilities it possessed, but because it was vitally interested in doing so.
The bourgeois-ie, which from an advanced force at the dawn of the bourgeois revolution had already bC"come a counter-revolutiona~y force, offered every re-sistance to the implementation of this law -and it did so not because it lacked organization, and not because the elemental nature of economic processes drove it to resist, but chiefly because it was to its vital interest that the law should not become operative.
Consequently: l.
Economic processes, economic laws are in one degree or another utilized in the inter-ests of society not only under socialism ancl communism, but under other formations as welL 2.
The utilization of economic laws i1soci0tv ;.

ilw;ivs rn1d ev-er\wlwre the diampion or t 111' utili1<1t ion of ec-()flOllliC laws in the interPsts of society is the cl;1'.
''; hcw~ground <1dvanccd class,,, while the obsolescent classes re-sist it.
The difference in this matter between the proletariat and the other classes · which at any time in the course of history revolutionized the relations of production consists in the fact that the class interests of the proletariat merge with the interests of the overwhelming majority of society, because proletarian revolution implies the abolition not of one or another form of ex-ploitation, but of all exploitation, while the revolutions of other classes, which abolished on-ly one or other form of exploitation, were.
con-fined within the limits of their narrow class in-terests, which conflicted with the interests of the majority of society.
The "Remarks" speak of the class back-ground of the utilization of economic laws in the interests of society.
It is stated there, that "unlike the laws of natural science, where the discovery and application of a new law proceeds more or less smoothly, the discovery and ap-plication of a new law in the economic field, af-fecting as it does the interests of obsolescent forces of society, meets with the most powerful resistance on their part.
" This point you missed.
The second point.
You assert lhat complete conformity of the relations of production with the the charact-of the productive forces can be achieved on-Iv under socialism and communism, and that un-der other formations th~ conformity can only be partial.
That is not true.
In the epoch following the bourgeois revolution, when the bourgeisie had shattered the feudal relations of production and established bourgeois relations of production, there undoubtedly were periods when the bour-geois production relations did fully conform with the character of the productive forces.
Other-wise, capitalism could not have developed as · swiftly as it did after the bourgeois revolution.
further, the words "full conformity" must not be understood fn the absolute sense.
They must not be understood as meaning that there is no lagging of the relations of production be-hind the growth of the prod.
uctive forces under socialism.
The productive forces are the most mobile and revolution~ry forces of production.
They undeniably move in advance of the re-1ations of production even under socialism.
Only after a certain lapse of time do the relations of producdon change in line with the character of the productive forces.
How, then, are the words "full conformity" to be understood? They are to be understood as meaning that under socialism things do not usual-ly go to the length of a conflict between the relations of production and the productive for-ces, that society is in a position to take timely steps to bring the lagging relations of product-Nion into conformity with the character of the productive forces.
Socialist society is in a po-sit ion to do so because it does not include ob-solescent classes that might organize resistance.
Of course, even under socialism there will be backward, inert ·forces that do not realize the necessity for changing the relations of product-ion; but they, of course, will not be difficult to overcome without bringing matters to a conflict.
The third point.
It appears from your argument that you re-gard the means of production, and, in.
the ffrst place, the implements of production produced by our nationalized enterprises, as commodities.
Can means of production be regard~d as commodities in our socialist system? In my op-inion they certainly cannot.
A commodity is a product which may be sold to any purchaser, and when its owner sells it, he loses ownership of it and the purchaser becomes the owner of the commodity, whi<;h he may resell, pledge or allow to rot.
Do means of production come within this category? They ob-viously do not.
In the first place, means of pro-duction are not "sold" to any purchaser, they are not "sold" even to collective farms; they are only allocated by the state to its enter-prises.
In the second place, when transferring menns of production to any enterprise, their owner -the state -does not at all lose the ownership of them; on the contrary, it retains 11 fully.
Jn the third place, directors of enter-prises who rPceive means of production from tile Soviet state, far from becoming their own-<'rs, are deemed to be the agents of the state 111 the utilization of the meCJns of production in ;HTordance with the pl;:ms established by the ·.
;I ;1tf~.
It will be seen, then, that under our sys-means of production can certainly not be <'l;1ssecl in the category of commodities.
Why, in that case, do we speak of the val-ue of means of production, their cost of pro-duction, their price, etc.
? For two reasons.
Firstly, this is needed for the purposes of c~1lculation and settlement, for determining whether enterprises are paying or running at a loss, for checking and controlling the enter-prises.
But th;jt is only the formal aspect of the 11i:11 ter.
Secondly, it is needed in ·order, in the in-1 nests of our foreign trade, to conduct sales of 111r·ans of production to foreign countries.
Here, in the sphere of foreign trade, but only in this c;phere, our means of production really are com-modities, and really are sold (in the direct mean-ing of the term).
It therefore follows that in the sphere of foreign trade the means of production produced by our enterprises retain the properties of com-modities both essentially and formally, but ~hat in the sphere of domestic economic circulation, rneans of product i()n lose the properties of com-t <'mmodities, ceose to be commodities and pass out of the sphere of operation of the law of value, retaining only the outw.
ard integument of com-modit ic.
: (calcul;u ion, etc.
).
How is this peculiurity to be explained? The fact of the matt er is th<.
H in our so-cialist conditions economic development proceeds not by way of upheavals, but by way of gradual changes, the old not simply being abolished out of hand, but changing its n;1t ure in adaptation to the new, and retaining only its form; while the new does not simply destroy the old, but in-filtrates into it, ch8nges its nature and its functions, without smashing its form, but util-izing it for the development of the new.
This, in our economic circulation, is true not only of commodities, but also of money, as well as of banks, which, while they lose thefr old functions and acquire new ones, preserve their old form, which is utilized by the socialist system.
If the matter is approached from the form-al angle, from the angle of the processes taking place on the surface of phenonwna, one may ar-rive at the incorrect conclusion thot the 'c<1tf'-gories of capitalism retain their validity under our economy.
If, however, the matter is ap-proached from the standpoint of Marxist an-alysis, which strictly distinguishes between the substance of an economic process and its form, between the deep processes of development and the surface phenomena, one comes to the only correct conclusion, namely, that it is chiefly the form, the outward appearance, of the old cate-gories of capitalism that have remained in our country, but that their essence has radically <'hanged in adaptation to the requirements of the development of the socialist economy.
The fourth point.
You assert that the law of value exercises a regulating influence on the prices of the "means of production" produced by agriculture nnd delivered to the state at the procurement prices.
You refer to such "means of production" as raw materials -cotton, for instance.
You .
might have added flax, wool and other agricult-ural raw materials.
It should first of all be observed that in this case it is not "means of production" that agriculture produces, but only one of the means of production -raw materials.
The words "mea-ns of production" should not be juggled with.
When Marxists speak of the pFOduction of means of production, what they primarily have in mind is the production of implements of production, what Marx calls "the instruments of labour, those of a.
mechanical nature, which, taken as a whole, we may call· the bone and muscles of production," which constitute the "characteristics 1 of a given ·epoch of production.
11 To equate a part of the means of production (raw materials) with the means of production, including the im-plements of production, is to sin against Marx-ism, because Marxism considers that the im-plements of production play a decisive role com-pared with all other means of 'production.
Every-one knows that, by themselves, raw materials cannot produce implem~nts of production, al-though certain kinds of raw material are neces-sary for the production of implements of pro-duction, while no raw material can be produced without implements of production.
Further, is the influence of the law of val-ue .
on the price of raw materials produced by agriculture a regulating influence, as ·you, Com-rade Nbtkin, claim? It· would be a regulating one, if prices of agricultural raw materials had "free" play in our country, if the law of com-petition and anarchy of production prevailed, .
if we did not have a planned economy, and if the production of raw materials were not regulated by plan.
But since all these "ifs" .
are missing in our economic system, the influence of the law of value on the price of agricultural raw mater-ials cannot be a regulating.
one.
In the first place, in our country prices of agricultural raw materials are fixed, established by plan, and are not "free.
" In the second place,.
the quantities of agricultural raw materials produced are not determined spontaneously or by chance elements, but by plan.
In the third place, the implements of production needed for the producing of agri-cultural raw materials are concentrated not in the hands of individuals, or groups of individ-uals, but in the hands of the state.
What then, after this, remains of the r<'gul;1ting !'unction of the law of value? It appears that the law of val-ue is itsE'lf reguluted by thr above-mentioned r:ictors characteristic of .
socialist production.
Consequently 1 it cannot be denied that the I <tW of value does influence the formation of prices of agricultural ra'Y materials, that it is rlllC of the factors in this process.
But still less c:m it be denied that its influence is not, and ,·;rnnot be, a regulating one.
The fifth point.
When speaking, in my "Remarks," of the rrofitableness of the socialist national economy, I was controverting certain comrades who allege tlrnt, by not giving great preference to profit-<1ble enterprises, and by tolerating the existence side by side with them of unprofitable enter-prises, our planned economy is killing the ver~ principle of profitableness of economic under-t<1kings.
The "Remarks" say that profitableness considered from the standpoint of individual plants or industries is beneath all comparison with that higher form of profitableness which we get from our socialist mode of producti~rn, which saves us from crises of overproduct10n and ensures· us a continuous expansion of pro-duction.
But it would be mistaken to conclude from this that the profitableness of individual plants <1nd industries is of no ·particular value and is not deserving of serious attention.
That, of course, is not true.
The profitableness of individ-ual plants and industries is of immense value for the development of our industry.
It must be.
taken into account both when planning construct-ion and when planning production.
It is an el-ementary requirement of our economic activity at the present stage of development.
The sixth point.
It is not clear how your words "extended production in strongly deformed guise" in ref er-ence to capitalism are to be understood.
It should be said that such.
production, and extend-ed production, at that, does not occur in nature.
It is evident.
that, after the world market has split, and the sphere of exploitation of the world's resources by the major capitalist count-ries (U.
S.
A.
, Britain, France) has begun to con-tract, the cyclical character of the development of capitalism -expansion and contraction of pro-duction -must continue to operate.
However, ex-pansion of production in these countries will pro-ceed on a narrower basis, since the volume of production in these countries will diminish.

YAROSHENKO Some time ago the members of the Politic-al Bureau of the C.
C.
, C.
P.
S.
U.
(B.
) received a letter from Comrade Yaroshenko, dated March 20, 1952, on a number of economic questions which were debated at the November discussion.
The author of the letter complains that the ba-.
sic documents summing up the discussion, nnd Comrade Stalin's "Remarks," "contain no reflect-ion whatever of the opinion" of Comrnde Yaro-shenko.
Comrade Yaroshenko :.
:ilso suggests in.
his note that he should be allowed to write a "Po-~itical Economy ·of Socialism," to be completed m a year or a )'ear and a half, and that he should be given two assistants to help him in the work.
I think that both Comrade Yaroshef.
lko's complaint and his proposal need to be examined on their merits.
Let us h<'gin with the complaint.
Well, then, what is l 11(' '\ipinion" of Com-rade Yaroshenko which has received no reflect-ion whatever in the above-rncnl ioned documents? COMRADE Y AROSHENKO'S CHIEF ERROR To describe Comrade Yaroshenko's· opinion in a couple of words, it should be said that it is un-Marxian -and, hence, profoundly erron-eous.
Comrade Yaroshenko's chief error is that he forsakes the Marxist position on the question of the role of the productive forces and of the r~lations of production in the development of so-ciety, that he inordinately overrates the role of the productive forces, and just.
as inordinately underrates the role of the relations of product-ion, and ends up by declaring that under social-ic.
;m the relations of production are a component p:1rt of the produotive forces.
Comrade Yaroshenko is prepared to grant 1 lw relations of productiqn a certain role under t lw conditions of "antagonistic class .
contra-dictions," inasmuch as there the relations of pro-duction "run counter to the development of the productive forces.
" But he confines it to a pure_-lv negative role, the role of a factor which re .
.
t <1rds the development bf the productive forces, which fetters their development.
Any.
other functions, positive functions, of the relations of production, Comrade Yaroshenko fails to see.
As to the socialist system, where "antagon-istic class contradictions" no longer exist, and where the relations of production "no longer run counter to the development Of the productive lorces," here, according to Comrade Yaroshenko, t lie relations of production lose every vestige of :111 independent role, they cease to be a serious L1ctor of development, and are absorbed by the productive forces, becoming a component part of them.
Under social_ism, Comrade Yaroshenko says, "men's production relations become part.
of the organization of the productive forces, as a means, an element of their organization.
" (Com-rade Yaroshenko's letter to the Political Bureau of the C.
C.
) If that is so, what is the chief task of a "Political Economy of Socialism"? Comrade Yaro-shenko replies: "The chief problem of the "Po-1it ical Economy of Socialism," therefore, is not to investigate the relations of production of themembers of socialist society; it is .
to elaborate and develop a scientific theory of the organizat-ion of the productive forces in social product-ion, a theory of the planning of economic devel-opment.
" (Comrade Yaroshenko's speech at the Plenary Discussion.
) That, in fact 1 explains why Comrade Yaro-shenko is not interested in such economic quest-ions of the socialist system as the existence of different forms.
of property in our economy, commodity circulation, the law of value, etc.
, which he believes to be minor questions that on-ly give rise to scholastic disputes.
He plainly de-clares that in his "Political Economy of Social-• II "d" ism, 1sputes as to t he role of any particular category of socialist political economy -value, commodity, money, credit, etc.
, -which very of-ten with us are of a scholastic character; are replaced by a healthy discussion of the rational organization of the productive forces in social production, by a scientific demonstration of the validity of such organization.
" (Comrade Yaro-shenko's speech in the Discussion Working Pan-el.
) · In short, political economy without econom-ic problems.
Comrade Yaroshenko thinks that it is en-ough to arrange a "rational organization of the productive forces," and the transition from so-cialism to communism will take place without any particular difficulty.
He considers that this is quite sufficient for the transition to commun-ism.
He plainly declares that "under socialism, the basic struggle for the building of a commun-ist society reduces itself to a struggle for th· proper org;inization of the productive forces a11 1 licir rali!•nal utilization in social production.
'' t'->p<'!Th a1 tile Plenary Discussion.
) Comrade 1 <mishenko solemnly proclaims tha,t "Communism i:-; the highest scientific organization of the pro-d1ictive forces in social production.
" It appears, then, that the essence of the communist system begins and ends with the "rntional organization of the productive forces.
" from all this, Comrade Yaroshenko con-cludes that there cannot be a single Political Ee-.
onomy for all social formations, that there must be two political economies: one for pre-socialist social formations, the· subject of investigation of which is men's relations of production, and the other for· the socialist system, the subject of 1: vestigation of which should be not the product-ion, i.
e.
, the economic, relations, but the ration-<ll organization of the pro<Juctive forces.
Such Is the opinion of Comrade Yaro-shenko.
What can be said of this opinion? It is 'not true, in the first place, that the role of ·the relations of production in the history of society has been confined to that of a brake,· a fetter on the development of the productive forces.
When Marxists speak of the retarding role of the relations of production, it is not all relations of production they have in mind, but only the old relations of production, which no longer conform to the growth of the productiveforces and, consequently, retard their develop-ment.
But, as we know, besides the old, there are also new relations of production, which su-persede the old.
Can it be said that the role of the new relations of production is that of a brake on the productive forces? No, it cannot.
On the contrary, the new relations.
of production are the chief and decisive force, the one which in fact determines the further, and, moreover, powerful development of the productive forces, and without which the latter would be doomed to stagnation, as is the case today in the cap-italist countries.
Nobody can deny that .
the · development of the productive forces of our Soviet industry has made tremendous strides in the period · of the five-year plans.
But this development would not have occurred if we had not, in October 1917, replaced the old, capitalist relations of product-ion by new, socialist relations of production.
Without this revolution in the production, the economic, relations of our country, our product-ive forces would have stagnated, just as .
they are stagnating today in the capitalist countries.
Nobody can deny that the development · of the productive forces of our agriculture has made tremendous strides in the past twenty or twenty-five years.
But this development would not have occurred if we had not, in the thirties, replaced the old, capitalist production relaUons in the countryside by new, collectivist product-ion relations.
Without this revolution in product-ion, the productive force~ of our agriculure would have stagnated, just as they are stag-n<lting today in the capitalist countries.
Of course, new relations of production ca1i not, and do not, remain .
new forever; they begin to grow old and to run counter to the further development of the productive forces; they be-gin to lose their role of principal mainspring of the productive forces, .
and become a brake on them.
At this point, in place of these product-ion relations which have become antiquated,.
new production relations appear whose role it is to be the principal mainspring spurring .
the further development of the productive forces.
This peculiar development of the relations of production from the role of a brake on the productive forces to that of the principal main-spring impelling them ·forward, and from the role of p'rincipal mainspring to that of a brake on the productive forces, constitutes one of the chief elements of the Marxian materialist dial-ectics.
Every novice in Marxistn knows that now-adays.
But Comrade.
Yaroshenko, it appears, does not know it.
It is hot true, in the second place, th'at the production, i.
e.
, the economic, relations lose their in.
dependent role under socialism, that they are absorbed by the productive forces, that so-cial production under socialism is reduced to '' organization of the productive forces.
Marxism regards social production as an integral wh?le which has two inseperable sides: the productive forces of society (the relation of society to the forces of nature, in contest with which it sec-ures the material values it needs), .
and the re-lations of production (the relations of men to one another in the process of production).
These are two different sides of social production, al-.
though they are inseparably connected with one another.
And just because they constitute differ-ent sides of social production, they are able to influence one another.
To assert that one of these sides may be absorbed by the other and be converted into its component part, is to com-mit a very grave sin against Marxism.
Marx said: In production · men not only act on nature but also on one another.
They .
produce only by co-operating in a certain way and mutually ex-changing their activities.
In order to produce, they enter into definite connections and re-lations with one another and only within these social connections and relations does their act-ion on nature take place.
" (K.
Marx and f.
En-gels, Vol.
V, p.
429.
) Consequently, social production consists of two sides, which, although they are insep~rably connected, reflect two different categories of relations: the relations of men to nature (pro-ductive forces), and the relations of men to one another in the process of production (production relations).
Only when both sides of production are pre~ent do we have social production, whether it be under the socialist system or un-der any other social formation.
Comrade Yaroshenko, evidently, is not quite in agreement with Marx.
He considers that this postulate of Marx is not applicable to the soc'ialist system.
Precisely for this reason he re-duces the problem of the Political Economy of Socialism to the rational .
organization of the µ1 · rluctive forces, discarding the production, the ec-onomic, relations and severing the productive f nr('PS from them.
If we fqlfowed Comrade Yaroshenko, there-'' ire, what we would get is, instead of a Marx~ i:in Politic;tl Economy, something in the nature of nogdanov's "Universal Organizing Science.
" Hence, starting from the right idea that the productive forces are the most mobile and rTvolutionary forces of production, Comrade Yaroshenko reduces the idea to an absurdity, to the point of denying the role of the production, the economic, relations under socialism; and in-stead of ·a full-blooded social production, what he gets is a lopsided and scraggy technology of production -something in the nature of Bukhar-in's "technique of social organiiation.
" Marx says: "Jn the social production of their life (that is, in the production o' the material valii necessary tb the life of men -J.
St.
), men en' into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of product-ion which correspond to a definite stage of de-velopment of their material productive forces.
The sum total of these relations of production constitute the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which corresponf1I definite forms of social consciousness.
" ("A Con-.
tribution to the Critique of Political Economy" -Preface.
) This means that every social formation, so-cialist society .
not excluded, has its economic foundation, coris,isting of the sum total of men's relations of production.
What, one asks, happens to the economic foundation of the socialist sys-tem with Comrade Yaroshenko? As we know, Comrade Yaroshenko has already done away with relations of production under socialism as a more or less independent sphere, and has in-cluded the little that remains of them in the or-ganization of the productive forces.
Has the .
so-cialist system, one asks, its own economic foun-dation? Obviously, seeing that the relations of production have disappeared as a more or less independent factor under socialism, the socialist system is left without an economic foundation.
In short, a socialist system without an ec-onomic foundation.
A rather funny situation .
.
.
Is a social system without an economic foundation possible at all? Comrade Yaroshenko evidently believes that it is.
Marxism, however, believes that such social systems do not occur in nature.
It is not true, lastly, that communism means the rational organization of the product-ive forces, that the rational organization of the productive forces is the beginning and end of the communist system, that it is only necessary to organize the productive forces rationally, and the transition to communism will take place w1Lhout particular difficulty.
There is in our lit-Prature another.
definition, another formula of communism -Lenin's formula: "Communism is Soviet rule plus the el~ctrification of the whole country.
" Lenin's formula is evidently not to Comrade Yaroshenko's liking, and he replaces it with his own homemade formula: "Communism is the highest scientific organization of the pro-ductive forces in social production.
" In the first place, nobody knows what this "higher scientific" or "rational" organization of the productive forces.
which Comrade Yaro-shenko advertises represents, what its concrete import is.
In his speeches at.
the .
Plenum ~nd i.
n the working panels of the d1scuss10n, and m his Jr~tter to the members of the Political Bureau, Comrade Yaroshenko reiterates this mythical formula dozens of times, but nowhere does he say a single word ·to explain .
how the "ratio~al organization" of the productive forces, which supposedly constitutes the beginning and e~d of the essence of the communist system, shn11i' 1 understood.
In the second place, if a choice must l)• made between the two formulas, then it is not Lenin's formula, which is the only correct one, that should be discarded, but Comrade Yaro-shenko's pseudo-formula, which is so obviously chimerical and un-Marxian, and is borrowed from the arsenal of Bogdanov, from his "Uni--versa! Organizing Science.
" Comrade Yaroshenko thinks that we have only to ensure a rational organization of theproductive forces, and we shail be able to .
ob-tain an abundance of products and to pass to communism, to pass from the formula, "to each according to his work," ·to the formula, "to each according to his needs.
" That is a profound er-ror, and reveals.
a complete lack of understand-ing of the laws of economic development of so-cialism.
Comrade Yaroshenko's conception of the conditions for the transition from· socialism to communism is far too rudimentary and puerile.
He does not understand .
that neither an abund-ance of products, capable of covering all the requirements of society, nor the transition to the formula "t,o each according to his needs," can be brought about if such economic factors as collective farm, group, property, commodity circulation, etc.
, remain in force.
Comrade Yaro-shenko does not understand that before we can pass to the formula, "to each according to his needs," we shall have to pass through a number of stages of economic and cultural re-education of society, in the course of which work will be transformed in the eyes of society from only a means of supporting life into life's prime want, and social property into the sacred and inviol-able basis of the existence of society.
In order to pave the way for a real, and not declaratory transition to communism, at least three main preliminary conditions have to be satisfied.
1.
It is necessary, in the first place, to en-sure, not a mythical "rational organization" of the productive forces, but a continuous expan-sion of all social production, with a relatively higher rate oi ex:pan$ion of the production of means of production.
The relatively higher ra~e of expansion of production of means of product-ion is necessary not only because it has to pro-vide the equipment both for its own plants and for all the other branches of the national econ-omy, but also because reproduction on an extend-ed scale becomes .
altogether impossible without it.
2.
It is necessary, in the second place, by means of gradual transitions carried out to the advantage of the collective farms, and, hence, ·of all society, to raise collective form property to the level of public.
property, and, also by means of gradual tr"ansitions, to replace com-modity circulation by a system of products-ex-change, tinder which the central government, or some other social-economic centre, might con-trol the whole product of social production to the interests of society.
· Comrade Yarashenko is mistaken when he asserts that there is no contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces of society under socialism.
Of course, our present· relations of production are in a period when they fully conform to the growth of the productive forces and help to advance them at seven-league strides.
But it would be wrong to rest easy at that and to think that there are no contradictions between our productive forces and the relations of production.
There certainly are, and will be, contradictions, seeing that the de-velopment of the relations of production lags, and will lag, behind the development of the pro-ductive forces.
Given a correct policy on the part of the directing bodies, these contradictions cannot grow into antagonisms, and there is no chance of matMrs coming to a conflict between the relations of .
production and the productive forces of society.
It would be a · different mat-ter if we were to conduct a wrong policy, such as that which Comrade Yaroshenko recommends.
In that case conflict would be inevitable, and our relations of production might become a se-rious brake on the further development of the · productive forces.
· The task of the directing bodies is there-fore promptly to discern incipient contradictions, and to toke timely measures to resolve them by adapting the relations of production to the grow-th of the productive forces.
This, above all, con-cerns such economic factors as group, or collect-ive farm, property and commodity circulation.
At present, of course, these factors are being successfully utilized by us for the promotion of the socialist economy, and they are of un-deniable benefit to our society.
It is undeniable, too, that they will be of benefit also in the near future.
But it would be unpardonable blind-ness not to see at the same time that these fac-tors are already beginning to hamper the power-ful development of our productive forces, since they create obstacles to the full extension of government planning to the whole of the nation-doubt that these factors will hamper the con-tinued growth of the productive forces of our country more and more as time goes on.
The task therefore is to eliminate these contradict-ions by gradually converting collective farm property into public property, and by introducing -also gradually -products-exchange in place pf commodity Circulation.
3.
It is necessary, in the third place, to en-sure such a cultural advancement of society as will secure for all members of society the all-round development of their physical and mental abilities, so that the members of society may ·be in a position to receive an education suf-ficient to enable them to be active agents of social development, and in a position freely to choose their occupations and not be tied all their lives, owing to the existing division of la-bour, to some one occupation.
What is required fo'r this? It would be wrong to think that such a substantial advance in the cultural standard of the members of society can be brought about without substantial changes in the present st~tus of labour.
·for this, it is necessary, first of all, to shorten the working day at least to six, and subsequently to five hours.
This is needed in or-der that the members of society might have the necessary free time to receive an all-round · edu-cation.
It is necessary, further, to introduce uni-versal compulsory polytechnical education, which is required in order that the members of society might be freely able to choose their occupationsand not be tied to some one occupation all their lives.
It is likewise necessary that housing conditions should be radically improved, and that real wages of workers and employees should be at least doubled, if not more, both by means of direct increases.
of wages and salaries, and, more especially, by further systematic reduct-ions of prices for consumer goods .
.
These are the basic conditions required to pave the way for the transition to communism.
Only after all these preliminary conditions are satisfied in their entirety may it be hoped that work will be converted in the eyes of the members of society from a nuisance into "life's prime want" (Marx), that "labour will become a pleasure instead of a burden" (Engels), and that social property will be regarded by all members of society as the sacred and inviolable basis of the existence of society.
Only after all these preliminary conditions have been satisfied in their entirety will it be possible to pass from the socialist formula, "from each according to his ability, to each ac-cording to his work," to the communist for"mula, "from each according to his ability, to each ac-cording to his needs.
" This will be a radical transition from one form of economy, the economy of socialism, to another.
, higher form of economy, the economy of communism.
As we see, the transition from socialism to communism is not such a simple matter as Comrade Yaroshenko imagines.
To attempt to reduce this complex and 111u1 ti form process, which demands deep-going ec-onomic changes, ·to the "rational organization of 1 he productive forces," as Comrade Yaroshenko <loes, is to substitute Bogdanovism for Marxism.
II • OTHER ERRORS OF COMRADE YAROSHENKO.
I.
From his incorrect opinion, Comrade Yaroshenko draws incorrect conclusions relative to the character and province of political econ-.
oniy.
Comrade Yaroshenko denies the necessity for a single political .
economy for all social for-mations, on the grounds that every social for-mation has its specific economic laws.
But he is absolutely wrong there, and is at variance with such Marxists as Engels and Lenin.
Engels says that political economy is "the--science of the conditions and forms under which the various human societies have produced and exchanged and on this basis have distributed their products.
" ("Anti-Dohring.
") Hence,.
political economy investigates the laws of economic de-velopment not of any one social formation, but of the various social formations.
With this, as we know, Lenin was in full :1greement.
In his critical comments on Bukhar-in's "Economics of the Transition Period,n he said that Bukharin was wrong in restricting the province of political economy to commodity pro-.
duct ion, and above all to capit :dist production, observing that in doing so Bukh;1rin was taking "a step backward from Engels.
" fully.
in conformit_v with this is the ddin-ition of political economy given in the ·draft textbook, when it says that political economy is the science which studies "the laws of the so-cial production and distribution of material val-ues at the various stages of development of hu-man society.
" That is understandable.
The various social formations are governed in their economic devel-opment not only by their own specific economic laws, but also by the economic laws that are common to all format ions, such as, for instance, the law that the procluctivP forces 8ncl the re-lations of production are uni tcd in one integral social production, and the law governing the re-lations between the productive fotces and the relations of production in the .
process of develop-ment of all social formations.
Hence; social for-mations are not only divided from one another by their own specific laws, but .
also connected with one another by the economic laws common to all formations.
Engels was quite right when he said: "In order to carry out this critique of bour-geois economy completely, an acquaintance with the capitalist form of production, exchange and distribution did not suffice.
The forms which had preceded it or those which still exist along-side it in less developed countries had also, at least in their main features, to be examined and comparPd.
" ("Anti-Dohring.
") It is obvious that here, on this qur'stion, Comrade Ynreoshenko is in tune with Bukh;irin.
Further, Comrc'lde Yaroshenko dccl:1rcs that in his "Political Economy of Socialism," "the cat-egories of political econ·omy -value, cnmmoclity, money, credit, etc.
, -are replaced by :1 lw:tlthy discussion of the ration<11 nrg<rni1;1tion of the 11 productive forces in ~:ocial product ion, t !wt, con-sequently, the subject of investigation of this po-litical economy will not be the production re-lations of socialism, bul "th<' f'lnborntion and de-velopment of a scientific theory of the organ-.
ization of the productive forces, theory of ec-onomic planning, etc.
," and that, under social-ism, the relations of production lose their in-dependent significance and are absorbed by the productive forces as a component part of them.
It must be said that never before has any re.
trograde "Marxist 11 delivered himself of such unholy twaddle.
Just imagine· a political econ· omy of socialism without economic, production problems! Does such a political <'conomy Pxist <mvwhere in creation? What is the efkct, in a political eco~omy of socialism, of repl<tcing ec-onomic problems by problems of nrgnnization of 1IH' product ivf' forces" Th(~ cf f cct is In ;1holish the political economy of socialism.
And that is 1ust what Comrade Yaroshenko dof": -lw ;ibolish-;~s the political economy of soci:ilism.
In this, his position fully coincides with witl1 that of Bukharin.
Bukharin said that with the f' 1 imin-ation of capitalism, political economy w<w i, · <ilsnbe eliminated.
Comrade Yaroslienko does not say this, but he does it; he does abolish the politic-al economy of socialism.
True, he pretends that he is not in full agreement with Bukharin; but that is only a trick, and a penny-ha'penny trick.
In actual fact h~ is doing what Bukharin preach-ed and what Lenin rose up in arms against.
Comrade Yaroshenko is following in the foot-steps of Bukharin.
Further, Comrade Yaroshenko reduces the problems of the political economy of socialism to problems of the rational organization of the productive forces, to problems of economic plan-ning, etc.
But he -is profoundly in error.
The rational organization of the productive forces, economic planning, etc.
, are not problems of po-litical economy, but problems of the economic policy of the· directing bodies.
They are two dif-ferent provinces, which must not be confused.
Comrade Yaroshenko has confused these two dif-ferent things, and has made -a terrible mess of it.
Political economy investigates the laws of development of man's relations of production.
Economic policy draws practical conclt.
tsions from this, gives them concrete shape, and builds its day to day work on them.
To foist upon po-litical economy problems of economic policy is to kill it as a science.
The province of political economy is the production, the economic rcl;1t ions of nwn.
It includes: a) the forms of owm•rsllip of 1 lw means of production; b) the status of the v;1--rious social groups in product ion and their inter-rrlations that follow from these forms, or what Marx cnlls: "mut_u;il exchange of their activit-ies"; c) the forms of distribution of products, which are entirely determined by them.
All these together constitute· the province of politic-al economy.
This definition does not contain the word "exchange," which figures in Engels' definition.
It is omitted because "exchange" is usually un~ dNstoocl bv many to mean the exchange of com-modities, ;,.
_,hich is characteristic not of all, but only of some social formtltions, and this sorn(~­ times gives rise to _ misunderstanding, even -though the word "exchange" with Engels did not mean only commodity exchange.
As will be seen, however, that which Engels meant by the word "exchange" has been included, as a com-ponent part, in the above definition.
Hence, this definition of the province of political economy fully coincides in content with Engels' de-finition.
2.
When speaking of the basic economic law of some particular social formation, the pre-sumption usually is that the latter cannot have several basic economic laws, that it can have only some one basic economic law, which pre-cisely for that reason is the basic law.
Other-wise we should have several basic economic laws for each social formation, which would be contrary to the very concept of a basic law.
nut Comrade Yaroshenko does not agree with this.
He thinks that it is possible to have not one, but several basic economic laws of social-377ism.
It is incredible, but a fact.
At the Plenary Discussion, he said: "The magnitudes and correlations of .
the material funds of soci0l production and repro-duction 0re d('termined hv the av;1ilahle labour power engaged in soc in I prnduc t ion and its pro-spective incre<tsf'.
This is the basic economic law of socialist society, ;rnd it determines the structure of socialist social production and repro-c!uct ion.
" Th<1t is one basic economic 1'<1w of social-ism.
In this same speech, Comrade Yaroshenko declared: "In socialist society, the correlations be tween Departments I and II are determined by the fact that production must h.
ave means of production in quantities sufficient to enlist all the able-bodied members of the population in so-cial production.
This is the basic economic law of socialism, and it is at the same time a de-mand of our Constitution, following from the right to work enjoyed by Soviet citizens.
" That, so to speak, is a second basic econ-omic law of socialism.
Lastly, in his letter to the members of the Political Bureau, Comrade Yaroshenko declares: "Accordingly, the essential features and re-quirements of the basic economic law of social-ism may, it seems to me, be roughly formulated as follows: the continuous expansion and perfect-ion of the production of the material and cultur-al conditions of the life of society.
" Here we have a third basic economic law of socialism.
Whether all these laws are basic economi_c 18 ws ·of socialism, or on.
Iy one of them, and if only one of them, which exactly -to these questions Comrade Yaroshenko gives no answer in his last letter addressed to the members of the Political Bureau.
When formulating the ba-sic economic law of socialism in his letter to the members.
of the Poli ti cal Bureau, he "for-got," it is to lw presumed, that in his spe:ch at the Plenarv Discussion three months .
earlier he \i;1cl ;1lread~ forrnul;Jtcd two other basic econom-i" J;Jws of socialism, evidently be!feving that no-liodv would not ice this dubious maneouvre, .
to .
';;1y · t lH' ]1'ast of it.
· But, as we see, he m1s-calculated.
Let ·us assume that the first two basic ec-onomic laws of socialism formulated by Com-rade Yaroshenko no longer exist, and that from now on he regards as the basi'c economic law .
?f socialism the third one, which he formulated m his Jetter to the members of the Political Bu-reau.
Let us turn to this letter.
.
Comrade Yaroshenko says in this letter Lhat he· does not agree with the definition of the basic economic law of socialism which Com-rade Stalin gave in his "Rem~rks.
" '.
l~ .
says: 11 .
"The chief thing in• this defm1t1on 1s the securing of the maximum satisfaction of.
.
.
the :e-11 quirements of the whole of society.
Product10n is presented here as the means of attai_ning this principal aim satisfaction of requirements.
Such a definition furnishes grounds for assuming that the basic economic law of socialism formu-lated by you is based not on the primacy of pro-duction, but on the primacy of consumption.
" It is evident that Comrade Yaroshenko has completely failed' to understand the essence of the problem, and does not see that talk about the primacy of consumption or of production has absolutely nothing to do with the case.
When speaking of the primacy of any social process over another, it is usually assumed that the two processes are more or less homogenous in char-acter.
One may, and should, speak of the prima-cy of the production of nieans of production over the production of means of· consumption, because production is involved in both cases, and they are therefore more or .
less homogen-ous.
But one cannot speak, and it would be wrong to speak, of the primacy of consumption ·over production, or of production over consumpt-ion, because production and consumption are two entirely different spheres, which, it is true, are connected with one another, but which are, dif-ferent spheres all the same.
Comrade Yaroshen-ko obviously fails to realise that what we are speaking of here is not the primacy of consumpt-ion or of production, but of what aim society sets social production, to what purpose it subor-dinates social production -under socialism, say.
So that when Comrade Yaroshenko says that "the basis of the life of socialist society, as of all other society, is production," it is entirely beside the point.
Comrade Yaroshenko forgets that men produce not for production's sake, but in order to satis.
fy their needs.
He forgets that production divorced from the satisfaction of-the needs of society withers and dies.
Can we speak in ·general of the aims of capitalist or socilll ist production, of the purposes to which capitalist or socialist production are subordinated? I think that we can and should.
Marx says: "The direct aim of capitalist production is not the production of goods, but the production of surplus value or of profit in its developed form· not the product, but the surplus product.
.
From' this standpoint, labour itself is productive only in so far as it creates profit or surplus pro-clu~t for capital.
In .
so far as the worker does not create it, his labour is unproductive.
Con-sequently, the sum total of applied productive L1bour is of interest to capital only to the ex-1 (~nt that through it -or in relation to it -the .
c;um total of surplus labour .
increases.
Only to 1 lrnt extent is what is called necessary labour 1 inw necessary.
To the extent that it does not 1rn(luce this result, it is superfluous and has to 1 i• discontimwd.
"It is the constant aim of capitalist pro-duct ion to produce the maximum surplus value or surplus product with the minimum of capital advanced; in so far as this result is not attained by overworking the labourer, it is a tendency .
of capital to seek to produce a given product with the least expenditure -economizing labour po-wer and costs .
.
.
1'"The labourers themselves figure in this conception as what they actually are.
in capital-ist production -only means of production; not an aim in themselves and not the aim of pro-duction.
" ("Theory of Surplus Value," Vol.
II, Part 2.
) .
These words of Marx are remarkable not only because they-concisely and precisely define the aim of capitalist production, but also be-cause they indicate the basic aim, the principal purpose, which socialist production should be set.
Hence, the aim of capitalist production is profit-making.
As to consumption, capitalism needs it only in so far as it ensures the making of profit.
Outside of this, consumption means nothing to capitalism.
Man and his needs disap-pear from its field of vision.
· What is the aim of socialist production? What is that main purpose to which social pro-duction should be subordinated under socialism? The aim of socialist production is not pro-fit, but man and his needs, that is, the sCltis-faction of his material and cultural require-ments.
As is stated in Comrade Stalin's "Re-marks," the aim of socialist production is "the securing of the maximum satisfaction of the con-stantly nstng material and cultural reql1ire-ments of the whole of society.
" Comrade Yaroshenko thinks that what he is confronted with here is the "primacy" of con-sumption over production.
That, of course, is a misapprehension.
Actually, what we have here is not the primacy of consumption, but the sub-1ircJination of sociali!lt production to its principal ~1im of securing the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising m·?terial and cultural.
re-quirements of the whole of societ_y.
.
Consequently, maximum satisfaction of _the constantly rising material and cultural_ require-ments of the whole of society is the aim of so-cialist production; continuous expansion and per-fection of of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques is the means for the achievement of the aim.
.
Such is the basic economic law of social-.
ism.
• 11 Desiring to preserve what he calls the pri-macy'' of production ·over c~~su~ption, C~mrade Yaroshenko claims that the basic economic law of socialism" consists in "the continuous ex-fl<;nsion and perfection of the production o'.
th~ material and cultural conditions of society.
That is absolutely wrong.
Comrade Yarosh~nko gros~ly distor:s ~~d ~itiates t 1?e ~ormula give~ i 11 Comrade Stalin s Remarks.
With him, pro <!11ct ion is converted from a means into an end,.
:11id the maximum satisfaction of the constantly 1 ising mnteri<1l and cultural require~ents of ~o­ ('ict v is thrown out.
What we get 1s expansion of rroduction for the sake of expansion of pro-<luclion, production as an aim in itself; man and his requirements disappear from Comrade Yaro-shenko's field of vision.
It is therefore not surpnsmg that, with the disappearance of man as the aim of social-383ist production, every vestige of Marxism disap-pears from Comrade Yaroshenko's "c'onception.
" And so, what Comrade Yaroshenko arrives at is not the "primacy" of production over con-sumption, but something like the "primacy" of bourgeois ideology over Marxist ideology.
3.
A question_ by itself is Marx's theory of reproduction.
Comrade Yaroshenko asserts that the Marxian theory of reproduction is a theory of capitalist reproduction only, that it contains nothing that might have validity for other social formations, the socialist social formation in par-ticular.
He says: "The extension of Marx's scheme of repro-duction, which he elaborated for the capitalist economy, to socialist social production is the fruit of a dogmatic understanding of Marx 1s theory and runs counter to.
the essence of his theory.
" (Comrade Yaroshenko's speech at the Plenary Discussion.
) He further asserts: "Marx's scheme of re-production does not correspond to the economic laws of socialist society and cannot serve as a basis in the investigation of socialist repro-duction.
" (Ibid.
) Concerning Marx's theory of simple repro-duction, which establishes a definite correlation between the production of means of production (Department I) and the production of means of consumption (Department II), Comrade Yaro-shenko says: "In socialist society, the correlation be-tween Departments I and II is not determined by Marx's formula v+m of Department and '-of Department II·.
There should be no such inter-connection in development between Departments I and II under socialist cpnditions.
" (Ibid.
) He asserts: "The theory of the correlation between Departments I and II worked out by Marx is not applicable in our socialist con-ditions, since Marx's theory is based on capi~al­ ist economy and its laws.
" (Comrade Yaro-shenko's letter to the members of the Politic~! Bureau.
) · · That is how Comrade Yaroshenko makes mincemeat of Marx's theory of reproduction.
Of course Marx's theory of reproduction, which was the' fruit of an investigation· of the laws .
of · the capitalist mode of production, · re-flects the specific character of the latter, and, naturally,' is clothed in the form of capitalist-commodity value relations.
It could not have been otherwise.
But he who sees in Marx's theo-ry of reproduction only its form, and does not observe its fundamentals, its essential substance which holds good not only for the capitnlist so-cial formation alone, has no understanding what-ever of this theory.
If Comrade Yaroshenko hcirl any understanding at all of the matter, he would have realized .
'the self-evident truth that Marx's scheme of reproduction does not begin nnd end with a reflection of the specific chrir" acter of the capitalist mode of produ· that it at the same time contains a whole num · ber of fundamental tenets on the subject of re-production which hold good for all social form-~tions, .
particularly and especially for the social-ist soc1al.
formation.
Such fundamental tenets of the Marx1a~ theory of reproduction as the divis-ion of social production into the production of means of production and the production of means of consumption; the relatively greater in-crease of producqon of means of production in repr~duction on an extended scale; the cor-relation between Departments I and II; surplus produc~ as the sole source of accumulation; the format10n and designation of the social funds· accumulation as the sole source of reproductio~ on an extended scale -all these fundamental tenets of the Marxian theory.
of reproduction are at the same time tenets which hold good not onl~ .
for the capitalist formation,.
and which no s?c1altst .
society can dispense with in the planning of its national economy.
It is signific-ant that Comrade Yaroshenko himself who snor~s s~ .
haugh~ily at Marx's "schemes of' repro-?uct1on, ts obltged every now and again to call m the help of these "schemes" when discussing problems of socialist reproduction.
And matter? how did Lenin and Marx view the Everyone is familiar with Lenin's critical comments on Bukharin's "Economics of the Tr-ansi.
tion Period.
" In these remarks, as we know, Lenin recognized that Marx's formula of the cor-rel~tions between Departments I and II, against which Comrade Yaroshenko rises in arms, holds true both for socialism and for "pure commun-ism," that is, for the second phase of commun-ism.
As to Marx, he, as we know, did not like to digress from his investigation of the laws of capitalist production, and did not in his "Capit-al," discuss the applicability of his schemes of reproduction to socialism.
However, in Chapter XX, Vol.
II of "Capital," in the section, "The Constant Capital of Department I," where he ex·-amines the exchange of Department I product; within this department, Marx, as though in pass-ing, observes that under socialism the exchange of~ products within this department would pro-.
ceed with the same regularity as under the cap-italist mode of production.
He says: "If production were socialized, instead of capit81istic, it is evident that these products of Department i" would just as regularly be redis-tributed <1~; means of production to the various lines of production of this department, for pur-poses of reproduction, one portion.
remaining di-r(•ct Iv in that sphere of production which cre-;1tccl it, another passing over to other lines of production of the same department, thereby .
en-tertaining a const<rnt mutual exchange between the various lines of production of this depart-7 ment.
" (Marx, "Capital," Vol.
II, 8th Ed.
, p.
30 \ Consequently, Marx by no means consim.

ed that his theory o,f reproduction was valid on-ly for the capitalist mode of production, al-though it was the laws of the capitalist mode of production he was investigating.
We see, on the contrary, that he held that his theory of re-production might be valid als~ for.
the socialist mode of production.
It sho~ld be remar:ked that, when analyzin the of socialism and of the al period to c~!11munism in his "Critique of the Gotha Program, .

rom the fu?damental tenets oJ Marx's theory of reproduction, regarding them .
as obligatory for the communist system.
Such are the facts.
.
It appears, then, that here too, in the ques~1on ~f repro~uction, Comrade Yaroshenko, ~espite ~Is sneering attitude towards Marx's schemes, has again landed on the shoals.
4.
Comrade Yaroshenko concludes his let-ter to the members of the Political Bureau with the proposal that the compilation of the "Poiitic-al Ec~nomy of Socialism" be entrusted to him He writes: · .
"On the ba_si.

would convert this science into ar effective weapon of the struggle of the people for Communism.
" It must be confessed that modesty is not one of Comrade Yaroshenko's failings -"even the other way round," it might be said, borrow-ing the style of some of our writers • It has already been pointed out above that Comrade Yaroshenko confuses the political econ-·omy of socialism with the economic policy of the directing bodies.
That which he considers the province of the p-olitical economy of social-ism -rational organiza.
tion of the productive forces, economic planning, formation of social funds, etc.
, -is the province of the economic policy of the directing bodies, and not of the political economy of socialism.
· I say nothing of the fact that the serious blunders committed by Comrade Yaroshenko, and his un-Marxist "opinions" do not incline one to entrust him· with such a task.

REPLY TO COMRADES A.
V.
SANINA AND V.
G.
VENZHER have received your· letters.
It can ·be seen from them that their authors ar·e making a profound and serious study of the economic problems of our country.
There are quite a num-ber of correct formulations and interesting argu-ments in the letters.
But alongside of these, there are some grave theoretical errors .
.
It is on these errors that I propose to dwell in this reply.
· 1.
CHARACTER OF THE ECONOMIC LAWS OF SOCIALISM Comrades Sanina and Venzher claim that "only because of the conscious action of the So-viet citizens engaged in material production do the economic laws of socialism arise.
" This op-inion is absolutely incorrect.
Do the laws of economic development ex-ist objectively, outside of us, independently of the will and consciousness of man? Marxism answers this question in the affirmative.
Marx-ism holds that the laws of the political economy of socialism are a reflection in the minds of men of objective laws existing outside of us.
But Comrades Sanina's.
and Venzher's formula answers this question in the negative.
That means that these comrades are adopting the PO'" sition of an incorrect theory which asserts that under socialism the laws of economic develop-ment are "created," "transformed" by the direct-.
ing bodies of society.
In other words, they are ·breaking with Marxism and taking the stand of subjective idealism.
Of course, men ·can discover these object-ive laws, come to know them· and, relying upon tt1em, utifize them in the interests of societv.
13ut they cannot "create" them, nor can t 1 "transform" them.
Suppose for a moment 'that we accepted this incorrect theory which denies the ex is tense of objective ·laws of economic activity under so-cialism, and which proclaims the possibility.
of "creating" ·and "transforming" economic laws.
Where would it lead us? It would lead us into the realm of chaos and chance, we should find ourselves in slavish dependence on chances, and we should be forfeiting the possibility not only of understanding, but of simply finding our way about in this chaos of chances.
The effect would be that we should be stroying political economy as a science, becau:;escience cannot exist and develop unless it rec-ognizes the existence of objective laws, · and studies them.
And by .
destroying science, we should be forfeiting the possibility of foreseeing the course of developments in the economic life of the country, in other words, we should be for-feiting the possibility of providing even the most elementary economic leadership.
In the end we should find ourselves at the mercy of "economic" adventurers who are ·ready to "destroy" the laws of economic development and to "create" new laws without any under-standing of, or consideration for objective law.
Everyone is familiar with .
the classic for-mulation of the Marxist position on this· question given by Engels in his "Anti-Dohring": "The forces operating in socjety work ex-actly like the.
forces operating in nature: blind-ly, violently, destructively, so long as we do not understand them and fail to take them into ac-count.
But when once we have come to know them and understand how they work, their di-rection and their effects, the gradual subje~tion of them to our will and the use · of them for the attainment of our aims depend entirely upon ourselves.
And this is especially true of the mighty productive forces of the present day.
So long as we obstinately refuse to understand their nature and their character -and the cap-italist mode of production and its defenders set themselves against any such attempt -these for-ces operate in spite of us, against us, dominate us, as we have shown in detail.
But once their nature is grasped, in the hands of the producers working in association they can be trnnsformed from demoniacal masters into willing scrv<ints.
This is the difference l;>etween the destructive forces of electricity in the lightning of u thun-derstorm and the tamed electricity of the tele-graph and the arc light; the differe~ce between a conflagration and fire in the ser_v1ce of ma~.
Such treatment of today's productive forces m accordance with their nature, now becomes known at last, opens the way to the replace-mPnt of the anarchy of social production by a socially planned regulation of production in ac-.
co'rdance with the needs both of society as a whole and of each individual.
The capitalist mode of appropriation, in which the product en-slaves first the producer, and then also the ap-propriator, will thereby be replaced by the mode ( 1f ;1ppropri:1' i 1n of the product based o.

" 2.
MEASURES FOR EVALUATING COLLECTIVE FARM PROPERTY TO THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC PROPERTY What measures are necessary to rni<>r col-lective farm property, which, of coLtr:'(', is not public property, to the level of public ("nation-al") property? Some comrades think that the thing to do is simply to nationalize collective farm prop-erty, to proclaim it public property, in the way that was done.
· in the past in the case of cap-italist property.
· Such a proposal would be abso-lutely wrong and .
quite unacceptable.
Collective farm property is socialist property, and we sim-~ly cannot treat it in the same way as capital-ist property.
From the fact that collective farm property is not public property, it by no means follows that it is not socialist property.
These comrades believe that the conversion of the property of individuals or groups of indi-viduals into state property is the oniy, or at any rate the best, form of nationalization.
That is not true.
The fact is that conversion into state property is not the only, or even the best, form of nationalization, but the initial form of nationalization,_ as Engels quite rightly.
says in "Anti-Dohring.
" Unquestionably, so long as the state exists, conversion into state property is the most natural initial form of· nationalization.
But the state will not exist forever.
With the extension of the sphere of operation of social-ism in the majority of the countries of the world the state will die away, and, of course, · the conversion of the property of individuals or groups of individuals into state property will con-sequently lose its meaning.
The state will have d.
ied away, but society will remain.
Hence, the heir of the public property will then be not the state, which will have died away, but society it-self, in Lhe shape of a central, directing econ-omic body.
That .
.
11g so, what must be done to raise collective farm property to the level of public property? The proposals made by Comrades ~an~na and Venzher as the chief means of ach1evm.
g such an elevation of collective farm property is to sell the basic implements of production con-centrated in the Machine and Tractor Stations to the collective farms as their property, thus releasing the state from the necessity of making capital investments in agriculture, and t? make .
the collective farms themselves responsible for the maintenance and development of the mach-ine and tractor stations.
They say: "It is wrong to believe that collective farm investments must be used chiefly for the cultural n• .
· of the collective farm village, whi I(' t lw "('ater bulk of the investments for.
t lw needs .
,f agricultural production must con-t imic as l·~illerto to be borne ·by the state.
Would it 11()t be more correct to relieve the state of this burden, seeing that the collective farms arc.
capnble of taking it entirely upon themselves? The state will have plenty of under-· takings in which to invest its fund~ with a view to creating an abundance of articles of con-sumption in the country.
" .
.
The authors advance several arguments m support of their proposal.
First.
Referring to Stalin's statement thal means of production are not sold even to the 395collective farms, the authors of .
the proposal cast.
doubt on this statement of Stalin's by de-claring tha~ the state, .
after all, does sell means of.
prod~ct1on to the collective farms, such as mmor 1mplem_ents, like scythes and sickles small power engines, etc.
They consider that the state ~an sell such means of production to the collective farms, it might ·also sell them other means of production, such as the machines of the MTS.
This argument is untenable.
The state, of cou~se, does sell minor implements to the col-le~t1ve f~rms, as,.
indeed, it has to in com-pllance with the Rules of the Agricultural Artel · and the Constitution.
But can we lurrip in one category minor implements and such basic agri-cultural means of production as tne machines of t~e MTS's, or, let us say, the land, which, after all, Is also one of the basic means of production in agriculture? Obviously not.
They cannot be lumped in one category because · minor im-plements do not in any degree decide the fate of collective farm production, .
whereas.
such mea~s of production as the machines of the MTS s and the land entirely decide the fate of agriculture in our present-day conditions.
It should not be difficult to understand that when Stalin said that means of production are not sold to the collective farms, it was not minor implements he had in mind, but the basic means of agricultural production: the machines of.
the MTS's, th~ land.
The authors are playing with the words means of production" and are if confusing two different things, without observing that they are getting into a mess.
Second.
Comrades Sanina and Venzher fur-ther refer to the fact that in the early period of the mass collective farm movement -end of 1929 and beginning of 1930 -the C.
C.
, C.
P.
S.
-U.
(B.
) was itself in favour of transferring the machine and tractor stations to the collective farms as their property, requiring them to pay off the cost of the MTS's over a period of '; , ee years.
They consider that although nothing came of this at the time, "in view of the pov-erty" of the collective farms, now th<lt ·they · lrnve become wealthy it might be expedient to rcLurn to this policy, namely, the sale of the \1TS's to the collective farms.
This argument is likewise untenable.
A de-cision really was adopted by the C.
C.
, C.
P.
S.
-U.
(B.
) in the early part of 1930 to sell the MTS's to the collective farms.
It was adopted at the suggestion of a group· of collective farm shock workers as an experiment, as a trial, with the idea of reverting to the question at an ear-ly date and re-examining it.
But the first trial demonstrated the inadvisability of this decision, and a few months later, namely, at the close of 1930, it was rescinded.
The susequent spread of the co .
· Live farm movement and the development of col-lective; farm construction definitely convinced hoth the collective farmers and the leading of-1 icials th:il concentration of the basic im-p:r'111('11t s f)r ;igriculturnl production in the hands.
397of the state,· in the hands of the machine and tractor stations, was the only way of ensuring a high rate of expansion of collective farm pro-duction.
We are .
all gratified by the tremendous strides agricultural production in our country is making, by the .
increasing output of grain, cot-ton, flax, sugar beet, etc.
What is the source of this increase? It .
.
is the increase of up-to-date technical equipment, the numerous up-to-date machines which are serving all branches of pro-duction.
It is not a question of machinery gener-ally; the question ·is that machinery cannot re-main at a standstill, it must ·be perfected ·all the time, old ·machinery being scrapped and re-placed by new, and the new by newer still.
With-out this, the onward march of our.
socialist agri-culture would be impossible; big harvests and an abundance of agricultural produce would be out of the question.
But what is involved in scrap-ping hundreds of thousands of wheel tractors and replacing them by caterpillar tractors, in re-placing tens of thousands of obsolete harvester-combines by more up-to-date ones, in creating new machines, say, for industrial crops? It in-volves an expenditure of billions of rubles which can be recouped only after the lapse of six or eight years.
Are our collective farms capable of bearing such an expense, even though their in-comes may run into the millions? No, they are not, since they are not in the position to under-take the expenditure of billions of rubles which may be recouped· only after a period of six to eight years.
Such expenditures can be borne only by the state, for it, and it alone, is in the position to bear the loss involved by the scrap-ping · of old machines ?nd replacing 'them by new; because it, and it alone, is in a position to bear such losses for six or eight years and only then recover the outlays.
· .
.
hat, in view of .
this, would be the effect of selling the MTS's to the collective farms as their property? The effect would be to · invol~e the rollective farms in heavy loss and to rum them, to undermine the mechanization of agri-culture, and to slow up the development of col-.
lective farm production.
The conclusion therefore is that, in pro-posing that the the MTS's should be sold to the collective farms as their property, Comrades Sanina and Venzher are suggesting a step in re-version to the old backwardness and are trying to turn back the wheel of history.
Assuming for a moment· that we accepted Comrades Sanina's and Venzher's proposal and began to s~ll the basic implements.
of producl-ion, the machine and tractor stations, to tne collective farms as their property.
What would be the outcome? The outcome would be, first, that the col-lective farms would become the owners of the basic instruments of production; that is, the~r status would be an exceptional one, such as 1s not shared by any other enterprise i.
n ou.
r count-ry, for, as we know, even the nat1onal1zed en-terprises do not own their instruments of pro-.
duction.
How, by what considerations of progress and advancement, could this exceptional status of the collective farms .
be justified? Can it be said that such a status would facilitate the el-evation of collective farm property to the level of public property, that it would expedite the transition of our society from socialism to com-munism? Would it not be truer to say that such a status could only dig a deeper gulf between collective farm property and public property, arid would not bring us any nearer to commun-ism, but, on the contrary, remove us farther from it? The outcome would be, secondly, an ex-tension of the sphere of operation of commodity circulation, because a gigantic quantity of instru-ments of agricultural production.
would come within its orbit.
What do Comrades Sanina and Venzher think -is the extension of the sphere of commodity circulation calculated to promote our advance towards communism? Would it not be truer to say that our advance towards com-munism would only be retarded by it? , Comrades Sanina's and Venzher's basic er-ror lies in the fact that they do not understand the role and significance of commodity circ-ulation under socialism; that they do not under-stand that commodity circulation is incompatible with the prospective transition from socialism to communism.
They evidently think that the transition from socialism to communism is pos-sible even with commodity circulation, that com-modity .
circulation can be no obstacie to this.
That is a profound error, arising from an in-adequate grasp of Marxism.
Criticizing Dohring's "economic commun~," which functions in the c;:onditions of commodity circulation, Engels, in his "Anti-Dohring," c~n­ vincingly shows that the existence of commo?Ity circulation was inevitably bound to lead Duhr-1ng's so-called "economic communes" to .
the re-generation of capitalism.
Comrades_ Sam~a and Venzher evidently do not agree with this.
All the worse for them.
But we, Marxists, adhere to the Marxist view that the transition from socialism to communism and the communist prin-.
ciple of distribution of products according to preclude all commodity exchange, ~nd, 1weds hence, rreclucle the conversion of prod_u~ts into commodities, and, with it, their conversion into value.
So much for the proposal and arguments of Comrades Sanina and Venzher.
But what, then, should be done to elevate collective 1arm property to the level of public property? .
The collective farm is an unusual kind of enterprise.
· It operates on land, and cultivate: l<rnd which has long been public, and not col-lective farm property.
Consequently, the col-if-~ctive farm is not the owner of the land 1t cul-tivates.
· h Further, the collective farm operates w1.
t basic implements of production which are puhl 1c, not collective farm property.
Consequent I>, 'he collective I .
irm is not the owner of its basic im-plements of production.
further, the collective farm is a co-operative enterprise: it utilizes the labour of its members, and it distributes its income among its members on· the basis of workday units;· it owns its seed, which is renewed every year and goes into production.
What, then, does the collective farm own? Where is the collective farm property which it disposes of quite freely, at its own discretion? This property of the collective farm is its pro-duct, the product of collective farming: grain, meat, butter, vegetables, cotton, sugar beet, flax, etc.
, not counting the buildings _and the personal husbandry of the collective farmers on their household plots.
The fact is that · a con-siderable part of this product, the surplus col-lective farm .
output, goes into the market and is thus included in the system of commodity circulation.
It is precisely · this circumstance which now prevents the elevation of collective farm property to the level of public property.
It is therefore precisely from this end that.
the work of elevating collective farm property to the level of public property must be tackled.
In order to raise collective .
farm property to the level of public property, the surplus col-lective farm output must be excluded from the system of commodity circulation and included in the system of products-exchange between state industry and the collective farms.
That is the point.
:ucts-exchange, but the rudiments of such a sys-tem exist in the-shape of the "merchandising" ()f ngriculturnl products.
for quite a long time :ilrendy, as we know, the.
products of the cotton-growin~.
flax-growing, beet-growing and other collect,.
c farms are "merchandised.
" They are not "merchandised" in full, it is true, but only pc_1rtly, still they are "merchandised.
" Be it mentioned in pnssing that "merchandising" is not · happy word, and should be replaced by "pre: ducts-exchange.
" The task is to extend these rudime: of products-exchange to all branches of agrh ,j[ture and to develop them into a broad system, under which the collective farms would receive for their products not only money, but ~dso and chiefly the· manufactures they need.
Such a system would r(· ,uire an immense fn-crease in · the goods allocated by the town to the country, and it would therefore have to be introduced without any particular hurry, and on-ly as the products of the town multiply.
But it must be introduced un:-:'• ervingly and unhes.
itat-ingly, step by step contracting the sphere of operation of commodity circulation and widen_ing the sphere of operation of products-exchange.
Such a system, by contracting the sphere of operation of commodity circ~la~ion, will fa-cilitate the transition from soc1ahsm to com-munism.
Moreover, it will make it possible to inclurle the basic property of the collectivP farms, the product of collective farmini;, in th'.
· general system of national planning.
That will be a real and effective means ofraising collective farm property to .
the level of public property under our present-day ·con-ditions.
~ill such a system be advantageous to the colle~tlve farm.
· peasantry? It undoubtedly will.
It will, because· the collective farm peasantry will receive .
far more products from the state than under commodity circulation; and at much cheaper prices.
Everyone knows that the col-lective farms which have products-exchange ("merchandising") contracts with the government receive incomparably greater advantages than the collective farms which have no such con-tracts.
If the products-exchange system is ex-tended to all the collective farms in the count-ry, these advantages will become available to all our collective farm peasantry.

, 19 52 Comrades! Permit me, in the name of our Party Con-gress, to express our thanks to all fraternal part-ies and organizations whose representatives have honoured our Party Congress by their presence, or who have sent our Party Congress greetings of friendship, for ·their wishes for our further success and for their confidence.
(Stormy, pro-longed applause that became an ovation.
) for us, this trust is especially valuable as it signifies their readiness to support our Party In Its struggle for n hPtter future for the peo-ple, in its struggle against war, in its struggle to keep peace.
(Stormy, prolonged applause.
) It would be a mistake to believe that our Party, ·which has become a mighty power, does not need more support.
That would be \\;'rong.
Our Party and our country need the continuous trust, sympathy and support of fraternal peoples outside our borders, and will always need it.
The special quality of this support lies in that every support of the peace endeavours of our Party by each fraternal party, simultaneous-ly signifies the support of their own people in their struggle to keep peace.
As the English workers in the years 1918-1919, during the arm-ed attack of the English bourgeoisie on the Sov-iet Union, organized their struggle against the war under the slogan "Hands off Russia!", was a support, it was above all a support of the st~uggle of their own .
people for peace, and then, also, a support of the Soviet Union.
If Comrade Thorez or Comrade Togliatti declare that their people do not want to be led into a war against .
the people of the Soviet Union, (stormy applause), then that is a support, :1l>ove all a support for the French and Italian w1 q·i;crs <rncl peGsants who struggle for peace, :111d Lhen, also, a support of the ·peace endeav-ours of the Soviet Union.
The special quality of · the present support is thus explained, that the interests of our Party are not only not against the interests of the ·peace-loving people; but on the contrary, blend with them.
(Stormy ap-plause.
) Where the Soviet Union is concerned, its interest in the matter of world peace cannot be seperated from the cause of peace in the whole world.
· It is understood that our Party must do its duty by its fraternal parties and support them and their peoples in the struggle for liberation and in their struggle for keeping peace.
This is what the Party does.
(Stormy applause.
) After the seizure of power by•our Party in 1917, and after our Party took real measures to eliminate the yoke of capitalists and landlords, the rep-resentatives of the fraternal parties, inspired by our daring and the success of our Party, gave it the name "Shock Brigade" of the revolution-ary movement and the workers' movement ofthe world.
Thereby they expressed the hope that the success of the "Shock Brigade" would al-leviate the sufferings of the people in the situ-ation of being under the capitalist yoke.
I think that our Party .
has fulfilled these hopes, especial-ly in the time of the second world war, as the Soviet Union smas_hed the German and Japanese fascist tyranny and liberated the· European and Asian peoples from the danger of fascist sla-very.
(Stormy applause.
) Of course it was very difficult to fulfil this honourable task as long as there was only one "Shock Brigade," as long as it stood alone, the avant-garde in the fulfilment of this task.
But that is in the past.
Now it is completely different.
Now, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, new "Shock Brig-ades" have appeared on the ·map, in the form of people's democracies; now the struggle has been eased for our Party and also the work proceeds better.
(Stormy, prolonged applause.
) .
Special attention must be paid to the com-munist, democratic or worker and peasant .
part-ies that are not yet in power and which must carry out their work under the yoke of strict, bourgeois rule.
Of course their work is more difficult.
But their work is not so difficult as it was for us Russian Communists· in the time of the Tsar, as the smallest step forward was declared a serious crime.
The Russian Commun-ists nevertheless held firm, did not retreat from difficulties and came to victory.
The same will be the case with these parties.
Why is it that these parties do not have such difficult work as the Russian Communists had in the times of Tsarism? Because first of all, they have the exam-ple of the s;ruggle and success, as i? the So~iet Union and in the people's democratic countries, before them.
Consequently, they can learn from the mistakes and successes of these countries and thus ease their work.
Because, secondly, the bourgeoisie itself, the arch-enemy of the freedom movement, has be~ome different, has essentially changed, has become more reactionary, has lost the coop-.
eration of the people and thus has been weaken-ed.
It is understood that these circumsta~ces must likewise ease tlie work of the revolution-.
:1rv :ind democratic parties.
(Stormy applause.
) .
· Earlier, the bourgeoisie presented them-S<'ivcs as JibPral, they were for bourgeois demo-cr:1tic freedom and in that way gained popular-ity with the people.
Now there is not one re-m.
aining trace of liberalism.
There is no such thing as "freedom of personality" any more, -personal rights are now only acknowledged.
by them, the· owners of capital, -~ll the other citizens· are regarded as raw materials, that are only for exploitation.
The principle of .
equal rights for people and nations is trodden m the dust and it is replaced by the principle of full rights for the exploiting mino_rit~ and the lack of rights of the exploited ma1ority of t_he ci ! • zens The banner of bourgeois democratic fn' do~.
has been flung overboard.
I think that you,the representatives of communist and democrat-ic parties must pick up this banner and carry it forward if you want to ·gain the majority of the people.
There is nobody else to raise it.
(Stormy applause.
) Earlier, the bourgeoisie, as the heads of na-tions, were for the rights and independence of nations and put that "above all.
" Now there is no trace left of this "national principle.
" Now the bourgeoisie sell the rights and independence of their nations for dollars.
The banner of na-tional independence and national sovereignty has been thrown overboard •.
Without doubt, you, the representatives of the communist and democrat-ic parties must raise this banner and· carry it forward if you want to be patriots of your countries, if you want to be the .
leading powers of the nations.
There is nobody else to raise it.
(Stormy applause.
) That is how matters stand at present.
It is understood that all these circum-stances must ease the work of the communist and democratic parties that are not y~t in power.
Consequently, there is every ground for the success and victory of the fraternal parties in the lands of capitalist rule.
(Stormy ap-plause.
) Long live our fraternal parties! (Prolonged applause.
) Long life and health to the leaders of the fraternal parties! (Prolonged applause.
) Long live the peace between the peoples! (Prolonged applause.
) Down with .
the arsonists of war! (Everyone stood up.
Stormy, prolonged applause that be-cc.
ime an ovation •.
There.
were shouts of "Long live Comrade Stalin!" "Long live the great lead-er of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin!" "The great Stalin!" "Long live peace be-tween the peoples!") (Speech at the 19th Party Congress of the C.
