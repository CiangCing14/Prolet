0/Note from Foreign Languages Press It’s with great joy that we release this new printing of Volume VII of the “Unofficial” Selected Works of Mao Zedong.
This volume was initially released by our Indian comrades from Kranti Publications in 1991, but was out of stock by the end of the 90s and has since been unavailable in hard copy or online.
This volume covers the period from the founding of the People’s Republic (October 1949) until the Great Leap Forward (1958) and contains 478 doc-uments that are not included in the “Official” Volume V of the Selected Works that covered this period.
While the “Official” Volume V gave us access to documents reflecting Chairman Mao’s philosophy, as well as his ideas regarding the development of the economy, this volume is mainly composed of his letters and telegrams showing all the difficulties that the chairman of the newly founded People’s Republic of China had to face, including the danger of imperialist aggres-sions as seen during the Korean War (1950-1953), the delicate situation of national minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet and the complexity of diplomacy.
These correspondences also show the challenge of how to treat all Mao’s former neighbors, childhood friends and cousins and their requests for his attention, positions and recognition.
Unlike Volume VI for which we played mostly the role of “re-printer,” this volume is a new edition, with over a thousand typos corrected and names and words changed from the Wade-Giles to the pinyin spelling.
This was done both for practicality and readability, but also to uphold the Directive on Language Reform that Chairman Mao promulgated in 1951 (p.
148), which was the starting point of work on the simplification of Chinese characters (adopted in 1952) and the pinyin system (adopted in 1958).
This edition also contains new indexes of Chinese names and places, as well as non-Chinese names, which will allow the reader to navigate the 478 docu-ments with greater ease.

Telegram to Xinjiang Political and Military Authorities September 28, 1949 General Tao Zhiyue1 and the officers and soldiers under his command, Chairman Burhan2 and the government workers under him: Your telegrams of September 25 and 26 have been received.
We believe that 1.
Tao Zhiyue (1892-1988), a Hunanese military officer who graduated from the Baoding Military Academy in 1916 and served in various officer positions in the Hunan Army before participating in the KMT army in the Northern Expedition period.
At the begin-ning of the War of Resistance against Japan, he was commander of the 36th Army, and later the commander of the First Army and deputy commander.
At the end of the war of Resistance he became the deputy commander of the KMT’s 8th Battle Zone, and in 1946, assumed command of the KMT’s Xinjiang Garrison.
In 1948, the Hexi district garrison was added to his command, and he also became deputy director of the Northwest Com-munist-Suppression Bureau of the KMT.
His defection and surrender to the Communist forces at this time (Sept.
1949) was a severe blow to the KMT forces.
In 1949-1950, the PRC commissioned him as commander of the 22nd Army Group and deputy commander of the Xinjiang Military District under Peng Dehuai.
In 1950 he also became a member of the Provisional People’s Government of Xinjiang and a member of the Northwest Military and Government Council.
2.
Burhan Shahidi (1896), also known by the sinicized version of his name, Bao Erhan, was made governor of Xinjiang Province by the KMT government in 1948.
On the eve of the Communist victory.
Burhan joined the Communist side and assumed the positions of chairman of the Provisional People’s Government of Xinjiang and president of the Xinjiang People’s Court.
In 1950, he became a member of the Northwest Military and Government Council, and since then he has been a prominent representative of the people of Xinji-ang in various national organizations in the PRC, such as the National Committee of the CPPCC.
your standpoint is a correct one.
You have declared your severance from the remnants of the reactionary government in Guangzhou3 and your new orien-tation towards the camp of People’s Democracy; you have accepted the leader-ship of the People’s Political Consultative Conference4 and await and abide by the orders and disposition of the Central People’s Government and the People’s Revolutionary Military Council.
This attitude conforms to the wishes of the people of the entire nation.
We are most happy.
We hope that you will unite all military and civilian governmental personnel in maintaining the unity of the nationalities and local order and cooperate with the People’s Liberation Army, which is preparing at this moment to move northward, to abolish the old system and implement the new one, so as to strive for the establishment of a new Xinjiang.

Proclamation of the Central People’s Government of the PRC October 1, 1949 The people throughout China have been plunged into bitter suffering and tribulations since the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary government betrayed the fatherland, colluded with imperialists, and launched the count-er-revolutionary war.
Fortunately, our People’s Liberation Army, backed by the whole nation, has been fighting heroically and selflessly to defend the territo-rial sovereignty of our homeland, to protect the people’s lives and property, to relieve the people of their sufferings, and to struggle for their rights, and it eventually wiped out the reactionary troops and overthrew the reactionary rule of the Nationalist government.
Now, the People’s War of Liberation has been basically won, and the majority of the people in the country have been liberated.
On this foundation, the first session of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, composed of delegates of all the democratic parties 3.

Telegram to the Communist Party of the United States October 6, 1949 Dear Comrade Foster and Comrade Dennis, and all comrades of the Na-tional Committee of the Communist Party of the United States of America: We are extremely grateful for your enthusiastic congratulations on the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
Please convey our gratitude to all members of the Communist Party of the United States of America, and to all the people who love peace and justice and bear goodwill toward the Chinese people in the United States.
Indeed, as you yourselves said, the triumph of the Chinese people is a tri-umph over imperialism, first and foremost over United States imperialism.
This victory is a part of the results of the general struggle which the work-ing-class and progressive people in the whole world are waging against the world camp of imperialism.
In this struggle the Communists of the United States and all sincere advocates of democracy are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people.
In the assistance given to the Chinese people in their cause of justice and in the heroic struggle to resist the reactionary policy of opposing China on the part of the US imperialists, the Communists of the United States of America hold a place of exceptional honor.
In spite of the fact that the reactionary gov-ernment of the United States is savagely persecuting the Communist Party of the United States and progressive forces in the United States, and is illegally in-terrogating eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States, name-ly, Comrade Dennis, Comrade Williamson, Comrade Winston, Comrade Stachel, Comrade Davis, Comrade Winter, Comrade Thompson, ComradeGates, Comrade Potash, Comrade Green and Comrade Hall,5 it has ultimately been demonstrated nonetheless that the Communist Party of the United States and the forces of progress in the United States of America are correct, and it is their Chinese friends who have triumphed, whereas the current imperialist government of the United States, which violates the principles of justice, has consequently gone down in shameful defeat.
This fact cannot but give courage to all the forces of democracy in the world who are but temporarily in a posi-tion of being oppressed; it cannot but educate all people who are momentarily under the rule and deceptive sway of the reactionaries.
Long live the friendship of the people of China and the United States of America! (Signed and Dated) Source: People’s Daily, October 8, 1949.

The founding of the German Democratic Republic signifies a fundamental change in the history of Germany.
The masses of the people have replaced the monopoly capitalists and the big landowners as the masters of Germany.
Owing to the founding of the German Democratic Republic, Germany which was the spawning ground of two world wars and the focus of militarism and fascism, has now joined the ranks of the People’s Democracies in the world.
This is a decisive defeat for the criminal policy of the imperialist front led by the reactionary government of the United States of America of splitting Ger-many in the period after the Second World War and of reviving Germany as a reactionary state and a base for war.
This is a great victory for the camp for world peace and democracy led by the Soviet Union.
People’s Germany and People’s China are both standing in the front lines of the great struggle against imperialism.
We are particularly glad on this occa-sion of the proclamation of the founding of Democratic Germany.
We extend our best wishes that under the leadership of the people’s democratic forces the unification of Germany will be restored and Germany will grow in strength with each passing day.
May the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples grow with each passing day.

This is a great honor for the Communist Party of China.
The struggles of the people of China and the peoples of Europe are two insep-arable and mutually reinforcing parts of a common cause, despite the fact that owing to the differences in the levels of social development the stages of the development of their revolutions are different.
All the readers of Europe who are concerned about the destiny of Asia will gain a basic knowledge of New China from reading these short documents and particularly from reading the Sixty Article Common Program passed by the Chinese People’s Political Con-sultative Conference.
I believe that the effort which our comrades in Czecho-slovakia have exerted in helping European readers to understand New China is a contribution to the international revolutionary movement for which we must be grateful.

(Signed and dated) Letter to Peng Dehuai and the Northwest Bureau November 14, 1949 Comrade Dehuai22 and the Northwest Bureau: According to the information submitted repeatedly by the Qinghai Provin-cial [Party] Committee, the remnants of [the forces of ] Bandit Ma23 have been fanning up fires among the masses in many places and organizing a resistance.
At the imminent Lanzhou conference, please pay serious attention to this.
24 In having the various provincial, [special] district and xian [Party] committees focusing on the arduous job [of uniting and organizing] the masses and in all such work upholding [the principle of ] equality among the nationalities, the government organs at all levels should, in accordance with the size and ratio of [minority] nationality populations, allocate quotas and absorb in large numbers those members of the Hui nationality and other minority nationalities who are capable of cooperating with us into taking part in government work.
In the present period they should organize across the board coalition governments, i.
e.
, united front governments.
Within [the framework of ] such a cooperation, minority nationality cadres will be nurtured in large numbers.
Furthermore, the provincial [Party] committees of Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia and Shaanxi and the [special] district [Party] committees of all places where there are minority nationalities ought to form training classes for minority national-22.
Peng Dehui was at this time, deputy commander-in-chief of the PLA and first secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CC of the CPC.

Bandit Ma refers to Ma Bufang who was governor of Qinghai province under KMT Government in 1938-49.
In 1949 he became the head of China’s northwest headquarters.
However in late July of that year he fled to Hong Kong.
In spite of his physical absence (at the time of this letter) Ma continued to have influence over some forces in Qinghai prov-ince, mostly military leaders, who were previously associated with the KMT.

This refers to the enlarged meeting of the Northwest Bureau of the CC of the CPC, held in Lanzhou, in November 1949.
ity cadres, or cadre training schools.
Please give this a good deal of attention.
It is impossible to thoroughly resolve the problem of the minority nationalities and to totally isolate the nationalistic reactionaries without a large number of Communist cadres who are from minority nationality backgrounds.
Have all the comrades of the Northwest Bureau arrived in Lanzhou? On what day will your conference commence? The agenda for this conference is very full and I am afraid that the meeting must be held for a week or so.
You also need to make a decision as to where the political center of the Northwest should be located from now on — should it be in Xian? or Lanzhou? Please inform me of the major items on your agenda.
Please ask General Wang Zhen25 to report to us.

Having joined the Communist Youth League in 1927, Wang rose through the CPC ranks as a labor trainer and organizer.
In the early 1930s, having armed, organized labor groups in the Hunan area (groups which were later absorbed into the regular armed forces of the Communist Red Army), Wang began his career as a brilliant political officer of the Communist military units.
During the Long March, he reached northern Shaanxi as polit-ical commissar of the Sixth Army Corps under Xiao Ke.
In the late 1930s he led his troops in productive labor in the Yanan area, and he was considered a model officer whose soldiers were equally adept at productive work as at combat duties.
At the time of this letter the First Army Group under his command was pushing into Xinjiang.

Letter to Liu Yazi December 2, 1949 Dear Venerable Mr.
Liu:35 Your letter of November 4 has long been received.
I apologize for the fact that, owing to my hectic schedule, I have been so tardy in responding.
I have not seen the letter written in the train, but I thank you deeply for your warm and kind thoughts.
At a moment of convenience I will make an inquiry on your behalf on the matter of the book for inscription.
36 Mr.
Zhou37 indeed has 35.
Liu Yazi was an outstanding poet of the old school.
He was a scholar-revolutionary in the late Qing period and joined such associations as the Zhongguo jiaoyu hui (China Edu-cation Society) headed by Zhang Binglin and Wu Zhihui, and the Aiguo xueshe (Patriotic Study Association) headed by Cai Yuanpei, as well as Sun Yat-sen’s Tong meng hui.
During the May Fourth period Liu became a proponent of the new-style, vernacular (baihua) liter-ature and founded the Xin nan she (New Southern Society).
In the mid-1920s Liu became an active and moderately influential member of the KMT, but he opposed the rightward drift of the Party after Sun Yat-sen’s death.
Later Liu would avoid serving in the various KMT governments—both Chiang Kai-shek’s Nanjing government and later Wang Jing-wei’s Wuhan government.
Rather he dedicated himself to historical and literary pursuits and led a secluded life in Shanghai (briefly) and Hong Kong.
In 1941, as a result of his reaction to the New Fourth Army Incident, Liu was expelled from the KMT.
In the late-1940s Liu joined the Democratic League and formed the San min zhuyi tongzhi lianhe hui (Association of the Comrades of the Three People’s Principle) and, in 1948, the Kuo-mintang Revolutionary Committee.
He returned to Beijing in 1949 and was a member of the Government Administration Council of the new PRC government and of the standing committee of the National People’s Congress until his death of pneumonia in 1958.
Liu was one of the group of “democratic personages”.
Here Mao used the salutation lao to refer to Liu’s venerated status 36.
According to the source, this refers to a book Commemorative Volume I on the Yi Pavilion which Liu sent to Mao for inscription in 1949.
37.
This refers to Zhou Enlai.
Mao is employing a double-entendre here.
The saying he used, tu o zhi lao, is a derivation of the aphorism tu pu o fa, from the Lu Shijia (Chronicle of the House of Lu), Shi Ji (Historical Records), which describes the diligence of the his-torical figure Zhou Gong (Duke of Zhou) in ancient days, saying that he stopped in the middle of eating and had to hold his hair which had been disassembled in the middle of a bath in order to receive visitors and do business.
Mao apparently placed significance in the coincidence of the “name” Zhou here.
The Duke of Zhou was the chief minister of the founder of the great Zhou dynasty of ancient days, and Zhou Enlai, to whom Mao was ina very busy schedule of receiving visitors and official business, and perhaps he has forgotten it.
As for the [delay in the] matter of the literary and historical organization,38 it could perhaps be a result of the same problem.
Again, at my convenience I shall ask about it.

Directive Issued at the Fourth Meeting of the CPGC (Excerpts) December 2, 1949 [The national budget is a very important issue.
The policy of the entire na-tion is reflected in it because it delineates the scope and orientation of the gov-ernment’s activities.
Take, for example, the problem of providing support for all the former troops and former government and educational personnel which was raised in the draft of the rough estimate.
]39 This is precisely a problem of policy.
The People’s Government ought to adopt a responsible attitude toward this problem.
Only in this way can it be beneficial to the people.
[Our situ-ation can be summarized as follows:] There are difficulties, but there are also measures that can be taken, and there is hope.
There are difficulties in our fiscal situation.
We must explain to the people where our difficulties lie; we must not hide these difficulties.
At the same time, however, we must also explain to the people that we do indeed have the means to overcome the difficulties.
Since we have the means to overcome the difficulties, our cause is a hopeful one and our prospects are bright.
Our situation will improve year by year, and we project that next year will be better than this year.
Within a three-to-five-year period, our economy can be completely rehabilitated, and within eight to ten years our economy will be able to achieve a great development.

great importance that these organizational regulations be promulgated40.
These organizational regulations are precisely the general laws appropriate to the cur-rent period.
The various local people’s governments, although they may add [to these regulations] in accordance with concrete conditions [in their various localities], must implement them without exception.

China is a big country, only if we establish powerful local organs at such a level can things be done well.
What ought to be united, must be united; and there should by no means be any separate governance, each doing what he thinks is best.
However, there must be integration between [the notion of ] unification and [the notion of ] discretionary arrangements according to local conditions.
Under the regime of the people, the historical conditions of the past, in which regional occupation by the feudalist forces has been generated, have been eliminated.
The division of labor between the Center and the localities will be to our advantage and will in no way harm us.

Instruction on the Army’s Participation in Production and Construction Work in 195042 December 5, 1949 The People’s War of Liberation has basically won a nationwide victory.
With the exception of [units] on a few fronts which have to devote them-selves to pursuing and annihilating the remnant enemy forces so as to achieve a complete triumph, a large number of the troops of the People’s Liberation Army have already engaged in or are soon to begin to engage in, training and consolidation.
The Common Program of the People’s Political Consultative Conference provides that the armed forces of the People’s Republic of China shall, during peacetime, systematically take part in agricultural and industrial production in order to assist in the work of national construction, provided such work docs not interfere with their military duties.
Here, a glorious and formidable task is given to our people’s armed forces in addition to the great 40.

tasks of securing our national defense, reinforcing public order, and strength-ening [their own] training and consolidation.
Therefore, the People’s Revolu-tionary Military Council is calling on the entire army, with the exception of those [units] which are still engaged in fighting and logistics service, to shoul-der part of the task of production so that our People’s Liberation Army will not only be an army for national defense but also an army of production, in order to cooperate with all the people in the country in overcoming the difficulties left behind by long years of war and in accelerating the economic construction of [our] New Democracy.
This production task must and can be realized.
The reason that this production task must be realized is that the long war launched against the Chinese people by reactionaries both inside and outside of our country has caused the people serious hardships and has severely dam-aged the economy.
Today, we want to carry the revolutionary war through to the end and heal the wounds left by the long periods of war; we must under-take the work of construction in all areas of [our] economy, our culture, and [our] national defense.
The state’s revenue is inadequate, but its expenditure is huge.
This is the one major difficulty we are facing today.
The way to overcome this kind of difficulty is first to have the entire people, under the leadership of the Central People’s Government, restore and develop production step by step; and as for the People’s Liberation Army, it must assume the responsibility for a set [share] of the task of production.
Only by doing this can it join the people of the entire country in overcoming this difficulty.
The reason that this production task can be realized is that the overwhelm-ing majority of [the personnel in] the People’s Liberation Army come from among the laboring people.
They have a high degree of political consciousness and all kinds of production skills.
Furthermore, during the most difficult years and months of the War of Resistance against Japan, they shouldered the tasks of production and a tradition of labor.
The vast numbers of cadres and veteran fighters of the People’s Liberation Army all understand that after the troops have participated in production, not only will difficulties be overcome, govern-ment expenditures decreased, and army life improved, but also, the political quality of the army will be raised through the tempering of labor, and the relations between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people will be improved.
[Another] reason that this production task can be realized is that in areas where fighting has ended, in addition to assuming such tasks as securing national defense, cleaning out bandits, consolidating public order,and strengthening training, the People’s Liberation Army now has spare time to take part in production and construction work.
All these things are the fac-tors which make it possible for the People’s Liberation Army to carry out the task of production.
The participation of the People’s Liberation Army in production is not a temporary measure; it should proceed from the perspective of long-range con-struction.
The emphasis is on increasing the nation’s wealth through labor.
Beginning in the spring of 1950, the heads of all military regions must there-fore direct their subordinates to put into effect [a program of ] participating in production and construction work in order to improve their own livelihood and to save a portion of the state’s expenditure.
This production and construc-tion work ought to become a kind of movement in order to facilitate its wider adoption.
A relatively long-term plan and concrete measures [for implementa-tion] should be formulated for this type of production work.
With the approv-al of the people’s government, the categories of [such] production should stay within the confines of agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, water conser-vation projects, handicraft industries, and transportation projects which [the army] is capable of undertaking.
Commercial undertakings are forbidden.
The leading organs of the army [unit] should carry out investigations and studies [for production] based on the conditions of the places where they are stationed and complete the preparation this winter.
Based on experience, the army’s production movement must strictly pro-hibit the opening up of shops and engaging in commercial activities.
If among the cadres there should be ideas of seeking quick profits by attempting to smuggle, hoard, and speculate, or if such activities are discovered, they must be corrected and stopped quickly, for they not only violate the correct production guidelines and disrupt economic order, but will invariably [cause] graft and corruption to occur and will destroy our own comrades.
These activities are not tolerated by law.
Moreover, in undertaking agricultural production, we must be careful not to cause floods as a result of reclaiming wasteland or incur the people’s dissatisfaction by competing for land.
So that the army may carry out its production tasks correctly and develop its production movement, it is hereby stipulated that: 1) At levels above division, army, and military sub-region, representative committees should be formed of representatives from the general headquarters, political departments, and logistic service departments.
Their tasks are to take charge of the direction of production, to examine and approve productionplans, to supervise the implementation of production plans, and to investigate illegal activities.
2) Producers’ cooperatives are to be established in the army.
Organs of lead-ership for these cooperatives should also be established at every level which, under the supervision and guidance of the army production committees, will control the disposition of all production funds, production activities, and fruits of production.
The system of the cooperatives and the army’s command system are to be parallel.
They will maintain close relations with each other, but they are not to be confused with each other.
3) Implement [the principle of ] taking both public and private interests] into consideration and distributing on a fair and reasonable basis] the net in-come from production.
Forty percent should go to the individual producers; the rest should go to the production units and the stale in order to establish the revolutionary way of running the affairs of one’s own household as well as those of the public.
On the one hand, this will make the army partially self-sufficient, while on the other, it will allow the individual producer to have some income.
This individual income may be kept by the individual for private use, or be sent home to the family for its use, or be deposited in the cooperative in reserve [for future use]; [the choice should be] at the discretion of the individual.
In areas where there is a shortage of land, in addition to participating, whenever possible, in all kinds of handicraft industries, water conservation, transportation, and construction projects, heads of army units may talk things over with the local people’s governments and, on the condition that the peas-ants’ own willingness is not violated, contribute the army’s labor funds, fertil-izer, and farm tools to cultivating the land jointly with the peasants in order to increase production and share the fruits equitably.
However, it is necessary to make sure that this is not carried out through coercion, and that [the army] docs not compete with the people for benefits.
The production plans of the units in all military regions must be integrated with the production plans of the people’s governments of all the provinces and of all the greater administrative areas.
[There should be] coordination in the use of production funds.
All the production funds of the army units should be treated as investment, so interest must be computed and dates set for repay-ment.
All the army’s production enterprises should pay taxes according to the rules and observe all laws and regulations of the people’s governments, and no violations will be permitted.
It is hoped that all heads of military regions will pay strict attention to theabove items.
They must make sure that our People’s Liberation Army’s pro-duction and construction work in 1950 attains remarkable results.
They must, moreover, conduct check-ups all the time and rectify errors and deficiencies that may arise.
On their part, the people’s governments in all areas have the responsibility of providing guidance and assistance in the production work of the army units in their areas.

Speech on Arrival at Moscow Train Station December 16, 1949 Dear Comrades and Friends: For me to have the opportunity at this time to visit the capital of the Soviet Union, the first great socialist country in the world, is a very happy event in my life.
A deep friendship exists between the peoples of [our] two great coun-tries, China and the Soviet Union.
After the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet government, following the policies of Lenin and Stalin, took the lead in abrogating the unequal treaties [concluded] with China under Imperial Russia.
Over a period of almost thirty years, the Soviet people and the Soviet government have, on several occasions, assisted the Chinese people in their cause of liberation.
The Chinese people will never forget that in the midst of their ordeals they received such fraternal friendship of the Soviet people and the Soviet government.
The important tasks for the present are consolidating the world peace front headed by the Soviet Union and opposing those who stir up war as well as consolidating relations between our two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, and developing the friendship of the Chinese and Soviet peoples.
I am confident that with the victory of the Chinese People’s Revolution and the founding of the Chinese People’s Republic, with the joint efforts of the New Democracies and the peace-loving peoples of the world, with the common aspirations and close cooperation of [our] two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, and especially with the correct international policies of Genera-lissimo Stalin, these tasks will certainly be fully carried out and excellent results will be attained.

Comment on Democratic Personages43 Winter 1949 Let me add two more phrases for you, namely: “Better to be a counter-revolutionary than to merely keep out of the revolution.
” .
.
.
Don’t think you deserve preferential treatment because of your achievements in war.
You must know that one democratic personage is possibly worth an army.
By winning one Li Jishen44 over to our side, we probably saved the lives of twenty or thirty 43.
The Shengping Ziliao introduced this comment with the following: “In the Winter [of 1949] certain middle-echelon cadres in Beijing felt greatly resentful at the high wages and benefits given to democratic personages in contrast to what they themselves earned.
Playing on the theme that Li Jishen [a former KMT general] was paid an amount equaling 5,000 catties of millet a month they chanted the slogan: “Better to join revolution late than to have joined it early, better still, not to have joined it at all”.
Mao’s comment here is ostensi-bly his response to the situation.
44.
Li Jishen (1886-1959) was commander of the Fourth Army of the Nationalist forces in 1925-26.
Although he often held high posts in the KMT military command, his relations with the Chiang Kai-shek dominated wing of the KMT had been strained and unstable since the Northern Expedition period.
In 1929, when he attempted to mediate the dispute between Chiang and the Guangxi clique (Li Zongren, Bai Congxi), he was expelled from the KMT.
After the Japanese attacked Changchun (Mukden) in 1931, and Chiang was forced from office, the Guangxi faction was restored and Li with them.
Later, when Chiang returned to power in the KMT, Li was relegated to ex-officio duties in Guangzhou.
In late 1933 he became chairman of the People’s Revolutionary Government in Fuzhou which actively opposed the authority of the Nanjing KMT (Chiang) government.
When that opposition was suppressed and the Fuzhou government dissolved, Li fled to Hong Kong, with a KMT arrest warrant out for him.
In 1935 he and others founded the Chinese Peo-ple’s Revolutionary League, seeking to unite the various political factions against Japan, but also in opposition to Nanjing.
This was dissolved in 1937.
In 1938 he was restored to membership in the KMT and continued to hold high military advisory positions.
However, he largely operated on a local level in Guangxi in organizing military opposition to the Japanese rather than assuming his official positions in the Chongqing government.
In 1947 he went to Hong Kong and on March 8 of that year issued a statement urging the KMT and the Communists to settle their differences and end the civil war.
On August 6 he wasthousand comrades and won the military victory one or two years ahead of time.

Now we will simply do it this way; this is also the only way we can do it, whether you approve of it or not.

Conversation with a Painter from the Soviet Union (Excerpts) 1949 [The Soviet painter inquires of Mao whether or not it would be too exhaust-ing if they worked, i.
e.
, if Mao posed for the portrait, from nine to eleven pm each day] I usually work in the nighttime as well.
This is a habit cultivated through many years of working underground.
Let me now accompany you for break-fast, and then we shall start.
We need a portfolio of this type of drawings about People’s China, or a series of paintings… That is correct.
In terms of their nature, the Chinese people are diligent, hardworking, and persevering However, in addition [to the fact that it is in their nature] this diligence and perseverance is also linked to the most cruel exploitation and extreme deprivation of rights suffered by the Chinese people for so many centuries.
The hard life itself has forced them to pay the price, in every kind of work, of giving it their greatest labor, just so that they can feed themselves and continue to live.
As for culture, we the Chinese people consider ourselves to be the most backward.
Our culture is in this state because in the past there has not been in China an organized force or thought which has been able to unite the whole people and to direct their energy toward the correct path [of development].
Today, the Chinese Communist Party has taken this expelled from the KMT for the last time, and in January 1948 he became the chairman of the newly constituted Revolutionary Committee of the KMT.
He went to Beijing in early 1949 and was appointed to the Preparatory Committee for the CPPCC.
In September 1949 he became a vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC and in Octo-ber on the founding of the PRC, he became one of six vice-chairmen of the Central People’s Government and vice-president of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

At present, the Com-munist Party of China and the Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of China are switching to peaceful economic construction.
Q: How long will you be staying in the Soviet Union, Mr.
Mao? A: I plan to stay for a few weeks.
The length of my stay in the Soviet Union will be partly determined by the time it will take to resolve the various prob-lems related to the interests of the People’s Republic of China.
Q: Would it be possible to learn what problems you have in mind? A: Foremost among these are the matters of the current Treaty of Friendship and Alliance between China and the Soviet Union,47 and of the Soviet Union’s 45.

The “current” Treaty of Friendship and Alliance between China and the Soviet Union to which Mao refers here is the treaty signed on August 14, 1945, between the Nationalist government and the Soviet Union.
This treaty was abrogated on February 14, 1950, when a new treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance was signed by the two countries and ratified and put into effect in April of the same year.
Aside from agreements on postal and telecommunication services, six agreements were reached during Mao’s visit to the Soviet Union.
The agreements signed on February 14, 1950 were: 1) The treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual assistance.
2) The agreement of Joint administration of the China-Changchun Railway and ofloan to the People’s Republic of China and the matter of trade and of a trade agreement between our two countries.
There are also other questions.
Furthermore, I also plan to visit various localities and cities in the Soviet Union in order to gain a better understanding of economic and cultural con-struction in the Soviet state.

It is plain to see that the unity of the people of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, solidified by treaty, will be permanent and inviolable, and one which cannot be put asunder by anyone.
Moreover, this unity will not only influence the prosperity of these two great countries, China and the Soviet Union but will surely also affect the future of humanity and the triumph of peace and justice all over the world.
During our sojourn in the Soviet Union we have visited many factories and farms.
We have seen the great achievements of the workers, peasants and intel-lectuals of the Soviet Union in their undertaking of socialist construction; we have observed the work-style of combining a spirit of revolution with a spirit of realism and practicality which has been nurtured among the people of the Soviet Union through the teaching of Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union50.
This has confirmed the conviction which the Chi-nese Communists have always held: that the experience of the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction and its experience in construction in other major areas will serve as an example for the construction of New China.
We have received warm and enthusiastic hospitality in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, and in Leningrad, birthplace of the October Revolution.
As we leave this great capital of socialism, we wish particularly to express our sincerest gratitude to Generalissimo Stalin and to the government and people of the Soviet Union.

Reply to Ambassador of the People’s Republic of Romania March 10, 1950 Mr.
Ambassador: I am very glad to accept the letter of credence from the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the People’s Republic of Romania presented by Your Excellency and I am grateful to Your Excellency for your congratulations and good wishes.
The resolute struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries undertaken by the Romanian people since the world war against fascism and their current industrious efforts in the work of economic construction in which glorious achievements have already been reaped have always been regarded with deep and sincere concern and admiration by the Chinese people.
Today, the governments and peoples of the two nations of China and Ro-mania are fighting arduously and heroically for their common goal of world peace.
We believe that the increasingly close cooperation of the two countries, China and Romania, in the political, economic, and cultural spheres will sure-ly benefit the people of the two countries and will further consolidate and reinforce the strength of the camp for the world democracy and peace.
I warmly welcome Your Excellency as the first ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the People’s Republic of Romania to the People’s Re-public of China, and pledge to Your Excellency all my assistance in your work of consolidating the friendship between the two nations.
Best wishes for the prosperity of your country, the prosperity of your people and the good health of your head of state.

With regard to the bad things that have come into practice in the requisition of grain, the government has already issued several decrees for the purpose of correcting them; I wonder if the situation has become somewhat more relaxed lately? The trouble of the bandits must be quelled and the chief villains must be dealt with; this is a fixed principle.
Nonetheless in carrying out the quelling and the dealing with [the chief villains] we must have a strategy and specific steps and measures, so that [the problem] may be resolved speedily and the situation throughout the country may be secured and stabilized.
I hear that the trouble caused by the bandits has been on the whole resolved as far as Hunan is con-cerned.

Comment on Chen Yun’s Report63 April 14, 1950 The Financial and Economic Affairs Commission of the Government Ad-ministrative Council has achieved very significant results in the past six months in the work of adjusting the budget and stabilizing the prices of goods.
The policies of the Financial and Economic affairs Commission are correct [even though] there are still some shortcomings in its work, and attention should be paid to correcting these.
The financial situation of our country has begun to change for the better.
This is a very good phenomenon.
However, for the financial and economic situation as a whole to take a fundamental change for the better three condi-tions must be met.
These are: the completion of land reform, the reasonable adjustment of existing industries and commercial concerns, and major reduc-tions in the military and governmental expenditures of the state.
We should strive to realize these step by step, and they can indeed be completely realized.
Then fundamental changes for the better can take place.
Within the next few months, the emphasis in the work of the organs of the government that are in charge of finance and the economy should be on the adjustment of the inter-relationship between public and private enterprises and between the various departments within each public or private enterprise and on exerting as much effort as possible to overcome the state of anarchy.

Letter to Mao Yimin May 8, 1950 Comrade Yimin:80 Your letter of January 3 has been received.
Thank you for your good wishes and for giving me so many details about the conditions in our native village.
The poor people in our home village lead a very hard life, and life is even harder for the families of [revolutionary] martyrs.
For the time being, all they can do is be a bit patient, and things could become somewhat better after the land reform.
By then the People’s Government may also give some assistance to the people such as loans, and the people will be able to gradually make im-provements in their lives.
Taking care of the families of martyrs is a national issue.
There are several million households of martyrs’ families throughout the country, and they all have to be taken care of.
It would not be wise for us to give special and indi-vidual attention to a few places.
Nonetheless, with regard to the people in the greatest difficulties, the local people’s government should, during the time of rent reduction and land reform, or in the in-between-season months,81 give them as much attention and care as possible.
It is very good that you are working in our home village.
You can write to me often and tell me what is going on in the village.
Please give my regards to the comrades in the village.
I sincerely hope that everyone will work, hard and make progress.

The two countries, China and India, share a common boundary and have had between them a long-lasting and intimate relationship historically and culturally.

The understanding, sympathy, and concern that exist between the peoples of our two countries is profound and sincere.
The establishment of formal diplomat-ic relations between China and India now will not only cause the friendship that already exists between the people of these two countries to grow and be consolidated with the passing of each day, but moreover, the sincere cooper-ation between the people of these two great Asian countries produced by this friendship will surely contribute greatly to lasting peace in Asia and the world.

They have said things that express discontent with the work of the local district and xiang government.
I wonder what the real situation is? If it is possible, please send a comrade down to investigate a bit and let me know the results.
The Wen brothers are all poor peasants, but in their letters they speak in favor of the landlords and the rich peasants.
Why is this so? Please also investigate this and let me know.
As far as the question of the difficulties that the Wen family (my uncle’s family) has encountered and their appeal for aid and relief, you can help them relieve their problem only insofar as the normal pattern of rent reduction and land reform, which is com-mon to all peasants, will allow.
You cannot give them special attention and aid, or else the people in general will be unhappy about it.

Liu Yanan was at the time of this letter head of Xiangxiang xian, Hunan Province.
98.
See Letter to Wen Nansong, p.
64 of this volume.
I have read [the enclosed] document.
99 I find it very well written and very useful.
I am suggesting some revisions for your consideration.
The part on the rich peasants is too long, so much so that it is turning out to be unclear instead.
In some places [this section] is not very appropriate; therefore I would, and have, deleted a major portion of it.
I have added [a description of ] the experi-ence of the period from 1946 on in order to rectify a certain misunderstanding that some cadres already [appear to] have100—[i.
e.
, a misunderstanding] that the “Left” deviationist errors of the past have been the result of the stipu-lation in the Land Reform Law Outline Program promulgated on October 10, 1947101, that the surplus land and property of the rich peasants is to be confiscated.
Without such an explanation [as I have included] it would not be possible to correct this misunderstanding.
By the forces of production we are referring to two things—the laborers and to the material of production (also known as the means of production).
102 By the material of production, in the countryside, the first thing we mean is land, second the farming implements, draft animals, houses, and so on.
103 Grain is what the peasants produce as a means of living by utilizing the material of production.
It is reasonable for us to put the grain confiscated from the land-lords and other confiscated things together and put them under the category of the material of production, because this type of grain contains the character of capital funds.
By the relations of production, we mean the relationships of ownership which people have [with each other] with regard to the material of production, or in other words, the relations of the ownership of property.
99.
This refers to the draft of the report which Liu eventually made to the Second Session of the First National Conference of the CPPCC on the question of land reform.
100.
Mao added a very long paragraph to Liu’s draft here.
101.
See Present Situation and Our Tasks, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume IV.
102.
Here Mao used the terms shengchan ziliao and shengchan shouduan; the former is trans-lated in this document as “material of production” and the latter as “means of production” in order to preserve Mao’s distinction here.
It is an exception rather than the rule, since it is a general practice to render shengchan ziliao as “means of production,” and elsewhere in this collection we, as a rule, followed this custom.
103.
Here the term “houses” refers to buildings that are used as means of production, while residential buildings were considered by Mao to be part of the means of living (shenghua ziliao).
In the first chapter of the Stipulations of the Central Committee of the CPC on the Distinction of Social Classes in the Land Reform and on Their Various Treatments Mao had pointed out: “In order to live people must produce the means of living, such as grain, clothing, houses, fuel and implements.
In order to produce the means of living, people must have the means of production, such as land, raw material, draft animals, implements and a workplace.
”The utilization of the material of production—e.
g.
the utilization (renting) of the land of the landlords by the peasants—is nothing but the result of the relationship of ownership that the landlords have with regard to the land.
This type of ownership relationship is expressed as the relationship of subjugation that the tenant peasant has with regard to the landlord (i.
e.
, an interhuman relationship), and this is [what we mean by] the relations of production.
In the past many comrades have committed errors on this matter of casting their thinking in a dualistic, or even a pluralistic, mode and considering the relations of production in parallel with the relations of utilization and at the same time considering the material [or means] of production in parallel with the means of living.
In using this [frame of mind] as the standard for drawing class dis-tinctions they have made the question very confusing and made mistakes in classifying the class backgrounds of many people.
In the winter of 1947 I asked Qiaomu to write an article entitled “Stipulations on the Various Social Classes and Their Treatment in China.
”104 The first two chapters of that article were written by me, and it clarified this problem.
You may consult it.

Opening Speech at the Second Meeting of the National Committee of the CPPCC June 14, 1950 Fellow committee members, comrades, and friends: The Second Meeting of the National Committee of the People’s Political Consultative Conference is now in session.
At this meeting there will be re-ports on the work of the National Committee, on land reform work, on eco-nomic and fiscal work, on taxation work, on diplomatic and United Front work, on cultural and educational work, on military work, and on the workof the courts.
We hope that these matters will be discussed.
Of these [various issues], the central issue for this meeting is the problem of land reform.
We hope that a land reform bill will be adopted at this meeting and that it might be implemented after being ratified by the Central People’s Government.
The first thing this would do would be to enable the more than 100,000 cadres who are in the midst of preparing to carry out land reform to get an early start in studying this bill, so that after this autumn the work of reforming the land [tenure] system may be carried out smoothly throughout an area with an agricultural population of about 100 million.
Naturally, all the other reports are also important.
Any opinions that one may have may be voiced, and any proposal may be submitted for examination and discussion.
So long as they are practicable, they ought to be adopted.
We have the great and correct Common Program as our standard for reviewing our work and discussing problems.
The Common Program must be fully implemented, as it is presently the organic law of our country.
I am convinced that through the efforts of all our comrades our meeting will be able to accomplish its tasks smoothly.
At the present mo-ment, under the leadership of the Central People’s Government, the people of the entire country are in the midst of undertaking immense tasks, struggling to overcome difficulties and to strive for a turn for the better in the economic situation.
All of the people’s enterprises in our country are now developing in a forward direction along new paths, and with each new day we can see progress and success.
No difficulty of any sort can hinder the advance of the people’s cause.
The People’s Political Consultative Conference and the National Com-mittee it has elected are great political organizations of the United Front that unite all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people’s organizations, and democratic personages from all walks of life throughout the country.
They enjoy very high prestige among the people of the country.
We must consolidate this type of unity, consolidate our United Front, and lead the people of the entire country in steadily attaining their own goals.

Speech at Eighth Session of the CPGC June 28, 1950 The Chinese people declared long ago that the affairs of all countries in the world should be managed by these countries themselves, and that the affairs of Asia should be managed by the peoples of Asia themselves, not by the United States of America.
American aggression against Asia can only arouse wide-spread and resolute resistance by the peoples of Asia.
It was only on January 5 of this year that Truman announced that the United States would not inter-vene in Taiwan.
Now he himself has proved that [statement] to be a [pack of lies], and moreover, he has torn to shreds all international agreements regard-ing the nonintervention of the United States in the internal affairs of China.
This exposure by the United States of its own imperialist face is advantageous to the people of China and the peoples of Asia.
There is absolutely no grounds for the United States’ intervention in the internal affairs of countries such as Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
The sympathy of the entire Chinese peo-ple and of the broad masses of the people throughout the world will be on the side of the victims of aggression and certainly not on the side of American imperialism.
They will neither be enticed by the imperialists’ bribes nor cowed by their threats.
Imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly feeble because it does not have the support of the people.
Our people, and people all over the world, unite and be fully prepared to crush any provocation by the American imperialists! Source People’s Daily, June 29, 1950.
Reply to Ambassador of the People’s Republic of Mongolia July 3, 1950 Mr.
Ambassador: I accept with great pleasure the letter of credence from the Presidium of the Lesser Hural of the People’s Republic of Mongolia which Your Excellency has presented and am grateful to Your Excellency for your warm congratulations and good wishes.
An intimate relationship had originally existed between the peoples of Chi-na and Mongolia.
[However,] in the last few decades, owing to the seeds of discord sown among us by the imperialists and the reactionary government in China, communications between us were severed.
The Mongolian people, under the influence of the October Revolution, not only had already freed themselves early of the reactionary government of China and established a true People’s Democracy, but also are advancing along the road of development in economic and cultural construction.
The Chinese people wholeheartedly celebrate and salute this success on the part of the Mongolian people.
Now, the Chinese people’s revolution has achieved a fundamental victory, and dip-lomatic relations between China and Mongolia have been established.
I am convinced that this will not only bring about the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the peoples of our two countries, but will also facilitate [the growth of ] a lasting peace in Asia and the world.
I warmly welcome Your Excellency as the first Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the People’s Republic of Mongolia to the People’s Re-public of China and pledge to Your Excellency my assistance in your work of strengthening the cooperation between our two nations.
Best wishes for the prosperity of your country, the prospering of your peo-ple, and the good health of your head of state.

In their struggle for liberation in 1921-24, the Mongolian people, under the leader-ship of the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party, drove out the Russian White guard bandit troops and the armed forces of the Northern warlords of China, both of which were backed by Japanese imperialism, overthrew Mongolian feudal rule and founded the Mon-golian People’s Republic.
the national congress of the Socialist Unity Party of the great German Dem-ocratic Republic, for an early end to the phenomenon of the forced division of the whole of Germany by the imperialists, for the early establishment of an integrated, unified, and democratic Germany, and for an early liberation of the entire German nation under the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party and the Communist Party of Germany.

Reply to Ambassador of the Union of Burma August 7, 1950 Mr.
Ambassador: I am very pleased to accept the letter of credence from the President of the Union of Burma presented by Your Excellency and am grateful to Your Excel-lency for your felicitations and good wishes.
The two countries, China and Burma, share a common boundary, and not only is there a close relationship between them historically and culturally, but there is also a deep fraternal friendship between the peoples of the two coun-tries.
In recent centuries, the people of both China and Burma have under-taken protracted and courageous struggles for the independence and liberty of their respective nations.
Therefore, the sympathy and [mutual] understanding that exist between our peoples are also very profound.

I also believe that it will facilitate the growth of a lasting peace in Asia and in the world.

Comments on Suppressing and Liquidating Counterrevolutionaries September 27, 1950 [The policy of ] not executing a single [secret agent] and not arresting the majority of them is a policy to which we must adhere in the current struggle against secret agents.
If not a single secret agent is to be executed, they will dare to make a clean breast of things; by not arresting the majority among them, only a small number [of cases] will have to be handled by the security organs, while the majority can be handled by the various [government offices] and schools themselves.
We must make the Party committees in all the localities adhere to this policy.
Party leadership should be particularly stressed in security work, which in practice should be put under the direct leadership of the Party committee; otherwise there would be danger.

Letter to Hu Qiaomu November 22, 1950 Comrade Qiaomu: Please draft a directive in the name of the Central Committee to amend our shortcomings in the practice of sending telegram messages.
For example: we should no longer use such words as zi, chou, ren, mou, dong, dong, jiang, ji, etc.
, in lieu of the month and date.
Instead, we should write down the com-plete month and date123 [of the telegram], as, for instance, November 22.
In general, for the signature we should use our full names, and not write the last [family] name and not the first [personal] name.
In only those cases where the 123.
Zi, chou, ren and mou are the first 4 of the 12 di ji (or earth branches) in the duo-decimal cycle.
This cycle is combined in permutation with the decimal cycle known as the tiangan (Heavenly Cardinals) cycle to make up the sexagenary cycle which is used in tradi-tional China to designate the years and other elements of time.
This sexagenary cycle is also known as the jiazi system (taking the first of each cycle) and the ganji system.
The decimal system is also used for designating common serial things such as grades, while the duodec-imal cycle is commonly used to designate hour periods in the day.
Dong, dong, jiang, ji are the first four of the rhyme keys (yun mu) in the ping segment of the conventional rhyming patterns for Chinese traditional poetry.
In the past, when the Chinese sent telegrams, they would conventionally use the duodecimal cycle’s items in sequence to indicate the twelve months, and the rhyme keys to represent the dates within each month.
receiver of the message is entirely aware of the person [who sent the message] would it be permissible to use the last name without the first, such as “Liu-Deng,” “Chen-Rao,” etc.
124 For locales and the titles of the offices or organs [from which the telegrams are sent], they should in general be written out completely, and only in extremely rare cases would it be permissible to use such [traditional] provincial designations as Jing, Jin, Hu, Han.
125 Also, in terms of syntax we must learn to be grammatical and must ban the practice of omitting the subject, or the predicate, or other indispensable nouns, and where we use adjectives and adverbs we should be able to distinguish between their usage and character.
Please take the lead in this matter and write up a preliminary draft and then invite Yang Shangkun, Li Dao, Qi Yanming, Xue Muqiao,126 and other comrades whom you believe to be necessary to be invited [to join in this endeavor], hold one or two meetings with them and revise [the draft] and give it more substance, then send it to me for my perusal.

Xue is also a very productive writer of textbooks on China’s new economics and the chief CPC Party spokesperson for its economic policies.
Comment on Hearing of Mao Anying’s Death127 November 1950 “In war there must be sacrifice.
Without sacrifices there will be no victory.
To sacrifice my son or other people’s sons are just the same.
There are no par-ents in the world who do not treasure their children.
But please do not feel sad on my behalf, because this is something entirely unpredictable.
”128 We understand the hows and whys of these things.
There are so many com-mon folk whose children have shed their blood and were sacrificed for the sake of the revolution.
They are in need of consolation, and we ought to pay more attention to showing them greater concern.

Telegram to Participants of Demonstration in Tianjin December 2, 1950 To Messrs.
Li Zhuchen, Bi Mingqi, and Zhu Jisheng, chairman and deputy chairmen of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and to our 42,989 patriotic countrymen who took part in the great demon-stration, parade, and rally to Resist United States [Aggression] and Aid Korea, Protect the Home and Defend the Homeland, undertaken by the industrial and commercial circles in the municipality of Tianjin: I have read the telegram that you sent me on November 30.
You have clearly recognized the reactionary nature of the aggression that the United States’ im-perialists have launched against China and Korea.
You have not been duped by them; nor have you been cowed by their threats; instead you have taken a de-termined stand on the patriotic premise of resisting United States [aggression], aiding Korea, protecting your homes, and defending the homeland and have held a righteous demonstration and parade on November 30.
This is worthy of our acclaim.
The American imperialists have carried out a lot of decep-tive propaganda among the Chinese people, and no patriot should believe in these false arguments.
The American imperialists have invaded Korea, invaded China’s [province] Taiwan, bombarded the north-eastern part of China, and moreover have employed all sorts of hooligan tactics to threaten the Chinese people.
All patriots should be resolute in their resistance to the aggression of the American imperialists and should not succumb to their threats.
The heroic deeds of the Chinese People’s Volunteers to resist United States [Aggression], Aid Korea, Protect the Home, and Defend the Homeland, are worthy of out praise and admiration.
It is absolutely correct for all patriotic people among the workers, peasants, intellectuals, industrialists, and business people throughout the nation to unite together and resist the aggression of American imperialism.
I hope that all patriotic industrialists and business people in the whole of Chi-na will join with broad masses of the people and knit themselves into a united front against imperialist aggression that is even more consolidated than before.
This will signify that the Chinese people are bound to achieve final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression.

Letter to Chen Shutong December 18, 1950 Dear Venerated Mr.
Shu[tong]:132 I have received and read your letter, and have spoken with Comrades Chen Yun and Bo Yibo133 about the matter, asking them to think about how it can be handled.
There are some five million industrial and commercial units in the country, of which approximately three million are in the commercial area.
At a time when the economic enterprise (of the nation) as a whole is to be switched from the old tracks to the new track of New Democracy, it is inevitable that large numbers of commercial firms and handicraft industrial units will need to be reorganized or re-channeled into other trades.
The government should give good guidance in this matter.
Allow me to pay me respects and wish you good health.

Telegram to the Communist Party of France December 23, 1950 Dear Comrade Duclos and all comrades of the Communist Party of France: It is with great elation that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Commu-nist Party of France.
In its thirty years of hard struggle, the Communist Party of France has proved that it is the most faithful defender of the interests of the working class of France and the entire French people.
The Communist Party of France and the working class of France are at present uniting with the entire French people to oppose resolutely the war plans of the government of the United States of America.
This plan is aimed at turning the French people into slaves and sacrificial victims for the monopoly capitalists of the United States.
The Communist Party of China is resolute in its conviction that the strug-gle of the Communist Party of France is just and that it is bound to be victo-rious in the end.
Long live the unity of the Chinese and French peoples in their common struggle against the aggression of American imperialism.
Long live the Communist Party of France, which is faithful to the interests of the working class of France and of the international working class, and long live its leader, Comrade Maurice Thorez.
Long live Comrade Stalin, leader of the working class and progressive hu-manity throughout the world! (Signed as Chairman of CPC) Source: People’s Daily, December 27, 1950.

I am also paying more attention to getting some more rest and eating correctly.
In any case, as you said, if we take these things to be big things and serious things, and not as small and insignif-icant things, we stand a chance of correcting them.

Huang Ren: [Huang Ren Lao]:146 I have just sent to you a piece of intelligence on correcting [the policy] of unlimited leniency in Guangdong.
Now [with this letter] I forward another set [of similar intelligence] on Guangxi.
Please read and consult them.
These two places are the most typical examples.
Other areas are not as extreme as they arc, but in general they are not too far off; there has been a very common phenom-enon of causing the dissatisfaction of the masses.
If the bandit leaders and the repeat offenders are not executed, the bandits cannot be cleanly eliminated, and instead, there will be more and more bandits for us to eliminate.
If we do not execute the [local] tyrants, the peasant associations cannot be formed and the peasants will not dare to divide up the land.
If we do not execute the chief secret agents, then we will see more and more cases of sabotage and murder.
In any case, with regard to the bandit leaders, [local tyrants] and (the chief ) secret agents, we have to adopt a resolute policy of suppression, and only then can the peasants turn around147 and the people’s political power be consolidated.
Naturally, with regard to those people who may be executed but do not have to be executed, we should sentence them to terms of imprisonment or turn them over to the masses to be held in probationary supervision and reform them through labor and not execute them.
Just as there should be a limit to leniency, there should also be a limit to suppression; it would be wrong to not set a limit 146.

Comments on Suppressing and Liquidating Counterrevolutionaries March 24, 1951 The suppression of counterrevolutionaries is a great struggle.
Only after this is accomplished can political power be consolidated.
The suppression of counterrevolutionaries consists of [the suppression of ] (1) counterrevolutionaries in society; (2) counterrevolutionaries concealed among the old personnel and new intellectuals in the military and government systems; and (3) counterrevolutionaries concealed within the Party.
In order to suppress the counterrevolutionaries in these three areas, we must, of course, proceed a step at a time, and we cannot do it simultaneously.
However, with regard to certain crucial departments in the Party, in the government, and in the military, and in particular, with regard to the public security department, it is necessary to clean out [counterrevolutionaries] promptly, it is absolutely essential that suspicious elements be dealt with so that these organs may be placed in the hands of reliable personnel.

If Part 2 has already been published, then revisions can be made when the pamphlet version is printed.

Mao made the following three revisions/additions to Li Da’s Explanation: 1) Mao added a paragraph of some five lines length to the part where Li Da described the Chinese people’s spontaneous anti-foreign struggles; 2) Mao added a comment to the part where Li Da discussed the absence of anti-im-perialism in the 1911 Revolutionary Movement and in the proposals of Sun Yat-sen, its leader.
Mao’s comment was to the effect that although the 1911 Revolution carried within itself the effect of opposing the imperialists—in that it overthrew “the imperial-ists’ running dogs,”—the revolutionaries of the time did not consciously recognize it as a principle of anti-imperialism; 3) Mao amended a sentence that described the substance and significance of rationalism and empiricism within materialism; 153.

Yousheng:155 I am very happy to receive your letter of March 14.
You are too modest in your letter; please do not be so modest.
If it is by the agreement of the masses ince, and proclaimed the founding of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.
Proceeding north-ward from Guangxi, their peasant army attacked and occupied Hunan and Hubei in 1852.
In 1853 it marched through Jiangxi and Anhui and captured Nanjing.
A section of the forces then continued the drive north and pushed on to the vicinity of Tianjin.
However, the Taiping army failed to build stable base areas in the places it occupied; moreover, after establishing its capital in Nanjing, its leading group committed many political and military errors.
Therefore it was unable to withstand the combined onslaughts of the counterrevo-lutionary forces of the Ching government and the British, US and French aggressors, and was finally defeated in 1864.

The intended revisions were not made when Volume I of Mao Zedong Xuanji (Selected Works of Mao Zedong) was published.

Peng Yousheng was a one-time colleague of Mao’s in the New Hunan Revolutionary Army.
that you have been classified as a poor peasant, that is very good.
As for work and employment, if you can manage in the countryside, it would be better if you stayed there or at least stayed in the countryside for a time, because I am afraid that if you ventured out it may be difficult for you to find a suitable position.
If things indeed are very very difficult, you may bring this letter to Changsha and look up Mr.
Cheng Xingling, Vice-chairman of the Hunan Provincial People’s Government, and ask his direction and advice as to whether or not there are ways in which he may help you.
I cannot guarantee that there will be results, since Mr.
Cheng and the other comrades do not know you well and know nothing of your past or your recent circumstances.
Even I myself am in that situation, so it would not be proper for me to suggest any concrete opinion to them.
If you are willing to take the trip, you may want to give it a try.
When you go, you can report to him about the fact that you had once worked in the Hunan army during the period of the Xinhai (1911) Revolution and that you were my colleague (you were the squadron second-in-command and I was a private), and give him a clear rendition of your past.

Directive on the Problem of Cultivating Cadres March 1951 The older technical personnel are the legacy of the Kuomintang; they are very highly skilled, but they are, as yet, [politically] unreliable; we should strive to unite them [to our side].
The majority of the university and middle school students throughout the country are children of the landlords and of the bourgeoisie; they too, are the legacy of the Kuomintang.
However, we must cultivate them and transform them.
One section of them is reliable, but there is another section that is un-reliable.
The most important task for us all the present moment is to cultivate the backbone of the technical cadre.
The most important thing is to cultivate the intellectuals who have been in our party, and our armed forces for over a de-cade.
Another sector consists of the intellectuals who are participating in [thework of ] land reform; we can transfer some of them to undergo training.
Another part [of our technical cadre] can be cultivated from among [people who are at the] accelerated middle schools for industrial workers and peasants and from among the children of workers and peasants.
In other words, we would like to get some people from the ranks of these two latter categories and cultivate them, after which they will be used to unite with the two other categories of people mentioned earlier.

Comment on Suppressing and Liquidating Counterrevolutionaries April 2, 1951 The suppression of counterrevolutionaries must be strictly confined to such categories as bandit chiefs, incorrigible criminals, ruffians and petty tyrants, se-cret agents, and chiefs of reactionary secret organizations and sects.
We cannot include petty thieves, drug addicts, common landlords, ordinary Kuomintang members and members of the [Sanmin Zhuyi Youth] League, and common officers in the Kuomintang army.
Death sentences must be for those who have committed serious crimes only.
It is a mistake for a light sentence to be given out for a serious crime; it is equally a mistake for a heavy sentence to be given out for a small crime.

Meitang:157 Cai and he organized and of which Mao also became a prominent member.
In 1919 Li went to France as a participant of the Qingong Jianxue (Diligent Work and Frugal Study) movement.
While in Europe, Li became a very active member of the socialist groups, which included such people as Cai Hesen, Zhou Enlai, Li Lisan, Xu Deli, Chen Yi, and Zhao Shiyan.
Out of these organizations the Chinese Communist Youth League was formed.
In early 1922, Li returned to China and began work with Mao Zedong in Hunan.
In 1927, at the Fifth CPC Congress, Li became a member of the Political Bureau.
He continued to work in Hunan and was active in planning the Nanchang Uprising of August 1927.
He came under criticism by the CPC Congress in 1928, which was held in Moscow, but he held his position in the Party.
From 1928 to 1931, he worked in the communist under-ground in Shanghai.
In 1931, however, he was criticized and removed from the Central Committee for supporting Li Lisan.
Wanted by the KMT police, he escaped to southern Jiangxi and joined Mao Zedong and Zhu De at Ruijin.
Later he went on the Long March to northern Shaanxi.
For the next decade at Yanan he was active primarily in Party organi-zation work, and as far as is known, was not involved in military command or action.
He took on the task of organizing and managing the Party’s United Front Department in 1944 and remained at the head of that department for the next two decades.
He was, together with Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Ye Jianying, one of the chief CPC negotiators with the KMT in the uncertain years of 1946-1949.
After 1949, he became a chief officer of the new government, serving as secretary general of the government Administration Council until 1953, on the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Council, as well as heading the United Front Department.
In this last position, Li was the chief CPC spokesman to the minority nationalities and to the people’s organizations, especially the industrial and commercial circles.

In 1904 he was recruited by Sun Yat-sen to work for the Chinese revolutionary movement and in 1905 he formed the On-Leong Association (Chinese Benevolent Association), a service society set up to assist Chinese-Americans in gaining a settled life and a certain measure of citizen’s rights in the United States.
In 1937 he organized the campaign among Chinese-Americans to raise funds to support China’s struggle against Japan.
In 1941, he returned to China.
En route, he was captured by the Japanese in Hong Kong.
Refusing to collaborate, he disguised him-self and escaped to eastern Guangdong.
In the summer of 1942, he went to Chongqing and returned to the United States in 1943.
In 1945 he reorganized the Zhigongtang into the Hongmen Zhigongdang, a Chinese political party, and became its chairman.
In 1946 he again returned to China, seeking to assist in the establishment of a new democracy.
When this failed in 1948, he left China again, via Hong Kong, and, back in the United States, proclaimed his support for the Communists in China.
In September 1949 he returned, for the last time, to China, and took up the leadership of the Zhigongdang as one of the democratic parties in the new republic.
He became a vice-chairman of the CPPCC and a member of the Central People’s Government.

We must regard this matter as a method by which the Communist Par-ty and the People’s Government can strengthen their ties with the people.
We must not adopt a bureaucratic attitude of callousness and neglect.
If there are a great many letters from the people, and it is difficult for [the cadre in charge] to handle [all of ] them personally, a special organ made up of an appropriate number of people should be set up or special persons assigned to deal with these letters.
If there aren’t too many letters, and either [the cadre in charge] or the secretary is able to handle them personally, then there won’t be any need to bring in additional special personnel.

Tibetan people.
Internally as well, the Tibetan nationality was not united.
This was the result of the reactionary rule by the Manchu government and the Chi-ang Kai-shek government, and also the result of the discord sown among us by the imperialists.
Now, unity has been achieved among the forces led by the Dalai Lama, those led by Panchen Gnoertehni, and the Central People’s Gov-ernment; this was accomplished only after the Chinese people had overthrown imperialism and the domestic reactionary government.
This unity is a fraternal unity and is not based on the oppression of one side by the other.
This type of unity is the product of concentrated efforts on all sides.
From now on, on the basis of this unity, there will be development and progress among our various nationalities in all spheres, including such spheres as politics, economics and culture.

In May 1951 an Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was signed between the Central People’s Government and the local government of Tibet.
The agreement stipulated that the Tibetan local government should resolutely rid itself of imperialist influences and actively help the People’s Liberation Army enter Tibet; that all external affairs in Tibet should be handled by the Central People’s Government—in other words, the Tibetan local government must cut its ties with the imperialists and once more join the big family of the people’s Republic of China.
As to Tibet’s internal affairs, the agreement stipulated that its existing political system and the position and authority of the Dalai Lama would remain unchanged, and the Tibetan people’s religious beliefs would be fully safeguarded.
A positive attitude was adopted towards social reforms in Tibet, but there was to be no compulsion.
Rather, the local government of Tibet was expected to carry out the reforms of its own accord.
In case the people demanded reforms, the matter should be settled by consultation.

On the sub-ject of [going to] inspect land reform, I agree with you177.

It seems to me that it would be better [if you did it] in the spring.

Furthermore, at your venerable age, it is proper for you to go and inspect the land reform, but not for you to engage in land reform [work yourself ].
Besides, in inspecting it, you can go to many places, but if you were to engage in the work itself, you would be limited to a district or a xiang.
Another thing: it is not merely the land reform by itself, but if your energies would allow, such other work as [in the area of ] resisting the US, of suppress-ing counterrevolutionaries, of production, of education, and of the United Front should all be within the scope of your inspection.

It is a united front that includes all the nationalities, all the democratic classes, all the democrat-ic parties, all the people’s organizations, and all the patriotic and democratic personages in the country—a united front of several hundred million people.
It is founded on the workers and peasants; it is under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and it adopts the method of self-crit-icism.
Therefore, it can solidly bind [us] together as one, and it can become more and more vigorous, mightier and mightier.
It is invincible.
Comrades, we have already summed up the experience of the past year and have laid down guidelines for future work.
We have also had a make-up election for eighteen additional committee members.
Let us lead the people of the entire nation in continuing to march forward and in striving to win new and greater triumphs! Source: People’s Daily, November 2, 1951.

Wang Chuanshan (Wang Fuzhi) (1619-1692) was a major thinker of the late-Ming, early Qing period.

This refers to a letter that Dong sent to Rae on the subject of establishing government organs at the xian and xiang levels.
In this letter Dong made several points synopsized as follows: (1) While the work of establishing government organs at the lower levels should be directed by the Party, it would not be appropriate for the Party to be directly involved in day-to-day governmental matters.
Instead, the Party should guide the establishment of such organs through the leadership of government organs at a higher level, and the leader-ship of the Party Committee at all levels of government organs should be realized through the presence of Party members in these organs.
For example, where there are more than three Party members, a Party group should be organized within that organ, so as to ensure the Party’s leadership.
(2) The establishment of government organs at the xian and xiang level is the key.
(3) There must be full organizational and ideological preparation for the endeavor.

tatives’ Conference for Resisting United States [Aggression] and Aiding Korea: Thank you all for your telegram.
During the past year or more, the people of the different nationalities in northwest China have contributed a tremendous effort to the patriotic struggle of resisting United States [aggression] and aiding Korea and have secured great results.
At this conference, you have resolved to further unite the people of the various nationalities, to increase production, to practice strict economy, and to conduct patriotic propaganda and education in order to support the Chinese People’s Volunteers.
This is very good.
One of the reasons that imperialists dared to bully China in the past was that China’s various nationalities were not united.
However, that period in history is gone forever.
From the day of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the various nationalities of China have begun to unite as one big friendly and co-operative family that has sufficient strength to defeat any imperialist aggression and to build our homeland into a prosperous and mighty nation.

Letter to Liu Shaoqi December 15, 1951 Comrade Shaoqi: How is your tour? I imagine that you should have arrived at Hangzhou by now.
According to the reports of Comrades An Ziwen and Hu Qiaomu192, there are still many people who, like the letter written by Yin Yigang of the Hebei Party School, are in disagreement with the idea that the semi-proletariat should also be considered a part of the leading class [in our society].
193 In the process 192.
An Ziwen was at the time of this letter deputy director of the Organization Depart-ment of the Central Committee of the CPC.
193.
According to the source, while the issue of designating the working class as the leading class in society during the period of the New Democratic Revolution and the period of socialist transition is clearly defined, the issue of whether the semi-proletariat should be included in this designation is a subject discussed only in several documents immediately prior to and after the founding of the People’s Republic.
(Note that in this letter Mao used the term ban gongren jieji, i.
e.
, semi-working class.
The term, however, is unclear in its meaning, and because Mao had, in similar contexts, used the term ban wuchan jieji—i.
e.
, semi-proletariat—we have translated the term in this way.
) In February 1948, in revising the article “Stipulations of the Central Committee of the CPC on the Distinction of Social Classes in the Land reform and on Their Various Treatments”, Mao wrote: “The proletariat and the semi-proletariat (the poor peasants) are the leading class in the people’s demo-cratic revolution and the political regime of the new democratic state, with the proletariat being the primary leading class.
” In March-April 1951, at the National Conference on Organizational work, the Central Committee stated in its Resolution on Rectifying and Reorganizing the Basic-Level Organizations of the Party (based on a report by Liu Shaoqi) that “in the past the Chinese revolution was led by the urban working class and the rural semi-working class (ban gongren jieji); from now on it stands in need of greater leadership by the working class.
” Then, in July of the same year, in a statement of Explanation of the Central Committee of the CPC on the Question of the leadership Role of the Working Class and the Semi-working class, this sentence was changed to read “In the past the Chi-nese revolution was led by the working class and the semi-working class in the cities and in the countryside.
” Later, some people, such as Yin Yigang of the Hebei Party School run by the Hebei provincial committee of the CPC, wrote letters of opinion objecting to the idea of considering the semi-working class (or semi-proletariat) as part of the leading class.
Mao then sent these letters to An Ziwen for comment and suggestion on how they can be handled.
An’s suggestion was that the proposal that the semi-working class should be considered as part of the leading class should be amended.
The implication of this letterof Party rectification in many localities, this problem has been proposed, and such a suggestion is reasonable.
Now we are obliged to make some revisions on the proposal in the draft plan for Party rectification.
On this matter we have already been pushed a bit to the passive side, and only by making these revisions can we capture the initiative.
I am now sending for your perusal and assessment a copy of the telegram,194 of An Ziwen’s report195 and of the letter sent to us by Yin Yigang of the Hebei Party School and asking for your opinion on the subject.
Please send somebody back with your response.
Everything here is going well.
Do not be concerned.
I wish you all well.

Somebody has already told me that in the past you were very resolute in the face of [the interrogation by] counterrevolutionaries and did not surrender [to their intim-idations].
This is very good.
For the sake of thrift you should not come to the capital.
It is very good for you to work in Changsha.
If you have any difficulty, you may let me know and I’ll do my best to find you some assistance.
I wish you good health! here is that Mao agreed with An, and sent this letter to Liu Shaoqi for his opinion, Liu responded quickly with his assent, and in December 1951 the Central Committee issued an Amended Directive on the Question of the Leading Classes in the Chinese Revolution, in which it pointed out that “on the question of who leads the Chinese revolution, no matter whether with regard to the past or to the future, we should only say that it is led by the working class (through its vanguard, the Communist Party of China) and should no longer include therein the semi-working class.

Songyun is the honorific name of Cheng Qian (1881-1968) a veteran KMT general, occupying a number of significant military and political posts in that party and in Sun Yat-sen’s government from the late 1910s through the 1940s, and by the late 1940s was one of the most powerful members of the KMT.
(In the 1948, he was a nearly successful candidate for the vice-presidency of the KMT national government).
He was also in that year, governor of Hunan his native province and in whose political affairs he had been active ail his life.
In August 1949 he surrendered to the Communists, who were rapidly advancing on Guangzhou, the seat of the KMT government, then nominally under the presidency of Li Zongren.
His “defection” hastened the collapse of the defense of the KMT forces.
After 1949, Cheng held several important political positions in the PRC.
At the time of this letter he was, among other things, a deputy chairman of the standing committee of the NPC, and, more pertinently here, a vice-chairman of the Central-South Military and Government Administration Committee.

In their great patriotic war of resistance against United States imperialist aggression, the heroic people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have displayed a noble spirit of sacrifice with which they have overcome all difficulties and have secured evident victories.
The peoples of China and Korea are engaged in a common struggle for the sake of resisting our common enemy, United States imperialist aggression, and protecting the security of our two countries and peace in the Far East.
Indeed, as Your Excellency has pointed out, the long-standing friendly relations of mu-tual assistance between the Chinese and Korean peoples have been sealed by 206.

This struggle has already turned the consolidated unity between our peoples into an immense force for the cause of defending peace.
As long as the Chinese and Korean peoples always con-tinue to unite as one and struggle together, we will surely be able to smash the United States imperialists’ plans for aggression against our two countries and to make extremely significant contributions to the defense of peace in the Far East and throughout the world.
I warmly welcome Your Excellency as the ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to the People’s Republic of China and pledge to Your Excellency my utmost assistance in your work of consolidating and promoting the fraternal friendship between our two peoples’.

In 1952 he was working in the PLA Air Force and had been dispatched to Tianjin to gather materials on the “Three Evils” and “Five Evils” campaign.
On his return to Beijing he was invited to see Mao.
The subject of the excerpt from the conversation was the campaign.
208.
The campaign refers to the movements against “Three Evils” and “Five Evils”.
The movement against the “Three Evils” was the struggle against corruption, waste and bureau-cracy launched at the end of 1951 among the personnel of government departments and state enterprises.
The movement against the “Five Evil’s” was the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cheating on government contracts and stealing of eco-nomic information, started at the beginning of 1952 among owners of private industrial and commercial enterprises.

Under your leadership, the people of Poland have built, out of the ruins that remained after the pillage by the Nazi bandits, a country of increasing prosperity, freedom, and happiness.
By their achievements in build-ing a socialist society, the Polish people have provided powerful evidence of the shameful defeat of aggressors and have displayed the invincible, immense strength of the camp for peace and democracy.

Letter to Huang Yanpei June 10, 1952 Mr.
Renzhi:216 Your gracious letter of June 8 has been received.
The year 1840 refers to the year in which Lin Zexu led the people’s masses of Guangzhou in resistance against the attack of the British, that is, the year of the so-called Opium War.
217 It does not refer to Chen Sheng and Wu Guang.
218 I’m afraid your memory 215.
Comrade Mao’s inscription was for the occasion of the establishment of the All China Federation of Physical Culture.
Its inaugural Ceremonies were held in Beijing on June 20.
1952.
The same inscription was also written for the PLA Sports Convention in Commem-oration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the “August 1” Army Day (i.
e.
, the day of the founding of the Red Army).

Faced with the opposition of the Chinese people to her traffic in opium, Britain sent forces in 1840-42 to invade Guangdong and other coastal regions of China, under the pretext of protecting trade.
Led by Lin Zexu the troops in Guangdong fought a war of resistance.
A “Quell the British Corps” which was spontaneously organized by the people of Guangzhou also dealt the British aggressors severe blows.
218.
Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were the leaders of a rebellion at the end of the Qin dynasty circa 209 BC They were both among laborers being transported to Yuyang (in today’s Hebei, near Beijing).
En route, at Dazexian (in today’s Anhui Province), they were delayed by torrential rains.
Fearing that according to the severe Qin laws they would be executed.
Chen and Wu led an uprising that started out with some nine hundred people in the transport and ended up involving several tens of thousands of troops, over a thousand cavalry, and several hundred chariots (a fairly large-scale uprising equivalent to the size and strength of a medium-sized state of pre-Qin days).
Chen was crowned by the insurrection-ary troops and made his “capital” at Chen xian (today’s Huaiyang xian, Henan).
They were eventually defeated by the Qin general Zhang Han.
Chen and Wu’s uprising is known as the first peasant rebellion in China’s history.
has failed you.
China’s modern revolutionary struggle has for its goal, first and foremost, the opposition against the invasion of imperialism.
Therefore it is possible to trace its roots to the Opium War and Lin Zexu and the Guangzhou “Quell the British Corps”219 of its day.
But it would be far too remote to trace it to over two thousand years ago to commemorate Chen Sheng and Wu Guang.
That was a peasant uprising of olden times, and not a modern revolution.

This refers to the popular name given to the Guangdong militia that grew out of the Sanyuanli Incident of late May 1841.
This incident, occurring in the second year of the “Opium War”, was the culmination of severe rising tension between the Cantonese popu-lace and the British troops stationed in and off-harbor in Guangzhou.
On May 29, 1841, a British patrol violated the household of Zhang Zhaoguang in the village of Tonghua, near Sanyuanli.
The local villagers armed themselves and gathered on a hill fronting the British camp.
For the next two days there was prolonged fighting, and on June 1, the British troops were forced to reembark off Guangzhou harbor.

Address to the First Graduating Class of the Military Academy July 10, 1952 President Liu, commanders, members of the Political Work Staff, members of the Rear Services Work Staff, instructors and the graduates of the First Term of the High-Level Accelerated Program Department of the Military Academy, Comrades: The first term of the high-level accelerated program department and the senior level accelerated program department of the Military Academy of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, which itself stands for a great transition in the history of the construction of the armed forces of the Chinese people, has now come to a fruitful conclusion, and we are now holding commencement exercises.
I hereby extend to you my most enthusiastic congratulations.
The establishment of the Military Academy and the educational work that it has undertaken to provide in the last year or so have contributed greatly to the construction of the regularized and modernized national defense troops [ofour country].
This is the result of the combined and unified efforts of President Liu, of all our comrade advisors from the Soviet Union, of all the command-ers, the members of the Political Work Staff, the members of the Rear Services Work Staff, the instructors, and the students.
I wish now to extend to you my gratitude and appreciation.
The Chinese people in its history of building its armed forces, has traveled through a long trek of twenty-five years.
It is, in international circles, with the exception of the Soviet Union, unparalleled in its richness of revolutionary experience.
Nevertheless, prior to the nationwide victory of the Chinese peo-ple, its military construction, owing to the limitations of objective material conditions, was in a relatively low’ stage of development.
By this I mean that we were in a situation in which [our armed forces] had simple and low-quality equipment, in which there was an absence of regular organization and system-atization, in which they lacked strict military discipline, and in which combat leadership was decentralized and non-unified, and often carried within it guer-rilla characteristics, and so on.
These were natural and inevitable conditions in the past, and were therefore correct [for the past].
Nevertheless, since, the Chinese people attained nationwide victory, the objective conditions have un-dergone a fundamental transformation.
We have now entered the higher stage in which we must be in control of modern technology.
This possibility is now fully inherent in the existing objective conditions; as long as we add to it our indefatigable subjective efforts, it is bound to be realized.
In step with the modernization of [our armed forces] equipment, there is a demand that the es-tablishment of the troops become regularized: this means the implementation of a unified command, a unified system, organization, discipline and training [for all the troops], that is, the materialization of closely-knit coordinated ac-tions on the part of all the various arms of the services.
For this purpose, the decentralization, lack of unity and phenomena of lassitude and simplicity in discipline, as well as the guerrilla mentality and practices, which might have been appropriate and correct in the past but are no longer appropriate and correct today, must be overcome, and, in their place, we must strengthen the sense of organization, of planning, of precision and discipline which is to be cultivated in the full range of our work and command, and particularly first of all in terms of education and training.
This is an indispensable condition in the establishment of regularized and modernized national defense troops [for our country].
At the same time, in order that we may organize [and prepare for] suchcomplex, highly mechanized and modern battle or combat, we cannot do without a sound commanding organ that can act as the brains and is rich in scientific organization and division of labor.
The type of commanding organs of the past that were unsound, low in efficiency or even far from being equal to their task must, from now on, be improved and strengthened by much effort.
The kind of situation that in the past placed emphasis exclusively on political work and neglected staff work must be resolutely changed around (it is correct to emphasize political work, and there should still continue to be this emphasis from now on).
In the past some weaker people, people who lacked organiza-tional ability, or even people who had committed some mistakes and did not have a high level of activism, were chosen to work in the commanding organs, and this has caused some commanding officers to be reluctant to serve as staff officers or chiefs of staff.
This situation must be radically turned around.
From now on we must select quality commanders who are rich in organizational and commanding abilities to serve in the commanding organs at all levels, and thus create a new work-style and a new atmosphere in the commanding organs.
This, too, is an indispensable condition in the establishment of regularized and modernized national defense troops [for our country].
Commanders, members of the Political Work Staff and the Rear Services Work Staff, instructors, graduates of the first term of the Military Academy, and students still in pursuit of their studies, comrades: The Military Commis-sion hopes that you will continue to exert your efforts in the glorious cause of the building of regularized and modernized national defense troops, and also that, through your efforts, the spirit of building regularized and modernized national defense troops will be infused into all the units.

Telegram to the USSR September 2, 1952 Generalissimo Stalin: On this seventh anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan, please accept the warm congratulations and sincere gratitude that I, together with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army and all the Chinese peo-ple, extend to you, to the armed forces of the Soviet Union, and to the Soviet people.
During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Soviet Union rendered the Chinese people immense assistance.
The armies of the Soviet Union an-nihilated the Guangdong Army, which was the main force of the Japanese troops.
This helped the Chinese people to claim the final victory in the War of Resistance against Japan.
The fraternal assistance that the Soviet Union has provided for the Chinese people while China has been undergoing the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction has also enabled the Chinese people toconsolidate and increase their strength rapidly.
At this moment, when Japanese militarism is reviving and when the ag-gressive forces of Japan rear their heads once again, the impregnable friendship and alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful guarantee that renewed aggression by Japan or by any other country that is in collusion with Japan in terms of aggressive behavior will be thwarted through our concerted effort, and that peace in the eastern hemisphere and throughout the world will be defended.
Long live the great impregnable friendship between the People’s Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics! (Signed as Chairman of CPG of PRC and dated) Source: People’s Daily, September 3, 1952.
Letter to Huang Yanpei September 5, 1952 Mr.
Renzhi:226 Your letter from Beidaihe,227 your letter of September 4, and the draft of your speech228 have all been received.
Thank you so much.
The intention of the draft of your speech is very good, but I feel that it is a bit too radical, and I am afraid that the majority of the bourgeoisie may not be able to stand it.
Therefore, as according to your bidding, I have suggested certain amendments.
229 I wonder if they are suitable: please consider them and 226.
For reference on the subject discussed in this letter see Instructions to Huang Yanpei, p.
157 of this volume.
Also see Letter to Huang Yanpei, p.
116 of this volume.
227.
Beidaihe, on the eastern coastal tip of Hebei Province, is a popular resort.
For its coastal climate it is often recommended by Mao to others as a suitable place for convales-cence from illnesses or for relaxation and recuperation.
228.
This refers to the draft of the speech that Huang was to make in September 1952 at the general meeting of the Beijing chapter of the China Democratic National Construction Association.
Its title was How Should we Promote, on the Conclusion of the Three Evils and Five Evils Movements, the Spirit of Chairman Mao’s Directive on the Policies of Democratic National Construction? 229.
Mao made the following amendments to Huang’s draft: (1) Where Huang originally had: “The capitalists ought to fully accept working class ideology,” Mao changed it to: “The capitalists ought to fully accept the leadership of the working class and the state-run econ-omy.
” (2) Mao changed the passage reading: “working class ideology to educate and reformmake your own decision.
To ask the bourgeoisie to accept the fundamental ideas of the working class—e.
g.
, the elimination of exploitation, the abolition of classes, the elim-ination of individualism—to accept the Marxist world view, or, as you say: “Without labor there is no living: one must not seek [means of ] living outside of labor or the exertion of one’s own energies,” is to demand of the bourgeoisie that it must accept socialism.
This is possible with a small number of progres-sive elements.
However, it is not appropriate to demand this of them as a class as a whole; at least within the period of the First Five-Year Plan it would not be appropriate to engage in such propaganda.
In the present stage [of the development of socialism], we should only ex-hort them, as a class, to accept the leadership of the working class; i.
e.
, to accept the Common Program.
It is not appropriate for us to exceed this boundary.
In the present stage we allow for the existence of the bourgeoisie, but they must be engaged in enterprises that are beneficial to the state and the people, and must not be involved with the “Five Evils”.
230 This is the leadership of the working class on the bourgeoisie and is stipulated by the Common Program.
It is not possible, or proper, for us to step out of this line and demand that the bourgeoisie accept the working class ideology or, so to speak [for us] to disallow such things as the bourgeoisie’s making money by exploitative means and to allow them to only think, as the workers do, that “without labor there is no living”—[to allow them] to only think [in terms of ] socialism and not capitalists” to “use patriotic ideas and the ideas of the Common Program to educate and reform capitalists” and the passage reading: “help the capitalists to reform their thought” to “help the capitalists to reform those bad ideas, those ideas that do not conform to the ideas of patriotism and the Common Program, i.
e.
, the ‘Five Poisons’ [evils] ideas” (3)To the sentence in the draft that read: “Some members of the bourgeoisie are bad, some are good” Mao added: “For the majority of the bourgeoisie, within the ideology of any individ-ual among them, there are bad aspects, and there are good aspects, we should help them to discard the bad parts and promote the good ones.
” (4) At the end of the draft.
Mao added the following; “This is what we demand and expect of the majority of the bourgeoisie at the present stage.
However, under the current conditions in China, a minority of the bourgeoi-sie, consisting of people who are farsighted, may in fact exceed these expectations and come to accept the basic ideology of the working class, i.
e.
the ideology of socialism.
They may, on the one hand, continue to run and open up factories, without seeking to be immediately reclassified [as workers] or to alter the appearance of their enterprises and, on the other hand, [however], perceive the great contribution that the socialist enterprise is making to humanity, and [thus] hope to become, in the future, socialist.
It is possible that such people exist, and we ought to express to them our welcome.
” 230.
The “Five evils” were—bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cheating on govern-ment contracts and stealing of economic information.

capitalism.
In the earlier half of this year, some comrades writing articles in Xuexi [Study] magazine in Beijing have expressed precisely these opinions; we have already instructed them to make certain revisions and corrections.
With regard to a minority among the bourgeoisie—those people with vi-sion and foresight—I agree with your viewpoint; we can indeed propagandize socialism among them to make them interested in the socialist cause—I think this can be done and is beneficial.
Under China’s [present] conditions, such people may emerge, and, particularly in a few years’ time, when the socialist economic sector grows stronger and larger and has further demonstrated its great contribution to the state and the people, the number of such people may grow gradually.
Of late, your ideas have made much speedy progress.
For example, where you spoke in your letter from Beidaihe on the subject of the state’s sovereignty and this time on the subject of socialism, this is demonstrated.
Nonetheless, what you say is, at the present time, a bit premature.
It is possible for a few peo-ple to think such things, but it is not possible for them to be put into action.
I am expressing my humble opinions above because you seem to place great trust in me.
Whether or not they are proper, I would be very happy if you would examine them and teach me your thoughts.
In the near future, when I have the time, I would like very much to have a talk with you.

Talk With Tibetan Delegates (Excerpts)245 October 8, 1952 The Communist Party has adopted a policy of protecting religions.
Be-lievers and nonbelievers, believers of one religion or another, are all similarly protected, and their faiths are respected.
Today, we have adopted this policy of protecting religions, and in future we will still maintain this policy of protec-tion.
The problem of land redistribution is different from that of religion.
In the regions inhabited by the Han people land has already been redistributed, and in these areas religions are still protected.
Whether or not land should be redis-tributed in regions inhabited by minority nationalities will be decided by the minority nationalities themselves.
At the moment, land redistribution is out of the question in Tibet.
Whether or not there should be redistribution in the future will be decided by you yourselves; moreover, you yourselves should carry out the redistribution.
We will not redistribute the land for you.
The setting up of a military and administrative committee and the reorga-nization of the Tibetan army were stipulated by the Agreement.
246 [However,] because you were afraid, I have informed the comrades working in Tibet to postpone the implementation [of this].
The Agreement must be implemented, but since you are afraid, implementation will simply have to be postponed.
If you are afraid this year, we will wait until next year to implement it.
If you are still afraid next year, the [we] will wait for the year after next before imple-menting it.

This speech was made at a reception that Mao held for the delegation of the people of the Changdu (Chamdo) region of Tibet taking part in the celebration of the anniversary of the founding of the PRC in Beijing.
246.
This refers to the Agreement between the Central People’s Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, May 23, 1951.
Tibet is a large area with a small population.
Its population must be in-creased from the current figure of two or three million to five or six million.
Later it would be good to increase it again to more than ten million.
The economy and culture also need to be developed.
Culture includes such things as schools, newspapers, cinema, etc.
Religion is also included.
The reactionary rulers of the past, [whether] the emperors of the Qing Dynasty or Chiang Kai-shek, all oppressed and exploited you, and so did the imperialists.
They kept your population down, weakened your economy, and obstructed the develop-ment of your culture.
The Communist Party puts into practice [the principle of ] the equality of nationalities: it does not wish to oppress or exploit you, but rather to assist you—to assist you in developing your population, economy, and culture.
When the People’s Liberation Army entered Tibet, it was precisely for the purpose of carrying out the policy of helping you.
In the early period of its presence there, it may not be of much help, and it may not be of great help even for the next three or four years.
Later, however, it will be able to help you, that is certain.
If the Communist Party could not help you develop your population, economy, and culture, the Communist Party would be of no use at all.
.
.
[I] am happy that you have come.
During the next few days you can go to Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, and the Northeast for a visit.
From now on, if more people, both ecclesiastical and lay, and from all different circles of Tibet can come out to visit the various places in the interior, it will help to strengthen the relations of unity and amity among the nationalities in China.

Letter to Song Qingling October 10, 1952 Vice-chairman Song:247 247.
Song Qingling (b.
1892) was one of the most prominent women in China’s modern and recent history Born into a family that acquired very considerable wealth and influence, she married Sun Yat-sen in 1914.
For the next ten years she was also Sun’s confidant in political matters, collaborating with him as a private secretary as well as wife and assistant.
After Sun’s death, Song Qingling’s parting of ways with the rest of her own family came in 1927 when her youngest sister, Meiling, married Chiang Kai-shek.
Earlier in that year, she had parted ways with the mainstream of the KMT, which Sun had founded—i.
e.
, with both the Nanjing government and the Wuhan government—for its anti-Communist poli-cies and purges.
In 1948 she became honorary chairman of an anti-Chiang KMT splinter group, the KMT Revolutionary Committee.

Letter to Tan Zhenlin October 15, 1952 Comrade Zhenlin:248 The [information that] Comrade Chen Yun249 has acquired on conditions in Xiaozheng xiang, Qingpu xian,250 is quite worthy of attention.
I enclose it here for your perusal; please make a copy of it and send to the Party committee of the South Jiangsu district.
According to Comrade Bo Yibo,251 when he was in Shanghai, he already knew that last year’s grain requisition in the Zhejiang and South Jiangsu dis-tricts has been too heavy and that the East China Bureau has resolved to re-turn part [of that] to the peasants.
I wonder what the results have been in this matter? How much, in total, has been returned [to the peasants] in the two districts? How many people’s problems have been resolved [by the action]? What is this year’s harvest like? Has the quantity of the [state] grain requisition been greatly reduced? In order to resolve this problem, I suggest that you convene at the East Chi-after 1949 as one of the “democratic parties”.

na Bureau a special conference of the people responsible for the two districts and the secretaries of the xian [Party] committees of some characteristic xian in the two districts.
Before the meeting is held, you can dispatch two investi-gation teams, one to go to Zhejiang and the other to South Jiangsu; let them go directly to the villages in several xian and investigate [the conditions] in a dozen or so xiang, focusing especially on investigating the real situations with regard to the peasants’ [contributions to] public grain and other burdens—this then can be the basis for discussion at the meeting.
In short, we must earnestly and solidly resolve the problem of giving relief to those peasants who in the past have had little to live on because the [public] burdens have been too heavy.
The grain requisition this year must not exceed the rate stipulated by the Center.
252 [We must] greatly reduce the burden of the people.
I hope that you will notify me your opinions.

Letter to Li Shuqing October 16, 1952 Mr.

As for matters related to the localities, I wish only to collect material and information for reference purposes; I do not want 252.
In February 1950, when the Government Administration Council drew up regulations for the requisition of public grain in the “new liberated areas,” it stipulated that such requi-sition “should not exceed seventeen percent of the gross agricultural income, and the added public grain requisition done by the local people’s government must not exceed fifteen per cent of the official grain requisition.
” In its Directive on the Work of Agricultural Taxation and Requisition in 1952 the GAC stipulated: “In those parts of the late liberated areas where land reform has been completed, a unified system of accumulative progressive tax on the basis of a total combined rate will be followed in 1952.
The accumulative progressive tax rate will start at seven per cent and end at thirty per cent.
As a rule no additional surtax will be allowed.
” In this way the burden of the peasants was somewhat alleviated.

For this reason I will not write separately [on these incidents specifically]: I hope you will for-give and understand.

Conversation During an Inspection Tour of the Flood Prevention Works on the Yellow River (Excerpts)257 October 29-31, 1952 The people of the old base areas contributed a great deal to the revolution-257.
This article was originally published in various newspapers, including Heanan Ribao (March 28, 1957) and Jiefang Ribao (April 6, 1957).
It was also quoted in part in Hong Qi, Mao Zhuxi de Gongzuo, Xuexi He Shenghuo Diandi (Bits and Pieces About Chairman Mao’s Work, Study and Life) in Gongren Ribao (January 15, 1950).

258 When this enormous dam259 is built, the flood hazards of the Yellow River, which have existed for several thousands of years, will be resolved.
Moreover, we will be able to irrigate several tens of millions of mu in the plains and gen-erate a million kilowatts of electricity.
It can also make the river navigable for steamships.
All this can be studied.

(At Dongbatou) Mao: What is this place? Wang (Huayun): Here is where the Yellow River broke through the dikes in the fifth year of the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor of the Qing dynasty260 and changed its course.
It is called Tongwaxiang.
Mao: How many main embankments and stone dikes of this kind have been built? Wang: Along the entire river, we have built 1,800 kilometers of embank-ment and close to 5,000 dikes.
In the past, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the overwhelming majority of these embankments were built of hay stalks and were far from being solid.
Today, they have all been rebuilt with stone.
Mao: For six years the Yellow River has not overflowed its banks and flood-ed.
If from now on we continue to build up embankments and dikes, do you think the Yellow River could still break through? Wang: This is not the way to bring about a fundamental solution to the The author of this article, Wang Huayun, was a worker on the flood Prevention Works on the Yellow River at Lanfeng, Henan.
He accompanied Mao on the trip, made in late October 1952, described in the article.
The points on the Yellow River that Mao visited on this tour—Lanfeng, Dongbatou, Tongwaxiang—are all points on the southern bank of the Yellow River in northern Henan Province, approximately an area 25-50 km east of the city of Kaifeng.
The above represent the more significant exchanges in Mao’s conversation with cadres during this tour.
All statements, except indicated otherwise are Mao’s.
258.
This comment was made in response to Chen Zaidao, who was at the time a member of the People’s Government of Henan Province.
Mao had inquired of Chen how his native village was and Chen explained that although he had not been back to his native village for some twenty-five years, he understood that things were improving since Liberation and since the land reform, even though devastation had been severe during the pre-Liberation period of KMT control.
Chen, born in 1908, was a native of Macheng, Hubei.
He had been the commander of the Fourth Front Army of the PLA in 1932 and fled to Yanan in 1936, after the defeat at Lushan.
He continued to be a military commander of PLA (first in the Eighth Route Army and later in the Second Field Army) from 1937 to 1949.

problem.
If there should be an extraordinarily heavy deluge, the danger would still be quite great.
Mao: And what if the Yellow River overflows to the skies? Wang: If we do not build huge reservoirs, we will not be able to stop [the floodwater] just by these embankments and dikes.
.
.
There is a lot of water in the South and little in the North.
If it were possi-ble, it would be nice to borrow some from the south.
.

(At Liuyuankou) Mao: What is this grass? A comrade: This is called geba grass.
The masses plant this type of grass specially on the dikes in order to protect them.
The masses say that it creates an advantage, that “with geba grass planted on the dikes, we fear neither rain nor waves,” Mao: It is also good stuff to feed the livestock.
Mao: What is this place? Is this water level of the river here higher than [the ground] level in the city of Kaifeng?261 Wu Zhipu:262 This is called Liuyuankou.
Diagonally across the river is Chen-qiao—the location of the Chenqiao military coup, in which Zhao Kuangyun was draped with the yellow’ gown.
263 This place is now a ferry crossing.
Wang: The water level is three or four meters higher than the ground level in the city of Kaifeng, and during floods it is even higher.
Mao: Then this is an elevated river.

Mao: Where does this soil come from? Wang: It is all washed down by the current from the loess plateau in the north-west.

Zhao Kuangyun (928-976) was originally a military commander of troops for the emperor of the late Zhou Dynasty (951-959).
In 960 AD, at Chenqiao, as troops under his command marched against the Khitan forces, Zhao’s lieutenants staged a coup and had the troops proclaim him emperor.
He then accepted the throne from the abdicating Zhou emperor and became, as Emperor Taizu, the first emperor of the Song dynasty.
The draping of the yellow gown symbolizes the conferring of royal status, yellow being a royal color in China.
264.
The Chinese term for loess is huangtu, or “yellow earth”.
The loess plateau encompasses parts of Inner Mongolia, the Ningxia Hui Nationality Autonomous Region (NHNAR), and Gansu, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces.
Wang: According to inspections made by the hydrographic station at Shen xian, an average of 1,280 million metric tons is brought past that point each year.
(The revised figure is now 1,360 million metric tons.
) The sedimentation of such a huge amount of silt accounts for the Yellow River’s flooding and changing course.
Mao: Do the work on the Yellow River well.

Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you as the ambassador extraor-dinary and plenipotentiary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the People’s Republic of China.
In your work of consolidating the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union you will receive my full sup-port and that of the government of the People’s Republic of China.
I sincerely wish you complete success in your work.

Reply to the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of Romania December 29, 1952 Comrade Ambassador: I am very glad to accept the letter of credence from the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the People’s Republic of Romania presented by you, and I am sincerely grateful for your congratulations.
In the past three years, the relationship of friendship and cooperation be-tween the People’s Republic of China and the People’s Republic of Romania, in all areas of politics, economy, and culture, has attained a very great de-velopment.
Such a relationship of friendship and cooperation enhances the prosperity of China and Romania and the friendship of the peoples of the two countries.
Moreover it strengthens the force of the camp for world peace and democracy headed by the great Soviet Union.
Under the leadership of Comrade Gheorghiu-Dej270 the Romanian people are in the midst of victoriously carrying on their socialist construction and have continuously attained brilliant achievements.
These achievements have always won the deep regards and praise of the Chinese people.
Comrade Ambassador, I Warmly welcome you as ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the People’s Republic of Romania to the People’s Re-public of China.
In your work of consolidating the friendship and cooperation 269.

Speech to the Central People’s Government Council January 13, 1953 Throughout the country, military activities on the mainland have already ended, land reform has already been basically accomplished, and people from all walks of life have become organized.
Therefore, the conditions are now ripe for convening, according to the stipulation of the Common Program of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the National People’s Con-gress and people’s congresses at each local level.
This is a great victory achieved by the Chinese people only after decades of struggling for democracy with bloodshed and sacrifice.
The convening of the [National] People’s Congress will further give full play to the people’s democracy and strengthen national construction and the struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.
The government based on a system of people’s congresses will remain a government based on the united front of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all dem-ocratic parties, and all people’s organizations throughout the country.
It will serve the interest of the entire people of the country.

Closing Speech at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC (Excerpts)272 February 7, 1953 First, we must intensify the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Ko-rea.
Because US imperialism persists in holding Chinese and Korean prison-ers-of-war and undermining the cease-fire negotiations and moreover, is vainly attempting to expand its war of aggression against Korea, the struggle to re-sist US [aggression] and aid Korea must continue to be intensified.
We desire peace, but as long as US imperialism does not discard its barbaric and unrea-sonable demands and its plots to expand its aggression, the resolution of the Chinese people can only be to continue to fight together with the Korean peo-ple to the end.
This is not because we like war: we would like to stop the war immediately and wait to resolve the remaining problems in the future, but US imperialism doesn’t want to do things this way.
If that’s the case, that’s all right; we’ll continue to fight.
No matter how many years US imperialism is willing to fight, we are prepared to fight with them for as many years, right up to the time when US imperialism is willing to stop, until the time when the Chinese and Korean peoples are completely victorious.
Second, we should learn from the Soviet Union.
We must carry out the great task of construction in our country.
The work facing us is difficult and our experience is insufficient; therefore we must earnestly study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
Regardless of whether they are in the Commu-nist Party or outside the Communist Party, old cadres or new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, or the masses of the workers and the masses of the peasants, [our people] all must wholeheartedly learn from the Soviet Union.
We should not only learn from the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, but must also learn from the Soviet Union’s advanced science and technology.
We must whip up a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the whole country [in order] to build our country.
Third, [we] must combat bureaucratism in our leadership organs at all levels and among our leading cadres.
At present among a good number of the ba-sic-level organizations and basic-level cadres, serious commandism and breach-272.
This three-point directive was given at the Fourth Session of the First National Com-mittee of the CPPCC, held Feb.
4-7, 1953, in Beijing.
es of law and discipline are occurring.
The occurrence and breeding of such phenomena cannot be separated from the bureaucratism in our leadership or-gans and among our leading cadres.
Take, for instance, the organs at the level of the Center; a good number of leading cadres in a good number of ministries and departments are still satisfied with merely sitting in the government offices writing decisions and issuing directives, paying attention only to arranging and assigning work but not paying attention to going down to the lower levels to get an understanding of conditions and to inspect the work.
They have often let their leadership become isolated from the masses and separated from reality and have caused many serious problems to come up in their work.
If we want to carry out large-scale national construction we must overcome bureaucratism and link ourselves closely to the masses of the people.
Leading cadres at the Center and at all the local levels must all frequently go deep down to the lower levels to inspect the work.
Once the leadership organs and leading cadres have overcome bureaucratism, the bad phenomena of commandism and breaches of law and discipline at the lower levels will definitely be overcome.
Once these defects have been eliminated, our planned national construction will definitely be successful, the system of the people’s democracy will definitely develop, the imperialist plots will definitely be defeated, and we will definitely be able to win total victory.

In the past three years, the relations of close friendship and cooperation between the two great allies, China and the Soviet Union, have attained great consolidation and development.
The truly selfless assistance that the govern-ment and people of the Soviet Union have given New China has not only ac-celerated China’s economic recovery and development but also will have great significance for the realization of the First Five-Year Plan in China’s large-scale national construction.
May the great indestructible friendship between the Soviet Union and Chi-na in opposing new aggressive plots of the imperialists and in the task of safe-guarding peace in the Far East and the world become more consolidated and developed with each passing day.

The Chinese version of this inscription, written after an inspection that Mao made of the Daye Steel Plant in southeastern Hubei, about 40 km, southeast of the industrial city of Wuhan, is merely a representation of the four-character slogan (or policy directive) Ban Da Ban Hao.
It represents a policy of maintaining the quality level of industrial management while at the same time expanding the scope of the enterprises in order to meet the increas-ing demands of socialist construction.
The slogan has been popular since 1952.

(In a report Mao was told that the emphasis was on the technological so-phistication and mobility of the navy, and that the point was made that in a sea battle the role of the people’s masses was minimal.
) The navy too must rely on the people’s masses and on the fishing people.
It cannot become divorced from the masses.
It must go among the fishing people to sink its roots.
Once we have a base among the masses everything is easier to accomplish.
For instance, in the past, when we fought a battle, we knew a lot about the enemy’s situation, but the enemy was unable to fathom our troops’ maneuvers.
This is the effect of the [favorable] conditions provided [us] by the masses [in our struggle].
The army must rely on the masses in fighting a battle, so must you when you fight a battle on the sea.
No matter where you go you must rely on the masses.

In traversing the eleven provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Guang-dong, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xikang, Gansu and Shaanxi, crossing perpetually snow-capped mountains and trackless grasslands, sustaining untold hardships and frustrating the enemy’s repeated encirclement, pursuits, obstructions and interceptions, the Red Army covered 25,000 li [12,500 kilometers] on this march and finally arrived triumphantly at the revolutionary base area in northern Shaanxi in October 1935.

Comrade Shvernik: It was with boundless grief that the Chinese people, the Chinese govern-ment, and I myself learned the news of the passing away of the Chinese people’s closest friend and great teacher, Comrade Stalin.
This is an inestimable loss, not only for the people of the Soviet Union, but for the Chinese people, for the entire camp of peace and democracy, and for peace-loving people throughout the world.
On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and on my own behalf, I extend to you and to the people and government of the Soviet Union our deepest condolences.
The victory of the Chinese people’s revolution is absolutely inseparable from Comrade Stalin’s unceasing care, leadership, and support of over thirty years.
Since the victory of the Chinese people’s revolution, Comrade Stalin and the people and government of the Soviet Union, under his leadership have rendered generous and selfless assistance to the Chinese people’s cause of construction.
Such a great and profound friendship as that which Comrade Stalin had for the Chinese people will be forever remembered with gratitude by the Chinese people.
The immortal beacon of Comrade Stalin will forever illuminate the path on which the Chinese people march forward.
Comrade Chairman, the glorious party of Lenin and Stalin and the great people and government of the Soviet Union will certainly have the brotherly confidence and support of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese peo-ple, and the Chinese government.
With the greatest resolve, the Chinese peo-ple definitely will always and closely unite as one with the great Soviet people to consolidate and strengthen the world camp for peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union, heighten their vigilance, redouble their efforts, strike at the provocateurs of war, and strive to the end for the lasting interests of the Soviet and Chinese peoples and of world peace and security.
I believe that the laboring people and all progressive peace-loving people of the world will takethe same path as we do, following the direction pointed out by Comrade Sta-lin, and take up the sacred cause of protecting world peace.

opinions [on it], please let me know.
Venerable Mr.
Ren[zhi], in your letter you said that you would like to trans-mit what I said in our previous conversation to the industrial and commercial circles.
I think that you can tell a few people those things that I said that were related to principles, such [as the words to the effect that] things should be [handled through] discussion and negotiation, that things should be fair, that people should do just as much business as they have capital for, and that they should be taxed in proportion to the amount of profit they make.
As for the other [things I said], there is no need for them to be transmitted.
[Also], even in the case of the words of principle, you should only talk about them in an informal way, and do not need to transmit them in any formal manner.
This is because these words are indeed too common; they belong to the realm of com-mon knowledge.
It is only because there is a severe problem of bureaucratism in our government work and because many things are not done well that these words appear to be somewhat novel.
As for the concrete methods of resolving [these] problems, they must be seriously and separately studied by the minis-tries of finance, the taxation offices and other offices before [the problems] can be appropriately and adequately resolved.

The Greatest Friendship March 9, 1953 Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the greatest genius of the present age, the great teacher of the world Communist movement, and the comrade-in-arms of the immortal Lenin, has departed from the world.
Comrade Stalin’s contribution to our era through his theoretical activities and practice is incalculable.
Comrade Stalin represented our entire new age.
His activities have led the Soviet people and the working people of all countries to turn around the whole world situation.
That is to say, the cause of justice and of People’s Democracy and socialism has achieved victory in an immense region of the world, a region embracing more than 800 million people—one third of the earth’s population.
Moreover, the influence of this victory is dailyspreading to every corner of the world.
The death of Comrade Stalin has caused the laboring people of the whole world to feel unparalleled and profound grief; it has stirred the hearts of just people throughout the world.
This demonstrates that Comrade Stalin’s cause and his thought have gripped the broad masses of the people throughout the world and have already become an invincible force, a force that will guide those people who have already achieved victory in achieving still more fresh victories, one after another, and, at the same time, will guide all those people who are still groaning under the oppression of the evil old world of capitalism so that they can strike courageously at the enemies of the people.
After the death of Lenin, Comrade Stalin led the Soviet people in building into a magnificent socialist society the first socialist state in the world, which he, together with the great Lenin, created at the time of the October Revolu-tion.
The victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union was not only a victory for the people of the Soviet Union, but also a common victory for the people of the whole world.
First, this victory proved in the most real—life terms the infinite correctness of Marxism-Leninism and concretely educated working people throughout the world on how they should advance toward a good life.
Second, this victory ensured that during the Second World War humanity would have the strength to defeat the Fascist beast.
The achievement of victory in the anti-Fascist war, and the glory for these victories, should be attributed to our great Comrade Stalin.
Comrade Stalin developed Marxist-Leninist theory in a comprehensive and epoch-making way and propelled the development of Marxism to a new stage.
Comrade Stalin creatively developed Lenin’s theory concerning the law of the uneven development of capitalism and the theory that it is possible for socialism to first achieve victory in one country; Comrade Stalin creatively contributed the theory of the general crisis of the capitalist system; he contrib-uted the theory concerning the building of communism in the Soviet Union; he contributed the theory of the fundamental economic laws of present-day capitalism and of socialism; he contributed the theory of revolution in colonies and semi-colonies.
Comrade Stalin also creatively developed Lenin’s theory of party-building.
All these creative theories of Comrade Stalin’s further united the workers throughout the world, further united the oppressed classes and oppressed people throughout the world, thereby enabling the struggle of the world’s working class and all oppressed people for liberation and well-being and the victories in this struggle to reach unprecedented proportions.
All of Comrade Stalin’s writing are immortal documents of Marxism.
His works, The Foundations of Leninism, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union [Bolshevik], and his last great work, Economic Problems of Social-ism in the USSR, constitute an encyclopedia of Marxism-Leninism, a synthesis of the experience of the world Communist movement of the past hundred years.
His speech at the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a precious last testament bequeathed to the Communists of all the countries of the world.
We Chinese Communists, like the Communists of all countries, search for our own road to victory in the great works of Comrade Stalin.
Since the death of Lenin, Comrade Stalin has always been the central figure in the world Communist movement.
We rallied around him, constantly asked his advice, and constantly drew ideological strength from his works.
Comrade Stalin was full of warmth for the oppressed peoples of the East.
“Do not forget the East” — this was Comrade Stalin’s great call after the October Revolution.
Everyone knows that Comrade Stalin warmly loved the Chinese people and regarded the might of the Chinese revolution as incalculable.
On the ques-tion of the Chinese revolution, he contributed his exalted wisdom.
It was by following the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, along with having the support of the great Soviet state and all the revolutionary forces of other countries, that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people achieved their historic victory a few years ago.
Now we have lost our great teacher and most sincere friend—Comrade Stalin.
What a misfortune this is! The sorrow that this misfortune has brought us cannot be described in words.
Our task is to transform sorrow into strength.
In memory of our great teacher Stalin, the great friendship between the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people [on the one hand] and the Communist Party of the So-viet Union and the Soviet people [on the other] formed in the name of Stalin will never cease to be strengthened.
The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people will further intensify the study of Stalin’s teachings and the study of Soviet science and technology in order to build our country.
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a party nurtured personally by Lenin and Stalin; it is the most advanced, the most experienced, and the most theoretically cultivated party in the world.
This party has been our model in the past, is our model at present, and will still be our model in the future.
We fully believe that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of theSoviet Union and the government of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Malenkov will definitely be able to carry on Comrade Stalin’s unfinished work and push the great cause of Communism forward and carry it to greater and more glorious development.
There is not the slightest doubt that the camp of world peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union will become even more united and even more powerful.
In the past thirty years, Comrade Stalin’s teachings and the model of the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union have facilitated a major step forward for the world.
Now that the Soviet Union has become so powerful, the Chinese people’s revolution has achieved such great victories, construction in the various people’s democracies has achieved such great success, the move-ment of the peoples of various countries throughout the world against oppres-sion and aggression has risen to such heights, and our front of friendship and solidarity is so consolidated, we can say with complete certainty that we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression.
Any imperialist aggression will be smashed by us, and all their despicable provocations will be to no avail.
The reason that the great friendship between the peoples of the two coun-tries, China and the Soviet Union, is unbreakable is that our friendship has been built on the great principles of the internationalism of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
The friendship between the peoples of the two countries, China and the Soviet Union, and the peoples of the various people’s democra-cies, as well as with all the people who love peace, democracy, and justice in all the countries of the world is also built upon these great principles of interna-tionalism and consequently is also unbreakable.
Clearly, the strength created by this kind of friendship of ours is inexhaust-ible and truly invincible.
Let all imperialist aggressors and warmongers tremble before our great friendship! Long live the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin! Immortal glory to the heroic name of the great Stalin! Source: People’s Daily, March 9, 1953.
Telegram to Czechoslovakia on Gottwald’s Death March 15, 1953 The Presidium of the Government of the Republic of Czechoslovakia: It was with the most profound grief that I learned the news of the passing away of Comrade Gottwald.
Comrade Gottwald was not only a great leader of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, but also an outstanding fighter in the cause of world peace and democracy.
His death is an irreparable loss to the Czecho-slovakian people and to the entire camp for world peace and democracy.
On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and on my own behalf, I sincerely express to you and through you, to the Czechoslovakian people our deepest sorrow.
I am confident that Comrade Gottwald’s brilliant contributions will forever inspire the Chinese and Czechoslovakian peoples to march forward heroically and triumphantly in the cause of further consolidating and developing the intimate unity and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Czecho-slovakian peoples and further strengthening the camp for world peace and democracy headed by our common ally, the great Soviet Union.

Telegram to Palmiro Togliatti March 25, 1953 Secretary General, The Central Committee, The Communist Party of Italy.
Dear Comrade Togliatti: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and I convey our warmest congratulations to you and to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Italy on the occasion of your sixtieth birthday.
Since your youth, you have devoted your life entirely to the cause of the liberation of the Italian laboring people.
Relying on your heroic struggle and outstanding leadership, the Communist Party of Italy has already become a glorious banner of the Italian working class, a powerful political force in It-aly, and one of the world’s great bulwarks of Marxism-Leninism.
Your bril-liant contributions to Italy’s revolutionary cause, to the international workers’ movement, and to the movement for world peace have won you the respect and love, not only of the Italian people, but also of the people of China and of all countries of the world.
For victory in the cause of Italy’s liberation from oppression by United States imperialism and its running dogs and victory in the cause of world peace and progress headed by the Soviet Union, I wish you good health and long life!

Instruction on Leadership Work of Health Departments of Military Commissions April 3, 1953 The disclosure by Comrade Pai XXX made me think of whether there is any major difference between the leadership work of the government health de-partments and that of the army’s health departments.
I suspect that the leader-ship work of the government health departments is in the same mess as that of the army’s health departments.
We can see neither the political leadership nor any serious professional or technical leadership.
But because of the fact that there is no one else but Pai XXX who makes such a well-grounded disclosure, we still do not know much about this.
.
.
Then the fact exists that there is no leadership, no politics, and no serious administration of the business departments.
The people who run these depart-ments are bureaucrats who just eat without working.
Such a condition exists not only in the health departments of military committees but also in other departments.
I ask you, in the present struggle against bureaucratism, to un-mask these people and set up new organs which really do the work to replace the old ones.

Reply to Ambassador of The Soviet Union April 3, 1953 Comrade Ambassador: I am very happy to receive the letter of credence presented by you from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and am sincerely grateful for your congratulations.
Through their close mutual assistance and cooperation, the people of Chi-na and the great people of the Soviet Union have established an unbreakable friendship.
All the successes attained by New China in the areas of economy and culture and the implementation of its large-scale national construction plan, which is beginning just now, are inseparable from the sincere and frater-nal assistance of the people and government of the Soviet Union.
I deeply believe that with the concerted efforts of the peoples of the two countries, the great friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is bound to continue to develop and be consolidated ceaselessly.
The boundless strength generated by our friendship will definitely play an incom-parably great role in the cause of peace and security throughout the Far East and in the whole world.
Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you as the Ambassador Extraor-dinary and Plenipotentiary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the People’s Republic of China.
In your work of consolidating the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, you will receive my com-plete support and that of the government of the People’s Republic of China.

In the past three years or more, the relationship of friendship and cooper-ation between the People’s Republic of Mongolia and the People’s Republic of China has achieved extremely great development and consolidation.

Address at the Establishment of the Institute of Military Engineering and the Inauguration of its First Term August 26, 1953 President Chen, professors, teaching assistants, students and staff of the Institute of Military Engineering, Comrades: At this moment of the beginning of a new term for you, I extend to you my warmest and most enthusiastic congratulations.
I take this opportunity also to express our heartfelt thanks to the govern-ment of the Soviet Union and the Soviet experts who have so enthusiastically aided us in planning and creating this institute.
The establishment of the Institute of Military Engineering of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has an extremely great significance for our coun-try’s national defense enterprise; in order to build a modernized national de-fense [system], our army, air force, and navy must all possess fully mechanized equipment and armaments, and none of this can be achieved without complex specialized technology.
What we direly need today is a large number of people who are capable of managing and steering the direction of technological [ad-vancement] and to see to it that our technology may improve and make prog-ress uninterruptedly.
The purpose for the creation of the Institute of Military Engineering is precisely to resolve this urgent and yet glorious task.
Learning from the Soviet Union’s experts has been a fine tradition that we have followed throughout the history of the construction of our armed forces.
No matter at what time or in whichever department of our work, we should [continue to] do so.
This is something that has all the greater significance for this Institute of yours.
You must learn from the Soviet Union’s advanced scien-tific and technological knowledge, learn from the Soviet Union’s rich experi-ence in the construction of military science, and emulate the learning mentali-ty and working attitude of our comrades, the Soviet Union’s experts, and their highly developed spirit of patriotism and internationalism.
In learning one must be modest and earnest; one must not become self-satisfied and arrogant as soon as one has learned a little bit.
There is something that you in this Institute, and everybody in the armed forces, must fully understand and never, not even for a single moment, forget,and that is: Maintain and develop the glorious tradition of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, and particularly the heroic spirit of dedicating oneself whole-heartedly to serve the people and of self-sacrifice! I hope that you will unite, and be of one mind, building and running this Institute well, respecting the experts, dedicating yourselves to diligent study, and strive for the accomplishment of the glorious task that the People’s Mili-tary Commission has placed on your shoulders.

M.
Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union: On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of victory in the War of Resis-tance against Japan, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, I extend our warm congratulations to the people and the armed forces of the Soviet Union.
From beginning to end, in the protracted and difficult war to resist Japanese imperialist aggression and in the fighting that finally crushed Japanese impe-rialism, the Chinese people received the support and assistance of the Soviet people.
This was especially true in 1945, when, owing to the fact that the So-viet armed forces joined the war and fought alongside the Chinese people, we defeated Japanese imperialism and achieved the final victory.
Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, with the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union has already been and is still being consolidated and developed with each passing day.
This great friendship has now become a strong guarantee of peace in the Far East and throughout the world.
On top of this we also should point out here that the fraternal assistance that the Soviet Union has given the Chinese people is an important factor in the rapid restoration of China’s economy and in its stepping onto the path to planned construction.
The recent signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is clearly a great, new achievement in the efforts of the entire camp for peace and democracy to win peace and to prevent new war.
This important new achievement has contributed to the beginning of the easing of tension in the world as a whole.
At the same time, it will also contribute to the efforts of the Japanese people in obtaining normalized relations with the various countries of the Far East so as to prevent the revival of Japanese imperialist aggression.
Long live the eternal cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the just cause of defending peace in the Far East and throughout the world!

Telegram to the Chinese People’s Volunteers292 September 12, 1953 The Twenty-fourth session of the Central People’s Government Council heard the report made by XXX, XXX, on the work of the Chinese People’s Vol-unteers in Resisting the US and Aiding Korea.
It expresses its complete satis-faction at the glorious achievements that the Chinese People’s Volunteers have attained in coordinating with the Korean People’s Army in resisting aggression and defending the peace, and at the fact that they have, on this basis, persisted in their striving for negotiations for an armistice for the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem, and its glorious victory in having attained the truce in Korea.
293 The Central People’s Government thanks you for your nonpareil con-tribution in this war for justice and expresses to you its warm and enthusiastic felicitations and greetings.
On October 25, 1950, just when the US aggressive forces invaded the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in full force, and threatened our own northeastern frontiers at the Yalu and Tumen rivers, severely menacing our country’s security, the Chinese People’s Volunteers heroically moved toward Korea to back up the Korean People’s Army in resisting the encroachment of the US imperialists.
In the ensuing two years and nine months, the Chinese People’s Volunteers, acting in accordance with the will of the people of their homeland, stood shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People’s Army and, 292.

with the full support of the Chinese and Korean peoples and the enthusiastic sympathy and support of the various countries in the democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union and that of all peace-loving people around the world, fought unyieldingly, persisted in the efforts to attain negotiations, and finally repelled the enemy’s frenetic aggression, exposing his true brutal and warlike face, inflicting on the enemy severe defeats on the military, political and moral fronts, thus forcing it to accept an armistice.
The achievements of the Chinese People’s Volunteers and the Korean People’s Army in standing and fighting to-gether stand as shining examples of the internationalism and patriotism of the Chinese and Korean peoples, and demonstrate the firm solidarity and invinci-ble strength of our camp for peace and democracy.
They have won the respect and praises of all the progressive people of the world.
The victory represented by the Korean Armistice has totally shattered the maniacal plans of US imperialism for swallowing all of Korea and invading our country’s northeastern region, and protects the peace and security of China, Korea, and the Far East [as a whole].
It has put down and defeated the invader’s fierce flames [of aggression] and has greatly fanned the spirit of courage and faith among the peace-loving people of the world to strive for lasting peace and against aggressive war.
The Chinese people, together with the heroic Korean people and their army, have, with the example of their victory, shown the peo-ple of the world a truth: that the aggressive war conspiracy of the imperialist must and can be defeated, and as long as all peace-loving people unite as one to oppose the intervention [of their own countries] in the domestic affairs of oth-er countries, to oppose wars of aggression, and to insist on resolving matters of international dispute by means of peaceful negotiations, peace is guaranteed.
The victory of the Korean Armistice is a triumph for the movement among the peoples of the world for the peaceful resolution of all international dis-putes.
However, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is but the first step toward the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem.
The peaceful resolution of this problem with the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and under the spirit of having the Korean people handle their own affairs is something that is left to the discussions and settlement of a higher-level po-litical assemblage [in the future.
] The Chinese people have always advocated resolving international disputes by means of peaceful discussion, and they are willing to stand firm as a powerful back-up force for the peaceful resolution of international issues.
In view of the fact that the bellicose elements in the United States and theSyngman Rhee faction in Southern Korea are still in the midst of carrying out all sorts of plots and conspiracies to forestall or sabotage [the convening of ] a political assembly and further undermine the armistice, all our comrades [in] the Chinese People’s Volunteers must double their vigilance and continue to strive to raise their military and political standards.
They must reinforce their own combat strength, further strengthen and develop the friendship between the Chinese people and the Korean people, and hold even more fast to their battle positions together with the Korean People’s Army so as to prevent any acts of aggression or provocation by the enemy.
The Chinese people themselves shall carry out economic construction with all their might, strengthen their national defense forces, and continue to devel-op in a more in-depth manner the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, so as to back up the Chinese People’s Volunteers and the Korean People’s Army.
The government and people of the People’s Republic of China will do all they can to help the heroic Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore a life of peace.
We are convinced that with the encouragement and support of all the peo-ple of the homeland, all our comrades in the Chinese People’s Volunteers will live up to the hopes and expectations of the people of the homeland and con-tinue to strive to ensure the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, for the peaceful resolution of the Korean people, and for the de-fense of peace in the Far East and throughout the world! Long live the memory of the martyrs who gave their lives in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea! Long live the impregnable and eternal friendship between the people of China and Korea! Telegram to the USSR September 15, 1953 Chairman, The Council of Ministers, The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Comrade Malenkov: At a session on September 15, 1953, the Central People’s GovernmentCouncil of the People’s Republic of China heard with satisfaction the report made by Comrade Li Fuchun, representative of the Delegation of the Gov-ernment of the People’s Republic of China, regarding its negotiations with the government of the Soviet Union over the issue of the Soviet government’s aid to China’s economic construction.
The Central People’s Government Council unanimously feels that since the great Soviet government has agreed to sys-tematically lend economic and technical aid to China in the construction and renovation of its ninety-one new enterprises and in the fifty enterprises now under construction and renovation, the Chinese people will, with their efforts to learn from the advanced experience and latest technical achievements of the Soviet Union, be able to gradually build up their own powerful heavy industry.
This plays an extremely significant role in China’s industrialization in its grad-ual transition to socialism, and in the strengthening of the camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union.
In a single negotiation session, the two countries reached a solution on the issue of the construction of ninety-one enterprises and solved the problem of long-term aid.
This is an unprecedented event in history, fully manifesting the truth of the statement made by the great Stalin: “The experience of this cooperation shows that not a single capitalist country could have rendered such genuine and technically refined and advanced assistance to the People’s Democracies as the Soviet Union is rendering them.
The point is not only that this assistance is [rendered at] the cheapest rate possible but is technically first rate.
What is of primary importance is that at the base of this cooperation there lies a sincere desire to help one another and to seek common economic progress.
” In the course of negotiations, the Soviet government, based on the more than thirty years of rich experience in its great socialist construction, has of-fered to us various proposals, either in principle or in concrete terms, with regard to the tasks set out in China’s five-year plan.
These proposals will help us avoid as many mistakes and detours as possible in the course of China’s economic construction.
On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of the Soviet Union for this great, comprehensive, long-term, and unselfish aid.
The Chinese govern-ment and people are willing to devote their unflagging efforts to strengthening the economic cooperation and friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and China so as to facilitate our common struggle for the cause of world peace.

Dear Comrade President: On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of the Chinese people, the government of the People’s Republic of China, and on my own behalf, I extend my most sincere congratulations to the peace-loving people of all Germany and to you person-ally.
The Chinese people have followed with great gladness the achievements attained by the German Democratic Republic in the past four years in all areas of politics, economy, and culture.
The victories which, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the German people have attained in the struggle against provocation by international reactionary forces, and the great results obtained in the negotiations between the government of the Soviet Union and the del-egation of the government of the German Democratic Republic in Moscow, have made a tremendous contribution to the cause of consolidating peace in Europe and throughout the world.
May the German people attain even greater victories in their glorious cause of striving to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.
In this cause, the German people will always have the deep sympa-thy and complete support of the Chinese people and government.

Speech at Reception for Tibetan Delegation301 October 18, 1953 We must unite with all the various nationalities; no matter whether it is a large or small nationality, we must be united with it.
For example, the Ol-unchun people may be no more than four thousand people, but we must be united with them just as well302.
As long as they are Chinese people, regardless of national distinction, we must be united with all those who are opposed to imperialism and who stand for patriotism and advocate unity.
We should be united [first], and [then] carry out our work [in separate ways] in accordance with the varying conditions in the various nationalities’ areas.
In some places [work] can be done a bit more quickly, in other places somewhat more slow-ly.
In either case, things should be discussed first before they are carried out Without discussion, [they] should not be forcibly carried out.
When they have been discussed and approved by the majority, then they can be carried out with deliberation.
Even good things must be discussed first before they can be implemented.
Doing things after discussion is what distinguishes the Commu-nist Party from the Kuomintang.
The Kuomintang oppresses people whenever they hold the upper hand.
Not only do they oppress the minority nationalities; they even oppress the majority of the Han people as well.
The Kuomintang does bad things.
We shouldn’t do bad things; those among our cadres who have committed mistakes ought to be criticized.
Please speak up concerning the shortcomings and mistakes in our work in Tibet; you may speak your mind with regard to anything with which you disagree and which you believe to be detrimental to the interests of the people, so as to help us correct [these mistakes].
[When we] have committed a mistake, we [seek to] correct it imme-diately; this is where we differ from the Kuomintang.
China as a whole is still very backward at the moment, and is in need of be-ing developed.
This is because of the oppression by imperialism and the Kuo-mintang in the past.
They have now been driven away by us, and, in the last 301.
The Tibetan delegation was in Beijing for the National Day celebration of the PRC.
302.
The Olunchun people are a tribal people residing in Inner Mongolia.
By the mid 1960s they actually reached a population of only 2,400-2,500.
four years, we have made great improvements.
After the [period of ] national economic recovery, we have inaugurated, this year, the First Five-Year Plan for National Construction.
We estimate that after three five-year plans, our major industries will have been established.
The Soviet Union chased away imperial-ism and the bad people at home thirty-six years ago, and it took them thirty-six years of construction to achieve what they have now achieved.
We are going to be a bit faster in our construction because we will have the Soviet Union’s assis-tance.
The population in China is very large; we have over five hundred million people and are the most populous country in the world.
We also have a very vast territory.
Given three five-year plans we shall be able to do quite well in our construction, and then we shall be able to give greater assistance to Tibet.
If there is anything that the central [government] can do to assist you, it is bound to do so.
It is in the interests of the entire country for us to aid the various minority nationalities, thus enabling them to develop and improve.
The development and improvement of the various minority nationalities is a hopeful matter.
The political, economic, cultural and religious development of Tibet must be carried out primarily on the shoulders of the leaders and people of Tibet themselves and through the discussions [among themselves]; the Center can only give assistance.
This is an item written into the Agreement on the Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet.
However, it will be some time before [these things] can be carried out, and, moreover, [they] must be carried out on the basis of your volition and gradually.
Whatever can be done will be done; if something cannot be done [as yet], we will wait a bit.
If there is something that can be done, and on which the majority has agreed, it would not be good not to get it done.
[However] it can be done somewhat slow; so that everyone will be happy about it, and, in that way, in reality it may actually be done more quickly.
In any case, our policy is one of being united in our progress and fur-ther development.

Criticism of the Ministry of Public Health309 October 1953 The Ministry of Public Health has been beset with many very serious short-comings during the past few years.

Since the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet state has, like a beacon, illuminated the path of forward progress for the exploited peoples and oppressed nations throughout the world.

The stand taken by the Soviet Union to peacefully resolve all international disputes and its efforts in opposing the imperialists’ policy of aggression prove that the interests of the Soviet Union and those of peace and freedom—loving people throughout the entire world are totally in line with each other.
Good and honest people of all countries are recognizing more and more clearly that the Soviet Union is a strong bulwark for defending world peace and human justice, and moreover, the anti-Soviet slander of the imperialists is only one part of their despicable scheme to enslave humanity.
Through the rich historical experiences of the past thirty-six years, the two peoples of China and the Soviet Union have knit together an unbreakable brotherly friendship.
At present, as the People’s Republic of China, with the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, is progressing along the glorious path of socialist industrialization and the socialist reform of its national econo-my—a path already traveled victoriously by the Soviet Union — people of our country sense more than ever the priceless treasure of the close ties between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the friendship between the two countries.
In the interests of our two people’s common development and in the in-terests of world peace and the progress of humanity, may the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union remain forever consolidated and be con-tinuously developed!

This speech was made on the occasion of the elevation of the diplomatic relations between the GDR and the PRC to ambassadorial level.
In the past four years, the relations of friendship and cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have made tremendous progress.
The transformation of the diplomatic missions be-tween the two countries into embassies will not only further strengthen the close cooperation between the two countries in all areas of politics, economy, and culture, but will also have great significance for the consolidation of the camp for peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the great Soviet Union.
The great successes of the German people in their work of national con-struction and in their struggle to attain peace have already made the German Democratic Republic a strong bulwark of the forces of peace and democracy in the whole of Germany and a principal factor in the defense of peace in Europe and the world.
I believe that, with the assistance of the great Soviet Union and with the sympathy and support of all the people’s democracies and peace-lov-ing people of the world, the German people are bound to attain even great-er victories in their just struggle for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.
The German people will forever have the full support of the Chinese people in this struggle.

Reply to Ambassador of the Soviet Union December 15, 1953 Comrade Ambassador: I am very happy to accept the letter of credence from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which you have presented, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.
The brotherly friendship between the People’s Republic of China and the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has achieved tremendous progress in the past four years and is consolidated with each passing day.
The Chinese peo-ple have always esteemed the friendship of the Soviet Union.
Today, in under-taking the cause of large-scale national economic construction, they recognize even more deeply the invaluable treasure of the Soviet Union’s great friendship.
The Chinese people will certainly, with unwavering effort, always continue to strengthen the intimate friendship, alliance, and overall cooperation between China and the Soviet Union.
I am equally convinced that the unbreakable alliance and cooperation between our two great countries not only completely corresponds to the interests of our peoples, but moreover plays a great, incom-parable role in the cause of consolidating the camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union and of safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and the world.

Comment on the Department of Health Care 1953 It’s a total mess.
There is no visible political leadership; nor can there be seen any earnest professional or technical leadership.
.
.
[It] is a department without leadership, without political [awareness], de-partment that does not even manage its professional [duties] in earnest.
.
.
[It] is a bureaucratic office where people specialize in eating and in acting as an officer and a lord and master.
.
.
This is utterly intolerable… [In] the current struggle against bureaucratism, [we must] tear away [their] masks, completely overthrow these [organs], change their appearance, and es-tablish in their place organs that are truly capable of achieving some work.

In the Past you have done the work of [laying out] strategies; this must be strengthened step by step.

Telegram to the USSR February 11, 1954 Chairman, The Council of Ministers, The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Comrade Malenkov: 319.
The telegram was addressed to the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR.
On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship.
Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, Comrade Chairman, please accept my sincere gratitude and warm congratulations.
The events that we have experienced in the past four years have clearly borne out that the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a dependable foundation for safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and throughout the world.
The sincere and unselfish assistance given to China by the govern-ment and people of the Soviet Union has had vital significance in quickening China’s socialist industrialization, ensuring China’s steady transition to social-ism, and expanding the strength of the camp for peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union.
May the friendship and unity of the two peoples of China and the Soviet Union always develop and be consolidated forever.

I have absolutely no recollection of these things.
For this current year [our commitment] is to send, as a subsidy, 12 million yuan (RMB)323 to the Yang family.
The six million for the first half of the year should be sent out immediately.
Please handle this matter.
Madam Li Shuyi is the widow of Comrade Liu Zhixun of Changsha (a martyr).
324 Her vocation is teaching, but she is advanced in years and the teach-ing is becoming too much of a burden for her, and it would be difficult for her to go on much further.
Someone has asked me to recommend her to a position at the Beijing Literature and History Museum.
The requirements of the Litera-ture and History Museum [in terms of the qualifications of its staff members], however, are rather high.
I have indeed recommended several people, but they have not been accepted and it does not seem appropriate for me to make any more recommendations.
I intend, rather, to aid her with some of the fees I receive for my writing, and thus to resolve this problem.
What I do not know is whether or not she herself, on her part, would accept this type of assistance.
She is a very close friend of Yang Kaihui’s, so there is nothing wrong with my assisting her in some way.
Please write a letter to Mr.
Yang Kaizhi, asking him to relay the question to Madam Li Shuyi, and ask her to express her feelings [on this].

[The term] “people” refers to the bourgeoisie and the democratic parties, and does not include the landlord class or the bureaucrat-ic capitalist class; in other words, it does not “include everyone.
” The phrase “painless labor”327 is best left out in the publication, because, in fact, those people who do not have much [class and political] awareness would feel some pain.
If we write too many checks328 we may cause [people to have] dreams and fantasies, and if we do not then double [our efforts] in educating [them] and studying, if we do not raise their levels of political consciousness, those people who do feel pain would resent us.

Letter to Party Branch and Xiang Government of Shicheng Xiang April 29, 1954 Comrades of the Shicheng xiang Branch [of the CPC] and of the xiang Government of Shicheng xiang: Mao Yueqiu333 came to Beijing with your report.
I am very grateful.
Some of my relatives of the Wen family of Tangjiaduo have come to Beijing to see me in the past several years.
334 Some of them, on returning home, have become arrogant and would not accept the supervision of the government; this is wrong of them.
The people of the Wen family, no matter who, ought to be like everyone else in the village; they should obey the leadership of the Party and the government, work diligently in their farming, and observe the law; there should be nothing special about them.
I ask you not to feel that because those of the Wen family are my relatives, therefore it may not be easy to control them as you wish.
My attitude [toward this matter] is: First, since they are [members of ] the laboring people, and are my relatives, I care about them; second, because I care about them, I hope that they will make progress, that they will work diligently in their farming and observe the law, that they will take part in the mutual aid and cooperative organizations.
In all this they ought to be exactly like everyone else and may not behave at all specially.
If they behave in any backward manner, they ought to be criticized.
They should not be spared the criticism of their failings and errors simply because they are my relatives.
Here I have a letter from Comrade Wen Bingzhang,335 which I enclose for your perusal.
I am in agreement with Comrade Wen Bingzhang’s opinion; please handle it.
Please also show this letter of mine and that of Wen Bing-zhang to the people of Tangjiaduo so as to help them correct their failings and mistakes.
I believe that as long as both you and I take the correct attitude and as long as they are not stubborn in their opinion, their shortcomings and mis-takes can be rectified and they can make progress.

Directive on Work in Traditional Chinese Medicine July 30, 1954 [Traditional] Chinese medicine has made a great contribution to the people of our country.
With a population of six hundred million, China is the most populous country in the world.
Of course, there are many factors contributing to the ability of our country’s people to multiply and prosper day by day, but of these, the part played by health care must be one of the [most] important.
In this respect, we must give credit first to [traditional] Chinese medicine.
If we compare Chinese and Western medicine, [traditional] Chinese med-icine has a history of several thousand years, whereas Western medicine was introduced into China only a few decades ago.
To this day, there are still more than 500 million people in the entire country who rely on [traditional] Chi-nese medicine for the diagnosis and treatment of their illnesses, while those 338.
The Geneva Conference was convened from April 26 to July 21, 1954, to settle the issues of the national independence and the peace settlement of Korea and Indochina.
On July 21, agreements regarding the independence of the three countries, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were reached.
who depend on Western medicine number only several tens of millions (and most are in big cities).
Therefore, if we speak of China’s health care since the beginning of history, the contributions and accomplishments of [traditional] Chinese medicine are very great.
For a number of years, not only has our homeland’s medical heritage not been developed, but on the contrary, it has been slighted and repudiated.
(For instance, examinations given to practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine cover the subjects of physiology and pathology.
Those who fail these subjects are not given certificates.
In addition, there are regulations such as those pro-hibiting practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine from joining hospital staffs).
The Central Committee’s directive on uniting doctors of the traditional Chinese school with doctors of the Western school has not been fully carried out, and a true unity between the two sides remains unresolved.
This is a mis-take.
This problem must be resolved; this mistake must be corrected.
It requires first of all that the health care administration departments at all levels should change their way of thinking.
Henceforth, the most important thing is to first ask practitioners of West-ern medicine to study [traditional] Chinese medicine and not for practitioners of [traditional] Chinese medicine to study western medicine.
First, we must transfer a hundred to two hundred graduates of medical institutes or colleges, handing them over to some well-known doctors of [traditional] medicine so that they can study their clinical experience.
Furthermore, they should assume an attitude of great modesty in their studies.
It is a glorious [endeavor] for practitioners of Western medicine to study [traditional] Chinese medicine be-cause after studying and promoting if they will be able to remove the boundary between [traditional] Chinese medicine and Western medicine and from a uni-fied Chinese medical science as a contribution to the World.
Second, all hos-pitals must systematically invite doctors of [traditional] Chinese medicine to come to the hospitals to give medical treatments to patients and hold consulta-tions, and permit hospitalized patients to take [traditional] Chinese medicines.
Furthermore, all sorts of regulations should be laid down to ensure systemati-cally that respect be shown to doctors of traditional Chinese medicine so that they may not encounter difficulties or have a feeling of apprehension when they do their work of treatment in the hospitals.
Third, Chinese medicine [it-self ] should be well-protected and developed.
Our country’s Chinese medicine has a history of several thousand years, and it is an extremely precious asset of our homeland.
If we simply let it decline, it would be a crime on our part.
Therefore, we should investigate and protect the growing of medicinal herbs in the various provinces, encourage their production, facilitate their shipment, and improve their marketing.
For instance, some medicinal herbs, because of their relatively long growth period, require from planting and cultivating to harvesting, a period of more than two or three years.
For instance the white peony [Peionia albiflora] is a plant that matures in four years, and the huanglian [Coptis japonica] is one that matures in six years.
Individual peasants often do not have the resources to plant them.
Furthermore, in some herb-producing areas such as Gansu and Qinghai, the herbs produced cannot be shipped out in time because of the inconvenience in transportation and the peasants often use them as fuel.
In the past, there was a great wastage of some Chinese herbs because the processing and preserving techniques were deficient.
Packaging and storage methods were not good and losses from mildew and spoilage were severe.
[The situation] should be improved.
Institutions in charge of such work should hence forth adopt a joint state-private form of management.
Personnel who process medicinal herbs should be classified according to their technical levels and be considered technical cadres.
As for research in Chinese [herbal] medicine, it is not sufficient merely to conduct chemical analysis.
We should go one step further and carry out pharmacological and clinical experiments.
In particular we should pay special attention to the compound effects of the Chinese [herb] medicines.
Fourth, we should begin to sort things out and pull together writings on [traditional] Chinese medicine.
In the past nobody pulled together [such texts] because they were difficult to comprehend and were not valued.
Medicinal books on [traditional] Chinese medicine will soon cease to exist if we do not collect them together.
We should organize learned physicians of traditional Chinese medicine to, first of all, systematically but also selective-ly translate those useful [texts on traditional Chinese medicine] from ancient Chinese into modern Chinese.
When the time is right we should further orga-nize [these physicians] to summarize their own experiences and compile a set of systematic texts on [traditional] Chinese medicine.
To realize the various tasks mentioned above, we must first rectify bour-geois, individualistic and sectarian ideology.
Only when there is a change in ideology can the tasks mentioned above be carried out thoroughly.
From now on, [personnel] at any level of administrative departments in public health will be dismissed if they do not do well in carrying out these tasks.

Telegram to the USSR September 2, 1954 Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Comrade Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet So-cialist Republics: On the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the victory over Japanese mili-tarism, we express warm congratulations and deep gratitude to the Soviet gov-ernment, the Soviet armed forces, and the great Soviet people.
The agreement reached at the recent Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina has further eased international tension.
This is an important vic-tory for the forces of peace and a serious defeat for the forces of war.
However, the United States’ aggressive clique refuses to take their defeat lying down and are in the midst of actively reviving Japanese militarism, engineering the or-ganization of war blocs in the Western Pacific and Asia, and intensifying the instigation and abetting of Chiang Kai-shek’s traitorous clique in continuing its war of harassment and sabotage against the Chinese mainland and offshoreislands so as to extend the threat of war throughout the Far East and the world.
The Chinese people are firmly opposed to this war policy of the United States’ aggressive clique and will definitely liberate Taiwan in order to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to defend the peace and security of the Far East and the World.
Restoring normal relations between the various countries of the Far East and Japan and preventing the revival of Japanese militarism have become the urgent task of all the peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia.
The Chinese people are prepared to strive for the fulfillment of this task.
The friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a strong guar-antee for the consolidation of peace and security in the Far East and through-out the world.
Long live the great, unbreakable and ever-growing friendship between Chi-na and the Soviet Union! (Co-signed as Chairman of CPG of PRC with Zhou Enlai as Pre-mier of GAC and Foreign Minister, dated in Beijing) Source: People’s Daily, September 3, 1954.

Over the past ten years, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, and following the teachings of Comrade Dimitrov, have consolidated the peoples’ democratic system and attained glorious achieve-ments in the socialist construction of their country.
This has not only inspired the Chinese people who are in the midst of their socialist construction, but also has strengthened the forces for world peace and democracy headed by theSoviet Union.

The Albanian people are an industrious and courageous people and have a glorious revolutionary historical tradition.
In the ten years since their libera-tion, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor, have smashed all the schemes of both domestic and foreign enemies to carry out sabotage, are confidently building happy lives for themselves, and have achieved brilliant successes.
The patriotic spirit and incomparable enthusiasm for labor demonstrated by the Albanian people in the struggle for socialist con-struction and for the defense of their homeland’s independence and security are objects of great admiration for the Chinese people.
For the first time in history, the two peoples of China and Albania have established friendly diplomatic relations.
In the last five years, our people have already knit together a brotherly friendship.
I deeply believe that after the ex-change of ambassadors, the sincere, friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries is bound to achieve yet further development.
This not only will contribute to the enhancement of the happiness of our two peoples, but moreover will help strengthen the forces for world peace and democracy head-ed by the Soviet Union.

Telegram to the German Democratic Republic October 5, 1954 Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic Dear and Respected Comrade President: On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of the People’s Republic of China, the Chi-nese people, and on my own behalf, I express sincere and warm congratula-tions to the German Democratic Republic, to the peace-loving people of all Germany, and to yourself.
The people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party and yourself, and with the sincere aid of the great Soviet Union, have already attained glorious successes in consolidating the people’s democratic political power, as well as in developing the national economy and raising the people’s living standards.
Over the last five years the German Democratic Republic has united all the progressive patriotic forces among the German people in carrying forward an unrelenting struggle, striv-ing for a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany, and for establishing collective security in Europe and safeguarding world peace.
Thus it has won the enthusiastic support of the peace-loving peoples of Europe and throughout the world.
These successes and efforts by the German Democratic Republic have inspired all the peace-loving German people and have strength-ened then confidence in fighting for the peaceful unification of Germany.
The brotherly friendship and the close economic and cultural cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are growing with each passing day.
The German people have the profound sympathy of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people in thejust cause that they have undertaken in order to strive to establish a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany.
The communique of July 25, 1954 on the discussion between our country’s premier and the premier of the German Democratic Republic shows our two people’s mutual concern and support in the great cause of peace.

Letter to the USSR October 12, 1954 Dear Comrade Khrushchev and the Delegation of the Government of the Soviet Union: On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the delegation of the government of the Soviet Union, rep-resenting the Soviet People, has given the Chinese people a gift of the machin-ery and equipment necessary for the organization of a grain-producing state farm with a sown acreage of twenty thousand hectares.
During the period of organizing this grain-producing state farm and in the first year of learning to master production on the farm, the government of the Soviet Union, in order to render China both organizational and technical assistance in establishing and managing this grain-producing state farm, is prepared to send a group of experts to the People’s Republic of China as advisers so that the Chinese per-sonnel in charge of this grain-producing state farm can, working together with the Soviet experts, master the technology and method of managing this large-scale grain-producing farm in the shortest [possible] time.
On behalf of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people, I sincerely express warm welcome and sincere gratitude to the government and people of the Soviet Union for this important, tremendous, friendly assistance.
This state grain-producing farm will, beyond a doubt, not only play an important role as a model for the promotion of the socialist transformation of agriculture in China, but moreover will also aid China in training technical personnel in agricultural production and learning the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in the opening of virgin soil and reclamation of idle land.
With this generous aid from the people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese peo-ple have once again seen the Soviet People’s deep friendship toward the Chi-nese people and their concern and support for the Chinese people in their cause of construction.

Telegram to the USSR344 October 16, 1954 Dear Comrades! Permit us on behalf of the entire Chinese people to express heartfelt grat-itude to you for your friendly congratulations on the fifth anniversary of the Chinese People’s Republic.
The successes of our country’s peoples during the last five years in social reforms, restoration of the national economy, socialist construction, and so-cialist reconstruction are inseparable from the sincere and unselfish aid of the great Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government.
We ask you to convey our most sincere gratitude to all the Soviet people.
Long live the indestructible brotherly friendship of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union! Implement the Correct Policy in Dealing with Doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine October 20, 1954 The medical lore of our country has a history of several thousand years.
It is rich in content and contains valuable clinical experience, and it has played an immense role in the people’s struggle against disease through the ages.
To inherit and to develop this cultural heritage, to study it earnestly and to research its theories and its practical experience, in order to organize and 344.
The message was addressed to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU and was issued in the name of Mao himself as Head of State of the PRC, and in the name of the Standing committee of the NPC, the State Council of the PRC, and the Central Committee of the CPC.

summarize it with scientific methods, and thus gradually to raise its scholarly and clinical standards so as to make it become of even more effective service to the people — this is an immensely glorious and arduous task facing the medical profession in our country.
If this work is done well, it will not only greatly facilitate the development and enhancement of our people’s health care and medical enterprise, but will also further enrich the contents of the medical science of the world.
The Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Government have always held our homeland’s cultural legacy in esteem; the policy adopted by the Party and the People’s Government with regard to doctors of traditional Chinese medicine has always been clear.
The Party has consistently appealed to doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine to unite and cooperate, to help and en-courage each other for the general purpose of raising the standards of modern medical science and clinical capabilities and to even better serve the interests of the people and make a joint effort to study and research the medical heritage of the homeland so as to develop it unceasingly and to make it play an even greater role.
Over the last several years, however, the leadership in the depart-ments of the administration of health care has consistently failed to carry out this policy adopted by the Party and the People’s Government seriously and has not concretely implemented the accurate principle of uniting doctors of Chinese and Western medicine.
Obviously in the mobilization and organi-zation of doctors of traditional Chinese medicine to take part in the hygiene and vaccination programs and in organizing clinics of Chinese doctors or joint clinics of doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, it has done some work and has had some achievements.
Nevertheless, such work has not fundamen-tally resolved the problem of giving play to traditional Chinese medicine and certainly has not represented the adoption of an effective method in mobilizing and organizing doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine to jointly re-search and develop the homeland’s medical heritage and to enrich the contents of modern medical science.
Furthermore, the leadership in the departments of health care administration has often even violated the Party’s and the People’s Government’s policy and adopted an attitude of disdain, discrimination, and exclusion toward doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, using all sorts of restrictive methods in dealing with them.
This has been an attack on the posi-tive attitude of the doctors of Chinese medicine in their work, has abetted the cadres in health care work and doctors of Western medicine in their erroneous mentality of despising Chinese medicine and Chinese pharmacology itself, andhas adversely affected the development and improvement of the profession of traditional Chinese medicine severely.
Other related work departments and public opinion in society have also shown insufficient regard or concern for Chinese medicine.
These mistakes must be rectified.
The reason that the leadership cadres in health care administration are un-able to implement the Party and People’s Government’s policy toward Chinese doctors is that they have been afflicted by the remnant poison of bourgeois ideology and consequently look down upon the medical legacy of the home-land.
They do not realize the importance of inheriting and developing the homeland’s cultural heritage to the construction of a new culture; they do not realize the importance of enhancing the medical legacy of the homeland to the raising of the standards of modern medical science and clinical ability and to the development of the people’s cause of health care and medical treatment.
Consequently they are also unaware of the importance of uniting with doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, enhancing it, and thus allowing it to take its full effect.
They neglect the practical needs of the broad masses of the people for Chinese medicine and Chinese pharmacology; they ignore the traditional Chinese doctor’s rich experience and obvious clinical effectiveness; they do not study or investigate in earnest; they do not carefully analyze and sum up the situation but they jump ahead and make the generalization that Chinese med-icine is “backward” and “unscientific” and negate it wholesale.
Such an attitude of not recognizing facts and not emphasizing practical experience is an attitude of extremely “unscientific” arbitrariness.
This erroneous attitude adopted by the leadership cadres in health care administration toward Chinese medicine and Chinese pharmacology concretely manifests gravely sectarian mentalities and sentiments.
Such mentalities and sentiments of looking down upon Chi-nese medicine and Chinese pharmacology have not, over a long period of time, been fundamentally turned around.
This has caused the situation in which there has been no apparent change in the serious and persistent backwardness in the work in traditional Chinese medicine.
Therefore if we are to make a serious effort to improve the work in Chinese medicine, we must first resolutely correct the serious mistake that exists within the leadership of the departments of health care administration and other re-lated areas in that they look down upon the homeland’s medical heritage and neglect the role played by Chinese medicine and Chinese pharmacology in our people’s health care, and we must actively call upon and organize doctors of Western medicine to study and research Chinese medical science.
This is theimmediate key to the resolution of our problem.
There can be no doubt that it is necessary to appeal to and organize doctors of western medicine to study and research Chinese medical science.
This is because the enormous and arduous task of developing the homeland’s legacy of medical science can be accomplished gradually only through the long-range cooperation between doctors of Chinese and Western medicine.
The irrefut-able clinical effectiveness of Chinese doctors and Chinese medicine has proved that Chinese medical knowledge has a rational and useful content.
Its major weakness is that it has lacked a systematic scientific theory and has not yet tak-en hold of a reliable methodology of chemical experimentation and scientific inspection.
This has greatly limited the scope of its development and enhance-ment.
Therefore, the basic problem of developing the homeland’s medical her-itage is a problem of gradually integrating it with modern scientific theory through serious study, research and practice.
This means that we must, based on the theories of modern science, organize the principles of traditional Chi-nese medical science and summarize its clinical experience by scientific meth-ods and absorb from it the essentials and eliminate the dross so as to gradually channel it into modern medical science and turn it into an important compo-nent of modern medical science.
Thus we should gradually establish a modern school of medicine of this nature.
It should reflect the special characteristics of China’s geography and climate, reflect the special characteristics of the appli-cation of pharmaceutical material produced specially in China, and reflect the particular features of the life and labor of the various peoples of China.
This is the long-range and grand goal of our development of the medical legacy of the homeland.
In order to attain this goal, doctors of traditional Chinese medicine will naturally have to make an arduous and sustained effort over a long period of time, but doctors of Western medicine who are endowed with relatively rich scientific knowledge, also have their especially glorious assignment in this as well.
In the current situation in which the medical heritage of the homeland is not regarded with esteem or comprehended in general by doctors of West-ern medicine, the emphasis on the importance of having doctors of Western medicine study and research Chinese medical science has a particularly great practical significance.
It is only through their own study and research of the medical heritage of the homeland that doctors of Western medicine can pro-mote the role played by modern medical scientific knowledge in organizing and enhancing that heritage.
To identify the promotion of the medical heritage of the homeland with thedevelopment of modern science makes perfect sense.
To constantly discover, by the combined effort of Chinese and Western medicine, scientific truths from this invaluable cultural legacy will surely bring about daily enrichment of the treasury of modern medical science.
In the last few years some doctors of Western medicine have achieved some success in their study and research of Chinese medicine.
This is illustrated for example by the accomplishments in the study of Chinese acupuncture treatment on the basis of the scientific theo-ries of neuropathology.
In general, doctors of Western medicine are willing to apply methods of treatments and prevention that have a scientific foundation both in theory and in practice; this is correct as far as it goes.
However, they have cast aside the several thousand years of practical experience of Chinese medicine and do not excavate new knowledge new medicines or new methods from the experience of Chinese medical science, and this is very wrong.
In this way, curtain limits have been placed on the development of modern medical science itself.
For example, if we were to delve into the method of acupuncture treatment, possibly we could write a new page in the history of modern medi-cal principles: we might therefore be obliged to revise existing theory about the mechanical mobility and neuro-adaptation of healthy and sick people alike.
As long as we launch the work of studying Chinese medicine and Chinese phar-macology in a well-planned, well organized fashion and with good leadership, we are bound to make a major contribution to modern medical science and to the cause of the people’s health care.
To the individual doctor of Western med-icine, to study and research Chinese medicine by scientific methods not only does not pose any danger to the medical knowledge or clinical technique that he or she possessed to begin with, but indeed it can bring about enrichment and enhancement of this knowledge and technique.
In emphasizing the importance of having doctors of Western medicine study and research Chinese medical science, we have not removed in the slight-est from the broad ranks of doctors of Chinese medicine the great task of promoting the medical heritage of the homeland.
In the past, some doctors of Chinese medicine have carried out organization and research in the art and science of Chinese medicine by applying relatively modern viewpoints and methods and their accomplishments have been considerable.
The majority of doctors of traditional Chinese medicine however, neglect research work.
This situation should be reversed now.
In order to strengthen their own research work in cooperation with doctors of Western medicine, doctors of Chinese medicine will not only have to constantly dig into the principles of Chinesemedicine and have a good grasp of their clinical experience, but they must also learn the necessary fundamental scientific knowledge so as to play a greater role in organizing and summarizing the principles and experience of Chinese medicine.
In order to unite doctors of Chinese and Western medicine in a combined effort to promote effectively the medical heritage of the homeland, the lead-ership organs in health care ought to base themselves on the spirit of premier Zhou Enlai’s Report on the Work of the Government345 and penetratingly exam-ine the conditions of the past within their own departments regarding the issue of carrying out the policy adopted by the Party and the People’s Government toward Chinese medicine and earnestly correct the erroneous attitudes toward Chinese medicine and Chinese pharmacology.
At the same time they must meticulously carry out ideological work and policy education among doctors of Western medicine, remove their ideological obstacles, and on the ideologi-cal basis of their own awareness and voluntarism, stir up their enthusiasm for studying and researching the medical legacy of the homeland.
Furthermore, they must adopt, in a well-planned and methodical way, a series of organi-zational measures and utilize necessary systems and structures to ensure an improvement in the work of Chinese medicine.
Naturally, to do this work well is very complicated.
The methods of treat-ment are different for doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, and to make them support and complement each other, to direct them toward one goal, one result, when they begin with different paths, we must have a powerful ideological and organizational leadership, one that will guarantee that they will constantly maintain a high level of initiative and activism and will struggle for a common goal.
The principle of the integration of theory and practice must be carried out; in all things we must proceed on the premise of practice and conduct research work for the purpose of resolving practical problems.
The special characteristics of doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine, and particularly those of doctors of Chinese medicine, must be given attention.
The preliminary experience of certain clinical units in carrying out consulta-tions between doctors of Chinese and Western medicine must be summed up, and new experiences must be carefully planned and assigned clear priorities to serve as a basis for directing work in general.
We must make realistically solid and reasonable arrangements for the cooperation between doctors of Chinese 345.
This is a reference to the Report of the Work of the Government delivered by Zhou Enlai, at the First Session of the First National People’s Congress.
medicine and doctors of Western medicine on the basis of their practical cir-cumstances in all areas in each locality, so that they will not have to worry, and, cooperating in a friendly and intimate atmosphere, each can fully develop his or her own special skill.
Only this type of cooperation will succeed in constant-ly reinforcing the unity of doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, and only then can they effectively carry out the enormous task of promoting the medical heritage of the homeland.
The work of Chinese medicine covers a very broad area.
Not only does it call for the positive and active effort of the departments of health care admin-istration; it also requires the close coordination of all other related departments and the resolute support of public opinion in society.
In particular, it requires the unified leadership of the Party; this is the greatest guarantee of the suc-cessful implementation of this task.
Party committees in every locality must shoulder their responsibilities seriously, constantly instruct and urge all related areas to implement the Party’s policy toward Chinese medicine, and actively make improvements in this major area of work that concerns the life and death as well as the general health of the people.

It is not that they are not on the alert.
In fact they are very alert.
Their tendency is very obvious.
They defend bourgeois thought, they like things that oppose Marxism, and they view Marxism with hostility.

All this serves to convince us that as long as the people of all countries take up the cause of defending peace and uphold it to the end, world peace can then be preserved and consolidated.
The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union increasingly re-veals its extraordinarily great role in promoting the common prosperity of the two countries and defending peace in the Far East and throughout the world.
The recent discussions between the delegation of the government of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev and the Chinese government signifies a new development in the great friendship between the two countries and have again demonstrated the unanimous aspirations and common interests of the eight hundred million Chinese and Soviet people.
This friendship will acceler-ate the socialist construction undertaken by the Chinese people and enhance the further consolidation of peace in the Far East and throughout the world.

I have asked Vice-premier Chen Yun356 to pay attention to the lingering cases of the “Five-evils”.
I am very concerned about how you are, with your illness.
I hope you will pay attention to nursing yourself back to recovery.

The Chinese people are joyous at and inspired by the brilliant successes of the Mongolian people.
May the Mongolian people attain still greater victories in their cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

There seems to be some wrong words; for instance, [when you said] “the pragmatists maintain that it is matter that comes first and consciousness that comes second.

I believe that China makes great contributions to the world, and one of these is Chinese medicine.
Chinese medicine was born on the basis of hand-icraft and agricultural production.
Theories regarding gold, wood, water, fire and soil may be criticized,362 but precious experiences must be protected and promoted.
Those who make criticism must understand this.
What is science? Correct and systematic knowledge is called science.
Isn’t Western medicine a science? It is also somewhat idealistic.
Mechanical materialism, for instance, must be transformed.
China should have one medical service, and not two medical services, as they have existed for a long time.
The term doctor of West-ern medicine is improper; as materialist dialectics would have it, there should 361.

Mao is referring here to the ancient Chinese cosmological theory that the universe is made up of these five fundamental elements or forms of matter (wuxing).
In the tradi-tional sense of the words, jin, here translated as “gold” is more appropriately translated as “metal”, and tu as “earth” rather than “soil”.
The earliest written formulation of this theory appears in the ancient book Hongfan (Framework of the Cosmos) in Shangshu (Book of History).
be one unified term for doctors.
It is wrong for some to over-exaggerate the importance of Chinese medicine.
Traditional Chinese hospitals should be run experimentally at key points.
In regard to the question of further training of traditional doctors, it is right and proper to require them to study fundamental subjects and to exchange experiences.
It may be difficult, I am afraid, for them to learn the pharmacology of Chinese medicine.
2.
From now on, graduates from medical programs in the universities must study traditional Chinese medicine for two years.
3.
China ought to have one [integrated school of ] medicine, and not two [schools of ] medicine [coexisting] over a long period of time.
The terms Chi-nese medicine and Western medicine are inappropriate; there ought to be only one integrated school of medicine based on dialectical materialism.
The health of the six hundred million people in China primarily relies on Chinese medi-cine, and not on Western medicine.
4.
To look down on traditional Chinese medicine is a slavish bourgeois mentality.

Reply to Ambassador of the Republic of Finland January 28, 1955 Mr.
Ambassador: It is with great pleasure that I accept the letter of credence from the Pres-ident of the Republic of Finland which you have presented to us, and I am grateful for his friendly wishes which you have just conveyed.
In the last four years, the economic ties and cultural exchange between China and Finland have, on the foundations of equality and mutual benefit, greatly developed.
Il is commonly known that the friendly exchange between our two governments and our two peoples have, over the last few years, taken place in many diverse forms.
Particularly satisfying has been the situation of smooth development in the trade relations and cultural lies between our two nations.
There has been progress in our trade relations every year, and our trade agreements have all been satisfactorily fulfilled.
The visit of the Chinese acrobatic troupe to Finland in 1952, as well as the visit to China of the Finnish cultural delegation led by Madame Kekkonen in 1953, and the visit to Finland in July 1954 of Deputy Minister Lei Renmin of the Chinese Ministry of For-eign Trade at the invitation of the Finnish government have all left lasting and good impressions on our peoples and have contributed greatly to the strength-ening of the friendly feelings between the people of China and the people of Finland, and to their mutual confidence in peaceful cooperation.
The friendly cooperative relationship between China and Finland provides ample evidence that nations of diverse social systems can coexist peacefully and be in friendly cooperation with one another.
Now we have escalated our legations to each other to the status of embassies and we have exchanged ambassadors.
This sig-nifies that a further step has been taken in the consolidation and promotion of friendly relations between our two countries.
China and Finland share a common hope for the defense and consolidation of peace, and the enhancement of economic and cultural exchange between our two countries is bound to have a beneficial effect on the safeguarding and consolidating of world peace.
We are convinced that the trade relations and the cultural inter-flow between China and Finland will continue to be strength-ened and develop.
Mr.
Ambassador, I welcome your expressed wish that therebe more direct contact between the representatives of our countries.
I heartily welcome your assuming the position of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Finland to the People’s Republic of China and pledge to you my assistance and the assistance of the government of the People’s Republic of China in your work of strengthening the friendly cooperation between China and Finland.
I wish you success in your mission, and I express my good wishes for the prosperity of the Republic of Finland the happiness of the people of Finland and the health of President J.

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, we represent the Chi-nese people and the government of the People’s Republic of China in sincerely extending our warm congratulations to you and, through you, to the great people and government of the Soviet Union.
In the past five years, the overall political, economic, and cultural coopera-tion between China and the Soviet Union has developed extensively.
The Gov-ernment and people of the Soviet Union have given all-round and systematic assistance—assistance that leaves no detail unattended—to us, the Chinese people, who are in the midst of pursuing socialist construction.
The govern-ment of the Soviet Union has successively helped China build from scratch and expand 156 huge industrial enterprises, sent excellent experts in large numbers to assist China in its construction, extended to China favorable loans several times, transferred to China without cost the Sino-Soviet jointly managed Chi-na-Changchun railway and property in Northeast China acquired by Soviet organizations from Japanese owners in 1945, sold to China shares owned by the Soviet Union in Sino-Soviet joint enterprises, and decided to place total-ly at China’s disposal the naval base at Lüshun and installations in that area jointly used by China and the Soviet Union.
Moreover, it has also proposed to offer to China scientific, technological, and industrial assistance in promoting research in peaceful uses for atomic energy.
Such friendly cooperation and sin-cere aid have greatly promoted the development of our country’s undertakings in construction and demonstrate to the world the great vitality of this new kind of international relations.
The government of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people deeply appreciate the unmatched treasure that this brotherly friendship represents.
On behalf of the government of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people, we express sincere gratitude for the tremendous assistance of the government and people of the Soviet Union.
The consolidation and development of the friendship and alliance between China and the Soviet Union has been invaluable in guaranteeing our two countries’ security and maintaining peace in the Far East and in the world.
The peace policy of China and the Soviet Union has promoted and brought about the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, bringing about a certain degree of relaxation in international tensions and inspiring all peace-loving countries and peoples.
The Chinese people enthusiastically sup-port the Soviet Union’s struggle for the establishment of a European collective security system and its opposition to the rearmament of West Germany.
Chinaand the Soviet Union are willing to establish normalized relations with Japan and to actively support the Japanese people in taking the road of independent development and international cooperation.
The sincere cooperation between China and the Soviet Union conforms to the interests not only of the people of the two countries, China and the Soviet Union, but also of all the peace— loving countries and peoples of Asia, Europe, and the rest of the world.
It is a reliable guarantee for the maintenance of peace in the Far East and the world.
At this very moment, the aggressive clique of the United States and its followers are pursuing a policy of war and creating international tension ev-erywhere, and the aggressive behavior and war provocations carried out by the United States in the Taiwan area are a grave threat to China’s security.
It has given rise to just reprobation by peace-loving countries and peoples through-out the world.
The struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their own terri-tory of Taiwan is just.
A just cause is something that no force can stop.
The friendship and alliance of China and the Soviet Union, in view of the emerging international tension, will play an increasingly vital role in the cause of oppos-ing aggression and guaranteeing peace.
The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is a great peace treaty, a symbol of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
The events of the last five years have proved this treaty’s great role in promoting world peace and human progress.
From now on, in life and in practice, this treaty’s great force and boundless brilliance will be further exhibited.
For the sake of the common prosperity of the two peoples of China and the Soviet Union and the consolidation of peace in the Far East and in the world, may the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union develop daily.
Long live the eternal, indestructible friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

In the Second World War, the glorious armed forces of the Soviet Union, with their invincible might, devastated the forces of Fascism, defended Euro-pean and world civilization, and made invaluable contributions to the cause of human progress.
Now, at the very moment when the imperialist war bloc is intensifying its creation of international tension, preparing for atomic war, carrying out war provocations, and gravely threatening world peace, the strong and long-tested armed forces of the Soviet Union are an invincible force for defending the peace of the world.
The armed forces of the Soviet Union that were stationed at the Lüshun naval base in accordance with the Sino-Soviet agreement have played an im-portant role in defending peace and security in the Far East and throughout the world in the last five years.
They have provided powerful support to the Chinese people in their cause of socialist construction.
Now, as they depart from the Lüshun naval base in accordance with the Sino-Soviet communi-que of October 1954, on behalf of the government and people of the People’s Republic of China, we extend our heartfelt thanks to the government of the Soviet Union and to the great Soviet people and their armed forces.
May the armed forces of the Soviet Union achieve even more brilliant suc-cesses in the tasks of strengthening the national defense forces of their own homeland and defending world peace and security.

Lin Tie (b.

Lin played a significant role in promoting the cooperativization movement at this time, and later, in the Socialist education movement in the countryside.

This refers to the problem that was reflected in a letter written by the masses in Anping xian.
In this letter, they reported that, in the process of promoting agricultural cooperativ-ization, the local cadres in that xian simplistically used such propaganda and coercive tactics as saying “either you follow the Communist Party or you follow Lao Jiang (Old Chiang [Kai-shek])” to force the peasants into joining the cooperatives.
Such tactics had led to a serious problem of lowering the peasants productivity and activism.

Speech at Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the CPC373 Spring 1955 Last year Comrade XXX was instructed to sum up and examine the work of traditional Chinese doctors.
374 This year, it has been found that people at the lower level are against traditional doctors and medicinal herbs.
The Chairman has instructed Comrade XXX to see that good results are produced in respect of the work of traditional doctors and medicinal herbs within a time limit.
For the past several years almost everything has been liberated.
Operas, too, have been liberated.
Yet traditional Chinese medicine has not been liberated.
The health of six hundred million people in China depends primarily on traditional Chinese medicine, and not on Western medicine.
This is because the number of Western doctors is small.
Doctors of traditional Chinese medicine play a very significant role in the health of people, but this fact is seldom reflected in the leadership because doctors of traditional Chinese medicine are out of 372.

power while doctors of Western medicine are in power.
Chinese medicine has a long history, and this very fact proves that it has made great contributions to the people.
It is necessary to set up institutions to study Chinese medicine.
Some doctors of Chinese medicine are so influenced by Western medicine in their advanced studies that they say Chinese medi-cine is unscientific.
While it is unscientific for them to say so, they must not be criticized too early, and should be treated in the same manner as national minorities are treated.
They should play a part in various institutions.
To look down upon Chinese medicine is a slavish bourgeois idea, and something must be wrong that no good results have been produced for the past several years.
.
.
In the future, graduates of medical universities shall be required to study Chinese medicine for two years.
It should be admitted that doctors of Chinese medicine are capable and should be treated as specialists and received and paid as specialists.
Haven’t they performed great merits? We must oppose sectarianism among doctors of Chinese medicine and step up research of Chinese medicine.
(Turning to He Zheng) Isn’t there a Qizhou in Hebei? That is the place for concentration and dispersal of medicinal herbs.
Commercial departments must study it.
Telegram to the People’s Republic of Hungary April 2, 1955 Comrade Istvan Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People’s Republic of Hungary, Comrade Andros Hegedus, Acting Chairman of the Council of the People’s Republic of Hungary, Comrade Janos Boldoczki, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Re-public of Hungary: On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Hungary’s liberation, we con-vey to you and, through you, to the Hungarian people and the government of the People’s Republic of Hungary sincere and warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese people and the People’s Republic of China.
In the last ten years, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of their own Hungarian Workers’ Party and the government of the People’s Republic of Hungary, have victoriously consolidated the people’s democratic system andhave achieved brilliant successes in the socialist construction of their country.
These successes have strengthened the socialist camp for peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union and have inspired the Chinese people who are in the midst of pursuing their socialist construction.
The Chinese people greet the victories of our brothers, the Hungarian people with very joyful feelings.
We wish the Hungarian people new victories in the cause of socialist con-struction in their own homeland and in the struggle to smash the new war plans of the imperialist aggressive bloc and to ensure peace in Europe and throughout the world.

Order to Terminate State of War between the PRC and Germany375 April 7, 1955 Owing to the fact that Hitler’s Germany had unleashed a fascist war of aggression that undermined world peace and had supported Japan’s war of aggression against China, China proclaimed itself to be in a state of war with Germany on December 9, 1941.
After the Hitlerian aggressors were wiped out, the Potsdam Conference of 1945 resolved that Germany ought to develop into a peaceful, democratic, and unified state and also decided on the approach to concluding a peace treaty with Germany.
376 However, because of the policy consistently pursued by the United States, Britain, and France of dividing Germany, reviving militarism in West Germa-ny in order to bring it into aggressive military blocs, Germany is still divided and it is still impossible to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.
Now the 375.
Comrade Mao drafted the above resolution, which was adopted by the Ninth meeting of the Standing Committee of the First National People’s Congress.
376.
The Potsdam Conference was the last summit conference held among the heads of the governments of the US, Britain, and the USSR—during the Second World War.
It took place July 17 to August 2, 1945.
One of its resolutions was to create a foreign ministers’ Council consisting of the US, Britain, the USSR, France, and eventually China, to draft the peace treaties with Germany and the other Axis powers.
three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, are all actively plotting by implementing the Paris agreements377 to further obstruct the peaceful uni-fication of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, thus posing a serious threat to peace and security in Europe.
The People’s Republic of China resolutely supports the German Democrat-ic Republic and the people of all of Germany, as well as the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, in their struggle to attain the peaceful unification of Germany, the promotion of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the safeguarding of European collective security, and the defense of world peace.
At the same time, [the People’s Republic of China,] in the inter-ests of the Chinese people and the people of all Germany, and based on the resolution adopted by the Ninth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the First National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China on April 7, 1955, proclaims: The state of war between the People’s Republic of China and Germany shall end forthwith.
Peaceful relations between the two countries shall be es-tablished.
The termination of the state of war between the People’s Republic of China and Germany does not in any way change Germany’s international obligations.
At the same time it also does not in any way affect the rights or commitments of the People’s Republic of China under international agreements relating to Germany.

The Paris conference, a crucial prelude to the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), was held October 20-23, 1954.
It resulted in the signing of the Protocol on the Termination of the Occupational Regime in the Federal Republic of Ger-many (FDR) on October 23, 1954, and on May 5, 1955, the formal accession of the FDR to NATO was ratified.
tween our two countries will, on the existing basis, grow even more intimate with each passing day.
The advancement of such friendly relations will not only further consolidate the friendship between the people of our two countries but will also contribute to the peace in Asia and in the world for which the people of all nations are striving.
The government of the People’s Republic of China and myself welcome Your Excellency’s appointment as the ambassador extraordinary and plenipo-tentiary of Pakistan to the People’s Republic of China and pledge our full as-sistance in your work to strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two countries and to safeguard international peace.

Inscription for Czechoslovakian Exhibition April 28, 1955 The exhibition378 on the achievements of ten years of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia has made a deep impression on us.
Over the past ten years, socialist Czechoslovakia has made rapid progress in the areas of the economy and culture.
This comes as a result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the government of Czechoslovakia and the efforts of all the laboring people of Czechoslovakia in striving for a happy life for themselves.
The fact that Czechoslovakia has made rapid progress in the area of industry, especially in the machine-building industry, greatly strengthens the confidence of the Chinese people in their undertaking of industrialization which has just be-gun.
It also projects an ever broadening vista for future trade development and scientific and technical cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia.
May Czechoslovakia become more prosperous and powerful with each passing day.
May the friendship between the people of Czechoslovakia and the people of the People’s Republic of China always continue to grow and be consolidated.

Letter to Jiang Zhuru May 1, 1955 My Dear Zhuru:379 Your gracious letter of February has been received; thank you very much.
You are engaged in linguistic studies and have proposed some unconventional opinions.
Although I cannot agree with you [on these views], I am sure that the debate would be beneficial [to all of us].
Your letter has been sent to the Committee for Language Reform for studying.
A phonetic language is by and large a form of language that is more convenient and easy to handle.
Chinese characters are too complicated and difficult.
At the moment we are only en-gaged in reforming [the language] by simplifying them; in the future, there will come the day when we have to carry out some basic reforms.

Jiang Zhuru was a fellow native of Mao’s of Xiangtan xian, Hunan.
He was Mao’s schoolmate at the First Normal School of Hunan in Changsha, and an early member of the Xinmin Xuehui (New People’s Study Society) founded by Mao.
He was engaged in education work.
ment of liberation, the Chinese people and the government of the People’s Republic of China express warm congratulations to you and, through you, to our brothers the German people and the government of the German Demo-cratic Republic.
After the army of the Soviet Union smashed Hitler’s fascist rule, the Ger-man people, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, carried out all sorts of democratic reforms and established their own German Democratic Republic.
In the past five years, the people of the German Demo-cratic Republic have triumphantly built a new life with their own creative labor and have made gigantic achievements in the areas of politics, the economy, and culture.
The German Democratic Republic has become the strong bulwark of the German people in their struggle to attain unification, peace, democracy, and independence.
Ignoring the national interests of the German people, the ruling cliques of the United States and Britain have actively revived German militarism and deepened the division of Germany in an attempt to convert West Germany into the hotbed of a new war.
The recent ratification of the Paris Agreement has greatly increased the danger of war and posed a serious threat to peace in Europe and the world.
The Chinese people fully support all the necessary measures that the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and other peace-loving European countries have taken to ensure their own security and to safeguard European and world peace.
They also deeply believe that the pow-erful unity of the countries within the socialist camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union is bound to thoroughly smash all the imperialist plans for war and that the righteous cause of the German people is bound to achieve success.
We sincerely wish the German people new successes in their struggle to op-pose the implementation of the Paris Agreement and in their cause of building the German Democratic Republic.

Telegram to the Republic of Czechoslovakia May 7, 1955 Comrade Antonin Zapotocky, President of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, Comrade Zdenek Fierlinger, Chairman of the National Assembly of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, Comrade Viliam Siroky, Prime Minister of the Republic of Czechoslovakia: On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the achievement of liberation by the Czechoslovakian people, the government of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese people extend to the government of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovakian people their warm and heartfelt con-gratulations.
Over the past ten years, the Czechoslovakian people, under the correct lead-ership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and with the selfless help rendered by the Sovi-et Union, have made brilliant achievements in the area of consolidating the political power of the people’s democracy and laying the foundation for the construction of socialism.
These achievements add to the strength of the world camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union and lend great encouragement to the Chinese people who are in the midst of pursuing socialist construction.
Currently the imperialist aggressive bloc is sparing no effort to carry into effect the Paris Agreement and is actively reviving German militarism, thus forcing the people of Europe and of the entire world to confront the threat of a new war.
The Chinese people fully support all necessary measures taken by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other peace-loving countries and peoples in Europe to safeguard their own security and European peace.
We are deeply convinced that with the sympathy and support of the people all over the world, the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union is bound to smash the imperialists’ war plans.
We wish the Czechoslovakian people still greater triumphs in their cause of building socialism and defending peace.

Letter to the Party Committee of Xiangxiang xian380 May 17, 1955 Comrades of the CPC Party Committee of Xiangxiang xian and, through them, comrades of the Second District Committee and the Party Branch of Shidong xiang: Tan Shiying of Shidong xiang was a classmate of mine some forty years ago at the Dongshan School of Xiangxiang.
Since Liberation, he has sent me several letters and I sent several letters in reply.
Because he claimed and com-plained that he is in [financial] difficulty, recently I sent him some money.
Lately, he came down with an eye ailment and went to Hankou to look up Comrade Tan Zheng for help in getting treatment.
381 When he couldn’t find Tan there, he came to Beijing to look me up.
At the moment he is interned at a hospital for the treatment of his eye and will be on his way back to the village in two or three weeks.
I have bade him to listen well to the teaching and discipline of the Party and government cadres of the local district and the xiang.
According to what he told me, two of his sons were executed some three years ago in the struggle to suppress counterrevolutionaries.
One of them was a battalion commander and the other a squad commander.
Allegedly they were executed because they had committed crimes involving the shedding of other people’s blood.
He himself was deprived of his civilian rights and was subjected to control and surveillance for a year.
At the present moment, that has been lifted but he still cannot join the peasant’s association.
His wife and two other sons, meanwhile, retained their civilian rights and have joined the peasants’ association.
He claims that his background is that of a poor peasant.
He also claims that he had been a schoolteacher for several decades, and that except for 380.
Xiangxiang xian is adjacent to Xiangtan in the province of Hunan (Xiangtan is Mao’s native village).
Shidong xian is also in the area.

I managed to get [from them] even more material, confirming what I said at the Supreme State Conference.
Nevertheless, a further investigation and study is needed to ascertain whether or not things are truly as we have thought.
When you, dear sir, go down [to the lower levels] to make your inspection and investigation, I hope you will use a method of comprehensive, all-round analysis.
I have seen the material of the Association for Democratic National Construction, and I am very much interested.

See Letter to the Party Committee of Xiangxiang xian, p.
318 of this volume.
Here MaoI have received your letter of June 4 and your masterpiece.
Thank you very much.
I approve of your idea of returning to your native village soon.
The xian committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Xiangxiang [xian] sent me a letter (I also received one from the Party branch of the xiang) which clarified a few things concerning your family’s circumstances.
According [to these re-ports]: your two sons are indeed guilty; this is because, even after having been forgiven and released several times, they kept returning to their criminal ways, and because they have committed serious crimes.
Therefore it is only their just deserts that the government and the people have dealt with them in accor-dance with the law.
On your part, [it was decided that] you only have some of the shortcomings brought over from the old society and a few improprieties regarding the attitude with which you have treated your two sons.
For that rea-son you have been subjected to a year of probationary control and surveillance; now that has been lifted.
The letter of the xian [party] committee indicates that they have not found you guilty of anything else.
I think that the comments that the [Party] committee made regarding you are fair and just.
You ought to [learn to] look at problems from the perspective of the funda-mental changes between the old and the new societies, and gradually change around your own thoughts and temperament.
In this way you can become more open-minded, and you can change and get rid of some of your faults and lead your entire family in promoting diligence and hard work at production.
The most important thing is for you to obey the laws and ordinances of the government and listen to the cadres.
In this way, in a few years, people’s atti-tude toward you will change even more for the better.
If you feel the need to do so, you may show this letter to the comrades in positions of responsibility in the xian, or district, or xiang.
I wish you peace.

In May 1955 Mao instructed the security guards to train themselves by writing reports about their experiences after they had gone home for vacations.
Most of these reports were about their home villages and districts.
Mao personally made comments and corrections on these reports.
Some of these conversation excerpts reflect Mao’s responses.
Comrade Kim Il Sung, Premier of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Comrade Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea: On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people, on behalf of the Chinese government and people of the Peoples Re-public of China we extend to you, and through you, to the government and people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea our sincere and warm congratulations.
In the ten years since the great army of the Soviet Union defeated the Japa-nese militarists, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Worker’s Party and the government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, have carried out unflagging struggle for the peace, unification and independence of their homeland.
After the Korean Armistice in 1953, the Korean people have also carried out the arduous task of restoring and developing their national economy and have achieved great successes.
These achievements of the Korean people have given the greatest inspiration and support to the Chinese people, who are in the midst of their socialist construction.
Since the Korean Armistice, the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers have strictly abided by the agreements of the Korean Armi-stice, and the two governments of Korea and China have all along worked for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question by the principle of negotiation; but the enemies of peace have seized every opportunity to plot to undermine the Armistice, such that the Korean Armistice is still in a state of instability.
Never-theless, the Korean Armistice agreement cannot be allowed to be undermined and a peaceful resolution of the Korean question must be actualized.
May the Korean people achieve even greater victories in their struggle for the peace, unification, and independence of their homeland.
The Korean peo-ple will forever have the deep sympathy and fullest support of the Chinese people and government in this struggle.
May you achieve even greater successes in the cause of strengthening the democratic bases and restoring and developing your national economy.

With feelings of boundless elation, the government and people of the Peo-ple’s Republic of China have watched the great successes achieved during the past eleven years by the People’s Republic of Romania under the leadership of the Romanian Workers’ Party in the cause of socialist construction.
These suc-cesses have added to the strength of the socialist camp for peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union.
May our brothers, the Romanian people, achieve new victories in the cause of consolidating and winning prosperity for their homeland and in defending peace in Europe and throughout the world.
May the unbreakable friendship between China and Romania be further consoli-dated and developed.

Telegram to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam September 1, 1955 Comrade Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Ton Duc Thang, Acting President of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Pham Van Dong, Vice-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Vietnam: On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on behalf of the government and people of the People’s Republic of China, we extend to you and, through you, to the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam our warm and heartfelt congratulations.
In the last ten years, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers’ Party and President Ho Chi Minh, have carried out a heroic and arduous struggle in opposing colonial aggression and in striving for peace, unification, independence, and democracy, and have achieved great victories.
These victories not only have inspired all peoples struggling for national in-dependence and freedom but have also contributed greatly to the cause of defending peace in Asia and throughout the world.
The Chinese people are overjoyed and filled with admiration for this.
In 1954, at the Geneva Conference an agreement was reached on restoring peace to Indochina and actualizing Vietnam’s unification through nationwideelections; however, at present the enemies of peace are still scheming to un-dermine the implementation of the Geneva Agreements.
This is totally im-permissible by all those who uphold justice.
The Chinese people give all their sympathy and support to the Vietnamese people in their continuous efforts in struggling to actualize the Geneva Agreements thoroughly and to convene a consultative conference between the north and the south in preparation for free elections throughout the country.
May the Vietnamese people achieve even greater victories in the struggle for peace, independence, unification, and democracy! May you achieve further successes in the tasks of consolidating the demo-cratic political power, healing war wounds, and restoring and developing your national economy!

Conversation with Members of the Japanese Diet396 October 15, 1955 “Communism arose from war — the Soviet Union after World War One, and many other Communist nations after World War Two.
If world war three should start, at least 80 percent of the world will become communized.

So, there is no reason for us to be fearful of war.
Moreover, we have no colonies.
We have nothing to lose.

I did not like Japan before because there were militarists, but now I like Japan because there are no more milita-rists.
I sympathize with Japan because she is being ill-treated by other coun-tries.

China is still an agricultural nation, but I would like to say that Red China is exerting efforts to become an industrialized agricultural nation.
Japan is more advanced than my country in industry, economy, and culture, and there is need for the Chinese People’s Republic to learn many things from Japan.

Reply to Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Germany December 3, 1955 The Democratic Republic of Germany is the first truly peace-loving dem-ocratic state in German history.
The Democratic Republic of Germany has achieved tremendous success in the struggles of building socialism, striving for the peaceful unification of Germany, and safeguarding European and world peace.
The Democratic Republic of Germany has already become a strong bul-wark of the forces of peace and democracy in all of Germany and an important factor in maintaining European security and world peace.
I am confident that the construction of socialism in the Democratic Republic of Germany and the German people’s struggle for the peaceful unification of Germany are bound to attain even greater victories.
In this struggle, the German people will continue to receive the full support of the Chinese people.
In the last few years, the close cooperation between our two countries in the areas of politics, the economy, and culture has brought about daily increasing consolidation and development in the friendship between our two peoples.
This overall cooperation and broth-erly friendship are in accord with our two people’s common interests and wish-es, and also serve to strengthen the force of the camp for peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union.

Talk on Opposing Right-Deviation and Conservatism December 6, 1955 To say the “Left” is better than the Right is incorrect; to say the Right is better than the “Left” is also incorrect.
Some people are falling behind reality in their thinking; they have no horns on their heads; they do not posses spirit.
In the struggle between the two lines they do not carry out criticism, or if they do, their criticism is blunted.
They are afraid of criticism and are afraid of losing votes.
All these are manifestations of a Right deviation, and it is necessary to oppose them in the Party.
The Sixth Plenum of the Central Committee crit-icized the Right-deviationist empiricism of the Rural [Work] Department.
407 That the thinking of the leadership has fallen behind reality is a grave problem.

For criticism on Rural Work Department, see The Debate On the Co-operative Transfor-mation of Agriculture and the Current Class Struggle, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V.
In the transformation of capitalism, in the suppression of counterrevolution-aries, and in the cooperativization [movement], it’s all like that.
We underesti-mated our own capacity.
In the past, agriculture lagged behind industry.
After the Seventeen-Article [Program] came out,408 agriculture caught up with in-dustry and forced industry to make progress.
For instance, it would have been to our disadvantage had we allowed the elementary [agricultural producers] cooperatives409 to remain as they were for three or four years without advancing to the higher stage.
It is possible that socialism will be realized in 1959.
The idea of the Seventeen Articles is to oppose conservatism.
[It involves] overall planning, the strengthening of the leadership, fundamental measures, and ad-vanced experience.
Half a year ago, we did not consider these, now we have changed.
Tremendous changes and immense productive power have emerged as if a new continent has been discovered.
The new continent has been in existence; it’s just we did not see it.
The socialist transformation of industry and commerce will be ninety percent completed in 1957.
The transformation of handicraft industries must also be accelerated.
Our [current] plan is too modest; [we aim at] seventy to eighty percent transformation in 1957.
Orig-inally the nationalization of industry and commerce was planned for 1962; perhaps this can be accomplished ahead of schedule.
After [the stage of ] joint state-private ownership is reached, it is not difficult to transform it to state ownership.
Instead of taking the eighteen years [called for in the original plan], cooperativization took ten years.
This proves that we have fallen behind real-ity.
The masses have tremendous potential; they can tackle many things.
[So] we should oppose Right deviations and conservatism in order to accomplish transformation ahead of schedule.
I propose that we achieve our goals in excess of the targets before fifteen years and delete such uncertain expressions as “ap-proximately,” “basically,” and “about fifteen years.
” We should strive to achieve what can be achieved [through effort].
For instance, when we put in an order for products, we can demand earlier delivery.
We should take advantage of this period of cessation of hostilities [with the United States] to speed up the tempo and accomplish our general tasks.
This is the idea of the “Eighth Congress.
” If we can accomplish the general tasks of the period of transition ahead of sched-408.

The elementary co-operative characterized by the pooling of land as shares and unified management was semi-socialist in nature.
It maintained private ownership by the co-oper-ative members of such means of production as land, draught animals and the larger farm implements, and the co-operative had to pay “dividends” to its members for their use.
The elementary co-operative was therefore said to have retained semi-private ownership.
ule, things on the battlefield will be easily handled.
It is most advantageous to have things done quickly, for then we will be in a better position to fight Taiwan if we have to.
But if we don’t fulfill our tasks of construction, it will be difficult.
We must accelerate and achieve faster, greater, and better [results] in all aspects of our work.
We must obtain better results in a shorter period of time.
If we undertake things for which there are adequate conditions, if they stem from the masses’ demands, and if we accomplish more and better results that would mean that we are advancing steadily.
In the past we made [some] mistakes in opposing blind and adventurist advance; we dampened the activ-ism of the cadres and the masses.
This was wrong.
I he movement to eliminate illiteracy was swept away by the movement to oppose adventurist advance.
The good spirit of uprightness was repressed, and there was an upsurge in evil and sinister influence; both the cadres and the masses lost their drive.
By not having been able to notice such a problem at the very earliest opportunity the Center has neglected its duty.
The masses say.
“One can’t go wrong in following the Communist Party”.
In terms of general orientation, we have not been wrong.
But in specific cases, we have made mistakes, and the masses have also made mistakes in following us.
There are several ways in which to advance: the best, the mediocre, and the not so good.
The more correct and reasonable line is to stand in front of the masses and to give them encouragement to go forward, and not to stand behind them and pour cold water on them, if we achieve comparatively great accomplishments in a comparatively short time, we will be advancing steadily, whereas if we do things in the conventional way, spending a longer time but achieving little, we will be following the conservative line.
There are two ways to overcome this; overall planning and getting close to the masses.
It is not the method of sitting in the office, but rather, getting close to the masses to find out new things, new experiences, [to gather] advanced ex-periences and popularize them.
One does not have to catch many sparrows to know [a sparrow’s] insides.
If you know that Zhejiang and Anhui can carry out cooperativization quickly, you’ll know that the same can be done nationally.
Conservatism is not any one individual’s problem.
Take hold of the advanced [experiences] in order to criticize the backward; discover new productive forces and the potential of the masses.
This is a principle of leadership, a method of leadership; only with this can we convince people.
It will not do to sit in the office not getting close to the masses and not taking hold of the advanced experiences.
Official business has indeed to be transacted, but it will not do to limit yourselves to transacting official business alone.
Even when you go out[for an inspection], you have to take hold of the advanced; you can’t simply engage in some laggardly projects and bring them back with you.
People who are in responsible positions should allot seven to ten weeks [a year] as a period for getting close to the masses.
The work-style of sitting in the office can only [be used in] dealing with conventional matters.
Advanced experience [can be had] only by breaking through convention.
In the things of objective reality, breakthroughs are made every day; imbalance is a constant, while equilibrium is only temporary.
This is the law of progress.
The viewpoint that there can be no further change after equilibrium is achieved is incorrect.
On the contrary, it is only when one takes hold of the advanced [elements] in disequilibrium and uses them to bring the rest forward that there can be progress.
One should not be afraid of breakthroughs or of the emergence of contradictions.
Perpetual peace and tranquility are bound to produce mistakes.
There are dialectics only when there are both breakthroughs and the attempt to achieve equilibrium.
Only in this way can we stir up the activism of the masses and hasten the construction of socialism.
We should [build socialism] with faster, more, and better [results], fulfill [this task] in excess of the targets in less than fifteen years, and thus advance steadily.
Comparing our country with the Soviet Union: (1) We had more than twenty years’ experience in the base areas and the practice of the three revolu-tionary wars.
We are extremely rich in experience.
By the time of the victory [of 1949] we had already accumulated experience in every area, and we’ve had Right and Left deviations quite a few times.
We quickly formed our state and accomplished our revolutionary tasks [whereas] in the case of the Soviet Union, it was a newly started business for them; at the time of the October Revolution, they had no army, no government, and few Party members).
(2) We have the help of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries.
(3) Our population is large and our location is good.
Though diligent and able to endure hardship, the peasants will have no future if they do not cooperativize.
Chinese peasants are even better than British and American workers; we can therefore step into socialism faster and with greater and better results.
We should not always com-pare ourselves with the Soviet Union.
After three five-year plans we shall be able to produce twenty-four million tons of steel.
This is faster than the Soviet Union.
Right now the two flanks are riding high, and the main body is possibly lagging behind.
The two flanks are prone to be conceited, but it is the indus-trial sector that is most prone to be conceited, especially heavy industry.
The Anshan [Iron and Steel Works], for instance, has already become conceited.
Itis very possible for a nation to become socialized without being industrialized (with the proportion [of industry] less than sixty percent, the system is not yet established).
Can we ask the peasants to wait? This is impossible.
The socializa-tion of the peasants does not hinder industrialization.
We cannot make them wait.
The work at the two flanks has been seriously examined.
In addition, we ought to have a serious examination of the problem of industry and (make industry] go through big campaigns according to schedule.
We should investi-gate financial and fiscal matters, trade, and cultural and educational matters as well.
The Eighth [Party] Congress should make a summing-up investigation.
This is the central problem.
We should oppose conservatism, Right deviation, passivity, and arrogance; we should discover advanced experience, change the method of leadership, and achieve faster and better results.
We should mobilize the masses to conduct criticism and self-criticism, to overcome conservatism, and to score greater achievements.
The whole Party must be prepared, and the entire nation must be prepared.

Letter to Zhai Zuojun December 12, 1955 Comrade Zuojun:410 Your letter of December 2 has been received.
I am very happy to receive it.
I guess you have returned to Taiyuan.
I have also received some of your earlier letters, but it seems to me that I may not have received all of them.
We are all very well here.
I hope that you will do a good job of studying.
When next you come to Beijing, please let us know ahead of time ([you may] contact Li Yinqiao, the commander of my bodyguards, on the telephone), and we should arrange for a meeting.

1956Talk at the Conference on Intellectuals Called by the Centre (Excerpt) January 20, 1956 The target plans of all the departments should be practicable, what can be and should be done but has not yet been done, is [due to] rightist conserva-tism; what is ill-founded and completely unworkable and yet is being done, is [due to] a blindness or ‘leftist’ adventurism.
In my view, this [the leftist adventurism] is not the general orientation of the whole party, although it is detectable.
Some comrades are a bit wooly and dare not say that they are being realistic because of the ugly label of rightist conservatism and opportunism.
If they examine and study [things carefully], [they will be able to] say or insist on saying what cannot be done.
What cannot be done should be deleted from our plans so that they may rest on a solid, reliable basis.

Contradictions Under Socialism April 5, 1956 Some naïve ideas seem to suggest that contradictions no longer exist in a socialist society.
To deny the existence of contradictions is to deny dialectics.
The contradictions in various societies differ in character, as do forms of their solution, but society at all times develops through continual contradictions.
Socialist society also develops through contradictions between the productive forces and the conditions of production.
In a socialist or communist society, technical innovations and improvement in the social system inevitably contin-ue to take place; otherwise the development of society would come to a stand-still and society could no longer advance.
Humanity is still in its youth.
The road it has yet to traverse will be no one knows how many times longer than the road it has already traveled.
Contradictions between progress and conser-vatism, between the advanced and the backward, between the positive and the negative, will constantly occur under varying conditions and different circum-stances.
Things will keep on like this: One contradiction will lead to another,and when old contradictions are solved new ones will arise.
It is obviously incorrect to maintain, as some people do, that the contradiction between ide-alism and materialism can be eliminated in a socialist or communist society.
As long as contradictions exist between the subjective and the objective, between the advanced and the backward and between the productive forces and the conditions of production, the contradiction between materialism and idealism will continue in a socialist or communist society and will manifest itself in vari-ous forms.
Since man lives in society, he reflects, in different circumstances and to varying degrees the contradictions existing in each form of society.
Therefore not everybody will be perfect, even when a communist society is established.
By then there will still be contradictions among the people, and there will still be good people and bad people, people whose thinking is relatively correct and others whose thinking is relatively incorrect.
Hence there will still be struggle between people, though its nature and form will be different from those in class societies.
Viewed in this light, the existence of contradictions between the individual and the collective in a socialist society is nothing strange.

Stalin’s Place in History April 5, 1956 After Lenin’s death, Stalin, as the chief leader of the Party and the state, creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism.
In the struggle to defend the legacy of Leninism against its enemies—the Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and other bourgeois agents—Stalin expressed the will and wishes of the people and proved himself to be an outstanding Marxist-Leninist fighter.
The reason Stalin won the support of the Soviet people and played an important role in history was primarily that he, together with the other leaders of the Commu-nist Party of the Soviet Union, brought about the triumph of socialism in the Soviet Union and created the conditions for the victory of the Soviet Union in the war against Hitler; these victories of the Soviet people conformed to the interests of the working class of the world and all progressive mankind.
It was therefore quite natural for the name of Stalin to be greatly honored throughout the world.
But, having won such high honor among the people both at homeand abroad by his correct application of the Leninist line, Stalin erroneously exaggerated his own role and counter-posed his individual authority to the col-lective leadership, and as a result certain of his actions were opposed to certain fundamental Marxist-Leninst concepts he himself had propagated Marxist-Leninists hold that leaders play a big role in history.
The people and their parties need forerunners who are able to represent the interests and will of the people, stand in the forefront of their historic struggles, and serve as their leaders.
But when any leader of the Party or the state places himself over and above the Party and the masses, instead of in their midst, when he alienates himself from the masses, he ceases to have all-around, penetrating insight into the affairs of the state.
As long as this was the case, even so out-standing a personality as Stalin could not avoid making unrealistic and errone-ous decisions on certain important matters.
.
.
During the later part of his life, Stalin took more and more pleasure in this cult of the individual and violated the Party’s system of democratic centralism and the principle of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility.
As a result, he made some serious mistakes: for example, he broadened the scope of the suppression of counter-revolution; he lacked the necessary vigilance on the eve of the an-ti-fascist war; he failed to pay proper attention to the further development of agriculture and the material welfare of peasantry; he gave certain wrong advice on the international communist movement, and, in particular, made a wrong decision on the question of Yugoslavia.
On these issues, Stalin fell victim to subjectivism and one-sidedness and divorced himself from objective reality and from the masses.
The cult of the individual is a rotten carry-over from the long history of mankind.
The cult of the individual is rooted not only in the exploiting classes but also in the small producers.
As is well known, patriarchism is a product of small-producer economy.
.
.
The struggle against the cult of the individual, which was launched by the Twentieth Congress, is a great and courageous fight by the communists and the people of the Soviet Union to clear away the ideological obstacles blocking their advance.
.
.
It must be pointed out that Stalin’s works should, as before, still be seriously studied and that we should accept all that is of value in them, as an important historical legacy, especially those many works in which he defended Leninism and correctly summarized the experience of building up the Soviet Union.
But there are two ways of studying them—the Marxist way and the doctrinaireway.
Some people treat Stalin’s writings in a doctrinaire manner and therefore cannot analyze and see what is correct and what is not—and everything that is correct they consider a panacea and apply indiscriminately, and thus inevitably they make mistakes.
For instance, Stalin put forward a formula that in differ-ent revolutionary periods the main blow should be so directed as to isolate the middle-of-the-road social and political forces of the time.
This formula of Sta-lin’s should be treated according to circumstances and from a critical, Marxist point of view.
In certain circumstances it may be correct to isolate the middle forces, but it is not correct to isolate them under all circumstances.
Our expe-rience teaches us that the main blow of the revolution should be directed at the chief enemy and to isolate him, whereas with the middle forces, a policy of both uniting with them and struggling against them should be adopted, so that they are at least neutralized; and, as circumstances permit, efforts should be made to shift them from their position of neutrality to one of alliance with us in order to facilitate the development of the revolution.
But there was a time— the ten years of civil war from 1927 to 1936—when some of our comrades crudely applied this formula of Stalin’s to China’s revolution by turning their main attack on the middle forces, singling them out as the most dangerous enemy; the result was that, instead of isolating the real enemy, we isolated our-selves and suffered losses to the advantage of the real enemy.
In the light of this doctrinaire error, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China during the period of the anti-Japanese war formulated a policy of developing the progressive forces, winning over the middle-of-the roaders, and isolating the diehards for the purpose of defeating the Japanese aggressors.
.
.
Some people consider that Stalin was wrong in everything.
This is a grave misconception.
Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninst, yet at the same time a Marxist-Leninst who committed several gross errors without realizing that they were errors.
We should view Stalin from a historical standpoint, make a proper and all round analysis to see where he was right and where he was wrong and draw useful lessons therefrom.
Both the things he did right and the things he did wrong were phenomena of the international communist movement and bore the imprint of the times.
Taken as a whole the international communist movement is only a little over hundred years old and it is only thirty-nine years since the victory of the October Revolution; experience in many fields of rev-olutionary work is still inadequate.
Great achievements have been made, but there are still shortcomings and mistakes… Reactionary forces the world over are pouring ridicule on this event: theyjeer at the fact that we are overcoming mistakes in our camp.
But what will come of all this ridicule? There is not the slightest doubt that these scoffers will find themselves facing a still more powerful, forever invincible, great camp of peace and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, while the murderous, blood-sucking enterprises of these scoffers will be in a pretty fix.

Speech at Expanded Meeting of CPC Political Bureau411 April 25, 1956 There are those who show no vigor and vitality in their expressions of opin-ion.
The relationship between the lower echelon and the higher echelon is like that of a mouse when it sees a cat.
It is as if their souls have been eaten away.
Thus many dare not speak up.
The various provinces have this same problem.
They are not sufficiently democratic, although the exemplary workers speak up quite spiritedly.
Our financial and economic conference and the Fourth Plena-ry Session of the Central Committee have an auxiliary function, because there are several rules and regulations on which not everyone dares speak appropri-ately and some comrades do not dare express themselves at all.
Another reason for this is that they do not have sufficient understanding of the situation and thus do not speak clearly and profoundly.
In regard to the financial and economic system, Comrades XXX and Hsien-nien have their own opinions, but this is not a question of men.
Only by changing the system can we change the way of doing things, and we must give some power to those below.
Our discipline has come mostly from Soviet Union.
By being too strict, we will tie the hands of the people.
If we cannot crush bureaucracy in this way, then the proletarian dictatorship must have an appropriate system.
In regard to the problem of the division of power between the central government and the local areas, and how the single-head system of the Soviet Union came about, the Political Bureau and the State Council have still been unable to make a decision.
If the various localities want division of power, they should not be fearful of talking of independence.
Since the central government has not made any decision on this, all of it can be brought up for discussion.
It is allowable 411.
In this connection also see comrade Mao’s article On Ten Major Relationships, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V, pp.
284-307.
for the various localities to first work up their own regulations, by-laws, meth-ods, and statutes.
We should allow the various localities to be full of creativity, spirit, and liveliness.
Starting next year, a large meeting should be held once a year.
On 1 May there need not be a large meeting; there can be small meetings and entertainment, and 1 May slogans of the Soviet Union need not be posted.
Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, we have been dull and mechanical, and lacking in spirit.
The Fourth Plenary Session should be convened.
Its resolutions are very necessary.
Letting Gao Gang hold sway for another year is unthinkable.
But this has produced an over cautiousness about everything, and some do not dare speak of national affairs, and this is not right.
Before the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central committee, there were some sabotage incidents; these must be overcome.
The sabotage activities of Kao and Jao should be terminated.
412 But some are overcautious and do not speak of national affairs.
A clear distinction should be made between two kinds of national affairs.
One type is destructive, like that of Kao and Jao, and should be opposed.
One type is constructive and should be thoroughly discussed.
At the time of the financial and economic conference,413 some comrades said the wrong thing and were subject to criticism, but the Kao and Jao affairs should be distinguished from them.
The party at the time of the Great Revolution was full for vitality.
Later Chen Duxiu committed the mistake of right opportun-ism, and subsequently also started the blind leftist movement.
414 After defeat, 412.
For more on Kao-Jao (Gao Gang-Rao Shushi) affair, see Speeches at the National Con-ference of the Communist Party of China, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V.
413.
The National Conference on Financial and Economic Work was held in the summer of 1953.
414.
Chen Duxiu was originally a professor at Beijing University and became famous as an editor of New Youth.
He was one of the founders of the Communist Party of China.
Because of his reputation at the time of the May 4th Movement and owing to the Par-ty’s immaturity in its initial period, he became General Secretary of the Party.
In the last period of the revolution of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in the Party represented by Chen Duxiu developed into a line of capitulationism.
Comrade Mao Tse-tung has observed that the capitulationists at that time “voluntarily gave up the Party’s leadership of the peasant masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and in particular gave up the Party’s leadership of the armed forces, thus causing the defeat of the revolution” (The Pres-ent Situation and Our Tasks, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume IV).
After the defeat of 1927 Chen Duxiu and a handful of other capitulationists lost faith in the future of the revolution and became liquidationists.
They took the reactionary Trotskyist stand and together with the Trotskyites formed a small anti-Party group.
Consequently Chen Duxiu was expelled from the Party in November 1929.
He died in 1942.
With reference to Chen Duxiu’s Right opportunism, see the introductory notes to Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society and to Report on the Investigation into the Peasant Movement in Hunan, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume I, and Introducing The Communist, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume II.
he was no longer lively.
In these eight years, the brief period following the “7 August” Conference415, the Sixth National Congress416 and the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee were correct.
417 During the period 415.
The CPC held an emergency conference of the Central Committee on August 7, 1927, at Kiukiang, Jiangxi Province.
The conference criticized the erroneous capitulationist line of the Right opportunist Chen Duxiu on the question of revolutionary leadership, revolution-ary armed forces and agrarian revolution and removed him from the leading post.
416.
The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in July 1928.
It pointed out that after the defeat in 1927, China’s revolution remained bourgeois-demo-cratic in nature, i.
e.
, anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, and that since the inevitable new high tide in the revolution was not yet imminent, the general line for the revolution should be to win over the masses.
The Sixth Congress liquidated the 1927 Right Capitulationism of Chen Duxiu and also repudiated the “Left” putschism which occurred in the Party at the end of 1927 and the beginning of 1928.
The congress adopted the following Ten-Point Programme: (I) overthrow imperialist rule; (2) confiscate foreign capitalist enterprises and banks; (3) unify China and recognize the right of the nationalities to self-determination; (4) overthrow the Kuomintang warlord government; (5) establish a government of councils of workers, peasants and soldiers; (6) institute the eight-hour day, increase wages, and establish unemployment relief and social insurance; (7) confiscate the land of all landlords and distribute the land among the peas-ants; (8) improve the living conditions of the soldiers, give land and jobs to ex-soldiers; (9) abolish all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and adopt a consolidated progres-sive tax; and (10) unite with the world proletariat, unite with the Soviet Union.
417.
The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party held in Sep-tember 1930, and the subsequent central leading body adopted many positive measures to put an end to the Li Lisan line.
But latter a number of Party comrades who were inex-perienced in practical revolutionary struggle, with Chen Shaoyu (Wang Ming) and Qin Bangxian (Po Ku) in the lead, came out against the Central Committee’s measures.
In the pamphlet The Two Lines or The Struggle for the Further Bolshevization of the Communist Party of China they most emphatically declared that the main danger then existing in the Party was not “Left” opportunism but “Right opportunism” and, to justify their own activities, they “criticized” the Li Lisan line as “Rightist”.
They put forward a new political program which continued, revived or developed the Li Lisan line and other “Left” ideas and policies in a new guise, and set themselves against the correct line of Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
It was mainly to criticize the military mistakes of this new “Left” opportunist line that Com-rade Mao Tse-tung wrote the article Problems of Strategy in China’s Revolutionary War.
This line was dominant in the Party from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in January 1931 to the meeting of the Political Bureau convened by the Central Committee at Zunyi, Guizhou Province, in January 1935, which ended the dominance of this erroneous line and established the new central leadership headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
The erroneous “Left” line dominated the Party for a particularly long time (four years) and brought extremely heavy losses, with disastrous consequences, to the Party and the revolution.
A loss of 90 percent was inflicted on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Red Army and its base areas, tens of millions of people in the revolutionary base areas were made to suffer the cruel oppression of the Kuomintang, and the progress of the Chinese revolution was retarded.
The overwhelming majority of the errant comrades have realized and corrected their mistakes through a long process of learning from experience and have done much good work for the Party and people.
Under Comrade Mao Zedong’s leadership they united with the masses of other comrades in the Party on the basis of a common political understanding.
of land reform, there were three leftist tendencies.
During the period of the anti-Japanese war, there was a rightist trend.
Two of the leftist trends were our own, and the third leftist trend and the Communist International were relat-ed to each other.
The Fourth Plenary Session’s resolutions on the third leftist trend were written by the Russians who forced us to accept them, especially the Wang Ming line.
It was the greatest loss to our revolutionary power, the loss incurred amounting to over 90 percent.
In view of this lesson, we should accept things analytically and critically.
Zhang Guotao was rightist.
418 During the Anti-Japanese War, he was also rightist.
The three rightist movements were especially for centralization, and they were not allowed to express a difference of views.
In defeat, they were not allowed to talk of defeat.
In view of the les-sons of history, later every effort was made to remedy the situation, and there was unity and fighting spirit.
During the period of the Anti-Japanese War, the spirit of independence of the base areas was very great, and local activism was given expression, but there was a kind of decentralization.
Some who were working for independence expressed what should not be expressed.
This was related to the Wang Ming line.
In order to correct this kind of phenomenon, the central government made the decision to strengthen party nature.
There was to be centralization, but a good deal of autonomy was preserved.
During the period of the War of Liberation, there was formulated the system of report-ing for instructions, rectifying the previous tendency of decentralization.
419 During the past few years, it has been irregular, and there has been more cen-tralization.
After all, how much autonomy should the industrial plants, the villages, the cooperatives, and the localities have? The Soviet Union during the past 40 years has had no experience in this, and we have no experience to study this.
Since some things are decided neither by the Central Government nor 418.
Zhang Guotao was a renegade from the Chinese revolution.
In early life, speculat-ing on the revolution, he joined the Chinese Communist Party.
In the Party he made many mistakes resulting in serious crimes.
The most notorious of these was his opposition, in 1935, to the Red Army’s northward march and his defeatism and liquidationism in advocating withdrawal by the Red Army to the minority-nationality areas on the Sich-uan-Xikang borders; what is more, he openly carried out traitorous activities against the Party and the Central Committee, established his own bogus central committee, disrupted the unity of the Party and the Red Army, and caused heavy losses to the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army.
But thanks to patient education by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and the Central Committee, the Fourth Front Army and its numerous cadres soon returned to the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and played a glorious role in sub-sequent struggles.
Zhang Guotao however, proved incorrigible and in the spring of 1938 he slipped out of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and joined the Kuomintang secret police.
419.
See On setting up a System of Reports, Selected works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume IV.
the localities, they are just carried out as such, as for example the single-head system.
Comrade Xuefeng would bring up the questions before the central government would discuss it.
Our party historically has had the overcentraliza-tion of the Wang Ming line and the over-decentralization of the Second Wang Ming line.
It is necessary to have an adequate amount of centralization, but too much centralization is not right and not beneficial for the mobilization of power to carry out large-scale economic reconstruction.
Our comrades will please study carefully our party’s history on this.
The question of the individual and the state, and the ratio of collective income.
I agree that 60-70 percent of the total income should go to the com-mune members, and 30-40 percent to the state and the commune.
At most this should not exceed 40 percent; and 30 percent is the best (including agri-cultural taxes, besides the cooperative public welfare fund, the public accumu-lation fund, administrative fees, etc.
) The question of the system of the socialist economy: The party committee system is not to be doubted.
Please study Lenin’s di-rectives.
The industrial plants and mines, cooperatives, commercial flow and transport, as well as other enterprises must have a definite independence, but the extent to which they should be independent should be carefully studied.
We are not Gao Gang’s Independent Kingdom, but should encourage open and legal “independent kingdoms” (not above the constitution) if we are to manage our affairs well.
If we have none of this at all, we cannot manage our affairs well.
How should the State Council have division of labor in man-agement and control? This must be studied in order to find a solution.
How many departments the central government should have and how much power they should have are questions which should be decided on shortly.
As to how many departments the localities should set up, over what matters they should have jurisdiction, and how much power they should have, we should draft a resolution on this within the next few months.
The various departments of the central government should stress the teaching of cadres for the lower levels to solve their problems.
When the localities come to the central government and cannot see the people in charge, and there is delay and indecision, some prob-lems do not get to be solved for several years, and the reasons for this should be studied.
These two problems need solution: What method should be used so that the people in charge can be seen, and also how can problems be expedi-tiously solved.
Will the various departments of the central government please give this their attention.
The localities have the power to resist all inoperable, impractical, and sub-jective orders, directives, instructions, and forms which the central govern-ment issues to the localities, and if they are restrained a bit more, it would not matter.
This power is only given to the provincial and municipal committees (which are comparatively more mature politically), and they are not given to the committees of the localities and the counties.
The Party regulations should show discipline and creativeness: the mass line should be manifested here, and the various provinces should study them a bit.
It will not do not to have discipline; but discipline, when enforced inflexibly, can obstruct an attitude of positivism.
Discipline which obstructs creativeness and positivism should be abolished In the draft party regulations it would be stipulated that a vice-chairman or several vice-chairmen should be designed.
Whether or not it is possible to emulate the methods of the Standing Com-mittee of the National People’s Congress and designate regular delegates with 5-year terms to serve in a supervisory function, is something to which everyone will please give consideration.
In the field of arts, “Let a hundred flowers bloom”; and in the literary field, “Let a hundred schools of thought contend” (as they contended during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period [722-481 BC]).
This should be our policy.
This was the view of the people 2,000 years ago.
Democratic control of the cooperatives is very important.
This is natural.
In collectivized labor, the peasants also should be given some free time.
It is right to listen to correct orders, but when orders are profuse, they become too inflexible and inoperative.
We also must have some liberalism; it will not do otherwise.
Strictness is derived from dealing with the unstrict.
Discipline arises from dealing with liberalism.
What we are opposed to is: We should not stir up the liberalism of the local liberals.
But we must have some liberalism in order to facilitate getting things done.
It will not do to be strict at all times.
It is still necessary to have liberalism within the family, otherwise each family will have to set up supervisory members.
It is necessary to have national balance.
Local independence should not obstruct national balance.
Only with national balance can there be partial bal-ance for the localities.
Without national balance, the country would be in great chaos.
Beijing’s things cannot match those of Shanghai, and they are afraid that Shanghai goods will flood the market.
So it is necessary to have national balance.
Without this balance, it will not be possible to make the nation indus-trialized.
When we encourage independence of the localities, we must not leanto one side.
Now it is necessary to stress independence.
We must positively touch on the economic activities of this year and next year.
Each provincial and municipal committee should report once, and work up some exemplary models.
We have had no experience in these matters, and must try to find some departments, districts, and industrial plants to study.
Other people say the central government has brilliant leadership.
We know some things, but also do not know other things.
In four days of meetings, we cannot talk about everything.
We have talked too little about the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, the unification of war efforts, the minority nationalities, and international problems.
Will the various areas please stress this to their subordinates.
We should take affirmative action in regard to the suppression of counterrevolutionaries.
In the past, we have killed, locked up, and controlled 2-3 million such persons, and this was extremely necessary.
Without this stroke, it would not do.
The democratic par-ties have divergent views form us.
Now the counterrevolutionaries are fewer.
We should take affirmative action to see if there are still any counterrevolu-tionaries, and this year decide upon having some of them killed.
They must be liquidated in the strategic organizations and schools.
Those not yet liquidated must be liquidated.
We cannot be lax and lenient; we must carry out this bitter task.
We should telephone once every half month to urge them into action.
You can also use the telephone method towards the local committees.
Punishment within the party: In regard to some cadres in the counties, districts, and townships, this has been too much and too severe.
In regard to high-level cadres (including bureau chiefs and above) who commit errors and on whom it is difficult to reach a conclusion, the punishment should be carried out (and the reasons therefore should be clearly investigated).
It is not right for the punishment to be severe and too heavy.
With the exception of the counter-revolutionaries, they should be given the chance to reform.
In regard to the problem of minority nationalities, Comrade XXX has said that Sichuan is right.
Although some retribution has been made, attention needs to be paid to other areas.
The question of international relations.
Some points should not be blind-ly followed.
On some matters we already have experience.
The Soviet Union has already initiated a mass criticism campaign.
Some of it is neither suitable for our country nor to the Soviet Union.
We have committed many errors in view of their direct leadership.
For example, in regard to the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, we would not catch most of them and would notkill many of them.
The single-head system is a military standpoint.
The mass line is still the standpoint of graceful favors.
Whether the method of capital accumulation should be by disparity (in prices between industrial goods and agricultural produce) or by tax collection is a problem.
But this is not to say that we have nothing to learn from the Soviet Union.
They have many things which are worthy of our study.
The Soviet Union helped us in our reconstruc-tion, and socialist countries are still the best at this.
Now even with this one country, although it has made many errors, there is still much that merits our study.
We should not follow blindly, but should subject everything to analysis.
There is good and bad in everything.
We cannot say that everything the Soviet Union docs is good.
Now, people are saying that we have been following even what is bad.
We should learn whatever is suitable for our use.
Even the good in capitalism should be learned.
We should adopt an attitude of equal treatment to all small nations abroad, we should not cock our tail.
Although we are not imperialists, do not have an “Octoberist Revolution,” and in the beginning cannot cock our tail; we shall soon learn a few things and shall soon be able to cock our tail.
We should teach our comrades who are sent to foreign countries to be honest and sincere and call a spade a spade; and we must let everyone see what is good, bad, or medi-ocre in us.
The Soviet Union had its Czars; and we have our Chiang Kai-shek.
If our country has small feet, and others want to photograph them, let them do it.
If our clothes are not good, let us not be afraid they will look unsightly.
If we tell lies in front of foreigners, someday these lies will surely be exposed.
As to the problem of communication, some things can be talked about anywhere.
The bad things about Stalin and the Third International can be communicated to the local committee secretaries and also to the county com-mittee secretaries.
It is out of consideration for the total situation that these are not written about in articles.
(This article had one sentence about “certain bad ideas being brought up,”) and we have no intention of discussing them in newspapers or among the masses.

Chairman Mao’s Talk to Music Workers August 24, 1956 The art of all the nations of the world is similar with respect to fundamental principles, but different with respect to form and style.
The art of the various socialist countries each has socialism as its content, but each has its own na-tional character.
They have both similarities and differences, common features and individual characteristics.
This is a natural law.
All things are like this, no matter whether they belong to nature, society, or to the realm of the intellect.
Take the leaves of a tree; at first sight they all look much the same, but when you examine them closely, each one is different; to find two absolutely identical leaves is impossible.
Class struggle, social revolution, the transition from capitalism to socialism have the same fundamental principles in all countries.
But when it comes to some of the minor principles and manifestations which are dependent on the major principles, then each country is different.
The October Revolution and the Chinese Revolution are like this.
With respect to fundamental principles the two revolutions are similar, but with respect to the form in which these principles were manifested, the two revolutions have many differences.
For example, in Russia the revolution developed from the cities to the countryside, while in our country it developed from the countryside to the cities.
This is one of the many differences between the two revolutions.
The art of the various nations of the world each has its own peculiar national form and national style.
Some people do not understand this point.
They reject their own national characteristics and blindly worship the West, thinking that the West is better in every respect.
They even go so far as to advocate ‘complete Westernization’.
This is wrong.
‘Complete Westernization’ is impracticable; it will not be accepted by the common people of China.
The arts and the natural sciences differ in this respect.
For example, removing the appendix and taking aspirin have no national form.
This is not the case with the arts: with them the question of national form does arise.
This is because art is the manifestation of people’s lives, thoughts and emotions, and it bears a very close relationship to a nation’s customs and language.
Historically the artistic heritage has grown up within the framework of the nation.
Chinese art, Chinese music, painting, drama, song and dance, and liter-ature have each had their own historical development.
In rejecting Chinese things, the people who advocate complete Westernization say that Chinese things do not have their own laws, and so they are unwilling to study or devel-op them.
This is adopting an attitude of national nihilism towards Chinese art.
Every nation in the world has its own history and its own strengths and weaknesses.
Since earliest times excellent things and rotten things have min-gled together and accumulated over long periods.
To sort them out and distin-guish the essence from the dregs is a very difficult task, but we must not reject history because of this difficulty.
It is no good cutting ourselves off from history and abandoning our heritage.
The common people would not approve.
Of course this by no means implies that we do not need to learn from for-eign countries.
We must learn many things from foreign countries and master them.
We must especially master fundamental theory.
Some people advocate ‘Chinese learning as the substance, Western learning for practical application’.
Is this idea right or wrong? It is wrong.
The word ‘learning’ in fact refers to fundamental theory.
Fundamental theory should be the same in China as in foreign countries.
There should be no distinction between Chinese and West-ern things in fundamental theory.
Marxism is a fundamental theory which was produced in the West.
How then can we make a distinction between what is Chinese and what is West-ern in this respect? Are we to refuse to accept Marxism? The practice of the Chinese revolution proves that not to accept Marxism would be bad for us.
It would be unreasonable not to accept it.
In the past the Second International attempted to deny and revise the fundamental theories of Marxism and put forward some arguments for this, but they were completely refuted by Lenin.
Marxism is a general truth which has universal application.
We must accept it.
But this general truth must be combined with the concrete practice of each nation’s revolution.
It was only because the Chinese people accepted Marxism and combined it with the practice of the Chinese revolution that they won victory in the Chinese revolution.
We learn foreign things because we want to study and develop Chinese things.
In this respect natural and social science are similar.
We must master all the good things from foreign countries and then apply them and, in the process, develop them.
In the field of natural science we must do our own independent creative work, and use modern scientific knowledge and methods from abroad to sort out China’s scientific heritage, until we can form our own schools of thought.
Take, for example, Western medical science and other re-lated modern sciences such as physiology, pathology, biochemistry, bacteriolo-gy and anatomy.
Can you say we do not want to study them? We must study all these modern sciences.
But some of those who have studied Western medicine should also study Chinese medicine and use their modern scientific knowledge and method to put in order and study our ancient Chinese medical methods and materials.
They should also combine Chinese and Western medicine and pharmacy to create new unified Chinese medical and pharmaceutical sciences.
If this applies to natural and social science, how much the more should it apply to the arts.
We must learn from foreign countries and absorb the good things from foreign countries, but when we have learned them we must use them to study and develop the arts of the various peoples of China, otherwise our work will benefit nobody.
Our aim in studying foreign arts, studying their fundamental theories and techniques, is to create a new socialist art of the various peoples of China, which will possess its own individual national forms and styles.
We must acknowledge that in respect of modern culture the standards of the west are higher than ours.
We have fallen behind.
Is this the case in respect of art? In art we have our strengths and also our weaknesses.
We must be good at absorbing the good things from foreign countries in order to make good our own shortcomings.
If we stick to our old ways and do not study foreign litera-ture, do not introduce it into China; if we do not know how to listen to foreign music or how to play it, this is not good.
We must not be like the Empress Dowager Cixi who blindly rejected all foreign things.
Blindly rejecting foreign things is like blindly worshipping them.
Both are incorrect and harmful.
In learning from foreign countries we must oppose both conservatism and dogmatism.
We have already suffered politically from dogmatism.
Everything we copied from abroad was adopted rigidly, and this ended in a great defeat, with the Party organizations in the white areas losing one hundred percent of their strength and the revolutionary bases and the Red Army losing ninety per-cent of their strength, and the victory of the revolution being delayed for many years.
The reason is that there were some comrades who did not take reality as their starting point but dogmatism.
They did not combine the fundamental theory of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revo-lution.
If we had not rejected this kind of dogmatism the Chinese revolution would not have won today’s victory.
In the field of the arts we should also learn this lesson and take good care not to let dogmatism get the better of us.
To study foreign things does notmean importing everything, lock, stock and barrel.
We must accept things critically.
We learn from the ancients in order to benefit the people of today, and we learn from foreigners in order to benefit the people of China.
We must learn good things from foreign countries and also learn good things from China.
Half bottles of vinegar are no good; we must change two half bottles into two whole bottles.
420 We must master both Chinese and For-eign things and combine them into an organic whole.
Lu Xun did this.
He was very well versed in both Chinese and foreign works, but his brilliance was not primarily in his translations but rather in his creative work.
His creative work was akin neither to foreign things nor to old-style Chinese things, but it is still Chinese.
We should study Lu Xun’s spirit, master both Chinese and foreign things, absorb the good points of Chinese and foreign art, fuse them together and create a new art with a characteristic national form and style.
Of course it is not easy to make a successful combination of Chinese and foreign things.
It is a process which takes time.
There are some Chinese things into which it is possible to blend foreign things.
For example, in writing nov-els, the language, characters and background must be Chinese, but they need not be written in the Chinese ‘instalment’421 form.
You can produce some things which are neither Chinese nor Western.
If what comes out is neither a donkey nor a horse but a mule, that would be not bad at all.
When two things combine, their form is changed.
It is not possible for them to remain completely unchanged.
Chinese things will change.
Politically, economically and culturally, the face of China is undergoing big changes.
But however much they change, Chinese things will always have their own characteristics.
Foreign things also change.
After the October Revolution the face of the world under-went a fundamental change.
After the Second World War this change devel-oped in a new direction.
We must give our attention to the critical acceptance of foreign things, and especially to the introduction of things from the socialist world and from the progressive people of the capitalist world.
In short, art must have independent creative qualities; it must be distinctly imbued with the character of the times and also with the national character.
China’s art must not look more and more to the past, nor must it become more and more Westernized.
It must increasingly reflect the characteristics of the times and the nation.
In trying to achieve this we should show experimen-tation.
Especially in a country such as China, with a long history and a large 420.
A Chinese proverb ‘A half bottle of vinegar shakes, a full bottle does not’.
421.
Traditional Chinese novels grew out of the story tellers art, and are told in installments form.
population, it is even more necessary to carry out such experimentation as will serve the needs of the various nationalities the better.
We do not want complete uniformity.
Uniformity leads to writing to formulae.
No matter whether they are foreign or local formulate both are lifeless and are not welcomed by the common people of China.
We have here the question of the treatment of bourgeois intellectuals who have received a Western education.
If we do not tackle this question properly, it will have an adverse effect not only on art, but also on the whole revolution-ary cause.
The Chinese national bourgeoisie and its intellectuals consist of a few million people.
Although their numbers are not great, they possess mod-ern culture.
We must unite with them, educate them and remould them.
The comprador class has its own culture, which is a slave culture.
The landlord class also has its culture—feudal culture.
The Chinese workers and peasants, owing to their having been oppressed for a long time, still do not have much cultural knowledge.
Until the tasks of the cultural and technical revolutions have been completed the bourgeois intellectuals have comparatively more knowledge and skill.
Provided our policy is correct and we educate and remould them, we can get them to serve the cause of socialism.
Can we educate and remould them? We can.
Many of the people here present were bourgeois intellectuals in the past who have crossed over from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat, so why should not they too cross over? In fact there are already many who have crossed over.
We must not fail to unite with them, educate them and remould them.
Only if we do this will they be of benefit to the revolutionary cause of the working class, to the socialist revolution, and to socialist construction.
You who are here present are all musicians.
In studying western music you have many important responsibilities.
The ordering and development of Chi-nese music must depend on you who study Western-style music, just as the ordering and development of Chinese medicine depends on Western-style doctors.
The Western things which you study are useful, but you should mas-ter both western and Chinese things, and should not ‘completely westernize’.
You should devote attention to Chinese things, do your utmost to study and develop them, with the aim of creating our own Chinese things with charac-teristic national form and style.
If you grasp this basic policy your work will have a great future.

Instructions at a Discussion Meeting Attended by some of the Delegates to the Second Session of the First Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce December 8, 1956 I am a layman in economics and therefore I shall give a laymen’s talk.
You have raised many questions which are very helpful to me.
I heard quite a few within the limited time.
Yesterday I had a meeting with the chairman and the vice-chairman at which I heard a number of things and began to understand certain general conditions.
As to details, you should hold a meeting to discuss them.
Chen Yun and XXX, vice premiers of the State Council, will make a re-port to you.
The government would like to discuss with you ways to solve your problems.
All solvable problems will have to be solved.
Some of the problems I haven’t studied and therefore I cannot offer any solutions.
The government will make a study of the problems that you have brought up and Vice Premier Chen Yun will consider ways to solve those solvable problems.
Since the inauguration of public-private joint enterprises,422 great progress has been achieved by industrial and commercial circles.
We feel we have come to know you better and to be closer with you.
Subsequent to the inauguration of public-private joint enterprises, the only problem of the capitalists is that of fixed interests.
423 Their reputation in society has changed, and they have shown great enthusiasm in learning politics, current events, skills and methods of ad-ministration.
I was told that training classes have been inaugurated at all places with several hundred people joining in each city.
In Shanghai several thousand people take part in one session.
In 10 sessions there will be tens of thousands 422.
Public-private joint enterprises were established as per article 31 of the Common Pro-gramme of the CPPCC.
The article 31 stipulates: “Enterprises jointly operated by state and private capital are enterprises of a state-capitalist character.
Whenever necessary and fea-sible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism by such means as undertaking processing work for state enterprises, operating enterprises jointly with the state, or, in the form of concessions, operating stale enterprises and exploit-ing national resources, etc.
” 423.
The payment of a fixed rate of interest was a means employed by the state in the course of Socialist transformation to implement its policy of redemption with regard to the national bourgeoisie’s means of production.
After the conversion of capitalist industry and commerce into joint state-private enterprises by whole trades in 1956, the state paid the national bourgeoisie a fixed annual rate of interest on the money value of their assets for a given period of time.
In its nature this interest was still a form of exploitation.
of participants.
This is a manifestation of great patriotism and the fervent spirit of learning of the industrial and commercial circles.
They are anxious to work for a new state, to study economics, and to acquire skills.
All members, large, medium or small, are willing to learn.
My classification of capitalists in three categories—large, medium and small—shows the improvement of my understanding of them.
Previously, I thought it would be very difficult to reform them.
Even you yourselves had not expected that you would have reformed so quickly and that the tide of learning would be so high.
Are you going to develop self-criticism? (Answer: “We will.
”) At last year’s conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Com-merce many made a self-examination.
This is a technique of the Communist Party.
We have thought of promoting this technique among democratic parties but as yet without too much success.
This technique was recently employed at the conference of the China Democratic National Construction Association, developing criticism and sell-criticism.
This is a technique for the people to solve their internal problems—advancing opinions, presenting demands, solv-ing problems, and achieving unity.
We have undergone two revolutions.
The democratic revolution of the bourgeoisie is over and presents no more problem.
Now the socialist revolution has been essentially accomplished, but not yet fully accomplished, for many problems remain unsolved such as agricultural cooperativization, handicraft cooperativization and public-private joint enterprise.
Even when the whole reform program has been completed, there will still be many problems, endless problems.
What are said to be problems are contradictions, disharmony, and disequilibrium.
Problems of livelihood and employment, as well as domes-tic and foreign problems are full of contradictions.
Somebody has said: Why should there have been a Beria in Russia? Even Stalin himself made mistakes.
In China there was Gao Gang.
Even Hong Kong was engulfed in turmoil.
There were problems of Poland, Hungary424 and the Suez Canal.
The world is full of problems.
The problems that we brought up today are of one type: they are the problems of the industrial and commercial circles and of the large, medium and small components of these circles.
Let me now talk about current events.
Do you think that socialism will succeed? Do you have doubts about its suc-cess? Do you fear that the socialist camp will collapse? In my opinion, even if 424.
This refers to the riot that occurred in Poznan, Poland, in June 1956 and to the count-er-revolutionary rebellion that took place in Hungary in October of the same year.
it should collapse, there will be no big danger.
But I don’t think it will collapse, not at all.
The principal components of the socialist camp are the Soviet Union and China.
China and the Soviet Union stand together.
This is a right policy.
But there are still people who have doubt about this policy.
They say, “Don’t stand together”.
They think that China should take a middle course and be a bridge between the Soviet Union and the US.
This is the Yugoslav way, a way to get money from both sides.
Is this a good way? I don’t think it is good at all, for it does no good to the nation.
For on one side is powerful imperialism un-der whose oppression China had been for a long time.
If China stands between the Soviet Union and the US, she appears to be in a favorable position and to be independent, but actually she is not.
The US is not dependable.
She would give you something but not much.
How could we expect imperialism to give us a full meal? It won’t.
Imperialism has been oppressive to Asia, Africa and Latin America.
India has suffered oppression for more than 200 years.
She has never been given a full meal.
Imperialism is stingy.
The imperialist powers are such nations as Britain, the US, France, and the Netherlands.
It was the eight powers whose allied expeditionary forces burned down the Summer Palace.
425 It was also the imperialist powers that seized Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Hong Kong is Chinese territory.
Why should it have been ceded to Britain?426 Why was the Bandung Conference able to unify the Afro-Asian countries? Because these countries had been under the oppression of imperialism which, in this case, was the US Latin Americans who came to visit China were very friendly 425.
In 1900 eight imperialist powers, Britain, France, Japan, tsarist Russia, Germany, the United States, Italy and Austria, sent a joint force to attack China in an attempt to sup-press the Yihetuan Uprising of the Chinese people against aggression.
The Chinese people resisted heroically.
The allied forces of the eight powers captured Dagu and occupied Tian-jin and Beijing.
In 1901 the Ching government concluded a treaty with the eight imperial-ist countries; its main provisions were that China had to pay those countries the enormous sum of 450 million taels of silver as war reparations and grant them the special privilege of stationing troops in Beijing and in the area from Beijing to Tianjin to Shanhaiguan.
426.
For many decades, beginning with the end of the 19th century, Britain exported an increasing quantity of opium to China.
This traffic not only subjected the Chinese people to drugging but also plundered China of her silver.
It aroused fierce opposition in China.
In 1840, under the pretext of safeguarding its trade with China, Britain launched armed aggression against her.
The Chinese troops led by Lin Tse-hsu put up resistance, and the people in Guangzhou spontaneously organized the Ping Ying Tuan (Quell-the-British Corps), which dealt serious blows to the British forces of aggression.
In 1812, however, the corrupt Ching regime signed the Treaty of Nanking with Britain.
This treaty provided for the payment of indemnities and the cession of Hong Kong to Britain, and stipulated that Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo and Guangzhou were to be opened to British trade and that tariff rates for British goods imported into China were to be jointly fixed by China and Britain.
to us.
Just today I received a Brazilian representative.
Brazil is a large country with a population of 60 million and an area as large as China’s.
It has been under the oppression of US imperialism all these years.
Illusions of serving as a bridge between the Soviet Union and the US and Britain for profit — this kind of thinking is wrong.
We do not know how to design a big plant.
Who would do it for us? Who would design large plants for us —such as chemical industry, steel industry, petroleum industry, tanks, airplanes and manufacture of automobiles? Britain had never designed these for India.
Recently, because the Soviet Union designed a steel and iron works for India, Britain and the US each followed up with designing one, too, just to try to win her over.
India’s first alkali plant was designed by a Chinese engineer Hou Debang.
Imperialism wants to keep its technology secret.
No imperialism has ever designed anything for us.
Democratic parties, democratic personages with no party affiliations, high-class intellectuals, religious circles, industrial and commercial circles and certain proletarians still have the illusion that the US and Britain would help us.
We should launch a propaganda campaign on the rationale of leaning to one side.
When we lean to one side, we are with the Soviet Union and on equal footing with her.
We won’t encounter problems such as those Poland and Hungary have faced.
We are followers of Marxism, but we do not blindly copy Soviet experience.
To do so would be a mistake.
Our industrial and com-mercial transformation and agricultural cooperativization differ with the Sovi-ets’.
In the several years after agricultural cooperativization, their production decreased, but our production has increased.
We have reformed all capitalist industrialists and businessmen, eliminating them as a class and taking them all into our fold as individuals.
Industry and commerce are not a burden to the state but rather a source of wealth.
In the past they have been a positive force.
Economically, they have been modernized; they are no longer in the handicraft stage.
Politically, they are against imperialism.
Therefore, they have two-sid-edness, one of which is its revolutionary character.
Since the establishment of the people’s government, they have cooperated with it and all enterprises have been put under public-private joint operation.
For these things we cannot say that the bourgeoisie is useless to us; it is useful, very useful.
The workers do not understand this because, in the past, they have had conflicts with the capitalists in the factory.
We should therefore explain the situation to the workers.
Espe-cially since the high tide of learning of the industrial and commercial circles and in view of your desire for learning, the workers would change their altitude toward you.
Our propaganda aimed at the capitalist should stress the impor-tance of linking individual interests with state interests, promoting patriotism,and, in short, keeping in mind the state.
In the cooperativization movement in Hebei province the former slogan was “If you want to develop your home, plant cotton.
” The result was that people only took care of their homes.
The slogan was defective and has since been changed to: “If you love your country and want to develop your home, plant more cotton,” thereby linking the home with the country.
You should now link up your home and your country to which you belong.
Our country is poor, very poor.
This year steel production amounts to only 4.
5 million tons.
Not until next year will there be 5 million tons.
Japan’s production is 7 million tons.
If we want to catch up with Japan, we will have to wait until the third five-year plan before reaching a production of 10 million tons.
The main point of discussion of this meeting concerns your own affairs, but they should be linked with state affairs.
When you return to your own town, your propaganda on education should also be linked with state affairs.
It will take decades and even centuries for us to produce tens of millions or hundreds of millions of tons of steel.
We should stimulate patriotism.
Why must we promote public-private joint enterprises? Why must we promote socialism? Because we want to develop our country, to develop a national economy and a culture better than the system of private ownership and to ensure national independence.
Economically, we are still not independent.
We cannot manu-facture big machines or precision instruments.
We can manufacture only me-dium-sized machines.
We have just begun manufacturing airplanes and auto-mobiles.
Which country made the designs for us? It was the Soviet Union.
We should cooperate with the Soviet Union.
In our country there is no anti-Soviet movement as in Poland and Hungary; nor in industrial and commercial circles or among college students.
About 70 percent of our college students are the sons and daughters of the bourgeoisie and the landlords.
We need to rally and educate them.
Since they are your sons and daughters, solving your problems will also benefit them.
The Youth League wishes to solve their problems of enrolling in schools, joining the League, getting stipends, and wearing the red scarf.
Stipends should be given on the basis of scholastic achievements and family conditions.
They should not be given to those from big families, but from middle, small and poor families.
Joining the League and the Party should also be on this basis.
These conditions can be fully carried out in China.
Colors and thoughts are not uniform.
There is always two-sidedness—progressiveness and backwardness.
This is a fact.
One’s duty is to learn.
If everything were good, then everybody would be Confucius.
If everybody in the street was a sage, would Chiang Kai-shek and Hitler, who had also been in the street, besages too? Would aggressors against Egypt and secret agents be sages also? Men are different from each other.
If we say that all capitalists are patriotic, the state-ment is untrue.
There are positive and negative elements.
To differentiate them is to learn.
Otherwise one doesn’t need to learn and can automatically become a sage.
Jiang Yuwei said that before he was 30 he could write a well-developed essay.
After 30, his power of learning was developed to the highest point.
It was not without reason that he later played a leading role in the restoration movement.
One should not feel satisfied with one’s knowledge.
Even when one is 70 or 80, there is much that one doesn’t know.
We should make a greater effort to learn, for there are still many things we don’t know.
Uncle Chen, you are a Hanlin [holder of a literary degree in the old system].
You know astron-omy, geography, all the ancient philosophers, the three religions and the nine schools of thought.
427 Are you really well-versed in all these fields? You are a Hanlin.
I am nobody.
I don’t even have a degree.
I know very little.
To admit one’s shortcomings has its merits.
Among you are holders of second and third [advanced] degrees who will be given the task of aiding others in study.
Was the Hungarian incident good or bad? Problems should be exposed.
It is good to expose them.
A pustule will burst and emit pus.
Those countries that imitated the Soviet pattern and failed to face up to reality have not been do-ing well and, in fact, have gone wrong.
Herein we learn a lesson.
What we do should be based upon the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and should be in accordance with the reality of China.
We have brought up the slogan “Learn from Soviet experience,” but never have we proposed to learn from the Rus-sians’ backward experience.
Do they have any backward experience? Yes, they do.
For instance, their suppression of counterrevolutionaries is carried out by public security organs.
In China it is carried out by organizations and schools under the direction of local party committees, not by public security organs.
We do it under total mobilization and in full array but the Russians do it mys-teriously.
Democratic parties do it themselves.
Are there some persons who are afraid of suppressing the counterrevolutionaries? Are they afraid that the move might affect themselves? You have your hardships; the workers have theirs.
The government will listen to the views of both sides, you have problems of employment; so do the workers.
Your unemployment problem has not been 427.
In ancient China, the three religions were Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism and the nine schools of thought were the Confucians, the Taoists, the Yin-Yang, the Legalists, the Logicians, the Mohists, the Political Strategists, the Eclectics and the Agriculturists.
Later the “three religions and nine schools of thought” took on a broader meaning to indi-cate the different religious sects and academic schools.
In the old society the phrase was also used to mean people in dubious trades.
solved; nor has the workers’.
The Hungarian incident shows that underground counterrevolutionaries had established a counterrevolutionary command and started plotting rebellion several months ago in collusion with foreign powers.
The situation in China is different.
Counterrevolutionaries have been largely liquidated.
They have also been liquidated from industrial and commercial cir-cles.
Only a few individuals remain.
We can absolve those who connived and dealt with the Kuomintang in the past, especially prominent men who were compelled by circumstances Io cooperate with them.
Even our party cooperat-ed with the Kuomintang at one time I was a member of the legislature in the capacity of a distinguished personage of society.
I went to Chongqing to attend meetings.
In the past I participated in the Kuomintang and the San Min Chu I Youth Corps.
428 I mention this fact but no importance need be attached to it.
Some counterrevolutionaries are active right now.
If anyone is now a transgres-sor, then we should not let him go, no matter to which class he belongs.
I think the number is small.
Today industrial and commercial circles are purer than before.
Unlike their old selves, they have far fewer counterrevolutionaries.
We can set our minds at case.
The few individuals are exceptions.
No Hungarian incident would happen in our country.
Since the Pan Hannian and Hu Feng affairs of last year to the present, over 4 million people have been investigated.
Of 160,000 suspects, only 38,000 were counterrevolutionaries, or 1.
2 percent.
The previous estimate of 5 percent was inaccurate because it was based on subjective observation, not objective fact.
Actually, there is only 1.
1 percent in organizations and schools and the percentage in society is even smaller.
If these germs are not eliminated, they will multiply to tens of thousands and will cause disturbance from within.
Eliminating them is an education for the broad mass-es.
The remaining 120,000 suspects were declared innocent.
We apologize to them for having accused them wrongly.
Those 38,000 counterrevolutionaries will not be killed.
About 1 percent will be reformed through labor while the rest will remain in their original positions.
This year we are planning to clean up.

persons, using far better methods.
There are about 4 million people who 428.
In 1923 Sun Yat-sen, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, decided to reorganize the Kuomintang, bring about Kuomintang-Communist co-operation and admit members of the Communist Party into the Kuomintang.
In January 1924, he convened in Guangzhou the Kuomintang’s First National Congress at which he laid down the Three Great Policies—alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and assis-tance to the peasants and workers.
Mao Zedong, Li Dazhao, Lin Bozhu, Qu Qiubai and other comrades attended the Congress and played an important part in helping the Kuo-mintang to take the road of revolution.
Some of these comrades were elected members, and others alternate members, of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.
need to go through this process.
Major factories and private enterprises will not be included so that they won’t be distributed for the present.
Later on, when they are subject to being cleaned up, we shall need your participation.
The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the urban Communist Party organizations will all have to take part in this cleaning up.
It will still be directed at individ-uals—the genuine counterrevolutionaries, not those who had associated with the Kuomintang, or had joined the Kuomintang or the San Min Chu I Youth Corps, nor those who first did bad things but later did good things.
My talk today is on political problems.
You are concerned with economic problems.
You may not be too interested in my talk.
To sum up, China’s position vis-à-vis foreign powers is good.
The Hungarian incident has been basically settled, though there may be further disturbance in the world.
Don’t feel upset because of Gao Gang, Beria, Stalin’s mistakes, or the Hungarian incident.
Sleep at ease.
On 19 October many people in Hong Kong could not sleep.
But after a few days they were able to sleep again.
If you think the government has not given you enough help, you may bring this up.
The government can give you more help.
By now you should know well the characteristics of the government.
We are the same group.
We consult the people, the workers, the peasants, the cap-italists, the petty bourgeoisie, and the democratic parties on whatever we plan to do.
You can call us the consulting government.
We do not put on a stern face and lecture people.
We do not give anyone a stunning blow if his opinions are not sound.
We are called the people’s government.
You may bring up whatever ideas you have.
We don’t ill-treat people under any pretext.
You are concerned about how to solve the problems of the large, medium and small enterprises and the problem of fixed interest.
The large, medium and small ones should be separated into different levels.
I have some suggestions to make in this regard and wish you to think them over to see whether they are feasible.
The small ones, which represent 80-90 percent of the total, should not be included in the bourgeois group, but should be called upper-level petty bourgeoisie.
This was done before.
For example, a doctor with 2 or 3 appren-tices was considered a petty bourgeois, fishermen and boatmen employing 10-odd persons were also not classified as bourgeois.
During land reform, some owners of small plots of land for lease were not called landlords.
This benefited several tens of thousands of people who were very interested in their title.
Cap-italists’ agents and those drawing low interests who do not want to participate and who want to remain the same may be excluded for the next 2 years.
This delay will make it possible for 90 percent of the people to continue to receivetheir fixed interest, while only 10 percent of the people will suffer a loss.
The remaining ones are the large ones.
According to economics and the American system, more than 30 persons constitute a big plant.
Those with less than 20 or 15 persons may give up [their fixed interest] if they wish; those who do not want to may continue to receive it.
All of you are very much concerned about the duration of the fixed interests.
The basic principle is to solve problems, not to damage the benefits of enterprises; particularly those of the large ones.
Do the large ones or small ones play a more important role in the national econ-omy and the people’s livelihood? The small ones represent more people, 90 percent of the total.
But their economy has no decisive effect upon the nation’s economic life.
The greater effect upon the national economy still comes from the large organizations.
You say that the Chairman takes special care of the big capitalists but not the small capitalists.
Is this right opportunism? You should analyze the situation to see if it is right to take special care of the small orga-nizations.
The small organizations have more people.
It is wrong not to plan for them and solve their various problems.
But the large organization has its claim for its size.
A large one can match several tens of thousands of small ones.
For the capitalists, our party has established certain lines, such as the United Front Department.
For the medium and small organizations these lines are not correctly drawn.
The medium and small ones should of course be taken care of.
We now put them in the petty bourgeois groups to solve their problems ac-cordingly.
The peasants are the petty bourgeoisie of the villages.
There are also petty bourgeoisie in cities.
Those who receive fixed interests worth only several packages of cigarettes are petty bourgeoisie.
Capitalists agents are also classified in that category.
The importance to the state of the large public-private joint enterprises and their nationalization is great.
Without industry we cannot live and without agriculture we won’t have food.
If we do not take care of the large capitalists, 90 percent of them will break away.
The few left behind will present a sordid sight.
When all others are red, the few white will feel ill at ease.
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has discussed the duration of fixed interests.
It felt that the duration should not be too short.
Redemption should be true redemption without deception.
Actually not much money is involved in payment.
Some people ask how many more years will go by before the redemption.
In the documents of the Eighth Party Congress the subject is broached but we still want to consult you on whether this problem can be solved.
The small enterprises and the workers will object.
The workers will say we are making it too advantageous for the capitalists.
In their opinion they should be canceled immediately.
For the medium and small enterprisesthis can be done in one or two years.
Why should it take so long? There are two oppositions.
The first is the workers.
The second is that 90 percent of the me-dium and small enterprises are envious of the comfortable life of the large ones.
We have to convince these people that redemption should be carried out thor-oughly, not half redemption and half confiscation.
The Chinese national bour-geoisie has two sides, one of which is revolutionary.
Its actual capital is not big.
Private industrial shares total 1.
7 billion yuan equivalent to less than US $7 billion.
With this small capital how could China not be put at a disadvantage? Imperialism has taken advantage of us not without reason.
In view of this small national capital we should redeem it fully.
We need not save this money.
We should convince the workers that we should not do anything detrimental to the interests of the large capitalists for they are beneficial to the state.
We should not save this small amount of money but carry through the project of redemp-tion with fervency.
If necessary, we can prolong it to the third five-year plan.
What do you think of a little prolongation? If it can be completed in seven years, that will be fine.
But if it cannot, we can prolong it to the third five-year plan so long as this is feasible.
We should help the medium and small enterpris-es solve their problems because their number is larger.
The number of large capitalists is small, but their capital is larger, much larger than that of the me-dium and small enterprises.
For this reason the medium and small line is wrong.
It should be a large, medium and small line.
The people’s reconstruc-tion is a large line.
It is right to use the large as a basis.
At the conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce delegates of medium and small enterprises form the majority.
We should help them to solve problems and at the same time enjoin them not to do anything detrimental to the inter-ests of the large enterprises, because the latter plays a great role in the national economy.
Any detriment to their interests would not be good for workers, peasants, the state and the medium and small enterprises.
The medium and small enterprises wish to dispose of their interests as soon as possible, whereas the large enterprises wish to hold on to them as long as possible.
You may do what ever you like to dispose of your interests as early as you like.
The highest value of any enterprise in the first seven years.
If the medium and small want to reclaim them, they can.
Would this be satisfactory? No law has yet been enacted.
We can consult on what we should do.
If, after seven years, we still find no solution, we can postpone settlement a little longer.
We should first take care of the interests of the workers.
There are 1.
6 million workers in capi-talist industries and 900,000 employees in capitalist businesses, totaling 2.
5 million persons.
Workers and employees in state enterprises will also be in-volved.
All of them will be opposed to what we plan to do for the capitalists.
On this problem they are in contradiction with the party.
Are we falling into right opportunism? Are we becoming a capitalist party? We have to explain to them that what we are doing is beneficial to the entire nation, to the workers, the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the medium and small enterprises.
They may not understand what “beneficial” is at the moment.
Among college students 70 percent are the sons and daughters of the bourgeoisie.
These stu-dents don’t want any inheritance, but they will be satisfied with how the gov-ernment is treating the capitalists.
Members of democratic parties, democratic personages with no party affiliations, leaders of the upper level of minorities, and religious circles will agree with us.
But they won’t agree to an early cancel-lation of fixed interests.
Then there are foreigners visiting China who always go to Shanghai to see Mr.
Rong Yiren and to see how many automobiles he owns, one or two, and whether there is a piano in his house.
After seeing him, a French capitalist said that if the French communists did the same to the capi-talists he would feel satisfied.
The effect upon Afro-Asian and West European countries would be great too.
Therefore, it will do no good but harm if we abolish fixed interests at an early date.
Actually not much money is involved in paying interests—in one year, only 125 million yuan and some people say, 110 million yuan, totaling 800 million yuan in seven years.
This money is not given to Japanese or Americans but to Chinese.
“The fertile water is not flowing into other people’s fields.
” “A horse of Ch’u is caught by a man of Ch’u.
” This mon-ey represents the state’s purchasing power.
It also redeems state bonds.
It may also be used to run factories.
It is worth spending from all considerations.
Among the delegates at this conference those from medium and small enter-prises form the majority.
You can do the job of explaining.
You who are from medium and small enterprises should bear the responsibility of explaining to your people.
The delegates from large enterprises cannot very well do this.
When they try to name some advantages, they cannot very well say for in-stance, that the duration of fixed interests should be seven years.
We need Vice Premiers XXX, XXX and delegates from medium and small enterprises to go and explain whether the Communist Party is going to abolish the fixed inter-ests for large enterprises.
Mr.
Rong Yiren’s capital is worth half of Beijing.
All eyes are turned on him.
Of more than 10,000 capitalists in the country there are probably only several thousand large ones.
We should watch them rather than the 120,000 medium and small ones.
It is easy for us to handle the large ones.
We need only launch a campaign against them with much sound and fury.
Handling the medium and small enterprises needs even less effort, noth-ing to be published in the press—once anything is published in the press, they surrender—and no campaign to be launched.
Any report on this conference needs to say only that delegates and group leaders of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and China Democratic National Construction As-sociation participated and that I had analyzed domestic and foreign politics and also discussed the economic problem.
But the report need not go into the details of my talk.
Should the details be divulged, the workers and those of medium and small enterprises would rebuke us.
They would say that commu-nists are after all communists; why should they not communize property? Peo-ple allege that communists have three heads and six arms and are very fierce.
But actually we have only one head and two arms.
What we do is “in accor-dance with heavenly principles, human relationships, the world’s trends and the people’s needs.
Men with foresight and vision who act resolutely cannot help but succeed.
” This is what Dr Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary leader, said.
Our two revolutions are a continuation of the work bequeathed by Dr.
Sun—consummation of the democratic revolution of the bourgeoisie and completion of the socialist revolution.
These two revolutions paved the way for national construction.
They were a means to an end.
They aimed at changing production relationship and the superstructure—the government, ideology, laws, politics, economics, culture, and the arts.
But the basic problem has not yet been solved.
The objective is not to establish a new government and a new production relationship but to develop production.
During the past 7 years production has been developed but to a very limited extent.
In spite of our boast, our production of steel this year is only 4 million tons.
Next year it is estimated at only X million tons, and 5 years after, only some 10 million tons.
With a population of more than 600 million, China can easily surpass Japan and France in production.
But it will take at least 40-50 years for China to catch up with the U.
S.
in steel production.
May I ask you to turn your atten-tion to this matter.
Comrade Chen Yun met a Swedish friend who told him that Sweden has a population of only several million but every person has an average of two tons of steel.
Their total population has therefore several hun-dred million tons of steel.
The U.
S.
has only 100 million tons of steel.
To reach Sweden’s output the U.
S.
has to increase its steel production several times.
That’s why the U.
S.
underwent a democratic revolution429 and is now engaged in a socialist revolution.
When the All-China Federation of Industry and Com-429.
A reference to the bourgeois revolution of 1775-83, known as the War of Indepen-dence in which the people of North America opposed British colonial rule.
merce and the China Democratic National Construction Association hold meetings, what do they study? None other than how to reach these goals of several hundred million tons of steel and also opening more schools installed with radio receivers.
The people all over the country should at least be gradu-ates of junior middle schools.
In a few more years street scavengers, cooks and all other persons would be college graduates who would know astronomy and geography.
All work aims at this goal.
Chiang Kai-shek deserves a sound beat-ing because he had not done a single good thing.
In 20 years he had produced only 50,000 tons of steel.
In eight years (including next year) we will have produced 5 million tons of steel.
Chiang’s mind was not on his work.
I hope you will lead these 10 million and more people in the direction of production.
With several decades of work, we can reform ourselves culturally.
Therefore, we should unite all who can be united.
In January of this year, at a conference of the State Council, I said that it would probably take about three more years for us to basically complete the socialist revolution.
This statement caused considerable reaction.
Some people asked whether it could really be so quick.
I used such modifiers as “probably,” “basically,” and “about.
” What is “basically”? It means that in public-private joint enterprises, interests have not yet been cancelled.
I think it is wise to fix a longer period so that we can complete the project ahead of schedule.
Nobody had expected that public-private joint management could have been carried out so soon.
But nationalization is not being enforced as hastily.
If it is hastily carried out, it won’t do any good to the state or the nation.
We need not spend much money and we keep our promise.
Our action will affect foreign capital-ism.
It would help inform the world’s capitalists.
Nehru, Sukarno, U Nu, and the French capitalist Pathe Co.
are all watching us, watching Rong Yiren.
.
.
The present situation and that which I talked about last spring are the same.
I talk only about “basic” completion by which I mean public-private joint enterpris-es.
Total completion will take seven years.
Excluding the current year there are six more years to go.
We have to take care of all parties concerned.
We should explain the situation clearly to the bourgeoisie, democratic personages without party affiliations, the enterprises, handicraftsmen, organizations, schools, and all workers.
Lack of understanding of the situation will do no good at all.

1957Interjections at Conference of Provincial and Municipal Committee Secretaries (Collected)430 January 1957 1.
The problem of Ideological Struggle Since the latter part of last year, there has been a trend toward right op-portunism, and there has been a counter-current of anti-socialism within and without the party.
The bad social customs must be eradicated.
Eradication requires persua-sive power.
A few reproachful remarks and rudeness would make the situation worse.
At the National People’s Congress in May and the People’s Consultative Conference in June there will be many strange arguments.
Problems involved include law codification, the plight of the peasants, and shortage of meat.
The crucial point is whether socialism has its superiority.
All delegates at these two conferences should participate in the debate.
Everyone of them should prepare an analytical statement.
The ideological struggle with the petty bourgeoisie and the rich middle peasants will have to continue for several years.
The rich middle peasants are very influential and powerful.
We should take note of this fact.
If we attend only to administrative work and overlook ideological work, there is bound to be trouble.
Every province needs one or two Marxists or Lu Xuns.
431 You ought to write articles.
All of you who are below 60 should write.
Every province should train theorists.
We are training actors and actresses and painters but not theorists.
This is a deficiency of the system.
You rely upon the central government but the central government has never prohibited you from doing anything on your own.

Lu Xun (1881-1936) was the father of modern Chinese literature and the greatest and most militant standard-bearer of China’s cultural revolution.
Apart from The True Story of Ah Q, A Madman’s Diary and The New Year’s Sacrifice—his most famous works—he wrote many short stories and essays, in which he vehemently attacks feudalism and imperialism, gives force to the aspirations of the oppressed and exposes the people’s enemy in his true colours.
He always identified his work with the Chinese people’s revolution, for which he waged a relentless struggle until his death in October 1936.
2.
The Problem of Trouble-Making Should we be afraid of trouble-making? I think we should not.
Whatever amount of trouble there may be should not scare us.
There is trouble every year and there will be more trouble in the years to come.
What’s the use of being afraid? Only by exposing contradictions can problems be solved.
Society is a unity of opposites.
Professors and students always have contradictions and disputes with us.
After 20 years when the old have died, the new will still have problems.
Forty years after the Soviet Revolution there is still trouble.
In fac-tories about 30 percent of the workers were formerly landlords, rich peasants and capitalists.
At universities about 80 percent of the students come from the families of landlords, rich peasants and capitalists.
We are not afraid of their creating trouble, even coming to Beijing to create trouble.
We should take positive, not negative, attitude toward them.
When Gero returned to Budapest from Yugoslavia, he reprimanded the masses.
He lost his prestige and dignity and was driven off the platform.
If you are prepared for any major untoward incident, probably none will happen.
If anything should happen, take a posi-tive attitude and correct measures to win over or split up the audience.
Capable men would create a situation out of the turmoil in Poznan and Hungary.
We wish a peaceful world but we must put ourselves in the worst position and be prepared for major disasters.
We came from Yanan and must be pre-pared to return there.
We had not seen Mei Lanfang in the past, but during the last seven years we have seen him off and on.
In the eighth year we should be prepared to return to Yanan because of the atomic bomb, a possible world war, blunders committed and the Hungarian incident.
If in our thinking we are prepared for the worst, we need not have fear.
If we are unprepared, we are bound to regret it.
The Seventh National Party Congress proposed a 17th arti-cle on “a thousand li of wasteland.
” With a population of 600 million, China need not be afraid of any untoward incident.
It is going to rain.
Mother wants to get married again.
Such happenings are inevitable.
Labor strikes, student strikes, petitions.
.
.
Some are provided for in the con-stitution while others are not prohibited.
While we should not encourage these activities, we should let them take place, whether the demands are rational or not.
If the demands are rational, we should take remedial measures.
If they are not rational, then we should explain.
If professors want to air their views, let them do so.
Exposing contradictions may lead to settlement of problems;they should not be suppressed.
But if we tolerate contradictions, we shall be vanquished.
The petty bourgeoisie want to establish a dictatorship.
It attempts to over-throw you so that it can set up its dictatorship.
Any attempt to seize Hungary needs a full ten or 20 years.
Mass meetings, lecture meetings and debating meetings are to be held in various provinces.
Wide discussion is to be held to see who is to emerge victorious.
However, preparations must be made before-hand.
At small meetings your opponents will speak and act arrogantly, but they may be cowed at big rallies.
If they want a major debate in the democratic way, let them have it.
Let them say all they want to.
If they don’t, it won’t do you any good.
If they do, you can judge whether they are right or wrong.
When society disintegrates, we should try to win people to our side.
If the people think they are wrong, then they are isolated.
Don’t fear trouble-making.
The bigger and longer the trouble-making, the better.
A series of trouble-making occurrences will bring results—bring out right and wrong.
However serious trouble-making may be, don’t be afraid.
The more you are afraid, the more the demons will be after you.
At the same time, don’t panic.
It is no good to panic at any lime.
Nationwide trouble is not likely to occur.
Wherever there are boils or germs, there will be bursts.
In a big province there may be 50,000 troubles a year, in a medium-size province 30,000 and in a small province 10,000.
Be prepared for trouble-making and make a reckoning at the end of the year.
If the figures given above are not reached, the work must be considered to have been done fairly well.
Secretaries of district and county committees should hold meetings to dis-cuss and make preparations for trouble-making.
County secretaries and chiefs and others in higher positions should be mentally prepared.
Should there be peace all the time and we grow passive and timid, once trouble starts, we would be put in a passive position.
Our thinking would be paralyzed and then we would have to accede to all demands.
Without fighting, many problems cannot be solved.
Contradictions can be settled only through struggle.
The Mohammedans at one place were put under restrictions regarding the slaughter of cattle.
They roughed up the cadres and the problem was solved.
Some clashes are rational while others are irrational.
Even irrational moves are good.
Grievances should be aired.
How should we dispose of renegades? Should we dismiss them summarily? Personally I feel we should not dismiss them in a hurry nor should we killthem (except counterrevolutionary criminals).
We should utilize their labor, use them for political instruction, and deprive them of their political capital.
A simple way of disposal is to refuse to accept them as ideological rivals.
Regarding people like Xiao Zhun and Ting Ling, execution, imprisonment or control would be ineffective.
What we should do is to find their faults and disgrace them in society.
Party members who make trouble in schools should be subject to thorough criticism and then expelled from the party.
We should not hurriedly expel them from the party or the school.
The survey of the components of the workers in Shaanxi was well done.
In Hungary no such survey was done and so even when trouble broke out, the authorities were ignorant of the causes behind it.
This should be taken as a les-son and a thorough investigation of components of workers should be made, ascertaining the numbers of dependables, neutrals and problematic ones.
Ac-cording to a recent survey, only about 25 percent are dependables.
We should stress the importance of workers.
After three five-year plans, the situation may have changed.
It will take 20 years to change the components of the college student body.
We cannot make any radical change now even if we put many workers and peasants in college.
At the 20th Soviet Congress, Stalin was downgraded: Very neatly done.
But now Stalinism has been revived.
What they did first was sincere but what they did recently was not so.
They struck down imperialism with one blow.
They struck down socialism with several blows.
They denounced Poznan and Hun-gary but they would not admit that their moves were not sincere.

The Philosophical Problem Whoever can analyze, understands dialectics.
Lenin said, “In brief, dialec-tics can be defined as the doctrine of the unity of opposites.
This grasps the kernel of dialectics but it requires explanations and development”.
432 He added “The unity of opposites (coincidence, identity, equal action) is conditional, temporary, transient, relative.
The struggle of the mutually exclusive oppo-sites is absolute, just as development and movement are absolute.
”433 Balance is temporary and subject to continuous destruction—lasting for a few days or a 432.

few months.
Balance soon becomes imbalance.
Unity means uniformity, one-ness and unanimity.
If there is a divergence of views, discussion at a meeting will result in unanimity.
But two months later, new problems will arise and another meeting must be held.
Practicality and subjectivism are opposites of unity.
Subjectivism always exists, even 10,000 years from now.
Materialism and idealism are opposites of unity.
Dialectics and metaphys-ics are opposites of unity.
There is perpetual struggle in philosophy.
Whoever talks about philosophy has to struggle.
Some people talk only about one-sided philosophy.
When they talk about the blooming of hundred flowers, they over-look weeding of poisonous weeds.
We admit that socialism has its opposites.
Thus Stalin had his metaphysics and subjectivism.
The Soviet Union does not recognize opposites and does not permit them in law.
But many errors are hidden under socialism.
Lenin contended that materialism alone cannot solve problems, and that the way to solve problems is to struggle against idealism.
If we want to struggle against idealism, we have to study it.
The three components of Marxism were derived through a study of the struggle against capitalism.
Philosophy consists of a struggle between two opposites; Cosmology is a struggle between materialism and idealism; methodology is a struggle between dialectics and metaphysics.
We and Chiang Kai-shek are opposites of unity.
We and the democratic personages are also opposites of unity.
All things have contradictions which may be obliquely reconciled.
Stalin made mistakes in di-alectics.
“Negation of negations.
” The October Revolution negated capitalism but it refused to admit that socialism may be negated too.
We believe that the world is both stable and unstable.
Even socialism may cease to exist one day.
If anyone says that the superstructure of society won’t be extinct, that kind of talk is not Marxism but smacks of religion.
4.
The Problem of the Villages A bounteous harvest is very important.
Last year the Soviet Union had a bounteous harvest and it was easy to do a lot of things.
With last year’s experi-ence we should try to reap a bounteous harvest this year.
If we all work hard to get it, it will be of great significance to the world communist movement.
This will be an unprecedented event in a socialist movement.
In history, the socialist cooperative movement resulted in decreased production.
Our increase in pro-duction in 1956 was not much.
We should strive for a major increase in 1957.
One of our objectives is to increase the income of cooperative members 90 percent.
We shall see if we can do this in three or four years.
Hubei has had a bounteous harvest, but still about 15 percent of its cooperative members had no increase in income.
We should explain to party members, public function-aries, servicemen and civilians that cooperativization has a history of only one to one and one-half years.
We have participated in the revolutionary move-ment for practically our entire lives and still we made mistakes.
Participants in the cooperative movement have carried on for only over one year.
How could they make no mistakes? In three years’ time it is possible that 90 percent of the cooperative members will have higher incomes.
About 15 percent of the peasants have a hard life.
It is not right to gener-alize that the peasants are leading a hard life when only 10 to 15 percent of them are doing so.
There should be an accurate analysis.
When we say that the peasants are leading a hard life, actually this means that the income of the rich middle-class peasants has decreased whereas a portion of the old cadres have become rich.
It reflects the thinking of the landlords, rich peasants and rich middle-class peasants.
Article 40 was discussed at least year’s National Party Congress.
It should be publicized.
We should strive to reach the target production of 400, 500 and 800 catties per mou a year434 ahead of schedule and complete the 12-year plan in 11 years.
The beginning is always difficult.
There are three stages for every perfor-mance.
We completed the first stage this year.
We need to carry out three five-year plans to reach our goal.
Since ancient times, all progressive plans have incurred criticism in the be-ginning.
The theory of evolution, Marx, Sun Yat-sen, and the Communist Party have all incurred criticism.
Even 10,000 years hence progressive things will still incur criticism.
So long as one cooperative shows its superior quality, it can refute all groundless criticism.
We can use it for propaganda.

Economic Problems Every province has established its own chemical fertilizer plant.
We should pay attention to food-grain production.
It will be disastrous if 434.

we don’t.
When we have food, we have everything.
If there is food to eat even during a labor strike or a student strike, no great disturbance will occur.
Oils and pork are the province of cooperatives.
The state does not get involved in it.
Food-grains collected are similarly handled (except in areas of economic products).
The state handles unified purchasing but not unified marketing in the rural area.
Cooperatives and teams handle it themselves.
Two years hence there should be no contending with the people for grain or fear that the state won’t purchase grain.
It needs only to handle unified pur-chasing and not unified marketing.
This is being done in Hsiao-kan county in Hubei province.
State farms should be established in new industrial and mining districts to solve the problems of grain, oils, meat and vegetables.
We need big [industrial] plants, but not too many.
We need small plants even more, the more the better.
Like everything else they grow from small to big.
Small plants should be established in accordance with the principle of availability of raw materials and marketing possibilities whereas the number of big plants should depend upon the resources of the state.
6.
The Problem of Schools Agriculture should be added to the curriculum of junior-middle schools.
The provincial and municipal committees should commission cadres to strengthen the schools.
They should invigorate the schools as well as other cultural and educational work.
Members of the provincial area and county committees should take part in educating the students.
Each province should hold a students congress and a teachers congress ev-ery year.
Adequate preparations should be made beforehand.
One day should be devoted to reports and three days to discussion and problem solving.
No arrangement has yet been made for work on the students.
Every year there should be one or two meetings and one or two talks.
Try to discover problems.
Don’t wait for problems to rise and then try to cope with them.
Get after them now.
Plants, cooperatives stores and schools are the units concerned.
7.
The Problem of Literature and Art There is advantage in having “a hundred schools contend,” for then all evilelements will be exposed.
All provinces should pay attention to this: Let one person take command over major and far advanced problems.
Organize some people to write articles, one article per month, to suppress evil influences.
Vaccination creates bodily resistance to diseases (causing the body to devel-op antibodies).
Why can’t we inject vaccines in literature and art? The Department of Propaganda should hold one or two press conferences in one or two months.
It would be all right to hold one press conference in two months.
Right now there is not one press conference in one year.
8.
The Problem of Cadres Cadres have been promoted to higher positions, but they don’t have much to do in these positions.
The fewer people in leadership positions the better.
They do nothing but write articles and talk on the phone.
The state is the vehicle for class struggle.
Only a limited number of people are required to run the state.
Do we need as many as 500 million people to run the state? How can we promote university professors? Shouldn’t they be uni-versity professors until their hair is snow white? How can we promote workers and peasants? Shouldn’t they be workers and peasants until their hair is snow white? Promotion to a higher position creates a problem.
Once anyone dies, we have to appoint someone else to succeed him.
Ultra democracy and ultra equality won’t work.
Yen Yuan automatically became a second-rank sage.
The numbers of cadres from elsewhere and those local-born should be ad-justed.
Of members of the county committee, half should be from elsewhere and half local-born.
9.
The Problem of Leadership Members of the Party Central Committee, secretaries of provincial com-mittees and ministers should pay a visit to plants and villages every year so as to familiarize themselves with the conditions there and not to become another Rakasi.
Secretaries of provincial committees and ministers have seen so much of their various departments that they are blind to what they see.
They should go instead to the plants and cooperatives.
Real knowledge comes from the plants, cooperatives, stores, and schools.
The higher you go, the less knowledge you get.
If you want to solve problems, you have first to go down and secondly to summon people to report to you.
Beijing is not a good place to acquire knowledge.
By comparison the province is better for this purpose.
You must go down.
Ministers of industries should go down to the plants and heads of rural departments should go to the rural areas.
Members of the Party Central Committee, ministers and secretaries of pro-vincial committees should each take sometime to visit the rural areas and study the problems there.
It takes only two months to get a clear picture of a county or a township.
If for two months they don’t read telegrams, they still can read and understand them when they pick them up again.
But I have been told that they don’t go to the rural areas any more on the excuse that there is too much office work to do.
The secretary of a provincial committee can concurrently be the secretary of a county or municipal committee.
The incumbent may be demoted to be second secretary.
Secretaries of provincial area and county committees can con-currently be plant managers, school principals and secretaries of party com-mittees.
In this manner, they can go deep into reality and acquire knowledge.
There should be two meetings of district party committees secretaries so that they are compelled to study various problems.
The wind that I have broken does not smell good.
It has opposites too— part of it smells good but part of it bad (including Beijing).
You have to smell to know.
All provinces should take note of this fact: Cities depend upon the working class, villages upon poor peasants, and schools upon leftists—all have to have something to depend upon.

Talk at the Hangzhou Conference of the Shanghai Bureau April 1957 (During the discussion of ideological questions, Chairman Mao interjected and set five questions straight.
) 1.
Since the Supreme State Conference and the Propaganda Conference,435 435.
See Speech at the CCPs National Conference on Propaganda Work, Selected Works of Maothe tense atmosphere with the intellectuals has become more moderate and intellectuals outside the party have taken steps to draw near to us, their hesitant mood rather more open.
The report is not a panacea; we must still adminis-ter medicines specific to the individual.
If we do not give them those things which are necessary, they will become passive.
Once the things are given them, they will assume responsibility for contending, whether well or badly.
In any case there will always come a day when the rectification will descend upon ourselves.
Our methods are first to rectify ourselves and rectify the party well, to rectify modestly and to speak reasonably.
The present problem is not our problem.
Leftist intellectuals want democracy (freedom to speak out) from us and students want democracy from their professors.
At that time they have to ask us for help.
When we allow speaking out, they contend among themselves; when we curtail, they make demands on us.
Last year over 11,000 democratic parties developed in Shanghai.
The problems among them multiplied.
Only the proletariat does not fear political change, when it is wrong, it makes corrections.
Their internal problems mul-tiplied.
We must allow speaking out, be thick-skinned, and let them attack for a year.
As long as we have dogmatism, it is good to finish it off.
If the attack is ex-cessive, let all freaks and monsters come out to stir up trouble.
The Communist Party must let them curse for a moment, let them curse for several months; we will reflect on what they say.
During the “three evils” period, Comrade Chen I said, “Our dictatorship has ruled for all these years, so we can let people swear for a week.
” You pour a torrent of question upon us, and we too can be greatly amazed.
Some intellectuals are still afraid of casting a long line to catch big fish.
Some say this is correct.
The prestige of the Communist Party is high.
If there are but one or two sentences in a newspaper, a rustle of wind in the grass, some people are afraid.
Those outside the party are afraid, and those inside the party are afraid.
Even when the affair is correct, we must still be rather modest.
When pressure is great, we must understand things well; some say there is some reason in casting a long line to catch big fish.
We now let people criticize and then analyze the matter once again.
The intellectuals are like birds startled at the twang of a bowstring; they have to look at facts, maybe for 20 years.
Those within the party must also take a look at what happens; for instance, in curing the sickness to save the patient, some people are unbelieving until afterwards when they have seen the facts; only then do they believe.
We must undergo Tse-tung, Volume V.
several tests, the politics of the Communist Party must be tested, leaders must be tested by those they lead.
In the past the intellectuals served the old rulers.
Now the production relationships have been transformed and they no longer have a social base.
Intellectuals in the past entrusted themselves to feudalism, capitalism, and the individual system of production.
The intellectuals serve the class they were born into.
The classes of their birth have now been destroyed, so they hang in mid-air, they do not stand on firm ground.
They are now crawling upon our bodies.
The workers and peasants, through the Communist Party, let them work and eat.
We must still cleanse their brains for a dozen years, using the method of unity — criticism — unity.
They think they do not have to have criticism, that they are unable to speak.
At present there are over 10 million people suspended in mid-air with old brains, but this is nothing to be afraid of.
Hanging in mid-air they very much need us to reach out and draw them in.
If we reach out to them warmly, it can go a bit faster.
It will not be that simple for the majority to come over.
It is the proletariat which most welcomes change.
The peasants most hope that Chiang Kai-shek, the American imperi-alists, and the landlords are transformed, but they do not hope that the small private ownership system will be transformed.
The democratic parties and the intellectuals who see the advent of a cultural revolution as too unexpected, too hurried, can also change.
The hair has left their hide, but their soul is still on the old hide.
When their hair is attached to a proletarian body, their soul is often restless.
If they do not change they cannot be restless, restlessness is a manifestation of change.
The world view of some intellectuals cannot change for a long time.
.
.
To test the world view of writers we must test whether they can work as one with the workers and peasants, or as two.
Send to the coun-try-side those who cannot tell the truth to the peasants.
The world view of bureaucrats within the party also creates problems and is divorced from the masses.
Such people advocate Marxism, but have nothing in common with the masses.
What kind of Marxism is that? There is a group of people in society whose only fear is that everything is not stirred up.
They have anti-Communist thoughts and advocate fighting their way out.
It will take decades to reform them.
Some will die unreformed, but the majority can reform.
There is that portion who are old bigots and will die unreformed.
2.
We must allow airing of views.
To fear airing of views means we have not put the truth across, or not convincingly.
This is anti-bureaucratism in leader-ship.
Whenever airing of views is not allowed, without the slightest preparationthere is a massive airing of views.
We advocate airing of views so that even the worst disturbance is only temporary.
When they manage the affairs of the people but the people are still dissatisfied, some do not think it through and become very troubled.
There are always dissatisfied people; some are satisfied, others dissatisfied.
They are more satisfied than in the past, but they are dissat-isfied compared to what they will be or compared to others who are now better off.
It will be the same 10,000 years from now.
If everyone becomes satisfied, we might as well go to sleep.
There has as yet been no airing of views, so how do we know that there may be a disturbance? In the past our alertness to class struggle was too high; now we are a bit conservative.
One school of thought has contended alone for so many years.
Let there be some disturbances for a while and we will see what happens.
Not to criticize egregious errors over a long period is not good.
Where there is a lot of grass, you may use a tractor.
Chiang Kai-shek is not grass, but he was beaten in three years.
Ten percent of China’s intellectuals comprehend Marxism; 80 percent are patriotic and sup-port socialism.
One can see that poisonous weeds are only a minority.
Weeds among the fresh flowers, which seem poisonous but are not, are in the majori-ty.
This is a reflection of social reality.
This is a new problem.
The cadres have not examined it yet.
When they check it out, taste it, their worries will vanish.
Even if it is not explained clearly, can the people still oppose the Communist Party? Those which seem poison-ous but are not are the majority; the poisonous weeds are in the minority.
I do not encourage the people to make trouble or to organize troublemak-ing groups.
Making trouble by attacking government offices must be punished.
Nonetheless there will be some disorder.
Sprits are now running high outside the party.
In a while, spirits within the party may also rise up, first low then high.
To solve some problems, get some experience.
Every policy of the party must be tested by being carried to the masses.
We should let the cadres test it in their work.
Fearing and not fearing, being happy and being unhappy, solving problems and not solving them: this is dialectics.
For instance, in waging war, at the beginning one is quite afraid, but the more he fights, the more courageous he becomes.
Without having had several errors in line, we could not be so good today.
If good things abound, one may become proud and bad things may arise.
The Soviet Union is like that.
Wang Ming’s errors were great; he made no self-examination, had no prestige.
When you make a mistake, be tense fora week.
Examining the situation will make things better and will also have an immunizing effect.
I would like to attack Deng thoroughly on the question of the.
.
.
cooperatives.
Attacking is a way of helping a cadre.
At the most I will lose a vote and he will not nominate me.
Ba Jin says miscellaneous writings are hard to write.
1) When the rectifi-cation of the Communist Party is complete, there will be an atmosphere of freedom; 2) thoroughgoing materialists are fearless.
Wang Xifeng said, “He who is not afraid of death by a thousand cuts dares to unhorse the emperor.
” The more difficult the time, the more one should help him.
If we do not help him, he will not be able to survive.
What is wrong with making an athletic field out of Lu Xun’s tomb? Chen Qitong and Zhong Tianfei represent two different one-sided views.
I too am a one-sided believer in not mourning.
.
.
.
This could be transformed into a cycli-cal theory, but dialectics is not a cyclical theory.
When one-sidedness has multiplied, dialectics must be brought out.
Since these people just want us to have bad luck, we can think of an even worse situation.
At present it seems that we have become somewhat conservative, but in persuading the masses we cannot use simplified methods.
This is not a thorough solution to the problem of the creation of disturbances.
It will not do to handle affairs excessively.
Who says we want monsters and freaks? The masses want to see them.
We cannot suppress it, just give better perfor-mances.
We should let society be a bit complicated, put the center of gravity on science.
Some people say we should be more brutal than the Kuomintang in expelling students who cause disturbances.
We should be a bit wiser than the Kuomintang, so that a comparison between it and us will be all the better.
The Kuomintang is digging its own grave; we should not study it.
I still feel bad because the Guangdong students were prevented from coming to Beijing with their petitions.
The Kuomintang exercises dictatorship over the people, the Communist Party preaches democracy.
This point should be clear.
Some take the atom bomb of dictatorship and hang it over the people’s heads.
This is not good.
3.
Let 100 flowers bloom, let 100 schools of thought contend.
We must change the relationship between the party and the intellectuals.
Some think it is not the time for that, that there are contradictions in political—ideological work.
Widespread political struggle is already basically at an end.
The Eighth Party Congress concluded it.
This guideline submits that now is precisely thetime.
Between party and non-party there is a ditch which is very deep.
I think that to say there is no ditch, or there is no line of demarcation, is not good, but it is not good to dig a ditch, for if there is a ditch, we will be divorced from the masses.
In one of the 1,000,000 factories in Shanghai less than one in 10,000 caused disturbances.
One percent would be better; it could wipe out bureaucratism.
From inside the party to outside the party, those inside the party and those outside the party speak with each other, act in the same play.
In this way many people can be drawn onto the political stage.
Whose newspaper is Renmin Ribao [People’s Daily]? It must be rectified.
Some feel they cannot move to the left or the right and it is difficult to do anything.
To know it is difficult to do anything is good, it gets the brain moving; otherwise there will just be talk of dictatorship, of centralism (that is, suppression).
Must there be struggle within the party? Of course.
The peasants hoe weeds every year.
Errors must be criticized with the power of persuasion.
One cannot rely on suppression.
It will not do to rely on several documents.
We must per-suade people with reason, not rely on our qualifications.
Preach force towards enemies, reason towards the people.
If there is no reason, it is not historicism.
It is not enough to have a high position.
We must study and do more research.
It is very dangerous for cadres to pull rank and speak with force.
Can we do without the democratic parties? No.
The Soviet Union does not have them and does not hear contrary opinions.
But the war was still fought victoriously, and they did not kill the intellectuals.
The Soviet Union does not consider letting 100 flowers bloom, 100 schools of thought contend.
Demo-cratic party members are all big intellectuals.
The Peasants and Workers Dem-ocratic Party has no peasants or workers.
We must give them something to do.
Unite both ends and criticize the middle.
Not to criticize is rightist.
The articles by Zhong Dianfei have not been criticized for a long time since they appeared.
The criticisms in Wenhui Bao must be throughly analyzed.
436 This criticism is beneficial.
We must speak the truth to members of the democratic parties.
If they have 436.
See Wen Hui Bao’s Bourgeois Orientation Should be Criticized, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V, pp.
451-456.
Also see the following article in this volume.
flaws, tell them.
Belonging to a democratic party has its suffering.
One cannot hear or see or grasp the basis of the Communist Party.
We can also talk of some of the party’s defects.
If we strike down the democratic personages, they will rise to oppose us.
It is quite necessary to learn from them with an open mind.
A number of meetings have been held, but no news of them has appeared.
The Renmin Ribao [People’s Daily] is the Guomin Ribao [Citizen’s Daily].
Chen Qitong represents 90 percent of the comrades within the party, so I have no mass base.
Between inside the party and outside it there should be a line, not a wall.
The first secretary should regularly meet with personages outside the party, to explain our basis to them.
We can also talk with the enemy in order to attract him to us more deeply.
Not to talk is not democratic.
Allowing talk is also attracting the enemy further; what can be done about that? We must proceed from our 600 million people and become a bit more adventurous.
There are 5 million intellectuals.
We must win them over.
Mo Pu is a sectarian.
We should check out his party affiliation.
Why does he not want traditional Chi-nese paintings? He does not do works of art, but works of hideousness.
Even the Kuomintang has traditional paintings.
What is his party? Probably a third party! Social reality cannot be denied.
Since there is counterrevolution in social reality, we must suppress it.
Problems have existed for a long time within the framework of democracy.
How can he use the Stanislavsky system for the Huo-shao Hung-lien Shih? Jiang Feng and Mo Pu use the dialectic method—why do they not want traditional paintings? Do they want to go it alone? Even hus-bands and wives come in pairs! Experienced cadres must take into account that the past is only a set of methods, and now we must resolve problems among the people.
I have read several copies of the Hsin Min Bao.
It is not yellow journal-ism.
Just not too serious.
It cannot lead science.
It should not be contrary just to be contrary.
It must ask for guidance.
Even Liu Bei asked a Zhuge Liang for guidance.
What personages outside the party say must be taken into account.
Sometimes they are in error, but do not just be contrary or inflexible.
4.
On the problem of recognizing several problems: There were over 200 letters opposing the article by Fan Ruizhuan.
I do not think it is obscene.
“Daily I ascend into the Kan Ling, how can I do without my husband?” You have to have some pressure to write something; a donkey has to be ridden by someone.
Lead, select reports, prepare, persuade, benefit: five conditions.
Of all these, only the force of persuasion is relatively concrete.
All the others are quite difficult to change, but we must not be dogmatic.
Can one polemize over party policies? Everyone goes along with articles in Renmin Ribao.
But the articles of Chen Jilong and others are not correct.
In my opinion it would be better if each province had two newspapers, one run by those outside the party to provide some competition.
There are always some things which are difficult to carry out in areas where intellectuals are bunched together, but it would not do for them not to be bunched together.
Of the 6 million people in Shanghai, there are only over 200 who are in opposition, obviously a minority.
Nor should the newspapers encourage them day after day.
Hold several meetings a year, in spring, sum-mer, autumn, winter.
The task of culture and education is a matter of teaching the people.
We must supervise it regularly, so as to prevent having to treat every headache and foot ache.
Some people in film studios say to strive for fragrant flowers, not produce poisonous weeds.
This spirit is incorrect.
We are not afraid of one-third coming up poisonous weeds.
To avoid poisonous weeds is an empty phrase.
One-sidedness.
It will never be possible to demand that all outside the party avoid one-sidedness and become experts in dialectics.
The preceding time I spoke from my own position.
There will always be work which is done well and that which is not done well.
The question of intellectuals entering the party.
We should strive to have one-third enter the party.
The democratic party members may cross over into the party, but not the leaders.
Within 6 years one-fourth, within three 5-year plans one-third will enter the party.
This year strive for 15 percent — we must proceed at a measured pace.
If we do not win over a group of intellectuals into the party this year, it will not be good for socialism.
Let 100 flowers bloom, 100 schools of thought contend is a policy for winning over the intellectuals.
If we shut the door to them organizationally, we will not be consistent.
Our party has no great authors, great poets, great professors — we must recruit them.
In the past it was not to be done, now we must exert ourselves to do it.
Gorky attended school for only two years and Sun Yat-sen did not receive a very high level of education.
People can be trained.
There is a reason for instability in education.
Beginning without experience, once we make several changes, things will become stable.
Among teaching ma-terials for junior middle schools there should be history, geography, the study of cultural relics, and the like.
In the past, middle and primary schools studied foreign cultures, which they should do.
There are too many courses in juniormiddle schools.
We could chop off one-third.
How can 100 schools of thought contend in a classroom? We should focus on one or a few.
The checkup on the suppression of counterrevolutionaries was done in 1955 and 1956.
In the past there was no checkup.
It is incorrect to speak of a contradiction between a progressive social sys-tem and backward forces of production.
The question of birth control.
Malthus’ conclusions are wrong,437 but must there be war when there are too many people? In China’s birth control we must consider provincial make up.
There are many people in Jiangsu, few in the Northeast.
We must not change the marriage laws, but should do more persuading against early marriage.
I once said that there will still be revolution in 1000 years.
But this is not certain.
After 10,000 years production relationships will definitely be transformed.
In the future it will not be a matter of nationalization but of globalization.
If contradictions among the people are not handled well, we can be over-thrown.
There have already been some individual township governments and party branch headquarters.
5.
The question of leadership: we must improve the relationship between the Communist Party and the intellectuals.
It is the fault of the Communist Party that it has not been close to the intellectuals.
I do not blame the Ministry of Propaganda, the first secretary must take the responsibility.
The first secre-tary must not only grasp the leadership of ideology but also read documents, history, philosophy, literature.
.
.
periods of history.
When much activity is go-ing on but the first secretary does not do any reading, how can he resolve any-thing? Some say that peripheral things should be done a little less so as to grasp ideological work.
One must read printed matter, literature, natural science, social science.
Get into the habit, then you will gradually become interested in it.
You must also discuss within the party.
You may think there is no time for discussion, but even if you do not discuss, there may still be no time.
In the 437.

R.
Malthus.
Anglican clergyman and reactionary economist.
In his Essay on Pop-ulation (1798), he wrote that “population unchecked.
.
.
increases in geometrical ratio.
.
.
[while] the means of subsistence.
.
.
could not possibly be made to increase faster than in an arithmetical ratio”.
Basing himself on this arbitrary assumption, he came to the conclusion that all poverty and all evils in human society are permanent phenomena of nature.
Accord-ing to him, the only ways to solve the problem of poverty of the working people were to shorten their life-span, reduce the population or stop its increase.
He regarded famine, pestilence and war as means to cut down population.
phrase “100 schools of thought contend,” some people misread “chang-ming” [contend] as “cheng-wu” [complain].
They do not understand that they must continue to go to class.
Zhou Yu is over 20 years old, Cheng Pu over 50.
Now they are arch enemies.
Who is in command? We must have culture in doing cultural and educational work.
When Zhuge Liang was young he did not serve in any important capacity.
Later he did.
At that time one could break the rules and appoint him, why not now? When we were evaluating ranks, there was much disagreement.
There were very many hindrances to promotion which breaks the rules.
It is hard to have soldiers without education, they too should study in their spare time.
Now we are fighting another battle.
Generals, colo-nels, captains, lieutenants, and enlisted men must make renewed preparations.
Cadres at all levels must master social science, literature, and natural science.
Otherwise, when a commander rides into battle and needs a few tricks up his sleeve, his guns will fall silent.
University party committees must be reorga-nized.
Their assumption of cadre tasks is over.
Now they can be transferred, leaving someone at the school to take care of business.
“A hundred schools of thought contend” must not become the principal of the school.
We must do propaganda work, circumstances are forcing you to talk, go to the universities to talk, first have a chat with the professors and students.
Today no talk, then tomorrow no talk, this year no talk, then next year no talk, never any talk; how can we go on this way? Ask the Minister of Culture and Education, the Minister of Propaganda, and the party secretaries to go and have talks.
They are always considerably better at it than the political instructors.
The question of fixed interest.
The nature of enterprises has been trans-formed.
The two major characteristics no longer exist.
When the skin has gone, what can the hair adhere to? The hair is on a proletarian body, but the soul is still there.
To shorten and reduce the fixed interest so that after a long time there will be nothing left but an excuse is not worth it.
Now it is 100 million a year.
In 10 years it will still be 10 million.
If they do not demand that we cancel it, we will still pay it out.
Don’t knock the hat off the petty bourgeoisie, for if the small ones lose their interest, the big ones will be dissatisfied.
In the end it will all be canceled automatically.
Our 600 million people have their faults.
Any person may be criticized and not listened to when he is incorrect.
When he is correct you must accept what he says.
Documents opposing the suppression of counterrevolutionaries or collectivization may be repudiated somewhat.
This is not called leading theenemy out; it is called entrapping oneself.
When Sun Dayu says someone is a counterrevolutionary, we should publish it in the papers.
Publishing the arti-cles on Hu Feng438 and Tito in the newspapers to divorce them from the masses is also a helpful method.
We must have a method in doing political work, not fear publishing; we must repudiate them.
Each province must exchange experiences.
They must not avoid each other.

The Bourgeois Orientation of the Wen-Hui Bao for a Period of Time439 June 14, 1957 This article reproduced below appeared in the Wen-hui Bao on 10 June, en-titled For Reference440 Although for a period of time in the past the Wen-hui Bao in Shanghai and the Kwangming Jih-Bao in Beijing published a large number of good reports and good feature articles, their basic political orientation was that of a capitalist newspaper.
In a period of time these two papers, making use of the slogan, ‘A Hundred Schools Contend’, and the CCP’s rectification campaign, carried many seditious reports showing the bourgeois point of view which [the papers] were not prepared to criticize.
These issue of the papers are there for anyone to consult.
Some people on the staff of the papers seriously misconstrued the functions of newspapers.
They confused the principles of the press of a capitalist country with those of the press of a socialist coun-try.
Similar confusion can be found among the editors and reporters of other newspapers and among the staff of some departments of journalism at the uni-versities.
It is not confined to the Wan-huipao and Kwang-ming Jih-Bao alone, though it is more prominent with these papers.
Mistaken views can be studied, examined, criticized, and then reformed.
[This is what] we expect from these papers.
In the last few days their policy seems to have changed somewhat.
Of course, non-party newspapers should not be exactly the same as party organs; 438.
For more material on Hu Feng, see In Refutation of Uniformity of Public Opinion and Preface and Editors Notes to Material on the Counterrevolutionary Hu Feng Clique, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V.

This was by Yao Wenyuan.
they should have their individualities.
None the less, their general orientation should be the same as other papers, because in a socialist country the press reflects through its reports the planned socialist economy based on public own-ership.
This is different from the press of a capitalist country which reflects through its reports the anarchy and group competition of the capitalist econo-my.
As long as class distinction exists in the world, newspapers are instruments of class struggle.
We hope a discussion on this issue will be developed in order to arrive at a common understanding.
Some journalists who are members of the CCP or the Communist Youth League also have a bourgeois view on jour-nalism; they, too, should study, examine, criticize, and then reform their view.
Doctrinaire views on journalism and the style of the ‘eight-legged essay’ should also be criticized.
These nauseating mistakes are shared by party organs as well, including this paper.
They should be criticized in the discussions.
In that case, a struggle on the two fronts against both the ‘left’ and the right in the field of journalism should be waged.
Yao Wenyuan’s article points out, albeit reserv-edly, the bourgeois tendencies of the Wen-hui pao and sees clearly the harmful tendencies of some people on it to wage a struggle from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.
It is a good article and therefore it is repro-duced here.
We take this opportunity to clarify our views to our professional friends on the Wen-hui pao and Kwang-ming Jih-pao for their consideration.

Letter to Zhou Enlai July 7, 1957 In both colleges and middle schools it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political leadership as well as to revamp ideological and political educa-tion.
It is also necessary to cutdown the curricula, restore political classes for middle schools, abolish the Constitution class and compile new textbooks, on ideology and politics.
Comment on Class Education with Leaders from Shanghai Motor Power Institute July 1957 We must strengthen ideological and political work for youth; we must teach them not to despise labor so that they will be able to construct our nation suc-cessfully! Even if the youth is a young worker, because he has not undergone the hardship of the old society it is all the more necessary to strengthen class education in order to enhance his ideological awareness.
Talk at the Enlarged Third Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CCP441 October 7, 1957 China has had two revolutions.
During the period of democratic revolu-tion it was anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism; only within the party was there a struggle against the capitalist ideology of the national bourgeoisie.
At that time there were two roads, the road of liberation and the road of colonialism.
The socialist revolution is to eradicate classes, to eliminate exploitation; it is the proletarian revolution.
In declaring that there is a primary contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, I hold that in theory there is no problem.
In 1953 at the Finance and Economics Meeting the general line was set forth;442 initially we did not dare to propagate it throughout the entire party but instead we first discussed it at the county level.
At the end of 1953 it was discussed at the Political Consultative Conference.
The Propaganda Depart-ment drafted an outline for dissemination of the general line.
During these past three and one-half years, we have dealt a severe blow to the bourgeoisie; we have also dealt a blow to the individual economy.
Consequently this was reflected in the resolutions of the 8th Party Congress, which said that the con-441.

442.
See The Party’s General Line for the Transition Period, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V.
tradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat had been fundamentally resolved.
This statement was not incorrect, but fundamental resolution is not equivalent to complete resolution.
Once the problem of political authority was resolved, the problem of ownership was fundamentally resolved, but in the economic and political spheres there was not a complete resolution.
Among the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectuals, the rightists in the democratic parties, and a portion of the well-to-do middle peasants, there were those who opposed the people while standing among them.
At that time this was not seen so clearly, but it was not totally unperceived either (at that time we were still carrying out transformation).
At that time they were very submis-sive and obedient, so we said that there was a fundamental resolution.
Today I emphasize this contradiction because they wanted to rebel.
At the Qingdao Conference this year443 we saw clearly and pointed out that in the urban and rural areas there was still a struggle between the two roads.
As this sort of class struggle has not been eradicated and the rightist elements at this time are wild-ly advancing, it must be said that there is a primary contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
But strategically the Qingdao documents have said it well; it is all right if those at the meeting know what is primary and what is secondary.
We have not talked about this for a long time.
If we now add on to it, shaking heaven and earth, it would be bad.
Now we must continue with the Qingdao method of expression for three months.
There is also bourgeois ideology among the workers.
Within the party the three big “isms” have also been unfurled over the bourgeoisie.
The two roads— the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, socialism and capitalism—are the primary contradictions of the transitional era; for the time being we will not discuss them in the report.
Have we discussed whether or not it is possible to mitigate the contradictions among the great mass of the people? On the other hand there are internal bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism; we can write about this problem theoretically.
The relationships among the working people—the contradictions in the relationship between the party and the masses, in the relationship between cadres and the masses, between the individual and the collective, between the young and the old, and among the workers—are very numerous.
If we declare suddenly that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is primary, could this have an effect on the frank airing of views? Not necessarily, 443.
The Qingdao Conference was held in July 1957, it was attended by the secretaries of provincial and municipal party committees.
See The Situation in the Summer of 1957, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V.
but it could cause squabbling among the workers.
There are two segments of the people; one segment has exploited people and one segment has not exploited people.
In one segment few have been in-fluenced by bourgeois ideology while in the other many have been influenced.
After several hundred years it will be impossible to unfurl again the banner of the bourgeoisie; that is the struggle between the advanced and the backward.
When we say that large-scale class struggle has fundamentally ended and that contradictions have been fundamentally resolved, we are speaking of the polit-ical system and the problem of ownership.
But in building the superstructure, the question of ideology and political power in large measures has not been resolved.
Individualism, bureaucratism, idealism are also a matter of building the superstructure and must be resolved.
After the capitalists began to beat their gongs and drums last year, we im-mediately put forth the idea of opposing the bourgeoisie.
They were unable to speak out.
This was unpopular, and the result was disadvantageous to us.
Afterwards we had a frank airing of views, and it was easier to manage; we ac-quired experience and it was easier to manage.
We brought forth “let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend,” and so they let themselves go.
In the past the bourgeoisie had been subservient, and now they raised a great clamor.
We had only brought forth frank airing of views and the rightists aired their views and made a great racket.
We said that there should be a frank airing of views in literature, art, and academic issues, but they wanted to progress to politics.
This year the Communist Party and the rightists have cooperated to find a method, which is good: a loud and frank airing of views, posting of big-character posters, and carrying on great debates, meant the dis-covery of a comparatively more appropriate form.
In Yanan we were not so daring, we had no experience, we did not forbid, but we also did not express.
We had not carried out the socialist revolution and had no experience, and this episode of frank and loud airing of views had increased our experience.
In the future we shall still wish to have a frank airing of views.
Let a hundred flowers blossom does not embrace counterrevolution, however.
We are able to have a frank airing of views once a year.
To suppress the people as though they are enemies is very dangerous.
In discussing contradictions among the people one must guard against adopting the method of suppression and coercion.
The first road is to assert that during the transitional period the primary contradiction is the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
The second road during a prescribed period should not be discussed in thenewspapers, but the struggle between the two roads should continue to be propagandized.
Do not add these two characters and avoid stirring up a lot of trouble.
The contradiction among the working people is today being resolved in the course of the frank airing of views and great debates.
As soon as it is mentioned that the class contradiction is primary, there will be an adverse effect on recti-fication and transformation.
Three classes are included among the people: the proletariat, the bourgeoisie, and the petit bourgeoisie.
A contradiction exists among these three segments of the people.
This contradiction is a contradiction among the people, and it is also a class contradiction.
There is a distinction between class contradictions and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves.
Generally speaking, a contradiction among the people is non-antagonistic, while a contradiction with the bourgeoisie has an antagonistic side.
The central question is the con-tradictions among the three segments of the people.
Among these a portion are covertly antagonistic.
The contradiction with Zhang Bojun, for example, was an antagonistic contradiction.
In confronting this kind of antagonistic contra-diction one should adopt the policy of peeling away the outer skin of a bam-boo shoot.
Each year peel away a little.
This year peel away some of the outer skin, but don’t peel it all away.
After two years of not propagandizing socialism begin again, and afterwards peel away a little more.
The work On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People444 was not mistaken, but it was not as complete as the Qingdao document.
Now the primary problem is not the remnants of feudalism or the remnants of imperialism (the contradiction still exists).
Who hasn’t said that Hunan seized 7,000 landlords and rich peasants, but suddenly there is a problem when you try to seize one Zhang Bojun.
The socialist revolution is a problem for the bourgeoisie and the petit bourgeoisie.
The bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectuals, totaling 30 million including dependents, are a big problem.
At most the working class totals 40 million people.
The targets of the socialist revolution are the bourgeoisie, the bourgeois intellectuals, and the upper petit bourgeoisie (in the countryside the well-to-do middle peasants).
The bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectuals have leftists, while the great majority are centrists and the right wing accounts for only one or two percent.
For more than 90 percent it is a question of education and a question of criticism.
While we say that contradictions among the people 444.
See On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volume V.
embrace class struggle, the bourgeoisie still enjoys civil rights.
It cannot be said that the socialist revolution is anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, but the remnants of imperialist and feudal powers are the allied army of the rightists of the bourgeoisie.
Therefore the landlord paper Ai-wen Hui-pao is anti-socialist.
At present there are 60,000 rightist elements (10,000 acting and 50,000 writing).
In the future at most there will be 150,000 to 200,000.
Of this num-ber those that can be separated should be separated.
For example, towards some engineering and technical personnel, natural scientists, and scholars, it is even better if they can be separated.
We should work on them.
Some people we should criticize seriously buy treat with leniency, as for example Rong Yiren and others.
Now it is clear-cut: in proceeding through the transitional era from capital-ism to socialism, the main (or fundamental) contradiction is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism.
Thus in social relations and interpersonal relations there has been a fundamen-tal resolution, but there has not been a complete resolution.
The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements endorse capitalism, and those who exploit people endorse capitalism.
This is also a contradiction be-tween the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
The struggle between the two roads will be resolved after a long period of struggle.
“Main” and “fundamental” have the same meaning.
The resolutions of the 8th Party Congress declare that the main contradic-tion is the contradiction between the advanced social system and the backward productive forces.
Speaking reasonably, one cannot speak in that manner.
Now there are contradictions, and in the future there will also be contradictions.
When cooperatives have all been transformed into state farms which pay out wages there will still be contradictions.
Socialism is comprised of two sectors: public ownership and collective ownership.
In the future, contradictions will also arise between the two.
The socialist system and the productive forces are fundamentally in conformity, but they also have areas where there is not total conformity.
There are still shortcomings and it is incorrect to say that there is perfect conformity.
When Stalin mentioned perfect conformity (official report, page 14) there arose a problem.
The ideology of religion is not in accord with socialism, but we still want to repair temples.
Repairing temples is done to achieve the goal of tearing down temples.
Why do we say this is by and large in accord? Because it can develop the productive forces.
India undertook a five-year plan and increased its steel output by 300,000 tons.
We raised ouroutput by 94 million tons.
Our system does not impede the development of the productive forces.
After several tens of years the contradiction between the collective and the state-owned sectors will be resolved, but there will still be new contradictions.
When we have arrived at communism, we will not need the law of value and we will not need an army, the international environment permitting of course.
Marx, Engels, and Lenin never said this sentence, which is in the resolutions of the 8th Party Congress, but there is no harm in it.
The meaning is that we must hurriedly develop production, strengthen the mate-rial foundation of socialist society; it is only that this was not said clearly.
The essence of the stylistic faults is that we have not seriously talked about contra-dictions.
It has drawn comparisons with foreign countries and with the future.
It is not necessary to change this sentence now; there is no need to discuss this question now.
Lenin said that there is a contradiction between Soviet power and backward technology.
We will not talk about this now.
Afterwards it will be all right to explain it more clearly.
Strictly speaking, it is of course incorrect to say that the socialist system and the productive forces are not in accord.
We are a socialist system developing its productive forces.
A good many econo-mists say that there is a contradiction between our system and the productive forces and that the productive forces of a socialist system are backward.
This sort of talk is bad.

No Power on Earth Can Separate Us November 2, 1957 Dear Comrades Khrushchev, Voroshilov, and Bulganin: Dear Comrades and Friends: The anniversary of the October Revolution is a great festival of victory for the Soviet people and for the proletariat, the laboring masses, and all oppressed peoples of the world.
The victory won by the Soviet people under the leader-ship of the great Lenin and the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union forty years ago initiated a new epoch in human history.
In the process of forty years of construction, the Soviet Union has made brilliant achievements at an extraordinary speed and in many fields has advanced to the forefront of thecountries of the world, thus setting an outstanding example for the peoples who are striving for progress and happiness.
The launching of the first man-made earth satellite by the Soviet Union is no simple feat.
It marks the begin-ning of a new era of man’s further conquest of nature.
The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong bulwark ensuring world peace and a faithful friend to all peoples who refuse to suffer imperialist oppression and enslavement.
.
.
The October Revolution enabled the Chinese people to find the way to emancipation, prosperity, wealth, and power [fu ch’iang].
In their own cause, the Chinese people have received tremendous sympathy and generous assis-tance from the people of the Soviet Union.
The peoples of our two countries have already formed a fraternal alliance in their common struggles, and there no is force on earth which can separate us.
Comrades, we will stand together forever, fighting for world peace and for the victory of our common cause! Glory to the great October Socialist Revolution! Glory to the great Soviet people and to the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Long live the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples! Long live world peace!

Speech at Moscow Celebration Meeting445 November 6, 1957 Dear Comrades: On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I myself and the other members of the Chinese delegation, repre-senting the National People’s Congress and the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and all the people and Communist Party members of China, have the honor 445.
Speech at a joint meeting of the two Soviets of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (namely the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities) in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution.
to offer warm fraternal congratulations to the people, government and Com-munist Party of the great Soviet Union (enthusiastic applause), and to all the comrades and friends present here.
(Enthusiastic applause.
) As our revolutionary teacher Lenin pointed out time and again, the great revolution carried out by the Soviet people forty years ago initiated a new ep-och in world history.
Historically there have been revolutions of many kinds, but none to com-pare with the October Socialist Revolution.
For thousands of years the working people of the world and all progressive humanity have dreamed of building a society in which there would be no ex-ploitation of man by man.
This dream was realized on one-sixth of the earth’s land surface for the first time in history by the October Revolution.
This rev-olution proves that, without the landlords and the bourgeoisie, the people are completely capable of building a free and happy new life in a planned way.
It also proves that different nations of the world are completely capable of living together amicably once there is no imperialist oppression.
Country which develops its social productive forces at a speed of which the capitalist countries are incapable—and a country which truly practices proletarian internationalism, genuinely opposes national oppression and helps oppressed nations to emancipate themselves.
Such a country enjoys the enthu-siastic support of all its own people and of the peoples of all other countries in the world.
The Soviet Union enjoys these two kinds of support to a degree without parallel in the history of nations.
The face of the Soviet Union has changed completely in the past forty years.
Before the revolution Russia was relatively backward economically and techni-cally.
Now the Soviet Union has become one of the world’s first-class industrial powers.
The living standards of the Soviet people have been steadily rising.
The scale of development of educational, scientific and cultural establishments in the Soviet Union far surpasses that of the capitalist countries.
The Soviet Union set up the world’s first atomic power station, made the world’s first batch of passenger jet planes and intercontinental ballistic rockets and launched the world’s first and second man-made earth satellites.
The whole world acknowl-edges that the success of the Soviet Union in launching the man-made earth satellites on two occasions has opened up a new era in the conquest of nature by man.
Not only the Soviet people, but also the world proletariat and all mankind can take pride in all this.
(Applause.
) Only a few reactionaries are unhappy about it.
The creative application of Marxism-Leninism by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in tackling practical tasks has ensured unbroken success in the Soviet people’s construction work.
The fighting program for communist construction in the Soviet Union put forward by the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a good example.
The wise mea-sures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the questions of overcoming the cult of the individual, developing agriculture, reorganizing the administration of industry and construction, ex-tending the power of the union republics and local organizations, opposing the anti-Party group, consolidating unity within the Party and improving the Party and political work in the Soviet army and navy, will undoubtedly promote still further the consolidation and development of all undertakings in the Soviet Union.
Throughout the world the people have begun to see their own future ever more clearly in the successes gained by the Soviet people.
Essentially, the path of the Soviet Union, the path of the October Revolution, is the bright com-mon way for the progress of all mankind.
(Enthusiastic applause.
) The masses of the people throughout the world celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution warmly, because the history of the past forty years has convinced them that the proletariat is In the past forty years the Soviet people have traveled a hard road.
The imperialists tried by every means to destroy the world’s first socialist republic.
The enemies of the Soviet Union appeared for a time to be stronger than the Soviet Union and twice launched armed attacks against it.
But the courageous Soviet people, led by their glorious Communist Party, thoroughly smashed the attacks of the aggressors.
(Applause.
) The Soviet Union has been invincible because it is a country in which the socialist system has replaced the capitalist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat has replaced the dictatorship of the exploiting classes — a certain to defeat the bourgeoisie, socialism is certain to defeat capitalism, and the op-pressed nations are certain to defeat the imperialists.
Of course, difficulties, twists and turns still face the people.
But it was well said by Lenin thirty-six years ago: “The important thing is that the ice has been broken, the road is open and the path has been blazed.
” (Enthusiastic applause.
) The people’s revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party has always been a part of the world socialist revolution of the proletariat initiated by the October Revolution.
The Chinese revolution has its own national characteris-tics and it is entirely necessary to take these into consideration.
But in our own revolution and socialist construction we have made full use of the rich experi-ence of the Communist Party and the people of the Soviet Union.
The Chinese people are fortunate in having the experience of the October Revolution and of the socialist construction in the Soviet Union, which enables them to make fewer mistakes, to avoid many others and to pursue their cause fairly smoothly, although they still face many difficulties.
It is clear that, after the October Revolution, if a proletarian revolutionary of any country should overlook or not seriously study the experience of the Russian revolution, of the proletarian dictatorship and of socialist construction of the Soviet Union, and should fail to use these experiences analytically and in a creative way in the light of the specific conditions in his own country, he would not be able to master Leninism, which represents new stage in the development of Marxism, and he would not be able to solve the problems of revolution and construction in his own country correctly.
He would ei-ther commit doctrinaire or revisionist mistakes.
We must oppose both these deviations simultaneously, but at present, to oppose revisionist deviation is a particularly urgent task.
It is equally clear that, since the October Revolution, any government that refuses to be on friendly terms with the Soviet Union only harms the real inter-ests of its own people.
(Prolonged, enthusiastic applause.
) In the world today a series of European and Asian countries with an aggre-gate population of over nine hundred million people have victoriously taken the path of the October Revolution and form a powerful world system of socialism.
Capitalism has for some time lost its superiority, and socialism has become invincible.
In the end the socialist system will replace the capitalist system.
This is an objective law independent of human will.
No matter how hard the reactionar-ies try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will take place sooner or later and will surely triumph.
(Prolonged, enthusiastic applause.
) “To lift a rock, merely to crush one’s own foot” is a Chinese saying to describe the action of fools.
The reactionaries of every country are just such fools.
Their persecution of the revolutionary people will only end in rousing the people to broader and fiercer revolution.
(Enthusiastic applause.
) Did not persecution by the Russian tsar and Chiang Kai-shek of the revolutionary people serve precise-ly to stimulate the great Russian and Chinese revolutions? As well as staking their fate on the oppression of the peoples at home and inthe colonial and semi-colonial countries, the imperialists put their hope in war.
But what can they expect out of war? In the past half century, we have experi-enced two world wars.
After the First World War, the Great October Socialist Revolution took place in Russia.
And after the Second World War, more rev-olutions took place in East Europe and in the East.
If the imperialist warriors are determined to start a third world war, they will bring about no other result than the end of the world capitalist system.
(Enthusiastic applause.
) The governments and peoples of the socialist countries are the builders of a new peaceful life.
We absolutely do not want war, and are firmly opposed to a new world war.
The Soviet Union, China and the other socialist countries have been consistently working for the relaxation of international tension.
The proposals made again and again by the Soviet Union for disarmament and the prohibition of the manufacture, use and testing of weapons of mass de-struction, represent the common stand of the socialist countries, and accord at the same time with the interests of all peoples.
We firmly stand for peaceful competition between the socialist and the capitalist countries, and for the set-tlement of the internal affairs of each country by its own people in accordance with their own desires.
We firmly maintain that all nations should practice the well-known Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territo-rial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence.
The US imperialists obstinately try to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including those of the socialist countries.
For example, they are interfering with the liberation of Taiwan by China and they engineered the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary.
They are particularly rabid in interfer-ing in the internal affairs of those countries situated in the area between the US and the socialist camp.
The US is still planning to invade independent Syria through Turkey or Israel, it is still conspiring to subvert the anti-colonialist Egyptian Government.
This maniac aggressive policy of the US has not only precipitated a crisis in the Middle East, but has also created the danger of a new world war.
All people in the world who love peace and freedom stand by Syria and oppose the US and Turkish aggressors, just as they stood by Egypt and opposed the British, French and Israeli aggressors in October last year.
The Soviet Government has served warning on the US and Turkey to give up their aggressive plan immediately.
The Chinese Government and people resolutely support Syria in its struggle to defend itself and firmly endorse the just position of the Soviet Union.
(Prolonged, enthusiastic applause.
)The imperialist wolves should remember that the days when they could manipulate the fate of humanity and carve up the Asian and African countries as they liked have gone forever.
The US imperialists have tried and are still trying hard to undermine the liberation of the Chinese people.
But in the end they could not prevent the six hundred million Chinese people from bravely taking the path of socialism.
(Applause.
) In the short period of eight years, China has already achieved such results in various fields of construction as it was not able to achieve in the past hundred years.
In China, a handful of bourgeois rightists try to oppose taking the path of socialism and oppose the leading position of the Communist Party in national life, and the close alliance between China and the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries.
Their vain efforts have been utterly defeated by the counter-attack of the people throughout our country.
(Applause.
) The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are car-rying out a vigorous rectification campaign in order to develop socialism in China rapidly and on a firmer basis.
It is a campaign to resolve correctly the contradictions which actually exist among the people and which have to be resolved immediately, by means of a nation-wide debate which is both guided and free, carried out in the urban and rural areas on such questions as the socialist road and the capitalist road, the basic systems and major policies of the state, the working style of the Communist Party and government func-tionaries, and the welfare of the people—a debate conducted by bringing out the facts and by argument.
This is a socialist campaign of self-education and self-remolding by the people and great successes have already been recorded in it.
The socialist consciousness of the people has been rapidly raised, false ideas clarified, shortcomings in work overcome, unity within the ranks of the people strengthened, and labor discipline and productivity increased, wherever the campaign has been carried out.
(Applause.
) We are now carrying forward this people’s self-education campaign among our six hundred million people stage by stage and section by section and it is probable that in another few months nation-wide success will have been achieved.
In future we intend to conduct a rectification campaign every year or every other year—the time it takes can be greatly shortened—as one of the main methods of resolving various social contradictions in our country during the whole period of transition.
The basic starting point in practicing this method is the firm confidence that the majori-ty of the masses are after all on our side and that they will listen to reason.
This point has been proved by all our experience in the campaign.
In many years of revolutionary practice we have developed the method of the rectification campaign in accordance with the Leninist principles of keep-ing in close contact with the masses, recognizing the initiative of the masses, and practicing criticism and self-criticism.
The correctness of this method has once again been proved by the present socialist self-education movement.
China has received brotherly assistance towards its socialist construction in many fields from the Soviet Union.
In celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, please allow us to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party, the government and the people of the So-viet Union, for giving China such friendly help.
(Enthusiastic, prolonged ap-plause.
) Soon after it was founded, the People’s Republic of China concluded a Trea-ty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union.
This is a great alliance of two great socialist countries.
We share the same destiny and the same life-spring with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp.
(En-thusiastic applause.
) We regard it as the sacred international obligation of all socialist countries to strengthen the solidarity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.
(Applause.
) All possible means of sowing discord are used by the imperialist powers headed by the US in their efforts to disrupt the friendship and solidarity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.
But reality is sure to disappoint the imperialists.
The socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are more closely united than ever.
Since the dawn of history, it was not possible for re-lations between nations to be based on such identity of interests, such mutual respect and confidence, and such mutual assistance and inspiration as between the socialist countries.
This is because the socialist countries are of an entirely new type in which the exploiting classes are overthrown and the working peo-ple are in power.
The principle of integrating internationalism with patriotism has been practiced in the relations between these countries.
We are closely bound by common interests and ideals.
Marx said in his inaugural address to the Workingmen’s International Association: “Past experience has shown how disregard of that bond of brotherhood which ought to exist between the work-men of different countries, and incite them to stand firmly by each other in all their struggles for emancipation, will be chastised by the common discomfiture of their incoherent efforts.
” This teaching of Marx more than ninety years ago will never be out-of-date for us.
(Applause.
) Dear comrades, the fact that representatives of the working class and massesof the people of various countries of the world are here today to attend this grand meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, held to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution demonstrates in itself the great solidarity of the people’s forces of the world and symbolizes the flour-ishing condition of the international socialist movement.
Let us continue our efforts to strengthen the solidarity of the socialist countries, and of the working people and oppressed nations of the world, in order to attain new and greater victories.
(Prolonged, enthusiastic applause.
) Long live the Great October Socialist Revolution! (Prolonged, enthusiastic applause.
) Long live the solidarity and friendship of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union! (Prolonged, enthusiastic applause.
) Long live the great banner of Marxist-Leninist internationalism! (Pro-longed, enthusiastic applause.
) The proletariat and peace-loving people of the whole world, unite! (Pro-longed, enthusiastic applause.

T﻿﻿he East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind November 17, 1957 …Chairman Mao pointed out first of all that the October Socialist Revo-lution marks a turning point in world history; the appearance in the heavens of two artificial satellites and the coming to Moscow of delegates from the sixty-four communist and workers’ parties to celebrate the holiday of the Oc-tober Revolution mark a new turning point.
The forces of socialism surpass the forces of imperialism The imperialist forces have a leader, America; our socialist camp must also have a leader, and that leader is the Soviet Union.
If we do not have a leader our forces might disintegrate! Chairman Mao.
.
.
said it was an event of great significance that the com-munist and workers’ parties of sixty-four countries attended the celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.
It showed the solidarity of the socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, it showed the solidarity of the communists and workers’ parties the world over, with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as their center.
Chairman Mao said that the direction of the wind in the world had changed.
In the struggle between the socialist and capitalist camps, it was no longer the west wind that prevailed over the East wind, but the East wind that prevailed over the West wind.
The whole world now has a population of 2.
7 million, of which the various socialist countries have nearly one billion, the independent former colonial countries more than 700 million, the countries now struggling for independence or for complete independence plus the capitalist countries with neutralist tendencies 600 million, and the imperialist camp only about 400 million, besides which they are also divided internally.
Earth quakes are likely to occur over there.
At present, Chairman Mao said, it was not the west wind that was prevail-ing over the East wind, but the east wind prevailing over the west wind.
