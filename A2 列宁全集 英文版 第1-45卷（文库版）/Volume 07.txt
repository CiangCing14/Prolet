LCW: 7: Preface by Progress Publishers







Lenin
      Collected Works: Volume 7: Preface by Progress Publishers




Lenin Collected Works: 
Volume 7
Preface by
      Progress Publishers



    This seventh volume of Lenin's works covers the period from
    September 1903 to December 1904.
  

    The major item in it is his book, One Step Forward, Two Steps
    Back, which elaborated the organisational principles of the
    Bolshevik Party.
  

    Many of the works in the present volume—the “Account of
    the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.", the article “One Step
    Forward, Two Steps Back. Reply by N. Lenin to Rosa Luxemburg”,
    the speeches at the Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary
    Social-Democracy Abroad and the sessions of the Party Council, and
    the resolutions moved there, the draft appeal “To the
    Party”, and the pamphlet “The Zemstvo Campaign and
    Iskra's Plan"—are directed against the Mensheviks'
    opportunism in organisational and tactical questions and against
    their splitting activities.
  

    The letters included in this volume—"Letter to the Members of
    the Central Committee”, “To Five Members of the Central
    Committee”, “Letter to Central Committee Agents and
    Committee Members of the R.S.D.L.P. Siding with the Second Party
    Congress Majority” and the “Letter to Glebov
    (V. A. Noskov)"—illustrate Lenin's fight against the
    conciliators.
  

    "What We Are Working For”, “To the Party”,
    “A Letter to the Comrades”, and the “Announcement
    of the Formation of an Organising Committee and the Convening of the
    Third Regular Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
    Party” show how Lenin directed the preparations for the Third
    Party Congress and the establishment of the Bureau

    

    of Majority Committees and the Bolshevik newspaper
    Vperyod.
  

    The following documents published in this volume are included in the
    Collected Works for the first time: the “Statement
    Concerning Martov's Report”, the letter “To the
    Editorial Board of the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P." concerning
    Lenin's resignation from the editorial board of Iskra, the
    draft resolution moved in the Party Council on the convening of the
    Third Party Congress, and Lenin's fourth speech there on the
    publication of Party literature, and the “Announcement of the
    Formation of a Bureau of Majority Committees”.

This account is intended for personal acquaintances only, and
therefore to read it without the consent of the author
(Lenin)
      is tantamount to reading other people’s letters.


      In order to make what follows more intelligible, I shall first
      say a few words about the composition of the Congress, although
      it will mean anticipating somewhat. The number of votes at the
      Congress was fifty-one (thirty-three delegates with one vote
      each, and nine with two, nine

 “double-handers").[8]

      There were ten delegates, if I am not mistaken, with a
      deliberative voice but no vote; that is, fifty-two persons in
      all. The political grouping of these votes, as revealed during
      the entire course of the Congress, was as follows:

      five

 Bundists,[9]
      three Rabocheye

Dyelo-ists[10]

      (two from the Union of Russian Social-Democrats

 Abroad[11]
      and one from the St. Petersburg League of

 Struggle[12]
      four Yuzhny Rabochy-ists (two from the Yuzhny
Rabochy

 group[13]
      and two from the Kharkov
      Committee, which sided solidly with Yuzhny Rabochy), six
      indecisives or waverers (the “Marsh”, as they were called
      by all the

 Iskra-ists[14]—in
      jest, of
      course), and, lastly, about thirty-three Iskra-ists who
      were more or less firm and consistent in their
      Iskra-ism. These thirty- three Iskra-ists, who
      when they stood together decided every issue at the Congress,
      split in their turn into two subgroups—a split that took
      shape finally only towards the end of the Congress: one
      subgroup, with approximately nine votes, consisting of
      Iskra-ists of the “soft or rather zigzag line” (or
      the female line, as certain wits called it, and not without
      reason)—Iskra-ists who stood (as will be seen later) for
      justice, for a middle course, etc.; and the other, with about
      twenty-four votes, consisting of Iskra-ists of the firm
      line, who upheld consistent Iskra-ism both as

    

      regards tactics and as regards the personal composition of the
      central institutions of the Party.
     

      I repeat that this grouping took final shape and became quite
      clear only post factum, towards the end of the Congress
      (which held close on forty sittings!), and I am anticipating
      when I outline it at the start. I must also make the
      reservation that this grouping only represents the
      approximate numbers of votes, for on various minor issues
      (and on one occasion—on the question of “equality of
      languages”, of which I shall speak later—on a major
      issue too) the votes not infrequently split, some delegates
      abstaining, the groups intermingling, and so on.
     

      The composition of the Congress had been preliminarily
      determined by the Organising

 Committee,[15]
      which, under the
      Regulations for the Congress, had the right to invite to it in a
      deliberative capacity such persons as it might think fit. The
      Congress itself at the very beginning elected a Credentials
      Committee, which thereafter took charge of all matters relating
      to its composition. (Let me say in parenthesis that on this
      committee too there was a Bundist, who tried to take all the
      other members of it by siege, keeping them up until three
      o’clock in the morning, and who, even so, entered a
      “dissenting opinion” on every issue.)
     

      The Congress was marked at the beginning by the peaceful and
      harmonious co-operation of all the Iskra-ists; there had
      always been different shades of opinion among them, of course,
      but they had never manifested themselves as political
      differences. Incidentally, let us state in advance that the
      split among the Iskra-ists was one of the major political
      results of the Congress, and anyone who wants to acquaint
      himself with the matter should therefore pay special attention
      to all episodes even remotely connected with that split.
     

      One rather important event at the very beginning of the Congress
      was the election of the Bureau, or Presidium.
      Martov was for electing nine persons, who would select three
      from their number to act as the Bureau at each sitting, and he
      even suggested a Bundist as one of the nine. I was for electing
      only three persons for the whole duration of the Congress, and
      three, moreover, who would “keep order”. The Bureau
      elected consisted of Plekhanov, myself and

    

      Comrade

 T[16]
      (a firm-line Iskra-ist and member
      of the Organising Committee, of whom we shall have frequent
      occasion to speak later). The last-named, I might remark, was
      elected by only a narrow margin in preference to a Yuzhny
      Rabochy-ist (also a member of the Organising Committee). My
      difference with Martov over the question of the Bureau (a
      difference significant in the light of subsequent events) did
      not, however, lead to any split or conflict: the matter was
      somehow settled in a peaceful, natural, “homely”
      way, as most questions generally were settled in the
      Iskra organisation and the Iskra editorial board.
     

      Also at the beginning of the Congress, there was a meeting of
      the Iskra organisation (confidential and informal, of
      course) on the subject of its Congress mandates. This meeting
      likewise settled its business in a peaceful and amicable
      manner. I only mention this meeting because I think it
      significant, firstly, that at the beginning of the Congress the

      Iskra-ists worked together harmoniously, and, secondly,
      that they had decided to appeal, in doubtful and debatable
      cases, to the authority of the Iskra organisation (or,
      rather, of the Iskra organisation members present at the
      Congress); although the decisions of these meetings were not
      binding, of course, for the rule that “binding
      instructions are abolished” and that it was everyone’s
      right, and indeed duty, to vote at the Congress according to his
      own free convictions, without owing obedience to any
      organisation—this rule, I say, was recognised by all the
      Iskra-ists, and was loudly proclaimed by the chairman at
      the beginning of practically every meeting of the Iskra
      organisation.
     

      To proceed. The first incident at the Congress to disclose that
      all was not well among the Iskra-ists, an incident that
      “set the scene” for the final drama (or
      tragicomedy?), was the celebrated "incident of the
      Organising Committee”. This must be dealt with at length. It
      occurred while the Congress was still engaged in constituting
      itself and discussing its Standing Orders (which, by the way,
      consumed a tremendous amount of time on account of the
      obstruction of the Bundists, who, deliberately or otherwise,
      never missed an opportunity to cause delay). The substance of
      the Organising Committee incident was that, on the one hand,
      that body had, even before the Congress opened, rejected the
      protest of the Borba

    

 group,[17]
      which demanded representation at the
      Congress, and had stood by this decision in the Credentials
      Committee; and, on the other hand, on the floor of the
      Congress this same Organising Committee suddenly declared
      that it was inviting Ryazanov in a deliberative capacity. The
      course of events in regard to this incident was as follows.
     

      Before the sittings of the Congress began, Martov confidentially
      informed me that a certain member of the
      Iskra organisation and of the Organising Committee (whom
      we shall call

 N[18])
      had decided to insist in the
      Organising Committee that it invite to the Congress in a
      deliberative capacity a certain individual whom Martov himself
      could not describe otherwise than as a

 “renegade”.[19]
      (And it was true that this
      individual had inclined at one time towards Iskra but
      afterwards, within a few weeks, in fact, had gone over to
      Rabocheye Dyelo, even though the latter was already in a
      state of complete degeneration.) Martov and I discussed the
      matter and we were both indignant that a member of the
      Iskra organisation should do such a thing, knowing, of
      course (for Martov had warned Comrade N), that it was a direct
      slap in the face for Iskra, yet not considering it necessary even
      to consult the organisation. N did in fact put forward his
      proposal in the Organising Committee, but it was rejected owing
      to the vigorous protest of Comrade T, who described the wholly
      unstable political character of the “renegade”. It
      is worth noting that Martov, as he said, could not even speak
      any longer to N, although they had previously been on friendly
      personal terms, so shocked was he by this action. N’s wish to
      put spokes in Iskra’s wheel was further revealed in his
      supporting a vote of censure passed by the Organising Committee
      on the Iskra editorial board; a censure which, to be
      sure, concerned a very minor matter, but which nevertheless
      aroused Martov’s profound indignation. Furthermore, information
      from Russia, also communicated to me by Martov, indicated a
      tendency on N’s part to circulate rumours of dissension between
      the Iskra-ists in Russia and the Iskra-ists
      abroad. All this disposed the Iskra ists to be very
      distrustful of N; and on top of it all came the following. The
      Organising Committee had rejected the pro test of Borba; the
      Organising Committee members attending the meeting of the
      Credentials Committee (T and N) had

    

      both (including N!!!) likewise spoken in the most
      emphatic terms against Borba. Yet during an adjournment at one
      of the morning sittings of the Congress, the Organising Commit
      tee suddenly held a meeting of their own “by the
      window” and decided to invite Ryazanov in a deliberative
      capacity! N was   i n   f a v o u r   of
      inviting him.

      T, of course, was categorically against, declaring moreover
      that the Organising Committee had no right to make such a
      decision inasmuch as everything relating to the composition of
      the Congress had already been referred to the Credentials
      Committee specially elected by the Congress for the purpose. Of
      course, the Yuzhny Rabochy members of the Organising
      Committee+ the Bundist+N outvoted Comrade T, and the decision
      went through.
     

      T reported this decision to the Iskra editorial board,
      which (not all its members were present, but Martov and Zasulich
      were) unanimously decided, of course, to take the field at the
      Congress against the Organising Committee, for many
      Iskra-ists bad already spoken publicly at the Congress
      against Borba and it was impossible to yield on this issue.
     

      When the Organising Committee (after the dinner interval)
      informed the Congress of its decision, T, in his turn, informed
      it of his protest. Thereupon a Yuzhny Rabochy member of
      the Organising Committee fell upon T and accused him of
      violating discipline (!), on the grounds that the
      Organising Committee had resolved not to disclose (sic!)
      this fact to the Congress. Naturally, we (Plekhanov,
      Martov and I) came down hard on the Organising Committee
      at
      that, accusing it of reviving binding instructions, violating
      the sovereignty of the Congress, and so on. The Congress
      supported us, the Organising Committee was defeated, and a
      resolution was adopted depriving the Organising Committee as a
      body of the right to influence the composition of the Congress.
     

      Such was the “Organising Committee
      incident”. Firstly, it finally undermined the political
      confidence of many Iskra-ists in N (and strengthened
      their confidence in T); secondly, it not only proved, but
      palpably demonstrated how shaky the Iskra trend
      still was even in a central and, as it seemed, super-Iskra-ist
      institution like the Organising


    

      Committee. It became clear that, besides the Bundist, the
      Organising Committee included 1) Yuzhny Rabochy-ists with
      their own specific policy, and 2)

      “Iskra-ists who were ashamed of being
      Iskra-ists”, and that only some of its members
      were 3) Iskra-ists who were not ashamed of being
      such. When the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists expressed a desire to
      discuss this deplorable incident with the Iskra editorial
      board (privately, of
      course)—Comrade N, it is very
      important to note, expressed no desire at that time to do
      so—the
      editorial board did discuss It with them, and I
      plainly told them that the Congress had definitely revealed an
      important political fact, namely, that there were many
      Iskra-ists in the Party who were ashamed of being
      Iskra ists and were capable, just to spite Iskra,
      of playing such a trick as inviting Ryazanov. So angry was I at
      this trick on N’s part, after he had spoken against Borba
      in the committee, that I publicly declared at the Congress that
      “comrades who have attended foreign congresses know what
      a storm of indignation is always aroused when people say one
      thing at committees and. another on the floor of the

 Congress”.[1]
"Iskra-ists” who were afraid of
      being “reproached” by the Bundists with being
      “Iskra puppets”, and who for this reason
      alone played political tricks on Iskra,
      naturally could not inspire any confidence.
     

      The Iskra-ists’ general distrust of N grew immensely when
      Martov’s attempt to discuss the matter with him resulted in
      N’s announcing his resignation from the “Iskra”
      organisation!! Thereafter the N “affair” was
      taken up in the Iskra organisation, whose members were
      outraged by such a resignation, and the organisation
      held four meetings on the subject. These meetings,
      especially the last, are extremely important, for it was there
      that the split among the Iskra-ists, chiefly over
      the composition of the Central Committee, definitely took shape.
     

      But before embarking on an account of these meetings of the
      Iskra organisation (which, I once more repeat, were
      private and informal), let me say something about the work of
      the Congress. That work proceeded harmoniously for the time
      being, in the sense of all the Iskra-ists acting
      together,

    

      both on the first agenda item (the position of the Bund in the
      Party), and on the second (the programme), and on the third
      (endorsement of the Central Organ of the Party). The united
      stand of the Iskra-ists ensured a big and solid majority
      at the Congress (a compact majority, as the Bundists ruefully
      called it!), although here too the “indecisives” (or
      “Marsh") and Yuzhny Rabochy-ists more than once
      displayed, on minor issues, their utter instability. The
      political grouping of not fully Iskra-ist elements at the
      Congress stood out more and more clearly.
     

      To return to the meetings of the Iskra organisation. At
      the first of them it was resolved to request N to give an
      explanation, leaving it to him to say before whom of the members
      of the Iskra organisation he wished to do so. I protested
      emphatically against this approach, demanding that the political
      issue (the Iskra-ists’ lack of political confidence in N
      at this Congress) be separated from the personal issue (the
      appointment of a commission to investigate the reasons for N’s
      strange conduct). At the second meeting it was announced that N
      wished to give his explanation without T present,
      although he did not intend, he intimated, to say anything about
      T personally. I again pro tested and refused to be present at an
      explanation at which a non-member of the organisation could
      demand the withdrawal, even for a moment, of a member, when it
      was not that member he was going to discuss.I considered this an
      unworthy manoeuvre and a slap in the face for the organisation
      on N’s part: N did not even trust the organisation so far as to
      leave it to it to determine under what conditions the
      explanation should be given! At the third meeting, N gave his
      “explanation”, which failed to satisfy
      the majority of those present. The fourth meeting was attended
      by all the Iskra-ists; but it
      was   p r e c e d e d  
      by a number of important episodes at the Congress itself.
     

      First of all, mention should be made of the “equality of
      languages” episode. It concerned the adoption of the pro
      gramme—the formulation of the demand for equality and
      equal rights in regard to language. (The programme was discussed
      and voted on point by point, the Bundists engaged in desperate
      obstruction, and practically two-thirds of the time of the
      Congress was spent on the programme!) On

    

      this issue the Bundists succeeded in shaking the unity of the
      Iskra-ists, leading some of them to believe that
      Iskra objected to “equality of languages”,
      when actually all the Iskra editorial board objected to
      was this illiterate, in its opinion, bizarre and superfluous
      formula. A desperate struggle ensued, and the Congress was split
      in half, into two equal halves (with a few
      abstentions): about twenty-three votes (perhaps 23-25, 1 do not
      remember exactly) were on the side of Iskra (and the
      Iskra editorial board), and as many were against. The
      question had to be postponed, it was referred back to the
      committee, which found a formula that the Congress adopted
       
      u n a n i m o u s l y. The equality of

      languages incident is important because it once more revealed
      the shakiness of Iskra-ism, plainly and definitely
      revealed the shakiness both of the indecisives (it was then, if
      I am not mistaken, that they were dubbed the Marsh, and
      by none other than the Iskra-ists of the Martov
      persuasion!) and of the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists, who were all
      against Iskra. Passions ran high and innumerable
      cutting remarks were flung at the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists
      by the Iskra-ists, especially the Martovites. One
      “leader” of the Martovites nearly came to blows with
      the Yuzhny Rabochy ists during the interval, and I
      hastened to. resume the sitting (at the urgent request of
      Plekhanov, who feared a scuffle). It is important to note that
      among these twenty- three staunchest of the Iskra-ists
      too, the Martovites (i.e., the Iskra-ists who
      subsequently followed Martov) constituted
      a   m i n o r i t y.
     

      Another episode was the struggle over Paragraph I of the
      “Party Rules”. This was already the fifth item of
      the

Tagesordnung,[2]

      towards the end of the
      Congress. (Under Item 1, a resolution against federalism was
      adopted; under Item 2, the programme; under Item 3, Iskra
      was adopted as the Central Organ of the

Party;[3]

      under Item 4,
      the “delegates’

    

      reports” were heard, part of them, that is, the rest being
      referred to a committee, for the time at the disposal of the
      Congress was already too short—both funds and endurance
      had been exhausted.)
     

      Paragraph 1 of the Rules defines a Party member. The
      definition given in my draft was: “A member of the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who accepts its pro gramme
      and who supports the Party both financially and by personal
      participation in one of the Party organisations." In
      place of the words I have underlined, Martov proposed:

      “work under the control and direction of one of the
      Party organisations”. My formulation was supported by
      Plekhanov, Martov’s by the rest of the editorial board (Axelrod
      was their spokesman at the Congress). We argued that the concept
      Party member must be narrowed so as to separate
      those who worked from those who merely talked, to eliminate
      organisational chaos, to eliminate the monstrous and absurd
      possibility of there being organisations which consisted of
      Party members but which were not Party organisations, and so
      on. Martov stood for broadening the Party and spoke of a
      broad class movement needing a broad—i.e., diffuse—
      organisation, and so forth. It is amusing to note that in
      defence of their views nearly all Martov’s supporters cited
      What Is To Be

Done?[4]

      Plekhanov hotly opposed Martov,
      pointing out that his Jauresist formulation would fling open the
      doors to the opportunists, who just longed for such a position
      of being inside the Party but outside its
      organisation. “Under the control and direction”, I
      said,
      would in

    

      practice mean nothing more nor less than without any control
      or direction. Martov won: his formulation was
      adopted (by about twenty-eight votes to twenty-three, or
      something like that—I cannot recall exactly),
      thanks to the Bund, which, of course, at once sensed a
      loophole and brought all its five votes to bear to
      secure the adoption of “the worse alternative” (that
      is precisely how a Rabocheye Dyelo delegate explained
      his motive for voting for Martov!). The heated controversy and
      the voting on Paragraph I of the Rules once more revealed the
      political grouping at the Congress and demonstrated that the
      Bund+Rabocheye Dyelo could decide the fate of
      any issue by supporting the minority of the Iskra-ists
      against the majority.
     

      It was after the debate and voting on Paragraph I of
      the Rules that the fourth (and last) meeting of the
      Iskra organisation took place. The disagreement among
      the Iskra-ists over the personal composition of the
      Central Committee had already become quite clear and had caused
      a split in their ranks: one section stood for an
      Iskra-ist Central Committee (in view of the dissolution
      of the Iskra organisation and the Emancipation of
      Labour

 group[20]
      and the need to complete Iskra’s work), the
      other—for admitting the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists too
      and for predominance of Iskra-ists of the “zigzag
      line”. The first section was categorically against N’s
      candidature, the other in favour of it. It was in a last attempt
      to reach agreement that this meeting of the sixteen
      (members of the Iskra organisation, including, I
      repeat, those present in a deliberative capacity) was
      called. The result of the voting was: nine against N, four in
      favour, the rest abstaining. The majority, anxious nonetheless
      to avoid war with the minority, thereupon proposed a compromise
      list of five, including one Yuzhny Rabochy-ist
      (acceptable to the minority) and one militant member of the
      minority, while the rest were consistent Iskra-ists (of
      whom—it is important to note—one joined in the fight
      at the Congress only towards the end and was to all intents and
      purposes impartial, while the other two took no part at all in
      the fight and were absolutely impartial as regards
      personalities). Ten hands were raised for this list (then one
      more was added, making eleven) and one against (only Martov’s!),
      the rest abstained! Thus the compromise

    

      list was wrecked by Martov. After this, two
      “militant” lists, one from each side, were put to
      the vote, but neither secured more than a minority.
     

      And so, at the last meeting of the Iskra organisation
      the Martovites proved in the minority on both issues;
      nevertheless, when a member of the majority (the
      above-mentioned impartial member, or chairman) approached them
      after the meeting in a last attempt to reach agreement, they
      declared war.
     

      The Martovites’ calculation was clear and sure: the
      Bundists and Rabocheye Dyelo-ists would undoubtedly
      have supported the list of the zigzag line, for during
      the month the Congress had been sitting all issues had become so
      plain and all personalities so clearly delineated that not
      one of the Congress delegates would have had any difficulty
      in deciding which was the better alternative, or the lesser
      evil. And for the Bund+Rabocheye Dyelo, of course, the
      zigzag Iskra-ists were the lesser evil, and always will
      be.
     

After the meeting of the sixteen, when the
      Iskra-ists had definitely divided and war had been
      declared among them, meetings began of the two parties into
      which the Congress had split, that is, private and unofficial
      gatherings of all who thought alike. The Iskra-ists of
      the consistent line assembled at first to the number of nine
      (out of sixteen), then fifteen, and finally
      twenty-four, counting votes, not persons. This
      rapid increase was due to the fact that the lists of candidates
      (for the Central Committee) were already beginning to circulate,
      and the vast majority of the Iskra ists were
      immediately and permanently repelled by the Martovite lists
      because of their flabbiness: Martov’s candidates were people
      who had made a definitely bad impression on the Congress (by
      paltering, inconsistency, tactlessness, etc.). That in the first
      place; in the second place, when it was explained to the
      Iskra-ists what had taken place in the Iskra
      organisation, the bulk of them were drawn towards the majority,
      and Martov’s inability to stick to a definite political line
      became apparent to all and sundry. So it was that twenty-four
      votes were quickly and easily mustered for the consistent
      Iskra-ist tactics, for the list of Central Committee
      candidates, and for electing a trio to the

    

      editorial board (instead of endorsing the old, ineffectual and
      amorphous board of six).
     

      By this time the Congress had finished discussing the Rules, and
      Martov and Co. had once again (and not once, in fact, but
      several times) defeated the majority of the
      Iskra-ists with the generous assistance of the
      Bund+“Rabocheye Dyelo”—as, for example, over the
      question of co-optation to the central bodies (this question was
      decided by the Congress along Martov’s lines).
     

      In spite of having been thus impaired, the Rules as a whole were
      endorsed by all the Iskra-ists and by the entire
      Congress. But after the general Rules, the Congress passed on to
      the Rules of the Bund, and by an overwhelming majority
      rejected the Bund’s proposal (to recognise the Bund as the
      sole representative of the Jewish proletariat in the
      Party). I think on this issue the Bund stood alone against
      practically the whole Congress. Thereupon the Bundists
      withdrew from the Congress, announcing their withdrawal from the
      Party. The Martovites had lost five of their faithful
      allies! Then the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists too withdrew,
      after the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy

 Abroad[21]
      was recognised as the sole Party
      organisation abroad. The Martovites had lost another two of
      their faithful allies! The total number of votes at the Congress
      was now forty- four (51—7), of which the majority
      (twenty-four) were those of consistent Iskra-ists; the
      coalition of the Martovites with the Yuzhny
      Rabochy-ists and the “Marsh” resulted in only
      twenty votes.
     

      The Iskra-ists of the zigzag line were faced with the
      prospect of submitting—just as the Iskra-ists of
      the firm line had submitted without a murmur when Martov set
      out to beat and did beat them in coalition with the
      Bund. But the Martovites were so unbridled that instead of
      submitting they set out to cause a row and a split.
     

      It was causing a row to raise the question of endorsing the old
      editorial board, for the request of even one of the editors
      would be enough to oblige the Congress to scrutinise
      the question of the composition of the Central Organ in its
      entirety, instead of confining itself to mere endorsement. It
      was a step towards a split to refuse to take part in
      the elections to the Central Organ and the Central Committee.
     
 

      First as regards the election of the editorial board. As I have
      already mentioned, what the Tagesordnung said, in Item
      24, was: election of the central institutions of the
      Party. And my commentary on the

 Tagesordnung[22]

      (which commentary was known to
  a l l  
the
      “Iskra”-ists long before the Congress and to all
      the delegates at the Congress) said marginally: election of

      
        t h r e e  
p e r s o n s  
t o  
t h e  
C e n t r a l  
0 r g a n  

      and three
      to the Central Committee. Hence it is beyond all doubt that the
      demand for the election of a trio originated within the
      editorial board itself and none of the editors
      protested against it. Even Martov and another Martovite leader
      defended the proposal for “two trios” prior to the
      Congress, before a number of delegates.
     

      Several weeks before the Congress, I personally informed

 Starover[23]
      and Martov that at the Congress I would demand
      the election of the editorial board; I agreed to the
      election of two trios, the idea being that the editorial trio
      would either co-opt seven (or even more) persons
      or would remain as it was (I specially stipulated this
      latter possibility). Starover even said outright that the trio
      would mean Plekhanov+Martov+Lenin, and I agreed
      with him—so clear had it been to everyone all along that
      these alone could be elected to the leadership. One had to be
      actuated by resentment and pique and lose one’s head after the
      struggle at the Congress to proceed after the event to attack
      the trio as inexpedient and ineffectual. The old board of six
      was so ineffectual that never once in all its three
      years did it meet in full force. That may seem incredible,
      but it is a fact. Not one of the forty-five issues of
      Iskra was made up (in the editorial and technical
      sense) by anyone but Martov or Lenin. And never once
      was any major theoretical issue raised by anyone but
      Plekhanov. Axelrod did no work at all (he contributed literally
      nothing to

 Zarya[24]
      and only three or
      four articles to all the forty-five issues of Iskra).
      Zasulich and Starover only contributed and advised, they
      never did any actual editorial work. Who ought to be
      elected to the political leadership, to the

      
       c e n t r e,  

      was as clear as daylight to every delegate at the
      Congress, after the month it had been in session.
     

      To propose at the Congress to endorse the old editorial board
      was a stupid attempt to provoke a row.
     
 

      It was stupid because it was futile. Even if the board of six
      had been endorsed, one member of it (myself, for example) would
      have demanded that it be reviewed, that the relations within it
      be examined, and the Congress would have been obliged to go into
      the matter all over again.
     

      It was an attempt to provoke a row because
      non-endorsement was bound to be taken

      
        a s   a n  
i n s u l t—whereas

      in a new election there was nothing insulting
      whatever. The Central Committee was being elected—why not
      the Central Organ too? There was no question of endorsing the
      Organising Committee—why should there be any of endorsing
      the old editorial board?
     

      Naturally, however, by demanding endorsement the
      Martovites provoked a protest at the Congress, the
      protest
      was taken as an insult, as an affront, as an attempt to
      oust them, to shut them out ... and all the bogy-tales
      began to be invented on which the fancy of idle gossips is now
      feeding!
     

      The editorial board left the hail while the Congress discussed
      the election-or-endorsement issue. After a desperately hot
      debate, the Congress decided


 
n o t   t o  
e n d o r s e  
t h e   o l d  
e d i t o r i a l
 

 b o a r d.[5]


      Only after this decision was taken did the ex-members of the
      editorial board return to the hall. Martov then got up and, in
      his own name and that of his colleagues, declined to
      stand for election, uttering all sorts of dreadful and wretched
      words about a “state of siege in the Party” (for
      blackballed Ministers?) and “emergency laws against
      particular individuals and groups” (such as those who, in
      the
      name of Iskra, try to palm off Ryazanov on it, and who
      say one thing at committees and another on the floor of the
      Congress?).
     

      I replied to him by pointing to the incredible confusion of
      political ideas which had led to this protest against
      election, against the Congress making changes in official Party

 bodies.[6]

 

      Plekhanov, Martov, and Lenin were elected. Martov again
      declined. Koltsov (who received three votes) likewise
      declined. Thereupon the Congress passed a resolution instructing
      the two members of the editorial board of the Central Organ to
      co-opt a third, when they should find a suitable person.
     

      Next came the election of three members to the Central
      Committee—the name of only one of whom was disclosed
      to the Congress by the teller of the votes—and of the
      fifth member of the Party

 Council[25]
      (likewise
      by secret ballot).
     

      The Martovites, followed by the whole of the
      “Marsh”, would not hand in their ballots
      and submitted a written statement to the Bureau to that effect.
     

      This was manifestly a step towards a split, towards wrecking
      the Congress and refusing to recognise the Party. Yet when
      one of the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists said in so many words
      that he doubted (sic!) the validity of the Congress
      decisions, Martov, overcome by shame, controverted him,
      publicly declaring that he had no doubt as to their
      validity.
     

      Unfortunately, these well-spoken and loyal words have been
      contradicted by the actions and behaviour of Martov (and of the
      Martovites)....
     

      The Congress then entrusted the publication of the minutes to a
      Minutes Committee, and adopted eleven resolutions on tactical
      questions, viz.:
     
1) On Demonstrations; 
2) On the Trade Union Movement; 
3) On Work Among the Sects; 
4) On Work Among the Student Youth; 
5) On How To Behave Under Interrogation; 
6) On Shop Stewards; 
7) On the 1904 International Congress in Amsterdam; 
8) On the Pberals (Starover’s resolution); 
9) On the Pberals (Plekhanov’s resolution); 
10) On the

 Socialist-Revolutionaries[26]; 
11) On Party Pterature. 

      Then, after a brief speech reminding the delegates that the
      decisions of the Congress were binding, the chairman closed the
      Congress.
     

 


      Examining the behaviour of the Martovites since the Congress,
      their refusal to collaborate on the Central Organ (although
      officially invited by the editorial board to do so), their
      refusal to work on the Central Committee, and their
      propaganda of a boycott—all I can say is that this is an
      insensate attempt, unworthy of Party members, to disrupt the
      Party—and why? Only because they are dissatisfied
      with the composition of the central bodies; for, speaking
      objectively, it was o n 1 y over this that our
      ways parted, while their subjective verdicts (insult, affront,
      slurs, ousting, shutting out, etc., etc.) are nothing but
      the fruits of offended vanity and a morbid imagination.
     

      This morbid imagination and offended vanity are leading directly
      to the most disgraceful scandal-mongering, when,
      without yet knowing or seeing anything of the activities of
      the new central bodies, people spread rumours about their
      being “ineffectual”, about Ivan Ivanovich
      “ruling with a rod of iron” or Ivan

 Nikiforovich[27]
      with an “iron hand”, and
      so on.
     

      To try to prove that the central bodies are
      “ineffectual” by boycotting them is an
      unprecedented and unparalleled violation of Party duty,
      and no sophistry can conceal the fact: the boycott is a step
      towards disrupting the Party.
     

      The Russian Social-Democratic movement is in the throes of the
      last difficult transition from the circles to a Party,
      from philistinism to a realisation of revolutionary
      duty, from acting by means of scandal-mongering and circle
      pressure to discipline.
     

      Anyone who values Party work and action in the
      interests of the Social-Democratic labour movement will refuse
      to tolerate such wretched sophistries as a
      “legitimate” and “loyal” boycott of the
      central bodies; he will not allow the cause to suffer and the
      work to be brought to a standstill because a dozen or so
      individuals are displeased that they and their friends were not
      elected to the central bodies; he will not allow Party
      officials to be subjected to private and secret pressure through
      threats of non-collaboration, through boycotts, through cutting
      off of funds, through scandal-mongering and lying tales.

      It is highly important to note that the Congress
      Togesordnung, adopted, on my report, by the
Organising Committee and endorsed by the Congress,
      contained two separate items: Item 3:
      “Establishment of the Central Organ of the Party, or
      endorsement of such”, and Item 24: ’Election of
      the central institutions oi the Party”. WThen one of
      the Jioboeheye Dyelo-ists asked (in connection with
      Item 3) what it was

   

      we were endorsing, just a name?—we didn’t even know who
      the editors were to be!— Me r to v took the floor
      and explained that what was being submitted for endorsement was
      the Iskra   t r e n d, irrespective of persons, and
      that this would in no way predetermine the composition of the
      editorial board, for the election of the central institutions
      would follow under Item 24, and all binding instructions had
      been abolished.
     

      These words of Martov’s (on Item 3, be lore the
      “Iskra"-ists had split) are of the utmost importance.
     

      The explanation Martov gave fully accorded with our
      common understanding of the meaning of Item 3 and Item 24
      of the Tagesor dnung .
     

      After Item 3 Martov in his speeches at the Congress actually
      employed, time and again, the expression: the ex-members of the
      Iskra editorial board.

      One Martovite made such a speech on
      this occasion that when he had finished a delegate called out to
      the secretary: “Don’t put a full stop, put a tear-drop!"
      Particularly fervent in their championship of the old editorial
      board were the mast inveterate “Marsh” men.

      The Account of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
      written at the time of the Bolsheviks’ bitter struggle against
      the disruptive, splitting activities of the Mensheviks after the
      Second Congress, played a big part in exposing the Mensheviks’
      opportunist tactics and rallying the supporters of the
      majority. Until the publication of the Congress minutes (in
      January 1904) it was the only Party document dealing with the
      results of the Second Congress and the causes of the split in
      the Part.y. The ideas contained in it were further developed in
      subsequent articles, letters, and speeches by Lenin, and
      particularly in his book One Step Forward, Two Steps
      Back.

      Lenin here gives the figures of voting rights as they stood at
      the time of the Credentials Committee report at the second
      sitting of the Congress, on July 18 (31), 1903. 42 voting
      delegates had arrived at the Congress by then: 33 with one vote
      each, 8 with two votes each, and one of the two delegates from
      the Foreign Committee of the Bund also had two votes
      temporarily, pending the arrival of the other. After the arrival
      of this latter on July 22 (August 4), there were 43 voting
      delegates, 35 of them with one vote each and 8 with two.

      The Bund (General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania,
      Poland, and Russia), founded at a congress of Jewish
      Social-Democratic groups held in Vilno in 1897, was an
      association mainly of semi-proletarian Jewish artisans in
      Russia’s western regions. It joined the R.S.D.L.P. at the First
      Congress (1898) “as an autonomous organisation independent
      only in regard to questions specifically concerning the Jewish
      proletariat” (The C.P.S.U. in Resolutions and
      Decisions of Its Congresses, Conferences, and Plenary Meetings
      of the Central Committee, 1954, Part I, p. 14).
     

      The Bund brought nationalist and separatist tendencies into the
      Russian working-class movement. Its Fourth Congress, in April
      1901, voted to replace the autonomy relationship established by
      the First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. by a relationship based on
      the federal principle. This congress of the Bund also declared,
      in a resolution on methods of political struggle, that
      “the best way to draw the broad masses into the movement
      is the economic struggle”.
     

      After the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. rejected its demand
      to be recognised as the sole representative of the Jewish
      proletariat, the Bund withdrew from the Party. It rejoined in
      1900 on the basis of a decision of the Fourth (Unity) Congress.
     


      Within the R.S.D.L.P., the Bundists always supported the
      opportunist wing (the Economists, the Mensheviks, the
      Liquidators)
      and fought against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism. As against the
      Bolsheviks’ programme demand for the right of nations to self-
      determination, they called for national cultural
      autonomy. During the First World War the Bund took a
      social-chauvinist stand. In 1917 it supported the
      counter-revolutionary Provisional Government and fought on the
      side of the enemies of the Great October Socialist
      Revolution. In the years of foreign military intervention and
      civil war the Bund leadership joined forces with the counter
      revolution. At the same time, the Bund rank and file began to
      show a change of heart and favour co-operation with the Soviet
      government. In March 1921 the Bund dissolved itself, part of
      its member ship joining the Communist Party on the basis of the
      general rules
      of admission.

Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause) was an Economist
      journal, organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad,
      published at irregular intervals in Geneva from April 1899 be
      February 1902 under the editorship of B. N. Krichevsky,
      P. F. Teplov (Sibiryak), V. P. Ivanshin, and later
      A. S. Martynov. Nine issues (three of them double ones, thus
      making twelve) appeared in all. The editorial board of
      Rabocheye Dyelo was the Economists’ centre abroad. It
      supported Bernstein’s slogan of “freedom of
      criticism” of Marxism, took an opportunist stand on the
      tactical and organisational problems of the Russian
      Social-Democratic movement, and denied the revolutionary
      potentialities of the peasantry. The journal propagated the
      opportunist idea of subordinating the workers’ political
      struggle to the economic and glorified spontaneity in the
      working-class movement, denying the leading role of the
      Party. One of its editors, V. P. Ivanshin, also took part in
      editing Rabochaya Mysl, organ of the avowed
      Economists, which Rabocheye Dyelo supported. At the
      Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., the Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ists represented the extreme Right, opportunist
      wing of the Party.
     



[11]

      The Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was
      founded in 1894 in Geneva, on the initiative of the Emancipation
      of Labour group. The latter was at first the leader in it and
      edited its publications; but afterwards the opportunist
      elements—the Economist “younger group"—secured
      the upper hand. At the Union’s First Congress in November 1898
      the Emancipation of Labour group refused to edit the Union
      publications; and at the Second Congress, in April 1900, it
      broke with the Union finally, withdrawing with its supporters
      from the Congress to establish an independent organisation
      called Sotsial-Demokrat.




[12]

      The League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working
      Class, organised by Lenin in the autumn of 1895, embraced
      some twenty Marxist workers’ study circles in St. Petersburg and
      was beaded by a Central Group led by Lenin. It was the first
      organisation in Russia

   

      to link up socialism with the working-class movement, going over
      from the propagation of Marxism among a small number of advanced
      workers to political agitation among the broad masses of the
      proletariat; it was significant because, as Lenin put it, it was
      the rudiment of a revolutionary party based on the working-class
      movement and directing the class struggle of the proletariat.
     

      On the night of December 8 (20), 1895, the League was dealt a
      severe blow: many of the leading members, headed by Lenin, were
      arrested. The first issue of its paper Rabocheye Dyelo
      (Workers’ Cause), all ready for the press, was also seized.
     

      While in prison Lenin continued to direct the work of the
      League; he helped it with advice, smuggled out coded letters and
      leaflet texts, and wrote the pamphlet On Strikes
      (unfortunately not found so far) and his “Draft and
      Explanation of a Programme for the Social-Democratic
      Party” (present edition, Vol. 2, pp. 93-121).
     

      Those of the old League members who escaped arrest helped to
      prepare and arrange the First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and to
      draw up the Manifesto issued in its name. however, the long
      absence of the League’s founders, who had been exiled to
      Siberia, and above all of Lenin, gave freer scope to the
      opportunist policies of the Economist “younger
      group” of Social-Democrats, who from 1897 on preached
      through their newspaper Rabochaya Mysl the ideas of
      mere trade unionism and Bernsteinism. Beginning with the latter
      half of 1898 the leadership of the League was in the hands of
      the extreme Economists of the Rabochaya Mysl
      persuasion.
     



[13]

Yuzhny Rabochy (Southern Worker) was a
      Social-Democratic group formed in the South of Russia in the
      autumn of 1900 around an illegal newspaper of that name (the
      first issue was published in January 1900 by the Ekaterinoslav
      Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., the twelfth and last—in April
      1903). Among the members of the group and the editors of the
      paper were, at various times, I. K. Lalayants, A. Vilensky,
      0. A. Kogan, B. S. Zeitlin, Y. Y. and Y. S. Levin, and
      V. N. Rozanov.
     

      In contrast to the Economists, the Yuzhny Rabochy group
      considered the proletariat’s political struggle, the overthrow
      of the autocracy, to be the prime task; they opposed terrorism,
      upheld the need to develop a mass revolutionary movement, and
      carried out extensive revolutionary activities in the South of
      Russia. At the same time, they overestimated the role of the
      liberal bourgeoisie and ignored the importance of the peasant
      movement. As against the Iskra plan of building a
      centralised Marxist party by uniting all revolutionary
      Social-Democrats around Iskra, the Yuzhny
      Rabochy group advocated a plan of restoring the Party by
      creating regional Social-Democratic associations. A practical
      attempt to carry out this plan was made through convening in
      December 1901 a conference of the Party committees and
      organisations of the South, at which a League of Southern
      Committees and Organisations of the R.S.D.L.P. was formed, with
      Yuzhny Rabochy as its press organ. The attempt proved
      impracticable (as was the group’s entire organisational plan),
      and following wholesale arrests in the spring

   

      of 1902, the League fell to pieces. In August 1902 those
      Yuzhny Rabochy members who remained at liberty entered
      into negotiations with the Iskra editorial board about
      working together to restore Party unity. The group’s statement
      of solidarity with Iskra (published in No. 27 of
      Iskra, November 1,1902, and in No. 10 of Yuzhny
      Rabochy, December 1902) was of much importance in
      consolidating the Social-Democratic forces. In November 1902
      Yuzhny Rabochy joined with the Iskra
      organisation in Russia and the St. Petersburg Committee and
      Northern League of the R.S.D.L.P. in establishing the Organising
      Committee for convening the Second Party Congress, and they
      shared in that committee’s work. But in this period too the
      group did not adhere to the consistent revolutionary line and
      evinced separatist tendencies (proposing, for example, to set
      up another all-Russia newspaper in addition to Iskra).
      Lenin classed Yuzhny Rabochy among the organisations
      “which, while verbally recognising Iskra as the
      leading organ, actually pursued plans of their own and were
      unstable in matters of principle” (p. 211 of this
      volume). At the Second Party Congress the Yuzhny
      Rabochy delegates adopted a “Centre” position
      (that of “middling opportunists’, as Lenin called the
      “Centre").
     

      The Second Party Congress voted to dissolve Yuzhny
      Rabochy, like all other separate, independently existing
      Social-Democratic
      groups and organisations.
     



[14]

Iskra (The Spark) was the first
      all-Russia illegal Marxist newspaper; it was founded by Lenin
      in 1900, and it played a vital part in building the Marxist
      revolutionary party of the Russian working class.
     

      It was impossible to publish the paper in Russia on account of
      police persecution, and while still in exile in Siberia Lenin
      evolved a detailed plan for its publication abroad. When his
      term of exile ended (January 1900) he at once set about putting
      his plan into effect. In February he negotiated in
      St. Petersburg with V era Zasulich (who had come illegally from
      abroad) on the participation of the Emancipation of Labour
      group. At the end of March and be ginning of April, Lenin,
      Martov (Y. 0. Zederbaum), A. N. Potresov, and S. I. Badchenko
      held a conference in Pskov with the “legal Marxists”
      P. B. Struve and M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky; this conference
      discussed Lenin’s draft declaration of the editorial board of
      the all-Russia newspaper (Iskra) and theoretical and
      political journal (Zarya) on the programme and aims of
      these publications. Lenin also travelled to various cities
      (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Riga, Smolensk, Samara,
      Nizhni-Novgorod, Ufa, Syzran), establishing contacts with
      Social-Democratic groups and individual Social- Democrats and
      obtaining their support for Iskra. In August 1900, when
      Lenin arrived in Switzerland, he and Potresov held discussions
      with the Emancipation of Labour group on the programme and aims
      of Iskra and Zarya, on possible contributors,
      and on the membership and location of the editorial
      board. These negotiations very nearly ended in failure, but
      finally agreement was reached on all disputed questions.
     


      The first issue of Lenin’s Iskra appeared in December
      1900 in Leipzig; afterwards the paper was published in Munich,
      in London (from July 1902), and, beginning with the spring of
      1903, in Geneva. Considerable help in getting the paper going
      was afforded by the German Social-Democrats Clara Zetkin, Adolf
      Braun, and others, by the Polish revolutionary Julian
      Marchlewski, who was living in Munich at the time, and by Harry
      Quelch, one of the leaders of the British Social-Democratic
      Federation.
     

      The editorial board of Iskra consisted of Lenin,
      G. V. Plekhanov, Martov, P. B. Axelrod, Potresov, and Vera
      Zasulich. Its secretary in the initial days was
      I. G. Smidovich-Leman then, in the spring of 1901, the post was
      taken over by N. K. Krupskaya, who also conducted all
      Iskra’s correspondence with the Social-Democratic
      organisations in Russia. Lenin was actually editor-in-chief and
      the leading figure in Iskra. His articles in it dealt
      with all major issues in the work of building the Party and in
      the class struggle of the Russian proletariat, as well as with
      important developments in world affairs.
     

Iskra became the centre around which the unification of
      the Party proceeded and Party forces were mustered and
      trained. Party committees and groups adhering to Lenin’s
      Iskra line were formed In many places in Russia
      (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Samara, and others); and a conference
      of Iskra-ists held in Samara in January 1902 founded
      the Iskra Organisation in Russia. The
      Iskra-ist organisations grew up and worked under the
      immediate leader ship of Lenin’s associates and
      disciples—N. E. Bauman, I. V. Babushkin, S. I. Gusev,
      M. I. Kalinin, G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, and others. The paper
      played a decisive role in the fight for a Marxist party, in the
      defeat of the Economists and the unification of the scattered
      and isolated Social-Democratic circles.
     

      On the initiative and with the immediate participation of Lenin,
      the Iskra editorial hoard drafted the Party programme
      (the draft was published in Iskra, No. 21) and prepared
      the Second Party Congress, which was held in July-August
      1903. By the time of the Congress most of the local
      Social-Democratic organisations in Russia had associated
      themselves with Iskra, approved its programme, tactical
      line., and organisational plan, and recognised it as their
      leading organ. A special resolution of the Congress noted
      Iskra s exceptional role in the struggle to build the
      Party and adopted the paper as the Central Party Organ. The
      Congress appointed an editorial board consisting of Lenin,
      Plekhanov, and Martov; but Mar- toy, who insisted that all six
      of the old editors should be retained, refused to serve on the
      board, in spite of the Congress decision, and Nos. 46-51 of
      Iskra were edited by Lenin and Plekhanov. Subsequently
      Plekhanov went over to the Mensheviks and demand ed the
      co-optation to the board of all the old Menshevik editors whom
      the Congress had rejected. Lenin could not agree to this, and on
      October 19 (November 1), 1903, he resigned his editorship, he
      was co-opted to the Central Committee and struck at the
      Menshevik opportunists from this position. Issue No. 52 of
      Iskra was edited by Plekhanov alone. On November 13
      (26), 1903, Plekhanov,

   

      acting on his own and in violation of the will of the Congress,
      co-opted all the Menshevik ex-editors to the editorial
      board. Beginning with issue No. 52, Iskra became the
      organ of the Mensheviks.

      The Organising Committee for convening the Second
      Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was originally elected at the
      Belostok Conference held in March (April) 1902, but soon after
      the conference all the committee members but one were
      arrested. At Lenin’s suggestion, a new Organising Committee was
      set up at a conference of Social- Democratic committees held in
      November 1902 in Pskov. On this committee the
      Iskra-ists had an overwhelming majority.
     

      Under Lenin’s guidance, the Organising Committee carried out
      extensive preparatory work for the Second Congress. Draft
      Regulations for the convening of the Congress were adopted at a
      plenary session held in Orel in February 1903. Following this
      plenary session, members of the Organising Committee twice
      visited the local Party organisations with a view to assisting
      them in their work. With their participation, the local
      committees discussed the draft Regulations, after which the
      Organising Committee finally endorsed the Regulations and
      approved a list of the local organisations entitled under them
      to representation at the Congress.
     

      The Organising Committee prepared for the Congress a detailed
      written report on its activities.

T was the Bolshevik P. A. Krasikov (referred to in
      the Congress
      minutes as Paviovich).
     



[17]

Borba (Struggle) was a group of writers residing
      abroad, which considered itself part of the R.S.D.L.P.; it took
      shape as an independent group in Paris in 1901. Since it
      departed from Social- Democratic views and tactics, engaged in
      disorganising activities, and had no contacts with
      Social-Democratic organisations in Russia, the group was not
      allowed representation at the Second Party Congress. It was
      dissolved by decision of that Congress.
     



[18]

N or NN was the Menshevik
      Yekaterina Alexandrova (referred to
      in the Congress minutes as Stein).
     



[19]

      The “renegade” was
      I. V. Chernyshov: originally an Economist, he then went over to
      the Iskra organisation abroad but in April
      1903 again deserted to the Economists.
     



[20]

      The Emancipation of Labour group
      was the first Russian Marxist group; it was founded by
      G. V. Plekhanov in Geneva in 1883. Apart from Plekhanov, the
      members were P. B. Axelrod L. G. Deutscb, Vera Zasulich, and
      V. N. Ignatov.
     

      The Emancipation of Labour group did a great deal for the
      propagation of Marxism in Russia. They translated into Russian,
      published abroad, and distributed in Russia Marx’s and Engels’s
      Manifesto of the Communist Party, Marx’s
      Wage-Labour and Capital,

   

      Engels’s Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, and other
      works of the founders of Marxism; their work dealt a severe blow
      to Narodism. Plekhanov’s two drafts of a programme for Russian
      Social Democrats,written in 1883 and 1885 and published by
      the group,were an important step towards the formation of a
      Social-Democratic Party in Russia; and his essays Socialism
      and the Political Struggle (1883), Our Differences
      (1885), and The Development of the Monist View of
      History (1895) played a big part in spreading Marxist
      views. At the same time, however, the Emancipation of Labour
      group were guilty of serious errors; they clung to certain
      remnants of Narodnik views, underestimated the revolutionary
      capacity of the peasantry, and overestimated the role of the
      liberal bourgeoisie. These errors were the embryo of the future
      Menshevik views of Plekhanov and other members of the
      group. The Emancipation of Labour group had no practical ties
      with the working-class movement. Lenin pointed out that it
      “only founded Social-Democracy theoretically and took the
      first step in the direction of the working-class movement”
      (present edition, Vol. 20, “The Ideological Struggle in
      the Working-Class Movement").
     

      At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the Emancipation of
      Labour group proclaimed itself dissolved.
     



[21]

      The League of Russian Revolutionary
      Social-Democracy Abroad was founded in October
      1901 on Lenin’s initiative, incorporating the
      Iskra-Zarya organisation abroad and the
      Sotsial-Demokrat organisation (which included the
      Emancipation of Labour group). The objects of the League were to
      propagate the ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy and help
      to build a militant Social-Democratic organisation. Actually,
      the League was the foreign representative of the Iskra
      organisation. It recruited supporters for Iskra among
      Social-Democrats living abroad, gave the paper material support,
      organised its delivery to Russia, and published popular Marxist
      literature. The Second Party Congress endorsed the League as the
      sole Party organisation abroad, with the status of a Party
      committee and the obligation of working under the Central
      Committee’s direction and control.
     

      After the Second Party Congress, the Mensheviks entrenched
      themselves in the League and used it in their fight against
      Lenin and the Bolsheviks. At the Second Congress of the League,
      in October 1903, they adopted new League Rules that ran counter
      to the Party Rules adopted at the Party Congress. From that time
      on the League was a bulwark of Menshevism. It continued in
      existence
      until 1905.

Zarya (Dawn) was a Marxist
      theoretical and political journal published in Stuttgart by the
      editors of Iskra in 1901-02. Four issues appeared.
     

      The following articles by Lenin were published in
      Zarya: “Casual Notes”, “The
      Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of
      Liberalism”, the first four chapters of “The
      Agrarian Question and the ’Critics of Marx"’ (the Zarya
      title was “The ’Critics’ on the Agrarian Question"),
      “Review of Home Affairs”, and “The Agrarian
      Programme of Russian Social-Democracy”. Zarya
      also printed theoretical articles by Plekhanov.
     



[25]

      The Party Council (1903-05),
      established under the Rules adopted by the Second Congress, was
      the supreme institution of the Party. The Council was to
      co-ordinate and harmonise the activities of the Central
      Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ, to
      restore either of these institutions in the event of its entire
      membership no longer being able to function, and to represent
      the Party in relations with other parties. Convening the Party
      Congress was also the function of the Council, and it was
      obligated by the Rules to do so at stated intervals or at the
      demand of Party organisations together entitled to half of the
      votes at the Congress. The Council consisted of five members:
      two delegated by the Central Committee, two by the Central
      Organ, and the fifth elected by the Congress. The fifth member
      elected at the Second Congress was Plekhanov. Lenin was on the
      Council first as delegate of the Central Organ, then, after his
      resignation from the editorial board—as delegate of the
      Central Committee. After Plekhanov swung over to the Menshevik
      opportunists and they captured the Central Organ, the Council
      became a weapon in their fight against the Bolsheviks. Lenin
      battled consistently on the Council for Party unity, exposing
      the Mensheviks’ disruptive, splitting activities (pp. 145-87 and
      435-43 of this volume). Under the Rules adopted by the Third
      Party Congress, the Party Council was abolished.
     



[26]

      The Socialist-Revolutionaries
      (S.R.s) were a petty-bourgeois party formed in Russia at the end
      of 1901 and beginning of 1902 through the amalgamation of
      Narodnik groups and circles, with the news paper
      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia; 1900-05)
      and the magazine Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii (Herald of the
      Russian Revolution; 1901-05) as its official organs.The
      views of the Socialist- Revolutionaries were an eclectic mixture
      of Narodism and revisionism; they tried, as Lenin put it, to
      “mend the holes in Narodism” with “patches of
      the fashionable opportunist ’criticism’ of Marxism” (see
      present edition, Vol. 9, “Socialism and the
      Peasantry"). They failed to see the class distinctions between
      proletariat and peasantry, glossed over the class
      differentiation and antagonisms within the peasantry, and
      rejected the leading role of the proletariat in the
      revolution. The individual terrorism which they advocated as the
      principal means of fighting the autocracy did great harm to the
      revolutionary movement, for it interfered with organising the
      masses for revolutionary struggle.
     


      The Socialist-Revolutionaries’ agrarian programme envisaged the
      abolition of private ownership of the land and its transfer to
      the village communes on the basis of equalised tenure, and also
      the development of co-operatives of all kinds. There was nothing
      socialist in this programme of so-called “socialisation of
      the land”, since, as Lenin pointed out, abolition of
      private ownership of the land alone cannot end the domination of
      capital and the poverty of the masses. The actual, and
      historically progressive, content of the Socialist-Revolutionary
      agrarian programme was a struggle for the abolition of
      landlordism; objectively that programme expressed the interests
      and aspirations of the peasantry in the period of the
      bourgeois-democratic revolution.
     

      The Bolsheviks exposed the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ attempts
      to masquerade as socialists, battled stubbornly with them
      for influence over the peasantry, and showed how harmful their
      tactics of individual terrorism were to the working-class
      movement. At the same time they were prepared, under certain
      conditions, to make temporary agreements with the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries in the struggle against tsarism.
     

      The heterogeneous class character of the peasantry was
      responsible, in the final analysis, for political and
      ideological
      instability and organisational disunity among the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and their constant vacillation between
      the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat. There was a split
      in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party already in the years of the
      first Russian revolution (1905-07):
      its Right wing formed the legal Labour Popular-Socialist Party,
      akin in its views to the bourgeois Constitutional Democrats
      (Cadets); the “Left” wing took shape as the
      semi-anarchist Maximal ist League. During the years of reaction
      that followed the 1905-07 Revolution, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries were in a state of complete
      ideological and organisational breakdown, and the First World
      War saw most of them adopt the standpoint of social- chauvinism.
     

      After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic
      revolution in 1917, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, together with
      the Mensheviks and Cadets, were the mainstay of the
      counter-revolutionary bourgeois-landlord Provisional
      Government, of which leaders of the party (Kerensky,
      Avksentyev, Chernov) were members. In face of the revolutionary
      spirit of the peasantry, the “Left” wing of the
      party founded at the end of November 1917 an independent Left
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party and, in an effort to maintain
      their influence among the peasant masses, formally recognised
      the Soviet government and entered into an agreement with the
      Bolsheviks; but as the class struggle in the countryside
      developed,
      they set out to fight Soviet power. During the years of foreign
      military intervention and civil war, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries actively supported the
      interventionists and whiteguard generals, engaged in
      counter-revolutionary subversion and plotting, and organised
      terrorist acts against Soviet leaders. After the civil war, they
      continued their anti-Soviet activities within the country and as
      whiteguard émigrés abroad.

      "Well, and what if your sonorous, bombastic and florid assurances
      should inspire distrust because of their very nature?"
     

      "I should like to see who would dare doubt my word!"
     

      "But still, suppose it is doubted?"
     

      "I repeat, I will not allow anyone to doubt the word of a
      revolutionary, I shall stop at nothing, I shall go to any length, I
      shall demand either a direct expression of disbelief or a direct
      withdrawal, I...."
     

      "What if your demand for a direct expression of disbelief is
      accepted?"
     

      "What do you mean?"
     

      "What if you are told plainly and bluntly that you are not

      "I shall proclaim the man who dares say that a gross slanderer, I
      shall publicly brand his unparalleled conduct...."
     

      "But what if in reply he begins to show point by point that your
      whole behaviour has long since made it impossible to trust you?"
     

      "I shall go about everywhere collecting protests against this
      fratricidal controversy, I shall make emotional speeches about truth
      and justice, about crystal purity soiled by unclean hands, about the
      coarse and sordid husk of petty vanity, about the purifying flame
      which fills my soul with a supreme enthusiasm. I shall liken my
      enemies to Pontius Pilate...."
     

      "And suppose they liken you to Tartuffe for such talk?"
     

      "In that case I shall demand a court of arbitration!"
     

      "You will at once be told that your challenge is gladly accepted,
      and asked to agree that the court examine whether

    

      your adversary had legitimate grounds for doubting your
      statements."
     

      "In that case ... in that case ... I shall declare that
      ’after all that has happened’ it is ridiculous to talk of any
      ‘agreement’ between the ‘parties concerned’!”
     
 *     *  * 

      Such was what Revolutsionnaya

Rossiya[2]

      calls “the unparalleled campaign over the affair of
      April

 2”[3]

      For very understandable reasons, that
      worthy publication hates to admit that that is what happened. It takes
      refuge in a whole series of subterfuges, which we shall have to
      examine in detail.
     

      Firstly, Revolutsionnaya Rossiya is surprised that,
      “instead of the organised Russian Social-Democratic
      movement”, to which Balmashov’s friends addressed their
      statement, it is the Iskra editorial board that
      replies. Balmashov’s friends, we are told, “have received no
      answer to their quite definite offer, addressed to a quite definite
      quarter”.
     

      That is not so, gentlemen. Like everyone else, you know very
      well what the organised Russian Social-Democratic movement
      consists of, you know all the organisations we
      have. Unlike some other people, we do not have new organisations
      springing up overnight. We have our Party committees,
      we have Iskra, we have the Organising Committee, which
      has for some time been making preparations for the Second
      Congress of the Party. Just to which “definite
      quarter” did you address yourselves? To the Second
      Congress? To the Organising Committee? No, though you talk of a
      definite quarter, you said absolutely nothing
      to define that quarter. You yourselves say that Iskra
      is recognised by the majority of the committees; consequently,
      no one could answer you but Iskra. If the Second
      Congress of our Party adopts Iskra as the Party organ,
      then Iskra’s reply will be the reply of the Party. If
      not, you will have some other organ to deal with. That is simple
      enough for a child of six to understand.
     

Revolutsionnaya Rossiya is “surprised that,
      instead of a plain answer to the plain offer of Balmashov’s
      friends” (an offer, supposedly, to give the
      Social-Democrats the

    

      opportunity to acquaint themselves with the
      true facts of the affair of April 2), “it is proposed that
      they should regard themselves and Iskra as two parties
      between whom there could, after all that has happened, be some
      kind of preliminary negotiations or ’agreements’ as to the
      presentation of the issue”. And so, Revolutsionnaya
      Rossiya now asserts that we were not offered a court of
      arbitration, but only an opportunity of acquainting
      ourselves. That is not so. The “Statement” in No. 27
      of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya speaks literally of an
      “uninvestigated charge of slander” (against
      Iskra), of having an investigation of the
      charge, of submitting “the following evidence to
      a person on whose integrity and secrecy both we and the Central
      Organ [mark that!]  of the Russian Social-Democratic Party could
      rely”. “Investigation of the charge”,
      “examination of evidence” by a per son on whom both
      accuser and accused can rely—what is that but a court of
      arbitration? Is that only an offer to acquaint ourselves with
      the facts?? You are a comic lot, gentlemen. After calling upon
      us to agree about selecting a person of integrity, you now
      declare with the inimitable lofty air of a

 Nozdrev[4]
      caught red-handed that no agreement is possible!
     

Revolutsionnaya Rossiya “further asks whom
      Iskra is trying to make a fool of when it talks about an
      agreement as to the presentation of the issue, and in the same breath
      decrees its own presentation and categorically asserts that no other
      is possible”. In court, everyone categorically asserts his own
      opinion and claims that it is the only correct one. Instead of in turn
      giving his own definite presentation of the issue, our
      haughty opponent begins to bluster and make fine speeches!
     

      After a certain amount of bluster, however, Revolutsionnaya
Rossiya condescends to make also a few remarks about our
presentation of the issue. In its opinion, Iskra is
dodging and retreating. It isn’t, we are told, as if
“the Combatant Organisation denied Iskra’s
right to have its own free opinion [I I, to judge political
acts from its own point of view, or even [sic! I to
have its private doubts about anything it liked”. This
“private doubts” is really priceless!  The
“Combatant Organisation” is so extraordinarily
broad- minded as to be prepared (now, after a year and more of

    

      warfare!) to permit us even to doubt—but only
      privately, that is, presumably, in such a way that no one but the
      doubter shall know anything about it.... Perhaps when these
      combatant people allow us to hold our own “free
      opinion” they
      also mean us to do so privately?
     

"One might think," Revolutsionnaya Rossiya says,
“that it was only Iskra’s refusal to accede to this
demand that was the reason for accusing it of slander." Then follow
quotations from the article “Tartuffes of Revolutionary
Morality” and the remark that “what we have here is not
modest and indefinite doubts, but very immodest and very definite
charges”.
 

We invite our readers to recall certain generally known facts. In
No. 20 of Iskra (May 1,1902), we give our opinion of
Balmashov’s act, without having the slightest idea of the existence of
any combatant organisation. The latter thereupon writes us a letter
demanding that we seek the motives for Balmashov s decision in its
official statements. We silently drop this letter from an unknown
organisation into the wastepaper basket. The letter is then published
in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya, No. 7 (June 1902), the editors of
which, for no other reason than our silence, begin to cry that a slur
has been cast on the moral aspect, that the significance of the act is
being belittled, and so on. We reply with an article entitled
“An Enforced Controversy” (Iskra, No. 23, August
1, 1902), in which we laugh at this angry Jupiter, uphold our opinion
of the act of April 2, and declare that in our view it is “more
than doubtful” whether Balmashov be longed to any
“combatant organisation”. Thereupon Messieurs the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, having extorted from us a public expression
of our private doubts, raise an hysterical outcry about
“unparalleled conduct” and talk about nothing less than
“mud-slinging” and “insinuations”
      (Revolatsionnaya Rossiya, No. 11, September 1902).
 

      Such, in the briefest outline, are the main facts of our press
      controversy. Someone who knows very well that his opponent regards his
      utterances with silent distrust publicly forces him to the wall and
      demands an open expression of either belief or disbelief, and when he
      gets the latter answer, beats his breast and complains urbi et

orbi[1]

      what a

    

      noble creature he is and how shamefully he has been
      insulted. What is this but Nozdrev conduct? What is it but
      revolutionary swashbuckling?  Did not such a person deserve to
      be called a Tartuffe?
     

      Where does Revolutsionnaya Rossiya get the idea that we
      are retreating and refuse to answer for our article and for the
      articles about Tartuffes? Is it from the fact that in our
      presentation of the issue we do not set forth the theses of
      these articles? But was the arbitration offer issued in
      connection with any particular articles—was it not rather
      in connection with Iskra’s general attitude towards the
      assurances of the “Socialist-Revolutionary Party"? Do not
      Balmashov’s friends, at the very beginning of their statement in
      No. 27 of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya, cite precisely the
      starting-point of the whole controversy, namely,
      Iskra’s remark, in No. 23, that in its view it was more
      than doubtful whether Balmashov belonged to any “combatant
      organisation"? We make so bold as to assure Revolutsionnaya
      Rossiya that we answer for all our articles; that
      we are prepared to supplement our questions for the arbitration
      court by references to any issue of Iskra;
      that we are ready to prove to anyone that we had every moral
      right and valid reason to describe as Tartuffes those on
      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya who, on account of our
      presumptuous doubts as to the veracity of that paper’s
      utterances, indulged in the expressions we have quoted.
     

      "Dodging and retreating"—yes, but on whose part? Is
      it not on the part of those who are now magnanimously prepared
      to recognise our right to a free opinion and to private doubts,
      after indulging for over a year in disgusting bombast
      against Iskra for stubbornly persisting in its doubts
      and maintaining that every serious person was in duty bound to
      have doubts about revolutionary romancing? When you saw that
      your emotional talk about probity and honour actually moved your
      hearers to laughter, not tears, you decided you must have a new
      sensation, and came out with your demand for an arbitration
      court. The scandal loving element in the colonies abroad rubbed
      their hands with glee and went about eagerly whispering:
      “They have summoned them to court ... at last! Now we
      shall see!" And now they have seen—have seen the last act
      of a vaudeville,

    

      whose hero, with an ineffable air of injured innocence, declares that
      “after all that has happened” no agreements as to the
      presentation of the issue to the court are possible.
     

      Just carry on in the same spirit, gentlemen! But bear in mind that no
      torrents of wretched words will prevent us from discharging our duty
      of exposing phrase-mongering and mystification wherever they may
      occur—whether in the programmes” of revolutionary
      adventurers, or in the tinsel of their romancing, or in grandiloquent
      sermons about truth and justice, purifying flames, crystal purity, and
      all the rest.

      Letters on tasks of the revolutionary youth could be
      arranged on the following plan:
     

      I. What the present-day student body consists of and what the
      task of achieving its ideological unity involves.
     

      II. Importance of Marxism in revolutionising the students (in
      the revolutionary movement).
     

      III. Social-Democrats and Socialist-Revolutionaries in
      Russia. Theoretical and tactical differences between
      them. Terrorism.
     

      IV. Problems of student organisation from the standpoint of
      “revolutionising the students”.
     

      V. Students and the working class (?).
     

      { Ideological unity= a certain lack of ideological
      principles. General argument—different groups among the
      students. Analyse—what groups, their accidental or
      inevitable character.
     

      Uplifters in different classes of society. 

      Uplifters as basis of liberals. 

      Class character of the six groups insufficiently distinct:
autocracy the chief determining factor (reactionaries—
      uplifters—liberals). Petty bourgeoisie, workers,
      bourgeoisie—

      c l a s s[1]
groupings
      already beginning to take shape.
     

      Progressive significance of class (and political)
      differentiation. Example. Academics and their
      differentiation from
    

“liberals”. This differentiation does not
      hinder but helps political utilisation (development, growth).
     

      “Ideological unity”. Quid

est?[2]

Between
whom? Academics + liberals?
Liberals + socialists?
     

Only Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats?
     

      Achieving ideological unity=propagating definite ideas,
      clarifying class differences, effecting ideological
      demarcation.
     

      Achieving ideological unity = propagating ideas that can lead
      forward, the ideas of the progressive class.
     

      Revolutionary Marxism, its emergence in Europe before
      1848, its role in Western Europe and Russia.
     

      { i n s e r t: about the

      “superkluge"[3]

      contention that bourgeois students cannot become imbued with
      socialism. }
     

 
Notes
 

[1]

Not “newly emerged” (the socialist
intelligentsia), but going back half a century, beginning with
the Petrashevsky

circle,[4]
approximately. —Lenin

[2]

What is it?—Ed. 

[3]

“Over-clever.”–Ed. —Lenin
 



[4]

      The Petrashevsky circlewas a group of progressive-minded
      commoner-intellectuals formed in St. Petersburg in the mid-forties of the
      last
      century around M. V. Butashevich-Petrashevsky, a fol lower of the French
      utopian socialist Fourier. Among the members were writers, teachers,
      students, minor government officials, army officers, and so on. While not
      uniform in their political views, most of them were opponents of the tsarist
      autocracy and the serf system.
     

      Among those connected with the Petrashevsky circle were the writers
      Dostoyevsky and Saltykov-Shchedrin and the poets Pie shcheyev, Maikov, and
      Taras Shevchenko.

      The editorial statement of the newspaper

 Student,[4] which, if we are not mistaken, was first
      published in No. 4
      (28) of

 Osvobozhdeniye,[5] and which was
      also received by Iskra, is indicative in our opinion of a
      considerable advance in the editors’ views since the appearance of the
      first issue of Student. Mr. Struve was not mistaken when he
      hastened to express his disagreement with the views set forth in the
      statement: those views do indeed differ radically from the trend of
      opportunism so consistently and zealously maintained by the
      bourgeois-liberal organ. By recognising that “revolutionary
      sentiment alone cannot bring about ideological unity among
      the students”, that “this requires a socialist ideal
      based upon one or another socialist world outlook” and,
      moreover, “a definite and integral” outlook, the editors
      of Student have broken in principle with ideological
      indifference and theoretical opportunism, and have put the question of
      the way to revolutionise the students on a proper footing.
     
 

      True, from the current standpoint of vulgar
      “revolutionism”, the achievement of ideological
      unity among the students
      does not require an integral world outlook, but rather precludes it,
      involving a “tolerant” attitude towards the various kinds
      of revolutionary ideas and abstention from positive commitment to some
      one definite set of ideas; in short, in the opinion of these political
      wiseacres, ideological unity presupposes a certain lack of ideological
      principles (more or less skilfully disguised, of course, by hackneyed
      formulas about breadth of views, the importance of unity at all costs
      and immediately, and so on and so forth).

      A rather plausible and, at first glance, convincing argument always
      produced in support of this line of reasoning is to point to the
      generally known and incontrovertible fact that among the students
      there are, and are bound to be, groups differing greatly in their
      political and social views, and to declare that the demand for an
      integral and definite world outlook would therefore inevitably repel
      some of these groups and, consequently, hinder unity, produce
      dissension instead of concerted action, and hence weaken the power of
      the common political onslaught, and so on and so forth, without end.
     

      Let us examine this plausible argument. Let us take, for
      example, the division of students into groups given in
      No. I of Student. In this first issue the
      editors did not yet advance the demand for a definite and
      integral world outlook, and it would therefore be difficult to
      suspect them of a leaning towards Social-Democratic
      “narrowness”. The editorial in the first issue of
      Student distinguishes four major groups among the
      present-day students: 1) the indifferent
      crowd—"persons completely indifferent to the student
      movement”; 2) the “academics"—those who favour
      student movements of an exclusively academic type; 3)
      “opponents of student movements in
      general—nationalists,
      anti-Semites, etc."; and 4) the d politically
      minded"—those who believe in fighting for the overthrow of
      tsarist despotism. “This group, in turn, consists of two
      antithetical elements—those belonging to the purely
      bourgeois political opposition with a revolutionary tendency,
      and those who belong to the newly emerged [only newly
      emerged?— N. Lenin] socialistically minded
      revolutionary intellectual proletariat." Seeing that the latter
      subgroup is divided in its turn, as we all know, into
      Socialist-Revolutionary students and Social-Democratic students,
      we find that there are among the present-day students
      six political groups:

      reactionaries, indifferents, academics, liberals, Socialist-
      Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats.
     

      The question arises: is this perhaps an accidental grouping, a
      temporary alignment of views? That question has only to be raised for
      anyone at all acquainted with the matter to answer it in the
      negative. And, indeed, there could not be any other grouping among our
      students, because

    

      they are the most responsive section of the intelligentsia, and
      the intelligentsia are so called just because they most
      consciously, most resolutely and most accurately reflect and
      express the development of class interests and political
      groupings in society as a whole. The students would not be what
      they are if their political grouping did not correspond to the
      political grouping of society as a whole—
      “correspond” not in the sense of the student groups
      and the social groups being absolutely proportionate in strength
      and numbers, but in the sense of the necessary and inevitable
      existence among the students of the same groups as in
      sccie y. And Russian society as a whole, with its (relatively)
      embryonic development of class antagonisms, its political
      virginity, and the crushed and downtrodden condition of the
      vast, overwhelming majority of the population under the rule of
      police despotism, is characterised by precisely these six
      groups, namely: reactionaries, indifferents, uplifters,
      liberals, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social- Democrats. For
      “academics” I have here substituted “up
      lifters”, i.e., believers in law-abiding progress without
      a political struggle, progress under the autocracy. Such
      uplifters are to be found in all sections of Russian society,
      and everywhere, like the student “academics”, they
      confine themselves to the narrow range of professional
      interests, the improvement of their particular branches of the
      national economy or of state and local administration;
      everywhere they fearfully shun “politics”, making no
      distinction (as the academics make none) between the
      “politically minded” of different trends, and
      implying by the term politics everything that concerns ... the
      form of government. The uplifters have always constituted, and
      still constitute, the broad foundation of our liberalism: in
      “peaceful” times (i.e., translated into
      “Russian”, in times of political reaction) the
      concepts uplifter and liberal become practically synonymous;
      and even in times of war, times of rising public feeling, times
      of mounting onslaught on the autocracy, the distinction between
      them often remains vague. The Russian liberal, even when he
      comes out in a free foreign publication with a direct and open
      protest against the autocracy, never ceases to feel that he is
      an uplifter first and foremost, and every now and again he will
      start talking like a slave, or,

    

      if you prefer, like a law-abiding, loyal and dutiful subject—
      vide Osvobozhdeniye.
     

      The absence of a definite and clearly discernible border line
      between uplifters and liberals is a general characteristic of
      the whole political grouping in Russian society. We might be
      told that the, above division into six groups is incorrect
      because it does not correspond to the class division of Russian
      society. But such an objection would be unfounded. The class
      division is, of course, the ultimate basis of the political
      grouping; in the final analysis, of course, it always
      determines that grouping. But this ultimate basis becomes
      revealed only in the process of historical development and as
      the consciousness of the participants in and makers of that
      process grows. This “final analysis” is arrived at
      only by political struggle, sometimes a long, stubborn struggle
      lasting years and decades, at times breaking out stormily in the
      form of political crises, at others dying down and, as it were,
      coming temporarily to a standstill. Not for nothing is it that
      in Germany, for example, where the political struggle assumes
      particularly acute forms and where the progressive
      class—the proletariat—is particularly class-
      conscious, there still exist such parties (and powerful par ties
      at that) as the Centre, whose denominational banner serves to
      conceal its heterogeneous (but on the whole decidedly
      anti-proletarian) class nature. The less reason is there to be
      surprised that the class origin of the present-day political
      groups in Russia is strongly overshadowed by the politically
      disfranchised condition of the people as a whole, by the
      domination over them of a remarkably well organised,
      ideologically united and traditionally exclusive
      bureaucracy. What is surprising, rather, is that Russia’s
      development
      along European capitalist lines should already, despite her
      Asiatic political system, have made so strong a mark on the
      political grouping of society.
     

      In our country too, the industrial proletariat, the progressive class
      of every capitalist country, has already entered on the path of a
      mass, organised movement led by Social-Democracy, under the banner of
      a programme which has long since become the programme of the
      class-conscious proletariat of the whole world. The category of people
      who are indifferent to politics is of course incomparably

    

      larger in Russia than in any European country, but even in
      Russia one can no longer speak of the primitive and primeval
      virginity of this category: the indifference of the non-
      class-conscious workers—and partly of the peasants
      too—is giving place more and more often to outbursts of
      political unrest and active protest, which clearly demonstrate
      that this indifference has nothing in common with the
      indifference of the well-fed bourgeois and petty
      bourgeois. This latter class, which is particularly numerous in
      Russia owing to her still relatively small degree of capitalist
      development, is already unquestionably beginning, on the one
      hand, to produce some conscious and consistent reactionaries;
      but on the other hand, and immeasurably more often, it is still
      little to be distinguished from the mass of ignorant and
      downtrodden “toiling folk” and draws its ideologues
      from among the large group of

 raznochintsy[6] intellectuals, with their absolutely
      unsettled world
      outlook and unconscious jumble of democratic and
      primitive-socialist ideas. It is just this ideology that is
      characteristic of the old Russian intelligentsia, both of the
      Right wing of its liberal-Narodnik section and of the most
      Leftward wing: the “Socialist Revolutionaries”.
     

      I said the “old” Russian intelligentsia. For a
      new intelligentsia, whose liberalism has almost
      entirely sloughed off primitive Narodism and vague socialism
      (not without the help of Russian Marxism, of course), is already
      making its appearance in our country. The formation of a real
      bourgeois-liberal intelligentsia is proceeding in Russia with
      giant strides, especially owing to the participation in this
      process of people so nimble and responsive to every opportunist
      vogue as Messrs. Struve, Berdyaev, Bulgakov & Go. As
      regards, lastly, those liberal and reactionary elements of
      Russian society who do not belong to the intelligentsia, their
      connection with the class interests of one or another group of
      our bourgeoisie or landowners is clear enough to anyone at all
      acquainted, say, with the activities of our

 Zemstvos,[7]
      Dumas, stock-exchange committees, fair committees, etc.
     

 

      And so, we have arrived at the indubitable conclusion that the
      political grouping of our students is not accidental, but is
      bound to be such as we have depicted above, in concurrence with
      the first issue of Student. Having established that
      fact, we can easily cope with the controversial question of
      what, actually, should be understood by “achieving
      ideological unity among the students”,
      “revolutionising” the students, and so on. It even
      seems very strange at first glance that so simple a question
      should have proved controversial. If the political grouping of
      the students corresponds to the political grouping of society,
      does it not follow of itself that “achieving ideological
      unity” among the students can mean only one of two things:
      either winning over the largest possible number of students to a
      quite definite set of social and political ideas, or
      establishing the closest possible bond between the students of a
      definite political group and the members of that group outside
      the student body. Is it not self-evident that one can speak of
      revolutionising the students only having in mind a perfectly
      definite content and character of this revolutionising process?
      To the Social-Democrat, for example, it means, firstly,
      spreading Social-Democratic ideas among the students and
      combating ideas which, though called
      “Socialist-Revolutionary”, have nothing in common
      with revolutionary socialism; and, secondly, endeavouring to
      broaden every democratic student movement, the academic kind
      included, and make it more conscious and determined.
     

      How so clear and simple a question was confused and rendered
      controversial is a very interesting and very characteristic
      story. A controversy arose between Revolutsionnaya
      Rossiya (Nos. 13 and 17) and Iskra (Nos. 31 and
      35) over the “Open Letter” of the Kiev Joint Council
      of United Fraternities and Student Organisations (printed in
      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya, No. 13, and in
      Student, No. 1). The Kiev Joint Council
      characterised as “narrow” the decision of the Second
      All-Russian Student Congress of 1902 that student organisations
      should maintain relations with the committees of the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party; and the quite obvious fact that
      a certain section of the students in certain localities
      sympathise with the “Socialist Revolutionary Party”
      was nicely covered up by the very

    

      "impartial” and very unsound argument that “the
      students as such cannot associate themselves in their entirety
      with either the Socialist-Revolutionary Party or the Social-
      Democratic Party”. Iskra pointed to the
      unsoundness of this argument, but Revolutsionnaya
      Rossiya, of course, flew to arms in its defence, calling
      the Iskra-ists “fanatics for divisions and
      splits” and accusing them of “tactlessness”
      and lack of political maturity.
     

      After what has been said above, the absurdity of such an
      argument is only too apparent. The question at issue is the
      particular political role the students should play. And, don’t
      you see, you must first shut your eyes to the fact that the
      students are not cut off from the rest of society and therefore
      always and inevitably reflect the political grouping of society
      as a whole, and then, with eyes thus shut, proceed to chatter
      about the students as such, or the students in general. The
      conclusion arrived at is ... the harmfulness of divisions and
      splits resulting from association with a particular political
      party. It is clear as daylight that in order to carry this
      curious argument to its conclusion, the arguer had to leap from
      the political plane to the occupational or educational
      plane. And it is just such a flying leap that
      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya makes in the article “The
      Students and Revolution” (No. 17), talking, firstly, about
      general student interests and the general student struggle and,
      secondly, about the educational aims of the students, the task
      of training themselves for future social activity and developing
      into conscious political fighters. Both these points are very
      just—but they have nothing to do with the case and only
      confuse the issue. The question under discussion is
      political activity, which by its very nature is
      connected inseparably with the struggle of parties and
      inevitably involves the choice of one definite
      party. How, then, can one evade this choice on the grounds that
      all political activity requires very serious scientific
      training, the “development” of firm convictions, or
      that no political work can be confined to circles of
      politically minded people of a particular trend, but must be
      directed to ever broader sections of the population, must link
      up with the occupational interests of every section, must unite
      the occupational movement with the political movement and raise
      the former to the level of the

    

      latter?? Why, the very fact that people have to resort to such devices
      in order to defend their position shows how sadly they themselves are
      wanting both in definite scientific convictions and in a firm
      political line! From whatever side you approach the matter, you find
      fresh confirmation of the old truth which the Social-Democrats have
      long propounded in condemning the efforts of the Socialist-
      Revolutionaries to balance themselves—as regards both scientific
      theory and practical politics—between Marxism, West-European
      “critical” opportunism and Russian petty- bourgeois

      Narodism.[1]


      Indeed, imagine a state of things where political relations are
      at all developed and see how our “controversial
      question” looks in practice. Suppose there is a clerical
      party, a liberal party and a Social-Democratic party. In certain
      localities they function among certain sections of the students,
      let us say, and, perhaps, of the working class. They try to win
      over as many as possible of the influential representatives of
      both. Is it conceivable that they would object to these
      representatives choosing one definite party on the grounds that
      there are certain general educational and occupational
      interests common to all the students and to the entire working
      class? That would be like disputing the fact that parties must
      contend on the grounds that the art of printing is useful to all
      parties without distinction. There is no party in the civilised
      countries that does not realise the tremendous value of the
      widest and most firmly established educational and trade
      unions; but each seeks to have its own influence predominate in
      them. Who does not know that talk about this or that institution
      being non-partisan is generally nothing but the humbug of the
      ruling classes, who want to gloss over the fact that existing
      institutions are already imbued, in ninety-nine cases out of a
      hundred, with a very definite political spirit? Yet what our
      Socialist-Revolutionaries do is, in effect, to sing dithyrambs
      to “non-partisanship”. Take, for example, the
      following moving tirade in

    

      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (No. 17): “What short-sighted
      tactics it is when a revolutionary organisation is determined to
      regard every other independent, non-subordinate organisation as a
      competitor that must be destroyed and into whose ranks
      division, disunity, and disorganisation must at all costs be
      introduced!" This was said in reference to the 1896 appeal of the
      Moscow Social-Democratic organisation, which reproached the students
      for having in recent years with drawn into the narrow confines of
      their university interests, and which Revolutsionnaya Rossiya
      admonished, saying that the existence of student organisations never
      prevented those who had “crystallised as revolutionaries”
      from devoting their energies to the workers’ cause.
     

      Just see how much confusion there is here. Competition is
      possible (and inevitable) only between a political organisation
      and another political organisation, a political tendency and
      another political tendency. There can be no competition between
      a mutual aid society and a revolutionary circle; and when
      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya ascribes to the latter the
      determination to destroy the former, it is talking sheer
      nonsense. But if in this same mutual aid society there develops
      a certain political tendency—not to aid revolutionaries,
      for instance, or to exclude illegal books from the
      library—then every honest “politically minded”
      person is in duty bound to compete with it and combat
      it outright. If there are people who confine the circles to
      narrow university interests (and there undoubtedly are such
      people, and in 1896 there were far more!), then a
      struggle between them and the advocates of broadening,
      not narrowing, the interests is similarly imperative and
      obligatory. And, mind you, in the open letter of the Kiev
      Council, which evoked the controversy between
      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya and Iskra, the
      question was of a choice not between student organisations
      and revolutionary organisations, but between
      revolutionary organisations of different trends. Consequently,
      it is people already “crystallised as
      revolutionaries” that have begun to choose, while
      our “Socialist-Revolutionaries   are dragging them
      back, on the pretext that competition between a
      revolutionary organisation and a purely student organisation is
      short-sighted.... That is really too senseless, gentlemen!
     
 

      The revolutionary section of the students begin to
      choose between two revolutionary parties, and are treated to
      this lecture: “It was not by imposing a definite
      [indefiniteness is preferable, of course... I party label [a
      label to some, a banner to others I, it was not by violating the
      intellectual conscience of their fellow-students [the entire
      bourgeois press of all countries always attributes the growth of
      Social- Democracy to ringleaders and trouble-makers violating
      the conscience of their peaceable fellows...]  that this
      influence was achieved”, i.e., the influence of the
      socialist section of the students over the rest. Assuredly,
      every honest-minded student will know what to think of this
      charge against the socialists of “imposing” labels
      and “violating consciences And these spineless, flabby and
      unprincipled utterances are made in Russia, where ideas of party
      organisation, of party consistency and honour, of the party
      banner are still so immeasurably weak!
     

      Our “Socialist-Revolutionaries” hold up as an example to
      the revolutionary students the earlier student congresses, which
      proclaimed their “solidarity with the general political
      movement, leaving quite aside the factional dissensions in the
      revolutionary camp”. What is this “general
      political” movement? The socialist movement plus the liberal
      movement. Leaving that distinction aside means siding with the
      movement immediately nearest, that is, the liberal movement. And it is
      the “Socialist-Revolutionaries   who urge doing that! People who
      call themselves a separate party urge dissociation from party
      struggle! Does not this show that that party cannot convey its
      political wares under its own colours and is obliged to resort
      to contraband? Is it not clear that that party lacks any
      definite
      programmatic basis of its o vn? That we shall soon see.
     
___

      The errors in the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ arguments about the
      students and revolution cannot be attributed merely to. the lack of
      logic that we have tried to demonstrate above. In a certain sense it
      is the other way round: the illogicality of their arguments follows
      from their basic error. As a “party” they from the first
      adopted so inherently contradictory, so slippery a stand that people
      who

    

      were quite honest and quite capable of political thinking could not
      maintain it without constantly wobbling and falling. It should always
      be remembered that the Social- Democrats do not ascribe the harm done
      by the “Socialist Revolutionaries” to the socialist cause
      to various mistakes on the part of individual writers or leaders. On
      the contrary, they regard all these mistakes as the inevitable
      consequence of a false programme and political position. In a matter
      like the student question this falsity is particularly apparent and
      the contradiction between a bourgeois-democratic view point
      and a tinselled covering of revolutionary socialism becomes
      manifest. Indeed, examine the train of thought in Revolutsionnaya
Rossiya’s  programmatic article “The Students and
      Revolution”. The author’s main emphasis is on the
      “unselfishness and purity of aims”, the “force of
      idealistic motives” of the “youth”. It is here that
      he seeks the explanation of their “innovatory” political
      strivings, and not in the actual conditions of social life in Russia,
      which, on the one hand, produce an irreconcilable antagonism between
      the autocracy and very broad and very heterogeneous sections of the
      population and, on the other, render (soon we shall have to be saying:
      rendered) extremely difficult any manifestation of political
      discontent except through the universities.
     

      The author then turns his guns on the attempts of the
      Social-Democrats to react consciously to the existence of
      different political groups among the students, to bring about
      closer unity of like political groups and to separate the
      politically unlike. It is not that he criticises as incorrect
      any of these attempts in particular—it would be absurd to
      maintain that all of them were always wholly successful. No, he
      is a stranger to the very idea that differing class interests
      are bound to be reflected in the political grouping too, that
      the students cannot be an exception to society as a whole,
      however unselfish, pure, idealistic, etc., they may be, and that
      the task of the socialist is not to gloss over this difference
      but, on the contrary, to explain it as widely as possible and to
      embody it in a political organisation. The author views things
      from the idealist standpoint of a bourgeois democrat, not the
      materialist standpoint of a Social-Democrat.
 
 

      He is therefore not ashamed to issue and reiterate the appeal to
      the revolutionary students to adhere to the “general
      political movement”. The main thing for him is precisely
      the general political, i.e., the general democratic, movement,
      which must be united. This unity must not be impaired by the
      “purely revolutionary circles”, which must align
      themselves “parallel to the general student
      organisation”. From the standpoint of the interests of
      this broad
      and united democratic movement, it would be criminal, of course,
      to “impose” party labels and to violate the
      intellectual conscience of your fellows. This was just the view
      of the bourgeois democrats in 1848, when attempts to point to
      the conflicting class interests of the bourgeoisie and the
      proletariat evoked “general” condemnation of the
      “fanatics for divisions and splits”. And this too is
      the view of the latest variety of bourgeois democrats—the
      opportunists and revisionists, who yearn for a great united
      democratic party proceeding peaceably by way of reforms, the way
      of class collaboration. They have always been, and must
      necessarily be, opponents of “factional” dissensions
      and supporters of the “general political” movement.
     

      As you see, the arguments of the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
      which from the standpoint of a socialist are illogical and
      contradictory to the point of absurdity, become quite
      understandable and consistent when viewed from the standpoint of
      the bourgeois democrat. That is because the
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party is, actually, nothing but a
      subdivision of the bourgeois democrats, a subdivision
      which in its composition is primarily intellectual, in its stand
      point is primarily petty-bourgeois, and in its theoretical ideas
      eclectically combines latter-day opportunism with old-time
      Narodism.
     

      The best refutation of the bourgeois democrat’s phrases about unity is
      the course of political development and of the political struggle
      itself. And in Russia the growth of the actual movement has already
      led to this kind of refutation. I am referring to the emergence of
      the “academics” as a separate group among the students. As
      long as there was no real struggle, the academics did not stand out
      from the “general student” mass, and the
      “unity” of the whole “thinking section” of the
      students appeared inviolable. But as

    

      soon as it came to action, the divergence of unlike elements
      became

     inevitable.[2]


      The progress of the political movement and of the direct onslaught on
      the autocracy was immediately marked by greater definiteness of
      political grouping—despite all the empty talk about uniting
      anybody and everybody. That the separation of the academics and the
      politically minded is a big step forward, hardly anyone, surely, will
      doubt. But does this separation mean that the Social-Democratic
      students will “break” with the academics?
      Revolutsionnaya Rossiya thinks that it does (see No. 17,
      p. 3).
     

      But it thinks so only because of the confusion of ideas which we
      have brought out above. A complete demarcation of political
      trends in no wise signifies a “break-up” of the
      occupational and educational unions. A Social-Democrat who sets
      out to work among the students will unfailingly
      endeavour to penetrate, either himself or through his agents,
      into the largest possible number of the broadest possible
      “purely student” and educational circles;he will try
      to broaden the outlook of those who demand only academic
      freedom, and to propagate precisely the Social-Democratic
      programme among those who are still looking for a programme.
     
 

      To sum up. A certain section of the students want to acquire a
      definite and integral socialist World outlook. The ultimate aim of
      this preparatory work can only be—for students who want to take
      practical part in the revolutionary movement—the conscious and
      irrevocable choice of one of the two trends that have now taken shape
      among the revolutionaries. Whoever protests against such a choice on
      the plea of effecting ideological unity among the students, of
      revolutionising them in general, and so forth, is obscuring socialist
      consciousness and is in actual fact
      preaching absence of ideological principles. ’[he political grouping
      of the students cannot but reflect the political
      grouping of society as a whole, and it is the duty of every

      socialist to strive for the most conscious and consistent
      demarcation of politically unlike groups. The Socialist-
      Revolutionary Party’s appeal to the students to “proclaim
      their solidarity with the general political movement and leave
      quite aside the factional dissensions in the revolutionary
      camp” is, essentially, an appeal to go back, from
      the socialist to the bourgeois-democratic standpoint. This is
      not surprising, for the “Socialist-Revolutionary
      Party” is only a subdivision of the bourgeois democrats in
      Russia. When the Social-Democratic student breaks with the
      revolutionaries and politically minded people of all other
      trends, this by no means implies the break-up of the general
      student and educational organisations. On the contrary, only on
      the basis of a perfectly definite programme can and should one
      work among the widest student circles to broaden their academic
      outlook and to propagate scientific socialism, i.e., Marxism.
     

P. S. In subsequent letters I should like to discuss with the
      readers of Student the importance of Marxism in moulding an
      integral world outlook, the differences between the principles and
      tactics of the Social-Democratic Party and the Socialist-Revolutionary
      Party, the problems of student organisation, and the relation of the
      students to the working class generally.
     

 
Notes
 

[1]

It need hardly be said that the thesis that the programme and tactics
of the Socialist-Revolutionaries are inconsistent and inherently
contradictory requires special detailed elucidation. We hope to go into
this in detail in a subsequent letter.  —Lenin

[2]

If certain reports are to be credited, a further divergence of the
unlike elements among the students is becoming increasingly marked, namely,
dissociation, of the socialists from political revolutionaries who
refuse to hear of socialism. It is said that this latter trend is very
pronounced among the students exiled to Siberia. We shall see if these
reports are confirmed.  —Lenin
 



[3]

      No subsequent letters appeared. The article was reprinted as a mimeographed
      pamphlet under the title “To the Students. The Tasks of the
      Revolutionary Youth (Social-Democracy and the In telligentsia)"; and
      Department of Police documents for 1904-05 show that copies of the pamphlet
      were discovered during arrests and house-searches in Ekaterinoslav,
      Nizhni-Novgorod, Kazan, Odessa, Arzamas, and the Smolensk and Minsk
      gubernias.

      liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, published abroad in 1902-05 under the

      made up the core of the Constitutional-Democratic (Cadet) Party, the

Zemstvos—the so-called local self-government bodies,
      dominated by the nobility, set up in the central gubernias of tsarist Russia
      in

   

1864. Their competence was confined to purely local economic and welfare
      matters (hospital and road building, statistics, insurance, etc.), and they
      functioned under the control of the provincial governors and the Ministry of
      the Interior, who could invalidate any decisions the government found
      undesirable.

      In our 46th issue we reprinted the resolution of the Fifth Congress of
      the Bund on the position of the Bund in the R.S.D.L.P., and gave our
      opinion of it. The Foreign Committee of the Bund replies at great
      length and with great heat in its leaflet of September 9 (22). The
      most material part of this angry reply is the following phenomenal
      revelation: “In addition to its maximum Rules [sic!],
      the Fifth Congress of the Bund also drew up minimum
Rules”; and these minimum Rules are quoted in full, it
      being explained in two notes, moreover, that “the rejection of
      autonomy” and the demand that other sections of the Party appeal
      to the Jewish proletariat only with the sanction of the Bund Central
      Committee “must be put forward as an ultimatum”.
      Thus decided the Fifth Congress of the Bund.
     

      Charming, is it not? The Bund Congress draws up two sets of Rules
      simultaneously, defining simultaneously both its maximum and
      minimum desires or demands. The mini mum it prudently (oh, so
      prudently!) tucks away in its pocket. Only the maximum is published
      (in the leaflet of August 7[20]), and it is publicly
      announced, clearly and explicitly, that this maximum draft is
      “to be submitted to the Second Congress of the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party as the basis for the
      discussion [mark that! I of the Bund’s position in the
      Party”. The Bund’s opponents, naturally, attack this maximum
      with the utmost vehemence, just because it is the maximum, the
      “last

word”[1]

of the

    

      trend they condemn. Thereupon, a month later, these people,
      without the slightest embarrassment, pull the “minimum out of
      their pocket, and add the ominous word:
      “ultimatum"!
     

      That is a positive last price, not a “last
      word”.... Only is it really your last, gentlemen? Perhaps you’ve
      got a minimal minimum in another pocket? Perhaps in another month or
      so we shall be seeing that?
     

      We very much fear that the Bundists do not quite realise all the
      “beauty” of this maximum and minimum. Why, how else can
      you haggle than by asking an exorbitant price, then knocking off 75
      per cent and declaring, “That’s my last price"? Why, is there
      any difference between haggling and politics?
     

      There is, gentlemen, we make bold to assure you. Firstly, in politics
      some parties adhere systematically to certain principles, and
      it is indecent to haggle over principles. Secondly, when people who
      claim to belong to a party regard certain of their demands as an
      ultimatum, that is, as the very condition of their membership in the
      party, political honesty requires that they should not conceal the
      fact, should not tuck it away “for the time
being” in their pocket, but, on the contrary, should say so
      openly and definitely right from the start.
     

      We have been preaching these simple truths to the Bundists for a long
      time. As early as February (in our 33rd issue) we wrote that it was
      stupid and unbefitting to play hide-and-seek, and that the Bund had
      acted separately (in issuing its statement about the Organising
      Committee) because it wanted to act as a contracting party
      and present terms to the Party as a

      whole.* [* See present edition, Vol. 6,
pp. 310-25.—Ed.
] For this opinion
      we were ,drenched with a whole bucketful of specifically Bundist (one
      might with equal justice say, specifically fish-market) abuse, yet
      events have now shown that we were right. It is indeed as a
      contracting party that the Bund comes forward in the

    

      decisions of its Fifth Congress, presenting outright ultimatums to
      the Party as a whole! That is just what we have been trying all along
      to get the Bundists to admit, by showing that it followed inevitably
      from the position they had taken up; they angrily protested, dodged
      and wriggled, but in the end were obliged after all to produce their
      minimum
     

      That is funny; but funnier still is the fact that the Bund continues
      to wriggle even now, continues to talk about the “falsity”
      of “Iskra’s old, generally known fabrication to the
      effect that the Bund wants to form a federal alliance with the Russian
      Party”. That is a lying fabrication, it claims, because
      Paragraph I of the Rules proposed by the Bund distinctly
      speaks of its desire to be a component element of the Party, not to
      form an alliance with it.
     

      Very good, gentlemen! But does not this same paragraph say that
      the Bund is a federated component of the Party? Don’t
      your maximum Rules refer throughout to contracting parties?
      Don’t the minimum Rules speak of an ultimatum, and make
      any change in their “fundamental clauses” contingent
      on the mutual consent of the component elements of the
      Party, neither the local nor the district organisations,
      moreover, being recognised as such for this purpose? You
      yourselves say that neither local nor district organisations,
      but only “integral elements of the same nature as the
      Bund” can be contracting parties. You yourselves mention
      by way of example that “the Polish, Lithuanian or Lettish
      Social-Democrats” might be regarded as such integral
      elements, “if they belonged to the Party”,
      as you sensibly add. But what if they do not belong to the
      Party? And what if the federation of national organisations
      which you find desirable is found undesirable and emphatically
      rejected by all the rest of the Party?  You know very well that
      that is how matters stand; you yourselves expressly say you no
      longer demand that the whole Party be built on the basis of a
      federation of nationalities. To whom, then, are you
      addressing your ultimatum? Is it not obvious that you
      are addressing it to the whole Party, minus the Bund? Instead of
      convicting Iskra of a lying fabrication, you only
      convict yourselves of a minimum of logic in your subterfuges.
     
 


      But look, the Bundists protest, in our minimum Rules we have
      even deleted the federation demand! This deletion of the
      “dreadful” word is indeed the most interesting
      episode in the famous transition from maximum to
      minimum. Nowhere
      else, perhaps, has the Bund’s unconcern for principles betrayed
      itself so na ively. You are dogmatists, hope less dogmatists, we
      are told; nothing in the world will induce you to recognise the
      federal “principle of organisa tion”. We, on the
      other hand, are not dogmatists, we “put the matter on a
      purely practical footing”. Is it some prin ciple you don’t
      like? Queer fellows!  Why, then we’ll do with out any principle
      at all, we’ll “formulate Paragraph I in such a way that it
      shall not be a declaration of a definite principle of
      organisation”. “The crux of the matter does not lie
      in the statement of principle prefacing the Rules, but in their
      concrete clauses, which are derived from an examination of the
      needs of the Jewish working-class movement, on the one hand, and
      of the movement as a whole, on the other” (leaflet of
      September 9 [221, p. 1).
     

      The naïveté of this argument is so delightful that
      one just wants to
      hug the author. The Bundist seriously believes that it is only certain
      dreadful words the dogmatists fear, and so he decides that if these
      words are deleted, the dogmatist will see nothing objectionable in
      the concrete clauses themselves! And so he toils in the sweat of his
      brow, draws up his maximum Rules, gets in reserve his minimum Rules
      (against a rainy day), draws up ultimatum No. I, ultimatum
      No. 2.... Oleum et operam perdidisti, amice!—you are
      wasting time and effort, my friend. In spite of the cunning (oh,
      wonderfully cunning!) removal of the label, the dogmatist detects the
      federal principle in the minimum’s “concrete clauses”
      too. That principle is to be seen in the demand that a component
      element of the Party should not be limited by any territorial bounds,
      and in the claim to be the

“sole”[2]
    

      representative of the Jewish proletariat, and in the demand for
      “representation on the Party Central Committee; in the
      denial to the Party Central Committee of the right to
      communicate with any part of the Bund without the consent of the
      Bund Central Committee; in the demand that fundamental clauses
      should not be changed without the consent of the component
      elements of the Party.
     

      No, gentlemen, the crux of this matter of the Bund’s position in the
      Party does lie in the declaration of a definite principle of
      organisation, and not at all in the concrete clauses. The crux of the
      matter is a choice of ways. Is the historically evolved
      isolation of the Bund to be legitimised, or is it to be rejected on
      principle, and the course openly, definitely, firmly and honestly
      adopted of ever closer and closer union and fusion with the Party as a
      whole? Is this isolation to be preserved, or a turn made towards
fusion? That is the question.
     

      The answer will depend on the free will of the Bund, for, as we
      already said in our 33rd issue, “love cannot be
      forced”. If you want to move towards fusion, you
      will reject federation and accept autonomy. You will understand
      in that case that autonomy guarantees a process of fusion so
      gradual that the reorganisation would proceed with the minimum
      of dislocation, and in such a way, moreover, that the Jewish
      working-class movement would lose nothing and gain everything by
      this reorganisation and fusion.
     

      If you do not want to move towards fusion, you will stand for
      federation (whether in its maximum or minimum form, whether with
      or without a declaration); you will be afraid of being
      “steam-rollered”, you will turn the regrettable
      isolation of the Bund into a fetish, and will cry that the
      abolition of this isolation means the destruction of the Bund;
      you
      will begin to seek grounds justifying your isolation, and in
      this search will now grasp at the Zionist idea of a Jewish
      “nation”, now resort to demagogy and
      scurrilities.
     

      Federalism can be justified theoretically only on the basis of
      nationalist ideas, and it would be strange if we had to prove to the
      Bundists that it was no mere accident that the declaration of
      federalism was made at that very Fourth Congress which proclaimed the
      Jews to be a nation.
     
 


      The idea of fusion can be discredited in practice only by
      inciting politically unenlightened and timid people against the
      “monstrous”,

 “Arakcheyev”[3]
      organisational
      plan of Iskra, which supposedly wants to
      “regiment” the commit tees and not allow them to
      “take a single step without orders from above”. How
      terrible! We have no doubt that all the committees will now
      hasten to revolt against the iron glove, the Arakcheyev fist,
      etc.... But where, gentlemen, did you get your information about
      this brutal organisational plan? From our literature? Then why
      not quote it? Or from the tales of idle Party gossips, who can
      tell you on the very best authority all, absolutely all the
      details regarding this Arakcheyevism? The latter supposition is
      probably the more correct, for even people with a minimum of
      logic could hardly confuse the very necessary demand that the
      Central Commit tee should “be able to communicate
      with every Party

      member"* [* See present edition, Vol. 6,
      p. 487.—Ed.]

      with the patently scurrilous bugbear
      that the Central Committee will “do everything
      itself” and “lay down the law on
      everything”. Or another thing: what is this nonsense that
      “between the periphery and the centre” there will be
      “lose

Organisationen"?** [** Loose, broad
organisations
.—Ed.]

      We can guess: our worthy
      Bundists heard something, but did not know what it was all
      about. We shall have to explain it to them at length on some
      suit able occasion.
     

      But, worst of all, it is not only the local committees that will
      have to revolt, but the Central Committee too. True, it has not
      been born

 yet,[4] but the
      gossips know for certain not
      only the birthday of the infant but its whole subsequent
      career. It appears it will be a Central Committee
      “directed by a group of writers”. Such a
      tried and cheap method of warfare, this. The Bundists are not
      the first to employ it and most likely will not be the last. To
      convict this Central Committee, or the Organising Committee, of
      any mistake,you have to find proof.To convict people of not
      acting as they themselves think necessary, but of being
      directed by others, you must have the courage to bring
      charges openly and be ready to answer for them to the whole
      Party! All that is too dear, too dear in every respect. Gossips’

    

      tales, on the other hand, are cheap.... And perhaps the fish will
      bite. It is not pleasant, after all, to be considered a man (or
      institution) who is “directed”, who is in leading strings,
      who is a pawn, a creature, a puppet of Iskra.... Our poor,
      poor future Central Committee! Where will it find a protector against
      the Arakcheyev yoke? Perhaps in the “independently acting”
      Bundists, those strangers to all “suspiciousness"?
     

 
Notes
 

[1]

By the way, it is extremely characteristic of the Bund’s methods of
controversy that this expression called down on our heads the
particular wrath of Posledniye

Izvestia.[5]
Why the last word, it demanded, when
it (the demand for federation) had been uttered over two years

   

ago? Iskra was counting on the short memory of its
readers!... Calm yourselves, calm yourselves, gentlemen! The author
of the article called your maximum Rules the last word because
that word was uttered two days (approximately) before
No. 46 of Iskra, and not two years ago.  —Lenin

[2]

      “This word is of no significance,” the Bund now assures us.
      Strange! Why should a word that has no significance have been inserted
      in both minimum and maximum? In the Russian language the word has a
      perfectly definite significance. What it signifies in the present
      instance is a “declaration” of both federalism and
      nationalism. We would advise the Bundists, who can see no connection
      between nationalism and federation, to ponder this point.

      Lenin says that the Central Committee “has not been born
      yet” out of secrecy considerations; actually, the Central
      Committee already existed—it had been elected at the Second Party
      Congress on August 7 (20), 1903.

      After a number of unsuccessful attempts to reach an
      understanding in private conversations, the Central Commit tee
      of the Party and the editorial board of the Central Organ deem
      it their duty to address you officially in the name of the Party
      which they represent. The refusal of Comrade Martov to take his
      seat on the editorial board or to collaborate on Iskra,
      the refusal of the ex-members of the Iskra editorial
      board to collaborate, and the hostile attitude of several
      comrades engaged in practical work towards the central
      institutions of our Party are creating an absolutely abnormal
      attitude on the part of this “opposition”, so
      called, towards the Party as a whole. Their passive aloofness
      from Party work, their attempts to “boycott” the
      central Party institutions (as expressed, for example, in
      ceasing to contribute to Iskra beginning from its 46th
      issue and in the resignation of Comrade Blumenfeld from the
      printing establishment), their persistence, in conversation
      with a member of the Central

 Committee,[1] in calling
      themselves a “group”, in defiance of the Party
      Rules, their violent attacks on the Congress-approved personal
      composition of the central bodies and their demand to have it
      changed as a condition for ending the boycott—all this is
      conduct which cannot be regarded as consistent with Party
      duty. Such conduct borders on a direct breach of discipline and
      nullifies the decision adopted by the Congress (in the Party
      Rules) that the

    

      allocation of the Party’s forces and resources is the function of the
      Central Committee.
     

      The Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central
      Organ therefore remind all members of the so-called
      “opposition” of their Party duty. Dissatisfaction
      with the personal composition of the central bodies, whether due
      to personal resentment or to differences of opinion which
      particular Party members may consider serious, cannot and must
      not
      lead to disloyal actions. If, in the opinion of any person, the
      central bodies are committing mistakes, it is his duty as a
      Party member to point to these mistakes in the full view of the
      entire Party membership, and, above all, to point them out to
      the central bodies themselves. It is likewise the Party duty of
      the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central
      Organ to examine all such intimations with the utmost care, no
      matter from whom received. Yet neither the editorial board of
      the Central Organ nor the Central Committee has received from
      the so-called opposition any clear and definite intimations of
      mistakes or expressions of dissatisfaction or disagreement on
      any score whatever. Comrade Martov even refuses to take his seat
      on the editorial board of the Central Organ and on the supreme
      Party Council, though only in that post would he be able to lay
      bare before the Party all such mistakes as he may descry in the
      activities of the central bodies.
     

      The Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central
      Organ are firmly convinced that the Russian Social- Democratic
      Labour Party will not allow the institutions it has set up to be
      influenced by the illegitimate, covert (in relation to the
      Party) and disloyal method of pressure and boycott. The Central
      Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ declare
      that they will remain at their posts come what may, until such
      time as the Party shall remove them, and that they will do their
      duty and spare no effort to perform the functions with which
      they have been charged. The attempts at “boycott”
      will not induce either the editorial board of the Central Organ
      or the Central Committee to swerve one hair’s breadth from the
      path they are following, in pursuance of the will of the
      Congress;

    

      such attempts will only cause minor unpleasantnesses and major
      damage to individual branches of Party work, and will convict
      those who persist in them of failing to under stand their Party
      duty and of violating it.

      Prefatory Remarks to the Report On the Second Congress of the
      R.S.D.L.P., October 13 (20)
    
I

      Lenin made a few prefatory remarks to his report. I propose, in the
      first place, he said, to keep to the pseudonyms used at the Congress,
      because I am accustomed to them and it will be easier for me to use
      them than to stop and think each time what organisation the delegate
      represented. Secondly, I propose to touch also on the meetings of the
      Iskra organisation which took place, privately, so to speak,
      in the intervals between sittings of the Congress. I think this is in
      order, firstly, because the League was the foreign branch of the
      Is/era organisation, secondly, because the Is/era
      organisation has now been dissolved, and, thirdly, because without
      these facts it will be more difficult for me to bring out the true
      meaning of the events at the Party Congress.
     
II

      Comrade Martov is against any reference being made 10 the
      private meetings of the Iskra organisation on the
      grounds that no minutes were kept. But neither are the minutes
      of the Party Congress available yet, and I cannot cite them
      either. After all, Comrade Martov is present here and will be
      able to correct any inaccuracies that may creep in. If the
      private meetings of Iskra have a bearing on the matter,
      I shall bring them to the knowledge of an even wider
      audience—Comrade Martov will not be able to hush them up
      any
      way. ("Oho!") I remember perfectly whom I kept out
      of these meetings, and who withdrew from them, and I shall have
      a lot to say on this score. Of course, mistakes may occur, and I
      shall not be able to reconstruct everything from memory. The 
      important thing is the political grouping.

    

      What it was as shown by each particular vote taken, I can, of course,
      recall only approximately, but in general it is perfectly clear to
      me. It is not in the interest of the work to conceal from the League
      what pertains to the Iskra organisation, which has now been
      dissolved, and what has already become the common concern of the
      Party. As to the pseudonyms used in the minutes, they would be better,
      of course, but I have not read the minutes and am therefore
      unacquainted with them.
     
III

      Comrade Martov is afraid that discussing the private meetings of
      Iskra may land us in the domain of tittle-tattle. I had no
      intention of entering the domain of tittle-tattle, and we shall see
      who will be able to keep the argument on the plane of principle, and
      who will have to descend into that murky
      domain. ("Oho!") We shall see, we shall see! I consider
      myself fully at liberty to touch on the meetings of the editorial
      board, and will not object if Comrade Martov does likewise;
      nevertheless, I must point out that during the Congress there was not
      a single meeting of the editorial board as such.
     
IV

      The chief purpose of my report is to show that Comrade Martov made a
      mistake; but in his hint regarding Comrade Plekhanov I detect
      something quite different. Let me remind you of what I said on one
      occasion at the Party Congress:
      "What a storm of indignation is usually aroused when people say
      one thing at committees and another on the floor of the

      Congress.”[1]

      To
      hint at such behaviour is no longer discussing political conduct but
      indulging in personalities. As regards P. B. Axelrod’s statement that
      X. went away completely uninformed, let me say that that was not so at
      all. He himself wrote me a letter saying that in his opinion there was
      a lot that was personal about this whole divergence and not much that
      related to principle. From that I conclude that he was already
      informed. And in answer to his request for my opinion regarding the
      Congress, I wrote to him on several occasions too.

      Report On the Second Congress
      of the R.S.D.L.P., October 14 (27)

      Before beginning his report, Lenin referred to the discussion at the
      previous sitting as to how far mention might be made of the private
      meetings held by the Iskra-ists during the Party Congress. He
      interpreted yesterday’s decision of the Congress as meaning that facts
      not recorded in the minutes must be touched on as little as possible,
      and therefore intended, in referring to the meetings of the
      Iskra organisation, to deal only with the voting results.
     

      After this introduction, he went on to speak of the period
      immediately preceding the Party Congress. In the Organising
      Committee, whose business it was to arrange the Congress, the
      Iskra-ists predominated, and its work was carried on
      along Iskra-ist lines. But even while the Congress
      arrangements were still in progress it became apparent that the
      Organising Committee was far from being completely at one. To
      begin with, it included a Bundist, who did everything he could
      to prevent the convocation of an Iskra-ist Congress;
      this member of the Organising Commit tee always pursued a
      separate line of his own. There were also two Yuzhny
      Rabochy members on it, and although they considered
      themselves Iskra-ists, and even announced their
      adherence to Iskra, on which subject there were lengthy
      negotiations, they could not be wholly regarded as such. Lastly,
      even the Iskra-ist members of the Organising Committee
      were not completely at one; they had differences among
      themselves. It is also important to mention the Organising
      Committee’s decision on the subject of binding
      instructions. This question came up long before the Congress,

    

      and the decision arrived at was that binding instructions be
      abolished. The editorial board too pronounced emphatically in
      favour of this. The decision applied to itself also. It was
      decided that at the Congress, since it was the supreme Party
      authority, no member of the Party, or of the editorial board,
      should consider himself bound by any commitments to the
      organisation that had delegated him. It was in view of this
      decision that I drafted a

      Tagesordnung* [*
      Agenda.—Ed.] for the
      Congress, together with a commentary, which I decided to submit
      to the Congress in my own name. Item 23 of this draft had the
      comment in the margin that three persons should be elected to
      the editorial board and as many to the Central Committee. There
      is one other point in this connection. As the editorial board
      consisted of six persons, it was decided by common consent that,
      if it were found necessary to hold a meeting of the board during
      the Congress and the votes divided equally, Comrade Pavlovich
      would be invited to the meeting with full voting rights.
     

      The delegates began to arrive long before the opening of the
      Congress. The Organising Committee gave them an opportunity to get
      acquainted with the editors beforehand. Very naturally, the
      Iskra-ists wanted to present themselves at the Congress
      united and in harmony on all points, and with this in view private
      conversations were held with the delegates as they arrived, and
      meetings were arranged to work out a common viewpoint. At these
      meetings the political complexion of some of the delegates became
      pretty clear. At one such meeting, for instance, where I read a paper
      on the national

 question,[4] the delegate from
      the Mining Area expressed views akin to those of the Polish Socialist

 Party,[5] and in
      general betrayed extreme confusion of
      ideas.
     

      Such were the circumstances that preceded the Congress.
     

      I shall now
      explain how I came to be the only delegate from the League, although
      it had elected two. It turned out that no delegate had arrived from
      the Iskra organisation in

 Russia,[6] which was
      also to have sent two delegates. Thereupon a meeting of the
      Iskra-ists, held just before the Congress opened, decided
      that one of the two League

    

      delegates should turn over his mandate to the other and himself act as
      the delegate of the Iskra organisation with its two mandates,
      with the provision that if an elected delegate should arrive from
      Russia, one of these two man dates would be turned over to
      him. Naturally, both Martov and I wanted to be the delegate from
      Iskra, in view of the minor role played by the League. We
      settled the point by drawing lots.
     

      The first preliminary question—the election of the Congress
      Bureau—gave rise to something of a difference, true, a minor
      one, between Martov and me. He insisted on the election of nine
      persons, these even to include a Bund ist. I, on the other hand,
      considered that we should elect a Bureau capable of pu1 uing a firm,
      consistent policy and, if necessary, even of applying what is called
      the “iron glove”. The Bureau elected consisted of
      Plekhanov, Lenin, and Pavlovich.
     

      In addition to five Bundists, there were at the Congress two
      delegates from the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and
      a delegate from the St. Petersburg League of Struggle, who
      nearly always voted with them. From the very outset these
      persons greatly dragged out the proceedings. The discussion of
      the Congress Standing Orders alone took up an incredible amount
      of time. There were endless arguments, lasting several sittings,
      over the position of the Bund in the Party. Similar delays were
      caused by the Bundist who got on to the Credentials
      Committee. He practised obstruction at every turn, would not
      agree with the other members of the committee, of which I was
      one, on a single point, and invariably recorded a
      “dissenting opinion”. When it was remarked that this
      sort of thing was likely to drag out the Congress, he replied,
      “Well, let it”, and said he was ready to have the
      committee sit for any length of time. It was not till long after
      midnight that the work of verifying the credentials was
      finished.
     

      Also in the opening days of the Congress we had an incident over the
      Organising Committee. Under the Regulations it had drawn up, only
      “prominent Party personalities” could be invited to the
      Congress in a deliberative capacity, and the Credentials Committee had
      rejected the request of the Borba group to be granted
      representation. Two members

    

      of the Organising Committee had attended the Credentials Committee
      meeting, and they had categorically opposed admitting a Borba
      representative to the Congress. When the spokesman for the committee
      informed the Congress of this decision, a long debate
      “for” and “against” developed, in which one of
      the Iskra-ists declared that a representative of Borba should
      on no account be invited to the Congress, as that group did nothing
      but intrigue, try to insinuate itself into every chink, sow dissension
      everywhere, and so on. (Trotsky:
      "Why don’t you give the speaker’s name? It was I who said it."
      P. Axelrod: “The speaker evidently does not think it
      would be in his interest.") Yes, it was Comrade Trotsky who spoke so
      harshly of the Borba group. At the very height of this argument about
      whether a Borba representative should be admitted to the Congress, one
      of the Yu zhny Rabochy delegates, who had been late in
      arriving and had only just turned up, asked for a five-minute
      adjournment to allow him to acquaint himself with all the
      circumstances of the case. When the adjournment was granted, the
      members of the Organising Committee held a meeting then and there, by
      the window. I should mention that even before the Congress opened
      certain Organising Committee members had shown some dissatisfaction
      with the editorial board. For example, the Bundist member was highly
      indignant that the editorial board had sent its contribution of five
      hundred marks to the election fund of the German Social- Democrats in
      its own name and that of the Organising Committee without first
      obtaining the latter’s sanction. This innocent action, which was quite
      natural considering the impossibility of communicating promptly with
      the comrades in Russia, was interpreted by the Bundist as meaning that
      the editors, living abroad, made free with the name of the Organising
      Committee without asking its consent. A motion was even tabled in the
      Organising Committee to censure the editors for this, and it was
      passed, because the Bundist was supported by Comrade NN, a member of
      the Iskra organisation. When I told Martov of this, he was
      much incensed, and said it was
      “infamous”. (Martov: “I did not use the
      word ’infamous’.") I do not remember the exact expression he
      used. Martov added that he “would not let the matter rest
      there”. I, for my part, tried to persuade him

    

      that the incident was of no great significance, and that it
      would be better to say nothing and attach no importance to
      it. When the meeting of the Organising Committee by the window
      was over, Comrade Paviovich, who was a member of it, informed
      the other two members of the Bureau that on the motion of the
      belated Yuzhny Rabochy delegate, who was also a member
      of the Organising Committee, the latter had decided by a
      majority of all against Paviovich himself to invite the Borba
      representative Ryazanov to the Congress, in a deliberative
      capacity. Comrade Pavlovich had objected strongly to this
      decision, and, as binding instructions had been abolished, he
      considered himself at liberty to protest against it to the
      Congress. We Bureau members, and also the editors and other
      Iskra-ists, were outraged at this decision of the
      Organising Committee. Comrade NN, the Organising Committee
      member I have mentioned, had him self spoken in the Credentials
      Committee against admitting a Borba representative to the
      Congress, yet now, at this meeting of the Organising Committee,
      he had agreed to invite one. He was himself trying now to
      smuggle Ryazanov into the Congress. We had thus been caught in a
      trap. And we decided to fight with might and main against this
      disgraceful Organising Committee decision. Many delegates rose
      and opposed it. In my own speech on the subject I spoke of
      “the storm of indignation that is aroused at European
      congresses when people say one thing at committees and another
      on
      the floor of the congress”. In saying this I had in mind
      NN, who was a member of the Iskra organisation. When
      Comrade Paviovich made his protest to the Congress against this
      decision of the Organising Committee, the Yuzhny
      Rabochy member found this to be a breach of discipline, a
      disruptive move, and so on, and demanded that the Congress
      inflict suitable punishment on Comrade Paviovich for his
      action. But we were able to smash all these arguments. The
      Organising Committee majority was defeated. A resolution was
      passed to the effect that after the Congress had appointed a
      Credentials Committee the Organising Committee as a body no
      longer had any right to influence the composition of the
      Congress. The motion to invite Ryazanov was rejected. But even
      since the Congress I have heard some Iskra-ists
      question: why not have admitted a Borba

    

      member to the Congress? (Deutsch: “I said that at
      the Congress itself too.") Quite so, and on other questions
      also, as I shall have occasion to point out, Comrade Deutsch did
      not always vote with the rest of the Iskra-ists, as,
      for instance, on equality of languages. Some Iskra-ists
      have even been expressing the very singular view that the
      activities of the Central Committee should reflect all
      vacillations and primitive conceptions existing in the
      Party. And at the Congress certain irresolute, wavering
      Iskra-ists spoke in this same spirit. Thus, the idea
      that all who claim to be Iskra-ists really are
      Iskra-ists turns out to be quite mistaken. There are
      Iskra-ists who are even ashamed of the name—that
      is a fact. There are Iskra-ists who fight
      Iskra, who obstruct it in all kinds of
      ways and hinder its activities. Iskra has become
      popular, it has become the fashion to call oneself an
      Iskra-ist, but that does not prevent many people from
      remaining what they were before Iskra was recognised by
      many of the committees. These unreliable Iskra-ists
      have done it a great deal of harm. If at least they would fight
      it openly and squarely.... But no, they do it in a sneaking,
      underhand, surreptitious, secret manner.
     

      The second item on the Tagesordnung of the Party
      Congress was the Party programme. The supporters of
      Rabocheye Dyelo, the Bundists, and diverse delegates
      who during the Congress were nicknamed the “Marsh”
      practised incredible obstruction. The debate on the programme
      dragged out beyond all belief. Akimov alone moved several dozen
      amendments. There were arguments literally over single words,
      over what conjunction to use. So many amendments had to he
      discussed that one Bundist, a member of the Programme Committee,
      asked, and with reason, whose draft we were considering, the one
      submitted by the editors of Iskra, or one submitted by
      Akimov. The amendments were trifling, and the programme was
      adopted without any changes of importance whatever;
      nevertheless, the debates took up about .twenty sittings, so
      unproductive was the work of the Congress owing to the
      opposition of various anti-Iskra-ist and quasi
      Iskra-ist elements.
     

      The next major incident to arise at the Congress after the Organising
      Committee incident was in connection with equality of languages, or,
      as it was ironically called at the

    

      Congress, “freedom of tongues”. (Martov:
      “Or the ’asses’."  Laughter.) Yes, and the
      “asses". The point was this. The draft Party programme
      spoke of equal rights for all citizens irrespective of sex,
      nationality, religion, etc. This was not enough for the
      Bundists, and they wanted to write into the programme the right
      of every nationality to receive tuition in its own language and
      to use it in addressing public and state institutions. When a
      garrulous Bundist referred, by way of example, to state stud
      farms, Comrade Plekhanov remarked that stud farms had nothing to
      do with it, as horses do not talk—"only asses
      do”. The Bundists took offence at this, evidently thinking
      the jest was meant for them.
     

      It was over the equality of languages question that the first signs of
      a split appeared. In addition to the Bundists, the Rabocheye
Dyelo-ists, and the “Marsh”, certain
      Iskra-ists too pronounced in favour of “freedom of
      tongues”. Comrade Deutsch’s votes on this issue evoked our
      astonishment, indignation, and disgust; in some cases he abstained,
      in others voted against us. In the end the question was decided
      amicably and unanimously.
     

      On the whole, during the first half of the Congress all the
      Iskra-ists stood together. The Bundists claimed there was a
      conspiracy against them. One Bundist described the Congress as a
      “compact majority”. In reply, I expressed the wish that
      our whole Party might become one compact majority.
     

      But the second half of the Congress presented an entirely different
      picture. From that time began Martov’s historic change of front. The
      disagreements that developed between us were by no means
      insignificant. They were due to Martov’s erroneous appraisal of the
      present situation. Comrade Martov deviated from the line he had
      previously adhered to.
     

      The fifth item on the Tagesordnung was the Rules. An argument
      between Martov and myself over Paragraph I of them had already arisen
      in the committee. We each upheld a different formulation. Whereas I
      proposed defining a Party member as one who accepted the Party
      programme, support ed the Party financially and belonged to one of its
      organisations, Martov thought it sufficient if, in addition to the
      first two conditions, a person worked under the control of one of the
      Party organisations. I insisted on my formulation

    

      and pointed out that we could not adopt a different definition
      of a Party member without departing from the principle of
      centralism. To recognise as a Party member one who did not
      belong to any Party organisation would mean being against all
      control by the Party. Martov was introducing here a new
      principle that was entirely contr iry to the principles of
      Iskra. His formulation widened the boundaries of the
      Party. He tried to justify this by saying that our Party must be
      a party of the masses. What he was doing was to open the door to
      every kind of opportunist, to widen the boundaries of the Party
      until they became entirely blurred. In the conditions under
      which we have to work this is very dangerous, because it is very
      difficult to draw the line between a revolutionary and a
      windbag; that made it necessary to narrow the concept
      “Party”. Martov’s mistake was that he was throwing
      the door of the Party wide open to every adventurer, when it had
      become apparent that even at the Congress fully one-third of
      those present were given to intriguing. Martov on this occasion
      acted as an opportunist. His formulation introduced a false,
      discordant note into the Rules: every Party member should be
      under the control of an organisation, so that the Central
      Committee should be able to communicate with every single
      member. My formulation provided an incentive to
      organise. Comrade Martov was cheapening the concept “Party
      member”, while it should, I consider, stand high, very
      high. Martov got the support of Rabocheye Dyelo, the
      Bund and the “Marsh”, and with their aid he secured
      the adoption of his Paragraph I of the Rules.
     

      Then Martov began to say that “defamatory rumours”
      were being circulated about him. But there was nothing offensive
      in pointing out with whom Martov found himself in alliance. I
      was the object of a similar reproof when I found myself in
      alliance with Comrade Brouck re. And I took no offence when
      Martov sent me a note saying: “Look who is voting with
      you." True, my alliance with Brouck re was a temporary and
      accidental one, while Martov’s alliance with the Bund turned out
      to be lasting. I was against Mai  toy’s formulation because it
      meant

      Versumplung.[2]

I warned Martov of that, and
      our
      opponents, by following him to

    

      a man, provided eloquent illustration of his error. The most dangerous
      thing, however, was not that Martov had landed in the marsh, but that,
      having accidentally done so, he made no attempt to get out of it, but
      sank in deeper and deeper. The Bundists felt they were now the masters
      of the situation, and put their mark on the Party Rules.
     

      During the second half of the Congress, too, a compact majority
      was formed, only it now consisted of a coalition of the
      Martovites plus the “Marsh” plus the Rabocheye
      Dyelo and Bund compact minority. And this compact majority
      stood against the Iskra-ists. One Bundist, seeing the
      Iskraists quarrelling among themselves, said:
      “It’s nice to spar when the leaders are at loggerheads." I
      cannot understand why the Bund should have withdrawn, things
      being as they were. They were actually the masters of the
      situation, and could have had a lot their own way. Most
      probably, they had binding instructions.
     

      After Paragraph 1 of the Rules had been spoilt in this
      way, we had to bind the broken pot as tightly as possible, with
      a double knot. Naturally, we began to fear that we would be
      intrigued against, let down. Hence it was necessary to
      introduce mutual co-optation to the central bodies, so that the
      Party might be assured of their unity of action. Over this a
      struggle developed too. Things had to be so arranged that in
      the period leading to the Third Party Congress we should not get
      a repetition of what had happened with the Organising
      Committee. A consistent, honest Iskra ist cabinet had
      to be formed. On this point we were again defeated. The clause
      on mutual co-optation to the central bodies was voted down. The
      mistake of Martov, who was supported by the “Marsh”,
      stood out more saliently than ever. From that moment the
      coalition was definitely formed and, on pain of defeat, we had
      to load our guns with double charges. There sat the Bund and
      Rabocheye Dyelo, their votes deciding the fate of the
      Congress. That caused the stub born, bitter struggle that
      ensued.
     

      I shall now pass to the private meetings of the Iskra
      organisation. At these we chiefly discussed the composition of the
      Central Committee. At all four meetings of the Iskra
      organisation, there were debates on the subject of Comrade NN, on whom
      a section of the Iskra-ists wanted

    

      to pass a vote of political non-confidence, though not in the
      literal sense of the term, for no one imputed to NN any thing
      that disgraced him, but in the specific sense that he was unfit
      to be a member of the Iskra-ist cabinet. This led to a
      desperate scrap. At the last meeting, the meeting of the
      sixteen, nine voted against NN, four in favour, while the rest
      abstained. At this meeting, too, we discussed who was now to be
      included in our cabinet.
     

      Martov and I proposed different “trios”; we could
      not agree on them. Not wanting to split the vote at the
      Congress, we decided to propose a compromise list. We were
      prepared
      to make every concession: I agreed to a list that included two
      Martovites. The minority rejected this. Incidentally, a
      Yuzhny Rabochy delegate refused to be included in our
      list while consenting to be included in the Martovite list. It
      was Yuzhny Rabochy—an outside element— that
      was deciding the question of the Central Committee. After the
      Iskra-ists had split, we had to muster our sup porters,
      and we started a vigorous agitation. The unexpected withdrawal
      of the Bund reversed the whole situation. With its withdrawal,
      there was again a compact majority and minority. We were now in
      the majority, and we secured the election to the Central
      Committee of the people we wanted.
     

      Such were the circumstances that led to the split. It was exceedingly
      tactless of Martov to raise at the Congress the question of endorsing
      all the six editors of Iskra, when he knew that I would
      insist on the editors having to be elected. It meant turning the
      election of the editorial board into an expression of non-confidence
      in individual editors.
     

      The elections ended at five o’clock on Saturday. We then proceeded to
      discuss the resolutions. We had only a few hours left for this. Owing
      to the obstruction and delays caused by the “Marsh”, many
      important items had to be dropped from the Tagesordnang; not
      enough time was left, for instance, to discuss all the tactical
      questions.
     

      Over the resolutions the Congress was so unanimous that we formed the
      impression that a conciliatory mood had developed; it seemed to us
      that Martov was not going to make the disagreements that had arisen an
      issue of state. He even said, when one of the Yuzhny
Rabochy-ists questioned the validity of the elections, that the
      minority accepted all the

    

      Congress decisions. All the resolutions were passed in a peaceful and
      amicable spirit; differences arose only over Starover’s resolution on
      the liberals. It was vague, and it, too, was marked by opportunism; we
      fought it and secured the adoption of an additional resolution on the
      same subject.
     

      The general impression one got of the Congress was that we had
      to fight against intrigue. It was made impossible for us to
      work. The natural conclusion was: “Heaven preserve us from
      friends like these!"—i.e., the quasi-Iskra
      ists. Martov completely failed to understand this situation. He
      elevated his mistaken position to a principle. His assertion
      that the majority had instituted a “state of siege”
      ran glaringly counter to the Party’s real needs. For the work to
      be more effective, it was necessary to eliminate the obstructing
      elements and make it impossible for them to damage the Party;
      only if that were done could our work at the next Congress be
      fruitful. That is why it was necessary to establish complete
      unity between the central bodies of the Party.
     

      The first half of the Congress was the complete opposite of the
      second. The cardinal, major points of the Congress as a whole were the
      following four: 1) the Organising Commit tee incident; 2) the debate
      on equality of languages; 3) the debate on Paragraph I of the
      Rules, and 4) the struggle over the elections to the Party central
      bodies.
     

      During the first half of the Congress, Martov stood with us
      against the Organising Committee, the Bund, Rabocheye
      Dyelo and the “Marsh”; during the second half
      he landed accidentally in the marsh. Now, after the Congress,
      this accidental Versump/ung is turning into a real
      Versumpfung. (Applause.)
     

    

    3
Statement Concerning Martov’s Report,
      October 15

 (28)[7]

      I protest most emphatically, as against a contemptible method
      of struggle, against Martov’s asking who was lying or intriguing in
      reporting the private conversation between him, Starover and myself. I
      wish to point out that this conflicts glaringly with Martov’s own
      statements of yesterday to the effect that he would disdain to raise
      the unanswerable question of how truthfully private conversations had
      been reproduced! I declare that Martov ’5 account of the private
      conversation en question is altogether incorrect. I
      declare that I agree to any arbitration and that I challenge Martov to
      it if he chooses to accuse me of conduct incompatible with holding a
      responsible post in the Party. I declare that it is the moral duty of
      Martov, who is not levelling any explicit accusations but only
      throwing out dark hints—that it is his duty to have the courage
      to make his accusations openly and over his signature before the
      entire Party, and that I, as a member of the editorial board of the
      Party’s Central Organ, propose to him on behalf of the whole editorial
      board that he immediately publish a pamphlet containing
      all his accusations. By failing to do this, Martov will only
      prove that all he wanted was a row at the League Congress, not the
      moral cleansing of the Party.
     

    

    4

      Speech On the Rules of the League, October 17 (30)
    

      I shall dwell chiefly on one point, namely, the main speaker’s
      idea that the League is autonomous in drawing up its
      Rules. That, in my opinion, is absolutely wrong, for the Central
      Committee, in which, under Paragraph 6 of the Party Rules, is
      vested the right to organise committees, is the only body that
      can draw up Rules for the League; for organising means first and
      foremost drawing up Rules. And until the Central Committee
      endorses the Rules of the League, the League has no
      Rules. The idea of autonomy is absolutely inapplicable here, for
      it runs counter to the Party Rules. I once again stress
      emphatically that, pending their endorsement by the Central
      Committee, the League has no Rules. As to the League having been
      endorsed by the Party Congress, that was not in recognition of
      its activities, but rather, I should say, in spite of all its
      defects—exclusively because of its consistency of
      principles.

      The Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary
      Social-Democracy Abroad was held in Geneva on October 13-18 (26-31),
      1903; it was called at the insistence of the Mensheviks. Fifteen of the
      delegates (with 18 votes) were majority adherents, headed by Lenin; 18
      delegates (22 votes) were minority adherents; and one delegate (with two
      votes) belonged to neither majority nor minority.
     

      The main item on the agenda was the report by Lenin, who had been the League’s
      delegate at the Second Party Congress. A co- report was then made by Martov,
      who defended the opportunism of the Mensheviks and indulged in calumnious
      attacks upon the Bolsheviks. Lenin and his supporters thereupon withdrew
      from the Congress. For refusal to submit to the decisions of the Second
      Party Congress, the Central Committee and the Party Council pronounced the
      League Congress unlawful.
     



[4]

      This paper on the national question Lenin later worked up into an article
      for Iskra, under the title. “The National Question in Our
      Programme” (present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 454-63).
     



[5]

      The Polish Socialist Party (P.S.P.), founded in 1892, was a
      petty-bourgeois nationalist party.
     



[6]

      The “Iskra” organisation in Russia served to unite the
      Iskra sup porters working within the country. Even before the paper
      began publication and during the first year of its existence (December
      1900-December 1901), a network of Iskra “agents”
      (P. N. and 0. B. Lepeshinsky, P. A. Krasikov, A. M. Stopani, G. M. and
      Z. P. Krzhizhanovsky, S. I. and L. N. Radchenko, A. D. Tsurupa,
      N. E. Bauman, I. V. Babushkin, and others) was set up in various parts of
      the country, and in a number of towns (St. Petersburg, Pskov, Samara,
      Poltava, and others), groups for assistance to Iskra were
      formed. These groups and agents collected funds for the paper, acted as its
      correspondents, arranged for its transport and distri bution, and set up
      facilities for reprinting it in Russia. During this period, however, they
      had little contact with each other and for the most p art communicated
      directly with the editorial board.
     

      But as the revolutionary movement mounted and the volume of practical work
      increased, it became essential to concert their efforts,to work on planned
      and organised lines to counter the parochial amateurishness which the 
      Economists were fostering and win the Social-Democratic committees to
      Iskra’s side. Lenin accordingly put forward a plan for an
      all-Russia Iskra organisation, which was to pave the way for
      uniting Russia’s scattered Social-Demo cratic organisations into a single
      centralised Marxist party. This plan he originally outlined in his article
      “Where To Begin” (May 1901), and subsequently elaborated in
      detail in What Is To Be Done? (autumn 1901-February 1902).
     

      In carrying out this plan Lenin and his associates had to combat parochial
      tendencies among some of the Iskra practical workers. “We
      must say," Lenin wrote in a letter to S. 0. Zederbaum in July 1901 (present
      edition, Vol. 34), “that we in general regard any plan for the
      publication of any district or local organ by the Iskra
      organisation in Russia as absolutely incorrect and harmful. The
      Iskra organisation exists in order to support and build up
      Iskra and to unite the Party thereby, not to cause a
      dispersion of forces, of which there is quite enough without it."
     

      In January 1902 a conference of Iskra-ists was held in Samara, with
      G. M. and Z. P. Krzhizhanovsky, F. V. Lengnik, M. A. Silvin,
      V. P. Artsybushev, and D. 1. and M. I. Ulyanov taking part. This conference
      set up a Bureau of the Iskra organisation in Rus sia, established
      regular arrangements for contacts among members of the organisation and with
      the editorial board and for the collection and allocation of funds, and
      mapped out the line in relation to the committees and local publications. It
      was further ducided, with a view to the cardinal objective of securing the
      committees’ adherence to Iskra and recognition of it as the general
      Party organ, to send members out to various parts of the
      country. “Your ini tiative," Lenin wrote to the organisers of the
      conference, “has heart ened us tremendously. Hurrah! That’s the right
      way! Reach out wider! And operate more independently, with greater
      initiative— you are the first to have begun in such a broad way, and
      that means the continuation, too, will be successful” (Lenin
      Miscellany VIII, p. 221).
     


      Although the arrest of a number of Iskra-ists in February 1902 put
      added difficulties in the way of carrying out the conference decisions, the
      Iskra organisation, with What Is To Be Done? to guide it,
      launched a vigorous drive to propagate and practically execute Lenin’s plan
      for building a real p arty. It achieved far-reaching results in effecting
      actual unity of the Social-Democratic organisations on the principles of
      revolutionary Marxism. By the end of 1902 nearly all the leading committees
      had proclaimed their solidarity with Iskra.
     

      The Iskra-ists were the leading spirits in setting up, at the Pskov
      conference of November 2-3 (15-16), 1902, the Organising Committee for
      convening the Second Party Congress, and to this com mittee they handed over
      all their contacts. The Iskra organisation, which remained in
      existence until the Second Party Congress, played a vital part in preparing
      and arranging that Congress, which brought into being a revolutionary
      Marxist party in Russia.
     



[7]

      The Statement Concerning Martov’s Report was read by Lenin at the
      third sitting of the League Congress and handed in to the Congress
      Bureau. No court of arbitration to examine Martov’s slanderous accusations
      was ever held, as Martov was obliged to admit, in a letter of November 16
      (29), 1903, that he had no doubts of Lenin’s sincerity and good faith.

October 29, 1903


      Comrades,
 

      I withdrew from the sitting of the Congress yesterday (October
      28) because I found it too disgusting to be present at that
      raking up of sordid tittle-tattle, rumours and private
      conversations which Martov undertook and performed with
      hysterical squealing to the delight of all scandal- lovers. It
      was as though in self-derision that this same Martov spoke
      eloquently the day before yesterday, about the unseemliness of
      such references to private conversations, which cannot be
      verified and which lead one to wonder which of the parties to
      the conversation is lying. It was just such unseemly
      conduct that Martov indulged in yesterday when he hysterically
      pressed me to say which of us was lying, he or I, in
      reporting the famous private conversation on the subject of the
      famous trio.
     

      This method of provoking a row by asking who is lying
      is worthy only of a swashbuckler looking for a pretext to pick a
      quarrel, or else of a man wound up to hysterical pitch and
      incapable of weighing the absurdity of his con duct. For a
      political leader accused of definite political errors to use
      such a method proves unmistakably that he has no other means of
      defence and that he is descending from the level of political
      differences to the miserable level of squabbling and
      scandal-mongering.
     

      The question now arises, what means of defence can be employed against
      this swashbuckler’s and rowdy’s trick of hurling unprovable
      charges based on private conversations?

    

      I say “unprovable” charges, because private
      conversations of which no record is kept preclude, by their very
      nature, all possibility of proof, and charges based on
      them lead merely to reiteration of the word “lie” in
      all its declensions. In the art of such reiteration Martov
      yesterday reached a pitch of real virtuosity, and I have no
      intention of following his example.
     

      In my statement yesterday I already indicated one means
      of defence, and I categorically insist upon it. I challenge my
      adversary to publish immediately a pamphlet setting forth all
      his accusations against me, which in his speech were levelled in
      the form of endless and countless dark hints about lying,
      intriguing, and so on and so forth. I demand that my
      adversary bring his charges, over his signature, before the
      whole Party, because he cast a slur on my reputation as
      a member of the editorial board of the Party Central Organ and
      said that certain individuals could not be allowed to hold
      responsible posts in the Party. I undertake to publish
      all my adversary’s accusations, for a public airing of
      the squabbles and scandal will—I know quite
      positively—be my best defence before the Party. I repeat
      that if my adversary evades my challenge, it will prove that his
      accusations are nothing but dark innuendoes, the product either
      of the slanderous propensities of a scoundrel, or of the
      hysterical irresponsibility of a politician who has blundered.
     

      However, I have another means of defence, an indirect one. In my
      statement yesterday, I said that Martov’s account of the private
      conversation en question was altogether incorrect. I am
      not going to go into that again, just be cause of the
      hopelessness and uselessness of unprovable
      assertions. But let everyone ponder over the
      “document” which I handed to Martov yesterday and
      which he read to the Congress. That document was the programme
      for the Congress and my commentary to it, a commentary written
      after the “private” conversation, sent
      by me to Martov and returned by him with his amendments.
     

      This document indisputably represents the quintessence’ of
      our conversation, and I have only to analyse its exact text to prove
      that Martov’s accusations are so much scandal. Here is the text in
      full:
 
 

      "Item 23 [of the Congress Tagesordnungj. Election of the
Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ of the
Party."
     

      My commentary: “The Congress shall elect three
      persons to the editorial board of the Central Organ and
      three to the Central Committee. These six persons

      shall, if necessary, co-opt by a two-thirds majority vote
      additional members to the editorial board of the Central Organ
      and to the Central Committee and report to this effect to the
      Congress. After the report has been endorsed by the Congress,
      subsequent co-optation shall be effected by the editorial board
      of the Central Organ and by the Central Committee separately."
     

      Martov has asserted that this system vas adopted
      solely in order to enlarge the editorial board of
      six. This assertion is directly contradicted by the
      words “if necessary”. Clearly, already at that time
      the possibility was envisaged that it might not be
      necessary. Furthermore, since the con sent of four out of six
      was required for co-optation, it is obvious that the editorial
      board could not be enlarged with out the consent of
      non-editors, without the consent of at least one member of
      the Central Committee. Consequently, the enlargement of the
      editorial board was made contingent on the consent of a person
      as to whose identity there could at that time (a month, if not
      six weeks, before the Congress) be only the vaguest
      conjectures. Consequently, it is obvious that at that
      time Martov too considered the editorial board of six, as
      then constituted, incapable of further independent
      existence, since the deciding voice in the matter of
      enlarging the elected trio was to belong to a
      non-editor, also to be elected. Martov too considered
      it impossible to convert the old editorial board of
      Iskra into the editorial board of the Party Central
      Organ without out side, non-editorial assistance.
     

      To proceed. If it had been a matter solely of enlarging the
      board of six, what would have been the point of talking about a trio?
      It would have sufficed to substitute for unanimous co-optation,
      co-optation by some specified majority. In fact, there would in
      general have been no point in talking about the editorial board, it
      would have been enough to talk about co-optation to Party institutions
      in

    

      general, or to the central Party institutions in
      particular. Consequently, it is clear that the idea was not simply
      enlargement. It is equally clear that it was not one member
      of the old editorial board, but perhaps two, or even three,
      who stood in the way of possible enlargement, seeing that, in order to
      enlarge the board of six, it was first considered desirable
      to reduce it to three.
     

      Lastly, compare the procedure for introducing “additional
      members”, i.e., for enlarging the central bodies, as now
      laid down in the Party Rules adopted by the Congress and as
      envisaged in the original plan which Martov and I together set
      down in the above-quoted commentary to Item 23 of the
      agenda. According to the original plan, the consent of 1 o u
      r against two was required (for enlargement of the
      editorial board of the Central Organ or of the Central
      Committee), while the present Rules require, in the final
      analysis, the consent of t h r e e against two; for the
      final authority in deciding about co-optation to the central
      bodies is now the Council, and if two of the editors plus one
      other member of the Council want to enlarge the editorial board,
      they can, consequently, do it against the wishes of the third.
     

      Hence, there cannot be the slightest doubt (from the precise
      meaning of a precise document) that an alteration in the
      composition of the editorial board was contemplated (by Martov
      and myself, without any protest from any of the other editors)
      long before the Congress, and that this alteration was to be
      effected irrespective of the wishes or consent of any one
      member, or possibly even two or three members, of the board of
      six. One may therefore judge how much validity now attaches to
      the wretched talk about unofficial binding instructions having
      tied the six, about moral bonds between them, about the
      importance of keeping the team intact, and the other such
      subterfuges in which Martov’s speech abounded. All these
      subterfuges run directly counter to the explicit text of the
      commentary, which calls for a reconstitution of the
      editorial board, a reconstitution to be effected by a rather
      intricate and, consequently, carefully considered procedure.
     

      Still more unquestionably does it follow from this commentary that
      alteration of the composition of the editorial board was made
      contingent on the consent of at least two

    

      comrades from Russia, elected by the Congress to member ship of the
      Central Committee. It is therefore indubitable that both I and Martov
      hoped to persuade these future members of the Central
      Committee that a definite alteration in the composition of the
      editorial board was necessary. Thus, we were leaving the composition
of the editorial board to be decided by members of the Central
Committee, without yet knowing exactly who they would
be. Consequently, we entered the struggle

C o m m i t t e e

o u r s i d e;

      and now that the majority of the influential comrades from
      Russia have sided at the Congress with me, and not with Martov
      (in regard to the differences that have arisen between us), for
      him to wail hysterically over his defeat and indulge in
      scurrilities and allegations which by their very nature do not
      admit of proof is a positively indecent and contemptible method
      of struggle.

      Inasmuch as I do not share the
      opinion of G. V. Plekhanov, member of the Party Council and of the
      ed tonal board of the Central Organ, that it will be in the interest
      of Party unity at the present time to make a concession to the
      Martovites and co-opt the board of six, I hereby resign from the Party
      Council and from the editorial board of the Central Organ.

P.S. At all events, I by no means refuse to support

[1]

      Lenin resigned from the Party Council and the editorial board of the Central
      Organ after Plekhanov openly swung over to the Men sheviks and proposed
      co-opting to the Iskra editorial board all the former editors the
      Second Party Congress had rejected.
     

      On November 5 (18) Lenin requested Plekhanov to insert in
      Iskra an announcement of his resignation from the editorial board
      (p. 113 of this volume). The changes in the membership of the
      board were announced in No. 53 of the new, Menshevik Iskra
      (November 25, 1903).

      Under this title the Bund has published a translation of an
      article from No. 34 of the

 Arbeiterstimme.[3]
      This
      article, accompanying the decisions of the Fifth Bund Congress,
      represents as it were an official commentary on those
      decisions. It attempts to give a systematic exposition of all
      the arguments which lead to the conclusion that the Bund
      âmust be a federated component of the Partyâ. It
      will be interesting to examine these arguments.
     

      The author begins by stating that the most burning question
      facing the Russian Social-Democratic movement is the question of
      unity. On what basis can it be effected? The Manifesto of

 1898[4]
      took the principle of autonomy as the basis. The author examines
      this principle and finds it to be logically false and inherently
      contradictory. If by questions which specifically concern the
      Jewish proletariat are meant only such as relate to methods of
      agitation (with reference to the specific language, mentality
      and culture of the Jews), that will be technical (?)
      autonomy. But such autonomy will mean the destruction
      of all independence, for it is an autonomy enjoyed by every
      Party committee, and to put the Bund on a par with the
      committees will be a denial of autonomy. If, on the other hand,
      autonomy is understood to mean autonomy in some questions of the
      programme, it is unreasonable to deprive the Bund of all
      independence in the other questions of the programme; and
      independence in questions of programme necessarily involves
      representation of the Bund, as such, on the central bodies of
      the Partyâthat is, not autonomy, but federation. A sound
      basis for the position of the Bund in the Party must

    

      be sought in the history of the Jewish revolutionary movement
      in Russia, and what that history shows is that all organisations
      active among the Jewish workers joined to form a single
      unionâthe Bundâand that its activities spread from
      Lithuania to Poland and then to the South of
      Russia. Consequently, history broke down all regional barriers
      and brought forward the Bund as the sole representative of the
      Jewish proletariat. And there you have a principle which is not
      the fruit of an idle brain (?) but follows from the whole
      history of the Jewish working-class movement: the Bund is the
      sole representative of the interests of the Jewish
      proletariat. And, naturally, the organisation of the proletariat
      of a whole nationality can enter the Party only if the latter
      has a federal structure: the Jewish proletariat is not only part
      of the world family of proletarians, but also part of the Jewish
      nation, which occupies a special position among-the
      nations. Lastly, it is federation that denotes close unity
      between the component elements of the Party, for its chief
      feature is direct participation by each of them in Party
      affairs, and they all feel they have equal rights. Under
      autonomy, on the other hand, the components of the Party have no
      rights, and there is indifference to its common affairs, and
      mutual distrust, friction and conflict.
     

      Such is the authorâs line of argument, which we have presented
      almost entirely in his, own words. It boils down to three
      things: considerations of a general nature as to the inherent
      contradictoriness of autonomy and its unsuitability from the
      standpoint of close unity between the components of the Party;
      lessons from history, which has made the Bund the sole
      representative of the Jewish proletariat; and, lastly, the
      affirmation that the Jewish proletariat is the proletariat of a
      whole nationality, a nationality occupying a special
      position. Thus the author endeavours to build his case on
      general principles of organisation, on the lessons of history,
      and on the idea of nationality. He triesâwe must give him
      his dueâto examine the matter from all angles. And for
      that very reason his statement of the case brings out so
      saliently the attitude of the Bund on this question which is of
      deep concern to all of us.
     
 

      Under federation, we are told, the components of the Party have
      equal rights and share directly in its common affairs; under
      autonomy they have no rights, and as such do not share in the
      general life of the Party. This argument belongs entirely to
      the realm of obvious fallacies; it is as like as two peas to
      those arguments which mathematicians call mathematical
      sophistries, and which proveâ quite logically, at first
      glanceâthat twice two are five, that the part is greater
      than the whole, and so on. There are collections of such
      mathematical sophistries, and they are of some value to school
      children. But it is even embarrassing to have to explain to
      people who claim to be the sole representatives of the Jewish
      proletariat so elementary a sophistry as the attribution of
      different meanings to the term âcomponent of the
      Partyâ in two parts of one and the same argument. When
      they speak of federation, they mean by a component of the Party
      a sum-total of organisations in different localities; but when
      they speak of autonomy, they mean by it each local organisation
      separately. Put these supposedly identical concepts side by side
      in the same syllogism, and you will arrive inevitably at the
      conclusion that twice two are five. And if the Bundists are
      still
      unclear as to the nature of their sophistry, let them consult
      their own maximum Rules and they will see that it is under
      federation that the local organisations communicate with the
      Party centre indirectly, and under autonomyâ directly. No,
      our federalists would do better not to talk about âclose
      unity"! By trying to disprove that federation means the
      isolation, and autonomy the fusion of the
      different components of the Party, they only provoke hilarity.
     

      Hardly more successful is the attempt to prove the
      âlogical falsityâ of autonomy by dividing the latter
      into programme autonomy and technical autonomy. The division
      itself is utterly absurd. Why should the specific methods of
      agitation among Jewish workers be classed under technical
      questions? What has technique to do with it, when it is a matter
      of peculiarities of language, mentality, conditions of life? How
      can you talk of independence in questions of programme in
      connection, for example, with the demand for civil equality for
      the Jews? The Social-Democratic programme only sets forth the
      basic demands, common to

    

      the entire proletariat, irrespective of occupational, local,
      national, or racial distinctions. The effect of these
      distinctions is that one and the same demand for complete
      equality of
      citizens before the law gives rise to agitation against one form
      of inequality in one locality and against another form of
      inequality in another locality or in relation to other groups of
      the proletariat, and so on. One and the same point in the
      programme will be applied differently depending on differences
      in conditions of life, differences of culture, differences in
      the relation of social forces in different parts of the country,
      and so forth. Agitation on behalf of one and the same demand in
      the programme will be carried on in different ways and in
      different languages taking into account all these
      differences. Consequently, autonomy in questions specifically
      concerning the proletariat of a given race, nation, or district
      implies that it is left to the discretion of the organisation
      concerned to determine the specific demands to be advanced in
      pursuance of the common programme, and the methods of agitation
      to be employed. The Party as a whole, its central institutions,
      lay down the common fundamental principles of programme and
      tactics; as to the different methods of carrying out these
      principles in practice and agitating for them, they are laid
      down by the various Party organisations subordinate to the
      centre, depending on local, racial, national, cultural, and
      other differences.
     

      Is there anything unclear about this conception of autonomy? And is it
      not the sheerest scholasticism to make a division into programme
      autonomy and technical autonomy?
     

      Just see how the concept autonomy is âlogically
      analysedâ in the pamphlet we are examining. âFrom
      the
      total body of questions with which the Social-Democrats have to
      deal," the pamphlet says in connection with the autonomy
      principle taken as the basis in the 1898 Manifesto, âthere
      are singled out [sic!!1 some questions, which, it is recognised,
      specifically concern the Jewish proletariat.... Where the
      realm of general questions begins, the autonomy of the Bund
      ends.... This gives rise to a duality in the position of the
      Bund in the Party: in specific questions it acts as the Bund
      ... in general questions it loses its distinctive character and
      is put on a par with an ordinary committee of

    

      the Party...." The Social-Democratic programme demands complete
      equality of all citizens before the law. in pursuance
      of that programme the Jewish worker in Vilna puts forward one
      specific demand, and the Bashkir worker in Ufa an entirely
      different specific demand. Does that mean that âfrom the
      total body of questionsâ âsome are singled
      out"? If the general demand for equality is embodied in a
      number of specific demands for the abolition of specific forms
      of inequality, is that a singling out of the specific
      from the general questions? The specific demands are not singled
      out from the general demands of the programme, but are advanced
      in pursuance of them. What is singled out is what
      specifically concerns the Jew in Vilna as distinct from what
      specifically concerns the Bashkir in Ufa. The generalisation of
      their demands, the representation of their common class
      interests (and not of their specific occupational, racial,
      local, national, or other interests) is the affair of the whole
      Party, of the Party centre. That would surely seem
      clear. enough! The reason the Bundists have muddled it is that,
      instead of logical analysis, they have again and again given us
      specimens of logical fallacies. They have entirely failed to
      grasp the relation between the Social-Democratsâ general and
      specific demands. They imagine that âfrom the total body
      of questions with which the Social-Democrats have to deal, some
      questions are singled outâ, when actually every
      question dealt with in our programme is a generalisation of a
      number of specific questions and demands; every point
      in the programme is common to the entire proletariat,
      while at the same time it is subdivided into specific questions
      depending on the proletariansâ different occupations, their
      different conditions of life, differences of language, and so on
      and so forth. The Bundists are disturbed by the
      contradictoriness and duality of the position of the Bund,
      consisting, donât you see, in the fact that in specific
      questions it acts as the Bund, while in general questions it
      loses its distinctive character. A little reflection would show
      them that such a âdualityâ exists in the position of
      absolutely every Social-Democratic worker, who in
      specific questions acts as a worker in a particular trade, a
      member of a particular nation, an inhabitant of a particular
      locality, while in general questions he âloses

    

      his distinctive characterâ and is put on a par with
every other Social-Democrat. The autonomy of the
Bund, under the Rules of 1898, is of exactly the same nature
as the autonomy of the Tula Committee; only the limits of
this autonomy are somewhat different and somewhat wider in the
former case than in the latter. And there is nothing but a
crying logical fallacy in the following argument, by which the
Bund tries to refute this conclusion: âIf the Bund is
allowed independence in some questions of the
programme, on what grounds is it deprived of
all independence in the other questions of the
programme?" This contrasting of specific and general questions
as âsomeâ and âthe othersâ is
an inimitable specimen of Bundist âlogical analysis"!
These people simply cannot understand that it is like
contrasting the different colours, tastes, and fragrances of
particular apples to the number of
âotherâ apples. We make bold to inform you,
gentlemen, that not only some, but every apple has its special
taste, colour, and fragrance. Not only in âsomeâ
questions of the programme, but in all with out
exception, you are allowed independence, gentlemen, but
only as far as concerns their application to the specific
features of the Jewish proletariat. Mein teuerer Freund,
ich ratâ Euch drum zuerst Collegium

logicum!" [1]


      The second argument of the Bundists is an appeal to history, which is
      supposed to have brought forward the Bund as the sole representative
      of the Jewish proletariat.
     

      In the first place, this is not true. The author of the pamphlet
      himself says that âthe work of other organisations
      [besides the Bund] in this direction [i.e., among the Jewish
      proletariat] either yielded no results at all, or results too
      insignificant to merit attentionâ. Hence, on his own
      admission, there was such work, and consequently the Bund
      was not the sole representative of the Jewish
      proletariat; as regards the results of this work, no one, of
      course, will rely on the Bunchâs opinion; and, lastly, it is a
      known fact that the Bund interfered with the work of
      other organisations among the Jewish proletariat (we have only
      to mention the well-known incident of its campaign against the

    

      Ekaterinoslav Party Committee for daring to issue a proclamation to
      the Jewish

 workers[5]), so
      that even if the results did indeed merit
      no attention, the Bund itself would be partly to blame.
     

      Further, the measure of truth contained in the Bundâs historical
      reference does not in the least prove the soundness of its
      arguments. The facts which did take place and which the Bund has
      in mind speak against it, not for it. These facts are that the
      Bund existed and developedâduring the five years since the
      First Congressâquite separately and independently from
      the other organisations of the Party. In general, the actual
      ties between all Party organisations during this period were
      very weak, but the ties between the Bund and the rest of the
      Party were not only far weaker than those between the other
      organisations, but they kept growing weaker all the time. That
      the Bund itself weakened these ties is directly proved
      by the history of our Partyâs organisations abroad. In 1898, the
      Bund members abroad belonged to the one common Party
      organisation; but by 1903 they had left it to form a completely
      separate and independent organisation. The separateness and
      independence of the Bund is beyond question, as is also the
      fact that it has steadily become more pronounced.
     

      What follows from this unquestionable fact? What follows in the
      opinion of the Bundists is that one must bow to this fact,
      slavishly submit to it, turn it into a principle, into the sole
      principle providing a sound basis for the position of the Bund,
      and legitimise this principle in tie Rules, which should
      recognise the Bund as the sole representative of the Jewish
      proletariat in the Party. In our opinion, on the other hand,
      such a conclusion is the sheerest opportunism,

 âtail-ismâ[6] of
      the worst kind. The
      conclusion to be drawn from the five years of disunity is not
      that this disunity should be legitimised, but that an end should
      be put to it once and for all. And will anybody still venture to
      deny that it really was disunity? All component parts
      of the Party developed separately and independently during this
      periodâare we perhaps to deduce from this the
      âprincipleâ of federation between Siberia, the
      Caucasus, the Urals, the South, and the rest??  The Bundists
      themselves say that, as regards organisational

    

      unity of its components, the Party virtually did not
      existâ and how can what evolved when the Party did not
      exist be taken as a pattern for the restoration of
      organisational unity? No, gentlemen, your reference to the
      history of the disunity that gave rise to isolation proves
      nothing whatever except that this isolation is abnormal. To
      deduce a âprincipleâ of organisation from
      several years of disorganisation in the Party is to
      act like those representatives of the historical school who, as
      Marx sarcastically observed, were prepared to defend the knout
      on the grounds that it was historical.
     

      Hence, neither the âlogical analysisâ of autonomy
      nor the appeals to history can provide even the shadow of a
      âprincipleâ justifying the isolation of the
      Bund. But the Bundâs third argument, which invokes the idea of a
      Jewish nation, is undoubtedly of the nature of a
      principle. Unfortunately, however, this Zionist idea is
      absolutely false and essentially reactionary. âThe Jews
      have ceased to be a nation, for a nation without a territory is
      unthinkable," says one of the most prominent of Marxist
      theoreticians, Karl Kautsky (see No. 42 of Iskra and
      the
      separate reprint from it The Kishinev Massacre and the
      Jewish Question, p. 3). And quite recently, examining the
      problem of nationalities in Austria, the same writer endeavoured
      to give a scientific definition of the concept nationality and
      established two principal criteria of a nationality: language
      and territory (Neue

Zeit,[7]
      1903, No. 2). A French Jew,
      the radical Alfred Naquet, says practically the same thing,
      word for word, in his controversy with the anti-Semites and the

 Zionists.[8]
      âIf it pleased Bernard Lazare," he writes of
      the well-known Zionist, âto consider himself a citizen of
      a separate nation, that is his affair; but I declare that,
      although I was born a Jew... I do not recognise Jewish
      nationality.... I belong to no other nation but the
      French.... Are the Jews a nation? Although they were one in the
      remote past, my reply is a categorical negative. The
      concept nation implies certain conditions which do not exist in
      this case. A nation must have a territory on which to develop,
      and, in our time at least, until a world confederation has
      extended this basis, a nation must have a common language. And
      the Jews no

    

      longer have either a territory or a common language.... Like
      myself, Bernard Lazare probably did not know a word of Hebrew,
      and would have found it no easy matter, if Zionism had achieved
      its purpose, to make himself under stood to his co-racials
      [congÃ©nÃ¨res] from other parts of the worldâ
      (La Petite RÃ©publique, September 24,
      1903). âGerman and French Jews are quite unlike Polish and
      Russian
      Jews. The characteristic features of the Jews include nothing
      that bears the imprint [empreinte] of nationality. If
      it were permissible to recognise the Jews as a nation, as
      Drumont does, it would be an artificial nation. The modern Jew
      is a product of the unnatural selection to which his forebears
      were subjected for nearly eighteen centuries." All that remains
      for the Bundists is to develop the theory of a separate
      Russian-Jewish nation, whose language is Yiddish and their
      territory the Pale of

 Settlement.[9]


      Absolutely untenable

scientifically,[2]

      the idea that the Jews
      form a separate nation is reactionary politically. Irrefutable
      practical proof of that is furnished by generally known facts of
      recent history and of present-day political realities. All over
      Europe, the decline of medievalism and the development of
      political liberty went hand in hand with the political
      emancipation of the Jews, their abandonment of Yiddish for the
      language of the people among whom they lived, and, in general,
      their undeniable progressive assimilation with the surrounding
      population. Are we again to revert to the exceptionalist
      theories and pro claim that Russia will be the one exception,
      although the Jewish emancipation movement is far broader and
      deeper-rooted

    

      here, thanks to the awakening of a heroic class- consciousness
      among the Jewish proletariat? Can we possibly attribute to chance the
      fact that it is the reactionary forces all over Europe, and especially
      in Russia, who oppose the assimilation of the Jews and try to
      perpetuate their isolation?
     

      That is precisely what the Jewish problem amounts to:
      assimilation or isolation?âand the idea of a Jewish
      ânationalityâ is definitely reactionary not only
      when expounded by its consistent advocates (the Zionists), but
      likewise on the lips of those who try to combine it with the
      ideas of Social-Democracy (the Bundists). The idea of a Jewish
      nationality runs counter to the interests of the Jewish
      proletariat, for it fosters among them, directly or indirectly,
      a spirit hostile to assimilation, the spirit of the
      âghettoâ. âWhen the National Assembly of
      1791 decreed the emancipation of the Jews," writes
      Renan, âit was very little concerned with the question of
      race.... It is the business of the nineteenth century to abolish
      all âghettosâ, and I cannot compliment those who seek to restore
      them. The Jewish race has rendered the world the greatest
      services. Assimilated with the various nations, harmoniously
      blended with the various national units, it will render no
      lesser services in the future than in the past." And Karl
      Kautsky, in particular reference to the Russian Jews, expresses
      him self even more vigorously. Hostility towards non-native
      sections of the population can only be eliminated âwhen
      the non-native sections of the population cease to be alien and
      blend with the general mass of the population. That is the
      only possible solution of the Jewish problem, and we should
      support everything that makes for the ending of Jewish
      isolation." Yet the Bund is resisting this only possible
      solution, for it is helping, not to end but to increase and
      legitimise Jewish isolation, by propagating the idea of a Jewish
      ânationâ and a plan of federating Jewish and non-
      Jewish proletarians. That is the basic mistake of
      âBundismâ, which consistent Jewish Social-Democrats
      must and
      will correct. This mistake drives the Bundists to actions
      unheard-of in the international Social-Democratic movement, such
      as stirring up distrust among Jewish towards non-Jewish
      proletarians, fostering suspicion of the latter and

    

      disseminating falsehoods about them. Here is proof, taken from
      this same pamphlet: âSuch an absurdity (as that the
      organisation of the proletariat of a whole nationality should be
      denied representation on the central Party bodies I could be
      openly advocated only [mark that! I in regard to the Jewish
      proletariat, which, owing to the peculiar historical fortunes
      of the Jewish people, still has to fight for equality I!!] in
      the world family of the proletariat." We recently came across
      just such a trick in a Zionist leaflet, whose authors raved and
      fumed against Iskra, purporting to detect in its
      struggle with the Bund a refusal to recognise the
      âequalityâ of Jew and non-Jew. And now we find the
      Bundists repeating the tricks of the Zionists! This is
      disseminating an outright falsehood, for we have
      âadvocatedâ âdenying representationâ not
      âonlyâ to the Jews, but also to the Armenians, the
      Georgians and so on, and in the case of the Poles, too, we
      called for the closest union and fusion of the entire
      proletariat fighting against the tsarist autocracy. It was not
      for nothing that the P.S.P. (Polish Socialist Party) raged and
      fulminated against us! To call a fight for the Zionist
      idea of a Jewish nation, for the federal
      principle of Party organisation, a âfight for the
      equality of the Jews in the world family of the
      proletariatâ is to degrade the struggle from the
      plane of ideas and principles to that of suspicion, incitement
      and fanning of historically-evolved prejudices. It glaringly
      reveals a lack of real ideas and principles as weapons of
      struggle.
     
 *     *  * 

      We thus arrive at the conclusion that neither the logical, nor
      the historical, nor yet the nationalist arguments of the Bund
      will stand criticism. The period of disunity, which aggravated
      waverings among the Russian Social-Democrats and the isolation
      of the various organisations, had the same effect, to an even
      more marked degree, in the case of the Bundists. Instead of
      proclaiming war on this historically evolved isolation (further
      increased by the general disunity), they elevated it to a
      principle, seizing for this purpose on the sophistry that
      autonomy is inherently contradictory, and on the Zionist idea of
      a Jewish nation.

    

      Only if it frankly and resolutely admits its mistake and sets out to
      move towards fusion can the Bund turn away from the false
      path it has taken. And we are convinced that the finest adherents of
      Social-Democratic ideas among the Jewish proletariat will sooner or
      later compel the Bund to turn from the path of isolation to that of
      fusion.

      Not only national, but even racial
      peculiarities are denied to the Jews by modern scientific
      investigators, who give prime prominence to the peculiarities of the
      history of the Jews. âDo the peculiarities of Jewry
      spring from its racial character?" Karl Kautsky asks, and replies that
      we do not even know with precision what race means. âThere is no
      need to bring in the concept race, which provides no real answer but
      only poses new problems. It is enough to trace the history of the Jews
      to ascertain the reasons for their characteristics." And such an
      expert in this history as Renan says: âThe characteristic
      features of the Jews and their manner of life are far more a product

      Russian Marxists have long been pointing to the degeneration of
      the old, classical, revolutionary Russian Narodism that has been
      going on steadily since the eighties. Faith declined in a
      special system of peasant economy, in the village commune as the
      germ and basis of socialism, in the possibility of avoiding the
      path of capitalism by an immediate social revolution, for which
      the people were supposed to be already prepared. The demands for
      all kinds of measures to bolster up peasant economy and
      “small people’s production” in general were the only
      ones to retain any political significance. Essentially, this was
      already nothing but bourgeois reformism; Narodism melted into
      lib eralism; a liberal-Narodnik trend arose that would not or
      could not see that the measures envisaged (credits, co operative
      societies, land improvement, enlargement of land holdings, and
      all the rest) did not go beyond the framework of
      existing bourgeois society. The Narodnik theories of
      Mr. V. V., Mr.

 Nikolai on[2]
      and their numerous echoers only
      served as a quasi-scientific cloak for this unpleasant but
      indubitable fact. Marxist criticism tore off this cloak, and the
      influence of Narodnik ideas on Russian revo lutionary circles
      began to ebb with. amazing rapidity. These ideas were already
      becoming in fact the exclusive pos session of the stratum to
      which they were kin in spirit— Russian liberal
      “society”.
     

      West-European Bernsteinism was a new current that strengthened and at
      the same time modified the above- mentioned trend. There is truth, it
      seems, in the saying that a prophet is not without honour, save in his
      own country”.

    

      Bernstein had no luck in his own country, but, on the other
      hand, his ideas were “taken seriously” and applied
      in practice by certain socialists in France, Italy and Russia,
      who rapid ly evolved into exponents of bourgeois
      reformism. Fructi fied by these ideas, our liberal-Narodnik
      trend acquired new followers of the ex-Marxist variety and at
      the same time matured inwardly, discarding certain primitive
      illusions and reactionary accretions. Bernsteinism served its
      pur pose—not by transforming socialism, but by giving
      artic ulation to the new phase of bourgeois liberalism and
      removing the socialist mask from certain quasi-social ists.
     

      A highly interesting and instructive example of the mingling and
      fusion of European opportunist and Russian Narodnik ideas is to
      be found in Mr. L. ’s article “The Agrarian
      Question” in No. 9 (33) of Osvobozhdeniye. This
      is a truly programmatic article; it diligently sets forth the
      general credo of the author and systematically applies
      it to a defVhite sphere of problems. This article will become a
      landmark in the history of Russian liberalism, denoting a big
      step forward in its shaping and consolidation.
     

      The author dresses his bourgeois liberalism in a coat cut
      according to the latest fashion. Repeating Bern stein almost
      word for word, he tries with an amusing earnestness to persuade
      the reader that “liberalism and socialism can by no means
      be separated from each other, let alone contrasted to each
      other: they are identical and inseparable in their fundamental
      ideal. Socialism offers no menace to liberalism, as many fear;
      it comes not to destroy, but to fulfil the commandments of
      liberalism." The wish, as we know, is father to the thought; and
      Mr. L. and his like would very much wish the Social-Democrats
      not to separate themselves from the liberals, and to have them
      understand socialism “not as ready-made dogmas and petri
      fied doctrines claiming to take account in advance of the whole
      course of historical development” (and so on, quite in the
      spirit of Revolutsionnaya Rossiya), but “as a
      general ethical ideal” (which, as we know, all
      philistines, the lib erals included, regard as unrealisable in
      this earthly vale and as belonging to the realm of the hereafter
      and of “things in-themselves").
     
 

      The liberals, naturally, want—excuse the vulgarism!—
      to show off their wares to the best advantage, to identify
      political liberalism in Russia with social-economic
      democracy. It is a very “well-meaning” idea, but at
      the same time very muddled and very artful. Well-meaning because
      it ex presses the kind intention of a certain section of the lib
      erals to work for broad social reforms. Muddled, because it is
      based on contrasting democratic to bourgeois liberal ism (again
      quite in the spirit of Revolutsionnaya Rossiga!); the
      author apparently has no inkling of the fact that in any
      capitalist society there are bound to be some bour
      geois-democratic elements who stand for broad democratic and
      social-economic reforms; like all the Russian

 Millerands,[3]
      he would like to identify bourgeois reformism with
      socialism, understood, of course, “not as ready-made
      dogmas”, etc. Lastly, it is a very artful idea because the
      author assures himself and others that the sympathy with
      reform—"concern for the needs and interests of the people,
      ’Narodism’ in the true and fine ethical sense of the term
      — which is entertained by a certain section of the
      liberals a certain historical moment is, or could be, a
      permanent attribute of liberalism as such. That is so naYve as
      almost to be touching. Who does not know that every bourgeois
      ex-goverument, every “His Majesty’s Opposition”
      always clamours about its true, fine and ethical
      “Narodism"—as long as it remains in opposition? The
      Russian bourgeoisie plays at Narodism (and sometimes sincerely)
      just because it is in opposition, and not yet at the helm of
      state. The Russian proletariat’s reply to the artful
      blandishments of the Osvobozhdeniye gentry will be:
      “Pas si bite, messieurs! We are not such fools,
      gentlemen, as to believe that."
     

      From these general arguments as to the identity of liberalism and
      socialism, Mr. L. passes to the general theory of the agrarian
      question. In a matter of a dozen lines he demolishes Marxism (once
      again in the spirit of Revo lutsionnaya Rossiya), presenting
      it for this purpose, as is customary, in a vulgarly simplified form
      and proclaiming it to be contrary to experience, scientifically
      unproved, and generally false! It is highly characteristic that the
      only confirmation he adduces is a reference to European
      socialist (his own italics) literature— Bernsteinian,
      evidently.

    

      A very convincing reference. If European (Euro pean!)
      socialists are beginning to think and argue like bourgeois, why
      should not Russian bourgeois proclaim them selves both Narodniks
      and socialists? If the Marxist view of the peasant question
      “were incontestable and the only possible one, it would,"
      Mr. L. assures us, “place all of Zemstvo [sic!]
      Russia in a terrible, a tragic position and doom it to inaction,
      in view of the demonstrated impossibil ity of a progressive
      agrarian policy and of rational and effective aid to peasant
      economy in general." The argument, as you see, is unanswerable:
      because Marxism demonstrates the impossibility under
      capitalism of any degree of lasting prosperity for at all broad
      sections of the peasantry, it the relore places
      “Zemstvo” (a slip of the pen for “land
      owning"?)  Russia—the Russia, that is, that lives by
      ruining and proletarising the peasantry—in a terrible, a
      tragic position. Why, yes, that is one of the historic services
      of Marxism: it has once and for all placed in a terrible, a
      tragicomic position—the ideologists of the bourgeoisie who
      deck themselves in the toga of Narodism, social-economic
      democracy, etc.
     

      To finish with Mr. L. ’s theoretical exercises we have now only
      to quote the following gem. “Here” (in agri
      culture), we are told, “there is not and cannot be that
      auto matic I! I progress which is to a certain extent possible
      in industry, depending on the objective [LI development of
      technology." This inimitable profundity has been borrowed in its
      entirety from Messieurs the Kablukovs, Bulgakovs, E. Davids and
      tutti quanti, who in their “learned” works
      justify the backwardness of their own ideas by the tech nical,
      economic and social backwardness of agriculture. The
      backwardness of agriculture is indubitable, it has long been
      recognised by Marxists and is fully explainable; but as for this
      “automatic [if only to a certain extent I progress in
      industry”, and the objective development of technol
      ogy—it is just sheer gibberish.
     

      However, excursions into the realm of science are no more than an
      architectural ornament to Mr. L.’s article. True practical politician
      that he is, he offers us, along with sheer muddle-headedness in
      general reasoning, an extremely sober and business-like practical
      programme. True,

    

      he makes the modest reservation—in his stilted official
      Russian—that he disclaims all intention of adumbrating a
      programme and confines himself to intimating his atti
      tude—but that is just his modesty. Actually, we have in
      Mr. L. ’s article a very complete and detailed agrarian pro
      gramme for the Russian liberals, which only lacks stylistic
      editing and paragraphing by clauses. It is a programme in a
      consistent liberal spirit: political liberty, democratic tax
      reform, freedom of movement, a peasant democratic agrarian
      policy aiming at the democratisation of landownership. With a
      view to this democratisation, it demands freedom to leave the
      village commune, the conversion of the latter from a compulsory
      into a voluntary association similar to any economic
      association, and democratic rent laws. The state” should
      facilitate “the transfer ·of land to the Ia bouring
      masses” by means of a number of measures, namely:
      extension of the activities of the Peasant Bank, conversion of
      the royal demesne into state demesne, “the creation of
      small farms, individual or co-operative, not using hired
      labour”, and, lastly, compulsory alienation or redemption
      of lands essential to the peasants. “Of course, this
      compulsory redemption must be placed on a firm basis of law and
      attended in each particular case by reliable guarantees”,
      but in some cases it must be effected “almost
      [sic! I uncondition ally"—for example, in
      relation to the “cut-off

 lands”,[4]
      which create
      something in the nature of feudal relations. In order to abolish
      semi-feudal relations, the state should be given the right of
      compulsory alienation and compulsory demarcation of the plots in
      question.
     

      Such is the agrarian programme of the liberals. A paral lel
      between it and the Social-Democratic agrarian pro gramme
      naturally suggests itself. Where they resemble each other is in
      the identity of the immediate tendency and the similarity of
      most of the demands. Where they differ is in the two following
      cardinally important points. Firstly, the Social-Democrats want
      to effect the abolition of the remnants of feudalism (which both
      programmes directly advance as the aim) by revolutionary means
      and with rev olutionary determinatioji the liberals—by
      reformist means and half-beartedly. Secondly, the
      Social-Democrats stress tkat the system to be purged of the
      remnants of feudalism

    

      is a bourgeois system; they already now, in advance, expose all its
      contradictions, and strive immediately to extend and render more
      conscious the class struggle that is inher ent in this new system and
      is already coming to the sur face. The liberals ignore the bourgeois
      character of the system purged of feudalism, gloss over its
      contradictions and try to damp down the class struggle inherent in it.
     

      Let us consider these differences.
     

      The reformist and half-hearted character of the liberal agrarian
      programme is clearly apparent first of all from the fact that it
      does not go beyond “compulsory redemp tion”, and
      only “almost” unconditional at that, whereas the
      Social-Democratic agrarian programme demands the alien ation of
      the cut-off lands from their old owners without compensation,
      and countenances compensation only in spe cial cases, and then
      at the expense of the land of the nobility. Nor, as is well

      known,[1]

      do the Social-Democrats reject expropriation of the
      landed estates in their entirety, but only regard it as
      impermissible and irresponsible to include this demand, which is
      not appropriate under all circumstances, in the programme. The
      Social-Democrats from the very start call on the proletariat to
      take the first revolutionary step in conjunction with the
      well-to-do peasants in order then at once to go farther, either
      in conjunction with the peas ant bourgeoisie against the
      landlord class, or against the peasant bourgeoisie and the
      landlord class if they have joined forces. The liberals even at
      this stage, in the struggle against semi-feudal relations,
      shrink from class action and struggle. They want to entrust the
      reform to the “state” (forgetting the class
      character of the state) with the help of local self-government
      bodies and “ad hoc” commissions, drawing a
      parallel—nothing could be more
      characteristic—between the compulsory alienation of the
      cut-off lands and the compulsory alienation of land for building
      railways!!  Our liberals could not have more clearly expressed,
      or rather betrayed, their cherished wish of surrounding
      the new reform with the same “conveniences” for the
      ruling classes as always and everywhere attend the

    

      sale of land to the railways. And this in the same breath with
      the fine phrases about substituting a peasant democrat ic
      agrarian policy for the agrarian policy of an aristocratic
      caste! In order to effect that substitution in practice, you
      have to appeal, not to the “public interest”, but to
      the oppressed class—the peasantry—against the
      oppressing class—the nobility; you have to rouse the
      former against the latter, have to call for revolutionary action
      by the peas antry, not for reformist activity by the
      state. Farther, when they talk about abolishing semi-feudal
      relations, the liberals refuse to see the precise nature of the
      relations that they propose to purge of feudalism. Mr. L., for
      example, repeats the catchphrases of Mr. Nikolai—on,
      Mr. V. V. and the rest about “the principle of recognising
      the tiller’s right to the land he cultivates” and about
      the “virility” of the peasantry, but is modestly
      silent about the “principle” of bourgeois farming
      and the exploitation of wage-labour by these virile
      peasants. That it is the position of the petty-bourgeois members
      of the peasantry which would inevitably be strengthened and
      consolidated by the consistent application of democracy in the
      agrarian sphere, the bourgeois democrats do not and will not
      realise. In the proletarisation of the peasantry Mr. L. (again
      like the Narodniks and in the spirit of Revolutsionnaya
      Rossiya) refuses to see a “type of
      development”, declaring it to be due to “the
      survivals of serfdom” and “the general p athological
      condition of the countryside"! Presumably after we get a
      constitution we shall see the end of the growth of the towns, of
      the flight of the poor peasants from the countryside, of the
      change-over of the landlords from the labour-rent sys tem to the
      use of wage-labour, and so on! Depicting the beneficent effect
      of the French Revolution on the French peasantry, Mr. L. speaks
      glowingly of the disappearance of famines and the improvement
      and progress of agricul ture; but about the fact that this was
      bourgeois progress, based on the formation of a
      “stable” class of agricultural wage-labourers and on
      chronic pauperism of the mass of the lower strata of
      the peasantry, this Narodnik-like bour geois, of course, says
      never a word.
     

      In short, the difference between Mr. L. ’s agrarian pro gramme and the
      Social-Democratic agrarian programme reproduces

    

      in miniature with remarkable fidelity all the gen eral
      differences between the minimum programmes of liber al and
      proletarian democracy. Whether you consider these programmes as
      theoretically expounded by their respective ideologists or as
      practically applied by their respective parties and trends, or
      whether you look at the history of, say, 1848, you will find
      just these two fundamental differ ences between the liberal and
      the Social-Democratic approach to the immediate practical aims:
      on the one hand, reformist haif-heartedness in the struggle
      against the survivals of feudalism and a glossing over of the
      class antagonisms of “modern” society; on the other,
      a revolutionary struggle against the remnants of the old order
      with a view to extending, developing and intensifying the
      struggle of classes in the new society. Of course, these
      fundamental differ ences, which spring from the very nature of
      developing capitalist society, assume very different forms in
      different national states and at different times. An inability
      to rec ognise the “old” bourgeois democracy behind
      the new and peculiar forms is characteristic of its ideologists,
      con sistent and inconsistent. Under the latter head we must, for
      example, class Mr. P. Novobrantsev (see Revotutsion naya
      Rossiya, Nos. 32 and 33), that representative of “dis
      traught Narodism” who, in reference to Iskra’s
      attacks on Osvobozhdeniye for being a bourgeois class
      publication, ironically remarks: “A fine bourgeoisie, we
      must say!" “Mr. Struve," Revolul sionnaya Rossiga
      condescends to inform us, “is a representative of the
      ’intelligentsia’, and not of the ’bourgeoisie as a class’, for
      he does not set out to unite or lead any classes or social
      estates." That is all very well, gentlemen! But had you given a
      little thought to the matter you would have seen that Mr. Struve
      is a repre sentative of the bourgeois
      intelligentsia. As to the bour geoisie as a class, the Russian
      proletariat will see it as such on the historical scene only
      when there is political freedom and the government is almost
      directly a “commit tee” of one or another section of
      the bourgeoisie. And only “socialists by mistake”
      can fail to know that it is their duty to teach the working
      class to recognise the bourgeoisie both in its activities and in
      its ideas, both in its mature state and in its dreamy youth.
     
 

      As for dreaminess, Mr. Novobrantsev is your man for that. But our
      article is already so long, and Mr. Novo brantsev’s world outlook and
      agrarian-historical views present so much that is interesting,
      especially when taken parallel with those of Mr. L., that we must
      postpone their discussion until another time.

      The Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., meeting in Geneva on November
      27, 1903, unanimously adopted the following decision.
     

      Comrade Plekhanov’s co-optation of the Martovites to the
      editorial board constitutes outright defection on his part to
      the side of the Party Congress minority, a minority that
      Plekhanov himself more than once publicly character ised as
      inclining towards opportunism and anarchism. From the minutes of
      the Party Congress and the Congress of the League this will be
      seen quite clearly. This defection is a direct violation of the
      will of the Party Congress under the influence of the League
      Abeoad and in defiance of the emphatically stated decision of
      the majority of the Party committees in Russia. The Central
      Committee cannot allow such a violation of the will of the
      Congress, particularly since in taking advantage of Comrade
      Lenin’s resignation to commit this act, Comrade Plekhanov was
      guilty of a direct breach of trust; for Comrade Lenin resigned
      on cer tain conditions, in the interests of peace and good will
      in the Party, whereas the Martovites, by turning down the
      Central Committee’s ultimatum of

      November

 25,[2] rejected peace
      and
      thereby declared war.
     

      The Central Committee therefore, by revolutionary ac tion, takes the
      Party Central Organ into its own hands and declares that it will do
      everything in its power to secure that the will of the Party as a
      whole, not the will of the League Abroad or the treachery of an
      individual, shall determine the Party’s future.
     
Central Committee

 
Notes
 
 



[1]

      This Unissued Statement was proposed by Lenin as a decision of the
      Central Committee at a meeting of the latter on November 14 (27), 1903. It
      was not adopted because of the conciliationist attitude of some of the
      Central Committee members towards the Mensheviks.
   



[2]

The Central Committee’s ultimatum to the Mensheviks was present ed
      on November 12 (25), 1903. On October 22 (November 4) Lenin had sent the
      Central Committee a letter (present edition, Vol. 34) in which he proposed
      offering the Mensheviks the following conditions:
     

      1) co-optation of three of the ex-editors to the editorial board of the Central
      Organ;
     

      2) re-establishment of the status quo in the League Abroad;
     

      3) allowing the Mensheviks one seat on the Party Council.
     

      These initial conditions did not meet with the support of the con ciliationist
      members of the Central Committee. In the same letter Lenin outlined and
      proposed simultaneously approving but not yet presenting to the Mensheviks
      the main points of an ultimatum, that is, a statement of the practical
      concessions the Central Com mittee could permissibly make to them: 1)
      co-optation of the four ox-editors to the editorial board; 2) co-optation to
      the Cantral Committee of two members of the opposition, to be chosen by the
      Central Committee itself; 3) re-establishment of the status quo in the
      League; 4) allowing the Mensheviks one seat on the Party Council. “If
      the ultimatum is rejected," Lenin wrote, “then—war to a
      finish. An extra condition: 5) cessation of all talk, gossip, and arguments
      about the dissensions at the Second Party Congress and after." These
      proposals of Lenin’s (except the extra condition) were includ ed in the
      ultimatum of November 12 (25), but were toned down somewhat by the
      conciliationist members of the Central Committee.
     

The Mensheviks, whom Plekhanov helped greatly by co-opting all the ox-editors to
      the editorial hoard the day after the Central Committee’s ultimatum,
      rejected the ultimatum and took the way of open war against the majority of
      the Party.
     

An evaluation of the Central Committee’s ultimatum is given by Lenin in One Step Forward, Two Steps Back (pp. 375-77 of this
    volume).

      The article “What Should Not Be Done” raises issues
      in our Party life tbat are so important, and at this partic ular
      juncture so urgent, that it is difficult to repress the desire
      to respond immediately to the editorial board’s kind and
      hospitable offer to throw open the columns of their paper; and
      it is all the more difficult for one who has been a constant
      contributor to Iskra, especially at a time when to
      delay voicing one’s opinion for a week may mean forfeiting the
      opportunity altogether.
     

      And I would like to contribute my opinion in order to prevent certain
      possible, if not inevitable, misunderstand ings.
     

      Let me say, first of all, that I think the author of the article
      is a thousand times right when he insists that it is essential
      to safeguard the unity of the Party and avoid new
      splits—especially over differences which cannot be con
      sidered important. To appeal for peaceableness, mildness, and
      readiness to make concessions is highly praiseworthy in a leader
      at all times, and at the present moment in par ticular. To
      anathemise or expel from the Party, not only former

 Economists,[2] but even little
      groups of Social-Democrats who suffer from “a certain
      inconsistency”

      would certainly be unreasonable, so unreasonable that we quite
      understand the irritable tone of the author of the article
      towards those whom he considers arbitrary, stiff-necked and
      stupid

 Sobakeviches[3] capable of
      advocating expul

      sion. We even go further: when we have a Party programme and a
      Party organisation, we must not only hospitably throw open the
      columns of the Party organ for exchanges of opinion, but must
      afford those groups—or grouplets, as the author calls
      them—which from inconsistency support some of the dogmas
      of revisionism, or for one reason or

    

      another insist upon their separate and individual existence as
      groups, the opportunity of systematically setting forth their
      differences, however slight these may be. Precisely in order to
      avoid being too harsh and stiff-necked d la Sobakevich
      towards “anarchistic individualism”, it is
      necessary, in our opinion, to do the utmost—even if it
      involves a certain departure from tidy patterns of centralism
      and from absolute obedience to discipline—to enable these
      grouplets to speak out and give the whole Party the opportunity
      to weigh the importance or unimportance of these differences and
      determine just where, how and on whose part
      inconsistency is shown.
     

      Indeed, it is high time to make a clean sweep of the tra ditions
      of circle sectarianism and—in a party which rests on the
      masses—resolutely advance the slogan: More
      light/—let the Party know everything, let it
      have all, abso lutely all the material required for a
      judgement of all and sundry differences, reversions to
      revisionism, departures from discipline, etc. More confidence in
      the independent judgement of the whole body of Party
      workers!—they, and they alone, will be able to curb the
      excessive hothead edness of grouplets inclined to splits, will
      be able, by their slow, imperceptible but persistent influence,
      to imbue them with the “good will” to observe Party
      discipline, will be able to cool the ardour of anarchistic
      individualism and, by the very fact of their indifference,
      document, prove and demonstrate the triviality of differences
      exaggerated Thy the elements tending towards a split.
     

      To the question—"what should not be done?" (what should
      not be done in general, and what, in particular, should not be
      done so as to avoid a split), my reply is, first of all: do not
      conceal from the Party the appearance and growth of potential
      causes of a split, do not conceal any of the circumstances and
      events that constitute such causes; and, what is more, do not
      conceal them not only from the Party, but, as far as possible,
      from the outside public either. I say “as far as
      possible” having in mind the things that, in a secret
      organisation, must necessarily be concealed— hut in our
      splits things of this kind play next to no part. Broad
      publicity—that is the surest, the only reliable means of
      avoiding such splits as can be avoided, and of

    

      reducing to a minimum the harm of splits that are no longer avoidable.
     

      For indeed, just reflect on the obligations devolving on the
      Party from the fact that it is dealing now with the
      masses, not with mere circles. To be a party of the
      masses not only in name, wg must get ever wider masses to share
      in all Party affairs, steadily elevating them from political
      indifference to protest and struggle, from a general spirit of
      protest to the conscious adoption of Social-Democratic views,
      from the adoption of these views to support of the movement,
      from support to organised membership in the Party. Can we
      achieve this result without giving the widest publicity to
      matters on whose decision the nature of our influence on the
      masses will depend? The workers will cease to understand us and
      will desert us, as a general staff without an army, if splits
      take place in our ranks over trivial differences, says the
      author; and it is quite true. And in order that the workers
      may not cease to understand us, in order that their
      fighting experience and proletarian instinct may teach
      us “leaders” something too, the
      organised workers must learn to keep an eye on any potential
      causes of splits (in any mass party such causes have always
      arisen and will always recur), to properly evaluate these
      causes, to appraise what happens in some
      “backwater”, in Russia or abroad, from the
      standpoint of the interests of the entire Party, of the entire
      movement.
     

      The author is thrice justified when he stresses that much will
      be given to our central bodies and much will be asked of
      them. Just so. And for that very reason the whole Party
      must constantly, steadily and systematically train
      suitable persons for the central bodies, must see clearly, as in
      the palm of its hand, all the activities of every
      candidate for these high posts, must come to know even their
      personal characteristics, their strong and weak points, their
      victo ries and “defeats”. The author makes some
      remarkably acute observations, evidently based on extensive
      experience, about some of the causes of such defeats. And just
      because these observations are so acute, it is necessary that
      the whole Party should benefit by them, that it should
      always see every “defeat”, even if partial,
      of one or other of its “leaders”. No political
      leader has a career that is without its

    

      defeats, and if we are serious vhen we talk about influencing
      the masses, about winning their “good will”, we must
      strive with all our might not to let these defeats be hushed up
      in the musty atmosphere of circles and grouplets, but to have
      them submitted to the judgement of all. That may appear
      embarrassing at first sight, it may seem “offensive”
      sometimes to individual leaders—but we must overcome this
      false feeling of embarrassment, it is our duty to the Party and
      to the working class. In this way, and in this way alone, shall
      we enable the whole body of influential Party workers (and not
      the chance assortment of persons in a circle or grouplet) to
      know their leaders and to put each of them in his proper
      category. Only broad publicity will correct all bigoted,
      one-sided, capricious deviations, it alone will convert the at
      times absurd and ridiculous “squalls” between
      “grouplets” into useful and essential material for
      the self-education of the Party.
     

      Light, more light! We need a vast orchestra; and we must acquire
      experience in order correctly to distribute the parts, in order
      to know to whom to assign the sentimen tal violin, to whom the
      gruff double-bass, to whom the con ductor’s haton. Let the
      columns of the Party organ and of all Party publications indeed
      be thrown open hospitably to all opinions, in keeping with the
      author’s admirable appeal; let all and sundry judge our
      “janglings and wran glings” over any
      “note” sounded too sharp, in the opinion of some,
      too flat, in the opinion of others, too raggedly, in the opinion
      of others still. Only through a series of such open discussions
      can we get a really harmonious ensemble of leaders; only given
      this condition will it he impossible for the workers to
      cease to understand us; only then will our “general
      staff” really be backed by the good and con
      scious will of an army that follows and at the same time
      directs its general staff!

Notes
 
 



[1]

      This Letter to “Iskra” was written by Lenin in reply to
      Plekhanov’s article “What Should Not Be Done” in Iskra,
      No. 52 (November 7, 1903).
   



[2]

Economism was the opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at
      the turn of the century, a Russian variety of international oppor tunism;
      its organs were the newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Worker’s Thought;
      1897-1902), published in Russia, and the journal Ra bocheye Dyelo
      (Workers’ Cause; 1899-1902), published abroad.
     

      The Economists restricted the tasks of the working-class move ment to the
      economic struggle for higher wages, better working conditions, etc.,
      asserting that the political struggle was the busi ness of the liberal
      bourgeoisie, and denied the leading role of the workers’ party, which, they
      considered, should merely observe the spontaneous development of the
      movement and follow in its wake. In their glorifying of
      “spontaneity” they belittled the importance of revolutionary
      theory and consciousness, declaring that the social ist ideology could grow
      out of the spontaneous movement; and by thus denying the need to imbue the
      workers’ movement with socialist consciousness, they cleared the way for
      bourgeois ideology. They championed the scattered, isolated circles, with
      their parochi al amateurish approach, fostering disunity, confusion, and
      wavering in the Social-Democratic ranks and opposing the creation of a
      centralised working-class party. Economism threatened to divert the working
      class from the revolutionary, class path and re duce it to a political
      appendage of the bourgeoisie.
     

      The Economists’ programme was set forth in the Credo, a mani festo
      drawn up in 1899 by Y. D. Kuskova. When this Credo reached Lenin,
      then in exile in Siberia, he replied with A Protest by Russian
      Social-Democrats—a trenchant criticism of the Economist
      ideas. This protest was discussed and unanimously adopted by a meeting of 17
      Marxists serviiig terms of political exile, held in the village of
      Yermakovskoye, Minusinsk Region.
     

      A major part in the fight against Economism was played by Lenin’s
      Iskra; and by his book What Is To Be Done?, published in
      March 1902, Lenin completed its ideological defeat.

      This is by no means a personal question. It concerns the relations
      between the majority and minority of our Party Congress, and I am
      bound to answer it at once, and openly, not only because the majority
      delegates are bombarding me with questions, but because the article
      “Our Congress” in No. 53 of Iskra gives an
      entirely false picture of the not very profound but very
      disruptive division among the Iskra-ists to which the
      Congress led.
     

      The account the article gives of the matter is such that even
      with a magnifying glass no one could discover in it a
      single really serious cause for the division, could
      find so much as a shadow of an explanation of such a phenomenon
      as the altered composition of the editorial board of the Central
      Organ, or a semblance of valid reasons for my resignation from
      the board. We parted company over the organisation of the
      Party’s central bodies, the writer of the article says, over the
      relations between the Central Organ and the Central Committee,
      over the way to apply centralism, over the limits and nature of
      a possible and useful centralisation, over the harm of
      bureaucratic formalism.
     

      Is that so? Did we not rather part company over the
      personal composition of the central bodies, over whether it was
      permissible, because one did not like the membership elected to
      them by the Congress, to boycott these central bodies, to
      disrupt the practical work, to revise the decisions of the Party
      Congress at the bidding of a circle of Social-
      Democrats abroad, such as the majority of the League?
     
 

      You know perfectly well, comrades, that this was indeed the
      case. But the great majority of the most influential and most
      active Party workers do not know it yet, and so I shall briefly
      outline the main facts—briefly because, judging by an
      announcement in No. 53 of Iskra, all the material
      relating to the history of our divergence will shortly be
      published.
     

      At our Congress—as both the writer of the article we are
      discussing and the Bund delegation in their newly published
      report rightly point out—the
      “Iskra-ists” were in a considerable
      majority, about three-fifths, according to my calculation, even
      before the withdrawal of the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo
      delegates. During the first half of the Congress these
      Iskra-ists stood together against all the
      anti-Iskra-ists and inconsistent Iskra-ists. This was
      very plainly revealed in connection with two incidents during
      the first half of the Congress which are important for an
      understanding of our divergence: the Organising Committee
      incident and the equality of languages incident (the latter was
      the only occasion when the Iskra-ist compact majority
      dropped—from three-fifths to one-half). During the second
      half of the Congress the Iskra-ists began to diverge,
      and by the end of the Congress the divergence was
      complete. The controversies over Paragraph I of the
      Party Rules and over the elections to the central bodies clearly
      reveal the nature of this divergence: a minority of the
      Iskra-ists (headed by Martov) became the rallying point
      for a steadily increasing number of non-Iskra-ists and
      indecisive elements, in opposition to the majority of the
      Iskra-ists (which included Plekhanov and myself). Over
      the question of Para graph I of the Rules this grouping did not
      yet take final shape, but even so the Bundist votes and two of
      the three Rabocheye Dyelo-ist votes gave the
      Iskra-ist minority the upper hand. In the elections to
      the central bodies the Iskra ist majority (owing to the
      withdrawal from the Congress of the five Bundist and two
      Rabocheye Dyelo-ist votes) became the majority at the
      Party Congress. And it was only at this point that we parted
      company in the real sense of the term.
     

      We disagreed profoundly, first of all, over the composition of the
      Central Committee. After the Organising Committee incident, at the
      very beginning of the Congress, the

    

      Iskra-ists hotly discussed various members (and non
members) of the Organising Committee as candidates for the
      Central Committee, and at unofficial meetings of the Iskra
      organisation, after prolonged and heated debates, rejected one of the
      candidates supported by Martov by nine votes to four, with three
      abstentions; by ten votes to two, with four abstentions, a list of
      five was adopted which, on my proposal, included one leader
      of the non-Iskra-ist elements and one leader of the
      Iskra-ist minority. But the minority insisted on having three
      out of five, and as a result suffered complete defeat at the Party
      Congress. The great battle at the Congress over whether to endorse the
      old editorial board of six for the Central Organ or to elect a new

 trio[2]

ended in the same way.
     

Only from this moment did the divergence become so
      complete as to suggest a split; only from this moment did the
      minority (now already become a real “compact”
      minority) take the course of abstaining from voting—a
      thing
      until then unwitnessed at the Congress. And after the Congress
      this divergence grew ever more acute. The discontented minority
      resorted to a boycott, lasting for months. It is quite obvious
      that the charges of bureaucratic formalism, of demanding
      unquestioning, automatic obedience, and suchlike nonsense, which
      sprang from this soil, were merely an attempt to lay the blame
      at the wrong door; and this is sufficiently borne out by the
      following typical case. The new editorial board (i.e., Plekhanov
      and myself) invited all the former editors to contribute, which
      invitation, of course, was at first made without any
      “formalism”, by word of mouth. It met with a
      refusal. We then wrote an “official

    

      document” (what bureaucrats!), addressed “dear
      comrades”, requesting them to contribute in general, and
      in particular to set forth their di erences in the columns
      of the publications of which we were the editors. The reply
      was a “formal” statement to the effect that they
      did not wish to have anything to do with
      “Iskra”. And, in fact, for months on end none
      of the non-editors did any work for Iskra. Relations
      became exclusively formal and bureaucratic—but on whose
      “initiative"?
     

      Underground literature began to be produced; people abroad were
      flooded with it, it was disseminated among the committees, and
      is now already beginning in part to return from Russia. The
      report of the delegate for Siberia, — n’s letter on the
      slogans of the “opposition”, and Martov’s Once
      More in the Minority are all full of the most amusing
      charges against Lenin of being an “autocrat”, of
      instituting a Robespierre guillotine regime (sic!), of
      having staged the political burial of old comrades (non election
      to the central bodies is burial!), and the like. By the very
      logic of things the opposition is drawn to seeking such
      differences of “principle” on matters of
      organisation as entirely preclude collaboration. An especially
      loud
      outcry is raised over the celebrated “fifth member”
      of the Party Council. In all these writings, the Council is made
      out to he a piece of diplomacy or trickery on Lenin’s part, an
      instrument for the suppression of the Central Committee in
      Russia by the Central Organ abroad—which is exactly the
      way the matter is depicted by the Bund delegation in their
      report on the Congress. It need hardly be said that this
      difference of principle is just as nonsensical as the famous
      bureaucratic formalism. The fifth member is elected by the
      Congress; consequently, it is all a matter of the
      person who enjoys the greatest confidence of the
      majority; and the will of the majority of a Party Congress will
      always, however the central Party bodies may be constituted, he
      manifested in the choice of definite persons.
     

      How widely this kind of literature has been circulated abroad is
      evident from the fact that even the good Parvus has taken the
      war-path against the attempt to grasp all the threads in one hand and
      to “boss” (sic!) the workers from some such place
      as Geneva (Aus de’

Weltpolitik,[7] V. Jahrgang,

    

      No. 48, November 30, 1903). In a month or two, when he reads the
      minutes of the Party Congress and.the League Congress, our new enemy
      of autocracy will discover how easy it is to make a fool of oneself by
      accepting all manner of

Parteiklatsch[3]

at its face value.
     

      The climax of the opposition’s campaign against the central bodies
      was the Congress of the League. From its minutes the reader will be
      able to see whether those who called it an arena for settling Party
      Congress scores were right or not, and whether or not there was
      anything in the onslaught of the opposition to provoke the Central
      Commit tee to altogether exceptional measures (as the Central
      Committee itself put it vhen alteration of the composition of
      the
      editorial board held out the hope of peace in the Party). The
      resolutions of this Congress reveal the true nature of the differences
      of “principle” over the question of autocratic
      bureaucracy.
     

      After the League Congress a split loomed so threateningly that
      Plekhanov decided to co-opt the ex-editors. I foresaw that the
      opposition would not rest satisfied with this, and I did not
      think it permissible to revise a decision of the Party Congress
      to please a circle. But still less did I think it
      permissible to stand in the way of possible peace in the Party,
      and I therefore resigned from the editorial board, after the
      51st issue of Iskra, stating at the same time that I
      did not refuse to continue as a contributor, and that I did not
      even insist, if peace and good will were established in the
      Party, on having my resignation made public. The opposition
      demanded (not transformation of the non-existent system of
      bureaucracy, formalism, autocracy, automatism, etc., but)
      reinstatement of the old editorial board, the co-optation of
      opposition representatives to the Central Committee, two seats
      on the Council, and recognition of the League Congress as
      lawful. The Central Committee made an offer of peace by
      consenting to co-opt two of them, to turn over one seat on the
      Council, to have the reorganisation of the League carried out
      gradually. These terms too the opposition rejected. The editors were
      co-opted, but peace remained an open question. That was the state of
      affairs when No. 53 of Iskra appeared.
     
 

      That the Party wants peace and positive work is hardly open to
      question. But articles like “Our Congress” are an
      obstacle to peace, an obstacle because they bring up hints and
      fragments of issues which are not and cannot be comprehensible
      unless the story of the divergence is told in full; an obstacle
      because they shift the blame from a foreign circle to the centre
      in charge of our practical work, which is engaged in the
      difficult and arduous task of actually uniting the Party, and
      which in any case has been having to wrestle with too many
      hindrances to the application of centralism. The committees in
      Russia are fighting against the disruptive activities and
      boycott tactics of the minority, which are obstructing the work
      all along the line. Resolutions to this effect have already
      come in from the St. Petersburg, Moscow, Nizhni-Novgorod, Tver,
      Odessa, and Tula committees and from the Northern League.
     

      Enough of this 6migr6

      Literatengeiink![4]

Let it now be come an
      example to the practical workers in Russia of “what should
not ho done"! Let the editors of the Party’s Central Organ call
      for a stop to all boycotts, no matter on whose part, and for concerted
      effort under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party!
     
 *     *  * 

      But what about the difference in shades of opinion among the
      Iskra-ists? the reader may ask. Our answer will be: in
      the first place, the difference is that in the opinion of the
      majority one can and should advocate one’s views in the Party
      apart from any alteration in the personal composition of the
      central bodies. Every circle, even of Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ists, is entitled, on joining the Party, to demand
      the opportunity to express and advocate its views; but no
      circle, not even of generals, is entitled to demand
      representation on the Party’s central bodies. In the second
      place, the
      difference is that in the opinion of the majority the blame for
      any formalism and bureaucracy falls on those who, by refusing to
      work under the leadership of the central bodies, made it
      difficult to conduct matters in a non- formalistic way. In the
      third place, I know of one and only
    

one difference of principle on matters of organisation,
      namely, that which found expression in the debate on Paragraph
      I of the Party Rules. We shall endeavour to return to this
      question when the minutes of the Congress appear. We shall then
      show that the fact that Martov’s formulation was carried with
      the help of non-Iskra-ist and quasi-Iskra ist elements
      was no accident, but was due to its being a step towards
      opportunism, and that this step is even more apparent in
      —n’s letter and in Once More in the

    Minority.[5]

      The minutes will show that the author of “Our Congress  
      goes against the facts when he claims that “the
      controversy during the discussion of the Party Rules centred
      almost exclusively round the organisation of the central bodies
      of the Party”. Quite the contrary. The only controversy
      that really involved principles and divided the two
      “sides” (i.e., the majority and minority of the
      Iskra-ists) at all definitely was over Paragraph I of
      the Party Rules. As for the controversies over the composition
      of the Council, co-optation to the central bodies, and so on,
      they were just controversies between individual delegates,
      between Martov and myself, etc.; they concerned what were
      relatively very minor details and did not give rise to any
      definite grouping of the Iskra-ists, who by their votes
      corrected now one, now another of us when he went too far. To
      make out that these controversies were the source of our
      disagreement on how centralism should be applied, what should be
      its limits, character, etc., is simply to whitewash the stand
      taken by the minority and the methods of the fight which they
      carried on to change the personal composition of the central
      bodies, and which alone caused us to diverge in the full sense
      of the term.
     

 
Notes
 

[1]

 I sent this letter to Iskra immediately after No. 53 appeared. The editors refused to print it in No. 54, 50 I am compelled to publish it as a leaflet. —Lenin

[2]

In view of the endless talk and misrepresentation that there has been
regarding this celebrated “trio”, let me point out at once that long
before the Congress all comrades who were at all closely in touch were
acquainted with my commentary to the draft Tagesordnung of the
Congress. This commentary, which was circulated at the Congress, contained
the following point: “The Congress shall elect three persons to the
editorial board of the Central Organ and three to the Central
Committee. These six persons in conjunction shall, if necessary,
co opt by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the editorial
board of the Central Organ and to the Central Committee and report to this
effect to the Congress. After the report has been endorsed by the Congress,
subsequent co-optation shall be effected by the editorial board of the
Central Organ and by the Central Committee separately."  —Lenin

[3]

Party tittle-tattle.—Ed. 

[4]

Writers’ squabbling—Ed. 

[5]

We shall then also ask to have explained what the author of "Our
Congress” means by talking about an undeserved disregard for the
non-Iskra-ists, and about the strict points of the Rules not
corresponding to the actual relation of forces in the Party. What do these
assertions refer to?  —Lenin
 



[6]

      This Letter to the Editors of “Iskra” played a big part
      in exposing the opportunist tactics of the Mensheviks, their disruptive
      activity at the Second Party Congress and after it. After the Menshevik
      editors refused pusillanimously to print the “Letter” in
      Iskra. the Bolsheviks published it in leaflet form. It had a wide
      circulation in Russia, where it was illegally reprinted. Police documents
      for 1904-05 show that copies were found during house-searches and arrests in
      Moscow, Kharkov, Tula, Tomsk, Riga, Nikolayev, Poltava, Astrakhan, and the
      Donbas coalfield.

      Comrades,
 

      The final unification of the Party now makes it essential and urgent
      to develop on a wide scale the activities conduct ed by the
      Social-Democrats abroad and firmly unite the efforts of all working in
      this field.
     

      Under the Party Rules (Paragraph 13), all Party work abroad is
      divided into two major spheres, organised on different lines. On
      the one hand, propaganda and agitation activities abroad are
      under the direct charge of the League Abroad and are
      concentrated in its hands. The Central Committee will take all
      measures to facilitate the complete centralisation of this work
      in the hands of the League and to assure it autonomy in the
      exercise of this function. On the other hand, assistance by the
      League to the movement in Russia is rendered only through
      persons and groups specially appointed for the purpose by the
      Central Committee.
     

      While calling upon all members of the League, all aid groups and all
      Party members abroad to give the League the utmost support in its work
      of propaganda and agitation, the Central Committee intends now to
      focus its efforts on the organisation of these intermediate groups
      through which assistance to the movement in Russia should be rendered.
     

      The Central Committee considers its tasks in this field to be as
      follows.
     
 

      Assistance to the Russian movement from abroad will chiefly take the
      form of 1) dispatching revolutionary workers to Russia; 2) dispatching
      to Russia funds collected abroad; 3) gathering abroad such Russian
      contacts, items of news, and information as need to be communicated
      speedily to Russia with a view to aiding the comrades active there,
      preventing discovery and arrest, etc.; 4) dispatching literature to
      Russia, etc.
     

      While not claiming that this is an exhaustive list of all forms of
      direct assistance to the Russian movement from abroad, we think,
      however, that it is sufficient for the time being to outline the chief
      forms and adapt the organisation we are creating to these. Experience
      will show how far this organisation will need to be modified in the
      future.
     

      To begin with the matter of dispatching people for work in
      Russia. It would, of course, be desirable for most comrades
      going there to contact directly the Central Committee’s chief
      agency abroad—in Geneva—and secure from it
      addresses, passwords, funds and the necessary instructions. But
      many of the people going will naturally not be able to come to
      Geneva, and the Central Committee therefore intends to appoint
      its agents in all foreign centres of any importance: London,
      Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, and others. Every person
      intending to leave for work in Russia is invited to apply to the
      local agent of the Central Committee, who will take all measures
      to enable him to reach his destination with maximum speed and
      safety and to co-ordinate his first steps with the Central
      Committee’s general plan of allocation of forces and funds,
      etc. The Central Committee hopes that the League Abroad will
      render these Central Committee agents every assistance—for
      example, by acquainting as many as possible of
      our people abroad with the functions of these agents and the
      conditions for contacting them, by helping to arrange for
      maximum secrecy of these contacts, etc.
     

      Since the dispatch of people to Russia from large foreign centres is a
      very big job, and since one person may not always be able to acquaint
      himself adequately with those being dispatched, the Central Committee
      will, where required, appoint not one agent, but .a group of agents,
      in accordance with Paragraph 13 of the Party Rules.
     
 

      Further, as regards the dispatch of funds, the most desirable
      arrangement is for the collection of funds anywhere abroad to be
      completely concentrated in the hands of the League and for the
      Administration of the League to pass them over to the Central
      Committee. Only in urgent cases may we be obliged, as experience
      suggests, to have certain sums handed over directly by local
      sections of the League to local agents of the Central Committee,
      as when pressure of circumstances requires immediate aid in
      effecting an escape, in dispatching a person or literature,
      etc. The Central Committee hopes that the Administration of the
      League will give appropriate instructions to the sections and
      will devise the most suitable forms of accounting for sums
      collected and expended.
     

      Next, it is common knowledge, of course, that persons arriving
      abroad from Russia very often communicate information which
      would be of the utmost importance to those working in Russia,
      as, for example, about the extent of arrests, the need to warn
      comrades in places remote from the scene of an arrest, the need
      to utilise contacts in Russia which the comrade escaping or
      otherwise leaving had no time or opportunity to utilise, etc. Of
      course, in proportion as all the Party work comes under the
      direction of the Central Committee, it will become increasingly
      possible to gather all such contacts and information in Russia
      itself, which is the only normal and desirable thing. But there
      is no doubt that for a long time yet there will be cases when
      comrades escaping from or legally leaving Russia will not
      manage, for one reason or another, to pass on their contacts in
      Russia, so that this will have to be done after they arrive
      abroad.
     

      Lastly, the Central Committee will, of course, endeavour to
      concentrate the transport of literature as completely as
      possible in the bands of a special transport group, some of
      whose members will be abroad all the time. Special Central
      Committee agents will therefore be appointed to manage the Party
      literature depots in various foreign centres, to maintain
      communication with the frontiers, etc. But how ever efficiently
      the business of transport is organised, there will always, of
      course, be gaps which will have to be filled by seizing such
      chances as may present themselves,

    

      by (perhaps) dispatching suitcases,. utilising opportunities which may
      be offered by commercial or shipping arrangements, etc. All
      communications and items of information bearing on such matters should
      likewise be addressed to the Central Committee agents, with whom all
      such matters will be concentrated and who will act in accordance with
      the Central Committee’s general plan and instructions.
     

      In informing the League Administration of its plan of work, the
      Central Committee expresses its confidence that the League for its
      part will render every assistance to the Central Committee agents
      abroad, and in particular will take steps to enable these agents to
      acquaint themselves widely with the aid groups, youth circles, etc.,
      etc.

      What angers me most in the position taken up by the
      “Martovite” Iskra is its intrinsic
      dishonesty and falsehood, the attempt to evade the essence
      of the matter, the attempt to falsify Party opinion and
      judgement, to misrepresent concepts and facts. And I
      think that the obtuseness and indifference shown by some
      comrades, their insensitiveness to this falsehood, can only be
      due to their ignorance of the facts. Ignorance must be combated
      by explanation, and I shall certainly keep to my intention of
      explaining the whole matter in the greatest detail (if
      necessary, with all the documents) in a special
      pamphlet, which I shall undertake as soon as the minutes of the
      Party and League Congresses come out, that is to say, very

 soon.[1]


      The chief distortion by which the Martovites try to
      deceive the Party (in their hysterical state very possibly,
      and even probably, primarily deceiving themselves) is, firstly,
      misrepresentation of the true sources and causes of the
      divergence among the Iskra-ists, and, secondly, mis- rep
resentation of the concepts of circle spirit and disruption, of
      sectarianism and party spirit.
     

      The first misrepresentation is that they represent as a difference of
      “principle” the recriminations—for that is
      what they actually were—exchanged by the two sides after the
      Congress, during the struggle between the central bodies and the
      opposition. These recriminations consisted in the opposition calling
      the majority autocrats, formalists, bureaucrats, etc., while the
      majority called the opposition hysterical place-seekers, a
      party of rejected Ministers or hysterical rowdies (vide the
      Congress of the League). And now a n e side of these mutual
      “compliments” is being held

    

      up in the Central Organ as a difference of principle! Isn’t
      that despicable?
     

      In reality the cause of the divergence was the Martov ites’
swing-over to vards the Marsh. That swing-over was clearly to be
      seen at the Congress in the matter of Paragraph I of the
      Rules and in the grouping in the elections to the central
      bodies. This difference, which in a measure certainly was one
      of principle, is evaded and hushed up.
     

      The second misrepresentation is that, when it is they who have
for three months been disrupting the whole
Party and all the work in the interests of a circle,
in order to worm themselves into the central bodies (for no
one ever restrict ed genuine controversy or the free
expression of opinion; on the contrary, the Martovites were
invited and urged to write), the Martovites now, after getting
into the editorial board by the back door, bring forward the
ludicrous accusation that the majority is disruptively
formalistic, bureaucratic, etc., saying nothing about
their own boycott, their place-seeking, etc. Isn’t that
despicable? Either—or; either consign the whobe
“squabble” to oblivion, and in that case
don’t talk about it at all, do not countenance in the
Central Organ any recrudescence of the
squabble—for this outcry about bureaucracy is
precisely a recrudescence of wretched place-seeking;
or raise the question of the diver gence, and in that case
disclose everything.

A Letter to a

      Comrade,[1]

      here reprinted, was written over a year ago—in September
      1902, if my memory does not deceive me. At first it passed from
      hand to hand in manuscript copies and circulated in Russia as a
      statement of Iskra’s views on organisation. Then, last
      June, the Siberian League printed and distributed it in quite a
      large number of copies. It is thus already fully a matter of
      public knowledge and there are no longer any grounds for
      withholding its publication. The reason I had for not publishing
      it before—its very unfinished literary form, it being only
      a “rough draft” in the fullest sense of the
      term—now lapses, for it is in this rough state that many
      practical workers in Russia have read it. Furthermore, an even
      weightier reason for reprinting it in its rough form (I have
      made only the most essential stylistic corrections) is that it
      has now acquired the significance of a

 “document”.[2]

      As we know, the new editorial board of Iskra already
      announced in No. 53 the existence of differences over questions
      of organisation. Unfortunately, the editors are in no
      hurry to specify just what these differences are, confining
      themselves for the most part to hinting at things unknown.
     

      Something must be done to help the new editorial board in its
      difficult task. Let the old organisational views of
      Iskra be made known in all their details, down even to

    

      rough drafts; perhaps the new editorial board will then finally
      reveal its new organisational views to the Party under
      its “ideological direction”. Perhaps it will then
      finally confide to us the precise formulation of the
      fundamental changes it would like to have made in our Party’s
      Rules of Organisation. For, indeed, who does not understand that
      it is these Rules of Organisation that embody the organisational
      plans we have always had?
     

      If the reader compares What Is To Be

Done?[3]

and the
      Iskra articles on organisational matters with the
      Letter to a Comrade, and the latter with the Rules
      adopted at the Second Congress, he will be able to form a clear
      idea of how consistently we, the majority of the
      Iskra-ists and the majority at the Party Congress, have
      pursued our organisational “line”. As to the new
      editorial board of Iskra, we shall be waiting, and with
      the greatest impatience, for a statement of its new
      organisational views; we shall be waiting for it to indicate
      just what it has been disillusioned in, and since when, and why
      it has begun to “burn the idols it worshipped”.

      My opponents having repeatedly expressed the wish to avail

      positively
      —how shall I put it mildly?—awkward to introduce any
      changes when reprinting it.

      The editors of Iskra state in its 55th issue that the
      Central Committee and the opposition “agreed to consign to
      oblivion” the facts mentioned in my “Letter to the
      Editors of Iskra” ("Why I Resigned from the
      Iskra Editorial

       Board").[1]

This statement of the editors
      is an evasion which (to use Comrade Axelrod’s admirable style)
      really is formalistic, official and bureaucratic. In reality
      there was no such agreement, as the Central Committee’s
      foreign representative has plainly stated in a leaflet
      published immediately following the appearance of the 55th issue
      of Iskra. And there could not have been any
      such agreement, as should be clear to anyone who reads my letter
      attentively; for the opposition rejected the
      “peace and good will” offered by the Central
      Committee, one condition of which would certainly have
      been to consign to oblivion everything that deserved it. When
      the editors rejected the peace offer and declared war on the
      famous bureaucracy in No. 63, can they have been so naive
      as to hope that the other side would keep quiet about the
      real origin of these fables about
      bureaucracy?
     

      The editors were very much displeased when I described the real origin
      of these fables as squabbling (Literatenge
      zäink—writers’ squabbling). And no wonder! But, after all, you
      cannot dispose of this truly unpleasant fact by mouthing sorry phrases
      about it.
     

      We will take the liberty of asking our worthy editors two questions.
     
 

First question. Why is one person merely
      amused by the most violent charges of being an
      autocrat, of instituting a Robespierre regime, of staging a
      coup, and so on and so forth, while others are mortally
      offended by a calm statement reciting the facts and
      telling of a demand for generals’ posts that actually was put
      forward—so offended as to indulge in absolutely
      “rubbishy” talk about “personalities”,
      “moral aspersions”, and even “low”
      (where did they get that from??) “motives"? Why this
      difference, my good friends? Not because the “post”
      of general is “lower” than that of autocrat, surely?
     

Second question. Why don’t the editors explain to the
      reader why (in that remote past when they belonged to
      the opposition and really were “in the minority") they
      expressed the desire to have certain facts consigned to
      oblivion? Do not the editors think that the very idea of
      desiring to “consign to oblivion” differences of
      principle is absurd and could not have occurred to any
      right-minded person?
     

      So you see how clumsy you are, my dear “political opponents"!
      You wanted to annihilate me with the charge that it was I
      who was reducing a dispute over principles to the level
      of a squabble; instead, you have only confirmed my contention
      as to the real origin of some of your “differences of
      opinion”.
     

      Further, while admitting, out of clumsiness, that there were
      squabbles, the editors do not trouble to explain to the reader
      where, in their opinion, the difference of principle ends and
      the squabbling begins. They pass over the fact that in my letter
      I endeavour to draw a perfectly clear line between the
      two. I show there that the difference of principle (which was by
      no means so profound as to cause a real divergence)
      arose over Paragraph I of the Rules and was widened by the
      Iskra-ist minority joining forces with the
      non-Iskra-ist elements towards the end of the
      Congress. I further show that the talk about bureaucracy,
      formalism and the rest is chiefly just an echo of
      squabbles that occurred after the Congress.
     

      The editors probably do not agree with this demarcation
      between what relates to “principle” and what should be
      “consigned to oblivion”. Then why have they not troubled
      to give their own opinion as to what a “correct”
      demarcation

    

      between them would be? Is it not because they have not yet drawn (and
      cannot draw) any line between the two things in their own minds?
     

      From the article by our esteemed Comrade Axelrod in this same
      55th issue of Iskra the reader may judge what
      this... inability to discriminate leads to and what our Central
      Party Organ is turning into. Comrade Axelrod does not say a
      single word about the substance of our controversy over
      Paragraph I of the Rules, but confines himself to hints about
      “peripheral societies” that mean absolutely nothing
      to anyone who was not at the Congress. Comrade Axelrod has
      probably forgotten how long and closely we argued over
      Paragraph I!—but, on the other hand, he has evolved a
      “theory” to the effect that “the majority of
      the Iskra-ists at the Congress were convinced that
      their main task was... to fight the internal
      enemy”. “In the face of this mission”, our
      esteemed Comrade Axelrod is firmly convinced, “the
      immediate positive task became overshadowed” in the eyes
      of the majority. “The prospects of positive work were
      relegated to the dim remoteness of an indefinite future”;
      the
      Party was faced with the more urgent “military task of
      pacifying the internal enemy”. And Comrade Axelrod cannot
      find words severe enough to brand this

    “bureaucratic[2]

[or
      mechanical] centralism”, these “Jacobin” (!!?)
      plans, these “disrupters” who “repress and
      persecute” people as “mutineers”.
     

      In order to demonstrate the true worth of this theory— or,
      rather, of these accusations against the Congress majority of a
      disruptive tendency to repress mutiny (imaginary
      mutiny, it is to be supposed) and of ignoring positive work, I
      have only to remind the forgetful Comrade Axelrod of
      one (to begin with) little fact. On October 6,1903,
      after repeatedly pleading with the members of the minority on
      account of the stupidity and disruptiveness of their boycott,
      Plekhanov and I officially invited the
      “mutinous” writers

    

      (Comrade Axelrod among them) to get down to positive work; we
      officially told them that it was unreasonable to withdraw from this
      work, whether because of personal irritation or of differences of
      opinion (for an exposition of which we were throwing open the
      columns of our

    publications).[3]


      Comrade Axelrod has forgotten this. He has forgotten that his reply
      then was a flat refusal, without any reasons stated. He has forgotten
      that in his view at that time, in those distant days, “positive
      work was relegated to the dim remoteness of an indefinite
      future”, which future became a much-desired present only on
      November 26,

 1903.[4]


      Comrade Axelrod has not only “forgotten” this, but
      generally would like, would he not, to have such
      “personalities” “consigned to oblivion”.
     

      To point out to the minority that for months on end they have
      been disrupting the Party, neglecting positive work, and taking up
      an immense amount of the energies of the Central Committee by
      their squabbling is to indulge in “personalities”, cast
      moral aspersions, and reduce a struggle between trends to the level of
      a squabble. There is no place in the columns of the Central Organ for
      that.
     

      But to accuse the Party Congress majority of having dared to waste
      time by pleading with the “mutineers”, of having disrupted
      the Party by their fight against (imaginary)
      disrupters—that is a difference of principle, for which the
      columns of Iskra should be “reserved”. Isn’t that
      your view, most esteemed Comrade Axelrod?
     

      It is possible that even today, if Comrade Axelrod looks around him,
      he will find plenty of examples of the minority’s practical workers,
      too, relegating “positive work” to the dim remoteness of
      an also desirable but still indefinite future.
     

      No, it would have been wiser for you not to say anything about the
      attitude of the majority and the minority to positive work! It would
      have been wiser not to bring up a subject about which, for instance, a
      factory worker in the town of——writes to me as follows:
     

      Dear Comrade,
     

      "We have been informed lately, that is, since the Second Party
      Congress, that the Central Committee was not elected by the Congress
      unanimously, that the Congress split in two over the relations between

    

      the Central Organ and the Central Committee, and that a
      so-called majority and minority arose. This came down on our
      heads as a terrible crushing blow, because this whole question
      of the relations between the Central Organ and the Central
      Committee was something absolutely new and unexpected for us:
      before the Congress it had never been raised,not only at any
      circles or meetings, but, as far as I can remember, in the
      literature either. This fact of nothing being said about it
      before the Congress is what I cannot understand. If we are to
      assume that the issue did not exist at all, then it has to be
      admitted that the comrades who worked so hard to unite the Party
      did not have a clear idea as to its organisation, that is, its
      structure. But that is quite out of the question, because the
      issue which has now split the Party shows clearly that opinions
      as to the Party structure did exist, and were not unanimous. But
      if that was so, why was the fact concealed? That is the first
      thing I want to say. The second is that when it comes to the
      question itself, I ask myself: what structure of the Party will
      ensure its trend being orthodox? And at once it strikes me that
      another important thing, besides the Party’s structure, is the
      personnel of its leadership ; that is, if the leaders are
      orthodox, then the Party trend will be orthodox, but if they are
      opportunists, then the Party will be opportunist too. Now, with
      that in mind, and knowing the personnel of the Party leader
      ship, I am definitely in favour of the Central Organ
      predominating over the Central Committee in the ideological
      direction of the Party. What makes me all the more positive
      about it is the conditions in Russia: however orthodox the
      Central Committee may be, since it functions in Russia it cannot
      be secure against arrests, and hence against losing its
      orthodoxy regardless of its own wishes, because successors don’t
      always resemble the people they succeed. Any comrade who has
      worked on the committees for any time at all will know of cases
      when even the best committee is replaced, through one of the
      many possible chance circumstances, by a bad committee, and vice
      versa. But with the Central Organ it’s quite another matter: it
      functions under different conditions (since it will be located
      abroad), which ensure it a longer existence, and hence an
      opportunity of preparing worthy successors. But I don’t know,
      comrade, if this question can be decided once and for all, that
      is, by having the Central Organ always predominate over the
      Central Committee, or the Central Committee over the Central
      Organ. I don’t think it is possible. Take a case like this:
      suppose the personnel of the Central Organ changes and from
      being orthodox becomes opportunist, as in the case of the

 Vorwärts[5]

 in Germany; could it be allowed
      to predominate in the ideological leadership? What would we who
      have been schooled in the orthodox spirit do if that happened,
      would we have to agree with it? No, it would be our duty to take
      away its right to predominate and give that right to a different
      body; and if that were not don  for any reason, whether a sense
      of Party discipline or’ anything else, we would all deserve to
      be called traitors to the Social-Democratic workers’ movement.
      That’s how I see it, and I can’t agree at all to a decision being made
      once and for all, as some comrades do.
     

      "Now, what I cannot understand at all is the fight that’s going
      on now between the majority and the minority, and to a great many of

    

      us it seems wrong. Look, comrade, is it a natural state of
      affairs when all energies are spent on travelling around the
      committees for the one purpose of talking about the majority and
      minority? Really, I don’t know. Is this issue really so
      important that all energies should be devoted to it and because
      of it people should look on each other practically as enemies?
      For that’s what it comes down to: if a committee is, let’s say,
      made up of followers of one camp, then nobody from the other
      camp will ever get into it, no matter how fit he may be for the
      work; in fact, he won’t get in even if he is essential to the
      work and it suffers badly without him. I don’t mean to say, of
      course, that the struggle over this issue should be given up
      altogether, no, only I think it should be of a different kind
      and should not lead us to forget our principal duty, which is to
      propagate Social-Democratic ideas among the masses; for if we
      forget that we shall rob our Party of its strength. I don’t know
      if it is fair or not, but when I see people trampling the
      interests of the work in the mud and completely forgetting them,
      I call them all political intriguers. It really hurts and fills
      you with alarm for the work when you see the people at the head
      of it spending their time on something else. When you see that,
      you ask yourself: is our Party doomed to perpetual splits over
      such trifles, are we incapable of waging the internal and the
      external struggle at the same time? What’s the use of having
      congresses if their decisions are ignored and everybody does
      just what he pleases, saying that the Congress decision is
      wrong, that the Central Committee is ineffectual, and so on. And
      this is being done by people who before the Congress were always
      clamouring for centralisation, Party discipline and so on, but
      who now want to show, it seems, that discipline is only meant
      for ordinary mortals, and not for them at the top. They seem to
      forget that their example has a terrible demoralising effect on
      inexperienced comrades; already we hear the workers complaining
      again that the intellectuals are forgetting them because of
      their own dissensions; already the more impulsive are drop ping
      their hands in despair, not knowing what to do. So far all
      this centralisation has turned out to be nothing but words. All
      one can hope is that the future will bring a change for the

 better.”[6]

By the way, I should like the editors to note that my pamphlet is
appearing with the “established imprint”. As a convinced central ist, I
obey the “principles” laid down by our Central Organ, which in its 55th
issue has instituted a section where Party publications are reviewed from
the standpoint of their “imprints” (as a contribution to the fight
against formalism).  —Lenin

      It was on November 13 (26), 1903, that Plekhanov co-opted the Mensheviks
      Martov, Axelrod, Zasulich, and Potresov to the editorial board of
      Iskra.

Vorwärts (Forward)—the daily Central Organ of the German
      Social-Democratic Party. Originally founded in 1876 in Leipzig, it was
      banned under the Anti-Socialist Law, but in January 1891 resumed publication
      in Berlin as successor to the Berliner Volks blatt (Berlin People’s
      Gazette, founded in 1884), under the editorship of Wilhelm
      Liebknecht. Engels fought in the columns of the Vorwärts against
      every manifestation of opportunism; but in the late nineties, after Engels’s
      death, the paper fell into the hands of the Right wing of the party and from
      then on regularly printed the writings of the opportunists who dominated in
      the German Social-Democratic movement and the Second International. The
      Vor wiirts gave a tendentious picture of the fight against
      opportunism and revisionism in the R.S.D.L.P., supporting the Economists and
      later, after the split in the Party, the Mensheviks. In the years of
      reaction that followed the defeat of the Russian Revolution of 1905-07 it
      published slanderous articles by Trotsky while denying Lenin and the
      Bolsheviks the opportunity to controvert him and give an objective account
      of the state of affairs in the Party.
     

      During the First World War the Vorwiirts took a social-chauvin ist
      stand. After the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia it became one
      of the fountain-heads of anti-Soviet propaganda. It ceased publication in
      1933.

      The author of this letter was the worker N. Y. Vilonov, a member of the
      Ekaterinoslav Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. Lenin replied to the letter on
      December 9 (22), 1903.

      A circle or a party? That is the question our Central Organ
      has posed for discussion.
     

      We consider discussion of this question to be exceed ingly
      timely. We invite the editorial board of our Central Organ to
      begin by taking a look at itself. What is this editorial board?
      Is it a circle of persons who have been together for so-and-so
      many years and who have now forced their way on to the editorial
      board by means of a boycott, disruptive activities and the
      threat of a split, or is it a body of officials of our Party?
     

      Do not try to evade the point by saying that you were co-opted
      legally, in accordance with the Rules. We do not question the
      legality of it; but we invite you not to con fine yourselves to
      the formal aspect, but to answer the sub stance of our
      question. We want, not merely a juridical, but a political
      answer. And we want that answer from you, gentlemen,
      “editors” who were never elected by the Congress,
      never appointed by the Party, and not from Comrade Plekhanov,
      who, perhaps, had no alternative but to co-opt you in order to
      avoid a split.
     

      Are you a circle or a body of Party officials?
     

      If you are a circle, then why this hypocrisy and sham, these
      phrases about a party? Have you not, in reality, disrupted that
      Party, mocking for weeks and months at its institutions and its
      Rules? Have you not, in reality, repudiated the decisions of
      the Second Congress of that Party, have you not brought matters
      to the point of a split, have you not refused to submit to the
      Central Committee and the Council? Have you not placed
      yourselves outside the Party

    

      by saying that for you Party congresses are not divine, i.e., not
      binding? You trample upon the institutions and laws of the Party and
      at the same time are pleased to use the imprint “Central Party
      Organ"!
     

      But if you are Party officials, would you mind explaining to the Party
      why, and in the name of what, persons who were not appointed by the
      Congress insisted on ensconcing themselves in a central Party
      institution? Perhaps in the name of the “continuity” of
      the old family circle of editors? To think that people who at the
      League Congress passed resolutions about this philistine
      “continuity” now want to bamboozle us with talk of the
      Party! Why, what right have you to talk of a party?
     

      You describe as formalists those who take their stand on the formal
      decisions of the Second Congress—because you must blur and gloss
      over the fact that you have betrayed the trust of your
      comrades,who, every one of them, pledged themselves over and over
      again to obey the decisions of the Congress. You do not submit to
      formal decisions when they are against you, but at the same time you
      unblushingly invoke the formal rights of the League when those rights
      are to your advantage, you invoke the formal decisions of the Party
      Council now that you have managed, against the Party’s will, to
      insinuate yourselves into this, the supreme Party institution.
     

      You describe as bureaucrats those who hold Party posts by the will of
      the Party Congress, not the caprice of an 6migr6 circle of
      writers. You have to do this to cover up the disagreeable fact that
      it is indeed a spirit of bureaucracy, a spirit of place-hunting that
      obsesses those who just could not bring themselves to work in the
      Party except as members of its central institutions. Yes, your
      behaviour has indeed clearly shown us that our Party suffers from a
      spirit of bureaucracy that puts office above work and shuns neither
      boycott nor disruption in the effort to get into office.
     

      You describe as grossly mechanical decisions passed by a majority vote
      at the Party Congress, but you do not consider grossly mechanical and
      scandalous the methods of struggle in the colonies abroad and at the
      League Congress which gained you your shameful victory over our Party
      editorial board! You do not see anything hypocritical in

    

      protestations of recognising the Party being made by people who have
      fought for and obtained control of the Central Party Organ although
      they were a minority at the Party Congress!
     

      And you call these hypocritical efforts to whitewash your indecent,
      anti-Party behaviour, this preaching of anarchy, this mockery of the
      Party Congress, this opportunist justifying of circle
      philistinism—you call this your new organisational standpoint!
     

      Comrades! Those who are serious in counting themselves members of the
      Party must raise an emphatic voice of pro test and put a stop to this
      shameful state of affairs! Those who are serious about
      Iskra’s three years of work and the Party Congress which it
      prepared, and which expressed the will of those Russian
      Social-Democrats who are really convinced on the basis of principle
      and are really working, will never allow an 6migr6 circle to trample
      underfoot all that this Party Congress achieved.
     

      Either—or.
 

      Either we have no party and are completely in the power of an 6migr6
      writers’ editorial circle that our Congress rejected—and in that
      case, away with this hypocritical talk of a party, away with the false
      imprints of “Party” publications, organs and institutions!
      We are not the Socialist-Revolutionaries, we have no need of painted
      scenery. The party of the proletariat demands the truth. The party of
      the proletariat demands the ruthlessly outspoken exposure of the
      obsolete circle spirit. We must have the courage to admit that there
      is no party and set to work from the beginning, from the very
      beginning, to create and build up a real party. We shall not be
      daunted by the temporary victory of the circle spirit, we believe and
      know that the class-conscious Russian proletariat will be able to
      build itself a party in fact, and not just in name, a party in the
      sense of genuine party institutions, not in the sense of false
      imprints.
     

      Or we do have a party—and in that case, away with all circle
      interests, away with gatherings of 6migr6 rowdies! In that case, let
      our Party editorial board be vacated at once by those not
      appointed to it by the Party Congress. In that case, let the editorial
      board of the Central Organ be

    

      restored as elected by the Congress. In that case, let
      our Party organ advocate the views of the Party
      majority, let our Party organ defend Party organisation
      and the Party institutions instead of trampling them in the mud.
     

      Down with the circle spirit, and, first of all, down with it on
      our Party editorial board!
     

      Down with disrupters!
     

      Long live the party of the proletariat, a party able to observe
      in practice the decisions of the Party Congress and to respect
      Party discipline and organisation!
     

      Down with hypocritical talk and false imprints!

[1]

      The Party Council session held in Geneva on January 15-17 (28-30), 1904, was
      “called on the initiative of the representatives of the Central Organ
      to discuss measures for harmonising the activities of the Central Committee
      and Central Organ in the publication of Party literature” (Lenin
      Miscellany X, p. 181). It was attended by Lenin, Leugnik, Plekhanov,
      Axelrod, and Martov.
     

      On Lenin’s proposal, the Council resolved to include in the agenda and
      discuss as the first item the question of measures to restore peace in the
      Party. On January 15 (28) Lenin, on behalf of the Central Committee, moved a
      resolution on this question (pp. 147-49 of this volume). When the debate
      showed that the Mensheviks would not agree to this resolution, Lenin and
      Lengnik proposed, on January 16 (29), another resolution on restoring peace
      in the Party, which the Council adopted by three votes (Lenin, Lengnik, and
      Plekhanov) to two (Martov and Axelrod). However, instead of then practically
      discussing what must be done to restore peace, the



      Council, over Lenin’s protest, proceeded to vote Plekhanov’s resolu
      tion,which demanded co-optation of Mensheviks to the Central Com mittee. By
      the votes of Plekhanov, Martov, and Axeirod, this resolu tion was
      passed. Thereupon the Central Committee representatives (Lenin and Leugnik)
      recorded on January 17(30) a dissenting opinion which censured Plekhanov’s
      resolution as ignoring the will of the majority of the Second Party
      Congress. The text of the dissenting opinion (pp. 150-53 of this volume) was
      drawn up by Lenin. 

      After the Mensheviks frustrated every effort to establish peace in the
      Party, Lenin moved a resolution on convening the Third Party Congress, as
      the only way out of the situation (p. 154 of this volume). By the votes of
      Plekhanov, Martov, and Axeirod this resolution was rejected and Martov’s
      resolution against a congress was passed. Concerning the publication of
      Party literature no agree ment was reached either. Rejecting the resolutions
      moved on this subject by Lenin (p. 155 of this volume), the Council adopted
      resolutions which endorsed the factional, disruptive activities of the
      Menshevik editorial board of Iskra. 

      The Council session of January 1904 made it plain that with Plekhanov’s
      defection to the Mensheviks the Council had become an instrument of the
      Mensheviks’ fight against the Party.

## Measures to Restore Peace in
    the Party






Lenin: 1904/council: Draft Resolution On Measures to Restore Peace In the Party, Moved On January 15 (28)







V. I.  

      Lenin
Session of the Council of the R.S.D.L.P. (January 1904)
January 15-17 (28-30), 1904


    
 
    1
Draft Resolution On Measures to Restore
      Peace In the Party, Moved On January 15 (28) 

      In view of the character and forms of manifestation of the
      divergence among the Party membership in connection with the
      Second Regular Congress, the Party Council deems it urgently
      necessary to call vigorously on all Party members to work
      together in harmony under the direction of both central
      institutions of the Party: the Central Organ and the Central
      Committee.
    

      The historical juncture through which Russia is now passing—the
      tremendous intensification of revolutionary ferment within the country
      and the international complications, which may lead to
      war—imposes particularly serious duties on the party of the
      class-conscious proletarians, who are fighting in the front ranks for
      the emancipation of the entire people from the yoke of the
      autocracy. The need to work together in harmony, under the direction
      of both the central bodies of the Party, at strengthening our
      organisation and developing the class-consciousness and
      solidarity of the
      widest possible masses of the working class has never been so urgent
      as it is now.
    

      Individual differences over all manner of questions have always arisen
      and inevitably will arise in a party which rests on a vast popular
      movement and sets out to be the conscious spokesman of that movement,
      emphatically rejecting all circle spirit and narrow sectarian
      views. But if our Party members are to be worthy representatives of
      the class conscious militant proletariat, worthy participants in the
      world working-class movement, they must do their

    

      utmost to ensure that no individual differences over the
      interpretation and methods of realising the principles of our
      Party programme shall interfere, or be capable of interfering,
      with harmonious joint work under the direction of our central
      institutions. The deeper and broader our under standing of our
      programme and of the tasks of the inter national proletariat,
      the more we value positive work in developing propaganda,
      agitation, and organisation, and the farther removed we are from
      sectarianism, the petty circle spirit, and considerations of
      place and position, the more must we strive to have differences
      among Party members discussed calmly and on their merits and not
      to let these differences interfere with our work, disrupt our
      activities, impede the proper functioning of our central
      institutions.
    

      The Party Council, as the supreme institution of the Party,
      vigorously condemns all disruptive moves, no matter on whose
      part, all refusals to work, all withdrawals of financial support
      for the central Party treasury, all boycotts, which are only
      calculated to lower a purely ideological struggle of opinions,
      views and shades to the level of methods of gross mechanical
      pressure, the level of an unseemly scuffle. The Party is worn
      out by the dissensions, which have already lasted nearly six
      months, and insistently demands peace. No differences among
      Party members, no dissatisfaction with the personal composition
      of one or other central body can justify boycotts or similar
      methods of struggle, which denote a lack of principles and
      ideals and show that the interests of the Party are being
      sacrificed to the interests of a circle, and the interests of
      the working- class movement to narrow considerations of place
      and position. Cases occur, of course, in our Party, as they
      always will in every big party, when some of the members are
      dissatisfied with some nuance in the activities of one or other
      of
      the central bodies, with some features of its line, or with its
      personal composition, etc. Such members can, and should, state
      the causes and nature of their dissatisfaction in a comradely
      exchange of opinions, or by a controversy in the columns of the
      Party press; but it would be absolutely impermissible and
      unworthy of revolutionaries to express their dissatisfaction by
      resorting to boycotts or refusing to support in every way they
      can all the positive work co-ordinated

    

      and directed by both the central Party bodies. To support
      both central bodies and work together under their direct guidance is
      our common and plain duty as Party members.
    

      Such unprincipled, grossly mechanical methods of struggle as
      have been mentioned above are deserving of unqualified
      condemnation, for they could completely wreck the whole Party,
      whose u iity depends solely and entirely on the free will of the
      revolutionaries. And the Party Council reminds all Party members
      that that free will was quite definitely expressed in our common
      decision—to which no protest was raised—to regard
      all the decisions of the Second Congress and all its elections
      as binding on all Party members. Already the Organising
      Committee in its time, which earned a general vote of thanks for
      its work in arranging the Congress, adopted in Point 18 of the
      Regulations for the Second Congress the following decision,
      which was approved by all the Party committees:
    

      "All decisions of the Congress and all the elections it carries
      out are decisions of the Party and binding on all Party
      organisations. They cannot be challenged by any one on any pretext
      whatever and can be rescinded or amended only by the next Party
      Congress."
    

      This decision, accepted by the entire Party before the Congress and
      reaffirmed several times at the Congress itself, was equivalent to a
      word of honour freely pledged by all Social-Democrats to each
      other. Let them not forget this word of honour! Let them at once
      abandon all petty mutual grievances! Let them once and for all confine
      the struggle of ideas within such bounds that it does not lead to
      breaches of the Rules or hamper practical activities and positive
      work!

## Dissenting Opinion









Lenin: 1904/council: Dissenting Opinion Recorded By the Representatives of the Central Committee, January 17 (30)

    2
Dissenting Opinion Recorded By the
      Representatives of the Central Committee,
      January 17 (30) 

      The representatives of the Central Committee in the Party Council
      consider it their duty to record a dissenting opinion on Comrade
      Plekhanov’s resolution.
    

      The representatives of the Central Committee are profoundly convinced
      that, far from putting an end to the Party dissensions, which actually
      mean a complete split in the Party organisation, this resolution will,
      on the contrary, inflame and aggravate them still further, make them
      chronic, and further disrupt the Party’s positive work.
    

      This resolution is, essentially, nothing but an expression of the
      wish of the Party Congress minority to alter the personal composition
      of the Central Committee, ignoring the contrary wish of the Party
      Congress majority.
    

      This resolution, as we are firmly convinced, is essentially a
      continuation within the Council of the policy pursued by the
      opposition ever since the Party Congress; and that policy has been one
      of boycott, disruption and anarchy, with the aim of altering the
      composition of the Party’s central bodies by methods which do not
      conform in any degree to the standards of normal Party life, and which
      have now been condemned, too, by revolutionary public opinion as
      expressed in resolutions by the majority of the committees.
    

      This resolution expresses the wish that the Central Committee should
      again enter into negotiations with the opposition. Negotiations have
      already been going on for over five months, causing complete
      demoralisation in the Party’s ranks. The Central Committee has already
      stated that it

    

      said its last word when it consented, as far back as November
      25,1903, to the co-optation of two in token of comradely confidence.
    

      The negotiations have already entailed a tremendous expenditure of
      funds for travelling and an even more serious expenditure of the time
      and energy of revolutionaries, who have been diverted from their work.
    

      The representatives of the Central Committee do not feel justified in
      again renewing these interminable negotiations, which produce fresh
      dissatisfaction on both sides and fresh contention over posts,
      hampering positive work in the most appalling way.
    

      We most earnestly draw attention to the fact that such negotiations
      involve a complete interruption of the normal course of Party life.
    

      We declare that the Central Committee lays the entire responsibility
      for these interruptions at the door of the minority.
    

      We declare that we positively and absolutely fail to see any other
      honest and proper solution to the present dissensions in the Party,
      any other way of terminating this unpardonable struggle over the
      composition of the central bodies, than by the immediate convening of
      a Party Congress.
    

      At the same time we feel that, now that Comrade Plekhanov’s
      resolution has been adopted, our own earlier resolution has in effect
      been nullified and has become quite pointless, for which reason we
      withdraw it.

## Restore Peace in the
    Party

      5
Speeches On Measures to Restore Peace In the Party,
January 15 (28)
      
5I

I have raised the question of measures to restore peace and
normal relations in the Party because the amount of
misunderstandings among Party workers has reached threatening
proportions. I do not think fruitful Party work is possible
unless there is some common basis which Party members who
become involved for any reason in mutual misunderstandings
could adhere to in their activities. It is nobody’s secret
that the relations between individual members and sections of
the Party have become so abnormal that it would be difficult
to speak now of a united Social- Democratic workers’
party and mean it. I could, of course, if necessary, furnish
detailed proof of this (recall, for in stance, many of the
episodes in the business correspondence between the Central
Committee and the Central Organ); but perhaps, since everybody
knows it to be so, it would be better not to resort just now
to such ticklish illustrations. And so, we must try to adopt
more vigorous measures to remove the basic evil. Otherwise we
shall have a position where the simplest, most routine Party
acts will give rise to highly undesirable exchanges with
systematic indulgence in very strong language and in the
choicest—how shall I put it miIdly? compliments shall we
say.... It may seem that I am disposed to encroach in some way
on “freedom of speech”; but after all, the
trouble is that in the sphere of action all is not well
either. As members of the Council, whose chief function is to
work for unity in the Party,

    

against tendencies towards disunity, we must make an effort to
remove the friction that is hindering the Party’s work; and
given the desire, this would not be impossible. And so, I ask
whether some sort of measures could not be adopted against
certain methods of struggle within the Party which reduce the
latter to the condition of a disorganised group and turn it
into a sheer fiction. Perhaps the Council could, in the
interests of the common work, pass a resolution which I have
drafted and will read to you in a moment. I consider it
important in principle to have a Council decision that would
aim at eliminating and condemning impermissible forms of
struggle between individuals or groups in the Party who are at
variance on any point. I repeat, the position now is much too
abnormal and needs to be corrected. (Axelrod:
“We all agree on that.") I ask the secretaries to enter
Comrade Axelrod’s remark in the minutes.
      

I shall now read the draft of the resolution I am

      submitting.[1]


That is the resolution which I am moving on behalf of the
Central Committee, over the signatures of both its
representatives, and which could serve, not to settle any
specific issues or differences between Party members, but to
create a common basis for Russian Social-Democrats, who are
working in the interests of one common cause.

## Restore Peace in the
    Party

      6
Speeches On Measures to Restore Peace In the Party,
January 15 (28)
      
6VI

      I think It necessary to reply mainly to the detailed objections
      advanced by Comrade Martov; but so as not to leave Comrade
      Plekhanov’s objections unanswered either, I shall first touch
      briefly on these. My impression was that he was in principle in
      favour of proportional representation.... (Plekhanov:
      “No!") Perhaps I misunderstood him, but that was my
      impression. In our Party organisation the principle of
      proportional representation is not practised, and the sole
      criterion of the lawfulness of the composition of any body whose
      members were elected at a congress is the clearly expressed will
      of the congress majority. But we are told here that the lawful
      elections at the Congress have produced a “lawful”
      state of affairs that is worse than an unlawful one. That is
      true, but why is it so? Is it because the majority was a slight
      one, or because the minority has in effect brought about a
      split? When people talk about the Central Committee having been
      elected by only twenty-four votes, that is, by a tiny margin,
      and claim that that is the reason for all the unhappy
      complications in Party life since, I declare that that is not
      so. As to Comrade Plekhanov’s remark about my “formalistic
      mentality” preventing me from going to the root of the
      matter, I must say I am at a loss to know what, properly
      speaking, this means. Perhaps the “root of the
      matter” lies in the Congress? In that case we are all
      formalists, for, casting our minds back to the Congress, we must
      go by its formal decisions. If, on

    

      the other hand, the “root of the matter” lies outside the
      Congress, just where does it lie? Yes, the way things have gone, the
      state of affairs in the Party is worse than unlawful (a very serious
      thing to say), but the whole question is, why has this happened? Is
      the Congress to blame, or what occurred after the Congress?
      Unfortunately, Comrade Plekhanov does not put the matter like that.
    

      I turn now to the remarks of Comrade Martov. He asserts that the
      minority does not and did not refuse to work together with
      us. That is not true. For three months—September, October
      and November—many representatives of the minority gave
      practical proof of not wanting to work together with us. In such
      cases the boycotted side only has one course open to it—to
      make an agreement, a deal with the “offended”
      opposition that refuses to work and is leading the Party towards
      a. split, for this very fact of refusing to work together is
      nothing but a split. When people tell you point- blank that they
      will not work with you, thus proving in practice that the
      “united organisation” is simply a fiction, that,
      actually, it has already been wrecked, they are certainly
      advancing a shattering, if not a convincing,
      argument.... I pass on to Comrade Martov’s second
      objection—concerning the resignation of Comrade

      Ru[1] from the
      Council. This question involves two
      separate issues. In the first place, was it in order for Ru to
      be appointed to the Council from the editorial board when he was
      not himself a member of the board? I think it was in
      order. (Martov: “Of course it was!") Please enter
      Martov’s interjection in the minutes. Secondly, are Council
      members subject to recall at the will of the bodies that
      delegated them? This is an intricate point, which can be
      interpreted both ways. In any case, the fact is that Plekhanov,
      who from November 1 onwards remained the sole member of
      the editorial board, did not recall Ru from the Council
      right up to November 26, when Martov and Co. were co-opted. Ru
      resigned of his own accord, it was a con cession on his part so
      that no controversy should start over him. (Plekhanov:
      “It seems to me that arguments about Comrade Ru are out of
      place here. The question is not on our agenda and I don’t see
      why we should waste precious time discussing what for us is an
      extraneous matter.") I must point out that at our last meeting
      Comrade Martov asked

    

      to have entered in the minutes his explanation on this point— an
      explanation with which I totally disagree—so that if the other
      side is not allowed to give its opinion on the subject too, the
      picture given here in the Council will be a one- sided, incorrect
      one. (Plekhanov: “I wish to emphasise that the question
      is not on the agenda and has no direct bearing on the main subject
      under discussion.")
    

Lenin, protesting against this formulation, appeals to the
      Council to decide as to his right to give his own account, as against
      Martov’s, of a fact meeting here with such divergent
      interpretations. (Plekhanov again indicates that discussion
      of the question of Ru is out of place.)
    

Lenin insists on his right to appeal to the Council for
      permission to speak on a point that has already been brought up in the
      Council and has aroused argument. (Mar toy: “Since
      Comrade Lenin has raised the very important question of the right of
      the bodies represented on the Council to recall their delegates, let
      me state that I shall table a special motion to have this question
      settled once and for all. Perhaps this statement will satisfy Lenin
      and induce him to drop this matter of Ru from the present
      discussion.")
    

      Comrade Martov has not only not disproved but has confirmed
      that I am right in my intention to present Comrade Ru’s
      resignation from the Council in its proper light here and
      now. Please note that my explanations on this point have only
      been in answer to Comrade Martov’s remarks concerning
      it. (Plekhanov informs Martov and Lenin that the
      question of Ru is not subject to present discussion, as not
      being among the problems on which the attention of the Council
      should at this session be centred.) I protest against Comrade
      Plekhanov’s statement that it is out of place to discuss the
      question of Comrade Ru, who held that Council members were not
      recallable; so that his resignation from the Council must be
      viewed as a concession made to the opposition in the interests
      of peace and good will. in the Party. (Plekhanov:
      “Since the Council apparently has nothing against an
      exchange of opinion on the subject of Comrade Ru, by all means
      let Lenin go on with it.") I have already
      finished. (Plekhanov: “If you have finished, I
      suggest that the Council should now discuss the resolutions
      moved yesterday by Comrade Lenin and myself.")
    
 

      I agree with Comrade Martov that the Council resolutions would have,
      not juridical, but moral significance. Comrade Plekhanov has suggested
      that it would be desirable if I were to join the editorial
      board. (Plekhanov: “I did not say that.") At any rate,
      those were your words as I noted them down: “The best thing
      would be if Lenin joined the editorial board and the Central Committee
      co-opted three." (Plekhanov: “Yes, I said that under
      certain conditions, in order to secure peace in the Party, Comrade
      Lenin might be included on the editorial board and minority
      representatives co opted to the Central Committee.")
    

      Answering the question put to me as to just what change the
      editorial board of the Central Organ would be considered
      desirable, it would be easy for me to cite the opinion of the
      “majority”, who have indicated the desirability of
      Comrades Axelrod, Zasulich, and Starover leaving the
      board. Further, I must point out that in the activities of the
      Central Committee there has not been a single case of anyone
      being barred from Party work. Similarly, I cannot leave without
      protest Comrade Martov’s statement that the Central Committee
      became an instrument of warfare of one side against the
      other. The Central Committee was appointed as an instrument for
      the performance of Party functions, not as an instrument of
      “warfare of one side against the other”. This
      assertion of Comrade Martov’s is completely contrary to the
      facts. No one can cite a single fact to show that the Central
      Committee started and waged “war” on the
      minority. On the contrary, it was the minority that, by its
      boycott, made war, which inevitably provoked resistance. Then,
      too, I protest against the assertion that the alleged lack of
      confidence in the Central Committee hinders peaceful positive
      work more than the lack of confidence in the Central Organ. As
      to the centre of the discord not lying abroad, but in Russia, as
      Comrade Martov insists is the case, I have to say that the Party
      documents will prove the reverse. Comrade Martov, referring to
      the document of November

      25,[2]

      said that the Central Committee
      had itself admitted in principle that its composition was
      one-sided, since it had agreed to co-opt two of the minority. I
      protest against this interpretation of that document, for I
      myself had a share in drawing it up. The Central Committee’s
      action had an entirely

    

      different significance. It was not because it acknowledged its
      composition to be one-sided that the Central Committee agreed to
      this co-optation of two, but because we saw what was virtually a
      complete split in the Party. Whether the picture we formed of
      the situation was right or not is another matter.... Rumours
      reached us that preparations were going on for publishing a new
      organ.... (Plekhanov: “If we are going to bring
      in rumours, we shall get nowhere." Axelrod: “I
      for my part have heard that preparations for publishing a new
      organ are going on now....") I appeal to the Council: since
      Comrade Martov has interpreted the Central Committee document
      in a certain way, I am obliged to present my own interpretation
      of it.... I do not understand why my remark has occasioned so
      much excitement. (Plekhanov: “It is not a matter
      of excitement but of references to rumours being out of place.")
      I may be told that my motives were not valid. Perhaps not. But I
      put on record in any case that they were of the nature I have
      just indicated.
    

      To resume: Comrade Martov has impugned the Central Committee’s
      motives in agreeing to the co-optation of two. But I declare
      that the Central Committee was actuated by the conviction that
      a virtual split already existed in the Party and that we were on
      the eve of a complete formal split, in the sense of the
      publication of a separate organ, separate transport arrangements
      and a separate organisation in Russia. Now on a point of
      procedure: Comrade Martov’s remark had to do with the substance
      of the question, not with procedure. And I want to ask the
      Council: was the chair man right in acting as he did in this
      case?

Speeches On Convening the Third Party Congress,

7I

On the question of convening a congress there is little to
add. The Council debates too serve to illustrate the terribly
difficult position in the Party. The point has repeatedly been
made that two nearly equal halves formed at the Congress, so
that when one member of the “majority” dropped
out, complete equality resulted. I do not see how this
equality could lead to peace without a Party congress. No one
doubts that the discord is giving rise to crying
abnormalities. A belligerent frame of mind exists on both
sides; that is an indubitable fact. In the light of all
this, no other honest and proper solution than convening a
congress appears possible. Comrade Martov has spoken of the
technical, financial, and other such difficulties of carrying
out my proposal for a congress, but the present state of
things is worse by far than all these difficulties.

## Publication of Party Literature









Lenin: 1904/council: 8I







V. I.  

      Lenin
Session of the Council of the R.S.D.L.P. (January 1904)
January 15-17 (28-30), 1904



    

      8
Speeches On the Publication of Party Literature,
January 17 (30)
      
8I

I shall begin from the end. Comrade Martov has misunderstood
the Central Committee’s letters, particularly on the subject
of funds, and given a wrong interpretation of them. He leaves
out of account that these letters were a sequel to a
conversation which he, Martov, had with Travinsky. Martov
himself wrote about the purport of that conversation in these
terms: “To Comrade Travinsky, as to yourself, I
mentioned 5,000-6,000 as the expected minimum of what could
over a year be obtained for the Party from
the two sources to which the members of the editorial board
have access."  I must state that Travinsky spoke of this being
made available as a lump sum, not over the course of a year,
so that there is some misunderstanding. The fact is that we
counted on these 5,000 and apportioned funds between the
Russian and the foreign treasury accordingly.
      

Comrade Martov said that both the financial sources
(incidentally, how greatly the editorial board in its
irritation misrepresents the matter is evident from the fact
that
in letters to the Central Committee Martov actually used the
word “moneybags” in quotation marks and blamed us
for this expression, when in reality it was his own
expression, not ours)—I repeat, Comrade Martov said that
both the financial sources were known to us. Yes, they are
known, but the point is not whether they are known, but
whether they are accessible. I know that one of these sources
could provide up to

    

10,000 a year, the other up to 40,000, but that does not
help, for to me they are inaccessible. And it is their
conversion from accessible into inaccessible sources that
constitutes the cutting off of funds, which is an absolutely
impermissible method of waging the struggle in the Party.
      

There is also the fact of the recent arrests, involving people
who were due to obtain money in Russia. We have no money here,
getting any from Russia will be a long business, and it will
cost hundreds of rubles for the dispatch of special
messengers. Some money will be coming through eventually, of
course, barring further mishaps, but not soon, nor, in all
likelihood, really enough.
      

That there were threats in the Central Committee’s letter is
quite untrue. There was no question of any threatening, for
what the Central Committee was concerned for all along was the
publication of the Central Organ. The point about addresses
Comrade Vasilyev will deal with. According to our information,
the editorial board is sending agents of its own to
Russia. This implies a separate Central Organ treasury, which
means a de facto split in the Party. It is contrary
to the Rules, which require that the Central Committee should
be kept fully informed and that all funds and all
organisation of practical activities should be wholly
concentrated in its hands. The Central Organ is grossly
violating the Rules by setting up its own centre of travelling
agents, its own centre of practical leadership and
intervention in the affairs of the committees. The existence
of these agents, contrary to the Party Rules, introduces
direct disorganisation into the work. The Central Committee
cannot and will not be answerable for order in the conduct of
affairs when disorder is systematically introduced by the
Central Organ itself. Here are letters from Odessa and Baku
which illustrate how the matter stands. The Odessa letter, of
December 24, says:

"We had a visit yesterday from

      Zagorsky,[1]  who
      announced that he
had been delegated by the editorial board to inform the committees of
the latest developments, the negotiations, the present position in the
editorial board and the editors’ request to send in material and
contributions and to commission leaflets or suggest topics for
leaflets of general interest, and also for pamphlets, to issue which a
special group has been set up. He repeated all the old stuff and

    

worked hard to prove the minority right, nobleminded and
’loyal’. The committee heard him out, then asked some
questions, one of them being whether the Central Committee was
informed of his mission; whereupon, instead of giving a
straight yes or no, he proceeded to exonerate himself and
prove that the editorial board had every right to approach the
committees without the Central Committee’s knowledge. He
insisted that his communication should be discussed and a
resolution drawn up there and then, in his presence; to which
the committee replied that it took note of the communication,
but that as to discussing it and passing a resolution, it
would do that when it saw fit, while now it was going on to
its regular

      business."[2] And here is what we read
in a letter of January 1 from Baku: “The Baku
Committee. has received a visit from

      Martyn,[3]  who came with
a com  munication from the Central Organ and with the
undisguised object of sowing distrust in the Central
Committee. When, at the end of his statement, he inquired as
to the committee’s opinion, the answer he got was: The
Central Committee has our implicit confidence. And when he
retorted that he would like to know their attitude to the
Central Organ, he was told without any mincing of words that
after what they had just heard (the statement of his mission)
confidence in the latter ’had been

      shaken’."[4]


Equally improper and against the rules of secrecy is it that
the Central Organ gives information on the composition of the
Central Committee not only to the committees, but to private
individuals (as for instance to Druyan, as the Central
Committee pointed out in a letter to the Central Organ). As to
“waging war”, the fact is that Comrade Martov here
confuses two totally different things. In the sphere of
positive work and procuring funds any warfare (boycotts and
the like) is most certainly impermissible, and the Central
Committee has never engaged in any such thing. In the sphere
of literature, however, “war   is permissible, and no
one has ever restricted the Central Organ’s polemics. You
vill recall that even at a much earlier period the Central
Committee expressed complete readiness to publish both Dan’s
letter on the slogans of the opposition and Martov’s pamphlet
Once More in the Minority, though both contain
attacks upon itself.
      
 

The Central Committee has never once caused any delay in
issuing the Central Organ’s publications. Nor has there been a
single case of the Central Committee improperly or unfairly
distributing literature, of its “discriminating”
against the minority committees. On the contrary, Travinsky
has here testified and proved that the minority committees
were first of all generously supplied; Comrade Martov has had
to admit that in this respect the Central Committee’s
activities are above reproach. As to refusing people Party
literature, the matter stands as follows. Every Party
member without exception (if he inspires confidence as regards
secrecy precautions, etc.) is given literature free
to transport to Russia and there hand over to the Central
Committee agents for distribution. But when people have the
hardihood to call themselves members of the Party and at the
same time refuse to hand over literature to the Central
Committee agents for general distribution, then naturally the
Central Committee cannot (and has not even the right to) deal
with such individuals. And if these people afterwards buy up
literature for their separate parochial enterprises which
disorganise the common work, so much the worse for them.

      Comrades! That our Party is going through a severe crisis is known by
      now to all, and has in fact been directly and openly stated in our
      Central Organ also.
     

      We consider it our duty to call on all members of the Party to take a
      conscious and active part in putting an end to the crisis as speedily
      and painlessly as possible.
     

      Comrade Plekhanov, who at the Party Congress and— long
      after it—at the Congress of the League Abroad belonged to
      the Party Congress majority, now comes forward in No. 57 of
      Iskra as a champion of the demands of the minority,
      accusing the Central Committee of “eccentricity”, of
      an intransigence that only benefits our enemies, of refusing to
      co-opt minority adherents. Such co-optation is, in Comrade
      Plekhanov’s eyes, nothing less than “the only way to
      deliver our Party from its state of severe crisis, which sorely
      weakens our positions and strengthens those of our numerous
      enemies and opponents”. One must be guided not only by the
      Rules, says Comrade Plekhanov—in reference presumably to
      this state of severe crisis—but also by the actual
      position of affairs, by the existing relation of forces in the
      Party. One must rise above the circle and doctrinaire standpoint
      which pushes to the forefront what divides the workers instead
      of what unites them.
     

      These general principles are undoubtedly correct, and it only remains
      for every Social-Democrat to acquaint himself precisely with the facts
      and reflect seriously on the position in order correctly to apply
      them.
     

      Yes, we must without fail, at the cost of any and every effort,
      undaunted by the prospect of a long and arduous job, cure our Party of
      the circle spirit, of faction and schism

    

      over trifles, of unseemly and unworthy wrangling over the conductor’s
      baton! Take a good look, then, at the events that have developed in
      our Party since its Second Congress. Have the courage to expose our
      sores, in order to diagnose them without hypocrisy or official humbug
      and to apply the right treatment.
     

      The minutes of the Second Congress have now been published in their
      entirety; the minutes of the Congress of the League Abroad have
      likewise been made available to the Party membership. Party literature
      has already laid bare many manifestations and symptoms of our crisis,
      and although much still remains to be done in that respect, a certain
      summing up already can and should be made.
     

      The Second Congress ended with a bitter struggle over the
      composition of our central bodies. By a majority of 24 to 20, a
      Central Organ editorial board of three was elected (Plekhanov,
      Martov and Lenin), and a Central Committee likewise made up of
      three comrades. Martov refused to fill the post he had been
      elected to, and he and all of the minority refused to take part
      in the elections to the Central Committee. From the very time of
      the Congress the minority started a bitter fight against the
      central bodies, a regular war over the conductor’s baton, a
      regular war of the circle spirit against the party spirit, a war
      to get the old editorial board reinstated and a due (in the view
      of the minority) number of their adherents co-opted to the
      Central Committee. This war went on for months, and was
      accompanied by the minority’s total withdrawal from work under
      the direction of the central bodies, by a boycott of them, and
      by purely anarchistic preachings, specimens of which the Party
      membership will find in profusion in the minutes of the League
      Congress. The struggle chiefly centred abroad, among the section
      furthest removed from positive work and from the participation
      of class-conscious proletarians. It involved the central bodies
      set up by the Second Congress in an appalling waste of energy on
      trips, meetings, and negotiations intended to obviate countless
      petty dissatisfactions, disputes and squabbles. That the
      demands of the opposition utterly disregarded the relation of
      forces whether at the Second Congress or in the Party as a whole
      may be seen, for example, from the fact that while the editors
      of the Central

    

      Organ (Plekhanov and Lenin) actually agreed to the co-optation
      of two—that is, to equal representation of the Party
      Congress majority and minority—the opposition demanded a
      huge majority (four to two) on the editorial board. Under the
      threat of an inevitable and immediate split, the two central
      bodies finally made a number of concessions to the demands
      regarding the conductor’s baton: the editors were co opted,
      Lenin resigned from the editorial board and the Council,
      another majority member resigned from the Council likewise, the
      reorganisation of the League Abroad, whose Congress had flouted
      everything the Party Congress had decided, was allowed to lapse,
      and the opposition was offered two seats on the Central
      Committee.
     

      The opposition rejected this offer. It evidently demands a larger
      number of seats, and for persons who would not be chosen by the
      Central Committee, but named by the opposition. Neither the relation
      of forces nor the interests of the work furnish the slightest
      justification for such demands:
      all that these ultimatums are backed by is threats of a split and acts
      of grossly mechanical pressure, such as boycotts and withholding of
      funds.
     

      The Party has been disorganised and demoralised to the utmost by this
      fight for posts, which diverts its forces from positive work. This
      demoralisation is not lessened but, if anything, heightened by the
      fact that the minority’s so- called differences of principle lend this
      fight a false colouring.
     

      We all agreed unanimously—and said so emphatically time
      and again—to recognise all decisions of the Second
      Congress and all its elections as unconditionally binding. Now
      the minority has in practice repudiated the entire Rules and all
      the elections; now those who uphold the common decisions are
      found to be “formalists"—those who received their
      powers from the Congress are labelled “bureaucrats"—
      those who take their stand by the vote of the majority, which
      (by our common consent) expressed the relation of forces in the
      Party, are accused of a grossly mechanical and bureaucratic
      point of view. Those who at the Congress, having been charged by
      the membership with the duty of electing the Party’s officials,
      transferred some editors to the status of contributors and some
      members of the Organising

    

      Committee to that of ordinary Party workers, are now found guilty of
      converting Party members into cogs and wheels, etc., etc. The unsound
      and unstable position the minority already adopted at the Party
      Congress led inevitably to this dishonesty, which we are far from
      attributing to anyone’s subjective will.
     

      Is it not time to put an end to this strife and faction? Let everyone
      who cares about our Party’s future ask himself that.
     

      Is it not time to make a determined end of this fight for
      control of the central bodies, of this contention over posts,
      which is having such a disruptive effect on all our work? Is it
      fitting to embark yet again, after months and months of
      negotiations, upon new negotiations with the opposition, or to
      raise the question of the Central Committee’s being one-sided or
      eccentric? For the raising of that question, after the
      co-optation of the editors had already seemed to ensure peace,
      inevitably calls up again the question of the one-sidedness and
      eccentricity—the anti-Party nature,even— of our
      Central Organ. How long are we going to engage in this indecent
      wrangling over the composition of the central bodies? And how
      can we settle the issue as to which side is right in its
      demands? By what yardstick are we to measure it? Why is it the
      “firm-liners” that are to be counted intransigent,
      when they have ceded a very great deal of what the Congress
      decided, and not the “soft-liners”, who in practice
      have turned out uncommonly firm in their drive for a split and
      direct preparation of a split?
     

      Let the comrades consider how this abnormal position can be
      ended. The Central Committee had hoped that the change of
      cabinet at the Central Organ would bring peace. When the dispute
      had already gone very far, when the fight over the conductor’s
      baton had brought us to the very verge of a split—just one
      hope still remained: the achievement of some sort of
      disengagement, so as not to interfere with each other, so as
      gradually, in the process of working within one Party, to reduce
      the friction, so as not to touch, or to touch more seldom, on
      “sore” points. The division of the central bodies,
      one would have thought, at least partially ensured the ending of
      the crisis: the minority had the Central Organ to itself and
      could freely group around it, freely advocate

    

      its views, freely carry on its Party work, without feeling
      “alien” in the Party. And with the majority also
      controlling one of the central bodies—the Central Committee (or
      out numbering the minority upon it)—the majority too could feel
      at least some satisfaction. The fight over the central bodies could
      have ended and given place to a purely ideological clearing up of
      disagreements and shades of opinion.
     

      This hope is shattered by Iskra’s raising the question of
      co-optation to the Central Committee. We do not deem it possible to
      engage anew in this bargaining over posts, which fills us with
      repugnance. We should actually prefer, failing any other solution, to
      hand over all the conductor’s batons to the minority, if it
      positively cannot bring itself to work in the Party except in the top
      posts. Our readiness to do so increases as this ugly new malady of our
      movement drags on—as these petty squabbles, the more unbearable
      for being petty, become chronic.
     

      But we should first wish to know with all possible certainty the
      opinion of the Party, to consult revolutionary public opinion,
      especially within Russia. We invite comrades closely to examine and
      study the facts relating to our “crisis”, to make a
      thorough appraisal of the present position in the Party, and to state
      their views on all the questions raised.

      Geneva, February 20, 1904
     

      Dear Comrades,
     

      As your pamphlet touches on the circumstances which induced me to
      resign from the Iskra editorial board, I would request you to
      find space in the Appendix for this reply of mine to Comrade
      Plekhanov’s letter of January 29, 1904, to Comrade Martov, published
      in Martov’s pamphlet on combating the “state of siege”.
     

      Comrade Plekhanov finds that the statement of the case in my letter to
      the editors is inaccurate. However, he has not made, nor
      could he have made, a single correction of fact. He has
      merely supplemented my account with an inaccurate version of
      private conversations I had with him.
     

      Generally speaking, to quote private conversations is, I consider, a
      sure sign that serious arguments are lacking. I still hold the opinion
      so recently held by Comrade Plekhanov in reference to Comrade
      Martov’s accounts of private conversations (League Minutes, p. 134),
      namely, that it is scarcely possible for such conversations to be
      “reproduced accurately”, and that
      “controversy” regarding them “leads
      nowhere”.
     

      But since Comrade Plekhanov does cite our private conversations, I
      consider myself entitled to explain them and amplify, particularly as
      these conversations took place in the presence of third persons.
     

      The first conversation, in which Comrade Plekhanov said that he had

       decided[1]

to
      resign if I absolutely refused to

    

      agree to co-optation, took place on the evening of the day the
      League Congress ended and the following morning, in the presence
      of two members of the Party Council. The conversation revolved
      around concessions to the opposition. Plekhanov insisted that
      concessions were essential, for he felt certain that the
      opposition would not obey any decision of the Party Council and
      that a complete split of the Party might take place at any
      moment. I insisted that, after what had happened at the League,
      after the measures taken at its Congress by the representative
      of the Central Committee (each of which Comrade Plekhanov had
      taken part in discussing and had fully approved), it was
      impossible to yield to anarchistic individualism, and that the
      formation of a separate writers’ group (which I had repeatedly
      declared in conversation with Plekhanov, and contrary to his own
      opinion, to be quite permissible) need not necessarily imply a
      split. When the upshot of the conversation was that one of us
      would have to resign, I at once said that I would do so, not
      wishing to hamper Plekhanov in his attempts to settle the
      conflict and avoid what he considered would be a split.
     

      Comrade Plekhanov is so amiable towards me now as to find no other
      motive for my action than the most cowardly evasiveness. In order to
      paint this characteristic of mine in the liveliest colours, Comrade
      Plekhanov quotes me as saying: “Everybody will say that Lenin
      must be wrong if even Plekhanov disagrees with him."
     

      That is laying the colours on thick, no doubt about it! So thick, in
      fact, that, all unnoticed by Comrade Plekhanov, the result is a patent
      absurdity. If I had been convinced that “everybody” would
      consider Plekhanov right (as he modestly thinks to himself), and had
      thought it necessary to reckon with the opinion of this everybody,
      then, obviously, I would never have ventured to disagree with
      Plekhanov, I would have followed him in this instance too. In his
      desire to present my conduct in the most unprepossessing light and
      ascribe it to the most ignominious motives, he fathers on me

    

      a motive devoid of all sense. I am supposed to have been so
      afraid of disagreeing with Plekhanov in anything that— I did
      disagree with him. It doesn’t hold water, this argument
      of Comrade Plekhanov’s.
     

      Actually, my idea was that it would be better for me to resign, for
      otherwise my dissenting opinion would hamper Plekhanov’s
      attempts to secure peace. I did not want to ham per those
      attempts—perhaps we might in fact agree on peace terms—but
      I considered it impossible to assume responsibility for an editorial
      board on which an 6migr  circle imposed candidates in this
      way.
     

      A few days later I did go with a certain Council member to see
      Plekhanov, and our talk took the following course:
     

      "You know," said Plekhanov, “there are some wives who are
      so quarrelsome that it’s best to give way to them in order to avoid
      hysterics and an unsavoury row in public."
     

      “Perhaps so," I replied, “but in giving way you
      must take care to leave yourself strong enough to prevent an even
      bigger ’row’."
     

      "Well, but by resigning you surrender everything," said
      Plekhanov.
     

      "Not always," I rejoined, and cited the case of Chamberlain. My
      idea was one I have also expressed in print:
      should Plekhanov succeed in securing a peace acceptable to the
      majority, in whose ranks he had fought so long and so vigorously, then
      I would not start war either; if he should not succeed, I reserved to
      myself freedom of action, so as to denounce the “quarrelsome
      wife” if even Plekhanov could not calm and pacify her.
     

      It was during this conversation that I told Plekhanov (who did not yet
      know the opposition’s terms) of my “decision” to join the
      Central Committee (I could “decide” to do so, but of
      course all the members of the Central Committee would have to give
      their consent). Plekhanov was entirely sympathetic to this plan, as a
      last attempt to find some sort of mode of living with the
      “quarrelsome wife”. When, in a letter to Plekhanov on
      November 6, 1903, I expressed the opinion that perhaps he was simply
      going to hand over the editorial board to the Martovites, he replied
      (on November 8):
      "...You seem to have a wrong idea of my intentions. I explained them
      again yesterday to Comrade Vasilyev” (the

    

      Central Committee member who had attended the League
      Congress). Writing to this same Comrade Vasilyev on November 10 about
      whether to expedite or delay the 52nd issue of Iskra,
      containing a statement about the Congress, Plekhanov said:
      "... Publishing anything about the Congress means either 1)
      announcing that Martov and the others are not taking part in
      Iskra, or 2) refusln  this request of Mar- toy’s—in
      which case he will announce it himself in a special leaflet. In either
      case it would bring the split to the knowledge of the public, and
that is exactly what we have to avoid just now” (my
      italics—N. L.). On November 17, Plekhanov wrote to the
      same comrade: "... What would you say to the immediate
      co-optation of Martov and the others? I am beginning to think that
      this would be the way to settle the matter with the least
      difficulty. I do not want to act without you..." (Plekhanov’s
      italics).
     

      These quotations show clearly that Plekhanov was trying to act
      in agreement with the majority, and wanted to co-opt the editors
      solely for the sake of peace and on the condition of peace, and
      not for the purpose of war against the majority. If it has
      worked out the other way, that only goes to show that the cart
      of anarchistic individualism bad got rolling too recklessly in
      the tactics of boycott and disruption; the strongest brakes
      could not hold it back. That is a great pity, of course, and
      Plekhanov, who sincerely wanted peace, has landed in an
      unpleasant position; but that is no reason for putting all the
      blame on me.
     

      As to Plekhanov’s statement that I was willing to keep quiet in return
      for a suitable “equivalent”, and his proud declaration,
      “I did not see fit to purchase his silence”, this
      polemical trick only makes a comical impression when compared with
      the words I have just quoted from his letter of November 10. It was
      Plekhanov who attached the utmost importance to silence, to keeping
      the split from the knowledge of the

       public.[2]

      What more natural
      than that I should

    

      tell him I agreed to that too, provided there was peace? This talk
      about “equivalents” and “purchases” leads one
      to expect that next time Plekhanov will inform the public that Lenin
      is forging currency for transactions of this kind. That sort of thing
      has happened, after all, in our 6migr6 quarrels—and the present
      atmosphere is conducive to it.
     

      Comrade Plekhanov’s letter involuntarily leads one to wonder
      whether he is not now having to purchase the right to
      be in the minority. The tactics of the minority in our so-
      called Party organ are already quite clear. What they are trying
      to do is obscure the controversial issues and the facts which
      really led to our divergence. They are trying to show that
      Martynov was far closer to Iskra than Lenin— just
      how, where and to what extent the muddled editors of the new
      Iskra will be a long time endeavouring to explain. They
      hypocritically condemn dragging personalities into the
      controversy, while actually their whole struggle is one big
      campaign against an individual, in which they do not even
      hesitate to ascribe to the “enemy” pernicious
      qualities of the most incompatible kind—from the crassest
      pig-headedness to the most cowardly evasiveness. Anything to
      make it good and strong. And those new allies, Comrades
      Plekhanov and Martov, make it so good and strong that they will
      soon be no whit behind the famous Bundists with their famous
      epithet—"scum”. They are bombarding me so fiercely
      from their battleships that I am beginning to wonder whether
      this is not a conspiracy of two-thirds of the dreadful
      trio. Ought I not to pose as injured too? Ought I not to cry out
      about a “state of siege"? That is sometimes so convenient
      and so useful, you know....
     

      To be sure, to become a true minority man Comrade Plekhanov has
      still, I would say, to take two little steps: first, to avow
      that the formulation of Paragraph I of the Rules advocated by
      Comrades Martov and Axelrod at the Congress (and so zealously
      hushed up by them now) constitutes, not a step towards
      opportunism, not a surrender to bourgeois individualism, but
      the germ of new, truly Social-Democratic, Akimov-Martov and
      Martynov-Axelrod organisational views; and, secondly, to avow
      that the struggle with the minority since the Congress has not
      been a struggle against gross violations of Party discipline,
      against methods of

    

      agitation that only arouse disgust, not a struggle against anarchism
      and anarchistic phraseology (see pp. 17, 96, 97, 98, 101, 102, 104,
      etc., etc., of the League Minutes), but a struggle against a
      “state of siege”, bureaucracy, formalism, and so forth.
     

      I shall deal at length with controversial issues of this kind in a
      pamphlet I am now preparing for the press. Meanwhile
      ... meanwhile let us scan the gallery of Gogol types opened in the columns
      of our leading organ, which is making a practice of presenting its
      readers with conundrums. Who resembles a stiff-necked Sobakevich
      treading on everybody’s vanity—I beg pardon, their corns? Who is
      like an evasive Chichikov purchasing silence as well as dead souls?
      Who are like Nozdrev and Khlestakov, Manilov and Skvoznik

 Dmukbanovsky?[3]
      Interesting and edifying puzzles....
      "A controversy over principles...."
     
N. Lenin

 
Notes
 

[1]

In his zeal for accuracy, Comrade Plekhanov overdoes it a little when
he says: Plekhanov had no right to decide on co-optation, for

   

according to the Rules co-optation has to be unanimous. This is not a
correction, but a quibble, for what the Rules forbid in the absence of
unanimity is definite organisational actions, and not
decisions—which some people are all too prone to adopt for
appearances’ sake, without following them up with action.  —Lenin

[2]

A propos, it was Plekhanov who was so insistent about with
holding publication of the League Minutes and the concluding part
of the Party Congress Minutes—the part where he says that he takes upon
himself full moral responsibility for a direct vote against the old
so-called editorial board, and expresses the hope that the Party has not
grown poor in literary forces—a statement which one member of the
minority called a pompous phrase in pseudo-classical style.  —Lenin

      Comrade workers! May Day is coming, the day when the workers of all
      lands celebrate Their awakening to a class- conscious life, their
      solidarity in the struggle against all coercion and oppression of man
      by man, the struggle to free the toiling millions from hunger,
      poverty, and humiliation. Two worlds stand facing each other in this
      great struggle:
      the world of capital and the world of labour, the world of
      exploitation and slavery and the world of brotherhood and freedom.
     

      On one side stand the handful of rich blood-suckers. They have seized
      the factories and mills, the tools and machinery, have turned millions
      of acres of land and mountains of money into their private
      property. They have made the government and the army their servants,
      faithful watchdogs of the wealth they have amassed.
     

      On the other side stand the millions of the disinherited. They are
      forced to beg the moneybags for permission to work for them. By their
      labour they create all wealth; yet all their lives long they have to
      struggle for a crust of bread, beg for work as for charity, sap their
      strength and health by back-breaking toil, and starve in hovels in the
      villages or in the cellars and garrets of the big cities.
     

      But now these disinherited toilers have declared war on the moneybags
      and exploiters. The workers of all lands are fighting to free labour
      from wage slavery, from poverty and want. They are fighting for a
      system of society where the wealth created by the common labour will
      go to benefit, not a handful of rich men, but all those who work. They
      want to make the land and the factories, mills, and machines

    

      the common property of all toilers. They want to do away with the
      division into rich and poor, want the fruits of labour to go to the
      labourers themselves, and all the achievements of the human mind, all
      improvements in ways of working, to improve the lot of the man who
      works, and not serve as a means of oppressing him.
     

      The great struggle of labour against capital has cost the workers of
      all countries immense sacrifices. They have shed rivers of blood in
      behalf of their right to a better life and real freedom. Those who
      fight for the workers’ cause are subjected by the governments to
      untold persecution. But in spite of all persecution the solidarity of
      the workers of the world is growing and gaining in strength. The
      workers are uniting more and more closely in socialist parties, the
      supporters of those parties are mounting into millions and are
      advancing steadily, step by step, towards complete victory over the
      class of capitalist exploiters.
     

      The Russian proletariat, too, has awakened to a new life. It too
      has joined this great struggle. Gone are the days when our
      worker slaved submissively, seeing no escape from his state of
      bondage, no glimmer of light in his bitter life. Socialism has
      shown him the way out, and thousands upon thousands of fighters
      have thronged to the red banner, as to a guiding star. Strikes
      have shown the workers the power of unity, have taught them to
      fight back, have shown how formidable to capital organised
      labour can be. The workers have seen that it is off their labour
      that the capitalists and the government live and get fat. The
      workers have been fired with the spirit of united struggle, with
      the aspiration for freedom and for socialism. The workers have
      realised what a dark and evil force tbe tsarist autocracy
      is. The work ers need freedom for their struggle, but the
      tsarist govern ment binds them hand and foot. The workers need
      freedom of assembly, freedom to organise, freedom for newspapers
      and books, but the tsarist government crushes, with knout,
      prison and bayonet, every striving for freedom. The cry
      “Down with the autocracy!” has swept through the length
      and breadth of Russia, it has been sounded more and more often
      in the streets, at great mass meetings of the workers. Last
      summer tens of thousands of workers throughout the South of
      Russia rose up to fight for a better life, for freedom

    

      from police tyranny. The bourgeoisie and government trem bled at the
      sight of the formidable army of workers, which at one stroke brought
      to a standstill the entire industrial life of huge cities. Dozens of
      fighters for the workers’ cause fell beneath the bullets of the troops
      that tsarism sent against the internal enemy.
     

      But there is no force that can vanquish this internal enemy, for the
      ruling classes and the government only live by its labour. There is no
      force on earth that could break the millions of workers, who are
      growing more and more class- conscious, more and more united and
      organised. Every defeat the workers sustain brings new fighters into
      the ranks, it awakens broader masses to new life and makes them
      prepare for fresh struggles.
     

      And the events Russia is now passing through are such that this
      awakening of the worker masses is bound to be even more rapid
      and widespread, and we must strain every nerve to unite the
      ranks of the proletariat and prepare it for even more determined
      struggle. The war is making even the most backward sections of
      the proletariat take an interest in polit ical affairs and
      problems. The war is showing up ever more clearly and vividly
      the utter rottenness of the autocratic order, the utter
      criminality of the police and court gang that is ruling
      Russia. Our people are perishing from want and starvation at
      home—yet they have been dragged into a ruinous and
      senseless war for alien territories lying thou sands of miles
      away and inhabited by foreign races. Our people are ground down
      in political slavery—yet they have been dragged into a war
      for the enslavement of other peoples. Our people demand a change
      of political order at home— but it is sought to divert
      their attention by the thunder of guns at the other end of the
      world. But the tsarist govern ment has gone too far in its
      gamble, in its criminal squan dering of the nation’s wealth and
      young manhood, sent to die on the shores of the Pacific. Every
      war puts a strain on the people, and the difficult war against
      cultured and free Japan is a frightful strain upon Russia. And
      this strain comes at a time when the structure of police
      despotism has already begun to totter under the blows of the
      awakening proletariat. The war is laying bare all the weak spots
      of the government, the war is tearing off all false disguises,
      the

    

      war is revealing all the inner rottenness; the war is making the
      preposterousness of the tsarist autocracy obvious to all and is
      showing everyone the death-agony of the old Russia, the Russia where
      the people are disfranchised, ignorant and cowed, the Russia that is
      still in serf bondage to the police government.
     

      The old Russia is dying. A free Russia is coming to take its
      place. The dark forces that guarded the tsarist autocracy are
      going under. But only the class-conscious and organised
      proletariat can deal them their death-blow. Only the class-
      conscious and organised proletariat can win real, not sham,
      freedom for the people. Only the class-conscious and organised
      proletariat can thwart every attempt to deceive the people, to
      curtail their rights, to make them a mere tool in the hands of
      the bourgeoisie.
     

      Comrade workers! Let us then prepare with redoubled energy for the
      decisive battle that is at hand! Let the ranks of the Social-Democrat
      proletarians close ever firmer! Let their word spread ever farther
      afield! Let campaigning for the workers’ demands be carried on ever
      more boldly! Let the celebration of May Day win thousands of new fight
      ers to our cause and swell our forces in the great struggle for the
      freedom of all the people, for the liberation of all who toil from the
      yoke of capital!
     

      Long live the eight-hour day!
     

      Long live international revolutionary Social-Democracy!
     

      Down with the criminal and plundering tsarist autocracy!

  Lenin devoted several months to the writing of One Step Forward
      Two Steps Back (The Crisis in Our Party), making a careful
      study of the minutes and resolutions of the Second Party
      Congress, of the speeches of each of the delegates and the
      political groupings at the Congress, and of the Central
      Committee and Party Council documents.
    

      The book evoked fury among the Mensheviks. Plekhanov demanded
      that the Central Committee disavow it. The conciliators on the
      Central Committee tried to prevent its publication and
      circulation.
    

      Though published abroad, One Step Forward, Two Steps
      Back had a wide circulation among advanced workers in
      Russia. Copies of the book were found during arrests and
      house-searches in Moscow St. Petersburg, Riga, Saratov, Tula,
      Orel, Ufa, Perm, Kostroma Shchigri, Shavli (Kovno Gubernia), and
      elsewhere. Lenin included the book in the Twelvee Years
      collection published in 1907 (the date on the title-page is
      1908), omitting sections J, K, L, M, O, and P making
      abridgements in other sections, and adding a few explanatory
      notes.
    

      The present edition contains the full text as originally
      published in 1904 and all the additions made by the author in
      1907.

## Preface




Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: Preface








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)








Preface


      When a prolonged, stubborn and heated struggle is in progress,
      there usually begin to emerge after a time the central and
      fundamental points at issue, upon the decision of which the
      ultimate outcome of the campaign depends, and in comparison with
      which all the minor and petty episodes of the struggle recede
      more and more into the background.


      That, too, is how matters stand in the struggle within our
      Party, which for six months now has been riveting the attention
      of all members of the Party. And precisely because in the
      present outline of the whole struggle I have had to refer to
      many details which are of infinitesimal interest, and to many
      squabbles which at bottom are of no interest whatever, I should
      like from the very outset to draw the reader’s attention to two
      really central and fundamental points, points which are of
      tremendous interest, of undoubted historical significance, and
      which are the most urgent political questions confronting our
      Party today.


      The first question is that of the political significance of the
      division of our Party into “majority” and “minority” which took
      shape at the Second Party Congress and pushed all previous
      divisions among Russian Social-Democrats far into the
      background.


      The second question is that of the significance in principle of
      the new Iskra’s position on organisational questions,
      insofar as this position is really based on principle.


      The first question concerns the starting-point of the struggle
      in our Party, its source, its causes, and its fundamental
      political character. The second question concerns the ultimate
      outcome of the struggle, its finale, the sum-total of

 

      principles
      that results from adding up all that pertains to the realm of
      principle and subtracting all that pertains to the realm of
      squabbling. The answer to the first question is obtained by
      analysing the struggle at the Party Congress; the answer to the
      second, by analysing what is new in the principles of the new
      Iskra. Both these analyses, which make up nine-tenths
      of my pamphlet, lead to the conclusion that the “majority” is
      the revolutionary, and the “minority” the opportunist wing of
      our Party; the disagreements that divide the two wings at the
      present time for the most part concern, not questions of
      programme or tactics, but only organisational questions; the new
      system of views that emerges the more clearly in the new
      Iskra the more it tries to lend profundity to its
      position, and the more that position becomes cleared of
      squabbles about co-optation, is opportunism in matters of
      organisation.


      The principal shortcoming of the existing literature on the
      crisis in our Party is, as far as the study and elucidation of
      facts is concerned, the almost complete absence of an analysis
      of the minutes of the Party Congress; and as far as the
      elucidation of fundamental principles of organisation is
      concerned, the failure to analyse the connection which
      unquestionably exists between the basic error committed by
      Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod in their formulation of
      Paragraph 1 of the Rules and their defence of that formulation,
      on the one hand, and the whole “system” (insofar as one can
      speak here of a system) of Iskra’s present principles
      of organisation, on the other. The present editors of
      Iskra apparently do not even notice this connection,
      although the importance of the controversy over Paragraph 1 has
      been referred to again and again in the literature of the
      “majority”. As a matter of fact, Comrade Axelrod and Comrade
      Martov are now only deepening, developing and extending their
      initial error with regard to Paragraph 1. As a matter of fact,
      the entire position of the opportunists in organisational
      questions already began to be revealed in the controversy over
      Paragraph 1: their advocacy of a diffuse, not strongly welded,
      Party organisation; their hostility to the idea (the
      “bureaucratic” idea) of building the Party from the top
      downwards, starting from the Party Congress and the bodies set
      up by it; their tendency to proceed from the

 

      bottom upwards,
      allowing every professor, every high school student and “every
      striker” to declare himself a member of the Party; their
      hostility to the “formalism” which demands that a Party member
      should belong to one of the organisations recognised by the
      Party; their leaning towards the mentality of the bourgeois
      intellectual, who is only prepared to “accept organisational
      relations platonically”; their penchant for opportunist
      profundity and for anarchistic phrases; their tendency towards
      autonomism as against centralism—in a word, all that is now
      blossoming so luxuriantly in the new Iskra, and is
      helping more and more to reveal fully and graphically the
      initial error.


      As for the minutes of the Party Congress, the truly undeserved
      neglect of them can only be explained by the fact that our
      controversies have been cluttered by squabbles, and possibly by
      the fact that these minutes contain too large an amount of too
      unpalatable truth. The minutes of the Party Congress present a
      picture of the actual state of affairs in our Party that is
      unique of its kind and unparalleled for its accuracy,
      completeness, comprehensiveness, richness and authenticity; a
      picture of views, sentiments and plans drawn by the participants
      in the movement themselves; a picture of the political shades
      existing in the Party, showing their relative strength, their
      mutual relations and their struggles. It is the minutes of the
      Party Congress, and they alone, that show us how far we have
      really succeeded in making a clean sweep of the survivals of the
      old, purely circle ties and substituting for them a single great
      party tie. It is the duty of every Party member who wishes to
      take an intelligent share in the affairs of his Party to make a
      careful study of our Party Congress. I say study advisedly, for
      merely to read the mass of raw material contained in the minutes
      is not enough to obtain a picture of the Congress. Only by
      careful and independent study can one reach (as one should) a
      stage where the brief digests of the speeches, the dry extracts
      from the debates, the petty skirmishes over minor (seemingly
      minor) issues will combine to form one whole, enabling the Party
      member to conjure up the living figure of each prominent speaker
      and to obtain a full idea of the political complexion of each
      group of delegates to the Party Congress. If the writer of these
      lines only succeeds in

 

      stimulating the reader to make a broad
      and independent study of the minutes of the Party Congress, he
      will feel that his work was not done in vain.


      One more word to the opponents of Social-Democracy. They gloat
      and grimace over our disputes; they will, of course, try to pick
      isolated passages from my pamphlet, which deals with the
      failings and shortcomings of our Party, and to use them for
      their own ends. The Russian Social-Democrats are already steeled
      enough in battle not to be perturbed by these pinpricks and to
      continue, in spite of them, their work of self-criticism and
      ruthless exposure of their own shortcomings, which will
      unquestionably and inevitably be overcome as the working-class
      movement grows. As for our opponents, let them try to give us a
      picture of the true state of affairs in their own “parties” even
      remotely approximating that given by the minutes of our Second
      Congress!

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



A. The Preparations For The Congress

      There is a saying that everyone is entitled to curse his judges
      for twenty-four hours. Our Party Congress, like any congress of
      any party, was also the judge of certain persons, who laid claim
      to the position of leaders but who met with discomfiture. Today
      these representatives of the “minority” are, with a
      naïveté verging on the pathetic, “cursing their
      judges” and doing their best to discredit the Congress, to
      belittle its importance and authority. This striving has been
      expressed most vividly, perhaps, in an article in
      Iskra, No. 57, by “Practical

Worker”,[4]
who feels out
      raged at the idea of the Congress being a sovereign
      “divinity”. This is so characteristic a trait of the new
      Iskra that it cannot be passed over in silence. The
      editors, the majority of whom were rejected by the
      Congress, continue, on the one hand, to call themselves a
      “Party” editorial board, while, on the other, they accept with
      open arms people who declare that the Congress was not
      divine. Charming, is it not? To be sure, gentlemen, the Congress
      was not divine; but what must we think of people who begin to
      “blackguard” the Congress after they have met with
      defeat at it?


      For indeed, let us recall the main facts in the history of the
      preparations for the Congress.


Iskra declared at the very outset, in its announcement
      of publication in 1900, that before we could unite, lines of
      demarcation must be drawn. Iskra endeavoured to make
      the Conference of

1902[5] a private meeting and not a Party

 Congress.[1]
Iskra acted with extreme
      caution in the summer and autumn of 1902 when it re-established
      the Organising

 

      Committee elected at that conference. At last the
      work of demarcation was finished—as we all
      acknowledged. The Organising Committee was constituted at the
      very end of 1902. Iskra welcomed its firm
      establishment, and in an editorial article in its 32nd
      issue declared that the convocation of a Party Congress was a
      most urgent and pressing

necessity.[2]

Thus, the last thing we can be
      accused of is having been hasty in convening the Second
      Congress. We were, in fact, guided by the maxim: measure your
      cloth seven times before you cut it; and we had every moral
      right to expect that after the cloth had been cut our comrades
      would not start complaining and measuring it all over again.


      The Organising Committee drew up very precise (formalistic and
      bureaucratic, those would say who are now using these words to
      cover up their political spinelessness) Regulations for the
      Second Congress, got them passed by all the committees, and
      finally endorsed them, stipulating among other things, in Point
      18, that “all decisions of the Congress and all the elections it
      carries out are decisions of the Party and binding on all Party
      organisations. They cannot be challenged by anyone on any
      pretext whatever and can be rescinded or amended only by the
      next Party

       Congress”.[3]

How innocent in
      themselves, are they not, are these words, accepted at the time
      without a murmur, as something axiomatic; yet how strange they
      sound today—like a verdict against the “minority”! Why was
      this point included? Merely as a formality? Of course not. This
      provision seemed necessary, and was indeed necessary, because
      the Party consisted of a number of isolated and independent
      groups, which might refuse to recognise the Congress. This
      provision in fact expressed the free will of all the
      revolutionaries (which is now being talked about so much, and so
      irrelevantly, the term “free” being euphemistically applied to
      what really deserves the epithet “capricious”). It was
      equivalent to a word of honour mutually pledged by all
      the Russian Social-Democrats. It was intended to guarantee that
      all the tremendous effort, danger and expense entailed by the
      Congress should not be in vain, that the Congress

 

      should not be
      turned into a farce. It in advance qualified any refusal to
      recognise the decisions and elections at the Congress as a
      breach of faith.


      Who is it, then, that the new Iskra is scoffing at when
      it makes the new discovery that the Congress was not divine and
      its decisions are not sacrosanct? Does that discovery imply “new
      views on organisation”, or only new attempts to cover up old
      tracks?

The conference of 1902—a conference of
      representatives of R.S.D.L.P. committees held on March 23-28
      (April 5-10), 1902, in Belostok. The Economists and Bundists
      intended to proclaim this conference a Party Congress; a report
      drawn up by Lenin and presented by the Iskra delegate
      proved that the gathering lacked proper preparation and
      authority to constitute itself such. The conference set up an
      Organising Committee to convene the Second Party Congress, but
      nearly all its members were arrested soon after. A new
      Organising Committee to convene the Second Congress was formed
      in November 1902 at a conference in Pskov. Lenin’s views on the
      Belostok conference are set forth in his “Report of the Iskra
      Editorial Board to the Meeting (Conference) of
      R.S.D.L.P. Committees”.

## 
Significance of the Various
Groupings at the Congress 




Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: B. Significance of the Various Groupings at the Congress








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



B. Significance of the Various Groupings at the Congress

      Thus, the Congress was called after the most careful preparation
      and on the basis of the fullest representation. The general
      recognition that its composition was correct and its decisions
      absolutely binding found expression also in the
      statement of the chairman (Minutes, p. 54) after the Congress
      had been constituted.


      What was the principal task of the Congress? To create a real
      party on the basis of the principles and organisational ideas
      that had been advanced and elaborated by Iskra. That
      this was the direction in which the Congress had to work was
      predetermined by the three years’ activities of Iskra
      and by the recognition of the latter by the majority of the
      committees. Iskra’s programme and trend were to become
      the programme and trend of the Party; Iskra’s
      organisational plans were to be embodied in the Rules of
      Organisation of the Party. But it goes without saying that this
      could not be achieved without a struggle: since the Congress was
      so highly representative, the participants included
      organisations which had vigorously fought Iskra (the
      Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo ) and organisations which,
      while verbally recognising Iskra as the leading organ,
      actually pursued plans of their own and were unstable in matters
      of principle (the Yuzhny Rabochy group and delegates
      from some of the committees who were closely associated with
      it). Under these circumstances, the Congress could not but
      become an arena of struggle for the victory of the
      "Iskra " trend. That it did become such an
      arena will at once be apparent to all who peruse its minutes
      with any degree of attention. Our task now is to trace in detail
      the principal groupings revealed at the Congress on various
      issues and to

 

      reconstruct, on the basis of the precise data of
      the minutes, the political complexion of each of the main
      groups. What precisely were these groups, trends and shades
      which, at the Congress, were to unite under the guidance of
      Iskra into a single party?—that is what we must
      show by analysing the debates and the voting. The elucidation of
      this is of cardinal importance both for a study of what our
      Social Democrats really are and for an understanding of the
      causes of the divergence among them. That is why, in my speech
      at the League Congress and in my letter to the editors of the
      new Iskra, I gave prime place to an analysis of the
      various groupings. My opponents of the “minority” (headed by
      Martov) utterly failed to grasp the substance of the
      question. At the League Congress they confined themselves to
      corrections of detail, trying to “vindicate” themselves from the
      charge of having swung towards opportunism, but not even
      attempting to counter my picture of the groupings at the
      Congress by drawing any different one. Now Martov tries
      in Iskra (No. 56) to represent every attempt clearly to
      delimit the various political groups at the Congress as mere
      “circle politics”. Strong language, Comrade Martov! But the
      strong language of the new Iskra has this peculiar
      quality: one has only to reproduce all the stages of our
      divergence, from the Congress onwards, for all this strong
      language to turn completely and primarily against the
      present editorial board. Take a look at yourselves, you
      so-called Party editors who talk about circle politics!


      Martov now finds the facts of our struggle at the Congress so
      unpleasant that he tries to slur over them altogether. “An
      Iskra-ist,” he says, "is one who, at the Party Congress
      and prior to it, expressed his complete solidarity with
      Iskra, advocated its programme and its views on
      organisation and supported its organisational policy. There were
      over forty such Iskra-ists at the Congress—that
      was the number of votes cast for Iskra’s programme and
      for the resolution adopting Iskra as the Central Organ
      of the Party." Open the Congress Minutes, and you will find that
      the programme was adopted by the votes of all (p. 233) except
      Akimov, who abstained. Thus, Comrade Martov wants to assure us
      that the Bundists, and Brouckere, and Martynov
      demonstrated their “complete solidarity” with
      Iskra and advocated its views

 

      on organisation!
      This is ridiculous. The fact that after the Congress
      all who took part became equal members of the Party
      (and not even all, for the Bundists had withdrawn) is here
      jumbled with the question of the grouping that evoked the
      struggle at the Congress. Instead of a study of the
      elements that went to make up the “majority” and the
      “minority” after the Congress, we get the official phrase,
      “recognised the programme”!


      Take the voting on the adoption of Iskra as the Central
      Organ. You will see that it was Martynov—whom Comrade
      Martov, with a courage worthy of a better cause, now credits
      with having advocated Iskra’s organisational views and
      organisational policy—who insisted on separating the two
      parts of the resolution: the bare adoption of Iskra as
      the Central Organ, and the recognition of its services. When the
      first part of the resolution (recognising the services of
      Iskra, expressing solidarity with it) was put
      to the vote, only thirty five votes were cast in
      favour; there were two votes against (Akimov and Brouckère)
      and eleven abstentions (Martynov, the five Bundists and the five
      votes of the editorial board: the two votes each of Martov and
      myself and Plekhanov’s one). Consequently, the
      anti-Iskra group (five Bundists and three Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ists) is quite apparent in this instance also, one
      most advantageous to Martov’s present views and chosen by
      himself. Take the voting on the second part of the
      resolution—adopting Iskra as the Central Organ
      without any statement of motives or expression of solidarity
      (Minutes, p. 147): forty-four votes in favour, which
      the Martov of today classes as Iskra-ist. The total
      number of votes to be cast was fifty-one; subtracting the five
      votes of the editors, who abstained, we get forty-six; two voted
      against (Akimov and Brouckère); consequently, the
      remaining forty-four include all five Bundists. And so,
      the Bundists at the Congress “expressed complete solidarity with
      Iskra”—this is how official history is written by
      the official Iskra! Running ahead somewhat, we will
      explain to the reader the real reasons for this official truth:
      the present editorial board of Iskra could and would
      have been a real Party editorial board (and not a quasi-Party
      one, as it is today) if the Bundists and the “Rabocheye
      Dyelo”-ists had not withdrawn from the Congress; that is
      why these trusty guardians of the present, so-called

 

      Party
      editorial board had to be proclaimed Iskra-ists. But I
      shall speak of this in greater detail later.


      The next question is: if the Congress was a struggle between the
      Iskra-ist and the anti-Iskra-ist elements,
      were there no intermediate, unstable elements who vacillated
      between the two? Anyone at all familiar with our Party and with
      the picture generally presented by congresses of every kind will
      be inclined a priori to answer the question in the
      affirmative. Comrade Martov is now very reluctant to recall
      these unstable elements, so he represents the Yuzhny
      Rabochy group and the delegates who gravitated towards it
      as typical Iskra-ists, and our differences with them as
      paltry and unimportant. Fortunately, we now have before us the
      complete text of the minutes and are able to answer the
      question—a question of fact, of course—on the basis of
      documentary evidence. What we said above about the general
      grouping at the Congress does not, of course, claim to answer
      the question, but only to present it correctly.


      Without an analysis of the political groupings, without having a
      picture of the Congress as a struggle between definite shades,
      the divergence between us cannot be understood at all. Martov’s
      attempt to gloss over the different shades by ranking even the
      Bundists with the Iskra-ists is simply an evasion of
      the question. Even a priori, on the basis of the
      history of the Russian Social-Democratic movement before the
      Congress, three main groups are to be noted (for subsequent
      verification and detailed study): the Iskra-ists, the
      anti-Iskra-ists, and the unstable, vacillating,
      wavering elements.

Beginning of the Congress. The
Organising Committee Incident




Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: C. Beginning of the Congress. The Organising Committee Incident








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



C. Beginning of the Congress. The Organising Committee
    Incident

      The most convenient way to analyse the debates and the voting is
      to take them in the order of the Congress sittings, so as
      successively to note the political shades as they became more
      and more apparent. Only when absolutely necessary will
      departures from the chronological order be made for the purpose
      of considering together closely allied questions or similar
      groupings. For the sake of impartiality, we shall endeavour to
      mention all the more important votes, omitting,

 

      of course, the
      innumerable votes on minor issues, which took up an inordinate
      amount of time at our Congress (owing partly to our inexperience
      and inefficiency in dividing the material between the
      commissions and the plenary sittings, and partly to quibbling
      which bordered on obstruction).


      The first question to evoke a debate which began to reveal
      differences of shades was whether first place should be given
      (on the Congress “order of business”) to the item: “Position of
      the Bund in the Party” (Minutes, pp. 29-33). From the standpoint
      of the Iskra-ists, which was advocated by

      Plekhanov, Martov,

      Trotsky,
      and myself, there could be no doubt on this score. The Bund’s
      withdrawal from the Party strikingly bore out our view: if the
      Bund refused to go our way and accept the principles of
      organisation which the majority of the Party shared with
      Iskra, it was useless and senseless to “make believe”
      that we were going the same way and only drag out the Congress
      (as the Bundists did drag it out). The matter had already been
      fully clarified in our literature, and it was apparent to any at
      all thoughtful Party member that all that remained was to put
      the question frankly, and bluntly and honestly make the choice:
      autonomy (in which case we go the same way), or federation (in
      which case our ways part).


      Evasive in their entire policy, the Bundists wanted to be
      evasive here too and postpone the matter. They were joined by
      Comrade Akimov, who, evidently on behalf of all the followers of
      Rabocheye Dyelo, at once brought up the differences
      with Iskra over questions of organisation (Minutes,
      p. 31). The Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo were supported by
      Comrade Makhov (representing the two votes of the Nikolayev
      Committee—which shortly before had expressed its solidarity
      with Iskra!). To Comrade Makhov the matter was
      altogether unclear, and another “sore spot”, he considered, was
      “the question of a democratic system or, on the contrary [mark
      this!], centralism”—exactly like the majority of our
      present “Party” editorial board, who at the Congress had not yet
      noticed this “sore spot”!


      Thus the Iskra-ists were opposed by the Bund,
      Rabocheye Dyelo and Comrade Makhov, who together
      controlled the ten votes which were cast against us
      (p. 33). Thirty votes were cast in
      favour—this is the figure, as we shall see

 

      later,
      around which the votes of the Iskra-ists often
      fluctuated. Eleven abstained, apparently not taking the side of
      either of the contending “parties”. It is interesting to note
      that when we took the vote on Paragraph 2 of the Rules of the
      Bund (it was the rejection of this Paragraph 2 that caused the
      Bund to withdraw from the Party), the votes in favour of it and
      the abstentions also amounted to ten (Minutes, p. 289), the
      abstainers being the three Rabocheye Dyelo-ists
      (Brouckère, Martynov, and Akimov) and Comrade
      Makhov. Clearly, the grouping in the vote on the place
      of the Bund item on the agenda was not fortuitous.
      Clearly, all these comrades differed with Iskra not
      only on the technical question of the order of discussion, but
      in essence as well. In the case of Rabocheye
      Dyelo, this difference in essence is clear to everyone,
      while Comrade Makhov gave an inimitable description of his
      attitude in the speech he made on the withdrawal of the Bund
      (Minutes, pp. 289-90). It is worth while dwelling on this
      speech. Comrade Makhov said that after the resolution rejecting
      federation, “the position of the Bund in the R.S.D.L.P. ceased
      to be for me a question of principle and became a question of
      practical politics in relation to an historically evolved
      national organisation”. “Here,” the speaker continued, “I could
      not but take into account all the consequences that might follow
      from our vote, and would therefore have voted for Paragraph 2 in
      its entirety.” Comrade Makhov has admirably imbibed the spirit
      of “practical politics”: in principle he had already
      rejected federation, and therefore in practice he
      would have voted for including in the Rules a point that
      signified federation! And this “practical” comrade explained his
      profound position of principle in the following words: “But [the
      famous Shchedrin “but”!] since my voting one way or the other
      would only have significance in principle [!!] and could not be
      of any practical importance, in view of the almost unanimous
      vote of all the other Congress delegates, I preferred to abstain
      in order to bring out in principle [God preserve us from such
      principles!] the difference between my position on this question
      and the position of the Bund delegates, who voted in
      favour. Conversely, I would have voted in favour if the Bund
      delegates had abstained, as they had at first insisted.” Can you
      make head or tail of it? A man of principle abstains

 

      from loudly
      saying “Yes” because practically it is useless when everybody
      else says “No”.


      After the vote on the place of the Bund item on the agenda, the
      question of the Borba group cropped up at the Congress; it too
      led to an extremely interesting grouping and was closely bound
      up with the “sorest” point at the Congress, namely, the personal
      composition of the central bodies. The committee appointed to
      determine the composition of the Congress pronounced against
      inviting the Borba group, in accordance with a
      twice-adopted decision of the Organising Committee (see
      Minutes, pp. 383 and 375) and the report of the latter’s
      representatives on this committee (p. 35).


      Thereupon Comrade Egorov, a member of the Organising
      Committee, declared that “the question of Borba” (mark, of
      Borba, not of some particular member of it) was “new to him”,
      and demanded an adjournment. How a question on which the
      Organising Committee had twice taken a decision could be new to
      a member of the Organising Committee remains a mystery. During
      the adjournment the Organising Committee held a meeting
      (Minutes, p. 40), attended by such of its members as happened to
      be at the Congress (several members of theOrganising Committee,
      old members of the Iskra organisation, were not at the

Congress).[1]

Then began a
      debate about Borba. The Rabocheye Dyelo-ists spoke in
      favour (Martynov, Akimov, and Brouckère—pp. 36-38),
      the Iskra-ists (Pavlovich, Sorokin,

Lange,[3] Trotsky,
      Martov, and others)—against. Again the Congress split up
      into the grouping with which we are already familiar. The
      struggle over Borba was a stubborn one, and Comrade Martov made
      a very circumstantial (p. 38) and “militant” speech, in which he
      rightly referred to “inequality of representation” of the groups
      in Russia and abroad, and said that it would hardly be “well” to
      allow a foreign group any “privilege” (golden words,
      particularly edifying today, in the light of the events since
      the Congress!), and that we should not encourage "the
      organisational chaos in the Party that was characterised by a
      disunity not justified by any considerations

 

      of principle" (one
      right in the eye for . . . the “minority” at our Party
      Congress!). Except for the followers of Rabocheye
      Dyelo, nobody came out openly and with reasoned
      motives in favour of Borba until the list of speakers was closed
      (p. 40). It should be said in fairness to Comrade Akimov and his
      friends that they at least did not wriggle and hide, but frankly
      advocated their line, frankly said what they wanted.


After the list of speakers had been closed, when it was
      already out of order to speak on the issue itself,
      Comrade Egorov “insistently demanded that a decision just
      adopted by the Organising Committee be heard”. It is not
      surprising that the delegates were outraged at this manoeuvre,
      and Comrade Plekhanov, the chairman, expressed his “astonishment
      that Comrade Egorov should insist upon his demand”. One thing or
      the other, one would think: either take an open and definite
      stand before the whole Congress on the question at issue, or say
      nothing at all. But to allow the list of speakers to be closed
      and then, under the guise of a “reply to the debate”, confront
      the Congress with a new decision of the Organising
      Committee on the very subject that had been under discussion,
      was like a stab in the back!


      When the sitting was resumed after dinner, the Bureau still in
      perplexity, decided to waive “formalities” and resort to the
      last method, adopted at congresses only in extreme cases, viz.,
      “comradely explanation”. The spokesman of the Organising
      Committee, Popov, announced the committee’s decision, which had
      been adopted by all its members against one, Pavlovich (p. 43),
      and which recommended the Congress to invite Ryazanov.


      Pavlovich declared that he had challenged and continued to
      challenge the lawfulness of the Organising Committee meeting,
      and that the Committee’s new decision “contradicts its
      earlier decision”. This statement caused an uproar. Comrade
      Egorov, also an Organising Committee member and a member of the
      Yuzhny Rabochy group, evaded answering on the actual
      point in question and tried to make the central issue one of
      discipline. He claimed that Comrade Pavlovich had violated Party
      discipline (!), for, having heard his protest, the Organising
      Committee had decided “not to lay Pavlovich’s dissenting opinion
      before the Congress”. The debate shifted to the question of
      Party discipline, and Plekhanov,

 

      amid the loud applause of the
      delegates, explained for the edification of Comrade Egorov that
      “we have no such thing as binding instructions” (p. 42;
      cf. p. 379, Regulations for the Congress, Point 7: “The powers
      of delegates must not be restricted by binding instructions. In
      the exercise of their powers, delegates are absolutely free and
      independent”). “The Congress is the supreme Party authority”,
      and, consequently, he violates Party discipline and the Congress
      Regulations who in any way restricts any delegate in taking
      directly to the Congress any question of Party
      life whatsoever. The issue thus came down to this: circles or a
      party? Were the rights of delegates to be restricted at the
      Congress in the name of the imaginary rights or rules of the
      various bodies and circles, or were all lower bodies and old
      groups to be completely, and not nominally but
      actually, disbanded in face of the Congress, pending the
      creation of genuinely Party official institutions? The reader
      will already see from this how profoundly important from the
      standpoint of principle was this dispute at the very outset (the
      third sitting) of this Congress whose purpose was the actual
      restoration of the Party. Focused in this dispute, as it were,
      was the conflict between the old circles and small groups (such
      as Yuzhny Rabochy) and the renascent Party. And the
      anti-Iskra groups at once revealed themselves: the
      Bundist Abramson, Comrade Martynov, that ardent ally of the
      present Iskra editorial board, and our friend Cornrade
      Makhov all sided with Egorov and the Yuzhny Rabochy
      group against Pavlovich. Comrade Martynov, who now vies with
      Martov and Axelrod in sporting “democracy” in organisation, even
      cited the example of . . . the army, where an appeal to a
      superior authority can only be made through a lower one!! The
      true meaning of this “compact” anti-Iskra opposition
      was quite clear to everyone who was present at the Congress or
      who had carefully followed the internal history of our Party
      prior to the Congress. It was the purpose of the opposition
      (perhaps not always realised by all of its representatives, and
      sometimes pursued by force of inertia) to guard the
      independence, individualism and parochial interests of the
      small, petty groups from being swallowed up in the broad Party
      that was being built on the Iskra principles.



      It was precisely from this angle that the question was
      approached by Comrade Martov, who had not yet joined forces with
      Martynov. Comrade Martov vigorously took the field, and rightly
      so, against those whose “notion of Party discipline does not go
      beyond a revolutionary’s duty to the particular group of a
      lower order to which he belongs”. “No
      compulsory [Martov’s italics] grouping can be tolerated
      within a united Party,” he explained to the champions of the
      circle mentality, not foreseeing what a flail these words would
      be for his own political conduct at the end of the Congress and
      after.... A compulsory grouping cannot be tolerated in the
      case of the Organising Committee, but can quite well be
      tolerated in the case of the editorial board. Martov condemns a
      compulsory grouping when he looks at it from the centre, but
      Martov defends it the moment he finds himself dissatisfied with
      the composition of the centre....


      It is interesting to note that in his speech Comrade Martov laid
      particular stress not only on Comrade Egorov’s “profound error”,
      but also on the political instability the Organising Committee
      had displayed. “A recommendation has been submitted on behalf of
      the Organising Committee,” he exclaimed in just indignation,
      “which runs counter to the committee report [based, we
      will add, on the report of members of the Organising
      Committee—p. 43, Koltsov’s remarks] and to the
      Organising Committee’s own earlier recommendations.” (My
      italics.) As we see, at that time, before his
      “swing-over”, Martov clearly realised that substituting Ryazanov
      for Borba in no way removed the utter contradictoriness and
      inconsistency of the Organising Committee’s actions (Party
      members may learn from the League Congress Minutes, p. 57, how
      Martov conceived the matter after his swing-over). Martov did
      not confine himself then to analysing the issue of discipline;
      he bluntly asked the Organising Committee: “What new
      circumstance has arisen to necessitate the change?” (My
      italics.) And, indeed, when the Organ ising Committee made its
      recommendation, it did not even have the courage to defend its
      opinion openly, as Akimov and the others did. Martov denies this
      (League Minutes p. 56), but whoever reads the minutes of the
      Congress will see that he is mistaken. Popov, in submitting the
      Organising Committee recommendation, did not say a word
      about the

 

      motives (Party Congress Minutes, p. 41). Egorov
      shifted the issue to one of discipline, and all he said on the
      question itself was: "The Organising Committee may have had new
      reasons [but whether it did, and what those new reasons were, is
      unknown]; it could have forgotten to nominate somebody, and so
      on. [This “and so on” was the speaker’s sole refuge, for the
      Organising Committee could not have forgotten about
      Borba, which it had discussed twice before the Congress and once
      in the committee.] The Organising Committee did not adopt this
      decision because it has changed its attitude towards the Borba
      group, but because it wants to remove unnecessary rocks in the
      path of the Party’s future central organisation at the very
      outset of its activities." This is not a reason, but an evasion
      of a reason. Every sincere Social-Democrat (and we do not
      entertain the least doubt about the sincerity of any Congress
      delegate) is concerned to remove what he considers to
      be sunken rocks, and to remove them by those methods
      which he considers advisable. Giving reasons means
      explicitly stating and explaining one’s view of things, and not
      making shift with truisms. And they could not give a reason
      without “changing their attitude towards Borba”, because in its
      earlier and contrary decisions the Organising Committee had also
      been concerned to remove sunken rocks, but it had then regarded
      the very opposite as “rocks”. And Comrade Martov very severely
      and very rightly attacked this argument, saying that it was
      “petty” and inspired by a wish to “burke the
      issue”, and advising the Organising Committee “not to
      be afraid of what people will say”. These words
      characterise perfectly the essential nature of the political
      shade which played so large a part at the Congress and which is
      distinguished precisely by its want of independence, its
      pettiness, its lack of a line of its own, its fear of what
      people will say, its constant vacillation between the two
      definite sides, its fear of plainly stating its
      credo—in a word, by all the features of a

     “Marsh”.[2]
[2]
There are people in our Party today
      who are horrified when they hear this word, and raise an outcry
      about uncomradely methods of controversy. A strange perversion
      of sensibility due to . . . a misapplied sense of official form!
      There is scarcely a political party acquainted with internal
      struggles that has managed to do without this term, by which the
      unstable elements who vacillate between the contending

  

sides
      have always been designated. Even the Germans, who know how to
      keep their internal struggles within very definite bounds
      indeed, are not offended by the word versumpft (sunk in
      the marsh—Ed.) are not horrified, and do not
      display ridiculous official prudery. —Lenin




      A consequence of this political spinelessness of the unstable
      group was, incidentally, that no one except the Bundist
      Yudin (p. 53) did put before the Congress a resolution to invite
      one of the members of the Borba group. Yudin’s resolution
      received five votes—all Bundists, apparently: the
      vacillating elements had changed sides again! How large was the
      vote of the middle group is shown approximately by the voting on
      the resolutions of Koltsov and Yudin on this question: the
      Iskra-ist received thirty-two votes (p. 47), the
      Bundist received sixteen, that is, in addition to the eight
      anti-Iskra-ist votes, the two votes of Comrade Makhov
      (cf. p. 46), the four votes of the members of the Yuzhny
      Rabochy group, and two others. We shall show in a moment
      that this alignment can by no means be regarded as accidental;
      but first let us briefly note Martov’s present opinion
      of this Organising Committee incident. Martov maintained at the
      League that “Pavlovich and others fanned passions”. One has only
      to consult the Congress Minutes to see that the longest, most
      heated and sharpest speeches against Borba and the Organising
      Committee were delivered by Martov himself. By trying to lay the
      “blame” on Pavlovich he only demonstrates his own instability:
      it was Pavlovich he helped to elect prior to the Congress as the
      seventh member of the editorial board; at the Congress he fully
      associated himself with Pavlovich (p. 44) against Egorov; but
      afterwards, having suffered defeat at the hands of Pavlovich, he
      began to accuse him of “fanning passions”. This is ludicrous.


      Martov waxes ironical in Iskra (No. 56) over the
      importance that was attached to whether X or Y should be
      invited. But again the irony turns against Martov, for it was
      this Organising Committee incident that started the dispute over
      such an “important” question as inviting X or Y on to the
      Central Committee or the Central Organ. It is unseemly to
      measure with two different yardsticks, depending on whether the
      matter concerns your own “group of a lower order”
      (relative to the Party) or someone else’s. This is
      precisely a philistine and circle, not a Party attitude. A
      simple comparison

 

      of Martov’s speech at the League (p. 57) with
      his speech at the Congress (p. 44) sufficiently demonstrates
      this. “I can not understand,” Martov said, inter alia,
      at the League, “how people can insist on calling themselves
      Iskra-ists and at the same time be ashamed of being
      Iskra-ists.” A strange failure to understand the
      difference between “calling oneself” and “being”—between
      word and deed. Martov himself, at the Congress, called
      himself an opponent of compulsory groupings, yet, after the
      Congress, came to be a supporter of them....

## 
Dissolution of the Yuzhny
  Rabochi Group




Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: D. Dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy Group








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



D. Dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy Group

      The alignment of the delegates over the Organising Committee
      question may perhaps seem accidental. But such an opinion would
      be wrong, and in order to dispel it we shall depart from the
      chronological order and at once examine an incident which
      occurred at the end of the Congress, but which was very closely
      connected with the one just discussed. This incident was the
      dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group. The
      organisational trend of Iskra—complete
      amalgamation of the Party forces and removal of the chaos
      dividing them—came into conflict here with the interests of
      one of the groups, which had done useful work when there was no
      real party, but which had become superfluous now that the work
      was being centralised. From the standpoint of circle interests,
      the Yuzhny Rabochy group was entitled no less than the
      old Iskra editorial board to lay claim to “continuity”
      and inviolability. But in the interests of the Party, it was its
      duty to submit to the transfer of its forces to “the appropriate
      Party organisations” (p. 313, end of resolution adopted by the
      Congress). From the standpoint of circle interests and
      “philistinism”, the dissolution of a useful group, which no more
      desired it than did the old Iskra editorial board,
      could not but seem a “ticklish matter” (the expression used by
      Comrade Rusov and Comrade Deutsch). But from the standpoint of
      the interests of the Party, its dissolution, its “assimilation”
      in the Party (Gusev’s expression), was essential. The Yuzhny
      Rabochy group bluntly declared that it “did not deem it
      necessary” to proclaim itself dissolved and demanded that “the
      Congress definitely pronounce its opinion”, and

 

      pronounce it
      “immediately: yes or no”. The Yuzhny Rabochy group
      openly invoked the same “continuity” as the old Iskra
      editorial board began to invoke . . . after it was dissolved!
      “Although we are all individually members of one Party,” Comrade
      Egorov said, “it nevertheless consists of a number of
      organisations, with which we have to reckon as historical
      entities.... If such an organisation is not
      detrimental to the Party, there is no need to dissolve
      it.”


      Thus an important question of principle was quite
      definitely raised, and all the Iskra-ists—inasmuch
      as their own circle interests had not yet come to the
      forefront—took a decisive stand against the unstable
      elements (the Bundists and two of the Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ists had already withdrawn from the Congress; they
      would undoubtedly have been heart and soul in favour of
      “reckoning with historical entities”). The result of the vote
      was thirty-one for, five against and five abstentions
      (the four votes of .the members of the Yuzhny Rabochy
      group and one other, that of Byelov, most likely, judging by his
      earlier pronouncements, p. 308). A group of ten votes
      distinctly opposed to Iskra’s consistent organisational
      plan and defending the circle spirit as against the party spirit
      can be quite definitely discerned here. During the debate the
      Iskra-ists presented the question precisely from the
      standpoint of principle (see Lange’s speech, p. 315), opposing
      parochial amateurishness and disunity, refusing to pay heed to
      the “sympathies” of individual organisations, and plainly
      declaring that “if the comrades of Yuzhny Rabochy had
      adhered more strictly to principle earlier, a year or two ago,
      the unity of the Party and the triumph of the programme
      principles we have sanctioned here would have been achieved
      sooner”. Orlov, Gusev, Lyadov, Muravyov, Rusov, Pavlovich,
      Glebov, and Gorin all spoke in this strain. And far from
      protesting against these definite and repeated references made
      at the Congress to the lack of principle in the policy and
      “line” of Yuzhny Rabochy, of Makhov and of others, far
      from making any reservation on this score, the
      Iskra-ists of the “minority”, in the person of Deutsch,
      vigorously associated themselves with these views, condemned
      “chaos”, and welcomed the “blunt way the question was put”
      (p. 315) by that very same Comrade Rusov who, at this same
      sitting, had the audacity—oh,

 

      horror!—to “bluntly
      put” the question of the old editorial board too on a purely
      Party basis (p. 325).


      On the part of the Yuzhny Rabochy group the proposal to
      dissolve it evoked violent indignation, traces of which are to
      be found in the minutes (it should not be forgotten that the
      minutes offer only a pale reflection of the debates, for they do
      not give the full speeches, but only very condensed summaries
      and extracts). Comrade Egorov even described as a “lie” the bare
      mention of the Rabochaya

Mysl[1]
      group  alongside of
      Yuzhny Rabochy—a characteristic sample of the
      attitude that prevailed at the Congress towards consistent
      Economism. Even much later, at the 37th sitting, Egorov spoke of
      the dissolution of Yuzhny Rabochy with the utmost
      irritation (p. 356), requesting to have it recorded in the
      minutes that during the discussion on Yuzhny Rabochy
      the members of the group had not been asked either about
      publication funds or about control by the Central Organ and the
      Central Committee. Comrade Popov hinted, during the debate on
      Yuzhny Rabochy, at a compact majority having
      predetermined the fate of the group. “Now,” he said (p. 316),
      “after the speeches of Comrades Gusev and Orlov, everything
      is clear.” The meaning of these words is unmistakable: now,
      after the Iskra-ists had stated their opinion and moved
      a resolution, everything was clear, i.e., it was clear that
      Yuzhny Rabochy would be dissolved, against its own
      wishes. Here the Yuzhny Rabochy spokesman himself drew
      a distinction between the Iskra-ists (and, moreover,
      Iskra-ists like Gusev and Orlov) and his own
      supporters, as representing different “lines” of organisational
      policy. And when the present-day Iskra represents the
      Yuzhny Rabochy group (and Makhov too, most likely?) as
      “typical Iskra-ists”, it only demonstrates that the new
      editorial board has forgotten the most important (from this
      group’s standpoint) events of the Congress and is anxious to
      cover up the evidence showing what elements went to form what is
      known as the “minority”.


      Unfortunately, the question of a popular periodical was not
      discussed at the Congress. It was very actively discussed by all
      the Iskra-ists both before the Congress and during the
      Congress itself, outside the sittings, and they agreed that it
      would be highly irrational at this moment in the

 

      Party’s life to
      launch such a publication or convert any of the existing ones
      for the purpose. The anti-Iskra-ists expressed the
      opposite opinion at the Congress; so did the Yuzhny
      Rabochy group in their report; and the fact that a motion
      to this effect, with ten signatures, was not tabled can only be
      attributed to chance, or to a disinclination to raise a
      “hopeless” issue.


 

Notes
 
 


[1]
Rabochaya Mysl (Worker’s Thought) was an Economist group which
      published a paper under this name. The paper, edited by K. M.  Takhtarev and
      others, appeared from October 1897 to December 1902; 16 issues were
      published altogether.
    


Rabochaya Mysl advocated frankly opportunist views. It opposed the
      political struggle and restricted the tasks of the working-class movement to
      “the interests of the moment”, to pressing for individual
      partial reforms, chiefly of an economic nature. Glorifying
      “spontaneity” in the movement, it opposed the creation of an
      independent proletarian party and belittled the importance of revolutionary
      theory and consciousness, maintaining that the socialist ideology could grow
      out of the spontaneous movement.

      The views expounded by Rabochaya Mysl, as the Russian variety of
    international opportunism, were criticised by Lenin in the article “A
    Retrograde Trend in Russian Social-Democracy” (present edition, Vol. 4,
    pp. 255-85), in his Iskra articles, and in What Is To Be
    Done?

## Equality of
      Languages




Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: E. The Equality of Languages Incident








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



E. The Equality of Languages Incident

      Let us return to the chronological order of the Congress
      sittings.
    

      We have now convincingly seen that even before the Congress
      proceeded to discuss its actual business, there was clearly
      revealed not only a perfectly definite group of
      anti-Iskra-ists (eight votes), but also a group of
      intermediate and unstable elements prepared to support the eight
      anti-Iskra-ists and increase their votes to roughly
      sixteen or eighteen.


      The question of the position of the Bund in the Party, which was
      discussed at the Congress in extreme, excessive detail, reduced
      itself to deciding about the principle, while its practical
      decision was postponed until the discussion on
      organisation. Since the points involved had been given quite a
      lot of space in the press prior to the Congress, the discussion
      at the Congress produced relatively little that was new. It
      must, however, be mentioned that the supporters of Rabocheye
      Dyelo (Martynov, Akimov, and Brouckère), while
      agreeing with Martov’s resolution, made the reservation that
      they found it inadequate and disagreed with the conclusions
      drawn from it (pp. 69, 73, 83 and 86).


      After discussing the position of the Bund, the Congress passed
      on to the programme. This discussion centred mainly around
      amendments of detail which present but slight interest. The
      opposition of the anti-Iskra-ists on matters of
      principle found expression only in Comrade Martynov’s onslaught
      on the famous presentation of the question of spontaneity and
      consciousness. Martynov was, of course, backed by the Bundists
      and Rabocheye Dyelo-ists to a man. The unsoundness of
      his objections was pointed out, among others,

 

      by Martov and
      Plekhanov. It should be noted as a curiosity that the
      Iskra editorial board (on second thoughts, apparently)
      have now gone over to Martynov’s side and are saying the
      opposite of what they said at the Congress! Presumably, this is
      in accordance with the celebrated principle of
      “continuity”.... It only remains for us to wait until the
      editorial board have thoroughly cleared up the question and
      explain to us just how far they agree with Martynov, on what
      points exactly, and since when. Meanwhile, we only ask: has
      anyone ever seen a party organ whose editorial board
      said after a congress the very opposite of what they had said at
      the congress?


      Passing over the arguments about the adoption of Iskra
      as the Central Organ (we dealt with that above) and the
      beginning of the debate on the Rules (which it will be more
      convenient to examine in connection with the whole discussion of
      the Rules), let us consider the shades of principle revealed
      during the discussion of the programme. First of all let us note
      one detail of a highly characteristic nature, namely, the debate
      on proportional representation. Comrade Egorov of Yuzhny
      Rabochy advocated the inclusion of this point in the
      programme, and did so in a way that called forth the justified
      remark from Posadovsky (an Iskra-ist of the minority)
      that there was a “serious difference of opinion”. “There can be
      no doubt,” said Comrade Posadovsky, “that we do not agree on the
      following fundamental question: should we subordinate our
      future policy to certain fundamental democratic principles and
      attribute absolute value to them, or should all democratic
      principles be exclusively subordinated to the interests of our
      Party? I am decidedly in favour of the latter.” Plekhanov “fully
      associated himself” with Posadovsky, objecting in even more
      definite and emphatic terms to “the absolute value of democratic
      principles” and to regarding them
      “abstractly”. “Hypothetically,” he said, “a case is conceivable
      where we Social-Democrats would oppose universal suffrage. There
      was a time when the bourgeoisie of the Italian republics
      deprived members of the nobility of political rights. The
      revolutionary proletariat may restrict the political rights of
      the upper classes in the same way as the upper classes used to
      restrict its political rights.” Plekhanov’s speech was greeted
      with applause

 

      and hissing, and when Plekhanov protested
      against somebody’s

   Zwischenruf,[1]

“You should not hiss,” and told
      the comrades not to restrain their demonstrations, Comrade
      Egorov got up and said: “Since such speeches call forth
      applause, I am obliged to hiss.” Together with Comrade Goldblatt
      (a Bund delegate), Comrade Egorov challenged the views of
      Posadovsky and Plekhanov. Unfortunately, the debate was closed,
      and this question that had cropped up in it immediately vanished
      from the scene. But it is useless for Comrade Martov to attempt
      now to belittle or even altogether deny its significance by
      saying at the League Congress: "These words [Plekhanov’sl
      aroused the indignation of some of the delegates; this could
      easily have been avoided if Comrade Plekhanov had added that it
      was of course impossible to imagine so tragic a situation as
      that the proletariat, in order to consolidate its victory,
      should have to trample on such political rights as freedom of
      the press.... (Plekhanov: ’Merci.’)"
      (League Minutes, p. 58.) This interpretation directly
      contradicts Comrade Posadovsky’s categorical statement at
      the Congress about a “serious difference of opinion” and
      disagreement on a “fundamental question”. On this fundamental
      question, all the Iskra-ists at the Congress
      opposed the spokesmen of the anti-Iskra
      “Right” (Goldblatt) and of the Congress “Centre” (Egorov). This
      is a fact, and one may safely assert that if the “Centre” (I
      hope this word will shock the “official” supporters of mildness
      less than any other. . .) had had occasion to speak “without
      restraint” (through the mouth of Comrade Egorov or Makhov)
      on this or on analogous questions, the serious difference of
      opinion would have been revealed at once.


      It was revealed even more distinctly over the matter of
      “equality of languages” (Minutes, p. 171 et seq.). On this point
      it was not so much the debate that was so eloquent, but the
      voting: counting up the times a vote was taken, we get the
      incredible number of sixteen! Over what? Over whether
      it was enough to stipulate in the programme the equality of all
      citizens irrespective of sex, etc., and language, or
      whether it was necessary to stipulate “freedom of language”, or
      “equality of languages”. Comrade Martov characterised

 

      this
      episode fairly accurately at the League Congress when he said
      that “a trifling dispute over the formulation of one point of
      the programme became a matter of principle because half the
      Congress was prepared to overthrow the Programme
      Committee”.

Precisely.[2]
[2]
Martov added: “On this occasion much harm
was done by Plekhanov’s witticism
about asses.” (When the question of freedom of language was being discussed, a
Bundist, I think it was, mentioned stud farms among other institutions,
whereupon Plekhanov said in a loud undertone: “Horses don’t talk, but asses
sometimes do.”) I cannot, of course, see anything particularly mild,
accommodating, tactful or flexible about this witticism. But I find it strange
that Martov, who admitted that the dispute became a matter of
principle, made absolutely no attempt to analyse what this principle was
and what shades of opinion found expression here, but confined himself to
talking about the “harmfulness” of witticisms. This is indeed a bureaucratic and
formalistic attitude! It is true that “much harm was done at the Congress” by
cutting witticisms, levelled not only at the Bundists, but also at those whom
the Bundists sometimes supported and even saved from defeat. However, once you
admit that the incident involved principles, you cannot confine yourself to
phrases about the “impermissibility” (League Minutes, p. 58) of certain
witticisms. —Lenin


      The immediate
      cause of the conflict was indeed trifling, yet it did become a
      matter of principle and consequently assumed terribly
      bitter forms, even to the point of attempts to
      “overthrow” the Programme Committee, of suspecting
      people of a desire to “mislead the Congress” (as Egorov
      suspected Martov!), and of personal remarks of the most
      . . . abusive kind (p. 178). Even Comrade Popov “expressed
      regret that mere trifles had given rise to such an
      atmosphere” (my italics, p. 182) as prevailed during the
      course of three sittings (the 16th, 17th and 18th).


      All these expressions very definitely and categorically point to
      the extremely important fact that the atmosphere of “suspicion”
      and of the most bitter forms of conflict (“over
      throwing”)—for which later, at the League Congress, the
      Iskra-ist majority were held responsible!—actually
      arose long before we split into a majority and
      minority. I repeat, this is a fact of enormous importance,
      a fundamental fact, and failure to understand it leads a great
      many people to very thoughtless conclusions about the majority
      at the end of the Congress having been artificial. From the
      present point of view of Comrade Martov, who asserts that
      nine-tenths

 

      of the Congress delegates were Iskra-ists, the
      fact that “mere trifles”, a “trivial” cause, could give rise to
      a conflict which became a “matter of principle” and nearly led
      to the overthrow of a Congress commission is absolutely
      inexplicable and absurd. It would be ridiculous to evade this
      fact with lamentations and regrets about “harmful”
      witticisms. No cutting witticisms could have made the conflict a
      matter of principle; it could become that only because
      of the character of the political groupings at the Congress. It
      was not cutting remarks and witticisms that gave rise to the
      conflict—they were only a symptom of the fact that
      the Congress political grouping itself harboured a
      “contradiction”, that it harboured all the makings of a
      conflict, that it harboured an internal heterogeneity which
      burst forth with immanent force at the least cause, even the
      most trifling.


      On the other hand, from the point of view from which I regard
      the Congress, and which I deem it my duty to uphold as a
      definite political interpretation of the events, even though
      this interpretation may seem offensive to some—from this
      point of view the desperately acute conflict of
      principle that arose from a “trifling” cause is quite
      explicable and inevitable. Since a struggle between the
      Iskra-ists and the anti-Iskra-ists went on
      all the time at our Congress, since between them stood
      unstable elements, and since the latter, together with the
      anti-Iskra-ists, controlled one-third of the votes (8+10=18, out
      of 51, according to my calculation, an approximate
      one, of course), it is perfectly clear and natural that any
      falling away from the "Iskra "-ists of even a
      small minority created the possibility of a victory for the
      anti-Iskra trend and therefore evoked a “frenzied”
      struggle. This was not the result of improper cutting remarks
      and attacks, but of the political combination. It was not
      cutting remarks that gave rise to the political conflict; it was
      the existence of a political conflict in the very grouping at
      the Congress that gave rise to cutting remarks and
      attacks—this contrast expresses the cardinal disagreement
      in principle between Martov and myself in appraising the
      political significance of the Congress and its results.


      In all, there were during the Congress three major cases of a
      small number of Iskra-ists falling away from the

 

      majority—over the equality of languages question, over
      Paragraph 1 of the Rules, and over the elections—and in all
      three cases a fierce struggle ensued, finally leading to the
      severe crisis we have in the Party today. For a political
      understanding of this crisis and this struggle, we must not
      confine ourselves to phrases about the impermissibility of
      witticisms, but must examine the political grouping of the
      shades that clashed at the Congress. The “equality of languages”
      incident is therefore doubly interesting as far as ascertaining
      the causes of the divergence is concerned, for here Martov was
      (still was!) an Iskra-ist and fought the
      anti-Iskra-ists and the “Centre” harder perhaps than
      anybody else.


      The war opened with an argument between Comrade Martov and
      Comrade Lieber, the leader of the Bundists (pp. 171-72). Martov
      argued that the demand for “equality of citizens” was
      enough. “Freedom of language” was rejected, but “equality of
      languages” was forthwith proposed, and Comrade Egorov joined
      Lieber in the fray. Martov declared that it was
      fetishism “when speakers insist that nationalities are
      equal and transfer inequality to the sphere of language, whereas
      the question should be examined from just the opposite angle:
      inequality of nationalities exists, and one of its expressions
      is that people belonging to certain nations are deprived of the
      right to use their mother tongue” (p. 172). There Martov was
      absolutely right. The totally baseless attempt of Lieber and
      Egorov to insist on the correctness of their formulation and
      make out that we were unwilling or unable to uphold the
      principle of equality of nationalities was indeed a sort of
      fetishism. Actually, they were, like “fetish-worshippers”,
      defending the word and not the principle, acting not from fear
      of committing an error of principle, but from fear of what
      people might say. This shaky mentality (what if “others” blame
      us for this?)—which we already noted in connection with the
      Organising Committee incident—was quite clearly displayed
      here by our entire “Centre”. Another of its spokesmen, the
      Mining Area delegate Lvov, who stood close to Yuzhny
      Rabochy, declared that "the question of the suppression of
      languages which has been raised by the border districts is a
      very serious one. It is important to include a point on

 

      language
      in our programme and thus obviate any possibility of the
      Social-Democrats being suspected of Russifying tendencies." A
      remarkable explanation of the “seriousness” of the question. It
      is very serious because possible suspicions on the part
      of the border districts must be obviated! The speaker says
      absolutely nothing on the substance of the question, he does not
      rebut the charge of fetishism but entirely confirms it, for he
      shows a complete lack of arguments of his own and merely talks
      about what the border districts may say. Everything they
      may say will be untruehe is told. But instead
      of examining whether it is true or not, he replies: “They
      may suspect.”


Such a presentation of the question, coupled with the
      claim that it is serious and important, does indeed raise an
      issue of principle, but by no means the one the Liebers,
      Egorovs, and Lvovs would discern in it. The principle involved
      is: should we leave it to the organisations and members of the
      Party to apply the general and fundamental theses of the
      programme to their specific conditions, and to develop them for
      the purpose of such application, or are we, merely out of fear
      of suspicion, to fill the programme with petty details,
      minutiae, repetitions, and casuistry? The principle involved is:
      how can Social-Democrats discern (“suspect”) in a fight against
      casuistry an attempt to restrict elementary democratic rights
      and liberties? When are we going to wean ourselves at last from
      this fetishist worship of casuistry?—that was the thought
      that occurred to us when watching this struggle over
      “languages”.


      The grouping of the delegates in this struggle is made
      particularly clear by the abundant roll-call votes. There were
      as many as three. All the time the Iskra core was
      solidly opposed by the anti-Iskra-ists (eight votes)
      and, with very slight fluctuations, by the whole Centre (Makhov,
      Lvov, Egorov, Popov, Medvedev, Ivanov, Tsaryov, and
      Byelov—only the last two vacillated at first, now
      abstaining, now voting with us, and it was only during the third
      vote that their position became fully defined). Of the
      Iskra-ists, several fell away—chiefly the
      Caucasians (three with six votes)—and thanks to this the
      “fetishist” trend ultimately gained the upper hand. During the
      third vote, when the followers of both trends had clarified
      their position most fully,

 

      the three Caucasians, with six votes,
      broke away from the majority Iskra-ists and went over
      to the other side; two delegates—Posadovsky and
      Kostich—with two votes, fell away from the minority
      Iskra-ists. During the first two votes, the following
      had gone over to the other side or abstained: Lensky, Stepanov,
      and Gorsky of the Iskra-ist majority, and Deutsch of
      the minority.  The falling away of eight “Iskra”-ist
      votes (out of a total of thirty-three) gave
      the superiority to the coalition of the
      anti-“Iskra”-ists and the unstable elements. It
      was just this fundamental fact of the Congress grouping
      that was repeated (only with other Iskra-ists falling
      away) during the vote on Paragraph 1 of the Rules and during the
      elections. It is not surprising that those who were defeated in
      the elections now carefully close their eyes to the
      political reasons for that defeat, to the
      starting-points of that conflict of shades which
      progressively revealed the unstable and politically spineless
      elements and exposed them ever more relentlessly in the eyes of
      the Party. The equality of languages incident shows us this
      conflict all the more clearly because at that time Comrade
      Martov had not yet earned the praises and approval of Akimov and
      Makhov.

## The Agrarian Programme




Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: F. The Agrarian Programme








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



F. The Agrarian Programme

      The inconsistency of principle of the anti-Iskra-ists
      and the “Centre” was also clearly brought out by the debate on
      the agrarian programme, which took up so much time at the
      Congress (see Minutes, pp. 190-226) and raised quite a number of
      extremely interesting points. As was to be expected, the
      campaign against the programme was launched by Comrade Martynov
      (after some minor remarks by Comrades Lieber and Egorov). He
      brought out the old argument about redressing “this particular
      historical injustice”, whereby, he claimed, we were indirectly
      “sanctifying other historical injustices”, and so on. He was
      joined by Comrade Egorov, who even found that “the significance
      of this programme is unclear. Is it a programme for ourselves,
      that is, does it define our demands, or do we want to make it
      popular?” (!?!?) Comrade Lieber said he “would like to make the
      same points as Gomrade Egorov”. Comrade Makhov spoke up in

 

      his
      usual positive manner and declared that “the majority [?] of the
      speakers positively cannot understand what the programme
      submitted means and what its aims are”. The proposed programme,
      you see, “can hardly be considered a Social-Democratic agrarian
      programme”; it . . . “smacks somewhat of a game at redressing
      historical injustices”; it bears “the trace of demagogy and
      adventurism”. As a theoretical justification of this profundity
      came the caricature and over simplification so customary in
      vulgar Marxism: the Iskra-ists, we were told, “want to
      treat the peasants as something homogeneous in composition; but
      as the peasantry split up into classes long ago [?], advancing a
      single programme must inevitably render the whole programme
      demagogic and make it adventurist when put into practice”
      (p. 202). Comrade Makhov here “blurted out” the real reason why
      our agrarian programme meets with the disapproval of many
      Social-Democrats, who are prepared to “recognise” Iskra
      (as Makhov himself did) but who have absolutely failed to grasp
      its trend, its theoretical and tactical position. It was the
      vulgarisation of Marxism as applied to so complex and many-sided
      a phenomenon as the present-day system of Russian peasant
      economy, and not differences over particulars, that was and is
      responsible for the failure to understand this programme. And on
      this vulgar-Marxist standpoint the leaders of the
      anti-Iskra elements (Lieber and Martynov) and of the
      “Centre” (Egorov and Makhov) quickly found themselves in
      harmony. Comrade Egorov gave frank expression also to one of the
      characteristic features of Yuzhny Rabochy and the
      groups and circles gravitating towards it, namely, their failure
      to grasp the importance of the peasant movement, their failure
      to grasp that it was not overestimation, but, on the contrary,
      underestimation of its importance (and a lack of forces to
      utilise it) that was the weak side of our Social-Democrats at
      the time of the first famous peasant revolts. “I am far from
      sharing the infatuation of the editorial board for the peasant
      movement,” said Comrade Egorov, “an infatuation to which many
      Social Democrats have succumbed since the peasant disturbances.”
      But, unfortunately, Comrade Egorov did not take the trouble to
      give the Congress any precise idea of what this infatuation of
      the editorial board consisted in; he did

 

      not take the
      trouble to make specific reference to any of the material
      published by Iskra. Moreover, he forgot that
      all the fundamental points of our agrarian programme
      had already been developed by Iskra in its third

  issue,[1]

      that is, long before the
      peasant disturbances. Those whose “recognition” of
      Iskra was not merely verbal might well have given a
      little more attention to its theoretical and tactical
      principles!


      “No, we cannot do much among the peasants!” Comrade Egorov
      exclaimed, and he went on to indicate that this exclamation was
      not meant as a protest against any particular “infatuation”, but
      as a denial of our entire position: “It means that our slogan
      cannot compete with the slogan of the adventurists.” A most
      characteristic formulation of an unprincipled attitude, which
      reduces everything to “competition” between the slogans of
      different parties! And this was said after the speaker had
      pronounced himself “satisfied” with the theoretical
      explanations, which pointed out that we strove for lasting
      success in our agitation, undismayed by temporary failures, and
      that lasting success (as against the resounding clamour of our
      “competitors” . . . for a short time) was impossible unless the
      programme had a firm theoretical basis (p. 196). What confusion
      is disclosed by this assurance of “satisfaction” followed by a
      repetition of the vulgar precepts inherited from the old
      Economism, for which the “competition of slogans” decided
      everything—not only the agrarian question, but the entire
      programme and tactics of the economic and political struggle!
      “You will not induce the agricultural labourer,” Comrade Egorov
      said, “to fight side by side with the rich peasant for the
      cut-off lands, which to no small extent are already in this rich
      peasant’s hands.”


      There again you have the same over-simplification, undoubtedly
      akin to our opportunist Economism, which insisted that it was
      impossible to “induce” the proletarian to fight for what was to
      no small extent in the hands of the bourgeoisie and would fall
      into its hands to an even larger extent in the future. There
      again you have the vulgarisation that forgets the Russian
      peculiarities of the general

 

      capitalist relations between the
      agricultural labourer and the rich peasant. Actually, the
      cut-off lands today oppress the agricultural labourer as
      well, and he does not have to be “induced” to fight for
      emancipation from his state of servitude. It is certain
      intellectuals who have to be “induced”—induced to take a
      wider view of their tasks, induced to renounce stereotyped
      formulas when discussing specific questions, induced to take
      account of the historical situation, which complicates and
      modifies our aims. It is only the superstition that the
      muzhik is stupid—a superstition which, as Comrade
      Martov rightly remarked (p. 202), was to be detected in the
      speeches of Comrade Makhov and the other opponents of the
      agrarian programme—only this superstition explains why
      these opponents forget our agricultural labourer’s actual
      conditions of life.


      Having simplified the question into a naked contrast of worker
      and capitalist, the spokesmen of our “Centre” tried, as often
      happens, to ascribe their own narrow-mindedness to the
      muzhik. “It is precisely because I consider the
      muzhik, within the limits of his narrow class outlook,
      a clever fellow,” Comrade Makhov remarked, “that I believe he
      will stand for the petty-bourgeois ideal of seizure and
      division.” Two things are obviously confused here: the
      definition of the class outlook of the muzhik as that
      of a petty bourgeois, and the restriction, the
      reduction of this outlook to “narrow limits”. It is in this
      reduction that the mistake of the Egorovs and Makhovs lies (just
      as the mistake of the Martynovs and Akimovs lay in reducing the
      outlook of the proletarian to “narrow limits”). For both logic
      and history teach us that the petty-bourgeois class outlook may
      be more or less narrow, and more or less progressive, precisely
      because of the dual status of the petty bourgeois. And far from
      dropping our hands in despair because of the narrowness
      (“stupidity”) of the muzhik or because he is governed
      by “prejudice”, we must work unremittingly to widen his outlook
      and help his reason to triumph over his prejudice.


      The vulgar-“Marxist” view of the Russian agrarian question found
      its culmination in the concluding words of Comrade Makhov’s
      speech, in which that faithful champion of the old
      Iskra editorial board set forth his principles. It was
      not for nothing that these words were greeted with applause ...

 

      true, it was ironical applause. “I do not know, of course,
      what to call a misfortune,” said Comrade Makhov, outraged by
      Plekhanov’s statement that we were not at all alarmed by the
      movement for a General

      Redistribution,[4]
      and that we would not be
      the ones to hold back this progressive (bourgeois progressive)
      movement. "But this revolution, if it can be called such, would
      not be a revolutionary one. It would be truer to call it, not
      revolution, but reaction (laughter ), a revolution that
      was more like a riot.... Such a revolution would throw us
      back, and it would require a certain amount of time to get back
      to the position we have today. Today we have far more than
      during the French Revolution (ironical applause ), we
      have a Social-Democratic Party (laughter )...." Yes,
      a Social-Democratic Party which reasoned like Makhov, or which
      had central institutions of the Makhov persuasion, would indeed
      only deserve to be laughed at....


      Thus we see that even on the purely theoretical questions raised
      by the agrarian programme, the already familiar grouping at once
      appeared. The anti-Iskra-ists (eight votes) rushed into
      the fray on behalf of vulgar Marxism, and the leaders of the
      “Centre”, the Egorovs and Makhovs, trailed after them,
      constantly erring and straying into the same narrow outlook. It
      is quite natural, therefore, that the voting on certain points
      of the agrarian programme should have resulted in thirty and
      thirty-five votes in favour (pp. 225 and 226), that is,
      approximately the same figure as we observed in the dispute over
      the place of the Bund question on the agenda, in the Organising
      Committee incident, and in the question of shutting down
      Yuzhny Rabochy. An issue had only to arise which did
      not quite come within the already established and customary
      pattern, and which called for some independent application of
      Marx’s theory to peculiar and new (new to the Germans) social
      and economic relations, and Iskra-ists who proved equal
      to the problems only made up three-fifths of the vote, while the
      whole “Centre” turned and followed the Liebers and
      Martynovs. Yet Comrade Martov strives to gloss over this obvious
      fact, fearfully avoiding all mention of votes where the shades
      of opinion were clearly revealed!


      It is clearly evident from the debate on the agrarian programme
      that the Iskra-ists had to fight against a good

 

      two-fifths of the Congress. On this question the Caucasian
      delegates took up an absolutely correct stand—due largely,
      in all probability, to the fact that first-hand knowledge of the
      forms taken by the numerous remnants of feudalism in their
      localities kept them from the school-boyishly abstract and bare
      contrasts that satisfied the Makhovs. Martynov and Lieber,
      Makhov and Egorov were combated by Plekhanov, by Gusev (who
      declared that he had “frequently encountered such a pessimistic
      view of our work in the countryside” as Comrade Egorov’s “among
      the comrades active in Russia”), by

      Kostrov,[5] by Karsky and by

      Trotsky. The latter rightly remarked that the “well-meant
      advice” of the critics of the agrarian programme “smacked too
      much of philistinism”. It should only be said, since we
      are studying the political grouping at the Congress, that he was
      hardly correct when in this part of his speech (p. 208) he
      ranked Comrade Lange with Egorov and Makhov. Anyone who reads
      the minutes carefully will see that Lange and Gorin took quite a
      different stand from Egorov and Makhov. Lange and Gorin did not
      like the formulation of the point on the cut off lands; they
      fully understood the idea of our agrarian programme, but tried
      to apply it in a different way, worked constructively
      to find what they considered a more irreproachable formulation,
      and in submitting their motions had in view either to convince
      the authors of the programme or else to side with them against
      all the non-Iskra-ists. For example, one has only to
      compare Makhov’s motions to reject the whole agrarian programme
      (p. 212; nine for, thirty-eight against) or individual
      points in it (p. 216, etc.) with the position of Lange, who
      moved his own formulation of the point on the cut-off
      lands (p. 225), to become convinced of the radical difference
      between

   them.[2]


      Referring to the arguments which smacked of “philistinism”,
      Comrade Trotsky pointed out that “in the approaching
      revolutionary period we must link ourselves with the
      peasantry”.... “In face of this task, the scepticism and
      political ’far-sightedness’ of Makhov and Egorov are more
      harmful than any short-sightedness.” Comrade Kostich, another
      minority Iskra-ist, very aptly pointed to Comrade

 

      Makhov’s “unsureness of himself, of the stability of his
      principles”—a description that fits our “Centre” to a
      tittle. “In his pessimism Comrade Makhov is at one with Comrade
      Egorov, although they differ in shade,” Comrade Kostich
      continued. “He forgets that the Social-Democrats are already
      working among the peasantry, are already directing their
      movement as far as possible. And this pessimism narrows the
      scope of our work” (p. 210).


      To conclude our examination of the Congress discussion of the
      programme, it is worth while mentioning the brief debate on the
      subject of supporting oppositional trends. Our programme clearly
      states that the Social-Democratic Party supports “every
      oppositional and revolutionary movement directed
      against the existing social and political order in
      Russia”. One would think that this last reservation made it
      quite clear exactly which oppositional trends we
      support. Nevertheless, the different shades that long ago
      developed in our Party at once revealed themselves here
      too, difficult as it was to suppose that any “perplexity or
      misunderstanding” was still possible on a question which had
      been chewed over so thoroughly! Evidently, it was not a matter
      of misunderstandings, but of shades. Makhov, Lieber,
      and Martynov at once sounded the alarm and again proved to be in
      so “compact” a minority that Comrade Martov would most likely
      have to attribute this too to intrigue, machination, diplomacy,
      and the other nice things (see his speech at the League
      Congress) to which people resort who are incapable of
      understanding the political reasons for the formation of
      “compact” groups of both minority and majority.


      Makhov again began with a vulgar simplification of Marxism. “Our
      only revolutionary class is the proletariat,” he declared, and
      from this correct premise he forthwith drew an incorrect
      conclusion: “The rest are of no account, they are mere
      hangers-on (general laughter ).... Yes, they are
      mere hangers-on and only out to reap the benefits. I am against
      supporting them” (p. 226). Comrade Makhov’s inimitable
      formulation of his position embarrassed many (of his
      supporters), but as a matter of fact Lieber and Martynov agreed
      with him when they proposed deleting the word “oppositional” or
      restricting it by an addition: “democratic-oppositional.”
      Plekhanov quite rightly took the field against this

 

      amendment of
      Martynov’s. “We must criticise the liberals,” he said, "expose
      their half-heartedness. That is true.... But, while exposing
      the narrowness and limitations of all movements other than the
      Social-Democratic, it is our duty to explain to the proletariat
      that even a constitution which does not confer universal
      suffrage would be a step forward compared with absolutism, and
      that therefore it should not prefer the existing order to such a
      constitution." Comrades Martynov, Lieber, and Makhov would not
      agree with this and persisted in their position, which was
      attacked by Axelrod, Starover, and Trotsky and once more by
      Plekhanov. Comrade Makhov managed on this occasion to surpass
      himself. First he had said that the other classes (other than
      the proletariat) were “of no account” and that he was “against
      supporting them”. Then he condescended to admit that “while
      essentially it is reactionary, the bourgeoisie is often
      revolutionary—for example, in the struggle against
      feudalism and its survivals”. “But there are some groups,” he
      continued, going from bad to worse, “which are always [?]
      reactionary—such are the handicraftsmen.” Such were the
      gems of theory arrived at by those very leaders of our “Centre”
      who later foamed at the mouth in defence of the old editorial
      board! "Even in Western Europe, where the guild system was so
      strong, it was the handicraftsmen, like the other petty
      bourgeois of the towns, who displayed an exceptionally
      revolutionary spirit in the era of the fall of absolutism. And
      it is particularly absurd of a Russian Social-Democrat to repeat
      without reflection what our Western comrades say about the
      handicraftsmen of today, that is, of an era separated by a
      century or half a century from the fall of absolutism. To speak
      of the handicraftsmen in Russia being politically reactionary as
      compared with the bourgeoisie is merely to repeat a set phrase
      learnt by rote.


      Unfortunately, there is no record in the minutes of the number
      of votes cast for the rejected amendments of Martynov, Makhov,
      and Lieber on this question. All we can say is that, here too,
      the leaders of the anti-Iskra elements and one of the
      leaders of the

 “Centre”[3]
[3]
Another leader of this same group, the
“Centre”, Comrade Egorov, spoke on
the question of supporting the oppositional trends on a different occasion, in
connection with Axelrod’s resolution on the

 

Socialist-Revolutionaries
(p. 359). Comrade Egorov detected a “contradiction” between the demand in the
programme for support of every oppositional and revolutionary movement
and the antagonistic attitude towards both the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the liberals. In another form, and approaching the
question from a somewhat different angle, Comrade Egorov here revealed the same
narrow conception of Marxism, and the same unstable, semi-hostile attitude
towards the position of Iskra (which he had "recognised"?), as Comrades
Makhov, Lieber, and Martynov had done. —Lenin


joined forces in the already

 

      familiar grouping against the
      Iskra-ists. Summing up the whole discussion on
      the programme, one cannot help seeing that of the
      debates which were at all animated and evoked general interest
      there was not one that failed to reveal the difference
      of shades which Comrade Martov and the new Iskra
      editorial board now so carefully ignore.

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: G. The Party Rules. Comrade Martov's Draft








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



G. The Party Rules. Comrade Martov’s Draft

      From the programme, the Congress passed to the Party Rules (we
      leave out the question of the Central Organ, already touched on
      above, and the delegates’ reports, which the majority of the
      delegates were unfortunately unable to present in a satisfactory
      form). Needless to say, the question of the Rules was of
      tremendous importance to all of us. After all, Iskra
      had acted from the very outset not only as a press organ but
      also as an organisational nucleus. In an editorial in
      its fourth issue (“Where To Begin”) Iskra had put
      forward a whole plan of

       organisation,[1]
[1]
In his speech on the adoption of Iskra as the Central Organ, Comrade
Popov said, inter alia: “I recall the article ’Where To Begin’ in No. 3
or No. 4 of Iskra. Many of the comrades active in Russia found it a
tactless article; others thought this plan was fantastic, and the majority
[?—probably the majority around Comrade Popov] attributed it solely to
ambition” (p. 140). As the reader sees, it is no new thing for me to hear my
political views attributed to ambition—an explanation now being rehashed
by Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martov. —Lenin


      which it pursued
      systematically and steadily over a period of three
      years. When the Second Party Congress adopted
      Iskra as the Central Organ, two of the three points of
      the preamble of the resolution on the subject (p. 147) were
      devoted precisely to this organisational plan and to
      “Iskra’s” organisational ideas: its role in
      directing

 

      the practical work of the Party and the
      leading part it had played in the work of attaining unity. It is
      quite natural, therefore, that the work of Iskra and
      the entire work of organising the Party, the entire work of
      actually restoring the Party, could not be
      regarded as finished until definite ideas of organisation had
      been adopted by the whole Party and formally enacted. This task
      was to be performed by the Party’s Rules of Organisation.


      The principal ideas which Iskra strove to make the
      basis of the Party’s organisation amounted essentially to the
      following two: first, the idea of centralism, which defined in
      principle the method of deciding all particular and detail
      questions of organisation; second, the special function of an
      organ, a newspaper, for ideological leadership—an idea
      which took into account the temporary and special requirements
      of the Russian Social-Democratic working-class movement in the
      existing conditions of political slavery, with the
      initial base of operations for the revolutionary
      assault being set up abroad. The first idea, as the one matter
      of principle, had to pervade the entire Rules; the second, being
      a particular idea necessitated by temporary circumstances of
      place and mode of action, took the form of a seeming
      departure from centralism in the proposal to set up two
      centres, a Central Organ and a Central Committee.
      Both these principal Iskra ideas of Party organisation
      had been developed by me in the Iskra
      editorial (No. 4) “Where To

Begin”[2]

      and inWhat Is To Be

Done?[3]

      and, finally, had been explained in detail, in a form that was
      practically a finished set of Rules, inA Letter to a

       Comrade.[4]

 Actually, all that
      remained was the work of formulating the paragraphs of the
      Rules, which were to embody just those ideas if the recognition
      of Iskra was not to be merely nominal, a mere
      conventional phrase. In the preface to the new edition of my
      Letter to a Comrade I have already pointed out that a
      simple comparison of the Party Rules with that pamphlet is
      enough to establish the complete identity of the ideas of
      organisation contained in the

  two.[5]



A propos of the work of formulating Iskra’s
      ideas of organisation in the Rules, I must deal with a certain
      incident mentioned by Comrade Martov. “. . . A statement of
      fact,” said Martov at the League Congress (p. 58), "will show
      you how far my lapse into opportunism on this paragraph [i.e.,
      Paragraph 1] was unexpected by Lenin. About a month and a half
      or two months before the Congress I showed Lenin my draft, in
      which Paragraph 1 was formulated just in the way I proposed it
      at the Congress. Lenin objected to my draft on the ground that
      it was too detailed, and told me that all he liked was the idea
      of Paragraph 1—the definition of Party
      membership—which he would incorporate in his Rules with
      certain modifications, because he did not think my formulation
      was a happy one. Thus, Lenin had long been acquainted with my
      formulation, he knew my views on this subject. You thus see that
      I came to the Congress with my visor up, that I did not conceal
      my views. I warned him that I would oppose mutual co-optation,
      the principle of unanimity in cases of co-optation to the
      Central Committee and the Central Organ, and so on."


      As regards the warning about opposing mutual co-optation, we
      shall see in its proper place how matters really stood. At
      present let us deal with this “open visor” of Martov’s Rules. At
      the League Congress, recounting from memory this episode of his
      unhappy draft (which he himself withdrew at the Congress because
      it was an unhappy one, but after the Congress, with his
      characteristic consistency, again brought out into the light of
      day), Martov, as so often happens, forgot a good deal and
      therefore again got things muddled. One would have thought there
      had already been cases enough to warn him against quoting
      private conversations and relying on his memory (people
      involuntarily recall only what is to their
      advantage!)—nevertheless, for want of any other, Comrade
      Martov used unsound material. Today even Comrade Plekhanov is
      beginning to imitate him—evidently, a bad example is
      contagious.


      I could not have “liked” the “idea” of Paragraph 1 of Martov’s
      draft, for that draft contained no idea that came up at
      the Congress. His memory played him false. I have been fortunate
      enough to find Martov’s draft among my papers, and

 

      in it
      “Paragraph 1 is formulated n o t in the
      way he proposed it at the Congress”! So much for the “open
      visor”!


      Paragraph is clearly evident from this juxtaposition that there is no
      idea in Martov’s draft, but only an empty
      phrase. That Party members must work under the control and
      direction of the organs of the Party goes without
      saying; it cannot be otherwise, and only those talk
      about it who love to talk without saying anything, who love to
      drown “Rules” in a flood of verbiage and bureaucratic formulas
      (that is, formulas useless for the work and supposed to be
      useful for display). The idea of Paragraph 1 appears
      only when the question is asked: can the organs of the
      Party exercise actual direction over Party members
      who do not belong to any of the Party
      organisations? There is not even a trace of this idea in
      Comrade Martov’s draft. Consequently, I could not have been
      acquainted with the “views” of Comrade Martov “on this
      subject”, for in Comrade Martov’s draft there are no
      views on this subject. Comrade Martov’s statement of fact
      proves to be a muddle.


      About Comrade Martov, on the other hand, it does have to be said
      that from my draft “he knew my views on this subject” and did
      not protest against them, did not reject them, either on the
      editorial board, although my draft was shown to everyone two or
      three weeks before the Congress, or in talking to the delegates,
      who were acquainted only with my draft. More, even
      at the Congress, when I moved my

 

      draft

   Rules[6]
[6]
Incidentally, the Minutes Committee, in Appendix XI, has published the draft
Rules “moved at the Congress by Lenin” (p. 393). Here the Minutes
Committee has also muddled things a little. It has confused my original
draft (see present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 476-78.—Ed.), which was
shown to all the delegates (and to many before the Congress), with the draft
moved at the Congress, and published the former under the
guise of the latter. Of course, I have no objection to my drafts being
published, even in all their stages of preparation, but there was no
need to cause confusion. And confusion has been caused, for Popov and Martov
(pp. 154 and 157) criticised formulations in the draft I actually moved at the
Congress which are not in the draft published by the Minutes Committee
(cf. p. 394, Paragraphs 7 and 11). With a little more care, the mistake could
easily have been detected simply by comparing the pages I mention.
—Lenin


and defended
      them before the election of the Rules Committee,
      Comrade Martov distinctly stated: “I associate myself with
      Comrade Lenin’s conclusions. Only on two points do I
      disagree with him” (my italics)—on the mode of
      constituting the Council and on unanimous co-optation
      (p. 157). Not a word was yet said about any difference
      over Paragraph 1.


      In his pamphlet on the state of siege, Comrade Martov saw fit to
      recall his Rules once more, and in great detail. He assures us
      there that his Rules, to which, with the exception of certain
      minor particulars, he would be prepared to subscribe even now
      (February 1904—we cannot say how it will be three months
      hence), “quite clearly expressed his disapproval of hypertrophy
      of centralism” (p. iv). The reason he did not submit this draft
      to the Congress, Comrade Martov now explains, was, firstly, that
      “his Iskra training had imbued him with disdain for
      Rules” (when it suits Comrade Martov, the word Iskra
      means for him, not a narrow circle spirit, but the most
      steadfast of trends! It is a pity, however, that Comrade
      Martov’s Iskra training did not imbue him in three
      years with disdain for the anarchistic phrases by which the
      unstable mentality of the intellectual is capable of justifying
      the violation of Rules adopted by common consent). Secondly,
      that, don’t you see, he, Comrade Martov, wanted to avoid
      “introducing any dissonance into the tactics of that basic
      organisational nucleus which Iskra
      constituted”. Wonderfully consistent, isn’t it? On a question of
      principle regarding an opportunist formulation of
      Paragraph 1 or hypertrophy of centralism, Comrade Martov was so

 

      afraid of any dissonance (which is terrible only from the
      narrowest circle point of view) that he did not set forth his
      disagreement even to a nucleus like the editorial board! On the
      practical question of the composition of the central
      bodies, Comrade Martov appealed for the assistance of the Bund
      and the Rabocheye Dyelo-ist! against the vote of the
      majority of the Iskra organisation (that real basic
      organisational nucleus ). The “dissonance” in his phrases,
      which smuggle in the circle spirit in defence of the
      quasi-editorial board only to repudiate the “circle spirit” in
      the appraisal of the question by those best qualfied to
      judge—this dissonance Comrade Martov does not notice. To
      punish him, we shall quote his, draft Rules in full,
      noting for our part what views and what hypertrophy they

reveal[7]:

 

      "Draft of Party Rules.—I. Party membership.—1) A
      member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is one who,
      accepting its programme, works actively to accompish its aims
      under the control and direction of the organs of the
      Party.—2) Expulsion of a member from the Party for conduct
      incompatible with the interests of the Party shall be decided by
      the Central Committee. [The sentence of expulsion, giving the
      reasons, shall be preserved in the Party files and shall be
      communicated, on request, to every Party committee. The Central
      Committee’s decision to expel a member may be appealed against
      to the Congress on the demand of two or more committees.]" I
      shall indicate by square brackets the provisions in Martov’s
      draft which are obviously meaningless, failing to
      contan not only “ideas”, but even any definite conditions or
      requirements—like the inimitable specification in the
      “Rules” as to where exactly a sentence of expulsion is
      to be preserved, or the provision that the Central Committee’s
      decision to expel a member (and not all its decision in
      general?) may be appealed against to the Congress. This, indeed,
      is hypertrophy of verbiage, or real bureaucratic formalism,
      which frames superfluous, patently useless or red-tapist, points
      and paragraphs. “II. Local Committees.—3) In its local
      work, the Party is represented by the Party committees” (how new
      and clever!). "4) [As Party committees are recognised all those
      existing at the time of the Second Congress and represented at
      the Congress.]—5) New Party committees, in addition to
      those mentioned in Paragraph 4, shall be appointed by the
      Central Committee [which shall either endorse as a committee the
      existing membership of the given local organisation, or shall
      set up a local committee by reforming the latter].—6) The
      committees may add to their membership by means of
      co-optation.—7) The Central Committee has the right

 

      to
      augment the membership of a local committee with such numbers of
      comrades (known to it) as shall not exceed one-third of the
      total membership of the committee." A perfect sample of
      bureaucracy. Why not exceeding one-third? What is the purpose of
      this? What is the sense of this restriction which restricts
      nothing, seeing that the augmenting may be repeated
      over and over again? "8) [In the event of a local committee
      falling apart or being broken up by persecution" (does this mean
      that not all the members have been arrested?), "the Central
      Committee shall re-establish it.]" (Without regard to Paragraph
      7? Does not Comrade Martov perceive a similarity between
      Paragraph 8 and those Russian laws on orderly conduct which
      command citizens to work on weekdays and rest on holidays?) "9)
      [A regular Party Congress may instruct the Central Committee to
      reform the composition of any local committee if the activities
      of the latter are found incompatible with the interests of the
      Party. In that event the existing committee shall be deemed
      dissolved and the comrades in its area of operation exempt from

      subordination[8]

to it.]” The provision contained in this
      paragraph is as highly useful as the provision contained to this
      day in the Russian law which reads: “Drunkenness is forbidden to
      all and sundry.” "10) [The local Party committees shall direct
      all the propagandist, agitational, and organisational activities
      of the Party in their localities and shall do all in their power
      to assist the Central Committee and the Central Organs of the
      Party in carrying out the general Party tasks entrusted to
      them.]" Phew! What in the name of all that’s holy is the purpose
      of this? "11) [The internal arrangements of a local
      organisation, the mutual relations between a committee and the
      groups subordinate to it" (do you hear that, Comrade Axelrod?),
      "and the limits of the competence and autonomy" (are not the
      limits of competence the same as the limits of autonomy?) "of
      these groups shall be determined by the committee itself and
      communicated to the Central Committee and the editorial board of
      the Central Organs.]" (An omission: it is not stated where these
      communications are to be filed.) "12) [All groups subordinate to
      committees, and individual Party members, have the right to
      demand that their opinions and recommendations on any subject be
      communicated to the Central Committee of the Party and its
      Central Organs.]—13) The local Party committees shall
      contribute from their revenues to the funds of the Central
      Committee such sums as the Central Committee shall assign to
      their share.—III. Organisations for the Purpose of
      Agitation in Languages Other than Russian.—14) [For the
      purpose of carrying on agitation in any non-Russian language and
      of organising the workers among whom such agitation is carried
      on, separate organisations may be set up in places where such
      specialised agitation and the setting up of such organisations
      are deemed necessary.]—15) The question as to whether such
      a necessity exists shall be decided by the Central Committee of
      the Party, and in disputed cases by the Party Congress." The
      first

 

      part of this paragraph is superfluous in view of
      subsequent provisions in the Rules, and the second part,
      concerning disputed cases, is simply ludicrous. "16) [The local
      organisations mentioned in Paragraph 14 shall be autonomous in
      their special affairs but shall act under the control of the
      local committee and be subordinate to it, the forms of this
      control and the character of the organisational relations
      between the committee and the special organisation being
      determined by the local committee." (Well, thank God! It is now
      quite clear that this whole spate of empty words was
      superfluous.) "In respect of the general affairs of the Party,
      such organisations shall act as part of the committee
      organisation.]—17) [The local organisations mentioned in
      Paragraph 14 may form autonomous leagues for the effective
      performance of their special tasks. These leagues may have their
      own special press and administrative bodies both being under the
      direct control of the Central Committee of the Party. The Rules
      of these leagues shall be drawn up by themselves, but shall be
      subject to endorsement by the Central Committee of the
      Party.]—18) [The autonomous leagues mentioned in Paragraph
      17 may include local Party committees if, by reason of local
      conditions, these devote themselves mainly to agitation in the
      given language. Note. While forming part of the
      autonomous league, such a committee does not cease to be a
      committee of the Party.]" (This entire paragraph is extremely
      useful and wonderfully clever, the note even more so.) "19) [The
      relations of local organisations belonging to an autonomous
      league with the central bodies of that league shall be
      controlled by the local committees.]—20) [The central press
      and administrative bodies of the autonomous leagues shall stand
      in the same relation to the Central Committee of the Party as
      the local Party committees.]—IV. Central Committee and
      Press Organs of the Party.—21) [The Party as a whole shall
      be represented by its Central Committee and its press organs,
      political and theoretical.]—22) The functions of the
      Central Committee shall be: to exercise general direction of all
      the practical activities of the Party; to ensure the proper
      utilisation and allocation of all its forces; to exercise
      control over the activities of all sections of the Party, to
      supply the local organisations with literature; to organise the
      technical apparatus of the Party, to convene Party
      congresses.—23) The functions of the press organs of the
      Party shall be: to exercise ideological direction of Party life,
      to conduct propaganda for the Party programme, and to carry out
      theoretical and popular elaboration of the world outlook of
      Social-Democracy.—24) All local Party committees and
      autonomous leagues shall maintain direct communication both with
      the Central Committee of the Party and with the editorial board
      of the Party organs and shall keep them periodically informed of
      the progress of the movement and of organisational work in their
      localities.—25) The editorial board of the Party press
      organs shall be appointed at Party congresses and shall function
      until the next congress.—26) [The editorial board shall be
      autonomous in its internal affairs] and may in the interval
      between congresses augment or alter its membership, informing
      the Central Committee in each case.—27) All statements
      issued by the Central Committee or receiving its sanction shall
      on the demand of the Central Committee, be published in the
      Party

 

      organ.—28) The Central Committee, by agreement with
      the editorial board of the Party organs, shall set up special
      writers’ groups for various forms of literary work.—29) The
      Central Committee shall be appointed at Party congresses and
      shall function until the next congress. The Central Committee
      may augment its membership by means of co-optation, without
      restriction as to numbers, in each case informing the editorial
      board of the Central Organs of the Party.—V. The Party
      Organisation Abroad.—30) The Party organisation abroad
      shall carry on propaganda among Russians living abroad and
      organise the socialist elements among them. It shall be headed
      by an elected administrative body.—31) The autonomous
      leagues belonging to the Party may maintain branches abroad to
      assist in carrying out their special tasks. These branches shall
      constitute autonomous groups within the general organisation
      abroad.—VI. Party Congresses.—32) The supreme Party
      authority is the Congress.—33) [The Party Congress shall
      lay down the Programme, Rules and guiding principles of the
      activities of the Party, it shall control the work of all Party
      bodies and settle disputes arising between them.]—34) The
      right to be represented at congresses shall be enjoyed by: a)
      all local Party committees; b) the central administrative bodies
      of all the autonomous leagues belonging to the Party, c) the
      Central Committee of the Party and the editorial board of its
      Central Organs; d) the Party organisation abroad.—35)
      Mandates may be entrusted to proxies, but no delegate shall hold
      more than three valid mandates. A mandate may be divided between
      two representatives. Binding instructions are
      forbidden.—36) The Central Committee shall be empowered to
      invite to the congress in a deliberative capacity comrades whose
      presence may be useful.—37) Amendments to the Programme or
      Rules of the Party shall require a two-thirds majority; other
      questions shall be decided by a simple majority.—38) A
      congress shall be deemed properly constituted if more than half
      the Party committees existing at the time of it are
      represented.—39) Congresses shall, as far as possible, be
      convened once every two years [If for reasons beyond the control
      of the Central Committee a congress cannot be convened within
      this period, the Central Committee shall on its own
      responsibility postpone it.]"


      Any reader who, by way of an exception, has had the patience to
      read these so-called Rules to the end assuredly will not expect
      me to give special reasons for the following conclusions. First
      conclusion: the Rules suffer from almost incurable
      dropsy. Second conclusion: it is impossible to discover in these
      Rules any special shade of organisational views evincing a
      disapproval of hypertrophy of centralism. Third conclusion:
      Comrade Martov acted very wisely indeed in concealing from the
      eyes of the world (and withholding from discussion at the
      Congress) more than 38/39 of his Rules. Only it is rather odd
      that à propos of this concealment he should talk
      about an open visor.

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: H. Discussion on Centralism Prior to the Split Among the Iskra-ists








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



H. Discussion on Centralism Prior to the Split
      Among the Iskra-ists

      Before passing to the really interesting question of the
      formulation of Paragraph 1 of the Rules, a question which
      undoubtedly disclosed the existence of different shades of
      opinion, let us dwell a little on that brief general discussion
      of the Rules which occupied the 14th and part of the 15th
      Congress sittings. This discussion is of some significance
      inasmuch as it preceded the complete divergence within
      the Iskra organisation over the composition of the
      central bodies, whereas the subsequent debate on the Rules in
      general, and on co-optation in particular, took place
      after this divergence in the Iskra
      organisation. Naturally, before the divergence we were
      able to express our views more impartially, in the sense that
      they were more independent of views about the personal
      composition of the Central Committee, which became such a keen
      issue with us all. Comrade Martov, as I have already remarked,
      associated himself (p. 157) with my views on
      organisation, only making the reservation that he differed on
      two points of detail. Both the anti-Iskra-ists
      and the “Centre”, on the contrary, at once took the field
      against both fundamental ideas of the whole
      Iskra organisational plan (and, consequently, against
      the Rules in their entirety): against centralism and against
      “two centres” Comrade Lieber referred to my Rules as “organised
      distrust” and discerned decentralism in the proposal
      for two centres (as did Comrades Popov and Egorov). Comrade
      Akimov wanted to broaden the jurisdiction of the local
      committees, and, in particular, to grant them themselves “the
      right to alter their composition”. “They should be allowed
      greater freedom of action.... The local committees should be
      elected by the active workers in their localities, just as the
      Central Committee is elected by the representatives of all the
      active organisations in Russia. And if even this cannot be
      allowed, let the number of members that the Central Committee
      may appoint to local committees be limited. . .”
      (p. 158). Comrade Akimov, as you see, suggested an argument
      against “hypertrophy of centralism”, but Comrade Martov remained
      deaf to these weighty arguments, not yet having been induced by
      his defeat over the composition of the central bodies

 

      to follow
      in Akimov’s wake. He remained deaf even when Comrade Akimov
      suggested to him the " idea" of his own Rules
      (Paragraph 7—restriction of the Central Committee’s right
      to appoint members to the committees)! At that time Comrade
      Martov still did not want any “dissonance” with us, and for that
      reason tolerated a dissonance both with Comrade Akimov and with
      himself.... At that time the only opponents of “monstrous
      centralism” were those to whom Iskra’s centralism was
      clearly disadvantageous: it was opposed by Akimov,
      Lieber, and Goldblatt, followed, cautiously and
      circumspectly (so that they could always turn back), by Egorov
      (see pp. 156 and 276) and such like. At that time it was still
      clear to the vast majority of the Party that it was the
      parochial, circle interests of the Bund, Yuzhny
      Rabochy, etc., that evoked the protest against
      centralism. For that matter, now too it is clear to the majority
      of the Party that it is the circle interests of the old
      Iskra editorial board that cause it to protest against
      centralism....


      Take, for example, Comrade Goldblatt’s speech (pp. 160-61). He
      inveighs against my “monstrous” centralism and claims that it
      would lead to the “destruction” of the lower organisations, that
      it is “permeated through and through with the desire to give the
      centre unrestricted powers and the unrestricted right to
      interfere in everything”, that it allows the organisations “only
      one right—to submit without a murmur to orders from above”,
      etc. “The centre proposed by the draft would find itself in a
      vacuum, it would have no peripheral organisations around it, but
      only an amorphous mass in which its executive agents would
      move.” Why, this is exactly the kind of false
      phrase-mongering to which the Martovs and Axelrods
      proceeded to treat us after their defeat at the Congress. The
      Bund was laughed at when it fought our centralism while
      granting its own central body even more
      definite unrestricted rights (e.g., to appoint and expel
      members, and even to refuse to admit delegates to
      congresses). And when people sort things out, the howls of the
      minority will also be laughed at, for they cried out
      against centralism and against the Rules when they were in the
      minority, but lost no time in taking advantage of the Rules once
      they had managed to make themselves the majority.



      Over the question of two centres, the grouping was also clearly
      evident: all the Iskra-ists were opposed by Lieber, by
      Akimov (the first to strike up the now favourite Axelrod Martov
      tune about the Central Organ predominating over the Central
      Committee on the Council), by Popov, and by Egorov. From the
      ideas of organisation which the  old Iskra had always
      advocated (and which the Popovs and Egorovs had
      verbally approved!), the plan for two centres followed
      of itself. The policy of the old Iskra cut across the
      plans of Yuzhny Rabochy, the plans to create a parallel
      popular organ and to convert it virtually into the dominant
      organ. There lies the root of the paradox, so strange at first
      glance, that all the anti-Iskra-ists and the entire
      Marsh were in favour of one central body, that is, of
      seemingly greater centralism. Of course, there were some
      delegates (especially among the Marsh) who probably did not have
      a clear idea where the organisational plans of Yuzhny
      Rabochy would lead, and were bound to lead in the nature of
      things, but they were impelled to follow the
      anti-Iskra-ists by their very irresoluteness and
      unsureness of themselves.


      Of the speeches by Iskra-ists during this
      debate on the Rules (the one preceding the split among the
      Iskra-ists), particularly noteworthy were those of
      Comrades Martov (“association” with my ideas of organisation)
      and Trotsky. Every word of the answer the latter gave Comrades
      Akimov and Lieber exposes the utter falsity of the “minority’s”
      post-Congress conduct and theories. "The Rules, he [Comrade
      Akimov] said, do not define the jurisdiction of the Central
      Committee with enough precision. I cannot agree with him. On the
      contrary, this definition is precise and means that inasmuch as
      the Party is one whole, it must be ensured control over the
      local committees. Comrade Lieber said, borrowing my expression,
      that the Rules were ’organised distrust’. That is true. But I
      used this expression in reference to the Rules proposed by the
      Bund spokesmen, which represented organised distrust on the part
      of a section of the Party towards the whole Party. Our Rules, on
      the other hand" (at that time, before the defeat over the
      composition of the central bodies, the Rules were “ours”!),
      “represent the organised distrust of the Party towards all its
      sections, that is, control over all local, district, national,
      and other organisations”

 

      (p. 158). Yes, our Rules are
      here correctly described, and we would advise those to
      bear this more constantly in mind who are now assuring us with
      an easy conscience that it was the intriguing majority who
      conceived and introduced the system of “organised distrust” or,
      which is the same thing, the “state of siege”. One has only to
      compare this speech with the speeches at the Congress of the
      League Abroad to get a specimen of political spinelessness, a
      specimen of how the views of Martov and Co. changed depending on
      whether the matter concerned their own group of a lower order or
      someone else’s.

Paragraph One of the Rules




Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: I. Paragraph One of the Rules








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



I. Paragraph One of the Rules

      We have already cited the different formulations around which an
      interesting debate flared up at the Congress. This debate took
      up nearly two sittings and ended with two roll-call
      votes (during the entire Congress there were, if I am not
      mistaken, only eight roll-call votes, which were resorted to
      only in very important cases because of the great loss of time
      they involved). The question at issue was undoubtedly one of
      principle. The interest of the Congress in the debate was
      tremendous. All the delegates voted—a rare
      occurrence at our Congress (as at any big congress) and one that
      likewise testifies to the interest displayed by the disputants.


      What, then, was the substance of the matter in dispute? I
      already said at the Congress, and have since repeated it time
      and again, that “I by no means consider our difference [over
      Paragraph 1] so vital as to be a matter of life or death to the
      Party. We shall certainly not perish because of an unfortunate
      clause in the Rules!”

(p. 250.)[1]

Taken by
      itself, this difference, although it did reveal shades of
      principle, could never have called forth that divergence
      (actually, to speak unreservedly, that split) which took place
      after the Congress. But every little difference may
      become a big one if it is insisted on, if it is put
      into the foreground, if people set about searching for
      all the roots and branches of the difference. Every
      little difference may assume tremendous
      importance if it serves as the starting-point for a
      swing towards definite mistaken views, and if these
      mistaken

 

      views are combined, by virtue of new and additional
      divergences, with anarchistic actions which bring the
      Party to the point of a split.


      And that is just what happened in the present case. The
      comparatively slight difference over Paragraph 1 has now
      acquired tremendous importance, because it was this that started
      the swing towards the opportunist profundities and anarchistic
      phrase-mongering of the minority (especially at the League
      Congress, and subsequently in the columns of the new
      Iskra as well). It was this that marked the
      beginning of the coalition of the Iskra-ist
      minority with the anti-Iskra-ists and the Marsh, which
      assumed final and definite shape by the time of the elections,
      and without understanding which it is impossible to
      understand the major and fundamental divergence over the
      composition of the central bodies. The slight mistake of Martov
      and Axelrod over Paragraph 1 was a slight crack in our pot (as I
      put it at the League Congress). The pot could be bound tight
      with a hard knot (and not a hangman’s knot, as it was
      misunderstood by Martov, who during the League Congress was in a
      state bordering on hysteria); or all efforts could be
      directed towards widening the crack and breaking the pot in
      two. And that is what happened, thanks to the boycott and
      similar anarchistic moves of the zealous Martovites. The
      difference over Paragraph 1 played no small part in the
      elections to the central bodies, and Martov’s defeat in the
      elections led him into a “struggle over principles” with the use
      of grossly mechanical and even brawling methods (such as his
      speeches at the Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary
      Social-Democracy Abroad).


      Now, after all these happenings, the question of Paragraph 1 has
      thus assumed tremendous importance, and we must clearly
      realise both the character of the Congress groupings in the
      voting on this paragraph and—far more important
      still—the real nature of those shades of opinion
      which revealed or began to reveal themselves over Paragraph
      1. Now, after the events with which the reader is
      familiar, the question stands as follows: Did Martov’s
      formulation, which was supported by Axelrod, reflect his (or
      their) instability, vacillation, and political vagueness, as I
      expressed it at the Party Congress (p. 333), his (or their)
      deviation towards

 

      Jaurèsism and anarchism, as Plekhanov
      suggested at the League Congress (League Minutes, p. 102 and
      elsewhere)? Or did my formulation, which was supported by
      Plekhanov, reflect a wrong, bureaucratic, formalistic,
      Jack-in-office, un-Social-Democratic conception of centralism?
      Opportunism and anarchism, or bureaucracy and
      formalism?—that is the way the question stands
      now, when the little difference has become a big one. And
      when discussing the pros and cons of my formulation on their
      merits, we must bear in mind just this
      presentation of the question, which has been forced upon us all
      by the events, or, I would say if it did not sound too pompous,
      has been evolved by history.


      Let us begin the examination of these pros and cons with an
      analysis of the Congress debate. The first speech, that of
      Comrade Egorov, is interesting only for the fact that his
      attitude (non liquet, it is not yet clear to me, I do
      not yet know where the truth lies) was very characteristic of
      the attitude of many delegates, who found it difficult to grasp
      the rights and wrongs of this really new and fairly complex and
      detailed question. The next speech, that of Comrade Axelrod, at
      once made the issue one of principle. This was the first speech
      Comrade Axelrod made at the Congress on questions of principle,
      one might even say the first speech he made at all, and it can
      scarcely be claimed that his debut with the celebrated
      “professor” was particularly fortunate. “I think,” Comrade
      Axelrod said, “that we must draw a distinction between the
      concepts party and organisation. These two concepts are being
      confused here. And the confusion is dangerous.” That was the
      first argument against my formulation. Examine it more
      closely. When I say that the Party should be the sum (and not
      the mere arithmetical sum, but a complex) of

      organisations,[2]
[2]
      The word “organisation” is
      commonly employed in two senses, a broad and a narrow one. In
      the narrow sense it signifles an individual nucleus of a
      collective of people with at least a minimum degree of coherent
      form. In the broad sense it signifies the sum of such nuclei
      united into a whole. For example, the navy, the army, or the
      state is at one and the same time a sum of organisations (in the
      narrow sense of the word) and a variety of social organisation
      (in the broad sense of the word). The Department of Education is
      an organisation (in the broad sense of the word) and consists of
      a number of organisations (in the narrow sense of the
      word). Similarly, the Party is an organisation,


should
      be an organisation (in the broad sense of the word); at the
      same time, the Party should consist of a whole number of
      diversified organisations (in the narrow sense of the
      word). Therefore, when he spoke of drawing a distinction between
      the concepts party and organisation, Comrade Axelrod, firstly,
      did not take account of the difference between the broad and the
      narrow sense of the word “organisation”, and, secondly, did not
      observe that he was himself confusing organised and
      unorganised elements. —Lenin


does that mean that I “confuse”

 

      the
      concepts party and organisation? Of course not. I thereby
      express clearly and precisely my wish, my demand, that the
      Party, as the vanguard of the class, should be as
      organised as possible, that the Party should admit to
      its ranks only such elements as allow of at least a minimum
      of organisation.My opponent, on the contrary, lumps
      together in the Party organised and unorganised elements,
      those who lend themselves to direction and those who do not, the
      advanced and the incorrigibly backward—for the corrigibly
      backward can join an organisation. This confusion is
      indeed dangerous. Comrade Axelrod further cited the
      “strictly secret and centralised organisations of the past”
      (Zemlya i

      Volya[13]
      and Narodnaya

      Voly[14]):

      around them, he said, “were
      grouped a large number of people who did not belong to the
      organisation but who helped it in one way or another and who
      were regarded as Party members.... This principle should be
      even more strictly observed in the Social-Democratic
      organisation.” Here we come to one of the key points of
      the matter: is “this principle” really a Social-Democratic
      one—this principle which allows people who do not belong to
      any of the organisations of the Party, but only “help it in one
      way or another”, to call themselves Party members? And Plekhanov
      gave the only possible reply to this question when he said:
      “Axelrod was wrong in citing the seventies. At that time there
      was a well-organised and splendidly disciplined centre; around
      it there were the organisations of various categories, which it
      had created; and what remained outside these organisations was
      chaos, anarchy. The component elements of this chaos called
      themselves Party members, but this harmed rather than benefited
      the cause. We should not imitate the anarchy of the seventies,
      but avoid it.” Thus “this principle”, which Comrade Axelrod
      wanted to pass off as a Social-Democratic one, is in reality an
      anarchistic

principle. To refute this, one would have
      to show that control, direction, and discipline are
      possible outside an organisation, and that conferring the
      title of Party members on “elements of chaos” is
      necessary. The supporters of Comrade Martov’s formulation
      did not show, and could not show, either of these
      things. Comrade Axelrod took as an example “a professor who
      regards himself as a Social-Democrat and declares himself
      such”. To complete the thought contained in this example,
      Comrade Axelrod should have gone on to tell us whether the
      organised Social-Democrats themselves regard this professor as a
      Social-Democrat. By failing to raise this further question,
      Comrade Axelrod abandoned his argument half-way. After all, one
      thing or the other. Either the organised Social-Democrats regard
      the professor in question as a Social-Democrat, in which case
      why should they not enrol him in one of the Social-Democratic
      organisations? For only if the professor is thus enrolled will
      his “declaration” answer to his actions, and not be empty talk
      (as professorial declarations all too frequently are). Or the
      organised Social Democrats do not regard the professor
      as a Social-Democrat, in which case it would be absurd,
      senseless and harmful to allow him the right to bear
      the honourable and responsible title of Party member. The matter
      therefore reduces itself to the alternative: consistent
      application of the principle of organisation, or the
      sanctification of disunity and anarchy? Are we to build the
      Party on the basis of that already formed and welded core of
      Social-Democrats which brought about the Party
      Congress, for instance, and which should enlarge and multiply
      Party organisations of all kinds; or are we to content ourselves
      with the soothing phrase that all who help are
      Party members? “If we adopt Lenin’s formula,” Comrade Axelrod
      continued, “we shall be throwing overboard a section of those
      who, even if they cannot be directly admitted to an
      organisation, are nevertheless Party members.” The confusion of
      concepts of which Comrade Axelrod wanted to accuse me stands out
      here quite clearly in his own case: he already takes it for
      granted that all who help are Party members, whereas that is
      what the whole argument is about and our opponents have still to
      prove the necessity and value of such an
      interpretation. What is the meaning of the phrase “throwing over
      board”, which at first glance seems so terrible? Even if only

 

      members of organisations recognised as Party organisations are
      regarded as Party members, people who cannot “directly” join any
      Party organisation can still work in an organisation which does
      not belong to the Party but is associated with it. Consequently,
      there can be no talk of throwing anyone overboard in the sense
      of preventing them from working, from taking part in the
      movement. On the contrary, the stronger our Party organisations,
      consisting of real Social-Democrats, the less wavering
      and instability there is within the Party, the broader,
      more varied, richer, and more fruitful will be the Party’s
      influence on the elements of the working-class masses
      surrounding it and guided by it. The Party, as the vanguard of
      the working class, must not be confused, after all, with the
      entire class. And Comrade Axelrod is guilty of just this
      confusion (which is characteristic of our opportunist Economism
      in general) when he says: “First and foremost we are, of course,
      creating an organisation of the most active elements of the
      Party, an organisation of revolutionaries; but since we are the
      Party of a class, we must take care not to leave outside the
      Party ranks people who consciously, though perhaps not very
      actively, associate themselves with that Party.” Firstly, the
      active elements of the Social-Democratic working-class party
      will include not only organisations of revolutionaries, but a
      whole number of workers’ organisations recognised as
      Party organisations. Secondly, how, by what logic, does the fact
      that we are the party of a class warrant the conclusion that it
      is unnecessary to make a distinction between those who
      belong to the Party and those who associate
      themselves with it? Just the contrary: precisely because there
      are differences in degree of consciousness and degree of
      activity, a distinction must be made in degree of proximity to
      the Party. We are the party of a class, and therefore almost
      the entire class (and in times of war, in a period of civil
      war, the entire class) should act under the leadership of our
      Party, should adhere to our Party as closely as possible. But it
      would be

      Manilovism[15]

      and “tail-ism” to think that the entire class, or almost the
      entire class, can ever rise, under capitalism, to the level of
      consciousness and activity of its vanguard, of its
      Social-Democratic Party. No sensible Social-Democrat has ever
      doubted that under capitalism even the trade union

 

      organisations
      (which are more primitive and more comprehensible to the
      undeveloped sections) are incapable of embracing the entire, or
      almost the entire, working class. To forget the distinction
      between the vanguard and the whole of the masses gravitating
      towards it, to forget the vanguard’s constant duty of
      raising ever wider sections to its own advanced level,
      means simply to deceive oneself, to shut one’s eyes to the
      immensity of our tasks, and to narrow down these tasks. And it
      is just such a shutting of one’s eyes, it is just such
      forgetfulness, to obliterate the difference between those who
      associate themselves and those who belong, those who are
      conscious and active and those who only help.


      To argue that we are the party of a class in
      justification of organisational looseness, in
      justification of confusing organisation with
      disorganisation, is to repeat the mistake of Nadezhdin, who
      confused “the philosophical and social historical question of
      the ’depth’ of the ’roots’ of the movement with the technical
      and organisational question” (What Is To Be Done?,

       p. 91).[3]

It is this confusion, wrought
      by the deft hand of Comrade Axelrod, that was then repeated
      dozens of times by the speakers who defended Comrade Martov’s
      formulation. “The more widespread the title of Party member, the
      better,” said Martov, without, however, explaining the benefit
      of a widespread title which did not correspond to
      fact. Can it be denied that control over Party members who do
      not belong to a Party organisation is a mere fiction? A
      widespread fiction is not beneficial, but harmful. “We could
      only rejoice if every striker, every demonstrator, answering for
      his actions, could proclaim himself a Party member” (p. 239). Is
      that so? Every striker should have the right to
      proclaim himself a Party member? In this statement Comrade
      Martov instantly carries his mistake to the point of absurdity,
      by lowering Social-Democracy to the level of mere
      strike-making, thereby repeating the misadventures of the
      Akimovs. We could only rejoice if the Social-Democrats succeeded
      in directing every strike, for it is their plain and
      unquestionable duty to direct every manifestation of the class
      struggle of the proletariat, and strikes are one of the most
      profound and most powerful manifestations of that

 

      struggle. But
      we should be tail-enders if we were to identify this
      primary form of struggle, which ipso facto is no more
      than a trade unionist form, with the all-round and conscious
      Social Democratic struggle. We should be opportunistically
      legitimising a patent falsehood if we were to allow
      every striker the right to “proclaim himself a Party member”,
      for in the majority of cases such a “proclamation”
      would be false. We should be indulging in complacent
      daydreaming if we tried to assure ourselves and others that
      every striker can be a Social-Democrat and a
      member of the Social-Democratic Party, in face of that infinite
      disunity, oppression, and stultification which under capitalism
      is bound to weigh down upon such very wide sections of the
      “untrained”, unskilled workers. This example of the
      "striker " brings out with particular clarity the
      difference between the revolutionary striving to direct
      every strike in a Social-Democratic way and the
      opportunist phrase-mongering which proclaims every
      striker a Party member. We are the Party of a class inasmuch as
      we in fact direct almost the entire, or even the
      entire, proletarian class in a Social-Democratic way; but only
      Akimovs can conclude from this that we must in word
      identify the Party and the class.


      “I am not afraid of a conspiratorial organisation,” said Comrade
      Martov in this same speech; but, he added, “for me a
      conspiratorial organisation has meaning only when it is
      enveloped by a broad Social-Democratic working-class party”
      (p. 239). To be exact he should have said: when it is enveloped
      by a broad Social-Democratic working-class movement.
      And in that form Comrade Martov’s proposition would have been
      not only indisputable, but a plain truism. I dwell on this point
      only because subsequent speakers turned Comrade Martov’s truism
      into the very prevalent and very vulgar argument that
      Lenin wants “to confine the sum-total of Party members to the
      sum-total of conspirators”. This conclusion, which can only
      provoke a smile, was drawn both by Comrade Posadovsky and by
      Comrade Popov; and when it was taken up by

Martynov and Akimov,
      its true character of an opportunist phrase became altogether
      manifest. Today Comrade Axelrod is developing this same argument
      in the new Iskra by way of acquainting the reading
      public with the new editorial board’s new views on
      organisation.

 

      Already at the Congress, at the very first sitting
      where Paragraph 1 was discussed, I noticed that our opponents
      wanted to avail themselves of this cheap weapon, and therefore
      warned in my speech (p. 240): “It should not be imagined that
      Party organisations must consist solely of professional
      revolutionaries. We need the most diverse organisations of all
      types, ranks, and shades, beginning with extremely limited and
      secret and ending with very broad, free, lose
      Organisationen.” This is such an obvious and self-evident
      truth that I did not think it necessary to dwell on it. But
      today, when we have been dragged back in so many respects, one
      has to “repeat old lessons” on this subject too. In order to do
      so, I shall quote certain passages from What Is To Be
      Done? and A Letter to a Comrade.


      “. . . A circle of leaders of the type of Alexeyev and Myshkin,
      of Khalturin and Zhelyabov, is capable of coping with political
      tasks in the genuine and most practical sense of the term, for
      the reason and to the extent that their impassioned propaganda
      meets with response among the spontaneously awakening masses,
      and their sparkling energy is answered and supported by the
      energy of the revolutionary

       class.”[4]

      In
      order to be a Social-Democratic party, we must win the
      support precisely of the class. It is not that
      the Party should envelop the conspiratorial organisation, as
      Comrade Martov thought, but that the revolutionary class, the
      proletariat, should envelop the Party, the latter to include
      both conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial organisations.


      “. . . The workers’ organisations for the economic struggle
      should be trade union organisations. Every Social-Democratic
      worker should as far as possible assist and actively work in
      these organisations. But . . . it is certainly not in our
      interest to demand that only Social-Democrats should be eligible
      for membership in the trade unions since that would only narrow
      the scope of our influence upon the masses. Let every worker who
      understands the need to unite for the, struggle against the
      employers and the government join the trade unions. The very aim
      of the trade unions would be impossible of achievement if they
      did not unite all who have attained at least this elementary
      degree of understanding—if

 

      they were not very
      broad organisations. The broader these organisations,
      the broader will be our influence over them—an influence
      due, not only to the ’spontaneous’ development of the economic
      struggle, but to the direct and conscious effort of the
      socialist trade union members to influence their comrades”

       (p. 86).[5]

Incidentally, the example of
      the trade unions is particularly significant for an assessment
      of the controversial question of Paragraph 1. That these unions
      should work “under the control and direction” of the
      Social-Democratic organisations, of that there can be no two
      opinions among Social-Democrats. But on those grounds to
      confer on all members of trade unions the right to “proclaim
      themselves” members of the Social-Democratic Party would be an
      obvious absurdity and would constitute a double danger: on the
      one hand, of narrowing the dimensions of the trade
      union movement and thus weakening the solidarity of the workers;
      and, on the other, of opening the door of the Social-Democratic
      Party to vagueness and vacillation. The German Social-Democrats
      had occasion to solve a similar problem in a practical instance,
      in the celebrated case of the Hamburg bricklayers working on
      piece

      rates.[16]  The
      Social-Democrats did not hesitate for a moment
      to proclaim strike breaking dishonourable in Social-Democratic
      eyes, that is, to acknowledge that to direct and support strikes
      was their own vital concern; but at the same time they
      just as resolutely rejected the demand for identifying the
      interests of the Party with the interests of the trade unions,
      for making the Party responsible for individual acts of
      individual trade unions. The Party should and will strive to
      imbue the trade unions with its spirit and bring them under its
      influence; but precisely in order to do so it must distinguish
      the fully Social-Democratic elements in these unions (the
      elements belonging to the Social-Democratic Party) from those
      which are not fully class-conscious and politically active, and
      not confuse the two, as Comrade Axelrod would have us do.


      “... Centralisation of the most secret functions in an
      organisation of revolutionaries will not diminish, but rather
      increase the extent and enhance the quality of the activity

 

      of a
      large number of other organisations that are intended for a
      broad public and are therefore as loose and as non-secret as
      possible, such as workers’ trade unions; workers’ self-education
      circles and circles for reading illegal literature; and
      socialist, as well as democratic, circles among all
      other sections of the population; etc., etc. We must have such
      circles, trade unions, and organisations everywhere in as
      large a number as possible and with the widest variety of
      functions; but it would be absurd and harmful to
      confound them with the organisation of
      revolutionaries, to efface the border-line between them
      . . .”

       (p. 96).[6]

This quotation shows how out
      of place it was for Comrade Martov to remind me that the
      organisation of revolutionaries should be enveloped by
      broad organisations of workers. I had already pointed this out
      inWhat Is To Be Done?—and inA Letter to a
      Comrade I developed this idea more concretely. Factory
      circles, I wrote there, “are particularly important to us: the
      main strength of the movement lies in the organisation of the
      workers at the large factories, for the large factories
      (and mills) contain not only the predominant part of the working
      class, as regards numbers, but even more as regards influence,
      development, and fighting capacity. Every factory must be our
      fortress.... The factory subcommittee should endeavour to
      embrace the whole factory, the largest possible number of the
      workers, with a network of all kinds of circles (or
      agents).... All groups, circles, subcommittees, etc., should
      enjoy the status of committee institutions or branches of a
      committee. Some of them will openly declare their wish to join
      the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and, if
      endorsed by the committee, will join the Party, and will
      assume definite functions (on the instructions of, or in
      agreement with, the committee), will undertake to obey the
      orders of the Party organs, receive the same rights as all
      Party members, and be regarded as immediate candidates for
      membership of the committee, etc. Others will not join
      the R.S.D.L.P., and will have the status of circles formed by
      Party members, or associated with one Party group or another,
      etc.”

     (pp. 17-18).[7]

The words I have underlined make

 

      it particularly clear that the
      idea of my formulation of Paragraph 1 was already fully
      expressed in A Letter to a Comrade. The conditions for
      joining the Party are directly indicated there, namely: 1) a
      certain degree of organisation, and 2) endorsement by a Party
      committee. A page later I roughly indicate also what groups and
      organisations should (or should not) be admitted to the Party,
      and for what reasons: “The distributing groups should belong to
      the R.S.D.L.P. and know a certain number of its members and
      functionaries. The groups for studying labour conditions and
      drawing up trade union demands need not necessarily belong to
      the R.S.D.L.P. Groups of students, officers, or office employees
      engaged in self-education in conjunction with one or
      two Party members should in some cases not even be aware that
      these belong to the Party, etc.”

     (pp. 18-19).[8]


      There you have additional material on the subject of the “open
      visor”! Whereas the formula of Comrade Martov’s draft does not
      even touch on relations between the Party and the organisations,
      I pointed out nearly a year before the Congress that some
      organisations should belong to the Party, and others not. In
      A Letter to a Comrade the idea I advocated at the
      Congress was already clearly outlined. The matter might be put
      graphically in the following way. Depending on degree of
      organisation in general and of secrecy of organisation in
      particular, roughly the following categories may be
      distinguished:
1) organisations of revolutionaries;
2)
      organisations of workers, as broad and as varied as possible (I
      confine myself to the working class, taking it as self-evident
      that, under certain conditions, certain elements of other
      classes will also be included here). These two categories
      constitute the Party. Further,
3) workers’ organisations
      associated with the Party;
4) workers’ organisations not
      associated with the Party but actually under its control and
      direction;
5) unorganised elements of the working class, who in
      part also come under the direction of the Social-Democratic
      Party, at any rate during big manifestations of the class
      struggle. That, approximately, is how the matter presents itself
      to me. As Comrade Martov sees it, on the

 

      contrary, the
      border-line of the Party remains absolutely vague, for “every
      striker” can “proclaim himself a Party member”. What benefit is
      there in this looseness? A widespread “title”. Its harm is that
      it introduces a disorganising idea, the confusing of
      class and party.


      In illustration of the general propositions we have adduced, let
      us take a cursory glance at the further discussion of Paragraph
      1 at the Congress. Comrade Brouckère (to the great glee of
      Comrade Martov) pronounced in favour of my formulation, but
      his alliance with me, unlike Comrade Akimov’s with
      Martov, turned out to be based on a misunderstanding. Comrade
      Brouckère did “not agree with the Rules as a whole, with
      their entire spirit” (p. 239), and defended my formulation
      as the basis of the democracy which the supporters of
      Rabocheye Dyelo desired. Comrade Brouckère had not
      yet risen to the view that in a political struggle it is
      sometimes necessary to choose the lesser evil; Comrade
      Brouckère did not realise that it was useless to advocate
      democracy at a Congress like ours. Comrade Akimov was more
      perspicacious. He put the question quite rightly when he stated
      that “Comrades Martov and Lenin are arguing as to which
      [formulation] will best achieve their common aim” (p. 252);
      “Brouckère and I,” he continued, “want to choose the one
      which will least achieve that aim. From this angle I
      choose Martov’s formulation.” And Comrade Akimov frankly
      explained that he considered “their very aim” (that is, the aim
      of Plekhanov, Martov, and myself—the creation of a
      directing organisation of revolutionaries) to be “impracticable
      and harmful”; like Comrade

Martynov,[9]
[9]
      Comrade Martynov, it is true,
      wanted to be different from Comrade Akimov, he wanted to show
      that conspiratorial did not mean secret, that behind the two
      different words were two different concepts. What the difference
      is, neither Comrade Martynov nor Comrade Axelrod, who is now
      following in his footsteps, ever did explain. Comrade Martynov
      “acted” as if I had not—for example in What Is To Be
      Done? (as well as in the Tasks [see present
      edition, Vol. 2, pp. 323-51.—Ed.])—resolutely
      opposed “confining the political struggle to
      conspiracy”. Comrade Martynov was anxious to have his hearers
      forget that the people I had been fighting had not
      seen any necessity for an organisation of
      revolutionaries, just as Comrade Akimov did not see it now.
    —Lenin


he advocated the Economist
      idea that “an organisation of revolutionaries”

 

      was
      unnecessary. He was “confident that in the end the realities of
      life will force their way into our Party organisation, whether
      you bar their path with Martov’s formulation or with
      Lenin’s”. It would not be worth while dwelling on this
      “tail-ist” conception of the “realities of life” if we did not
      encounter it in the case of Comrade Martov too. In general,
      Comrade Martov’s second speech (p. 245) is so interesting that
      it deserves to be examined in detail.


      Comrade Martov’s first argument: control by the Party
      organisations over Party members not belonging to them “is
      practicable, inasmuch as, having assigned a function to someone,
      the committee will be able to watch over it” (p. 245). This
      thesis is remarkably characteristic, for it “betrays”, if one
      may so put it, who needs Martov’s formulation and whom
      it will serve in actual fact—free-lance
      intellectuals or workers’ groups and the worker masses. The fact
      is that there are two possible interpretations of Martov’s
      formulation: 1) that anyone who renders the Party regular
      personal assistance under the direction of one of its
      organisations is entitled to "proclaim himself "
      (Comrade Martov’s own words) a Party member; 2) that a Party
      organisation is entitled to regard as a Party member
      anyone who renders it regular personal assistance under its
      direction. It is only the first interpretation that really gives
      “every striker” the opportunity to call himself a Party member,
      and accordingly it alone immediately won the hearts of
      the Liebers, Akimovs, and Martynovs. But this interpretation is
      manifestly no more than a phrase, because it would apply to the
      entire working class, and the distinction between Party and
      class would be obliterated; control over and direction of “every
      striker” can only be spoken of “symbolically”. That is why, in
      his second speech, Comrade Martov at once slipped into the
      second interpretation (even though, be it said in parenthesis,
      it was directly rejected by the Congress when it turned
      down Kostich’s resolution—p. 255), namely, that a committee
      would assign functions and watch over their fulfilment. Such
      special assignments will never, of course, be made to the
      mass of the workers, to the thousands of
      proletarians (of whom Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martynov
      spoke)—they will frequently be given precisely to those
      professors whom Comrade

 

      Axelrod mentioned, to those
      high-school students for whom Comrade Lieber and
      Comrade Popov were so concerned (p. 241), and to the
      revolutionary youth to whom Comrade Axelrod referred in
      his second speech (p. 242). In a word, Comrade Martov’s formula
      will either remain a dead letter, an empty phrase, or it will be
      of benefit mainly and almost exclusively to “intellectuals
      who are thoroughly imbued with bourgeois individualism” and
      do not wish to join an organisation. In words, Martov’s
      formulation defends the interests of the broad strata of the
      proletariat, but in fact it serves the interests of the
      bourgeois intellectuals, who fight shy of proletarian
      discipline and organisation. No one will venture to deny that
      the intelligentsia, as a special stratum of
      modern capitalist society, is characterised, by and large,
      precisely by individualism and incapacity for
      discipline and organisation (cf., for example, Kautsky’s
      well-known articles on the intelligentsia). This, incidentally,
      is a feature which unfavourably distinguishes this social
      stratum from the proletariat; it is one of the reasons for the
      flabbiness and instability of the intellectual, which the
      proletariat so often feels; and this trait of the intelligentsia
      is intimately bound up with its customary mode of life, its mode
      of earning a livelihood, which in a great many respects
      approximates to the petty-bourgeois mode of existence
      (working in isolation or in very small groups, etc.). Nor is it
      fortuitous, lastly, that the defenders of Comrade Martov’s
      formulation were the ones who had to cite the example of
      professors and high school students! It was not champions of a
      broad proletarian struggle who, in the controversy over
      Paragraph 1, took the field against champions of a radically
      conspiratorial organisation, as Comrades Martynov and Axelrod
      thought, but the supporters of bourgeois-intellectual
      individualism who clashed with the supporters of
      proletarian organisation and discipline.


      Comrade Popov said: “Everywhere, in St. Petersburg as in
      Nikolayev or Odessa, as the representatives from these towns
      testify, there are dozens of workers who are distributing
      literature and carrying on word-of-mouth agitation but who
      cannot be members of an organisation. They can be attached to an
      organisation, but not regarded as members” (p. 241). Why they
      cannot be members of an organisation

 

      remained Comrade Popov’s
      secret. I have already quoted the passage from A Letter to a
      Comrade showing that the admission of all such workers (by
      the hundred, not the dozen) to an organisation is both possible
      and necessary, and, more over, that a great many of these
      organisations can and should belong to the Party.


      Comrade Martov’s second argument: “In Lenin’s opinion there
      should be no organisations in the Party other than Party
      organisations....” Quite true! “In my opinion, on the
      contrary, such organisations should exist. Life creates and
      breeds organisations faster than we can include them in the
      hierarchy of our militant organisation of professional
      revolutionaries....” That is untrue in two respects: 1) the
      number of effective organisations of revolutionaries that “life”
      breeds is far less than we need, than the working-class movement
      requires; 2) our Party should be a hierarchy not only of
      organisations of revolutionaries, but of a mass of workers’
      organisations as well.... "Lenin thinks that the Central
      Committee will confer the title of Party organisations only on
      such as are fully reliable in the matter of principles. But
      Comrade Brouckère understands very well that life
      [sic!] will assert itself and that the Central
      Committee, in order not to leave a multitude of organisations
      outside the Party, will have to legitimise them despite their
      not quite reliable character; that is why Comrade Brouckère
      associates himself with Lenin...." What a truly tail-ist
      conception of “life”! Of course, if the Central Committee had
      necessarily to consist of people who were not guided by
      their own opinions, but by what others might say (vide
      the Organising Committee incident), then “life” would “assert
      itself” in the sense that the most backward elements in the
      Party would gain the upper hand (as has in fact happened now
      when the backward elements have taken shape as the Party
      “minority” ). But no intelligent reason can be
      given which would induce a sensible Central Committee
      to admit “unreliable” elements to the Party. By this reference
      to “life”, which “breeds” unreliable elements, Comrade Martov
      patently revealed the opportunist character of his plan of
      organisation! . . . “I for my part think,” he continued, “that
      if such an organisation [one that is not quite reliable] is
      prepared to accept the Party programme and Party control, we may
      admit it to the Party, without

 

      thereby making it a Party
      organisation. I would consider it a great triumph for our Party
      if, for example, some union of ’independents’ were to declare
      that they accepted the views of Social-Democracy and its
      programme and were joining the Party; which does not, however,
      mean that we would include the union in the Party
      organisation....” Such is the muddle Martov’s formulation
      leads to: non-Party organisations belonging to the Party! Just
      imagine his scheme: the Party = 1) organisations of
      revolutionaries, + 2) workers’ organisations recognised as Party
      organisations, + 3) workers’ organisations not recognised as
      Party organisations (consisting principally of “independents”),
      + 4) individuals performing various functions—professors,
      high-school students, etc., + 5) “every striker”. Alongside of
      this remarkable plan one can only put the words of Comrade
      Lieber: “Our task is not only to organise an organisation [!!];
      we can and should organise a party” (p. 241). Yes, of course, we
      can and should do that, but what it requires is not meaningless
      words about “organising organisations”, but the unequivocal
      demand that Party members should work to create an
      organisation in fact. Me who talks about “organising a party”
      and yet defends using the word party to cover disorganisation
      and disunity of every kind is just indulging in empty words.


      “Our formulation,” Comrade Martov said, “expresses the desire to
      have a series of organisations between the organisation of
      revolutionaries and the masses.” It does not. This truly
      essential desire is just what Martov’s formulation does not
      express, for it does not offer an incentive to
      organise, does not contain a demand for organisation, does
      not separate organised from unorganised. All it offers is a

      title,[10]
[10]
      At the League Congress, Comrade Martov adduced one more argument
      in support of his formulation an argument that deserves to be
      laughed at. “We might point out,” he said, “that, taken
      literally Lenin’s formulation excludes the agents of the
      Central Committee from the Party, for they do not
      constitute an organisation” (p. 59). Even at the League Congress
      this argument was greeted with laughter, as the minutes
      record. Comrade Martov supposes that the “difficulty” he
      mentions can only be solved by including the Central Committee
      agents in “the organisation of the Central Committee”. But that
      is not the point. The point is, that Comrade Martov’s example
      saliently demonstrates that he completely fails to
      understand the idea of Paragraph 1;

 

it was a sheer specimen
      of pedantic criticism that did indeed deserve to be laughed
      at. Formally speaking, all that would be required would
      be to form an “organisation of Central Committee agents” pass a
      resolution to include it in the Party, and the
      “difficulty” which caused Comrade Martov so much brain-racking
      would immediately vanish. The idea of Paragraph 1 as
      formulated by me consists in the incentive to organise; it
      consists in guaranteeing actual control and
      direction. Essentially, the very question whether the
      Central Committee agents will belong to the Party is ridiculous,
      for actual control over them is fully and absolutely
      guaranteed by the very fact that they have been appointed
      agents and that they are kept on as agents. Consequently,
      here there can be no question of any confusion of organised and
      unorganised (which is the root mistake in Comrade Martov’s
      formulation). Why Comrade Martov’s formulation is no good is
      that it allows anyone, any opportunist, any windbag, any
      “professor”, and any “high-school student” to proclaim
      himself a Party member. It is in vain for Comrade Martov to
      try to talk away this Achilles heel of his formulation
      by examples in which there can be no auestion of people
      arbitrarily styling or proclaiming themselves members.
    —Lenin


and in this connection we cannot but recall

 

      Comrade Axelrod’s words: “No decree can forbid them
      [circles of revolutionary youth and the like] or individuals to
      call themselves Social-Democrats [true enough!] and even to
      regard themselves as part of the Party”—now that is not
      true at all ! It is impossible and pointless to
      forbid anyone to call himself a Social-Democrat, for in its
      direct sense this word only signifies a system of
      convictions, and not definite organisational relations. But as
      to forbidding various circles and persons to “regard themselves
      as part of the Party”, that can and should be done if these
      circles and persons injure the Party, corrupt or disorganise
      it. It would be absurd to speak of the Party as of a
      whole, as of a political entity, if it could not “by decree
      forbid” a circle to “regard itself as part” of the whole! What
      in that case would be the point of defining the procedure and
      conditions of expulsion from the Party? Comrade Axelrod reduced
      Comrade Martov’s fundamental mistake to an obvious absurdity; he
      even elevated this mistake to an opportunist theory
      when he added: “As formulated by Lenin, Paragraph 1 directly
      conflicts in principle with the very nature [!!] and aims of the
      Social-Democratic Party of the proletariat” (p. 243). This means
      nothing less than that making higher demands of the Party than
      of the class conflicts in principle with the very nature of the
      aims of the proletariat. It is not surprising that Akimov was
      heart and soul in favour of such a theory.



      It should be said in fairness that Comrade Axelrod—who now
      wants to convert this mistaken formulation, one obviously
      tending towards opportunism, into the germ of new
      views—at the Congress, on the contrary, expressed a
      readiness to “bargain”, saying: “But I observe that I am
      knocking at an open door” (I observe this in the new
      Iskra too), “because Comrade Lenin, with his peripheral
      circles which are to be regarded as part of the Party
      organisation, goes out to meet my demand.” (And not only with
      the peripheral circles, but with every kind of workers’ union:
      cf. p. 242 of the Minutes, the speech of Comrade Strakhov, and
      the passages from What Is To Be Done? and A Letter
      to a Comrade quoted above.) “There still remain the
      individuals, but here, too, we could bargain.” I replied to
      Comrade Axelrod that, generally speaking, I was not averse to
      bargaining, and I must now explain in what sense this was
      meant. As regards the individuals—all those professors,
      high-school students, etc.—I would least of all have agreed
      to make concessions; but if doubts had been aroused as to the
      workers’ organisations, I would have agreed (despite the utter
      groundlessness of such doubts, as I have proved above) to add to
      my Paragraph 1 a note to the following effect: “Workers’
      organisations which accept the Programme and Rules of the
      Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party should be included in the
      largest possible numbers among the Party organisations.”
      Strictly speaking, of course, the place for such a
      recommendation is not in the Rules, which should be confined to
      statutory definitions, but in explanatory commentaries and
      pamphlets (and I have already pointed out that I gave such
      explanations in my pamphlets long before the Rules were drawn
      up); but at least such a note would not contain even a shadow of
      wrong ideas capable of leading to disorganisation, not
      a shadow of the opportunist

      arguments[11]
[11]
      To this category of arguments, which inevitably crop up when
      attempts are made to justify Martov’s formulation belongs, in
      particular, Comrade Trotsky’s statement (pp. 248 and 346) that
      “opportunism is produced by more complex [or: is determined by
      deeper] causes than one or another clause in the Rules; it is
      brought about by the relative level of development of bourgeois
      democracy and the proletariat....” The point is not that
      clauses in the Rules may produce opportunism, but that with
      their help a more or a less trenchant weapon against opportunism
      can be forged. The deeper its causes, the more

 

trenchant should
      this weapon be. Therefore, to justify a formulation
      which opens the door to opportunism on the grounds that
      opportunism has deep causes is tail-ism of the first
      water. When Comrade Trotsky was opposed to Comrade Lieber, he
      understood that the Rules constitute the “organised distrust” of
      the whole towards the part, of the vanguard towards the backward
      contingent, but when Comrade Trotsky came to be on Comrade
      Lieber’s side, he forgot this and even began to justify the
      weakness and instability of our organisation
      of this distrust (distrust of opportunism) by talking about
      “complex causes”, the “level of development of the proletariat”,
      etc. Here is another of Comrade Trotsky’s arguments: “It is much
      easier for the intellectual youth, organised in one way or
      another, to enter themselves [my italics ] on the rolls
      of the Party.” Just so. That is why it is the formulation by
      which even unorganised elements may proclaim themselves
      Party members that suffers from intellectualist vagueness, and
      not my formulation, which obviates the right to “enter
      oneself” on the rolls. Comrade Trotsky said that if the
      Central Committee “refused to recognise” an organisation of
      opportunists, it would only be because of the character of
      certain individuals, and that since these individuals would be
      known, as political personalities, they would not be dangerous
      and could be removed by a general Party boycott. This is only

 

      true of cases when people have to be removed from the
      Party (and only half true at that, because an organised
      party removes members by a vote and not by a boycott). It is
      absolutely untrue of the far more frequent cases when
      removal would be absurd, and when all that is required
      is control. For purposes of control, the Central
      Committee might, on certain conditions, deliberately
      admit to the Party an organisation which was not quite reliable
      but which was capable of working; it might do so with the object
      of testing it, of trying to direct it on to the right
      path, of correcting its partial aberrations by guidance
      etc. This would not be dangerous if in general
      “self-entering” on the Party rolls were not allowed. It
      would often be useful for an open and responsible,
      controlled expression (and discussion) of mistaken views and
      mistaken tactics. “But if statutory definitions are to
      correspond to actual relations, Comrade Lenin’s formulation must
      be rejected,” said Comrade Trotsky, and again he spoke like an
      opportunist. Actual relations are not a dead thing, they live
      and develop. Statutory definitions may correspond to the
      progressive development of those relations, but they may also
      (if the definitions are bad ones) “correspond” to retrogression
      or stagnation. The latter case is the “case” of Comrade Martov.
    —Lenin


      and


“anarchistic conceptions” that are undoubtedly inherent
      in Comrade Martov’s formulation.


      This last expression, given by me in quotation marks, is that of
      Comrade Pavlovich, who quite justly characterised as
      anarchism the recognition of “irresponsible
      and self-enrolled Party members”. “Translated into
      simple terms,” said Comrade Pavlovich, explaining my formulation
      to comrade Lieber, “it means: ’if you want to be a Party member,
      your acceptance of organisational relations too must be not
      merely platonic’.” Simple as this “translation” was, it seems it
      was not superfluous (as events since the Congress have shown)
      not only for various dubious professors and high-school
      students, but for honest-to-goodness Party members, for people
      at the top.... With no less justice, Comrade Pavlovich
      pointed to the contradiction between Comrade Martov’s
      formulation and the indisputable precept of scientific socialism
      which Comrade Martov quoted so unhappily: “Our Party is the
      conscious spokesman of an unconscious process.” Exactly. And for
      that very reason it is wrong to want “every striker” to have the
      right to call himself a Party member, for if “every strike” were
      not only a spontaneous expression of the powerful class instinct
      and of the class struggle which is leading inevitably to the
      social revolution, but a conscious

expression of that
      process, then . . . then the general strike would not be an
      anarchist phrase, then our Party would forthwith and at once
      embrace the whole working class, and, consequently,
      would at once put an end to bourgeois society as a
      whole. If it is to be a conscious spokesman in fact, the
      Party must be able to work out organisational relations that
      will ensure a definite level of consciousness and
      systematically raise this level. “If we are to go the way of
      Martov.” Comrade Pavlovich said, “we should first of all delete
      the clause on accepting the programme, for before a
      programme can be accepted it must be mastered and
      understood.... Acceptance of the programme presupposes a
      fairly high level of political consciousness.” We shall never
      allow support of Social-Democracy,
      participation in the struggle it directs, to be
      artificially restricted by any requirements (mastery,
      understanding, etc.), for this participation itself,
      the very fact of it, promotes both consciousness and
      the instinct for organisation; but since we have joined
      together in a party to carry on systematic work, we must
      see to it that it is systematic.


      That Comrade Pavlovich’s warning regarding the programme was not
      superfluous became apparent at once, during that
      very same sitting. Comrades Akimov and Lieber, who

 

      secured
      the adoption of Comrade Martov’s

formulation,[12]
[12]
      The vote was twenty-eight for and twenty-two
      against. Of the eight anti-Iskra-ists, seven were for
      Martov and one for me. Without the aid of the opportunists,
      Comrade Martov would not have secured adoption of his
      opportunist formulation. (At the League Congress Comrade Martov
      tried very unsuccessfully to refute this undoubted fact, for
      some reason mentioning only the votes of the Bundists and
      forgetting about Comrade Akimov and his friends—or rather
      remembering them only when it could serve against me:
      Comrade Brouckère’s agreement with me.) —Lenin

at
      once betrayed their true nature by demanding (pp. 254-55)
      that in the case of the programme too only platonic acceptance,
      acceptance only of its “basic principles”, should be required
      (for “membership” in the Party). “Comrade Akimov’s proposal is
      quite logical from Comrade Martov’s standpoint,” Comrade
      Pavlovich remarked. Unfortunately, we cannot see from the
      minutes how many votes this proposal of Akimov’s
      secured—in all probability, not less than seven (five
      Bundists, Akimov, and Brouckère). And it was the withdrawal
      of seven delegates from the Congress that converted the
      “compact majority” (anti-Iskra-ists, “Centre”, and
      Martovites) which began to form over Paragraph 1 of the Rules
      into a compact minority! It was the withdrawal of seven
      delegates that resulted in the defeat of the motion to endorse
      the old editorial board—that supposed howling violation of
      “continuity” in the Iskra editorship! A curious
      seven it was that constituted the sole salvation and
      guarantee of Iskra “continuity”: the Bundists, Akimov
      and Brouckère, that is, the very delegates who voted
      against the motives for adopting Iskra as the
      Central Organ, the very delegates whose opportunism was
      acknowledged dozens of times by the Congress, and acknowledged
      in particular by Martov and Plekhanov in the matter of
      toning down Paragraph 1 in reference to the
      programme. The “continuity” of Iskra guarded by the
      anti-Iskra-ists!—this brings us to the
      starting-point of the post-Congress tragicomedy.
 
 *     *  * 

      The grouping of votes over Paragraph 1 of the Rules revealed a
      phenomenon of exactly the same type as the equality of languages
      incident: the falling away of one-quarter

 

      (approximately) of the
      Iskra majority made possible the victory of the
      anti-Iskra-ists, who were backed by the “Centre”. Of
      course, here too there were individual votes which disturbed the
      full symmetry of the picture—in so large an assembly as our
      Congress there are bound to be some “strays” who shift quite
      fortuitously from one side to the other, especially on a
      question like Paragraph 1, where the true character of the
      divergence was only beginning to emerge and many delegates had
      simply not yet found their bearings (considering that
      the question had not been discussed before hand in the
      press). Five votes fell away from the majority
      Iskra-ists (Rusov and Karsky with two votes each, and
      Lensky with one); on the other hand, they were joined by one
      anti-Iskra-ist (Brouckère) and by three from the
      Centre (Medvedev, Egorov and Tsaryov); the result was a total of
      twenty-three votes (24 - 5 + 4), one vote less than in the final
      grouping in the elections. It was the
      anti-“Iskra”-ists who gave Martov his
      majority, seven of them voting for him and one for me (of
      the “Centre” too, seven voted for Martov, and three for
      me). That coalition of the minority Iskra-ists with the
      anti-Iskra-ists and the “Centre” which formed a compact
      minority at the end of the Congress and after the Congress
      was beginning to take shape. The political error of
      Martov and Axelrod, who undoubtedly took a step towards
      opportunism and anarchistic individualism in their
      formulation of Paragraph 1, and especially in their defence of
      that formulation, was revealed at once and very clearly thanks
      to the free and open arena offered by the Congress; it was
      revealed in the fact that the least stable elements, the least
      steadfast in principle, at once employed all their forces to
      widen the fissure, the breach, that appeared in the views of the
      revolutionary Social-Democrats. Working together at the Congress
      were people who in matters of organisation frankly pursued
      different aims (see Akimov’s speech)—a
      circumstance which at once induced those who were in
      principle opposed to our organisational plan and our Rules
      to support the error of Comrades Martov and Axelrod. The
      Iskra-ists who on this question too remained faithful
      to the views of revolutionary Social-Democracy found themselves
      in the minority. This is a point of the utmost
      importance, for unless it is grasped it is absolutely
      impossible to understand either

 

      the struggle over the details of
      the Rules or the struggle over the personal composition of the
      Central Organ and the Central Committee.

[13]
Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) was a revolutionary Narodnik
      organisation formed in St. Petersburg in the autumn of 1816; erig inally
      known as the Northern Revolutionary Narodnik Group, it took the name Zemlya
      i Volya in 1878. Among the members were Mark and Olga Natanson,
      G. V. Plekhanov, 0. V. Aptekman, A. D. and A. F. Mikhailov,
      A. A. Kvyatkovsky, M. R. Popov, S. M. Kravchinsky, D. A. Kiements,
      A. D. Oboleshev, Sophia Perovskaya, and other prominent revolutionaries of
      the seventies. While not renouncing socialism as the ultimate goal, Zemlya i
      Volya put for ward as the immediate aim the satisfaction of “the
      people’s demands and desires as they are at the moment”, namely, the
      demand for “land and freedom”. “Needless to say”,
      its programme declared, “this formula can be made a reality only
through violent revolu tion”, with a view to which it advocated
      exciting “popular discon tent” and “disorganising the
      power of the state”. For the purpose of agitation among the peasantry,
      members of the orgj)anisation set up rural “colonies”, chiefly
      in the agricultural gu ernias along the Volga and in the fertile central
      regions. They also carried on agitation among the workers and the student
      youth. On Decem ber 6 (18), 1876, they organised a demonstration in the
      Kazan Square in St. Petersburg. In the course of 1878-79 Zemlya i Volyn
      published five issues of a journal of the same name.
    

      Although connected with some of the workers’ circles, Zemlya i Volya could not and
      did not want to he the leader of the working- class movement, since in
      common with other Narodniks it denied the vanguard role of the working
      class. Nor did it understand the importance of political struggle, which in
      its view only diverted the revolutionaries’ energies and might weaken their
      ties with the people.
    

      Unlike the Narodnik groups of the early seventies, Zemlya i Volya built up a
      close-knit organisation, based on principles of

 

    strict centralisation and discipline. There was a central “core”
    and around it there were territorial and specialised groups (for work among
    the peasantry and among the workers, for “disorganising”
    activities, and so on); the “core” was headed by an
    “administration” (or “commission”) which controlled the
    activities of the groups and supplied them with literature, funds, etc. The
    Zernlya i Volya Rules, adopted in the winter of 1876-77, stipulated
    subordination of minority to majority, bound every member to dedicate and
    sacrifice to the organisation’s interests “all his energies, means,
    connections, sympathies and antipathies, and even life itself”, and
    imposed absolute secrecy in regard to all the organisation’s internal
    affairs.

      By 1879, with their socialist agitation among the peasants having little
      effect and with government persecution increasing, the major ity of the
      members began to loan towards political terrorism as the principal means of
      achieving their programme. There were sharp disagreements about this, and at
      its Voronezh Congress in June 1879 Zemlya i Volya split in two: the
      adherents of the old tactics (headed by Plekhanov) formed an organisation
      called Chorny Peredel (General Redistribution), while the advocates
      of terrorism (A. I. Zhelyabov and others) founded Narodnaya Volya (People’s
      Will).
    


[14]
Narodnaya Volya (People’s Will)—the
      secret political organisa tion of the terrorist Narodniksformed in August
      1879 following the split in Zemlya i Volya. It was headed by an Executive
      Committee consisting of A. I. Zhelyabov, A. D. Mikhailov, M. F. Frolenko,
      N. A. Morozov, Vera Figner, Sophia Perovskaya, A. A. Kvyatkov sky, and
      others.


      While still adhering to the Narodnik utopian-socialist ideas, Narodnaya
      Volya believed in political struggle also, regarding the overthrow of the
      autocracy and the achievement of political freedom as a major aim. Its
      programme envisaged a “permanent popular representative body”
      elected by universal suffrage, the proclamation of democratic liberties, the
      transfer of the land to the people, and measures to put the factories in the
      hands of the work ers. “The Narodnaya Volya members,” Lenin wrote,
      “made a step forward when they took up the political struggle, but
      they failed to connect it with socialism” (see present edition,
      Vol. 8, “Working Class Democracy and Bourgeois Democracy”).
    

      Narodnaya Volya fought heroically against the tsarist autocracy. But, going
      by the erroneous theory of “active” heroes and a “pas
      sive” mass, it expected to achieve the remaking of society without the
      participation of the people, by its own efforts, through individ ual
      terrorism that would intimidate and disorganise the govern ment. After the
      assassination of Alexander II on March 1, 1881, the government was able, by
      savage reprisals, death sentences, and acts of provocation, to crush it out
      of existence.


      Repeated attempts to revive the organisation during the eighties ended in
      failure. Thus, in 1886 a group in the Narodnaya Volya tradition was formed
      by A. I. Ulyanov (elder brother of Lenin)

 

      and P. Y. Shevyryov; but after an unsuccessful attem Pt to assa si nate
      Alexander III in 1887, the group was uncovered and its active members
      executed.
    

      While criticising Narodnaya Volya’s erroneous, utopian pro gramme, Lenin
      expressed great respect for its members’ selfless struggle against
      tsarism. In A Protest by Russian Social-Demo crats (1899) he
      pointed out that “the members of the old Narodnaya Volya managed to
      play an enormous role in the history of Russia, despite the fact that only
      narrow social strata supported the few heroes, and despite the fact that it
      was by no means a revolutionary theory which served as the banner of the
      movement” (see present edition, Vol. 4, p. 181).

      instructions of the trade union centre. The Hamburg Bricklayers’ Union
      complained to the local Sociai Democratic Party organisation about the
      strike-breaking activities of the Social-Democrat members of the group. A
      court of arbitration appointed by the Central Executive of the
      Social-Democratic Party condemned the conduct of these Social-Democrats but
      turned down the proposal that they be expelled from the Party.

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: J. Innocent Victims of a False Accusation of Opportunism








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



J. Innocent Victims of a False Accusation
      of Opportunism

      Before passing on to the subsequent discussion of the Rules, it
      is necessary, in order to elucidate our difference over the
      personal composition of the central institutions, to touch on
      the private meetings of the Iskra organisation
      during the Congress. The last and most important of these four
      meetings was held just after the vote on Paragraph 1 of
      the Rulesâand thus the split in the Iskra
      organisation which took place at this meeting was in point of
      both time and logic a prelude to the subsequent struggle.


      The Iskra organisation began to hold private

meetings[1]
[1]
      I have already tried at the League Congress to give an account
      of what took place at the private meetings, keeping to the
      barest essentials in order to avoid hopeless arguments. The
      principal facts are also set out in my Letter to the Editors
      of âIskraâ (p. 4). Comrade Martov did not
      challenge them in his Reply.
    âLenin


      soon after the Organising Committee incident, which gave rise to a
      discussion of possible candidates for the Central Committee. It
      stands to reason that, since binding instructions had been
      abolished, these meetings were purely in the nature of
      consultations and their decisions were not binding on any one;
      but their importance was nevertheless immense. The, selection of
      candidates for the Central Committee was a matter of
      considerable difficulty to delegates who were acquainted neither
      with the secret names nor with the inner work of the
      Iskra organisation, the organisation that had brought
      about actual Party unity and whose leadership of the practical
      movement was one of the motives for the official adoption of
      Iskra. We have already seen that, united, the
      Iskra-ists were fully assured a big majority at the
      Congress, as much as three-fifths, and all the delegates
      realised this very well. All the Iskra-ists, in fact,
      expected the âIskraâ organisation to make definite
      recommendations as to the personal composition of the Central
      Committee,

 

      and not one member of that organisation raised any
      objection to a preliminary discussion of the Central Committee’s
      composition within it; not one of them so much as hinted at
      endorsing the entire membership of the Organising Committee that
      is converting that body into the Central Committee, or even
      at conferring with the Organising Committee as a whole
      regarding candidates for the Central Committee. This
      circumstance is also highly significant, and it is extremely
      important to bear it in mind, for now, after the
      event, the Martovites are zealously defending the
      Organising Committee, thereby only proving their political
      spinelessness for the hundredth and thousandth

time.[2]
[2]
      Just reflect on this âpicture of moralsâ: the delegate
      from the Iskra organisation confers at the
      Congress with it alone and does not hint,
      even, at conferring with the Organising Committee. But after he
      is defeated both in this organisation and at the Congress, he
      begins to regret that the Organising Committee way not
      endorsed, to extol it retrospectively, and loftily to ignore the
      organisation that gave him his mandate! It may safely be vouched
      that no analogous instance will be found in the history of any
      really Social-Democratic and really working-class party.
    âLenin


Until the
      split over the composition of the central bodies led Martov to
      join forces with the Akimovs, everyone at the Congress clearly
      realised what any impartial person may easily ascertain from the
      Congress minutes and from the entire history of Iskra,
      namely, that the Organising Committee was mainly a
      commission set up to convene the Congress, a commission
      deliberately composed of representatives of different shades,
      including even the Bundists; while the real work of
      creating the organised unity of the Party was done
      entirely by the Iskra organisation. (It should be
      remembered also that quite by chance several Iskra-ists
      on the Organising Committee were absent from the Congress,
      either because they had been arrested or for other reasons
      âbeyond their controlâ.) The members of the Iskra
      organisation present at the Congress have already been
      enumerated in Comrade Pavlovich’s pamphlet (see his Letter
      on the Second Congress,

p. 13).[9]


      The ultimate result of the heated debates in the Iskra
      organisation was the two votes I have already mentioned in my
      Letter to the Editors. The first vote: âby nine votes
      to

 

      four, with three abstentions, one of the candidates supported
      by Martov was rejected.â What could be simpler and more natural,
      one would think, than such a fact: by the common consent of all
      the sixteen Iskra organisation members at the Congress,
      the possible candidates are discussed, and one of Comrade
      Martov’s candidates is rejected by the majority (it was Comrade
      Stein, as Comrade Martov himself has now blurted
      outâState of Siege, p. 69). After all, one of the
      reasons why we assembled at the Party Congress was to discuss
      and decide to whom to entrust the âconductor’s batonââand
      it was the common duty of us all as Party members to give this
      item on the agenda the most serious attention, to decide this
      question from the standpoint of the interests of the
      work, and not of âphilistine sentimentalityâ, as Comrade
      Rusov quite rightly expressed it later. Of course, in discussing
      candidates at the Congress, we were bound to touch upon
      certain personal qualities, were bound to express our approval
      or

disapproval,[3]
[3]
      Comrade Martov bitterly complained at the League of the
      vehemence of my disapproval, failing to see that his complaint
      turned into an argument against himself. Lenin behavedâto
      use his own expressionâfrenziedly (League Minutes,
      p. 63). That is so. He banged the door. True. His conduct (at
      the second or third meeting of the Iskra organisation)
      aroused the indignation of the members who remained at the
      meeting. It did. But what follows? Only that my arguments on the
      substance of the questions in dispute were convincing and were
      borne out by the course of the Congress. For if, in fact, nine
      of the sixteen members of the Iskra organisation in the
      end sided with me, clearly this was so notwithstanding
      and in spite of my reprehensible vehemence. Hence, had
      it not been for this âvehemenceâ, perhaps even more than nine
      would have sided with me. The more âindignationâ my arguments
      and facts had to overcome, the more convincing they must have
      been.
    âLenin


especially at an unofficial and intimate
      meeting. And I have already pointed out at the League
      Congress that it is absurd to think that a candidate is
      âdisgracedâ when he is not approved (League Minutes, p. 49),
      absurd to make a âsceneâ and go into hysterics over what forms
      part of a Party member’s direct duty to select officials
      conscientiously and judiciously. And yet this was what put the
      fat in the fire as far as our minority are concerned, and they
      began after the Congress to clamour about âdestroying
      reputationsâ (League Minutes, p. 70) and to assure the broad
      public in print that Comrade Stein had been the

 

      âchief
      figureâ on the former Organising Committee and that he had been
      groundlessly accused of âdiabolical schemesâ (State of
      Siege, p. 69). Is it not hysterics to shout about
      âdestroying reputationsâ in connection with the approval or
      disapproval of candidates? Is it not squabbling when people who
      have been defeated both at a private meeting of the
      Iskra organisation and at the official supreme assembly
      of the Party, the Congress, begin to complain to all and sundry
      and recommend rejected candidates to the worthy public as âchief
      figuresâ, and when they then try to force their candidates upon
      the Party by causing a split and demanding co-optation?
      In our musty émigré atmosphere political concepts have
      become so confused that Comrade Martov is no longer able to
      distinguish Party duty from personal and circle allegiance! It
      is bureaucracy and formalism, we are to believe, to think it
      proper to discuss and decide upon candidates only at
      congresses, where delegates assemble primarily for the
      discussion of important questions of principle, where
      representatives of the movement assemble who are able to treat
      the question of personalities impartially, and who are able (and
      in duty bound) to demand and gather all necessary
      information about the candidates before casting their decisive
      votes, and where the assignment of a certain place to arguments
      over the conductor’s baton is natural and essential. Instead of
      this bureaucratic and formal view, new usages and customs have
      now become the thing: we are, after congresses, to talk right
      and left about the political burial of Ivan Ivanovich or the
      destroyed reputation of Ivan Nikiforovich; writers are to
      recommend candidates in pamphlets, the while beating their
      breasts and hypocritically asserting: âThis is not a circle, it
      is a party....â Those of the reading public who have a taste
      for scandal will eagerly savour the sensational news that, on
      the assurance of Martov

himself,[4]

so-and-so

 

      was the chief
      figure on the Organising Committee. This reading public is far
      more competent to discuss and decide the question than
      formalistic institutions like congresses, with their grossly
      mechanical decisions by majority vote.... Yes, there are
      still veritable Augean stables of émigré squabbling
      for our real Party workers to clean up!



      Second vote of the Iskra organisation: âby ten votes to
      two, with four abstentions, a list of five [candidates for the
      Central Committee] was adopted which, on my proposal, included
      one leader of the non-Iskra-ist elements and one leader
      of the Iskra-ist

minority.â[5]

 This vote is of
      the utmost importance, for it clearly and irrefutably proves the
      utter falsity of the fables which were built up later, in the
      atmosphere of squabbling, to the effect that we wanted to eject
      the non-Iskra-ists from the Party or set them aside,
      that what the majority did was to pick candidates from only one
      half of the Congress and have them elected by that half,
      etc. All this is sheer falsehood. The vote I have cited shows
      that we did not exclude the non-Iskra-ists even from the Central
      Committee, let alone the Party, and that we allowed our
      opponents a very substantial minority. The whole point
      is that they wanted to have a majority, and when this
      modest wish was not gratified, they started a row and
      refused to be represented on the central bodies at all. That
      such was the case, Comrade Martov’s assertions at the League
      notwithstanding, is shown by the following letter which
      the minority of the Iskra organisation addressed to us,
      the majority of the Iskra-ists (and the majority at the
      Congress after the withdrawal of the seven), shortly after the
      Congress adopted Paragraph 1 of the Rules (it should be noted
      that the Iskra organisation meeting I have been
      speaking of was the last: after it, the organisation
      actually broke up and each side tried to convince the
      other Congress delegates that it was in the right).


      Here is the text of the letter:
    



      âHaving heard the explanation of delegates Sorokin and

      Sablina[10]
      regarding the wish of the majority of the editorial board and
      the Emancipation of Labour group to attend the meeting [on such
      and such a

date],[6]

and having with the help of these
      delegates established that at the previous meeting a list of
      Central Committee candidates was read which was supposed to have
      come from us, and which was used to misrepresent our whole
      political position; and bearing in mind also that,
      firstly, this list was attributed to us without any attempt to
      ascertain its real origin; that, secondly, this circumstance is
      undoubtedly connected with the accusation of opportunism openly
      circulated against the majority of the Iskra  editorial
      board and of the Emancipation of Labour group, and that,
      thirdly, this accusation is, as is perfectly clear to us,
      connected with a quite definite plan to change the
      composition of the ’ Iskra’ editorial
      boardâwe consider that the explanation given us of the
      reasons for excluding us from the meeting is unsatisfactory, and
      that the refusal to admit us to the meeting is proof of not
      wanting to give us the opportunity to refute the above mentioned
      false accusations.


      âAs to the possibility of our reaching agreement on a joint list
      of candidates for the Central Committee, we declare that the
      only list we can accept as the basis for agreement is: Popov,
      Trotsky, and Glebov. Furthermore, we emphasise that this is a
      compromise list, since the inclusion of Comrade Glebov
      is to be viewed only as a concession to the wishes of the
      majority; for now that the role he has played at the Congress is
      clear to us, we do not consider Comrade Glebov a person
      satisfying the requirements that should be made of a candidate
      for the Central Committee.


      âAt the same time, we stress that our entering into negotiations
      regarding the candidates for the Central Committee has no
      bearing whatever on the question of the composition of the
      editorial board of the Central Organ, as on this question (the
      composition of the editorial board) we are not prepared to enter
      into any negotiations.
    

      âOn behalf of the Comrades,
    

      âMartov and Staroverâ
    



      This letter, which accurately reproduces the frame of mind of
      the disputing sides and the state of the dispute, takes us at
      once to the âheartâ of the incipient split and reveals its real
      causes. The minority of the Iskra organisation, having
      refused to agree with the majority and preferred freedom of
      agitation at the Congress (to which they were, of course, fully
      entitled), nevertheless tried to induce the âdelegatesâ of the
      majority to admit them to their private meeting! Naturally, this
      amusing demand only met with a smile and a shrug at our meeting
      (where the letter was of course read), and the outcry, bordering
      on hysterics, about âfalse accusations of opportunismâ evoked
      outright laughter. But let us first examine Martov’s and
      Starover’s bitter complaints point by point.


      The list had been wrongly attributed to them; their political
      position was being misrepresented.âBut, as Martov himself
      has admitted (League Minutes, p. 64), it never occurred to me to
      doubt the truth of his statement that he was not the author of
      the list. In general, the authorship of the list has nothing to
      do with the case, and whether the list was drawn up by some
      Iskra-ist or by some representative of the âCentreâ,
      etc., is of absolutely no importance. The important thing is
      that this list, which consisted entirely of members of the
      present minority, circulated at the Congress, if only as a mere
      guess or conjecture. Lastly, the most important thing of
      all is that at the Congress Comrade Martov was
      obliged to dissociate himself with the utmost vehemence
      from such a list, a list which he now would be
      bound to greet with delight. Nothing could more saliently
      exemplify instability in the evaluation of people and shades
      than this right-about-face in the course of a couple of months
      from howling about âdefamatory rumoursâ to forcing on the Party
      central body the very candidates who figure in this supposedly
      defamatory

list![7]


      This list, Comrade Martov said at the League Congress,
      âpolitically implied a coalition between us and Yuzhny
      Rabochy, on the one hand, and the Bund, on the other, a

 

      coalition in the sense of a direct agreementâ
      (p. 64). That is not true, for, firstly, the Bund would never
      have entered into an âagreementâ about a list which did not
      include a single Bundist; and, secondly, there was and could
      have been no question of a direct agreement (which was what
      Martov thought disgraceful) even with the Yuzhny
      Rabochy group, let alone the Bund. It was not an agreement
      but a coalition that was in question; not that Comrade Martov
      had made a deal, but that he was bound to have the
      support of those very anti-Iskra-ists and unstable
      elements whom he had fought during the first half of the
      Congress and who had seized upon his error over Paragraph 1 of
      the Rules. The letter I have quoted proves incontrovertibly that
      the root of the âgrievanceâ lay in the open,
      and moreover false, accusation of opportunism.
      This âaccusationâ which put the fat in the fire, and which
      Comrade Martov now so carefully steers clear of, in
      spite of my reminder in the Letter to the Editors, was
      twofold. Firstly, during the discussion of Paragraph 1 of the
      Rules Plekhanov bluntly declared that Paragraph 1 was a question
      of âkeeping awayâ from us âevery kind of representative of
      opportunismâ, and that my draft, as a bulwark against their
      invading the Party, âshould, if only for that reason, receive
      the votes of all enemies of opportunismâ (Congress Minutes,
      p. 246). These vigorous words, even though I softened them down
      a little

(p. 250),[8]

caused a
      sensation, which was clearly expressed in the speeches of
      Comrades Rusov (p. 247), Trotsky (p. 248), and Akimov
      (p. 253). In the âlobbyâ of our âparliamentâ, Plekhanov’s thesis
      was keenly commented on and varied in a thousand ways in endless
      arguments over Paragraph 1. But instead of defending their case
      on its merits, our dear comrades assumed a ludicrous air of
      injury and even went to the length of complaining in writing
      about a âfalse accusation of opportunismâ!


      Their narrow circle mentality and astonishing immaturity as
      Party members, which cannot stand the fresh breeze of open
      controversy in the presence of all, is here clearly revealed. It
      is the mentality so familiar to the Russian, as expressed in the
      old saying: either coats off, or let’s have

 

      your hand! These
      people are so accustomed to the bell-jar seclusion of an
      intimate and snug little circle that they almost fainted as soon
      as a person spoke up in a free and open arena on his own
      responsibility. Accusations of opportunism!âagainst whom?
      Against the Emancipation of Labour group, and its majority at
      thatâcan you imagine anything more terrible? Either split
      the Party on account of this ineffaceable insult, or hush up
      this âdomestic unpleasantnessâ by restoring the âcontinuityâ of
      the bell-jarâthis alternative is already pretty clearly
      indicated in the letter we are examining. Intellectualist
      individualism and the circle mentality had come into conflict
      with the requirement of open speaking before the Party. Can you
      imagine such an absurdity, such a squabble, such a complaint
      about âfalse accusations of opportunismâ in the German
      party? There, proletarian organisation and discipline weaned
      them from such intellectualist flabbiness long ago. Nobody has
      anything but the profoundest respect for Liebknecht, let us say;
      but how they would have laughed over there at complaints that he
      (together with Bebel) was âopenly accused of opportunismâ at the
      1895 Congress, when, on the agrarian question, he found himself
      in the bad company of the notorious opportunist Vollmar and his
      friends. Liebknecht’s name is inseparably bound up with the
      history of the German working-class movement not, of course,
      because he happened to stray into opportunism on such a
      comparatively minor and specific question, but in spite of
      it. And similarly, in spite of all the acrimony of the struggle,
      the name of Comrade Axelrod, say, inspires respect in every
      Russian Social-Democrat, and always will; but not because
      Comrade Axelrod happened to defend an opportunist idea at the
      Second Congress of our Party, happened to dig out old
      anarchistic rubbish at the Second Congress of the League, but in
      spite of it. Only the most hidebound circle mentality, with its
      logic of âeither coats off, or let’s have your handâ, could give
      rise to hysterics, squabbles, and a Party split because of a
      âfalse accusation of opportunism against the majority of the
      Emancipation of Labour groupâ.


      The other element of this terrible accusation is intimately
      connected with the preceding (Comrade Martov tried in vain at
      the League Congress [p. 63] to evade and hush up


one
      side of this incident). It relates in fact to that
      coalition of the anti-Iskra-ist and wavering
      elements with Comrade Martov which began to emerge in
      connection with Paragraph 1 of the Rules. Naturally, there was
      no agreement, direct or indirect, between Comrade Martov and the
      anti-Iskra-ists, nor could there have been, and nobody
      suspected him of it: it only seemed so to him in his fright. But
      politically his error was revealed in the fact that
      people who undoubtedly gravitated towards opportunism began to
      form around him an ever more solid and âcompactâ majority (which
      has now become a minority only because of the
      âaccidentalâ withdrawal of seven-delegates). We pointed to this
      âcoalitionâ, also openly, of course, immediately after
      the matter of Paragraph 1âboth at the Congress (see Comrade
      Pavlovich’s remark already quoted: Congress Minutes, p. 255) and
      in the Iskra organisation (Plekhanov, as I recall,
      pointed to it in particular). It is literally the same point and
      the same jibe as was addressed by Clara Zetkin to Bebel and
      Liebknecht in 1895, when she said: "Es tut mir in der Seele
      weh, dass ich dich in der Gesellschaft seh ’" (âIt cuts me
      to the quick to see you [i.e., Bebel] in such company [i.e., of
      Vollmar and Co.]â). It is strange, to be sure, that Bebel and
      Liebknecht did not send a hysterical message to Kautsky and
      Zetkin complaining of a false accusation of opportunism....


      As to the list of candidates for the Central Committee, this
      letter shows that Comrade Martov was mistaken in declaring at
      the League that the refusal to come to an agreement with us was
      not yet finalâanother example of how unwise it is in a
      political struggle to attempt to reproduce the spoken
      word from memory, instead of relying on
      documents. Actually, the âminorityâ were so modest as to present
      the âmajorityâ with an ultimatum: take two from the âminorityâ
      and one (by way of compromise and only as a concession,
      properly speaking!) from the âmajorityâ. This is monstrous, but
      it is a fact. And this fact clearly shows how absurd are the
      fables now being spread to the effect that the âmajorityâ picked
      representatives of only one half of the Congress and got them
      elected by that one half. Just the opposite: the
      Martovites offered us one out of three only as a concession,
      consequently, in the event of our not agreeing

 

      to this unique
      âconcessionâ, they wanted to get all the seats filled
      by their own candidates! At our private meeting we had a good
      laugh at the Martovites’ modesty and drew up a list of our own:
      Glebov-Travinsky (subsequently elected to the Central
      Committee)-Popov. For the latter we then substituted
      (also at a private meeting of the twenty-four) Comrade Vasilyev
      (subsequently elected to the Central Committee) only
      because Comrade Popov refused, first in private
      conversation and then openly at the Congress (p. 338), to be
      included in our list.


That is how matters really stood.


      The modest âminorityâ modestly wished to be in the
      majority. When this modest wish was not met, the âminorityâ were
      pleased to decline altogether and to start a row. Yet there are
      people who now talk pontifically about the âintransigenceâ of
      the âmajorityâ!


      Entering the fray in the arena of free agitation at the
      Congress, the âminorityâ presented the âmajorityâ with amusing
      ultimatums. Having suffered defeat, our heroes burst into
      tears and began to cry out about a state of siege.
      Voilà tout.


      The terrible accusation that we intended to change the
      composition of the editorial board was also greeted with a smile
      (at our private meeting of the twenty-four): from the very
      beginning of the Congress, and even before the Congress,
      everybody had known perfectly well of the plan to
      reconstitute the editorial board by electing an initial
      trio (I shall speak of this in greater detail when I come to the
      election of the editorial board at the Congress). That the
      âminorityâ took fright at this plan after they saw its
      correctness splendidly confirmed by their coalition with the
      anti-Iskra-ists did not surprise usâit was quite
      natural. Of course, we could not take seriously the proposal
      that we should of our own free will, without a fight at the
      Congress, convert ourselves into a minority; nor could we take
      seriously this whole letter, the authors of which had reached
      such an incredible state of exasperation as to speak of âfalse
      accusations of opportunismâ. We confidently hoped that their
      sense of Party duty would very soon get the better of the
      natural desire to âvent their spleenâ.

      I, too, like Martov, tried in the
      Iskra organisation to get a certain candidate
      nominated to the Central Committee and failed, a candidate of
      whose splendid reputation before and at the beginning of the
      Congress, as borne out by outstanding facts, I too could
      speak. But it has never entered my head. This comrade has
      sufficient self-respect not to allow anybody, after the
      Congress, to nominate him in print or to complain about
      political burials, destroyed reputations, etc.

      According to my reckoning, the date mentioned in the letter was
      a Tuesday. The meeting took place on Tuesday evening, that is,
      after the 28th sitting of the Congress. This
      chronological point is very important. It is a documentary
      refutation of Comrade Martov’s opinion that we parted
      company over the organisation of the central bodies, and not
      over their personal composition. It is documentary
      proof of the correctness of my statement of the case at the
      League Congress and in the Letter to the Editors.
      After the 28th sitting of the Congress Comrades Martov
      and Starover had a great deal to say about a false accusation of
      opportunism, but did not say a word about the
      differences over the composition of the Council or over
      co-optation to the central bodies (which we argued about at the
      25th, 26th, and 27th sittings).

 Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: L. Conclusion of the Debate On The Rules. Co-Optation To The Central Bodies. Withdrawal of the Rabocheye Dyelo Delegates




 


Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)

L. Conclusion of the Debate On The Rules.  Co-Optation To The Central Bodies. Withdrawal of the Rabocheye Dyelo Delegates  Of the subsequent debate on the Rules (26th sitting of the Congress), only the question of restricting the powers of the Central Committee is worth mentioning, for it throws light     on the character of the attacks the Martovites are now making on hypercentralism. Comrades Egorov and Popov strove for the restriction of centralism with rather more conviction, irrespective of their own candidature or that of those they supported. When the question was still in the Rules Commission, they moved that the right of the Central Committee to dissolve local committees be made contingent on the consent of the Council and, in addition, be limited to cases specially enumerated (p. 272, note 1). This was opposed by three members of the Rules Commission (Glebov, Martov, and myself), and at the Congress Comrade Martov upheld our view (p. 273) and answered Egorov and Popov by saying that "the Central Committee would in any case deliberate before deciding on so serious a step as the dissolution of an organisation". As you see, at that time Comrade Martov still turned a deaf ear to every anti-centralist scheme, and the Congress rejected the proposal of Egorov and Popov—only unfortunately the minutes do not tell us by how many votes. 
 At the Party Congress, Comrade Martov was also "against substituting the word ’endorses’ for the word ’organises’ [the Central Committee organises committees, etc.—Paragraph 6 of the Party Rules]. It must be given the right to organise as well." That is what Comrade Martov said then, not having yet hit on the wonderful idea that the concept "organise" does not include endorsement, which he discovered only at the League Congress. 
 Apart from these two points, the debate over Paragraphs 5-11 of the Rules (Minutes, pp. 273-76) is hardly of any interest, being confined to quite minor arguments over details. Then came Paragraph 12—the question of co-optation to all Party bodies in general and to the central bodies in particular. The commission proposed raising the majority required for co-optation from two-thirds to four-fifths. Glebov, who presented its report, moved that decisions to co-opt to the Central Committee must be unanimous. Comrade Egorov, while acknowledging dissonances undesirable, stood for a simple majority in the absence of a reasoned veto. Comrade Popov agreed neither with the commission nor with Comrade Egorov and demanded either a simple majority (without the right of veto) or unanimity. Comrade Martov     agreed neither with the commission, nor with Glebov, nor with Egorov, nor with Popov, declaring against unanimity, against four-fifths (in favour of two-thirds), and against "mutual co-optation ", that is, the right of the editorial board of the Central Organ to protest a co-optation to the Central Committee and vice versa ("the right of mutual control over co-optation"). 
 As the reader sees, the groupings were highly variegated and the differences so numerous as almost to lend "uniqueness" to the views of each delegate! 
 Comrade Martov said: "I admit the psychological impossibility of working with unpleasant persons. But it is also important for our organisation to be virile and effectual.... The right of the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ to mutual control in cases of co-optation is unnecessary. It is not because I think that one is not competent in the sphere of the other that I am against it. No! The editorial board of the Central Organ, for instance, might give the Central Committee sound advice as to whether Mr. Nadezhdin, say, should be admitted to the Central Committee. I object because I do not want to create mutually exasperating red tape." 
 I objected: "There are two questions here. The first is that of the required majority, and I am against lowering it from four-fifths to two-thirds. The stipulation for a reasoned protest is not expedient, and I am against it. Incomparably more important is the second question, the right of the Central Committee and the Central Organ to mutual control over co-optation. The mutual consent of the two central bodies is an essential condition for harmony. What is involved here is a possible rupture between the two central bodies. Whoever does not want a split should be concerned to safeguard harmony. We know from the history of the Party that there have been people who caused splits. It is a question of principle, a very important question, one on which the whole future of the Party may depend" (pp. 276-77). That is the full text of the summary of my speech as recorded at the Congress, a speech to which Comrade Martov attaches particularly serious importance. Unfortunately, although attaching serious importance to it, he did not take the trouble to consider it in connection with the whole debate     and the whole political situation at the Congress at the moment it was made. 
 The first question that arises is why, in my original draft (see p. 394,      Paragraph 11),[1]  I stipulated a majority of only two-thirds and did not demand mutual control over co optation to the central bodies. Comrade Trotsky, who spoke after me (p. 277), did in fact at once raise this question. 
 The answer to it is given in my speech at the League Congress and in Comrade Pavlovich’s letter on the Second Congress. Paragraph 1 of the Rules "broke the pot" and it had to be bound tight with a "double knot"—I said at the League Congress. That meant, firstly, that on a purely theoretical question Martov had proved to be an opportunist, and his mistake had been upheld by Lieber and Akimov. It meant, secondly, that the coalition of the Martovites (that is, an insignificant minority of the Iskra-ists) with the anti-Iskra-ists ensured them a majority at the Congress in the voting on the personal composition of the central bodies. And it was about the personal composition of the central bodies that I was speaking here, emphasising the need for harmony and warning against "people who cause splits". This warning was indeed of important significance in principle, for the Iskra organisation (which was undoubtedly best qualified to judge about the personal composition of the central bodies, having as it did the closest practical acquaintance with all affairs and with all the candidates) had already made its recommendations on this subject and had taken the decision we know regarding the candidates who aroused its misgivings. Both morally and on its merits (that is, its competence to judge), the Iskra organisation should have had the decisive say in this delicate matter. But formally speaking, of course, Comrade Martov had every right to appeal to the Liebers and Akimovs against the majority of the Iskra organisation. And in his brilliant speech on Paragraph 1, Comrade Akimov had said with remarkable explicitness and sagacity that whenever he perceived a difference among the Iskra-ists over the methods of achieving their common Iskra aim, he consciously and deliberately voted for the worse method, because his, Akimov’s,     aims were diametrically opposed to those of the Iskra-ists. There could not be the slightest doubt therefore that, quite irrespective of the wishes and intentions of Comrade Martov, it was the worse composition of the central bodies that would obtain the support of the Liebers and Akimovs. They could vote, they were bound to vote (judging by their deeds, by their vote on Paragraph 1, and not by their words) precisely for that list which would promise the presence of "people who cause splits", and would do so in order to "cause splits". Is it surprising, in view of this situation, that I said that it was an important question of principle (harmony between the two central bodies), one on which the whole future of the Party might depend? 
 No Social-Democrat at all acquainted with the Iskra ideas and plans and with the history of the movement, and at all earnest in sharing those ideas, could doubt for a moment that while formally it was quite right and proper for the dispute within the Iskra organisation over the composition of the central bodies to be decided by the Liebers and Akimovs, this would ensure the worst possible results. It was imperative to fight to avert these worst possible results. 
 How were we to fight them? We did not fight by hysterics and rows, of course, but by methods which were quite loyal and quite legitimate: perceiving that we were in the minority (as on the question of Paragraph 1), we appealed to the Congress to protect the rights of the minority. Greater strictness as regards the majority required for adoption of members (four-fifths instead of two-thirds), the requirement of unanimity for co-optation, mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies—all this we began to advocate when we found ourselves in the minority on the question of the personal composition of the  central bodies. This fact is constantly ignored by the Ivans and Peters who are so ready to give opinions on the Congress lightly, after a couple of chats with friends, without seriously studying all the minutes and all the "testimony" of the persons concerned. Yet anybody who cares to make a conscientious study of these minutes and this testimony will inevitably encounter the fact I have mentioned, namely, that the root of the dispute at that moment of the Congress was the personal composition of the central bodies, and that we strove for stricter conditions of control just because we were in the minority and wanted "a double knot to bind tight the pot" broken by Martov amid the jubilation and with the jubilant assistance of the Liebers and the Akimovs. 
 "If it were not so," Comrade Pavlovich says, speaking of this moment of the Congress, "one would have to assume that in moving the point about unanimity in cases of co-optation, we were concerned for the interests of our adversaries; for to the side which predominates in any institution unanimity is unnecessary and even disadvantageous." (Letter on the Second Congress, p. 14.) But today the chronological aspect of the events is all too often forgotten; it is forgotten that there wasa whole period at the Congress when the present minority was the majority (thanks to the participation of the Liebers and Akimovs), and that it was precisely at this period that the controversy over co-optation to the central bodies took place, the underlying reason for which was the difference within the Iskra organisation over the personal composition of the central bodies. Whoever grasps this fact will understand the passion that marked our debates and will not be surprised by the seeming paradox that petty differences over details gave rise to really important issues of principle. 
 Comrade Deutsch, speaking at this same sitting (p. 277), was in many respects right when he said: "This motion is undoubtedly designed for the given moment." Yes, indeed, it is only when we have understood the given moment, in all its complexity, that we can understand the true meaning of the controversy. And it is highly important to bear in mind that when we were in the minority, we defended the rights of the minority by such methods as will be acknowledged legitimate and permissible by any European Social-Democrat, namely, by appealing to the Congress for stricter control over the personal composition of the central bodies. Similarly, Comrade Egorov was in many respects right when he said at the Congress, but at a different sitting: "I am exceedingly surprised to hear reference to principles again being made in the debate. [This was said in reference to the elections to the Central Committee, at the 31st sitting of the Congress, that is, if I am not mistaken, on Thursday     morning, whereas the 26th sitting, of which we are now speaking, was held on Monday evening.] I think it is clear to everyone that during the last few days the debate has not revolved around any question of principle, but exclusively around securing or preventing the inclusion of one or another person in the central institutions. Let us acknowledge that principles have been lost at this Congress long since, and call a spade a spade. (General laughter. Murauyov: ’I request to have it recorded in the minutes that Comrade Martov smiled’)" (p. 337). It is not surprising that Comrade Martov, like the rest of us, laughed at Comrade Egorov’s eomplaints, which were indeed ludicrous. Yes, "during the last few days " a very great deal did revolve around the personal composition of the central bodies. That is true. That was indeed clear to everyone at the Congress (and it is only now that the minority is trying to obscure this clear fact). And it is true, lastly, that a spade should be called a spade. But, for God’s sake, where is the "loss of principles" here? After all, we assembled at the Congress in order, in the first days (see p. 101 the Congress agenda), to discuss the programme, tactics, and Rules and to decide the questions relating to them, and the last days (Items 18 and 19 of the agenda) to discuss the personal composition of the central bodies and to decide those questions. When the last days of congresses are devoted to a struggle over the conductor’s baton, that is natural and absolutely legitimate. (But when a fight over the conductor’s baton is waged after congresses, that is squabbling.) If someone suffers defeat at the congress over the personal composition of the central bodies (as Comrade Egorov did), it is simply ludicrous of him, after that, to speak of "loss of principles". It is therefore understandable why everybody laughed at Comrade Egorov. And it is also understandable why Comrade Muravyov requested to have it recorded in the minutes that Comrade Martov shared in the laughter: in laughing at Comrade Egorov, Comrade Martov was laughing at himself.... 
 In addition to Comrade Muravyov’s irony, it will not be superfluous, perhaps, to mention the following fact. As we know, after the Congress Comrade Martov asserted right and left that it was the question of co-optation to the central bodies that played the cardinal role in our divergence,     and that "the majority of the old editorial board" was emphatically opposed to mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies. Before the Congress, when accepting my plan to elect two trios, with mutual co-optation by a two-thirds majority, Comrade Martov wrote to me on the subject: "In adopting this form of mutual co-optation, it should be stressed that after the Congress additions to each body will be effected on somewhat different lines. (I would advise the following: each body co-opts new members, informing the other body of its intention; the latter may enter a protest, in which case the dispute shall be settled by the Council. To avoid delays, this procedure should be followed in relation to candidates nominated in advance—at least in the case of the Central Committee—from whose number the additions may then be made more expeditiously.) In order to stress that subsequent co-optation will be effected in the manner provided by the Party Rules, the following words should be added to  Item 22:[2]   ’. . . by which the decisions taken must be endorsed’." (My italics.) 
 Comment is superfluous. 

 Having explained the significance of the moment when the controversy over co-optation to the central bodies took place, we must dwell a little on the votings on the subject—it is unnecessary to dwell on the discussion, as the speeches of Comrade Martov and myself, already quoted, were followed only by brief interchanges in which very few of the delegates took part (see Minutes, pp. 277-80). In relation to the voting, Comrade Martov asserted at the League Congress that in my account of the matter I was guilty of "the greatest distortion" (League Minutes, p. 60) "in representing the struggle around the Rules [Comrade Martov unwittingly     uttered a profound truth: after Paragraph 1, the heated disputes were indeed around the Rules] as a struggle of Iskra against the Martovites joined in coalition with the Bund." 
 Let us examine this interesting "greatest distortion". Comrade Martov added together the votings on the composition of the Council and the votings on co-optation and listed eight in all: 1) election to the Council of two members each from the Central Organ and the Central Committee—27 for (M), 16 against (L),      7 abstentions.[3]  (Let me say parenthetically that the number of abstentions is shown in the Minutes—p. 270—as 8, but that is a detail.) 2) election of the fifth Council member by the Congress—23 for (L), 18 against (M), 7 abstentions. 3) replacement of lapsed Council members by the Council itself—23 against (M), 16 for (L), 12 abstentions. 4) unanimity for co-optation to the Central Committee—25 for (L), 19 against (M), 7 abstentions. 5) the stipulation for one reasoned protest for non-co-optation—21 for (L), 19 against (M), 11 abstentions. 6) unanimity for co-optation to the Central Organ—23 for (L), 21 against (M), 7 abstentions. 7) votability of a motion giving the Council the right to annul a Central Organ or Central Committee decision not to co-opt a new member—25 for (M), 19 against (L), 7 abstentions. 8) this motion itself—24 for (M), 23 against (L), 4 abstentions. "Here, evidently, " Comrade Martov concluded (League Minutes, p. 61), "one Bund delegate voted for the motion while the rest abstained." (My italics.) 
 Why, may one ask, did Comrade Martov consider it evident that the Bundist had voted for him, Martov, when there were no roll-call votes? 
 Because he counted the number of votes cast, and when it indicated that the Bund had taken part in the voting, he, Comrade Martov, did not doubt that it had been on his, Martov’s, side. 
 Where, then, is the "greatest distortion" on my part? 
 The total votes were 51, without the Bundists 46, without the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists 43. In seven of the eight votings mentioned by Comrade Martov, 43, 41, 39, 44, 40, 44, and     44 delegates took part; in one, 47 delegates (or rather votes), and here Comrade Martov himself admitted that he was supported by a Bundist. We thus find that the picture sketched by Martov (and sketched incompletely, as we shall soon see) only confirms and strengthens my account of the struggle! We find that in a great many cases the number of abstentions was very high: this points to the slight—relatively slight—interest shown by the Congress as a whole in certain minor points, and to the absence of any definite grouping of the Iskra-ists on these questions. Martov’s statement that the Bundists "manifestly helped Lenin by abstaining" (League Minutes, p. 62) in fact speaks against Martov: it means that it was only when the Bundists were absent or abstained that I could sometimes count upon victory. But whenever the Bundists thought it worth while to intervene in the struggle, they supported Comrade Martov; and the above-mentioned case when 47 delegates voted was not the only time they intervened. Whoever cares to refer to the Congress Minutes will notice a very strange incompleteness in Comrade Martov’s picture. Comrade Martov simply omitted three cases when the Bund did take part in the voting, and it goes without saying that in all these cases Comrade Martov was the victor. Here are the three cases: 1) adoption of Comrade Fomin’s amendment to lower the required majority from four-fifths to two-thirds—27 for, 21 against (p. 278), that is, 48 votes. 2) adoption of Comrade Martov’s motion to delete mutual co-optation—26 for, 24 against (p. 279), that is, 50 votes. Lastly, 3) rejection of my motion to permit co-optation to the Central Organ or the Central Committee only with the consent of all members of the Council (p. 280)—27 against, 22 for (there was even a roll-call vote, of which, unfortunately, there is no record in the minutes), that is, 49 votes. 
 To sum up: on the question of co-optation to the central bodies the Bundists took part in only four votings (the three I have just mentioned, with 48, 50, and 49 votes, and the one mentioned by Comrade Martov, with 47 votes). In all these votings Comrade Martov was the victor. My statement of the case proves to be right in every particular: in declaring that there was a coalition with the Bund, in noting the relatively minor character of the questions     (a large number of abstentions in very many cases), and in pointing to the absence of any definite grouping of the Iskra-ists (no roll-call votes; very few speakers in the debates). 
 Comrade Martov’s attempt to detect a contradiction in my statement of the case turns out to have been made with unsound means, for he tore isolated words from their context and did not trouble to reconstruct the complete picture. 
 The last paragraph of the Rules, dealing with the organisation abroad, again gave rise to debates and votings which were highly significant from the point of view of the groupings at the Congress. The question at issue was recognition of the League as the Party organisation abroad. Comrade Akimov, of course, at once rose up in arms, reminding the Congress of the Union Abroad, which had been endorsed by the First Congress, and pointing out that the question was one of principle. "Let me first make the reservation," he said, "that I do not attach any particular practical significance to which way the question is decided. The ideological struggle which has been going on in our Party is undoubtedly not over yet; but it will be continued on a different plane and with a different alignment of forces.... Paragraph 13 of the Rules once more reflects, and in a very marked way, the tendency to convert our Congress from a Party congress into a factional congress. Instead of causing all Social-Democrats in Russia to defer to the decisions of the Party Congress in the name of Party unity, by uniting all Party organisations, it is proposed that the Congress should destroy the organisation of the minority and make the minority disappear from the scene" (p. 281). As the reader sees, the "continuity" which became so dear to Comrade Martov after his defeat over the composition of the central bodies was no less dear to Comrade Akimov. But at the Congress these people who apply different standards to themselves and to others rose up in heated protest against Comrade Akimov. Although the programme had been adopted, Iskra endorsed, and nearly the entire Rules passed, that "principle" which "in principle" distinguished the League from the Union was brought to the fore. "If Comrade Akimov is anxious to make the     issue one of principle," exclaimed Comrade Martov, "we have nothing against it; especially since Comrade Akimov has spoken of possible combinations in a struggle with two trends. The victory of one trend must be sanctioned [this, mark, was said at the 27th sitting of the Congress!] not in the sense that we make another bow to Iskra, but in the sense that we bow a last farewell to all the possible combinations Comrade Akimov spoke of " (p. 282; my italics). 
 What a picture! When all the Congress arguments regarding the programme were already over, Comrade Martov continued to bow a last farewell to all possible combinations . . . until he suffered defeat over the composition of the central bodies! Comrade Martov "bowed a last farewell" at the Congress to that possible "combination" which he cheerfully brought to fruition on the very morrow of the Congress. But Comrade Akimov proved even then to be much more far-sighted than Comrade Martov; Comrade Akimov referred to the five years’ work of "an old Party organisation which, by the will of the First Congress, bears the name of a committee", and concluded with a most venomous and prescient stab: "As to Comrade Martov’s opinion that my hopes of a new trend appearing in our Party are in vain, let me say that even he himself inspires me with such hopes" (p. 283; my italics). 
 Yes, it must be confessed, Comrade Martov has fully justified Comrade Akimov’s hopes! 
 Comrade Martov became convinced that Comrade Akimov was right, and joined him, after the "continuity" had been broken of an old Party body deemed to have been working for three years. Comrade Akimov’s victory did not cost him much effort. 
 But at the Congress Comrade Akimov was backed—and backed consistently—only by Comrades Martynov and Brouckere and the Bundists (eight votes). Comrade Egorov, like the real leader of the "Centre" that he is, adhered to the golden mean: he agreed with the Iskra-ists, you see, he "sympathised" with them (p. 282), and proved his sympathy by the proposal (p. 283) to avoid the question of principle altogether and say nothing about either the League or the Union. The proposal was rejected by twenty-seven votes to fifteen. Apparently, in addition to the anti-Iskra-ists (eight), nearly the entire "Centre" (ten) voted with Comrade     Egorov (the total vote was forty-two, so that a large number abstained or were absent, as often happened during votes which were uninteresting or whose result was a foregone conclusion ). Whenever the question arose of carrying out the "Iskra " principles in practice, it turned out that the "sympathy" of the "Centre" was purely verbal, and we secured only thirty votes or a little over. This was to be seen even more graphically in the debate and votes on Rusov’s motion (??) recognise the League as the sole organisation abroad). Here the anti-Iskra-ists and the "Marsh" took up an outright position of principle, and its champions, Comrades Lieber and Egorov, declared Comrade Rusov’s motion unvotable, impermissible: "It slaughters all the other organisations abroad" (Egorov). And, not desiring to have any part in "slaughtering organisations", the speaker not only refused to vote, but even left the hall. But the leader of the "Centre" must be given his due: he displayed ten times more political manhood and strength of conviction (in his mistaken principles) than did Comrade Martov and Co., for he stood up for an organisation being "slaughtered" not only when that organisation was his own circle, defeated in open combat. 
 Comrade Rusov’s motion was deemed votable by twenty seven votes to fifteen, and was then adopted by twenty five votes to seventeen. If we add to these seventeen the absent Comrade Egorov, we get the full complement (eighteen )      of the anti- "Iskra"-ists and the " Centre". 
 As a whole Paragraph 13 of the Rules, dealing with the organisation abroad, was adopted by only thirty-one votes to twelve, with six abstentions. This figure, thirty-one—showing the approximate number of Iskra-ists at the Congress, that is, of people who consistently advocated Iskra’s views and applied them in practice—we are now encountering for no less than the sixth time in our analysis of the voting at the Congress (place of the Bund question on the agenda, the Organising Committee incident, the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, and two votes on the agrarian programme). Yet Comrade Martov seriously wants to assure us that there are no grounds for picking out such a "narrow" group of Iskra-ists! 
 Nor can we omit to mention that the adoption of Paragraph 13 of the Rules evoked an extremely characteristic     discussion in connection with a statement by Comrades Akimov and Martynov that they "refused to take part in the voting" (p. 288). The Bureau of the Congress discussed this statement and found—with every reason—that not even the direct closing down of the Union would entitle its delegates to refuse to take part in the Congress proceedings. Refusal to vote is absolutely abnormal and impermissible—such was the view of the Bureau, which was shared by the whole Congress, including the Iskra-ists of the minority, who at the 28th sitting hotly condemned what they themselves were guilty of at the 31st! When Comrade Martynov proceeded to defend his statement (p. 291), he was opposed alike by Pavlovich, by Trotsky, by Karsky, and by Martov. Comrade Martov was particularly clear on the duties of a dissatisfied minority (until he found himself in the minority!) and held forth on the subject in a very didactic manner. "Either you are delegates to the Congress," he told Comrades Akimov and Martynov, "in which case you must take part in all its proceedings [my italics; Comrade Martov did not yet perceive any formalism and bureaucracy in subordination of the minority to the majority!]; or you are not delegates, in which case you cannot remain at the sitting.... The statement of the Union delegates compels me to ask two questions: are they members of the Party, and are they delegates to the Congress?" (P. 292.) 
 Comrade Martov instructing Comrade Akimov in the duties of a Party member! But it was not without reason that Comrade Akimov had said that he had some hopes in Comrade Martov.... These hopes were to come true, however, only after Martov was defeated in the elections. When the matter did not concern himself, but others, Comrade Martov was deaf even to the terrible catchword "emergency law", first launched (if I am not mistaken) by Comrade Martynov. "The explanation given us," Comrade Martynov replied to those who urged him to withdraw his statement, "has not made it clear whether the decision was one of principle or an emergency measure against the Union. If the latter, we consider that the Union has been insulted. Comrade Egorov got the same impression as we did, namely, that it was an emergency law [my italics] against the Union, and therefore even left the hall" (p. 295). Both Comrade Martov and     Comrade Trotsky protested vigorously, along with Plekhanov, against the absurd, truly absurd, idea of regarding a vote of the Congress as an insult; and Comrade Trotsky, defending a resolution adopted by the Congress on his motion (that Comrades Akimov and Martynov could consider that full satisfaction had been given them), declared that "the resolution is one of principle, not a philistine one, and it is no business of ours if anybody takes offence at it" (p. 296). But it very soon became apparent that the circle mentality and the philistine outlook are still all too strong in our Party, and the proud words I have italicised proved to be merely a high-sounding phrase. 
 Comrades Akimov and Martynov refused to withdraw their statement, and walked out of the Congress, amidst the delegates’ general cry: "Absolutely unwarranted!"

## The Elections. End of the

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: M. The Elections. End of the Congress








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



M. The Elections. End of the Congress

      After adopting the Rules, the Congress passed a resolution on
      district organisations and a number of resolutions on particular
      Party organisations, and, following the extremely instructive
      debate on the Yuzhny Rabochy group which I have
      analysed above, proceeded to discuss the election of the Party’s
      central institutions.


      We already know that the Iskra organisation, from which
      the entire Congress had expected an authoritative
      recommendation, had split over this question, for the minority
      of the organisation wanted to test in free and open combat
      whether it could not win a majority at the Congress. We also
      know that a plan was known long before the Congress—and to
      all the delegates at the Congress itself—for reconstituting
      the editorial board by the election of two trios, one to the
      Central Organ and one to the Central Committee. Let us dwell on
      this plan in greater detail in order to throw light on the
      Congress debate.
    

      Here is the exact text of my commentary to the
      draft Tagesordnung of the Congress where this plan was

      set

forth:[1]
 

      “The Congress shall elect three persons to the editorial board
      of the Central Organ and three to the Central Committee. These
      six persons in conjunction shall, if necessary, co-opt
      by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the
      editorial board of the Central Organ and to the Central
      Committee and report to this effect to the Congress. After the
      report has been endorsed by the Congress, subsequent co-optation
      shall be effected by the editorial board of the Central Organ
      and by the Central Committee separately.”


      The plan stands out in this text quite definitely and
      unambiguously: it implies a reconstitution of the
      editorial board, effected with the participation of the
      most influential leaders of the practical work. Both the
      features of this plan which I have emphasised are apparent at
      once to anyone who takes the trouble to read the text at all
      attentively. But nowadays one has to stop and explain the most
      elementary things. It was precisely a reconstitution of
      the editorial board that the plan implied—not necessarily
      an enlargement and not necessarily a reduction of its
      membership, but its reconstitution; for the question of a
      possible enlargement or reduction was left open:
      co-optation was provided for only if necessary. Among
      the suggestions for such reconstitution made by various people,
      some provided for a possible reduction of the number of editors,
      and some for increasing it to seven (I personally had always
      regarded seven as far preferable to six), and even to eleven (I
      considered this possible in the event of peaceful union with all
      Social-Democratic organisations in general and with the Bund and
      the Polish Social-Democrats in particular). But what is most
      important, and this is usually overlooked by people talking
      about the “trio”, is that the matter of further co-optation
      to the Central Organ was to be decided with the participation of
      the members of the Central Committee. Not one comrade of
      all the “minority” members of the organisation or Congress
      delegates, who knew of this plan and approved it (either
      explicitly or tacitly), has taken the trouble to explain the
      meaning of this point. Firstly, why was a trio, and only a trio,
      taken as the starting-point for reconstituting the editorial
      board? Obviously, this would have been absolutely
      senseless if the sole, or at least the main,
      purpose had been to enlarge the board, and if that
      board had really been considered a

 

      “harmonious” one. If the
      purpose is to enlarge a “harmonious” body, it would be strange
      to start, not with the whole body, but with only a
      part. Obviously, not all members of the board were
      considered quite suitable for discussing and deciding
      the matter of reconstituting it, of converting the old editorial
      circle into a Party institution. Obviously, even those
      who personally desired the reconstitution to be an enlargement
      recognised that the old composition of the board was not
      harmonious and did not answer to the ideal of a Party
      institution, for otherwise there would be no reason
      first to reduce the six to three in order to
      enlarge it. I repeat, this is self-evident, and only the
      temporary confusion of the issue by “personalities” could have
      caused it to be forgotten.


      Secondly, it will be seen from the above-quoted text that even
      the agreement of all three members of the Central Organ
      would not by itself be enough for the enlargement of the
      trio. This, too, is always lost sight of. Two-thirds of six,
      that is, four votes, were to be required for co-optation; hence
      it would only be necessary for the three members elected to the
      Central Committee to exercise their veto, and no enlargement
      of the trio would be possible. Conversely, even if two of
      the three members of the editorial board of the Central Organ
      were opposed to further co-optation, it would nevertheless be
      possible if all three members of the Central Committee were in
      favour of it. It is thus obvious that the intention was, in
      converting the old circle into a Party institution, to grant the
      deciding voice to the Congress-elected leaders of the
      practical work. Which comrades we roughly had in mind may be
      seen from the fact that prior to the Congress the editorial
      board unanimously elected Comrade Pavlovich a seventh member of
      their body, in case it should be necessary to make a statement
      at the Congress on behalf of the board; in addition to Comrade
      Pavlovich, a certain old member of the Iskra
      organisation and member of the Organising Committee, who was
      subsequently elected to the Central Committee, was proposed
      for the seventh place.


      Thus the plan for the election of two trios was obviously
      designed: 1) to reconstitute the editorial board; 2) to rid it
      of certain elements of the old circle spirit, which is out of
      place in a Party institution (if there had been nothing to get

 

      rid of there would have been no point in the idea of an initial
      trio!); and, lastly, 3) to get rid of the “theocratic” features
      of a body of writers (getting rid of them by enlisting the
      services of prominent practical workers in deciding the
      question of enlarging the trio). This plan, with which all the
      editors were acquainted, was, clearly, based on three years’
      experience of work and fully accorded with the
      principles of revolutionary organisation that we were
      consistently introducing. In the period of disunity in
      which Iskra entered the arena, groups were often formed
      haphazardly and spontaneously, and inevitably suffered from
      certain pernicious manifestations of the circle spirit. The
      creation of a Party presupposed and demanded the elimination of
      these features; the participation of prominent practical workers
      in this elimination was essential, for certain members
      of the editorial board had always dealt with
      organisational affairs, and the body to enter the system of
      Party institutions was to be a body not merely of writers, but
      of political leaders. It was likewise natural, from the
      standpoint of the policy Iskra had always pursued, to
      leave the selection of the initial trio to the Congress: we had
      observed the greatest caution in preparing for the
      Congress, waiting until all controversial questions of principle
      relating to programme, tactics, and organisation had been
      fully clarified; we had no doubt that the
      Congress would be  an “Iskra”-ist one in the
      sense that its overwhelming majority would be solid on these
      fundamental questions (this was also indicated in part by the
      resolutions recognising Iskra as the leading organ); we
      were bound therefore to leave it to the comrades who
      had borne the whole brunt of the work of disseminating
      Iskra’s ideas and preparing for its conversion into a
      party to decide for themselves who were the most
      suitable candidates for the new Party institution. It is
      only by the fact that this plan for “two trios” was a
      natural one, only by the fact that it fully
      accorded with Iskra’s whole policy and with every
      thing known about Iskra to people at all closely
      acquainted with the work, that the general approval of this plan
      and the absence of any rival plan is to be explained.


      And so, at the Congress, Comrade Rusov first of all moved the
      election of two trios. It never even occurred
      to the followers of Martov, who had informed us in writing
      that this

plan was connected with the false accusation of
      opportunism, to reduce the dispute over a board of six or
      three to the question whether this accusation was right or
      wrong. Not one of them even hinted at it! None of them
      ventured to say a single word about the differing shades of
      principle involved in the dispute over six or three. They
      preferred a commoner and cheaper method, namely, to evoke
      pity, to speak of possible injured feelings,
      to pretend that the question of the editorial board had
      already been settled by appointing Iskra the
      Central Organ. This last argument, adduced by Comrade Koltsov
      against Comrade Rusov, was a piece of downright
      falsity. Two separate items were included—not
      fortuitously, of course—in the Congress agenda (see
      Minutes, p. 10): Item 4—“Central Organ of the Party”, and
      Item 18—“Election of the Central Committee and the
      editorial board of the Central Organ”. That in the first
      place. In the second place, when the Central Organ was being
      appointed, all the delegates categorically declared
      that this did not mean the endorsement of the editorial
      board, but only of the

trend,[2]
[2]
      See Minutes, p. 140, Akimov’s speech: “. . . I am told
      that we shall discuss the election of the Central Organ at the
      end”; Muravyov’s speech against Akimov, “who takes the
      question of the future editorial board of the Central Organ very
      much to heart” (p. 141); Pavlovich’s speech to the
      effect that, having appointed the organ, we had obtained “the
      concrete material on which to perform the operations Comrade
      Akimov is so much concerned about”, and that there could not be
      a shadow of doubt about Iskra’s “submitting” to “the
      decisions of the Party” (p. 142), Trotsky’s speech:
      “Since we are not endorsing the editorial board, what is it that
      we are endorsing in Iskra? . . . Not the name, but the
      trend . . . not the name, but the banner” (p. 142),
      Martynov’s speech: “. . . Like many other comrades, I
      consider that while discussing the adoption of Iskra,
      as a newspaper of a definite trend, as our Central Organ, we
      should not at this juncture discuss the method of electing or
      endorsing its editorial board, we shall discuss that later in
      its proper order on the agenda . . . ” (p. 143).
    —Lenin


  and not a single protest was
      raised against these declarations.


      Thus the statement that by endorsing a definite organ the
      Congress had in effect endorsed the editorial board—a
      statement many times reiterated by the adherents of the minority
      (by Koltsov, p. 321, by Posadovsky, p. 321, by Popov, p. 322,
      and by many others)—was simply untrue in fact. It
      was a perfectly obvious manoeuvre to cover a
      retreat
 

      from the position held at the time when the
      question of the composition of the central bodies could still be
      regarded in a really dispassionate light by all. The
      retreat could not be justified either by motives of principle
      (for to raise the question of the “false accusation of
      opportunism” at the Congress was too much to the
      disadvantage of the minority, and they did not even
      hint at it), or by a reference to the factual data
      showing which was actually more effectual—six or three (for
      the mere mention of these facts would have produced a heap of
      arguments against the minority). They had to try to burke the
      issue by talk about a “symmetrical whole”, about a
      “harmonious team”, about a “symmetrical and crystal-integral
      entity”, and so on. It is not surprising that these arguments
      were immediately called by their true name: "wretched
      words " (p. 328). The very plan for a trio clearly
      testified to a lack of “harmony”, and the impressions obtained
      by the delegates during a month and more of work ing together
      obviously afforded a mass of material to enable them to judge
      for themselves. When Comrade Posadovsky hinted at this
      material (incautiously and injudiciously from his own
      standpoint: see pp. 321 and 325 regarding the “qualified sense”
      in which he had used the word “dissonances”), Comrade Muravyov
      bluntly declared: "In my opinion it is now quite clear to the
      majority of the Congress that

such [3]
[3]
      What “dissonances” exactly Comrade Posadovsky had in mind the
      Congress never did learn. Comrade Muravyov, for his part, stated
      at this same sitting (p. 322) that his meaning had been
      misrepresented, and when the minutes were being endorsed he
      plainly declared that he “was referring to the dissonances which
      had been revealed in the Congress debates on various points,
      dissonances over principle, whose existence is now unfortunately
      a fact that nobody will deny” (p. 353).
    —Lenin


dissonances undoubtedly do
      exist" (p. 321). The minority chose to construe the word
      “dissonances” (which was given currency by Posadovsky, not
      Muravyov) in a purely personal sense, not daring to take up the
      gauntlet flung down by Comrade Muravyov, not daring to bring
      forward in defence of the board of six a single
      argument on the actual merits of the case. The result
      was a dispute which for its sterility was more than comic: the
      majority (through the mouth of Comrade Muravyov) declared that
      the true significance of the six or three issue was quite
      clear to them, but the minority

 

      persistently refused to
      listen and affirmed that “we are not in a position to
      examine it”. The majority not only considered themselves in a
      position to examine it, but had “examined it” already and
      announced that the results of the examination were quite
      clear to them, but the minority apparently feared an
      examination and took cover behind mere “wretched
      words”. The majority urged us to “bear in mind that our Central
      Organ is something more than a literary group”; the majority
      “wanted the Central Organ to be headed by quite definite
      persons, persons known to the Congress,
      persons meeting the requirements I have mentioned”
      (that is, not only literary requirements; Comrade Lange’s
      speech, p. 327). Again the minority did not dare to take up the
      gauntlet and did not say a word as to who, in their opinion, was
      suitable for what was more than a literary body, as to who was a
      figure of a “quite definite” magnitude “known to the
      Congress”. The minority continued to take shelter behind their
      celebrated “harmony”. Nor was this all. The minority even
      introduced into the debate arguments which were absolutely false
      in principle and which therefore quite rightly evoked a sharp
      rebuff. “The Congress,” don’t you see, “has neither the moral
      nor the political right to refashion the editorial board”
      (Trotsky, p. 326); “it is too delicate [sic!] a
      question” (Trotsky again); “how will the editors who are not
      re-elected feel about the fact that the Congress does not want
      to see them on the board any more?” (Tsaryov,

p. 324.)[4]


      Such arguments simply put the whole question on the plane of
      pity and injured feelings, and were a direct admission
      of bankruptcy as regards real arguments of principle, real
      political arguments. And the majority immediately gave this
      attitude its true name: philistinism (Comrade
      Rusov). “We are hearing strange speeches from the lips of
      revolutionaries,” Comrade Rusov justly remarked, "speeches that
      are in marked disharmony with the concepts Party work, Party
      ethics. The principal argument on which the opponents of
      electing trios take their stand amounts to a purely
      philistine view of Party affairs [my italics
      throughout]....

 

      If we adopt this standpoint, which is a
      philistine and not a Party standpoint, we shall at
      every election have to consider: will not Petrov be offended if
      Ivanov is elected and not he, will not some member of the
      Organising Committee be offended if another member, and not he,
      is elected to the Central Committee? Where is this going to land
      us, comrades? If we have gathered here for the purpose of
      creating a Party, and not of indulging in mutual compliments
      and philistine sentimentality, then we can never agree to
      such a view. We are about to elect officials, and there
      can be no talk of lack of confidence in any person not elected;
      our only consideration should be the interests of the work
      and a person’s suitability for the post to which he is being
      elected " (p. 325).


      We would advise all who want to make an independent examination
      of the reasons for the Party split and to dig down to the roots
      of it at the Congress to read this speech of Comrade Rusov’s
      over and over again; his arguments were not even
      contested by the minority, let alone refuted. And indeed there
      is no contesting such elementary, rudimentary truths, which were
      forgotten only because of "nervous excitement ", as
      Comrade Rusov himself rightly explained. And this is really the
      explanation least discreditable to the minority of how they
      could desert the Party standpoint for a philistine and circle

      standpoint.[5]




      But the minority were so totally unable to find sensible and
      business-like arguments against election that, in addition to
      introducing philistinism into Party affairs, they resorted to
      downright scandalous practices. Indeed, what other name
      can we give to the action of Comrade Popov when he advised
      Comrade Muravyov “not to undertake delicate
      commissions” (p. 322)? What is this but “getting
      personal”, as Comrade Sorokin rightly put it (p. 328)? What is
      it but speculating on “personalities ”, in the absence
      of political arguments? Was Comrade Sorokin right or
      wrong when he said that “we have always protested against such
      practices”? “Was it permissible for Comrade Deutsch to
      try demonstratively to pillory comrades who did not agree with

      him?”[6]
[6]
      That is the way Comrade Sorokin, at this same sitting,
      understood Comrade Deutsch’s words (cf. p. 324—“sharp
      interchange with Orlov”). Comrade Deutsch explained (p. 351)
      that he had “said nothing like it”, but in thc same
      breath admitted that he had said something very,
      very much “like it”. “I did not say ’who dares’,”
      Comrade Deutsch explained; "what I said was: ’I would be
      interested to see the people who would dare
      [sic!—Comrade Deutsch fell out of the frying pan
      into the fire!] to support such a criminal [sic!]
      proposal as the election

 

of a board of three’" (p. 351). Comrade
      Deutsch did not refute, but confirmed Comrade Sorokin’s
      words. Comrade Deutsch only confirmed the truth of Comrade
      Sorokin’s reproach that “all concepts are here muddled” (in the
      minority’s arguments in favour of six). Comrade Deutsch only
      confirmed the pertinence of Comrade Sorokin’s reminder of the
      elementary truth that “we are Party membors and should
      be guided exclucively by political considerations”. To cry that
      election was criminal was to sink not only to
      philistinism, but to practices that were downright
      scandalous!
    —Lenin

 

      (P. 328.)

 


      Let us sum up the debate on the editorial board. The minority
      did not refute (nor even try to refute) the majority’s numerous
      statements that the plan for a trio was known to the
      delegates at the very beginning of the Congress and
      prior to the Congress, and that, consequently, this plan
      was based on considerations and facts which had no relation
      to the events and disputes at the Congress. In defending
      the board of six, the minority took up a position which was
      wrong and impermissible in principle, one based on
      philistine considerations. The minority displayed an
      utter forgetfulness of the Party attitude towards the
      election of officials, not even attempting to give an
      estimation of each candidate for a post and of his
      suitability or unsuitability for the functions it involved. The
      minority evaded a discussion of the question on its
      merits and talked instead of their celebrated harmony, “shedding
      tears” and “indulging in pathos” (Lange’s speech, p. 327), as
      though “somebody was being murdered”. In their state of
      "nervous excitement " (p. 325) the minority even went
      to the length of "getting personal ", of howling that
      election was “criminal”, and similar impermissible
      practices.


      The battle over six or three at the 30th sitting of our Congress
      was a battle between philistinism and the party
      spirit, between "personalities " of the worst kind
      and political considerations, between wretched
      words and the most elementary conception of
      revolutionary duty.


      And at the 31st sitting, when the Congress, by a majority of
      nineteen to seventeen with three abstentions, had
      rejected the motion to endorse the old editorial board
      as a whole (see p. 330 and the errata), and when the
      former editors had returned to the hall, Comrade Martov
      in his “statement on behalf of the majority of the former
      editorial board”

 

      (pp. 330-31) displayed this same shakiness and instability of
      political position and political concepts to an even
      greater degree. Let us examine in detail each point of this
      collective statement and my reply (pp. 332-33).


      “From now on,” Comrade Martov said when the old editorial board
      was not endorsed, “the old Iskra does not exist, and it
      would be more consistent to change its name. At any rate, we see
      in the new resolution of the Congress a substantial limitation
      of the vote of confidence in Iskra which was passed at
      one of the first Congress sittings.”


      Comrade Martov and his colleagues raised a truly interesting and
      in many respects instructive question of political
      consistency. I have already replied to this by
      referring to what everyone said when Iskra was
      being endorsed (Minutes, p. 349, cf. above,

p. 82).[7]

What we have here is
      unquestionably a crying instance of political inconsistency, but
      whether on the part of the majority of the Congress or of the
      majority of the old editorial board we shall leave the reader to
      judge. And there are two other questions very pertinently raised
      by Comrade Martov and his colleagues which we shall likewise
      leave the reader to decide: 1) Did the desire to detect a
      “limitation of the vote of confidence in Iskra” in the
      Congress decision to elect officials to the
      editorial board of the Central Organ betray a
      philistine or aParty attitude? 2) When
       did the old “Iskra” really cease to
      exist—starting from No. 46, when the two of us,
      Plekhanov and I, began to conduct it, or from No. 53, when the
      majority of the old editorial board took it over? If the first
      question is a most interesting question of principle,
      the second is a most interesting question of fact.


      “Since it has now been decided,” Comrade Martov continued, "to
      elect an editorial board of three, I must declare on my own
      behalf and that of the three other comrades that none of us will
      sit on this new editorial board. For myself, I must add that if
      it be true that certain comrades wanted to include my name in
      the list of candidates for this ’trio’, I must regard it as an
      insult which I have done nothing to deserve [sic!]. I
      say this in view of the circumstances under which it has been
      decided to change the editorial board.

 

      This decision was taken on the grounds of some kind of

      ‘friction’,[8]
[8]
      Comrade Martov was probably referring to Comrade Posadovsky’s
      expression “dissonances”. I repeat that Comrade Posadovsky never
      did explain to the Congress what he meant, while Comrade
      Muravyov, who had likewise used the expression, explained that
      he meant dissonances over principle, as revealed in
      the Congress debates. The reader will recall that the
      sole real debate over principles in which four
      of the editors (Plekhanov, Martov, Axelrod, and I) took part was
      in connection with Paragraph 1 of the rules, and that Comrades
      Martov and Starover complained in writing of a “false
      accusation of opportunism” as being one of the arguments for
      “changing” the editorial board. In this letter, Comrade
      Martov had detected a clear connection between
      “opportunism” and the plan to change the editorial board, but
      at the Congress he confined himself to hinting hazily
      at “some kind of friction”. The “false accusation of
      opportunism” had already been forgotten!
    —Lenin


of the former editorial board having
      been ineffectual; moreover, the Congress decided the matter
      along definite lines without questioning the editorial board
      about this friction or even appointing a commission to report
      whether it had been ineffectual. [Strange that it never occurred
      to any member of the minority to propose to the Congress to
      “question the editorial board” or appoint a commission! Was it
      not because it would have been useless after the split in the
      Iskra organisation and the failure of the negotiations
      Comrades Martov and Starover wrote about?] Under the
      circumstances, I must regard the assumption of certain comrades
      that I would agree to sit on an editorial board reformed in this
      manner as a slur on my political

reputation....”[9]
[9]
      Comrade Martov further added: “Ryazanov might agree to such a
      role, but not the Martov whom, I think, you know by his work.”
      Inasmuch as this was a personal attack on Ryazanov,
      Comrade Martov withdrew the remark. But it was not because of
      Ryazanov’s personal qualities (to refer to them would have been
      out of place) that his name figured at the Congress as a byword;
      it was because of the political complexion of the Borba
      group—its political mistakes. Comrade Martov does
      well to withdraw real or assumed personal insults, but this
      should not lead us to forget political mistakes, which
      should serve as a lesson to the Party. The Borba group
      was accused at our Congress of causing “organisational chaos”
      and “disunity not justifled by any considerations of principle”
      (Comrade Martov’s speech, p. 38). Such
 

political conduct does
      indeed deserve censure, and not only when seen in a small group
      prior to the Party Congress, during the period of
      general chaos, but also when we see it after
      the Party Congress, in the period when the chaos has been
      abolished, even if indulged in by “the majority of the
      Iskra editorial board and the majority of the
      Emancipation of Labour group”.
    —Lenin




      I have purposely quoted this argument in full to acquaint the
      reader with a specimen and with the beginning of what has
      blossomed out so profusely since the Congress and which

 

      cannot be called by any other name than squabbling. I
      have already employed this expression in my Letter to the
      Editors of “Iskra”, and in spite of the editors’ annoyance
      I am obliged to repeat it, for its correctness is beyond
      dispute. It is a mistake to think that squabbling presupposes
      “sordid motives” (as the editors of the new Iskra
      conclude): any revolutionary at all acquainted with our colonies
      of exiles and political émigrés will have witnessed
      dozens of cases of squabbling in which the most absurd
      accusations, suspicions, self-accusations, “personalities”,
      etc., were levelled and harped upon owing to “nervous
      excitement” and abnormal, stagnant conditions of life. No
      sensible person will necessarily seek for sordid
      motives in these squabbles, however sordid their
      manifestations may be. And it is only to “nervous
      excitement” that we can attribute that tangled skein of
      absurdities, personalities, fantastic horrors, and imaginary
      insults and slurs which is contained in the above-quoted passage
      from Comrade Martov’s speech. Stagnant conditions of life breed
      such squabbles among us by the hundred, and a political party
      would be unworthy of respect if it did not have the courage to
      designate its malady by its true name, to make a ruthless
      diagnosis and search for a cure.


      Insofar as anything relating to principles can be extracted at
      all from this tangled skein, one is led inevitably to
      the conclusion that “elections have nothing to do with any slurs
      on political reputations”, that “to deny the right of the
      Congress to hold new elections, make new appointments of any
      kind, and change the composition of its authorised boards” is to
      confuse the issue, and that “Comrade Martov’s views on
      the permissibility of electing part of the old board reflect an
      extreme confusion of political ideas” (as I expressed
      it at the Congress,

       p. 332).[10]


      I shall omit Comrade Martov’s “personal” remark as to who
      initiated the plan for the trio, and shall pass to his

 

      “political” characterisation of the significance attaching to
      the non-endorsement of the old editorial board: ". . What has
      now taken place is the last act of the struggle which has raged
      during the second half of the Congress. [Quite right! And this
      second half of the Congress began when Martov fell into the
      tight clutches of Comrade Akimov over Paragraph 1 of the Rules.]
      It is an open secret that in this reform it is not a question of
      being ’effectual’, but of a struggle for influence on the
      Central Committee. [Firstly, it is an open secret that it
      was a question of being effectual, as well as
      of a divergence over the composition of the Central
      Committee, for the plan of the “reform” was proposed at a time
      when that divergence was nowhere in sight and when
      Comrade Martov joined us in electing Comrade Pavlovich a seventh
      member of the editorial board] Secondly, we have already shown
      by documentary proofs that it was a question of the
      personal composition of the Central Committee, that
      à la fin des fins the matter came down to a
      difference of lists: Glebov-Travinsky-Popov or
      Glebov-Trotsky-Popov.] The majority of the editorial board
      showed that they did not want the Central Committee to be
      converted into a tool of the editorial board. [That is Akimov’s

refrain:



the question of the influence for
      which every majority fights at any and every party congress so
      as then to consolidate it with the help of a
      majority on the central institutions is transferred to
      the plane of opportunist slanders about a “tool” of the
      editorial board, about a “mere appendage” of
      the editorial board, as Comrade Martov himself put it somewhat
      later, p. 334.] That is why it was found necessary to reduce the
      number of members of the editorial board [!!]. And that is why I
      cannot join such an editorial board. [Just examine this “that is
      why” a little more carefully. How might the editorial
      board have converted the Central Committee into an appendage or
      tool? Only if it had had three votes on the Council and
      had abused its superiority. Is that not clear? And is
      it not likewise clear that, having been elected the third
      member, Comrade Martov could always have prevented such an abuse
      and by his vote alone have destroyed all superiority of
      the editorial board on the Council? Consequently, the whole
      matter boils down to the personal composition of the Central
      Committee, and it is at once clear that the talk about a tool
      and an

 

      appendage is slander.] Together with the
      majority of the old editorial board, I thought that the Congress
      would put an end to the ’state of siege’ in the Party and would
      establish a normal state of affairs. But as a matter of fact the
      state of siege, with its emergency laws against particular
      groups, still continues, and has even become more acute. Only if
      the old editorial board remains in its entirety can we guarantee
      that the rights conferred on the editorial board by the Rules
      will not be used to the detriment of the Party....”


      There you have the whole passage from Comrade Martov’s speech in
      which he first advanced the notorious war-cry of a “state of
      siege”. And now look at my reply to him:



      “. . . However, in correcting Martov’s statement about the
      private character of the plan for two trios, I have no intention
      of denying Martov’s assertion of the ’political significance’ of
      the step we took in not endorsing the old editorial board. On
      the contrary, I fully and unreservedly agree with Comrade Martov
      that this step is of great political significance—only not
      the significance which Martov ascribes to it. He said that it
      was an act in a struggle for influence on the Central Committee
      in Russia. I go farther than Martov. The whole activity of
      Iskra as a separate group has hitherto been a struggle
      for influence; but now it is a matter of something more, namely,
      the organisational consolidation of this influence, and not only
      a struggle for it. How profoundly Comrade Martov and I differ
      politically on this point is shown by the fact that he blames me
      for this wish to influence the Central Committee, whereas I
      count it to my credit that I strove and still strive to
      consolidate this influence by organisational means. It appears
      that we are even talking in different languages! What would be
      the point of all our work, of all our efforts, if they ended in
      the same old struggle for influence, and not in its complete
      acquisition and consolidation? Yes, Comrade Martov is absolutely
      right: the step we have taken is undoubtedly a major political
      step showing that one of the trends now to be observed has been
      chosen for the future work of our Party. And I am not at all
      frightened by the dreadful words ’a state of siege in the
      Party’, ’emergency laws against particular individuals
      and groups’, etc. We not only can but we must create

 

      a
      ’state of siege’ in relation to unstable and vacillating
      elements, and all our Party Rules, the whole system of
      centralism now endorsed by the Congress are nothing but a ’state
      of siege’ in respect to the numerous sources of political
      vagueness. It is special laws, even if they are emergency laws,
      that are needed as measures against vagueness, and the step
      taken by the Congress has correctly indicated the political
      direction to be followed, by having created a firm basis for
      such laws and such

      measures.”[11]



      I have italicised in this summary of my speech at the Congress
      the sentence which Comrade Martov preferred to omit in his
      “State of Siege” (p. 16). It is not surprising that he did
      not like this sentence and did not choose to understand its
      obvious meaning.


      What does the expression “dreadful words” imply, Comrade Martov?


      It implies mockery, mockery of those who give big names
      to little things, who confuse a simple question by pretentious
      phrase-mongering.


      The little and simple fact which alone could have
      given, and actually did give, Comrade Martov cause for “nervous
      excitement” was nothing but his defeat at the
      Congress over the personal composition of the central
      bodies. The political significance of this simple fact was
      that, having won, the majority of the Party Congress
      consolidated their influence by establishing their majority in
      the Party leadership as well, by creating an organisational
      basis for a struggle, with the help of the Rules, against what
      this majority considered to be vacillation, instability, and

      vagueness.[12]
[12]
      How was the instability, vacillation, and vagueness of the
      Iskra-ist minority manifested at the Congress? Firstly,
      by their opportunist phrase-mongering over Paragraph 1 of the
      Rules; secondly, by their coalition with Comrades Akimov and
      Lieber, which during the second half of the Congress rapidly
      grew more pronounced; thirdly, by their readiness to degrade the
      question of electing officials to the Central Organ to the level
      of philistinism, of wretched words and even of getting
      personal. After the Congress all these lovely attributes
      developed from mere buds into blossoms and fruit.
    —Lenin


To make this an occasion for talking
      of a “struggle for influence” with horror in one’s eyes and
      complaining of a “state of siege” was nothing but
      pretentious phrase-mongering, dreadful words.



      Comrade Martov does not agree with this? Then perhaps he will
      try to prove to us that a party congress has ever existed, or is
      in general conceivable, where the majority would not proceed to
      consolidate the influence they had gained:
1) by securing a
      majority on the central bodies, and
2) by endowing it with
      powers to counteract vacillation, instability, and vagueness.


      Before the elections, our Congress had to decide whether to give
      one-third of the votes on the Central Organ and on the
      Central Committee to the Party majority or the Party
      minority. The board of six and Comrade Martov’s list meant
      giving one-third to us and two-thirds to his followers. A trio
      on the Central Organ and our list meant two-thirds for us and
      one-third for Comrade Martov’s followers. Comrade Martov refused
      to make terms with us or yield, and challenged us in
      writing to a battle at the Congress. Having suffered defeat
      at the Congress, he began to weep and to complain of a “state of
      siege”! Well, isn’t that squabbling? Isn’t it a new
      manifestation of the wishy-washiness of the intellectual?


      One cannot help recalling in this connection the brilliant
      social and psychological characterisation of this latter quality
      recently given by Karl Kautsky. The Social Democratic parties of
      different countries suffer not infrequently nowadays from
      similar maladies, and it would be very, very useful for us to
      learn from more experienced comrades the correct diagnosis and
      the correct cure. Karl Kautsky’s characterisation of certain
      intellectuals will therefore be only a seeming digression from
      our theme.



      The problem “that again interests us so keenly today is
      the antagonism between the intelligentsia[13]
and the
      proletariat. My colleagues [Kautsky is himself an
      intellectual, a writer and editor] will mostly be indignant that
      I admit this antagonism. But it actually exists, and, as in
      other cases, it would be the most inexpedient tactics to try to
      overcome the fact by denying it. This antagonism is a social
      one, it relates to classes, not to individuals. The individual
      intellectual, like the individual capitalist, may identify
      himself with the proletariat in its class struggle. When he
      does, he changes his character

 

      too. It is not this type
      of intellectual, who is still an exception among his class, that
      we shall mainly speak of in what follows. Unless otherwise
      stated, I shall use the word intellectual to mean only the
      common run of intellectual who takes the stand of bourgeois
      society, and who is characteristic of the intelligentsia as
      a class. This class stands in a certain
      antagonism to the proletariat.
    

      “This antagonism differs, however, from the antagonism between
      labour and capital. The intellectual is not a capitalist. True,
      his standard of life is bourgeois, and he must maintain it if he
      is not to become a pauper; but at the same time he is compelled
      to sell the product of his labour, and often his labour-power,
      and is himself often enough exploited and humiliated by the
      capitalist. Hence the intellectual does not stand in any
      economic antagonism to the proletariat. But his status of life
      and his conditions of labour are not proletarian, and this gives
      rise to a certain antagonism in sentiments and ideas.
    

      “As an isolated individual, the proletarian is nothing. His
      whole strength, his whole progress, all his hopes and
      expectations are derived from organisation, from
      systematic action in conjunction with his fellows. He feels big
      and strong when he forms part of a big and strong organism. This
      organism is the main thing for him; the individual in comparison
      means very little. The proletarian fights with the utmost
      devotion as part of the anonymous mass, without prospect of
      personal advantage or personal glory, doing his duty in any post
      he is assigned to with a voluntary discipline which pervades all
      his feelings and thoughts.
    

      “Quite different is the case of the intellectual. He does not
      fight by means of power, but by argument. His weapons are his
      personal knowledge, his personal ability, his personal
      convictions. He can attain to any position at all only through
      his personal qualities. Hence the freest play for his
      individuality seems to him the prime condition for successful
      activity. It is only with difficulty that he submits to being a
      part subordinate to a whole, and then only from necessity, not
      from inclination. He recognises the need of discipline only for
      the mass, not for the elect minds. And of course he counts
      himself among the latter....
    

      “Nietzsche’s philosophy, with its cult of the superman, for whom
      the fulfilment of his own individuality is everything and any
      subordination of that individuality to a great social aim is
      vulgar and despicable, is the real philosophy of the
      intellectual, and it renders him totally unfit to take part in
      the class struggle of the proletariat.
    

      “Next to Nietzsche, the most outstanding exponent of a
      philosophy answering to the sentiments of the intelligentsia is
      probably Ibsen. His Doctor Stockmann (in An Enemy of the
      People) is not a socialist as many have thought, but the
      type of the intellectual, who is bound to come into conflict
      with the proletarian movement, and with any movement of the
      people generally, as soon as he attempts to work within it. For
      the basis of the proletarian movement, as of every

democratic[14]

movement, is respect for the majority of one’s fellows.

 

      The typical intellectual à la Stockmann regards a
      ’compact majority’ as a monster that must be overthrown....
    

      “An ideal example of an intellectual who had become thoroughly
      imbued with the sentiments of the proletariat, and who, although
      he was a brilliant writer, had quite lost the specific mentality
      of the intellectual, marched cheerfully with the rank and file,
      worked in any post he was assigned to subordinated himself
      whole-heartedly to our great cause, and despised the feeble
      whining [weichliches Gewinsel] about the suppression of
      his individuality which the intellectual trained on Ibsen and
      Nietzsche is prone to indulge in when he happens to be in the
      minority—an ideal example of the kind of intellectual the
      socialist movement needs was Liebknecht. We may also mention
      Marx, who never forced himself to the forefront and whose party
      discipline in the International, where he often found himself in
      the minority, was

     exemplary.”[15]



      Just such feeble whining of intellectuals who happened to find
      themselves in the minority, and nothing more, was the refusal of
      Martov and his friends to be named for office merely because the
      old circle had not been endorsed, as were their complaints of a
      state of siege and emergency laws “against particular groups”,
      which Martov cared nothing about when Yuzhny Rabochy
      and Rabocheye Dyelo were dissolved, but only came to
      care about when his group was dissolved.


      Just such feeble whining of intellectuals who happened to find
      themselves in the minority was that endless torrent of
      complaints, reproaches, hints, accusations, slanders, and
      insinuations regarding the “compact majority” which was started
      by Martov and which poured out in such a flood at our Party

       Congress[16]

(and even more so after).


      The minority bitterly complained that the compact majority held
      private meetings. Well, the minority had to do something to
      conceal
      the unpleasant fact that the delegates it invited to its
      own private meetings refused to attend, while those who would
      willingly have attended (the Egorovs, Makhovs, and
      Brouckères) the minority could not invite after all the
      fighting it had done with them at the Congress.


      The minority bitterly complained of the “false accusation of
      opportunism”. Well, it had to do something to conceal

 

the
      unpleasant fact that it was opportunists, who in most
      cases had followed the anti-Iskra-ists—and partly
      these anti-Iskra-ists themselves—that made up the
      compact minority, seizing with both hands on the championship of
      the circle spirit in Party institutions, opportunism in
      arguments, philistinism in Party affairs, and the instability
      and wishy-washiness of the intellectual.


      We shall show in the next section what is the explanation of the
      highly interesting political fact that a “compact
      majority” was formed towards the end of the Congress, and why,
      in spite of every challenge, the minority so very, very warily
      evades the reasons for its formation and its
      history. But let us first finish our analysis of the
      Congress debates.


      During the elections to the Central Committee, Comrade Martov
      moved a highly characteristic resolution (p. 336), the three
      main features of which I have on occasion referred to as “mate
      in three moves”. Here they are: 1) to ballot lists of
      candidates for the Central Committee, and not the candidates
      individually; 2) after the lists had been announced, to allow
      two sittings to elapse (for discussion, evidently); 3) in the
      absence of an absolute majority, a second ballot to be regarded
      as final. This resolution was a most carefully conceived
      stratagem (we must give the adversary his due!), with which
      Comrade Egorov did not agree (p. 337), but which would most
      certainly have assured a complete victory for Martov if
      the seven Bundists and “Rabocheye Dyelo”-ists had not quit the
      Congress. The reason for this stratagem was that the
      Iskra-ist minority did not have, and could
      not have had, a “direct agreement” (such as there was among
      the Iskra-ist majority) even with the Egorovs and
      Makhovs, let alone the Bund and Brouckère.


      Remember that at the League Congress Comrade Martov complained
      that the “false accusation of opportunism” presumed a direct
      agreement between him and the Bund. I repeat, this only seemed
      so to Comrade Martov in his fright, and this very refusal of
      Comrade Egorov to agree to the balloting of lists (Comrade
      Egorov “had not yet lost his principles”—presumably the
      principles that made him join forces with Goldblatt in
      appraising the absolute importance of democratic guarantees)
      graphically demonstrates the highly important fact that
      there could be no question of
a “direct agreement” even with
      Egorov. But a coalition there could be, and was,
      both with Egorov and with Brouckere, a coalition in the sense
      that the Martovites were sure of their support every
      time they, the Martovites, came into serious conflict with us
      and Akimov and his friends had to choose the lesser
      evil. There was not and is not the slightest doubt that
      Comrades Akimov and Lieber would certainly have voted both
      for the board of six on the Central Organ and for Martov’s list
      for the Central Committee, as being the lesser
      evil, as being  what would least achieve the
      “Iskra” aims (see Akimov’s speech on Paragraph 1
      and the “hopes” he placed in Martov). Balloting of lists,
      allowing two sittings to elapse, and a re-ballot were designed
      to achieve this very result with almost mechanical certainty
      without a direct agreement.


      But since our compact majority remained a compact majority,
      Comrade Martov’s flank movement would only have meant delay, and
      we were bound to reject it. The minority poured forth their
      complaints on this score in a written statement (p. 341) and,
      following the example of Martynov and Akimov,
      refused to vote in the elections to the Central
      Committee, “in view of the conditions in which they were
      held”. Since the Congress, such complaints of abnormal
      conditions at the elections (see State of Siege, p. 31)
      have been poured right and left into the ears of hundreds of
      Party gossips. But in what did this abnormality
      consist? In the secret ballot—which had been stipulated
      beforehand in the Standing Orders of the Congress (Point 6,
      Minutes, p. 11), and in which it was absurd- to detect any
      “hypocrisy” or “injustice”? In the formation of a compact
      majority—that “monster” in the eyes of wishy-washy
      intellectuals? Or in the abnormal desire of these
      worthy intellectuals to violate the pledge they had
      given before the Congress that they would recognise all its
      elections (p. 380, Point 18 of the Congress Regulations)?


      Comrade Popov subtly hinted at this desire when he
      asked outright at the Congress on the day of the elections: “Is
      the Bureau certain that the decision of the Congress is valid
      and in order when half the delegates refused to

vote?”[17]

 
      The Bureau of course replied that it was certain, and recalled
      the incident of Comrades Akimov and Martynov Comrade Martov
      agreed with the Bureau and explicitly declared that Comrade
      Popov was mistaken and that "the decisions of the Congress
      are valid " (p. 343). Now let the reader form his own
      opinion of the political consistency—highly normal, we must
      suppose—revealed by a comparison of this declaration
      made by him in the hearing of the Party with his behaviour
      after the Congress and with the phrase in his State of
      Siege about "the revolt of half the Party which already
      began at the Congress " (p. 20). The hopes which Comrade
      Akimov had placed in Comrade Martov outweighed the ephemeral
      good intentions of Martov himself.
    

      "You have conquered ", Comrade Akimov!
    
 *     *  * 

      Certain features, seemingly petty but actually very important,
      of the end of the Congress, the part of it
      after the elections, may serve to show how pure and
      simple a “dreadful word” was the famous phrase about a “state of
      siege”, which has now for ever acquired a tragicomical
      meaning. Comrade Martov is now making great play with this
      tragicomical “state of siege”, seriously assuring both himself
      and his readers that this bogey of his own invention implied
      some sort of abnormal persecution, hounding, bullying of the
      “minority” by the “majority”. We shall presently show how
      matters stood after the Congress. But take even the end
      of the Congress, and you will find that after the
      elections, far from persecuting the unhappy Martovites, who
      are supposed to have been bullied, ill-treated, and led to the
      slaughter, the “compact majority” itself offered them
      (through Lyadov) two seats out of three on the Minutes
      Committee (p. 354). Take the resolutions on tactical and other
      questions (p. 355 et seq.), and you will find that they were
      discussed on their merits in a purely business-like way, and
      that the signatories to many of the resolutions included both
      representatives of the monstrous compact “majority” and
      followers of the “humiliated and insulted” “minority” (Minutes,
      pp. 355, 357, 363, 365 and 367). This looks like “shutting out
      from work” and “bullying” in general, does it not?



      The only interesting—but, unfortunately, all too
      brief—controversy on the substance of a question arose in
      connection with Starover’s resolution on the liberals. As one
      can see from the signatures to it (pp. 357 and 358), it was
      adopted by the Congress because three of the supporters of the
      “majority” (Braun, Orlov, and

      Osipov[19])
      voted both for it
      and for Plekhanov’s resolution, not perceiving the
      irreconcilable contradiction between the two. No irreconcilable
      contradiction is apparent at first glance, because Plekhanov’s
      resolution lays down a general principle, outlines a defnite
      attitude, as regards principles and tactics, towards
      bourgeois liberalism in Russia, whereas Starover’s
      attempts to define the concrete conditions in which
      “temporary agreements” would be permissible with “liberal
      or liberal-democratic trends”. The subjects of the two
      resolutions are different. But Starover’s suffers from
      political vagueness, and is consequently petty and
      shallow. It does not define the class content of Russian
      liberalism, does not indicate the definite political trends
      in which this is expressed, does not explain to the proletariat
      the principal tasks of propaganda and agitation in relation to
      these definite trends; it confuses (owing to its vagueness) such
      different things as the student movement and
      Osvobozhdeniye, it too pettily and casuistically
      prescribes three concrete conditions under which
      “temporary agreements” would be permissible. Here too, as in
      many other cases, political vagueness leads to casuistry. The
      absence of any general principle and the attempt to enumerate
      “conditions” result in a petty and, strictly speaking,
      incorrect specification of these conditions. Just
      examine Starover’s three conditions: 1) the “liberal or
      liberal-democratic trends” shall “clearly and unambiguously
      declare that in their struggle against the autocratic government
      they will resolutely side with the Russian
      Social-Democrats”. What is the difference between the liberal
      and liberal-democratic trends? The resolution furnishes no
      material for a reply to this question. Is it not that the
      liberal trends speak for the politically least progressive
      sections of the bourgeoisie, and the liberal-democratic—for
      the more progressive sections of the bourgeoisie and the petty
      bourgeoisie? If that is so, can Comrade Starover possibly think
      that the sections of the bourgeoisie which

 

      are least progressive
      (but progressive nevertheless, for otherwise there could be no
      talk of liberalism) can “resolutely side with the
      Social-Democrats”?? That is absurd, and even if the spokesmen of
      such a trend were to "declare it clearly and
      unambiguously " (an absolutely impossible assumption), we,
      the party of the proletariat, would be obliged not to
      believe their declarations. To be a liberal and resolutely
      side with the Social-Democrats—the one excludes the other.


      Further, let us assume a case where “liberal or
      liberal-democratic trends” clearly and unambiguously declare
      that in their struggle against the autocracy they will
      resolutely side with the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
      Such an assumption is far less unlikely than Comrade Starover’s
      (owing to the bourgeois-democratic nature of the
      Socialist-Revolutionary trend). From his resolution, because of
      its vagueness and casuistry, it would appear that in a case
      like this temporary agreements with such liberals would be
      impermissible. But this conclusion, which follows
      inevitably from Comrade Starover’s resolution, is an
      absolutely false one. Temporary agreements are
      permissible with the Socialist-Revolutionaries (see the Congress
      resolution on the latter), and, consequently, with
      liberals who side with the Socialist Revolutionaries.


      Second condition: these trends “shall not include in their
      programmes any demands running counter to the interests of the
      working class or the democracy generally, or obscuring their
      political consciousness”. Here we have the same mistake again:
      there never have been, nor can there be, liberal-democratic
      trends which did not include in their programmes demands running
      counter to the interests of the working class and obscuring its
      (the proletariat’s) political consciousness. Even one of the
      most democratic sections of our liberal-democratic trend, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, put forward in their programme—a
      muddled one, like all liberal programmes—demands that run
      counter to the interests of the working class and obscure its
      political consciousness. The conclusion to be drawn from this
      fact is that it is essential to “expose the limitations
      and inadequacy of the bourgeois emancipation movement”, but not
      that temporary agreements are impermissible.



      Lastly, in the general form in which it is presented, Comrade
      Starover’s third “condition” (that the liberal-democrats should
      make universal, equal, secret, and direct suffrage the slogan of
      their struggle) is likewise incorrect: it would be
      unwise to declare impermissible in all cases temporary and
      partial agreements with liberal-democratic trends whose slogan
      was a constitution with a qualified suffrage, or a “curtailed”
      constitution generally. As a matter of fact, the
      Osvobozhdeniye “trend” would fit into just this
      category, but it would be political short-sightedness
      incompatible with the principles of Marxism to tie one’s hands
      by forbidding in advance “temporary agreements” with even the
      most timorous liberals.


      To sum up: Comrade Starover’s resolution, which was signed also
      by Comrades Martov and Axelrod, is a mistake, and the
      Third Congress would be wise to rescind it. It suffers from
      political vagueness in its theoretical and tactical position,
      from casuistry in the practical “conditions” it stipulates. It
      confuses two questions: 1) the exposure of the
      “anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian” features of
      all liberal-democratic trends, and the need to
      combat these features, and 2) the conditions
      for temporary and partial agreements with any of these
      trends. It does not give what it should (an analysis of the
      class content of liberalism), and gives what it should not
      (prescription of “conditions”). It is absurd in general to draw
      up detailed “conditions” for temporary agreements at a party
      congress, when there is not even a definite partner to such
      possible agreements in view; and even if there were such a
      definite partner in view, it would be a hundred times more
      rational to leave the definition of the “conditions” for a
      temporary agreement to the Party’s central institutions, as the
      Congress did in relation to the Socialist-Revolutionary “trend”
      (see Plekhanov’s modification of the end of Comrade Axelrod’s
      resolution—Minutes, pp. 362 and 15).


      As to the objections of the “minority” to Plekhanov’s
      resolution, Comrade Martov’s only argument was: Plekhanov’s
      resolution “ends with the paltry conclusion that a particular
      writer should be exposed. Would this not be ’using a sledge
      hammer to kill a fly’?” (p. 358.) This argument, whose emptiness
      is concealed by a smart phrase—“paltry
      conclusion”—provides

 

      a new specimen of pompous
      phrase-mongering. Firstly, Plekhanov’s resolution speaks of
      “exposing in the eyes of the proletariat the limitations and
      inadequacy of the bourgeois emancipation movement wherever these
      limitations and inadequacy manifest themselves”. Hence Comrade
      Martov’s assertion (at the League Congress; Minutes, p. 88) that
      “all attention is to be directed only to Struve, only to one
      liberal” is the sheerest nonsense. Secondly, to compare
      Mr. Struve to a “fly” when the possibility of temporary
      agreements with the Russian liberals is in question, is to
      sacrifice an elementary and manifest political fact for a smart
      phrase. No, Mr. Struve is not a fly, but a political magnitude,
      and not because he personally is such a big figure, but because
      of his position as the sole representative of Russian
      liberalism—of at all effectual and organised
      liberalism—in the illegal world. Therefore, to talk of the
      Russian liberals, and of what our Party’s attitude towards them
      should be, without having precisely Mr. Struve and
      Osvobozhdeniye in mind is to talk without saying
      anything. Or perhaps Comrade Martov will show us even one
      single “liberal or liberal-democratic trend” in Russia
      which could compare even remotely today with the
      Osvobozhdeniye trend? It would be interesting to see
      him

try![18]



      “Struve’s name means nothing to the workers,” said Comrade
      Kostrov, supporting Comrade Martov. I hope Comrade Kostrov and
      Comrade Martov will not be offended—but that argument is
      fully in the Akimov style. It is like the argument about the
      proletariat in the genitive

      case.[20]


      Who are the workers to whom Struve’s name (and the name of
      Osvobozhdeniye, mentioned in Comrade Plekhanov’s
      resolution alongside of Mr. Struve) “means nothing”? Those who
      know very little, or nothing at all, of the “liberal and
      liberal-democratic trends” in Russia. One asks, what should be
      the attitude of our Party Congress to such workers: should it
      instruct Party members to acquaint these workers with the only
      definite liberal trend in Russia; or should it refrain from
      mentioning a name with which the workers are little
      acquainted because of their little acquaintance with politics?
      If Comrade Kostrov, having taken one step in the wake of Comrade
      Akimov, does not want to take another, he will answer this
      question in the former sense. And having answered it in the
      former sense, he will see how groundless his argument
      was. At any rate, the words “Struve” and
      "Osvobozhdeniye " in Plekhanov’s resolution are likely
      to be of much more value to the workers than the words “liberal
      and liberal-democratic trend” in Starover’s resolution.


      Except through Osvobozhdeniye, the Russian worker
      cannot at the present time acquaint himself in practice with
      anything like a frank expression of the political tendencies of
      our liberalism. The legal liberal literature is unsuitable for
      this purpose because it is so nebulous. And we must as
      assiduously as possible (and among the broadest possible masses
      of workers) direct the weapon of our criticism against the
      Osvobozhdeniye gentry, so that when the future
      revolution breaks out, the Russian proletariat may, with the
      real criticism of

      weapons,[21]

      paralyse the inevitable attempts of
      the Osvobozhdeniye gentry to curtail the democratic
      character of the revolution.
    


      Apart from Comrade Egorov’s “perplexity”, mentioned above, over
      the question of our “supporting” the oppositional and
      revolutionary movement, the debate on the resolutions

 

      offered little of interest; in fact, there was hardly any debate at all.
    


      The Congress ended with a brief reminder from the chairman that
      its decisions were binding on all Party members.

      Cf. Comrade Posadovsky’s speech: “. . . By electing three of the
      six members of the old editorial board, you pronounce the other
      three to be unnecessary and superfluous. And you have neither
      any right nor any grounds to do that.”
    —Lenin

[5]


      In his State of Siege, Comrade Martov treats this question
      just as he does all the others he touches upon. He does not
      trouble to give a complete picture of the controversy. He very
      modestly evades the only real issue of principle that arose in
      this controversy: philistine sentimentality or the election of
      officials, the Party standpoint, or the injured feelings of the
      Ivan Ivanoviches? Here, too, Comrade Martov confines himself to
      plucking out isolated bits and pieces of what happened and
      adding all sorts of abusive remarks at my expense. That’s not
      quite enough, Comrade Martov!
    

      Comrade Martov particularly pesters me with the
      question why Comrades Axelrod, Zasulich, and Starover
      were not elected at the Congress. The philistine attitude he has
      adopted prevents him from seeing how unseemly these questions
      are (why doesn’t he ask his colleague on the editorial board,
      Comrade Plekhanov?). He detects a contradiction in the fact that
      I regard the behaviour of the minority at the Congress on the
      question of the six as tactless", yet at the same time demand
      Party publicity. There is no contradiction here, as Martov
      himself could easily have seen if he had taken the trouble to
      give a connected account of the whole matter, and not merely
      fragments of it.

 

It was tactless to treat the question from a
      philistine standpoint and appeal to pity and consideration for
      injured feelings; the interests of Party publicity demanded that
      an estimation be given in point of fact of the
      advantages of six as compared with three, an estimation of the
      candidates for the posts, an estimation of the different shades;
      the minority gave not a hint of any of this at the
      Congress.
    

      By carefully studying the minutes, Comrade Martov would have
      found in the delegates’ speeches a whole series of
      arguments against the board of six. Here is a selection from
      these speeches: firstly, that dissonances, in the sense of
      different shades of principle, were clearly apparent in the old
      six; secondly, that a technical simplification of the editorial
      work was desirable; thirdly, that the interests of the work came
      before philistine sentimentality, and only election could ensure
      that the persons chosen were suited for their posts; fourthly,
      that the right of the Congress to choose must not be restricted;
      fifthly, that the Party now needed something more than a
      literary group on the Central Organ, that the Central Organ
      needed not only writers, but administrators as well; sixthly,
      that the Central Organ must consist of quite definite persons,
      persons known to the Congress; seventhly, that a board
      of six was often ineffectual, and the board’s work had been
      accomplished not thanks to its abnormal constitution,
      but in spite of it; eighthly, that the conduct of a
      newspaper was a party (not a circle) affair, etc. Let Comrade
      Martov, if he is so interested in the reasons for the
      non-election of these persons, penetrate into the
      meaning of each of these considerations and refute a single
      one of them.

      At the League Congress Comrade Martov also adduced the following
      argument against Comrade Plekhanov’s resolution: "The chief
      objection to it, the chief defect of this resolution, is that it
      totally ignores the fact that it is our duty, in the struggle
      against the autocracy, not to shun alliance with
      liberal-democratic elements. Comrade Lenin would call this a
      Martynov tendency. This tendency is already being manifested in
      the new Iskra(p. 88)
    

      For the wealth of “gems” it contains, this passage is indeed
      rare.
1) The phrase about alliance with the liberals is
      a sheer muddle. Nobody mentioned alliance, Comrade Martov, but
      only temporary or partial agreements. That is an entirely
      different thing.
2) If Plekhanov’s resolution ignores an
      incredible “alliance” and speaks only of “support” in general,
      that is one of its merits, not a defect.
3) Perhaps Comrade
      Martov will take the trouble to explain what in general
      characterises “Martynov tendencies”? Perhaps he will tell us
      what is the relation between these tendencies and opportunism?
      Perhaps he will trace the relation of these tendencies to
      Paragraph 1 of the Rules?
4) I am just burning with impatience
      to hear from Comrade Martov how “Martynov tendencies” were
      manifested in the “new” Iskra. Please, Comrade Martov,
      relieve me of the torments of suspense!

Lenin is
      referring to a speech made by the Economist Akimov during the Congress
      discussion of the Party programme. One of Akimov’s objections against the
      Iskra draft programme was that it did not mention the word
      “proletariat” in the nominative case, as subject of tile
      sentence, but only in the genitive ("party of the proletariat”). This,
      Akimov claimed, showed a tendency to exalt the party above the proletariat.
    


[21]
      Lenin is alluding to the following passage in Marx’s Introduction to his
      “Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right”:
    


      "The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, take the place of criticism
      with weapons; it is by material force that material force must be
      overthrown.”

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



N. General Picture of the Struggle at the Congress. The
      Revolutionary and Opportunist Wings of the Party

      Having finished our analysis of the Congress debates and voting,
      we must now sum up, so that we may, on the basis of the
      entire Congress material, answer the question: what
      elements, groups, and shades went to make up the final majority
      and minority which we saw in the elections and which were
      destined for a time to become the main division in our Party? A
      summary must be made of all the material relating to shades of
      principle, theoretical and tactical, which the minutes of the
      Congress provide in such abundance. Without a general
      “resumé” without a general picture of the Congress as a
      whole, and of all the principal groupings during the voting,
      this material is too disjointed, too disconnected, so that at
      first sight the individual groupings seem accidental, especially
      to one who does not take the trouble to make an independent and
      comprehensive study of the Congress Minutes (and how
      many readers have taken that trouble?).


      In English parliamentary reports we often meet the
      characteristic word “division”. The House “divided” into such
      and such a majority and minority, it is said when an issue is
      voted. The “division” of our Social-Democratic House on the
      various issues discussed at the Congress presents a picture of
      the struggle within the Party, of its shades of opinion and
      groups, that is unique of its kind and unparalleled for its
      completeness and accuracy. To make the picture a graphic
      one, to obtain a real picture instead of a heap of
      disconnected, disjointed, and isolated facts and incidents, to
      put a stop to the endless and senseless arguments over
      particular votings (who voted for whom and who supported whom?),
      I have decided to try to depict all the basic types

 

      of
      “divisions” at our Congress in the form of a diagram.
      This will probably seem strange to a great many people, but I
      doubt whether any other method can be found that would really
      generalise and summarise the results in the most complete and
      accurate manner possible. Which way a particular delegate voted
      can be ascertained with absolute accuracy in cases when a
      roll-call vote was taken; and in certain important cases when no
      roll-call vote was taken it can be determined from the minutes
      with a very high degree of probability, with a sufficient degree
      of approximation to the truth. And if we take into account
      all the roll-call votes and all the other votes on
      issues of any importance (as judged, for example, by the
      thoroughness and warmth of the debates), we shall obtain the
      most objective picture of our inner Party struggle that the
      material at our disposal permits. In doing so, instead of giving
      a photograph, i.e., an image of each voting separately, we shall
      try to give a picture, i.e., to present all the main
      types of voting, ignoring relatively unimportant
      exceptions and variations which would only confuse matters. In
      any case, anybody will be able with the aid of the minutes to
      check every detail of our picture, to amplify it with any
      particular voting he likes, in short, to criticise it not only
      by arguing, expressing doubts, and making references to isolated
      incidents, but by drawing a different picture on the
      basis of the same material.


      In marking on the diagram each delegate who took part in the
      voting, we shall indicate by special shading the four main
      groups which we have traced in detail through the whole of the
      Congress debates, viz., 1) the Iskra-ists of the
      majority; 2) the Iskra-ists of the minority; 3) the
      “Centre”, and 4) the anti-Iskra-ists. We have seen the
      difference in shades of principle between these groups in a
      host of instances, and if anyone does not like the
      names of the groups, which remind lovers of zigzags too
      much of the Iskra organisation and the Iskra
      trend, we can tell them that it is not the name that
      matters. Now that we have traced the shades through all the
      debates at the Congress, it is easy to substitute for the
      already established and familiar Party appellations (which jar
      on the ears of some) a characterisation of the essence of
      the shades between the groups. Were this

 

      substitution made,
      we would obtain the following names for these same four groups:
      1) consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats; 2) minor
      opportunists; 3) middling opportunists; and 4) major
      opportunists (major by our Russian standards). Let us hope that
      these names will be less shocking to those who have latterly
      taken to assuring themselves and others that Iskra-ist
      is a name which only denotes a “circle”, and not a
      trend.


      Let us now explain in detail the types of voting “snapped” on
      this diagram: 





      The first type of voting (A) covers the cases when the “Centre”
      joined with the Iskra-ists against the
      anti-Iskra-ists or a part of them. It includes the vote
      on the programme as a whole (Comrade Akimov alone

abstained, all the
      others voted for); the vote on the resolution condemning
      federation in principle (all voted for except the five
      Bundists); the vote on Paragraph 2 of the Bund Rules (the five
      Bundists voted against us; five abstained, viz.: Martynov,
      Akimov, Brouckère, and Makhov with his two votes; the rest
      were with us); it is this vote that is represented in
      diagram A. Further, the three votes on the
      question of endorsing Iskra as the Party’s Central
      Organ were also of this type: the editors (five votes)
      abstained; in all three cases there were two votes against
      (Akimov and Brouckère), and, in addition, when the vote on
      the motives for endorsing Iskra was taken, the
      five Bundists and Comrade Martynov

abstained.[1]
[1]
      Why was the vote on Paragraph 2 of the Bund Rules taken for
      depiction in the diagram? Because the votes on endorsing Iskra
      were not as full, while the votes on the programme and on the
      question of federation referred to political decisions of a less
      definite and specific character. Speaking generally, the choice
      of one or another of a number of votes of the same type
      will not in the least affect the main features of the picture,
      as anyone may easily see by making the corresponding changes.
    —Lenin



      This type of voting provides the answer to a very interesting
      and important question, namely, when did the Congress “Centre”
      vote with the Iskra-ists? It was either when the
      anti-“Iskra”-ists, too, were with us, with a few
      exceptions (adoption of the programme, or endorsement of
      Iskra without motives stated), or else when it was a
      question of the sort of statement which was not in
      itself a direct committal to a definite political position
      (recognition of Iskra’s organising work was not in
      itself a committal to carry out its organisational policy in
      relation to particular groups; rejection of the principle of
      federation did not preclude abstention from voting on a specific
      scheme of federation, as we have seen in the case of Comrade
      Makhov). We have already seen, when speaking of the significance
      of the groupings at the Congress in general, how falsely this
      matter is put in the official account of the official Iskra;,
      which (through the mouth of Comrade Martov) slurs and
      glosses over the difference between the Iskra-ists
      and the “Centre”, between consistent revolutionary
      Social-Democrats and opportunists, by citing cases when the
      anti-“Iskra”-ists, too, voted with us! Even the most
      “Right-wing” of the opportunists in the German and French
      Social-Democratic parties never vote against such points as
      the adoption of the programme as a whole.


      The second type of voting (B) covers the cases when the
      Iskra-ists, consistent and inconsistent, voted together
      against all the anti-Iskra-ists and the entire
      “Centre”. These were mostly cases that involved giving effect to
      definite and specific plans of the Iskra policy, that
      is, endorsing Iskra in fact and not only in word. They
      include the Organising Committee

incident;[2]
[2]
      It is this vote that is depicted in Diagram B; the
      Iskra-ists secured thirty-two votes, the Bundist
      resolution sixteen. It should be pointed out that of the votes
      of this type not one was by roll-call. The way the
      individual delegates voted can only be established—but with
      a very high degree of probability—by two sets of evidence:
      1) in the debate the speakers of both groups of
      Iskra-ists spoke in favour those of the
      anti-Iskra-ists and the “Centre” against; 2) the number
      of votes cast in favour was always very close to
      thirty-three. Nor should it be forgotten that when analysing the
      Congress debates we pointed out, quite apart from the voting,
      a number of cases when the “Centre” sided with the
      anti-Iskra-ists (the opportunists) against us. Some of
      these issues were: the absolute value of democratic demands,
      whether we should support the oppositional elements, restriction
      of centralism, etc.
    —Lenin


      the question of making the
      position of the Bund in the Party the first item on the agenda;
      the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group; two votes
      on the agrarian programme, and, sixthly and lastly, the vote
      against the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad
      (Rabocheye Dyelo), that is, the recognition of the



 

      League as the only Party organisation abroad. The old,
      pre-Party, circle spirit, the interests of opportunist
      organisations or groups, the narrow conception of Marxism were
      fighting here against the strictly consistent and principled
      policy of revolutionary Social-Democracy; the
      Iskra-ists of the minority still sided with us in quite
      a number of cases, in a number of exceedingly important votes
      (important from the standpoint of the Organising Committee,
      Yuzhny Rabochy, and Rabocheye Dyelo)
      . . . until their own circle spirit and their own
      inconsistency came into question. The “divisions” of this type
      bring out with graphic clarity that on a number of issues
      involving the practical application of our principles, the
      Centre joined forces with the anti-“Iskra”-ists,
      displaying a much greater kinship with them than with us, a much
      greater leaning in practice towards the
      opportunist than towards the revolutionary
      wing of Social-Democracy. Those who were Iskra-ists
      in name  but were ashamed to be Iskra-ists
      revealed their true nature, and the struggle that inevitably
      ensued caused no little acrimony, which obscured from the less
      thoughtful and more impressionable the significance of the
      shades of principle disclosed in that struggle. But now that the
      ardour of battle has somewhat abated and the minutes remain as a
      dispassionate extract of a series of heated encounters, only
      those who wilfully close their eyes can fail to perceive that
      the alliance of the Makhovs and Egorovs with the Akimovs and
      Liebers was not, and could not be, fortuitous. The only thing
      Martov and Axelrod can do is keep well away from a comprehensive
      and accurate analysis of the minutes, or try at this late date
      to undo their behaviour at the Congress by all sorts of
      expressions of regret. As if regrets can remove
      differences of views and differences of policy! As if the
      present alliance of Martov and Axelrod with Akimov,
      Brouckère, and Martynov can cause our Party, restored at
      the Second Congress, to forget the struggle which the
      Iskra-ists waged with the anti-Iskra-ists
      almost throughout the Congress!


      The distinguishing feature of the third type of voting at the
      Congress, represented by the three remaining parts of the
      diagram (C, D, and E), is that a small section of the
      “Iskra”-ists broke away and went over to the
      anti-“Iskra”-ists,

 

      who accordingly gained the
      victory (as long as they remained at the Congress). In order to
      trace with comp]ete accuracy the development of this celebrated
      coalition of the Iskra-ist minority with the
      anti-Iskra-ists, the mere mention of which drove Martov
      to write hysterical epistles at the Congress, we have reproduced
      all the three main kinds of roll-call votes of this
      type. C is the vote on equality of languages (the last of the
      three roll-call votes on this question is given, it being the
      fullest). All the anti-Iskra-ists and the whole Centre
      stand solid against us; from the Iskra-ists a part of
      the majority and a part of the minority break away. It is
      not yet clear which of the “Iskra”-ists are capable of
      forming a definite and lasting coalition with the opportunist
      “Right wing” of the Congress. Next comes type D—the
      vote on Paragraph 1 of the Rules (of the two votes, we have
      taken the one which was more clear-cut, that is, in which there
      were no abstentions). The coalition stands out more
      saliently and assumes firmer

shape[3]
[3]
Judging by all indications, four other votes on the
      Rules were of the same type: p. 278—27 for Fomin, as
      against 21 for us; p. 279—26 for Martov, as against 24 for
      us; p. 280—27 against me, 22 for; and, on the same page, 24
      for Martov, as against 23 for us. These are the votes on the
      question of co-optation to the central bodies, which I have
      already dealt with. No roll-call votes are available (there was
      one, but the record of it has been lost). The Bundists (all or
      part) evidently saved Martov. Martov’s erroneous
      statements (at the League) concerning these votes have been
      corrected above.
    —Lenin:

      all the
      Iskra-ists of the minority are now on the side of
      Akimov and Lieber, but only a very small number of
      Iskra-ists of the majority, these counterbalancing
      three of the “Centre” and one anti-Iskra-ist who have
      come over to our side. A mere glance at the diagram suffices to
      show which elements shifted from side to side casually and
      temporarily and which were drawn with irresistible force
      towards a lasting coalition with the Akimovs. The last vote
      (E—elections to the Central Organ, the Central Committee,
      and the Party Council), which in fact represents the final
      division into majority and minority, clearly reveals the
      complete fusion of the Iskra-ist minority with the
      entire “Centre” and the remnants of the
      anti-Iskra-ists. By this time, of the eight
      anti-Iskra-ists, only Comrade Brouckère remained
      at the Congress (Comrade Akimov had already explained his
      mistake to him and he had taken his

 

      proper place in the ranks of
      the Martovites). The withdrawal of the seven most
      “Right-wing” of the opportunists decided the issue of the
      elections against

Martov.[4]
[4]
      The seven opportunists who withdrew from the Second Congress
      were the five Bundists (the Bund withdrew from the Party after
      the Second Congress rejected the principle of federation) and
      two Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, Comrade Martynov and Comrade
      Akimov. These latter left the Congress after the
      Iskra-ist League was recognised as the only Party
      organisation abroad, i.e., after the Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ist Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was
      dissolved. (Author’s footnote to the 1907
      edition.—Ed.)
    —Lenin



      And now, with the aid of the objective evidence of votes of
      every type, let us sum up the results of the Congress.
    

      There has been much talk to the effect that the majority at our
      Congress was “accidental”. This, in fact, was Comrade
      Martov’s sole consolation in his Once More in the
      Minority. The diagram clearly shows that in one
      sense, but in only one, the majority could be called
      accidental, viz., in the sense that the withdrawal of the seven
      most opportunist delegates of the "Right "
      was—supposedly—a matter of accident. To
      the extent that this withdrawal was an accident (and no
      more), our majority was accidental. A mere glance at the diagram
      will show better than any long arguments on whose side these
      seven would have been, were bound to have

been.[5]
[5]
      We shall see later that after the Congress both Comrade
      Akimov and the Voronezh Committee, which has the closest
      kinship with Comrade Akimov, explicitly expressed their
      sympathy with the “minority”.

    —Lenin


 But the
      question is: how far was the withdrawal of the seven really an
      accident? That is a question which those who talk so freely
      about the “accidental” character of the majority do not like to
      ask themselves. It is an unpleasant question for them. Was it an
      accident that the most extreme representatives of the
      Right and not of the Left wing of our Party
      were the ones to withdraw? Was it an accident that it was
      opportunists who withdrew, and not consistent
      revolutionary Social-Democrats? Is there no connection
      between this “accidental” withdrawal and the struggle against
      the opportunist wing which was waged throughout the Congress and
      which stands out so graphically in our diagram?


      One has only to ask these questions, which are so unpleasant to
      the minority, to realise what fact all this talk

 

      about the
      accidental character of the majority is intended to conceal. It
      is the unquestionable and incontrovertible fact that the
      minority was formed of those in our Party who gravitate most
      towards opportunism. The minority was formed of those
      elements in the Party who are least stable in theory,
      least steadfast in matters of principle. It was from
      the Right wing of the Party that the minority was
      formed. The division into majority and minority is a direct and
      inevitable continuation of that division of the Social-Democrats
      into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing, into a Mountain
      and a

      Gironde,[9]
      which did not appear only yesterday, nor in the
      Russian workers’ party alone, and which no doubt will not
      disappear tomorrow.


      This fact is of cardinal importance for elucidating the causes
      and the various stages of our disagreements. Whoever tries to
      evade the fact by denying or glossing over the struggle
      at the Congress and the shades of principle that it revealed,
      simply testifies to his own intellectual and political
      poverty. And in order to disprove the fact, it would
      have to be shown, in the first place, that the general
      picture of the voting and “divisions” at our Party Congress was
      different from the one I have drawn; and, in the second
      place, that it was the most consistent revolutionary
      Social-Democrats, those who in Russia have adopted the name of

      Iskra-ists,[6]
[6]
      Note for Comrade Martov’s benefit. If Comrade Martov has now
      forgotten that the term “Iskra”-ist implies the
      follower of a trend and not a member of a circle,
      we would advise him to read in the Congress Minutes the
      explanation Comrade Trotsky gave Comrade Akimov on this
      point. There were three Iskra-ist circles (in
      relation to the Party) at the Congress: the Emancipation of
      Labour group, the Iskra editorial board, and the
      Iskra organisation. Two of these three circles had the
      good sense to dissolve themselves; the third did not display
      enough Party spirit to do so, and was dissolved by the
      Congress. The broadest of the Iskra-ist circles, the
      Iskra organisation (which included the editorial board
      and the Emancipation of Labour group), had sixteen members
      present at the Congress in all, of whom only eleven
      were entitled to vote. Iskra-ists by trend, on
      the other hand, not by membership in any Iskra-ist
      “circle”, numbered, by my calculation, twenty-seven,
      with thirty-three votes. Hence, less than half of the
      Iskra-ists at the Congress belonged to
      Iskra-ist circles.
    —Lenin


 who were in the wrong on the
      substance of all those issues over which the Congress
      “divided”. Well, just try to show that, gentlemen!



      Incidentally, the fact that the minority was formed of the most
      opportunist, the least stable and consistent elements of the
      Party provides an answer to those numerous objections and
      expressions of doubt which are addressed to the majority by
      people who are imperfectly acquainted with the matter, or have
      not given it sufficient thought. Is it not petty, we are told,
      to account for the divergence by a minor mistake of
      Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod? Yes, gentlemen, Comrade
      Martov’s mistake was a minor one (and I said so even at the
      Congress, in the heat of the struggle); but this minor mistake
      could (and did ) cause a lot of harm because
      Comrade Martov was pulled over to the side of delegates who had
      made a whole series of mistakes, had manifested an
      inclination towards opportunism and inconsistency of principle
      on a whole series of questions. That Comrade Martov and Comrade
      Axelrod should have displayed instability was an unimportant
      fact concerning individuals; it was not an individual fact,
      however, but a Party fact, and a not altogether unimportant
      one, that a very considerable minority should have been
      formed of all the least stable elements, of
      all who either rejected Iskra’s trend
      altogether and openly opposed it, or paid lip service to it but
      actually sided time and again with the
      anti-Iskra-ists.


      Is it not absurd to account for the divergence by the
      prevalence of an inveterate circle spirit and revolutionary
      philistinism in the small circle comprised by the old
      Iskra editorial board? No, it is not absurd, because
      all those in our Party who all through the Congress had
      fought for every kind of circle, all those who were
      generally incapable of rising above revolutionary
      philistinism, all those who talked about the “historical”
      character of the philistine and circle spirit in order to
      justify and preserve that evil, rose up in support of
      this particular circle. The fact that narrow circle
      interests prevailed over the Party interest in the one little
      circle of the Iskra editorial board might, perhaps, be
      regarded as an accident; but it was no accident that in staunch
      support of this circle rose up the Akimovs and Brouckères,
      who attached no less (if not more) value to the “historical
      continuity” of the celebrated Voronezh Committee and the
      notorious St. Petersburg “Workers’

      Organisation”[10];

 

      the Egorovs,
      who lamented the “murder” of Rabocheye Dyelo as
      bitterly as the “murder” of the old editorial board (if not more
      so); the Makhovs, etc., etc. You can tell a man by his
      friends—the proverb says. And you can tell a man’s
      political complexion by his political allies, by the
      people who vote for him.


      The minor mistake committed by Comrade Martov and Comrade
      Axelrod was, and might have remained, a minor one until
      it became the starting-point for a durable alliance
      between them and the whole opportunist wing of our Party, until
      it led, as a result of that alliance, to a
      recrudescence of opportunism, to the exaction of
      revenge by all whom Iskra had fought and who
      were now overjoyed at a chance of venting their spleen
      on the consistent adherents of revolutionary
      Social-Democracy. And as a result of the post-Congress events,
      what we are witnessing in the new Iskra is precisely a
      recrudescence of opportunism, the revenge of the Akimovs and
      Brouckères (see the leaflet issued by the Voronezh

      Committee[7]

),

and the glee of the
      Martynovs, who have at last (at last!) been allowed, in the
      detested Iskra, to have a kick at the detested “enemy”
      for each and every former grievance. This makes it particularly
      clear how essential it was to “restore Iskra’s old
      editorial board” (we are quoting from Comrade Starover’s
      ultimatum of November 3, 1903) in order to preserve
      Iskra “continuity”....


      Taken by itself, there was nothing dreadful, nor critical, nor
      even anything abnormal in the fact that the Congress (and the
      Party) divided into a Left and a Right, a revolutionary and an
      opportunist wing. On the contrary, the whole past decade in the
      history of the Russian (and not only the Russian)
      Social-Democratic movement had been leading inevitably and
      inexorably to such a division. The fact that the division took
      place over a number of very minor mistakes of the Right wing, of
      (relatively) very unimportant differences (a fact which seems
      shocking to the superficial observer and to the philistine
      mind), marked a big step forward for our Party as a
      whole. Formerly we used to differ over major issues, such
      as might in some cases even justify a split; now we have reached
      agreement on all

 

      major and important points, and are only
      divided by shades, about which we may and
      should argue, but over which it would be absurd and
      childish to part company (as Comrade Plekhanov has quite rightly
      said in his interesting article “What Should Not Be Done”, to
      which we shall revert). Now, when the anarchistic
      behaviour of the minority since the Congress has
      almost brought the Party to a split, one may often hear
      wiseacres saying: Was it worth while fighting at the Congress
      over such trifles as the Organising Committee incident, the
      dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group or
      Rabocheye Dyelo, or Paragraph 1, or the dissolution of
      the old editorial board, etc.? Those who argue in this

way[8]

are in
      fact introducing the circle standpoint into Party affairs: a
      struggle of shades in the Party is inevitable and
      essential, as long as it does not lead to anarchy and
      splits, as long as it is confined within bounds
      approved by the common consent of all comrades and Party
      members. And our struggle against the Right wing of the
      Party at the Congress, against Akimov and Axelrod,
      Martynov and Martov, in no way exceeded those bounds.
      One need only recall two facts which incontrovertibly prove
      this: 1) when Comrades Martynov and Akimov were about to quit
      the Congress, we were all prepared to do everything to
      obliterate the idea of an “insult”; we all adopted (by
      thirty-two votes) Comrade Trotsky’s motion inviting these
      comrades to regard the explanations as satisfactory and withdraw
      their statement; 2) when it came to the election of the central
      bodies, we were prepared to allow the minority (or the
      opportunist wing) of the Congress a minority on both central
      bodies: Martov on

 

      the Central Organ and Popov on the
      Central Committee. We could not act otherwise from the
      Party standpoint, since even before the Congress we had decided
      to elect two trios. If the difference of shades revealed at
      the Congress was not great, neither was the
      practical conclusion we drew from the struggle between
      these shades: the conclusion amounted solely to this,
      that two-thirds of the seats on both bodies of three
      ought to be given to the majority at the Party Congress.


      It was only the refusal of the minority at the Party
      Congress to be a minority on the central bodies that
      led first to the “feeble whining” of defeated intellectuals, and
      then to anarchistic talk and anarchistic actions.


      In conclusion, let us take one more glance at the diagram from
      the standpoint of the composition of the central bodies. Quite
      naturally, in addition to the question of shades, the
      delegates were faced during the elections with the question of
      the suitability, efficiency, etc., of one or another
      person. The minority are now very prone to confuse
      these two questions. Yet that they are different questions is
      self-evident, and this can be seen from the simple fact, for
      instance, that the election of an initial trio for the
      Central Organ had been pIanned even before the
      Congress, at a time when no one could have foreseen the
      alliance of Martov and Axelrod with Martynov and
      Akimov. Different questions have to be answered in different
      ways: the answer to the question of shades must be sought for in
      the minutes of the Congress, in the open
      discussions and voting on each and every issue. As to the
      question of the suitability of persons, everybody at
      the Congress had decided that it should be settled by secret
      ballot. Why did the whole Congress unanimously
      take that decision? The question is so elementary that it would
      be odd to dwell on it. But (since their defeat at the
      ballot-box) the minority have begun to forget even elementary
      things. We have heard torrents of ardent, passionate speeches,
      heated almost to the point of irresponsibility, in defence of
      the old editorial board, but we have heard absolutely
      nothing about the shades


at the Congress that were
      involved in the struggle over a board of six or three. We hear
      talk and gossip on all sides about the ineffectualness, the
      unsuitability, the evil designs, etc., of the persons elected to
      the Central Committee, but we hear absolutely nothing
      about the shades at the Congress that fought for
      predominance on the Central Committee. To me it seems indecent
      and discreditable to go about talking and gossiping outside
      the Congress about the qualities and actions of individuals
      (for in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred these actions are an
      organisational secret, which can only be divulged to the supreme
      authority of the Party). To fight outside the Congress
      by means of such gossip would, in my opinion, be
      scandal-mongering. And the only public reply I could
      make to all this talk would be to point to the struggle at the
      Congress: You say that the Central Committee was elected by a
      narrow majority. That is true. But this narrow majority
      consisted of all who had most consistently fought, not in words
      but in actual fact, for the realisation of the Iskra
      plans. Consequently, the moral prestige of this
      majority should be even higher—incomparably so—than
      its formal prestige—higher in the eyes of all who
      value the continuity of the Iskra trend above the
      continuity of a particular Iskra circle. Who was
      more competent to judge the suitability of particular
      persons to carry out the Iskra policy—those who fought
      for that pol icy at the Congress, or those who in no few cases
      fought against that policy and defended everything retrograde,
      every kind of old rubbish, every kind of circle mentality?

      I cannot help recalling in this connection a conversation I
      happened to have at the Congress with one of the “Centre”
      delegates. “How oppressive the atmosphere is at our Congress!”
      he complained. “This bitter fighting, this agitation one against
      the other, this biting controversy, this uncomradely attitude!
      . . .” “What a splendid thing our Congress is!” I replied. “A
      free and open struggle. Opinions have been stated. The shades
      have been revealed. The groups have taken shape. Hands have been
      raised. A decision has been taken. A stage has been
      passed. Forward! That’s the stuff for me! That’s life! That’s
      not like the endless, tedious word-chopping of your
      intellectuals, which stops not because the question has been
      settled, but because they are too tired to talk any more....”


      The comrade of the “Centre” stared at me in perplexity and
      shrugged his shoulders. We were talking different languages.

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: O. After the Congress. Two Methods of Struggle








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



O. After the Congress. Two Methods of Struggle

      The analysis of the debates and voting at the Congress, which we
      have now concluded, actually explains in nuce (in
      embryo) everything that has happened since the
      Congress, and we can be brief in outlining the subsequent
      stages of our Party crisis.


      The refusal of Martov and Popov to stand for election
      immediately introduced an atmosphere of squabbling into
      a Party struggle between Party shades. On the very next day
      after the Congress, Comrade Glebov, thinking it incredible that
      the unelected editors could seriously have decided to swing
      towards Akimov and Martynov, and attributing the whole
      thing primarily to irritation, suggested to Plekhanov and me
      that the matter should be ended peaceably and that all four
      should be “co-opted” on condition that proper

 

      representation of
      the editorial board on the Council was guaranteed (i.e., that of
      the two representatives, one was definitely drawn from the
      Party majority). This condition seemed sound to
      Plekhanov and me, for its acceptance would imply a tacit
      admission of the mistake at the Congress, a desire for
      peace instead of war, a desire to be closer to Plekhanov and me
      than to Akimov and Martynov, Egorov and Makhov. The concession
      as regards “co-optation” thus became a personal one,
      and it was not worth while refusing to make a personal
      concession which should clear away the irritation and restore
      peace. Plekhanov and I therefore consented. But the editorial
      majority rejected the condition. Glebov left. We began
      to wait and see what would happen next: whether Martov would
      adhere to the loyal stand he had taken up at the Congress
      (against Comrade Popov, the representative of the
      Centre), or whether the unstable elements who inclined towards a
      split, and in whose wake he had followed, would gain the upper
      hand.


      We were faced with the question: would Comrade Martov choose to
      regard his Congress “coalition” as an isolated political fact
      (just as, si licet parva componere

     magnis,[1]

Bebel’s coalition with Vollmar in
      1895 was an isolated case), or would he want to
      consolidate this coalition, exert himself to prove that
      it was Plekhanov and I who were mistaken at the
      Congress, and become the actual leader of the opportunist wing
      of our Party? This question might be formulated otherwise as
      follows: a squabble or a political Party struggle? Of the three
      of us who on the day after the Congress were the sole available
      members of the central institutions, Glebov inclined most to the
      former answer and made the most efforts to reconcile the
      children who had fallen out. Comrade Plekhanov inclined most to
      the latter answer and was, as the saying goes, neither to hold
      nor to bind. I on this occasion acted the part of “Centre”, or
      “Marsh”, and endeavoured to employ persuasion. To try at this
      date to recall the spoken attempts at persuasion would be a
      hopelessly muddled business, and I shall not follow the bad
      example of Comrade Martov and Comrade Plekhanov. But I do
      consider it necessary to reproduce certain passages

 

      from one
      written attempt at persuasion which I addressed to one of the
      “minority” Iskra-ists:


      “. . . The refusal of Martov to serve on the editorial board,
      his refusal and that of other Party writers to collaborate, the
      refusal of a number of persons to work on the Central Committee,
      and the propaganda of a boycott or passive resistance are bound
      to lead, even if against the wishes of Martov and his friends,
      to a split in the Party. Even if Martov adheres to a loyal stand
      (which he took up so resolutely at the Congress), others will
      not, and the outcome I have mentioned will be inevitable....


      “And so I ask myself: over what, in point of fact, would we be
      parting company? . . . I go over all the events and impressions
      of the Congress; I realise that I often behaved and acted in a
      state of frightful irritation, ’frenziedly’; I am quite willing
      to admit this fault of mine to anyone, if that can be called a
      fault which was a natural product of the atmosphere, the
      reactions, the interjections, the struggle, etc. But examining
      now, quite unfrenziedly, the results attained, the outcome
      achieved by frenzied struggle, I can detect nothing, absolutely
      nothing in these results that is injurious to the Party, and
      absolutely nothing that is an affront or insult to the
      minority.


      “Of course, the very fact of finding oneself in the minority
      could not but be vexatious, but I categorically protest against
      the idea that we ’cast slurs’ on anybody, that we
      wanted to insult or humiliate anybody. Nothing of the
      kind. And one should not allow political differences to lead to
      an interpretation of events based on accusing the other side of
      unscrupulousness, chicanery, intrigue, and the other nice things
      we are hearing mentioned more and more often in this atmosphere
      of an impending split. This should not be allowed, for it is, to
      say the least, the nec plus ultra of irrationality.


      “Martov and I have had a political (and organisational)
      difference, as we had dozens of times before. Defeated over
      Paragraph 1 of the Rules, I could not but strive with all my
      might for revanche in what remained to me (and to the
      Congress). I could not but strive, on the one hand, for a
      strictly Iskra-ist Central Committee, and, on the
      other, for a trio on the editorial board.... I consider this
      trio

 

      the only one capable of being an official
      institution, instead of a body based on indulgence and
      slackness, the only one to be a real centre, each member of
      which would always state and defend his Party viewpoint, not one
      grain more, and irrespective of all personal considerations and
      all fear of giving offence, of resignations, and so on.


      “This trio, after what had occurred at the Congress, undoubtedly
      meant legitimising a political and organisational line in one
      respect directed against Martov. Undoubtedly. Cause a rupture on
      that account? Break up the Party because of it?? Did not Martov
      and Plekhanov oppose me over the question of demonstrations? And
      did not Martov and I oppose Plekhanov over the question of the
      programme? Is not one side of every trio always up against the
      other two? If the majority of the Iskra-ists, both in the Iskra
      organisation and at the Congress, found this particular shade of
      Martov’s line organisationally and politically mistaken, is it
      not really senseless to attempt to attribute this to ’intrigue’,
      ’incitement’, and so forth? Would it not be senseless to try to
      talk away this fact by abusing the majority and calling
      them ’riffraff’?


      “I repeat that, like the majority of the Iskra-ists at the
      Congress, I am profoundly convinced that the line Martov adopted
      was wrong, and that he had to be corrected. To take offence at
      this correction, to regard it as an insult, etc., is
      unreasonable. We have not cast, and are not casting, any ’slurs’
      on anyone, nor are we excluding anyone from work. And
      to cause a split because someone has been excluded from a
      central body seems to me a piece of inconceivable

folly.”[2]
[2]
      This letter (to A. N. Potresov, of August 31 [September 13],
      1903–Ed.) was written in September (New
      Style). I have only omitted what seemed to me irrelevant to the
      matter in hand. If the addressee considers what I have omitted
      important, he can easily repair the omission. Incidentally, let
      me take this opportunity to say that any of my opponents may
      publish any of my private letters should they think a useful
      purpose will be served by it.
    —Lenin



      I have thought it necessary to recall these written statements
      of mine now, because they conclusively prove that the
      majority wanted to draw a definite line at once between
      possible (and in a heated struggle inevitable) personal

 

      grievances and personal irritations caused by biting and
      “frenzied” attacks, etc., on the one hand, and a definite
      political mistake, a definite political line (coalition with the
      Right wing), on the other.


      These statements prove that the passive resistance of
      the minority began immediately after the Congress and
      at once evoked from us the warning that it was a step
      towards splitting the Party; the warning that it ran
      directly counter to their declarations of loyalty at the
      Congress; that the split would be solely over the fact
      of exclusion from the central institutions (that is,
      non-election to them), for nobody ever thought of excluding any
      Party member from work; and that our political
      difference (an inevitable difference, inasmuch as it had not yet
      been elucidated and settled which line at the Congress was
      mistaken, Martov’s or ours) was being perverted more and
      more into a squabble, accompanied by abuse, suspicions, and
      so on and so forth.


      But the warnings were in vain. The behaviour of the minority
      showed that the least stable elements among them, those who
      least valued the Party, were gaining the upper
      hand. This compelled Plekhanov and me to withdraw the consent we
      had given to Glebov’s proposal. For if the minority were
      demonstrating by their deeds their political
      instability not only as regards principles, but even as regards
      elementary Party loyalty, what value could be attached
      to their talk about this celebrated “continuity”?
      Nobody scoffed more wittily than Plekhanov at the utter
      absurdity of demanding the “co-optation” to the Party editorial
      board of a majority consisting of people who frankly proclaimed
      their new and growing differences of opinion! Has there ever
      been a case in the world of a party majority on the central
      institutions converting itself into a minority of its own
      accord, prior to the airing of new differences
      in the press, in full view of the Party? Let the differences
      first be stated, let the Party judge how profound and important
      they were, let the Party itself correct the mistake it had made
      at the Second Congress, should it be shown that it had made a
      mistake! The very fact that such a demand was made on the
      plea of differences still unknown demonstrated the utter
      instability of those who made it, the complete submersion of
      political differences by squabbling, and their entire disrespect

 

      both for the Party as a whole and for their own
      convictions. Never have there been, nor will there be, persons
      of convinced principle who refuse to try to
      convince before they secure (privately ) a
      majority in the institution they want to bring round to their
      standpoint.


      Finally, on October 4, Comrade Plekhanov announced that he would
      make a last attempt to put an end to this absurd state
      of affairs. A meeting was called of all the six members of the
      old editorial board, attended by a new member of the Central

      Committee.[3]
[3]
This Central Committee

member[13]
      arranged, in addition, a number of private and collective talks
      with the minority, in which he refuted the preposterous tales
      that were being spread and appealed to their sense of Party
      duty. —Lenin


      Comrade Plekhanov spent three whole hours proving
      how unreasonable it was to demand “co-optation” of four of the
      “minority” to two of the “majority”. He proposed co-opting
      two of them, so as, on the one hand, to remove all fears
      that we wanted to "bully, suppress, besiege, behead or bury
      anyone, and, on the other, to safeguard the rights and position
      of the Party “majority”. The co-optation of two was likewise
      rejected.


      On October 6, Plekhanov and I wrote the following official
      letter to all the old editors of Iskra and to Comrade
      Trotsky, one of its contributors:


      “Dear Comrades,
    

      “The editorial board of the Central Organ considers it its duty
      officially to express its regret at your withdrawal from
      participation in Iskra and Zarya. In spite of
      the repeated invitations to collaborate which we made to you
      immediately following the Second Party Congress and several
      times after, we have not received a single contribution from
      you. The editors of the Central Organ declare that your
      withdrawal from participation is not justified by anything they
      have done. No personal irritation should serve, of course, as an
      obstacle to your working on the Central Organ of the Party. If,
      on the other hand, your withdrawal is due to any differences of
      opinion with us, we would consider it of the greatest benefit to
      the Party if you were to set forth these differences at
      length. More, we would consider it highly desirable for the
      nature and depth of these differences to be explained

 

      to the
      whole Party as early as possible in the columns of the
      publications of which we are the

editors.”[4]
[4]
      The letter to Comrade Martov contained in addition a reference
      to a certain pamphlet and the following sentence: “Lastly, we
      once more inform you, in the interests of the work, that we are
      still prepared to co-opt you to the editorial board of the
      Central Organ, in order to give you every opportunity officially
      to state and defend your views in the supreme institution of the
      Party.”
    —Lenin



      As the reader sees, it was still quite unclear to us whether the
      actions of the “minority” were principally governed by personal
      irritation or by a desire to steer the organ (and the Party)
      along a new course, and if so, what course exactly. I
      think that if we were even now to set seventy wise men to
      elucidate this question with the help of any literature or any
      testimony you like, they too could make nothing of this
      tangle. I doubt whether a squabble can ever be disentangled: you
      have either to cut it, or set it

       aside.[5]
[5]
Comrade Plekhanov would probably add: “or satisfy each and every
claim of the initiators of the squabble”. We shall see why this was
impossible. —Lenin



      Axelrod, Zasulich, Starover, Trotsky, and Koltsov sent a couple
      of lines in reply to this letter of October 6, to the effect
      that the undersigned were taking no part in Iskra since
      its passage into the hands of the new editorial board. Comrade
      Martov was more communicative and honoured us with the following
      reply:



      “To the Editorial Board of the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P.
    
“Dear Comrades,
    

      “In reply to your letter of October 6 I wish to state the
      following: I consider all our discussions on the subject of
      working together on one organ at an end after the conference
      which took place in the presence of a Central Committee member
      on October 4, and at which you refused to state the reasons that
      induced you to withdraw your proposal to us that Axelrod,
      Zasulich, Starover, and I should join the editorial board on
      condition that we undertook to elect Comrade Lenin our
      ’representative’ on the Council. After you repeatedly evaded at
      this conference formulating the statements you had yourselves
      made in the presence of witnesses, I do not think it necessary
      to explain in a letter to you my motives for refusing to work on
      Iskra under present conditions. Should the need arise,
      I shall explain them in detail to the whole Party, which will
      already be able to learn from the minutes of the Second Congress
      why I rejected the proposal, which you now repeat that I accept
      a seat on the editorial board and on the

Council....[6]

“L. Martov”



      This letter, in conjunction with the previous documents,
      clarifies beyond any possible dispute that question of boycott,
      disorganisation, anarchy, and preparations for a split which
      Comrade Martov (with the help of exclamation marks and rows of
      dots) so assiduously evades in his State of
      Siege—the question of loyal and disloyal methods of
      struggle.


      Comrade Martov and the others are invited to set forth
      their differences, they are asked to tell us plainly
      what the trouble is all about and what their intentions are,
      they are exhorted to stop sulking and to analyse calmly
      the mistake made over Paragraph 1 (which is intimately connected
      with their mistake in swinging to the Right)—but Comrade
      Martov and Co. refuse to talk, and cry: "We are being
      besieged! We are being bullied!"The jibe about “dreadful words”
      has not cooled the ardour of these comical outcries.


      How is it possible to besiege someone who refuses
      to work together with you?—we asked Comrade
      Martov. How is it possible to ill-treat, “bully”, and oppress a
      minority which refuses to be a minority? Being in the
      minority necessarily and inevitably involves certain
      disadvantages. These disadvantages are that you either have to
      join a body which will outvote you on certain questions, or you
      stay outside that body and attack it, and consequently come
      under the fire of well-mounted batteries.


      Did Comrade Martov’s cries about a “state of siege” mean that
      those in the minority were being fought or governed unfairly and
      unloyally? Only such an assertion could have contained
      even a grain of sense (in Martov’s eyes), for, I repeat, being
      in the minority necessarily and inevitably involves certain
      disadvantages. But the whole comedy of the matter is that
      Comrade Martov could not be fought at all as long as he
      refused to talk! The minority could not be governed at all as
      long as they refused to be a minority!


      Comrade Martov could not cite a single fact to show
      that the editorial board of the Central Organ had exceeded or
      abused its powers while Plekhanov and I were on it. Nor could
      the practical workers of the minority cite a single
      fact of a like kind with regard to the Central
      Committee. However Comrade Martov may now twist and turn in his
      State of Siege, it remains absolutely incontrovertible
      that the outcries about a state of siege were nothing but
      “feeble whining”.



      How utterly Comrade Martov and Co. lacked sensible
      arguments against the editorial board appointed by the Congress
      is best of all shown by their own catchword: “We are not serfs!”
      (State of Siege, p. 34.) The mentality of the bourgeois
      intellectual, who counts himself among the “elect minds”
      standing above mass organisation and mass discipline, is
      expressed here with remarkable clarity. To explain
      their refusal to work in the Party by saying that they “are not
      serfs” is to give themselves away completely, to
      confess to a total lack of arguments, an utter inability to
      furnish any motives, any sensible reasons for
      dissatisfaction. Plekhanov and I declare that their refusal is
      not justified by anything we have done; we request them to set
      forth their differences; and all they reply is: “We are not
      serfs” (adding that no bargain has yet been reached on the
      subject of co-optation).


      To the individualism of the intellectual, which already
      manifested itself in the controversy over Paragraph 1, revealing
      its tendency to opportunist argument and anarchistic
      phrase-mongering, all proletarian organisation and
      discipline seems to be serfdom. The reading public will
      soon learn that in the eyes of these “Party members” and Party
      “officials” even a new Party Congress is a serf
      institution that is terrible and abhorrent to the “elect
      minds”.... This “institution” is indeed terrible to people
      who are not averse to making use of the Party title but are
      conscious that this title of theirs does not accord
      with the interests and will of the Party.


      The committee resolutions enumerated in my letter to the editors
      of the new Iskra, and published by Comrade Martov in
      his State of Siege, show with facts that the behaviour
      of the minority amounted all along to sheer
      disobedience of the decisions of the Congress and
      disorganisation of positive practical work. Consisting
      of opportunists and people who detested Iskra, the
      minority strove to rend the Party and damaged and
      disorganised its work, thirsting to avenge their defeat at the
      Congress and sensing that by honest and loyal means (by
      explaining their case in the press or at a congress) they would
      never succeed in refuting the accusation of opportunism
      and intellectualist instability which at the Second Congress had
      been levelled against them.

 

      Realising that they could not convince the Party, they
      tried to gain their ends by disorganising the Party and
      hampering all its work. They were reproached with
      having (by their mistakes at the Congress) caused a crack in our
      pot; they replied to the reproach by trying with all their
      might to smash the pot altogether.


      So distorted had their ideas become that boycott and refusal to
      work were proclaimed to be

“honest[7]

methods” of struggle. Comrade Martov is now
      wriggling all around this delicate point. Comrade Martov is such
      a “man of principle” that he defends boycott . . . when
      practised by the minority, but condemns boycott when, his side
      happening to have become the majority, it threatens Martov
      himself!


      We need not, I think, go into the question whether this is a
      squabble or a “difference of principle” as to what are honest
      methods of struggle in a Social-Democratic workers’ party.



      After the unsuccessful attempts (of October 4 and 6) to obtain
      an explanation from the comrades who had started the
      “co-optation” row, nothing remained for the central institutions
      but to wait and see what would come of their verbal assurances
      that they would adhere to loyal methods of struggle. On October
      10, the Central Committee addressed a circular letter to the
      League (see League Minutes, pp. 3-5), announcing that it was
      engaged in drafting Rules for the League and inviting the League
      members to assist. The Administration of the League had at that
      time decided against a congress of that body (by two votes to
      one; ibid., p. 20). The replies received from minority
      supporters to this circular showed at once that the celebrated
      promise to be loyal and abide by the decisions of the Congress
      was just talk, and that, as a matter of fact, the minority had
      positively decided not to obey the central institutions
      of the Party, replying to their appeals to collaborate with
      evasive excuses full of sophistry and
      anarchistic phrase-mongering. In reply to the famous
      open letter of Deutsch, a member of the Administration (p. 10),
      Plekhanov, myself, and other supporters of the majority
      expressed our vigorous "protest against the gross violations of
      Party discipline

 

      by which an official of the League permits
      himself to hamper the organisational activities of a Party
      institution and calls upon other comrades likewise to violate
      discipline and the Rules. Remarks such as, ’I do not consider
      myself at liberty to take part in such work on the invitation of
      the Central Committee’, or, ’Comrades, we must on no account
      allow it [The Central Committee] to draw up new Rules for the
      League’, etc., are agitational methods of a kind that can only
      arouse disgust in anyone who has the slightest conception of the
      meaning of the words party, organisation, and party
      discipline. Such methods are all the more disgraceful for the
      fact that they are being used against a newly created Party
      institution and are therefore an undoubted attempt to undermine
      confidence in it among Party comrades, and that, moreover, they
      are being employed under the cachet of a member of the League
      Administration and behind the back of the Central Committee.”
      (p. 17.)


      Under such conditions, the League Congress promised to be
      nothing but a brawl.


      From the outset, Comrade Martov continued his Congress tactics
      of “getting personal”, this time with Comrade Plekhanov, by
      distorting private conversations. Comrade Plekhanov protested,
      and Comrade Martov was obliged to withdraw his accusations
      (League Minutes, pp. 39 and 134), which were a product of either
      irresponsibility or resentment.


      The time for the report arrived. I had been the League’s
      delegate at the Party Congress. A mere reference to the summary
      of my report (p. 43

       et seq.)[8]

will show the reader
      that I gave a rough outline of that analysis of the voting at
      the Congress which, in greater detail, forms the contents of the
      present pamphlet. The central feature of the report was
      precisely the proof that, owing to their mistakes, Martov and
      Co. had landed in the opportunist wing of our Party. Although
      this report was made to an audience whose majority consisted of
      violent opponents, they could discover absolutely nothing in it
      which departed from loyal methods of Party struggle and
      controversy.


      Martov’s report, on the contrary, apart from minor “corrections”
      to particular points of my account (the incorrectness

 

      of these
      corrections we have shown above), was nothing but—a product
      of disordered nerves.


      No wonder that the majority refused to carry on the fight in
      this atmosphere. Comrade Plekhanov entered a protest against the
      “scene” (p. 68)—it was indeed a regular "scene
      "!—and withdrew from the Congress without stating the
      objections he had already prepared on the substance of the
      report. Nearly all the other supporters of the majority also
      withdrew from the Congress, after filing a written protest
      against the “unworthy behaviour” of Comrade Martov (League
      Minutes, p. 75).


      The methods of struggle employed by the minority became
      perfectly clear to all. We had accused the minority of
      committing a political mistake at the Congress, of having swung
      towards opportunism, of having formed a coalition with the
      Bundists, the Akimovs, the Brouckères, the Egorovs, and the
      Makhovs. The minority had been defeated at the Congress, and
      they had now “worked out” two methods of struggle,
      embracing all their endless variety of sorties, assaults,
      attacks, etc.


First method—disorganising all the activity of the
      Party, damaging the work, hampering all and everything “without
      statement of reasons”.


Second method—making “scenes”, and so on and so

      forth.[9]
[9]
      I have already pointed out that it would be unwise to attribute
      to sordid motives even the most sordid manifestations of the
      squabbling that is so habitual in the atmosphere of
      émigré and exile colonies. It is a sort of epidemic
      disease engendered by abnormal conditions of life, disordered
      nerves, and so on. I had to give a true picture of this
      system of struggle here, because Comrade Martov has again
      resorted to it in its full scope in his " State of Siege".
    —Lenin



      This “second method of struggle” is also apparent in the
      League’s famous resolutions of “principle”, in the discussion of
      which the “majority”, of course, took no part. Let us examine
      these resolutions, which Comrade Martov has reproduced in his
      State of Siege.


      The first resolution, signed by Comrades Trotsky, Fomin,
      Deutsch, and others, contains two theses directed against the
      “majority” of the Party Congress: 1) “The League expresses its
      profound regret that, owing to the manifestation at the Congress
      of tendencies which essentially

 

      run counter to the earlier
      policy of Iskra, due care was not given in drafting the
      Party Rules to providing sufficient safeguards of the
      independence and authority of the Central Committee.” (League
      Minutes, p. 83.)


      As we have already seen, this thesis of “principle” amounts to
      nothing but Akimov phrase-mongering, the
      opportunist character of which was exposed at the Party
      Congress even by Comrade Popov! In point of fact, the
      claim that the “majority” did not mean to safeguard the
      independence and authority of the Central Committee was never
      anything but gossip. It need only be mentioned that
      when Plekhanov and I were on the editorial board, there was
      on the Council no predominance of the Central Organ over
      the Central Committee, but when the Martovites joined the
      editorial board, the Central Organ secured predominance
      over the Central Committee on the Council! When we were on the
      editorial board, practical workers in Russia
      predominated on the Council over writers residing
      abroad; since the Martovites took over, the contrary has been
      the case. When we were on the editorial board, the Council
      never once attempted to interfere in any
      practical matter; since the unanimous co-optation
      such interference has begun, as the reading public will
      learn in detail in the near future.


      Next thesis of the resolution we are examining: “. . . when
      constituting the official central bodies of the Party, the
      Congress ignored the need for maintaining continuity with the
      actually existing central bodies....”


      This thesis boils down to nothing but the question of the
      personal composition of the central bodies. The
      “minority” preferred to evade the fact that at the Congress the
      old central bodies had proved their unfitness and committed a
      number of mistakes. But most comical of all is the reference to
      “continuity” with respect to the Organising Committee. At the
      Congress, as we have seen, nobody even hinted that the entire
      membership of the Organising Committee should be endorsed. At
      the Congress, Martov actually cried in a frenzy that a list
      containing three members of the Organising Committee was
      defamatory to him. At the Congress, the final list
      proposed by the “minority” contained one member of the
      Organising Committee (Popov, Glebov or Fomin, and
      Trotsky), whereas the list the “majority” put through contained
      two
 

      members of the Organising Committee out of three
      (Travinsky, Vasilyev, and Glebov). We ask, can
      this reference to “continuity” really be considered a
      “difference of principle”?


      Let us pass to the other resolution, which was signed by four
      members of the old editorial board, headed by Comrade
      Axelrod. Here we find all those major accusations against the
      “majority” which have subsequently been repeated many times in
      the press. They can most conveniently be examined as formulated
      by the members of the editorial circle. The accusations are
      levelled against “the system of autocratic and bureaucratic
      government of the Party”, against “bureaucratic centralism”,
      which, as distinct from “genuinely Social-Democratic
      centralism”, is defined as follows: it “places in the forefront,
      not internal union, but external, formal unity, achieved and
      maintained by purely mechanical means, by the systematic
      suppression of individual initiative and independent social
      activity”; it is therefore “by its very nature incapable of
      organically uniting the component elements of society”.


      What “society” Comrade Axelrod and Co. are here referring to,
      heaven alone knows. Apparently, Comrade Axelrod was not quite
      clear himself whether he was penning a Zemstvo address on the
      subject of desirable government reforms, or pouring forth the
      complaints of the “minority”. What is the implication
      of “autocracy” in the Party, about which the dissatisfied
      “editors” clamour? Autocracy means the supreme, uncontrolled,
      non-accountable, non-elective rule of one individual. We know
      very well from the literature of the “minority” that by autocrat
      they mean me, and no one else. When the resolution in
      question was being drafted and adopted, I was on the Central
      Organ together with Plekhanov. Consequently, Comrade Axelrod and
      Co. were expressing the conviction that Plekhanov and all the
      members of the Central Committee “governed the Party”, not in
      accordance with their own views of what the interests of the
      work required, but in accordance with the will of the
      autocrat Lenin. This accusation of autocratic government
      necessarily and inevitably implies pronouncing all members of
      the governing body except the autocrat to be mere tools in the
      hands of another, mere pawns and agents of another’s will. And
      once again we ask, is this

 

      really a “difference of principle” on
      the part of the highly respected Comrade Axelrod?


      Further, what external, formal unity are they here talking
      about, our “Party members” just returned from a Party Congress
      whose decisions they have solemnly acknowledged valid? Do they
      know of any other method of achieving unity in a party organised
      on any at all durable basis, except a party congress? If they
      do, why have they not the courage to declare frankly that they
      no longer regard the Second Congress as valid? Why do they not
      try to tell us their new ideas and new methods of achieving
      unity in a supposedly organised party?


      Further, what “suppression of individual initiative” are they
      talking about, our individualist intellectuals whom the Central
      Organ of the Party has just been exhorting to set forth
      their differences, but who instead have engaged in
      bargaining about “co-optation”? And, in general, how could
      Plekhanov and I, or the Central Committee, have suppressed the
      initiative and independent activity of people who refused to
      engage in any “activity” in conjunction with us? How
      can anyone be “suppressed” in an institution or body in which he
      refuses to have any part? How could the unelected
      editors complain of a “system of government” when they refused
      to "be governed "? We could not have committed
      any errors in directing our comrades for the simple
      reason that they never worked under our direction at all.


      It is clear, I think, that the cries about this celebrated
      bureaucracy are just a screen for dissatisfaction with the
      personal composition of the central bodies, a fig-leaf to cover
      up the violation of a pledge solemnly given at the Congress. You
      are a bureaucrat because you were appointed by the Congress not
      in accordance with my wishes, but against them; you are a
      formalist because you take your stand on the formal decisions of
      the Congress, and not on my consent; you are acting in a grossly
      mechanical way because you cite the “mechanical” majority at the
      Party Congress and pay no heed to my wish to be co-opted; you
      are an autocrat because you refuse to hand over the power to the
      old snug little band who insist on their circle “continuity” all
      the more because they do not like the explicit disapproval of
      this circle spirit by the Congress.



      These cries about bureaucracy have never had any real
      meaning except the one I have

indicated.[10]
[10]
It is enough to point out that Comrade Plekhanov ceased to be a
      supporter of “bureaucratic centralism” in the eyes of the
      minority once he put through the beneficent
      co-optation. —Lenin


And this method of struggle only proves
      once again the intellectualist instability of the minority. They
      wanted to convince the Party that the selection of the central
      bodies was unfortunate. And how did they go about it? By
      criticism of Iskra as conducted by Plekhanov and me?
      No, that they were unable to offer. The method they used
      consisted in the refusal of a section of the Party to work under
      the direction of the hated central bodies. But no central
      institution of any party in the world can ever prove its ability
      to direct people who refuse to accept its direction. Refusal to
      accept the direction of the central bodies is tantamount to
      refusing to remain in the Party, it is tantamount to disrupting
      the Party; it is a method of destroying, not of
      convincing. And these efforts to destroy instead of convince
      show their lack of consistent principles, lack of faith in their
      own ideas.


      They talk of bureaucracy. The word bureaucracy might be
      translated into Russian as concentration on place and
      position. Bureaucracy means subordinating the interests of the
      work to the interests of one’s own career; it
      means focusing attention on places and ignoring the
      work itself; it means wrangling over co-optation
      instead of fighting for ideas. That bureaucracy of this
      kind is undesirable and detrimental to the Party is
      unquestionably true, and I can safely leave it to the reader to
      judge which of the two sides now contending in our Party is
      guilty of such bureaucracy.... They talk about grossly
      mechanical methods of achieving unity. Unquestionably, grossly
      mechanical methods are detrimental; but I again leave it to the
      reader to judge whether a grosser and more mechanical method of
      struggle of a new trend against an old one can be imagined than
      installing people in Party institutions before the Party has
      been convinced of the correctness of their new views, and before
      these views have even been set forth to the Party.


      But perhaps the catchwords of the minority do mean something in
      principle, perhaps they do express some special

 

      group of ideas,
      irrespective of the petty and particular cause which undoubtedly
      started the “swing” in the present case? Perhaps if we were to
      set aside the wrangling over “co-optation”, these catchwords
      might turn out to be an expression of a different system of
      views?


      Let us examine the matter from this angle. Before doing so, we
      must place on record that the first to attempt such an
      examination was Comrade Plekhanov at the League, who pointed out
      the minority’s swing towards anarchism and
      opportunism, and that Comrade Martov (who is now highly
      offended because not everyone is ready to admit that his
      position is one of

principle[11]
[11]
      Nothing could be more comical than the new Iskra’s
      grievance that Lenin refuses to see any differences of
      principle, or denies them. If your attitude had been based more
      on principle, you would the sooner have examined my repeated
      statements that you have swung towards opportunism. If your
      position had been based more on principle, you could not well
      have degraded an ideological struggle to a squabble over
      places. You have only yourselves to blame, for you hava
      yourselves done everything to make it impossible to regard you
      as men of principle. Take Comrade Martov, for example: when
      speaking in his State of Siege, of the League Congress,
      he says nothing about the dispute with Plekhanov over anarchism,
      but instead informs us that Lenin is a super-centre, that Lenin
      has only to wink his eye to have the centre issue orders, that
      the Central Committee rode rough-shod over the League, etc. I
      have no doubt that by picking his topic in this way, Comrade
      Martov displayed the profundity of his ideals and principles.
    —Lenin


)

preferred completely to
      ignore this incident in his State of Siege.


      At the League Congress the general question was raised as to
      whether Rules that the League or a committee may draw up for
      itself are valid without the Central Committee’s endorsement,
      and even if the Central Committee refuses to endorse
      them. Nothing could be clearer, one would think: Rules are a
      formal expression of organisation, and, according to Paragraph 6
      of our Party Rules, the right to organise committees is
      explicitly vested in the Central Committee; Rules define the
      limits of a committee’s autonomy, and the decisive voice in
      defining those limits belongs to the central and not to a local
      institution of the Party. That is elementary, and it
      was sheer childishness to argue with such an air of profundity
      that “organising” does not always imply “endorsing Rules” (as if
      the League itself had not

 

      of its own accord expressed the wish
      to be organised on the basis of formal Rules). But Comrade
      Martov has forgotten (temporarily, let us hope) even the ABC of
      Social-Democracy. In his opinion, the demand that Rules should
      be endorsed only indicated that “the earlier, revolutionary
      Iskra centralism is being replaced by bureaucratic
      centralism” (League Minutes, p. 95), and there, in
      fact—Comrade Martov declared in the same speech—lay
      the “principle” at issue (p. 96)—a principle which he
      preferred to ignore in his State of Siege!


      Comrade Plekhanov answered Martov at once, requesting that
      expressions like bureaucracy, Jack-in-office, etc., be refrained
      from as “detracting from the dignity of the Congress”
      (p. 96). There followed an interchange with Comrade Martov, who
      regarded these expressions as “a characterisation of a certain
      trend from the standpoint of principle”. At that time,
      Comrade Plekhanov, like all the other supporters of the
      majority, took these expressions at their real value, clearly
      realising that they related exclusively to the realm, if we may
      so put it, of “co-optation”, and not of principle. However, he
      deferred to the insistence of the Martovs and Deutsches
      (pp. 96-97) and proceeded to examine their supposed principles
      from the standpoint of principle. “If that were so,”
      said he (that is, if the committees were autonomous in shaping
      their organisation, in drawing up their Rules), "they would be
      autonomous in relation to the whole, to the Party. That is not
      even a Bundist view, it is a downright anarchistic view. That is
      just how the anarchists argue: the rights of individuals are
      unlimited; they may conflict; every individual determines the
      limits of his rights for himself. The limits of autonomy should
      be determined not by the group itself, but by the whole of which
      it forms a part. The Bund was a striking instance of the
      violation of this principle. Hence, the limits of autonomy are
      determined by the Congress, or by the highest body set up by the
      Congress. The authority of the central institution should rest
      on moral and intellectual prestige. There I, of course,
      agree. Every representative of the organisation must be
      concerned for the moral prestige of its institution. But it does
      not follow that, while prestige in necessary, authority is
      not....  To

 

       counterpoise the power of authority to the power
      of ideas is anarchistic talk, which should have no place here"
      (p. 98). These propositions are as elementary as can be, they
      are in fact axioms, which it was strange even to put to the vote
      (p. 102), and which were called in question only because
      “concepts have now been confused” (loc.
      cit). But the minority’s intellectualist individualism
      had, inevitably, driven them to the point of wanting to sabotage
      the Congress, to refuse to submit to the majority; and that wish
      could not be justified except by anarchistic talk. It
      is very amusing to note that the minority had nothing to offer
      in reply to Plekhanov but complaints of his use of
      excessively strong words, like opportunism, anarchism, and so
      forth. Plekhanov quite rightly poked fun at these complaints by
      asking why “the words Jauresism and anarchism are not
      permissible, and the words lèse-majesté and
      Jack-in-office are”. No answer was given. This quaint sort of
      quid pro quo is always happening to Comrades Martov,
      Axelrod, and Co.: their new catchwords clearly bear the stamp of
      vexation; any reference to the fact offends them—they are,
      you see, men of principle; but, they are told, if you deny
      on principle that the part should submit to the whole,
      you are anarchists, and again they are offended!—the
      expression is too strong! In other words, they want to give
      battle to Plekhanov, but only on condition that he does not hit
      back in earnest!
    

      How many times Comrade Martov and various other

“Mensheviks”[12]

      have convicted me, no less childishly, of the following
      “contradiction”. They quote a passage from What Is To Be
Done? or A Letter to a Comrade which speaks of
      ideological influence, a struggle for influence, etc., and
      contrast it to the “bureaucratic” method of inflyencing by means
      of the Rules, to the “autocratic” tendency to rely on authority,
      and the like. How naïve they are! They have already
      forgotten that previously our Party was not a formally organised
      whole, but merely a sum of separate groups, and therefore no
      other relations except those of ideological influence were
      possible between these groups. Now we have become an
      organised Party, and this implies the establishment of

 

      authority, the transformation of the power of ideas into the
      power of authority, the subordination of lower Party bodies to
      higher ones. Why, it positively makes one uncomfortable to have
      to chew over such elementary things for the benefit of old
      associates, especially when one feels that at the bottom of it
      all is simply the minority’s refusal to submit to the majority
      in the matter of the elections! But from the standpoint of
      principle these endless exposures of my contradictions boil
      down to nothing but anarchistic phrase-mongering. The
      new Iskra is not averse to enjoying the title and
      rights of a Party institution, but it does not want to submit to
      the majority of the Party.


      If the talk about bureaucracy contains any principle at all, if
      it is not just an anarchistic denial of the duty of the part to
      submit to the whole, then what we have here is the principle
      of opportunism, which seeks to lessen the responsibility of
      individual intellectuals to the party of the proletariat, to
      lessen the influence of the central institutions, to enlarge the
      autonomy of the least steadfast elements in the Party, to reduce
      organisational relations to a purely platonic and verbal
      acceptance of them. We saw this at the Party Congress, where the
      Akimovs and Liebers made exactly the same sort of speeches about
      “monstrous” centralism as poured from the lips of Martov and
      Co. at the League Congress. That opportunism leads to the Martov
      and Axelrod “views” on organisation by its very nature, and not
      by chance, and not in Russia alone but the world over, we shall
      see later, when examining Comrade Axelrod’s article in the new
      Iskra.

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: P. Little Annoyances Should Not Stand in the Way of a Big Pleasure








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



P. Little Annoyances Should Not Stand in the Way of a Big
    Pleasure

      The League’s rejection of the resolution declaring that its
      Rules must be endorsed by the Central Committee (League Minutes,
      p. 105) was, as the Party Congress majority at once unanimously
      noted, a “crying violation of the Party Rules”.
      Regarded as the act of men of principle, this violation was
      sheer anarchism; while in the atmosphere of the post-Congress
      struggle, it inevitably created the impression that the Party
      minority were trying to “settle

 

      scores” with the Party majority
      (League Minutes, p. 112); it meant that they did not wish to
      obey the Party or to remain within the Party. And when the
      League refused to adopt a resolution on the Central Committee
      statement calling for changes in its Rules (pp. 124-25), it
      inevitably followed that this assembly, which wanted to be
      counted an assembly of a Party organisation but at the same
      time not to obey the Party’s central institution, had to be
      pronounced unlawful. Accordingly, the followers of the
      Party majority at once withdrew from this quasi-Party assembly,
      so as not to have any share in an indecent farce.


      The individualism of the intellectual, with its platonic
      acceptance of organisational relations, which was revealed in
      the lack of steadfastness over Paragraph 1 of the Rules thus in
      practice reached the logical end I had predicted even in
      September, that is, a month and a half before, namely, the point
      of disrupting the Party organisation. And at that
      moment, on the evening of the day the League Congress ended,
      Comrade Plekhanov announced to his colleagues on both the
      Party’s central institutions that he could not bear to “fire on
      his comrades”, that “rather than have a split, it is better to
      put a bullet in one’s brain”, and that, to avert a greater evil,
      it was necessary to make the maximum personal concessions, over
      which, in point of fact (much more than over the principles to
      be discerned in the incorrect position on Paragraph 1), this
      destructive struggle was being waged. In order to give a more
      accurate characterisation of Comrade Plekhanov’s
      right-about-face, which has acquired a certain general Party
      significance, I consider it advisable to rely not on private
      conversations, nor on private letters (that last resort in
      extremity), but on Plekhanov’s own statement of the case to the
      whole Party, namely, his article “What Should Not Be Done” in
      No. 52 of Iskra, which was written just after the
      League Congress, after I had resigned from the editorial board
      of the Central Organ (November 1, 1903), and before the
      co-optation of the Martovites (November 26, 1903).


      The fundamental idea of “What Should Not Be Done” is that in
      politics one must not be too stiff-necked, too harsh and
      unyielding; that it is sometimes necessary, to avoid a split, to
      yield even to revisionists (among those moving

 

      towards us or
      among the inconsistents) and to anarchistic individualists. It
      was only natural that these abstract generalities should arouse
      universal perplexity among Iskra readers. One cannot
      help laughing when reading the proud and majestic statements of
      Comrade Plekhanov (in subsequent articles) that he had not been
      understood because of the novelty of his ideas and because
      people lacked a knowledge of dialectics. In reality, “What
      Should Not Be Done” could only be understood, at the time it was
      written, by some dozen people living in two Geneva suburbs whose
      names both begin with the same

      letter.[8]
      Comrade Plekhanov’s
      misfortune was that he put into circulation among some ten
      thousand readers an agglomeration of hints, reproaches,
      algebraical symbols, and riddles which were intended only for
      these dozen or so people who had taken part in all the
      developments of the post-Congress struggle with the
      minority. This misfortune befell Comrade Plekhanov because he
      violated a basic principle of that dialectics to which he so
      unluckily referred, namely, that there is no abstract truth,
      that truth is always concrete. That is why it was out of place
      to lend an abstract form to the perfectly concrete idea of
      yielding to the Martovites after the League Congress.


      Yielding—which Comrade Plekhanov advocated as a new
      war-cry—is legitimate and essential in two cases: when the
      yielder is convinced that those who are striving to make him
      yield are in the right (in which case, honest political leaders
      frankly and openly admit their mistake), or when an irrational
      and harmful demand is yielded to in order to avert a greater
      evil. It is perfectly clear from the article in question that it
      is the latter case the author has in mind: he speaks plainly of
      yielding to revisionists and anarchistic individualists (that
      is, to the Martovites, as every Party member now knows from the
      League Minutes), and says that it is essential in order to avert
      a split. As we see, Comrade Plekhanov’s supposedly novel idea
      amounts to no more than the not very novel piece of commonplace
      wisdom that little annoyances should not be allowed to stand in
      the way of a big pleasure, that a little opportunist folly and a
      little anarchistic talk is better than a big Party split. When
      Comrade Plekhanov wrote this article he clearly realised that
      the minority represented

 

      the opportunist wing of our Party and
      that they were fighting with anarchistic weapons. Comrade
      Plekhanov came forward with the plan to combat this minority by
      means of personal concessions, just as (again si licet parva
      componere magnis) the German Social-Democrats combated
      Bernstein. Bebel publicly declared at congresses of his Party
      that he did not know anyone who was so susceptible to the
      influence of environment as Comrade Bernstein (not
      Mr. Bernstein, as Comrade Plekhanov was once so fond of calling
      him, but Comrade Bernstein): let us take him into our
      environment, let us make him a member of the Reichstag, let us
      combat revisionism, not by inappropriate harshness (à
      la Sobakevich-Parvus) towards the revisionist, but by
      “killing him with kindness”—as Comrade M. Beer, I recall,
      put it at a meeting of English Social-Democrats when defending
      German conciliatoriness, peaceableness, mildness, flexibility,
      and caution against the attack of the English
      Sobakevich—Hyndman. And in just the same way, Comrade
      Plekhanov wanted to “kill with kindness” the little anarchism
      and the little opportunism of Comrades Axelrod and Martov. True
      while hinting quite plainly at the “anarchistic individualists”,
      Comrade Plekhanov expressed himself in a deliberately vague way
      about the revisionists; he did so in a manner to create the
      impression that he was referring to the Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ists, who were swinging from opportunism towards
      orthodoxy, and not to Axelrod and Martov, who had begun to swing
      from orthodoxy towards revisionism. But this was only
      an innocent military

ruse,[1]
[1]
      There was never any question after the Party Congress of making
      concessions to Comrades Martynov, Akimov, and Brouckère. I
      am not aware that they too demanded “co-optation”. I even doubt
      whether Comrade Starover or Comrade Martov consulted Comrade
      Brouckère when they sent us their epistles and “notes”? in
      the name of “half the Party”. . . . At the League Congress
      Comrade Martov rejected, with the profound indignation of an
      unbending political stalwart the very idea of a “union with
      Ryazanov or Martynov”, of the possibility of a “deal” with them,
      or even of joint “service to the Party” (as an editor; League
      Minutes, p. 53). At the League Congress Comrade Martov sternly
      condemned “Martynov tendencies” (p. 88), and when Comrade

      Orthodox[11]
      subtly hinted that Axelrod and Martov no doubt
      “consider that Comrades Akimov, Martynov, and others also have
      the right to get together, draw up Rules for themselves, and act
      in accordance with them as they see fit” (p. 99), the Martovites
      denied

 

it, as Peter denied Christ (p. 100: “Comrade Orthodox’s
      fears” “regarding the Akimovs, Martynovs, etc.”, “have no
      foundation”).
    —Lenin


a feeble bulwark

 

      that was incapable of
      withstanding the artillery fire of Party publicity.


      And anyone who acquaints himself with the actual state of
      affairs at the political juncture we are describing, anyone who
      gains an insight into Comrade Plekhanov’s mentality, will
      realise that I could not have acted in this instance otherwise
      than I did. I say this for the benefit of those supporters of
      the majority who have reproached me for surrendering the
      editorial board. When Comrade Plekhanov swung round after the
      League Congress and from being a supporter of the majority
      became a supporter of reconciliation at all costs, I was obliged
      to put the very best interpretation on it. Perhaps Comrade
      Plekhanov wanted in his article to put forward a programme for
      an amicable and honest peace? Any such programme boils down to a
      sincere admission of mistakes by both sides. What was the
      mistake Comrade Plekhanov laid at the door of the majority? An
      inappropriate, Sobakevich-like, harshness towards the
      revisionists. We do not know what Comrade Plekhanov had in mind
      by that: his witticism about the asses, or his extremely
      incautious—in Axelrod’s presence—reference to
      anarchism and opportunism. Comrade Plekhanov preferred to
      express himself “abstractly”, and, moreover, with a hint at the
      other fellow. That is a matter of taste, of course. But, after
      all, I had admitted my personal harshness openly both in the
      letter to the Iskra-ist and at the League Congress. How
      then could I refuse to admit that the majority were guilty of
      such a “mistake”? As to the minority, Comrade Plekhanov pointed
      to their mistake quite clearly, namely, revisionism (cf. his
      remarks about opportunism at the Party Congress and about
      Jauresism at the League Congress) and anarchism which had led to
      the verge of a split. Could I obstruct an attempt to secure an
      acknowledgement of these mistakes and undo their harm by means
      of personal concessions and “kindness” in general? Could I
      obstruct such an attempt when Comrade Plekhanov in “What Should
      Not Be Done” directly appealed to us to "spare the
      adversaries " among the revisionists who were revisionists
      “only because of a certain inconsistency”? And if I did not
      believe

 

      in this attempt, could I do otherwise than make a
      personal concession regarding the Central Organ and move over to
      the Central Committee in order to defend the position of the

      majority?[2]
[2]
      Comrade Martov put it very aptly when he said that I had moved
      over avec armes et bagages. Comrade Martov is very fond
      of military metaphors: campaign against the League, engagement,
      incurable wounds, etc., etc. To tell the truth, I too have a
      great weakness for military metaphors especially just now, when
      one follows the news from the Pacific with such eager
      interest. But, Comrade Martov, if we are to use military
      language, the story goes like this. We capture two forts at the
      Party Congress. You attack them at the League Congress. After
      the first brief interchange of shots, my colleague, the
      commandant of one of the forts, opens the gates to the
      enemy. Naturally, I gather together the little artillery I have
      and move into the other fort, which is practically unfortified,
      in order to “stand siege” against the enemy’s overwhelming
      numbers. I even make an offer of peace for what chance do I
      stand against two powers? But in reply to my offer, the new
      allies bombard my last fort. I return the fire. Where upon my
      former colleague—the commandant—exclaims in
      magnificent indignation: “Just look, good people, how bellicose
      this Chamberlain is!”
    —Lenin


I could not absolutely deny the
      feasibility of such attempts and take upon myself the full onus
      for the threatening split, if only because I had myself been
      inclined, in the letter of October 6, to attribute the wrangle
      to “personal irritation”. But I did consider, and still
      consider, it my political duty to defend the position of the
      majority. To rely in this on Comrade Plekhanov would have been
      difficult and risky, for everything went to show that he was
      prepared to interpret his dictum that “a leader of the
      proletariat has no right to give rein to his warlike
      inclinations when they run counter to political good
      sense”—to interpret it in a dialectical way to mean that if
      you had to fire, then it was better sense (considering the state
      of the weather in Geneva in November) to fire at the
      majority.... To defend the majority’s position was essential,
      because, when dealing with the question of the free (?) will of
      a revolutionary, Comrade Plekhanov—in defiance of
      dialectics, which demands a concrete and comprehensive
      examination—modestly evaded the question of confidence
      in a revolutionary, of confidence in a “leader of the
      proletariat” who was leading a definite wing of the Party. When
      speaking of anarchistic individualism and advising us to close
      our eyes “at times” to violations of

 

      discipline and to yield
      “sometimes” to intellectualist license, which “is rooted in a
      sentiment that has nothing to do with devotion to the
      revolutionary idea”, Comrade Plekhanov apparently forgot that we
      must also reckon with the free will of the majority of the
      Party, and that it must be left to the practical
      workers to determine the extent of the concessions
      to be made to the anarchistic individualists. Easy as it is to
      fight childish anarchistic nonsense on the literary plane, it is
      very difficult to carry on practical work in the same
      organisation with an anarchistic individualist.A writer who took
      it upon himself to determine the extent of the concessions that
      might be made to anarchism in practice would only be betraying
      his inordinate and truly doctrinaire literary conceit. Comrade
      Plekhanov majestically remarked (for the sake of importance, as

      Bazarov[9]
      used to say) that if a new split were to occur the
      workers would cease to understand us; yet at the same time he
      initiated an endless stream of articles in the new
      Iskra whose real and concrete meaning was bound to be
      incomprehensible not only to the workers, but to the world at
      large. It is not surprising that when a member of the Central
      Committee read the proofs of “What Should Not Be Done” he warned
      Comrade Plekhanov that his plan to somewhat curtail the size of
      a certain publication (the minutes of the Party Congress and the
      League Congress) would be defeated by this very article, which
      would excite curiosity, offer for the judgement of the man in
      the street something that was piquant and at the same time quite
      incomprehensible to

him,[3]
[3]
      We are having a heated and passionate argument in
      private. Suddenly one of us jumps in, flings open the window,
      and begins to clamour against Sobakeviches, anarchistic
      individualists, revisionists, etc. Naturally, a crowd of curious
      idlers gathers in the street and our enemies rub their hands in
      glee. Other of the disputants go to the window too and want to
      give a coherent account of the whole matter, without hinting at
      things nobody knows anything about. Thereupon the window is
      banged to on the plea that it is not worth while discussing
      squabbles (Iskra, No. 53, p. 8, col. 2, line
      24 up). It was not worth while beginning in " Iskra" on
      a discussion of “squabbles”, Comrade

      Plekhanov[12]—that would be nearer the truth!
      —Lenin


and inevitably cause people to ask in
      perplexity: “What has happened?” It is not surprising that owing
      to the abstractness of its arguments and the vagueness of its
      hints, this article

 

      of Comrade Plekhanov’s caused jubilation in
      the ranks of the enemies of Social-Democracy—the dancing of
      the cancan in the columns of Revolutsionnaya
      Rossiya and ecstatic praises from the consistent
      revisionists in Osvobozhdeniye. The source of all these
      comical and sad misunderstandings, from which Comrade Plekhanov
      later tried so comically and so sadly to extricate himself, lay
      precisely in the violation of that basic principle of
      dialectics: concrete questions should be examined in all their
      concreteness. The delight of Mr. Struve, in particular, was
      quite natural: he was not in the least interested in the “good”
      aims (killing with kindness) which Comrade Plekhanov pursued
      (but might not achieve); Mr. Struve welcomed, and could not but
      welcome, that swing towards the opportunist wing of our
      Party which had begun in the new Iskra, as
      everybody can now plainly see. The Russian bourgeois democrats
      are not the only ones to welcome every swing to wards
      opportunism, even the slightest and most temporary, in any
      Social-Democratic party. The estimate of a shrewd enemy is very
      rarely based on sheer misunderstanding: you can tell a man’s
      mistakes by the people who praise him. And it is in vain that
      Comrade Plekhanov hopes the reader will be inattentive and tries
      to make out that the majority unconditionally objected to a
      personal concession in the matter of co-optation, and not to a
      desertion from the Left wing of the Party to the Right. The
      point is not that Comrade Plekhanov made a personal concession
      in order to avert a split (that was very praiseworthy), but
      that, though fully realising the need to join issue
      with the inconsistent revisionists and anarchistic
      individualists, he chose instead to join issue with the
      majority, with whom he parted company over the extent
      of the possible practical concessions to anarchism. The point is
      not that Comrade Plekhanov changed the personal composition of
      the editorial board, but that he betrayed his position of
      opposing revisionism and anarchism and ceased to defend that
      position in the Central Organ of the Party.


      As to the Central Committee, which at this time was the sole
      organised representative of the majority, Comrade Plekhanov
      parted company with it then exclusively over the possible
      extent of practical concessions to anarchism. Nearly

 

      a
      month had elapsed since November 1, when my resignation had
      given a free hand to the policy of killing with
      kindness. Comrade Plekhanov had had every opportunity, through
      all sorts of contacts, to test the expedience of this
      policy. Comrade Plekhanov had in this period published his
      article “What Should Not Be Done”, which was—and
      remains—the Martovites’ sole ticket of admittance, so
      to speak, to the editorial board. The
      watchwords—revisionism (which we should contend with, but
      sparing the adversary) and anarchistic individualism (which
      should be courted and killed with kindness)—were printed on
      this ticket in imposing italics. Do come in, gentlemen, please,
      I will kill you with kindness—is what Comrade Plekhanov
      said by this invitation card to his new colleagues on the
      editorial board. Naturally, all that remained to the Central
      Committee was to say its last word (that is what ultimatum
      means—a last word as to a possible peace) about what, in
      its opinion, was the permissible extent of practical concessions
      to anarchistic individualism. Either you want peace—in
      which case here are a certain number of seats to prove our
      kindness, peaceableness, readiness to make concessions, etc. (we
      cannot allow you any more if peace is to be guaranteed in the
      Party, peace not in the sense of an absence of controversy, but
      in the sense that the Party will not be destroyed by anarchistic
      individualism); take these seats and swing back again little by
      little from Akimov to Plekhanov. Or else you want to maintain
      and develop your point of view, to swing over altogether to
      Akimov (if only in the realm of organisational questions), and
      to convince the Party that you, not Plekhanov, are right—in
      which case form a writers’ group of your own, secure
      representation at the next Congress, and set about winning a
      majority by an honest struggle, by open controversy. This
      alternative, which was quite explicitly submitted to the
      Martovites in the Central Committee ultimatum of November 25,
      1903 (see State of Siege and Commentary on the League

      Minutes[4]

),

was in full harmony with the letter
      Plekhanov and I had sent to the former editors on October 6,
      1903:

 

      either it is a matter of personal irritation (in which
      case, if the worst comes to the worst, we might even
      “co-opt”), or it is a matter of a difference of principle (in
      which case you must first convince the Party, and only then talk
      about changing the personal composition of the central
      bodies). The Central Committee could the more readily leave it
      to the Martovites to make this delicate choice for themselves
      since at this very time Comrade Martov in his
      profession de foi (Once More in the Minority)
      wrote the following:
    

      “The minority lay claim to only one honour, namely, to be the
      first in the history of our Party to show that one can be ’defeated’
      and yet not form a new party. This position of the minority
      follows from all their views on the organisational development of the
      Party; it follows from the consciousness of their strong ties with the
      Party’s earlier work. The minority do not believe in the mystic power of
      ’paper revolutions’, and see in the deep roots which their
      endeavours have in life a guarantee that by purely
      ideological propaganda within the Party they will secure the triumph of
      their principles of organisation.” (My italics.)

 


      What proud and magnificent words! And how bitter it was to be taught by
      events that they were—merely words.... I hope you will
      forgive me, Comrade Martov, but now I claim on behalf of the
      majority this “honour” which you have not deserved. The
      honour will indeed be a great one, one worth fighting for, for the circles
      have left us the tradition of an extraordinarily light-hearted attitude
      towards splits and an extraordinarily zealous application of the maxim:
      “either coats off, or let’s have your hand!”



      The big pleasure (of having a united Party) was bound to
      outweigh, and did outweigh, the little annoyances (in the shape
      of the squabbling over co-optation). I resigned from the Central
      Organ, and Comrade Y (who had been delegated by Plekhanov and
      myself to the Party Council on behalf of the editorial board of
      the Central Organ) resigned from the Council. The Martovites
      replied to the Central Committee’s last word as to peace with a
      letter (see publications mentioned) which was tantamount to a
      declaration of war. Then, and only then, did I write my letter
      to the editorial board (Iskra, No. 53) on the subject
      of

      publicity.[5]

If it comes to talking about
      revisionism and discussing inconsistency, anarchistic
      individualism, and the defeat of various leaders, then,
      gentlemen, let us tell all that occurred, without
      reservation—that was the gist of this letter about
      publicity. The editorial board replied with angry abuse and the
      lordly admonition: do not dare to stir up "the pettiness and
      squabbling of circle life " (Iskra, No. 53). Is
      that so, I thought to myself: “the pettiness and squabbling of
      circle life”?... Well, es ist mir recht, gentlemen,
      there I agree with you. Why, that means that you directly class
      all this fuss over “co-optation” as circle squabbling.
      That is true. But what discord is this?—in the editorial of
      this same issue, No. 53, this same editorial board (we must
      suppose) talks about bureaucracy, formalism, and the

rest.[6]
[6]
      As it subsequently turned out, the “discord” was explained very
      simply—it was a discord among the editors of the Central
      Organ. It was Plekhanov who wrote about “squabbling” (see his
      admission in “A Sad Misunderstanding”, No. 57), while the
      editorial, “Our Congress”, was written by Martov (State of
      Siege, p. 84). They were tugging in different directions.
    —Lenin

 

      Do not dare to raise the question of the fight for co-optation
      to the Central Organ, for that would be squabbling. But we will
      raise the question of co-optation to the Central Committee, and
      will not call it squabbling, but a difference of principle on
      the subject of “formalism”. No, dear comrades, I said to myself,
      permit me not to permit you that. You want to fire at my fort,
      and yet demand that I surrender my artillery. What jokers you
      are! And so I wrote and published outside of Iskra my
      Letter to the Editors (Why I Resigned from the
      “Iskra” Editorial

Board),[7]

briefly relating what
      had really occurred, and asking yet again whether peace was not
      possible on the basis of the following division: you take the
      Central Organ, we take the Central Committee. Neither side will
      then feel “alien” in the Party, and we will argue about the
      swing towards opportunism, first in the press, and then,
      perhaps, at the Third Party Congress.


      In reply to this mention of peace the enemy opened fire with all
      his batteries, including even the Council. Shells rained on my
      head. Autocrat,

      Schweitzer,[10]
      bureaucrat, formalist,
      supercentre, one-sided, stiff-necked, obstinate, narrow-minded,
      suspicious, quarrelsome.... Very well, my friends! Have you
      finished? You have nothing more in reserve? Poor ammunition, I
      must say....


      Now comes my turn. Let us examine the content of the
      new Iskra’s new views on organisation and the relation
      of these views to that division of our Party into “majority” and
      “minority” the true character of which we have shown by our
      analysis of the debates and voting at the Second Congress.

      I shall not, of course, go into the tangle Martov created ovor
      this Central Committee ultimatum in his State of Siege
      by quoting private conversations and so on. This is the “second
      method of struggle”

 

I described in the previous section, which
      only a specialist in nervous disorders could hope to
      disentangle. It is enough to say that Comrade Martov insists
      that there was an agreement with the Central Committee not to
      publish the negotiations, which agreement has not been
      discovered to this day in spite of a most assiduous
      search. Comrade Travinsky, who conducted the negotiations on
      behalf of the Central Committee, informed me in writing that he
      considered me entitled to publish my letter to the editors
      outside of Iskra.


      But there was one phrase of Comrade Martov’s that I particularly
      liked. That was the phrase “Bonapartism of the worst type”. I
      find that Comrade Martov has brought in this category very
      appropriately. Let us examine dispassionately what the concept
      implies. In my opinion, it implies acquiring power by
      formally legal means, but actually in defiance
      of the will of the people (or of a party). Is that not so
      Comrade Martov? And if it is, then I may safely leave it to the
      public to judge who has been guilty of this “Bonapartism of the
      worst type”: Lenin and

Comrade Y[13], who might have availed themselves of
      their formal right not to admit the Martovites, but
      did not avail themselves of it, though in doing so they
      would have been backed by the will of the Second
      Congress—or those who occupied the editorial board by
      formally legitimate means (“unanimous co-optation”),
      but who knew that actually this was not in accordance with
      the will of the Second Congress and who are afraid to have
      this will tested at the Third Congress.

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: Q. The New Iskra.  Opportunism In Questions Of Organisation








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



Q. The New Iskra.

      
      Opportunism In Questions Of Organisation

      As the basis for an analysis of the principles of the new Iskra we
      should unquestionably take the two articles of Comrade

      Axelrod.[1]

The concrete meaning of
      some of his favourite catchwords has already been shown at length. Now

 

      we
      must try to leave their concrete meaning on one side and delve down to the
      line of thought that caused the “minority” to arrive (in connection with
      this or that minor and petty matter) at these particular slogans rather than
      any others, must examine the principles behind these slogans, irrespective
      of their origin, irrespective of the question of “co-optation”. Concessions
      are all the fashion nowadays, so let us make a concession to Comrade Axelrod
      and take his “theory” “seriously”.



      Comrade Axelrod’s basic thesis (Iskra , No 57) is that
      "from the very outset our movement harboured two opposite
      trends, whose mutual antagonism could not fail to develop and to
      affect the movement parallel with its own development". To be
      specific: “In principle, the proletarian aim of the movement [in
      Russia] is the same as that of western Social-Democracy.” But in
      our country the masses of the workers are influenced “by a
      social element alien to them”, namely, the radical
      intelligentsia. And so, Comrade Axelrod establishes the
      existence of an antagonism between the proletarian and the
      radical-intellectual trend in our Party.


      In this Comrade Axelrod is undoubtedly right. The existence of
      such an antagonism (and not in the Russian Social-Democratic
      Party alone) is beyond question. What is more, everyone knows
      that it is this antagonism that largely accounts for the
      division of present-day Social-Democracy into revolutionary
      (also known as orthodox) and opportunist (revisionist,
      ministerialist, reformist) Social-Democracy, which during the
      past ten years of our movement has become fully apparent in
      Russia too. Everyone also knows that the proletarian trend of
      the movement is expressed by orthodox Social-Democracy, while
      the trend of the democratic intelligentsia is expressed by
      opportunist Social-Democracy.


      But, after so closely approaching this piece of common
      knowledge, Comrade Axelrod begins timidly to back away from
      it. He does not make the slightest attempt to analyse
      how this division manifested itself in the history of Russian
      Social-Democracy in general, and at our Party Congress in
      particular, although it is about the Congress that he is
      writing! Like all the other editors of the new Iskra,

 

      Comrade Axelrod displays a mortal fear of the minutes
      of this Congress. This should not surprise us after all that has
      been said above, but in a “theoretician” who claims to be
      investigating the different trends in our movement it is
      certainly a queer case of truth-phobia. Backing away,
      because of this malady, from the latest and most accurate
      material on the trends in our movement, Comrade Axelrod seeks
      salvation in the sphere of pleasant daydreaming. He writes: “Has
      not legal Marxism, or semi-Marxism, provided our liberals with a
      literary leader? Why should not prankish history provide
      revolutionary bourgeois democracy with a leader from the school
      of orthodox, revolutionary Marxism?” All we can say about this
      daydream which Comrade Axelrod finds so pleasant is that if
      history does sometimes play pranks, that is no excuse for
      pranks of thought on the part of people who undertake
      to analyse history. When the liberal peeped out from under the
      cloak of the leader of semi-Marxism, those who wished (and
      were able) to trace his “trend” did not allude to possible
      pranks of history, but pointed to tens and hundreds of instances
      of that leader’s mentality and logic, to all those
      characteristics of his literary make-up which betrayed the
      reflection of Marxism in bourgeois

      literature.[15]
      And if Comrade
      Axelrod, setting out to analyse “the general-revolutionary and
      the proletarian trend in our movement”, could produce
      nothing, absolutely nothing, in proof or
      evidence that certain representatives of that orthodox wing of
      the Party which he so detests showed such and such a trend, he
      thereby issued a formal certificate of his own poverty.
      Comrade Axelrod’s case must be weak indeed if all he can do is
      allude to possible pranks of history!


      Comrade Axelrod’s other allusion—to the “Jacobins”—is
      still more revealing. Comrade Axelrod is probably aware that the
      division of present-day Social-Democracy into revolutionary and
      opportunist has long since given rise—and not only in
      Russia—to “historical parallels with the era of the great
      French Revolution”. Comrade Axelrod is probably aware that the
      Girondists of present-day Social-Democracy everywhere
      and always resort to the terms “Jacobinism”, “Blanquism”, and so
      on to describe their opponents. Let us then not imitate Comrade
      Axelrod’s truth-phobia,

 

      let us consult the minutes of our
      Congress and see whether they offer any material for an analysis
      and examination of the trends we are considering and the
      parallels we are discussing.


      First example: the Party Congress debate on the
      programme. Comrade Akimov (“fully agreeing” with Comrade
      Martynov) says: “The clause on the capture of political power
      [the dictatorship of the proletariat] has been formulated in
      such a way—as compared with the programmes of all other
      Social-Democratic parties—that it may be interpreted, and
      actually has been interpreted by Plekhanov, to mean that the
      role of the leading organisation will relegate to the background
      the class it is leading and separate the former from the
      latter. Consequently, the formulation of our political tasks is
      exactly the same as in the case of Narodnaya Volya.”
      (Minutes, p. 124.) Comrade Plekhanov and other
      Iskra-ists take issue with Comrade Akimov and accuse
      him of opportunism. Does not Comrade Axelrod find that this
      dispute shows us (in actual fact, and not in the imaginary
      pranks of history) the antagonism between the present-day
      Jacobins and the present-day Girondists of
      Social-Democracy? And was it not because he found himself in the
      company of the Girondists of Social-Democracy (owing to the
      mistakes he committed) that Comrade Axelrod began talking about
      Jacobins?


      Second example: Comrade Posadovsky declares that there is a
      “serious difference of opinion” over the “fundamental question”
      of “the absolute value of democratic principles”
      (p. 169). Together with Plekhanov, he denies their absolute
      value. The leaders of the “Centre” or Marsh (Egorov) and of the
      anti-Iskra-ists (Goldblatt) vehemently oppose this view
      and accuse Plekhanov of “imitating bourgeois tactics”
      (p. 170). This is exactly Comrade Axelrod’s idea of a
      connection between orthodoxy and the bourgeois trend, the
      only difference being that in Axelrod’s case it is vague and
      general, whereas Goldblatt linked it up with specific
      issues. Again we ask: does not Comrade Axelrod find that this
      dispute, too, shows us palpably, at our Party Congress,
      the antagonism between the Jacobins and the Girondists of
      present-day Social-Democracy? Is it not because he finds himself
      in the company of the Girondists

 

      that Comrade Axelrod raises
      this outcry against the Jacobins?


      Third example: the debate on Paragraph 1 of the Rules. Who is it
      that defends "the proletarian trend in our movement "?
      Who is it that insists that the worker is not afraid of
      organisation, that the proletarian has no sympathy for anarchy,
      that he values the incentive to organise? Who is it that warns
      us against the bourgeois intelligentsia, permeated through and
      through with opportunism? The Jacobins of
      Social-Democracy. And who is it that tries to smuggle
      radical intellectuals into the Party? Who is it that is
      concerned about professors, high-school students, free lances,
      the radical youth? The Girondist Axelrod together with the
      Girondist Lieber.


      How clumsily Comrade Axelrod defends himself against the “false
      accusation of opportunism” that at our Party Congress was openly
      levelled at the majority of the Emancipation of Labour group! By
      taking up the hackneyed Bernsteinian refrain about Jacobinism,
      Blanquism, and so on, he defends himself in a manner that only
      bears out the accusation! He shouts about the menace of the
      radical intellectuals in order to drown out his own speeches at
      the Party Congress, which were full of concern for these
      intellectuals.


      These “dreadful words”—Jacobinism and the rest—are
      expressive of opportunism and nothing else. A Jacobin
      who wholly identifies himself with the organisation of
      the proletariat—a proletariat conscious of its
      class interests—is a revolutionary
      Social-Democrat. A Girondist who sighs after professors and
      high-school students, who is afraid of the dictatorship of the
      proletariat, and who yearns for the absolute value of democratic
      demands is an opportunist. It is only opportunists who
      can still detect a danger in conspiratorial organisations today,
      when the idea of confining the political struggle to conspiracy
      has been refuted thousands of times in the press and has long
      been refuted and swept aside by the realities of life, and when
      the cardinal importance of mass political agitation has been
      elucidated and reiterated to the point of nausea. The real basis
      of this fear of conspiracy, of Blanquism, is not any feature to
      be found in the practical movement (as Bernstein and Co. have
      long, and vainly, been

 

      trying to make out), but the Girondist
      timidity of the bourgeois intellectual, whose mentality so often
      shows itself among the Social-Democrats of today. Nothing could
      be more comical than these laborious efforts of the new
      Iskra to utter a new word of warning (uttered
      hundreds of times before) against the tactics of the French
      conspirator revolutionaries of the forties and sixties (No. 62,

      editorial).[16]
      In the next issue of Iskra, the Girondists
      of present-day Social-Democracy will no doubt show us a group of
      French conspirators of the forties for whom the importance of
      political agitation among the working masses, the importance of
      the labour press as the principal means by which the party
      influences the class, was an elementary truth they had learned
      and assimilated long ago.


      However, the tendency of the new Iskra to repeat the
      elements and go back to the ABC while pretending to be uttering
      something new is not fortuitous; it is an inevitable consequence
      of the situation Axelrod and Martov find themselves in, now that
      they have landed in the opportunist wing of our Party. There is
      nothing for it. They have to repeat the opportunist phrases,
      they have to go back, in order to try to find in the
      remote past some sort of justification for their
      position, which is indefensible from the point of view of the
      struggle at the Congress and of the shades and divisions in the
      Party that took shape there.To the Akimovite profundities about
      Jacobinism and Blanquism, Comrade Axelrod adds Akimovite
      lamentations to the effect that not only the “Economists”, but
      the “politicians” as well, were “one-sided”, excessively
      “infatuated”, and so on and so forth. Reading the high-flown
      disquisitions on this subject in the new Iskra, which
      conceitedly claims to be above all this one-sidedness and
      infatuation, one asks in perplexity: whose portrait is it they
      are painting? where is it that they hear such

      talk?[17]
      Who does not
      know that the division of the Russian Social-Democrats into
      Economists and politicians has long been obsolete? Go through
      the files of Iskra for the last year or two before the
      Party Congress, and you will find that the fight against
      “Economism” subsided and came to an end altogether as far back
      as 1902; you will find, for example, that in July 1903 (No. 43),
      “the times of Economism” are spoken of as

 

      being “definitely
      over”, Economism is considered “dead and buried”, and any
      infatuations of the politicians are regarded as obvious
      atavism. Why, then, do the new editors of Iskra revert
      to this dead and buried division? Did we fight the Akimovs at
      the Congress on account of the mistakes they made in
      Rabocheye Dyelo two years ago? If we had, we should
      have been sheer idiots. But everyone knows that we did not, that
      it was not for their old, dead and buried mistakes in
      Rabocheye Dyelo that we fought the Akimovs at the
      Congress, but for the new mistakes they committed in their
      arguments and their voting at the Congress. It was not by their
      stand in Rabocheye Dyelo, but by their stand at the
      Congress, that we judged which mistakes were really a thing of
      the past and which still lived and called for controversy. By
      the time of the Congress the old division into Economists and
      politicians no longer existed; but various opportunist trends
      continued to exist. They found expression in the debates and
      voting on a number of issues, and finally led to a new division
      of the Party into “majority” and “minority”. The whole point is
      that the new editors of Iskra are, for obvious reasons,
      trying to gloss over the connection between this new division
      and contemporary opportunism in our Party, and are, in
      consequence, compelled to go back from the new division to the
      old one. Their inability to explain the political origin of the
      new division (or their desire, in order to prove how
      accommodating they are, to cast a

 veil[2]
[2]
See Plekhanov’s article on “Economism” in No. 53 of Iskra. The
subtitle of the article appears to contain a slight misprint. Instead of
“Reflections on the Second Party Congress”, it should apparently read, “on
the League Congress”, or even “on Co-optation”. However
appropriate concessions to personal claims may be under certain
circumstances, it is quite inadmissible (from the Party, not the philistine
standpoint) to confuse the issues that are agitating the Party and to
substitute for the new mistake of Martov and Axelrod, who have begun to
swing from orthodoxy towards opportunism, the old mistake (never recalled
today by anyone except the new Iskra) of the Martynovs and
Akimovs, who perhaps may now be prepared to swing from opportunism towards
orthodoxy on many questions of programme and tactics.  —Lenin


      over its origin) compels
      them to keep harping on a division that has long been
      obsolete. Everyone knows that the new division is based on a
      difference over questions of


organisation, which began
      with the controversy over principles of organisation (Paragraph
      1 of the Rules) and ended up with a “practice” worthy of
      anarchists. The old division into Economists and politicians was
      based mainly on a difference over questions of tactics.


      In its efforts to justify this retreat from the more complex,
      truly topical and burning issues of Party life to issues that
      have long been settled and have now been dug up artificially,
      the new Iskra resorts to an amusing display of
      profundity for which there can be no other name than
      tail-ism. Started by Comrade Axelrod, there runs like a crimson
      thread through all the writing of the new Iskra the
      profound “idea” that content is more important than form, that
      programme and tactics are more important than organisation, that
      “the vitality of an organisation is in direct proportion to the
      volume and value of the content it puts into the movement”, that
      centralism is not an “end in itself”, not an “all-saving
      talisman”, etc., etc. Great and profound truths! The programme
      is indeed more important than tactics, and tactics more
      important than organisation. The alphabet is more important than
      etymology, and etymology more important than syntax—but
      what would we say of people who, after failing in an examination
      in syntax, went about pluming and priding themselves on being
      left in a lower class far another year? Comrade Axelrod argued
      about principles of organisation like an opportunist (Paragraph
      1), and behaved inside the organisation like an anarchist
      (League Congress)—and now he is trying to render
      Social-Democracy more profound. Sour grapes! What is
      organisation, properly speaking? Why, it is only a form. What is
      centralism? After all, it is not a talisman. What is syntax?
      Why, it is less important than etymology; it is only the form of
      combining the elements of etymology.... “Will not Comrade
      Alexandrov agree with us,” the new editors of Iskra
      triumphantly ask, “when we say that the Congress did much more
      for the centralisation of Party work by drawing up a Party
      programme than by adopting Rules, however perfect the latter may
      seem?” (No. 56, Supplement.) It is to be hoped that this
      classical utterance will acquire a historic fame no less wide
      and no less lasting than Comrade Krichevsky’s celebrated remark
      that

 

      Social-Democracy, like mankind, always sets itself only
      such tasks as it can perform. For the new Iskra’s piece
      of profundity is of exactly the same stamp. Why was Comrade
      Krichevsky’s phrase held up to derision? Because he tried to
      justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Democrats in
      matters of tactics—their inability to set correct political
      tasks—by a commonplace which he wanted to palm off as
      philosophy. In exactly the same way the new Iskra tries
      to justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Democrats in
      matters of organisation—the intellectualist instability of
      certain comrades, which has led them to the point of anarchistic
      phrase-mongering—by the commonplace that the programme is
      more important than the Rules, that questions of programme are
      more important than questions of organisation! What is this but
      tail-ism? What is it but pluming oneself on having been left in
      a lower class for another year?


      The adoption of a programme contributes more to the
      centralisation of the work than the adoption of Rules. How this
      commonplace, palmed off as philosophy, reeks of the mentality of
      the radical intellectual, who has much more in common with
      bourgeois decadence than with Social-Democracy! Why, the word
      centralisation is used in this famous phrase in a sense that is
      nothing but symbolical. If the authors of the phrase
      are unable or disinclined to think, they might at least have
      recalled the simple fact that the adoption of a programme
      together with the Bundists, far from leading to the
      centralisation of our common work, did not even save us from a
      split. Unity on questions of programme and tactics is an
      essential but by no means a sufficient condition for Party
      unity, for the centralisation of Party work (good God, what
      elementary things one has to spell out nowadays, when all
      concepts have been confused!). The latter requires, in addition,
      unity of organisation, which, in a party that has grown to be
      anything more than a mere family circle, is inconceivable
      without formal Rules, without the subordination of the minority
      to the majority and of the part to the whole. As long as we had
      no unity on the fundamental questions of programme and tactics,
      we bluntly admitted that we were living in a period of disunity
      and separate circles, we bluntly declared that before we could
      unite, lines of demarcation must be drawn; we did

 

      not even talk
      of the forms of a joint organisation, but exclusively discussed
      the new (at that time they really were new) problems of fighting
      opportunism on programme and tactics. At present, as we all
      agree, this fight has already produced a sufficient degree of
      unity, as formulated in the Party programme and the Party
      resolutions on tactics; we had to take the next step, and, by
      common consent, we did take it, working out the forms
      of a united organisation that would merge all the circles
      together. But now these forms have been half destroyed and we
      have been dragged back, dragged back to anarchistic conduct, to
      anarchistic phrases, to the revival of a circle in place of a
      Party editorial board. And this step back is being justified on
      the plea that the alphabet is more helpful to literate speech
      than a knowledge of syntax!


      The philosophy of tail-ism, which flourished three years ago in
      questions of tactics, is being resurrected today in relation to
      questions of organisation. Take the following argument of the
      new editors. “The militant Social-Democratic trend in the
      Party,” says Comrade Alexandrov, “should be maintained not only
      by an ideological struggle, but by definite forms of
      organisation.” Whereupon the editors edifyingly remark: “Not
      bad, this juxtaposition of ideological struggle and forms of
      organisation. The ideological struggle is a process, whereas the
      forms of organisation are only . . . forms [believe it or not,
      that is what they say—No. 56, Supplement, p. 4, bottom of
      col. 1!] designed to clothe a fluid and developing
      content—the developing practical work of the Party.” That
      is positively in the style of the joke about a cannon-ball being
      a cannon-ball and a bomb a bomb! The ideological struggle is a
      process, whereas the forms of organisation are only forms
      clothing the content! The point at issue is whether our
      ideological struggle is to have forms of a higher type
      to clothe it, the forms of a party organisation, binding on all,
      or the forms of the old disunity and the old circles. We have
      been dragged back from higher to more primitive forms, and this
      is being justified on the plea that the ideological struggle is
      a process, whereas forms—are only forms. That is just how
      Comrade Krichevsky in bygone days tried to drag us back from
      tactics-as-a-plan to tactics-as-a-process.



      Take the new Iskra’s pompous talk about the
      “self-training of the proletariat”, directed against those who
      are supposed to be in danger of missing the content because of
      the form (No. 58, editorial). Is this not Akimovism No. 2?
      Akimovism No. 1 justified the backwardness of a section of the
      Social-Democratic intelligentsia in formulating tactical tasks
      by talking about the more “profound” content of “the proletarian
      struggle” and the self-training of the proletariat. Akimovism
      No. 2 justifies the backwardness of a section of the
      Social-Democratic intelligentsia in the theory and practice of
      organisation by equally profound talk about organisation being
      merely a form and the self-training of the proletariat the
      important thing. Let me tell you gentlemen who are so solicitous
      about the younger brother that the proletariat is not afraid of
      organisation and discipline! The proletariat will do nothing to
      have the worthy professors and high-school students who do not
      want to join an organisation recognised as Party members merely
      because they work under the control of an organisation. The
      proletariat is trained for organisation by its whole life, far
      more radically than many an intellectual prig. Having gained
      some understanding of our programme and our tactics, the
      proletariat will not start justifying backwardness in
      organisation by arguing that the form is less important than the
      content. It is not the proletariat, but certain
      intellectuals in our Party who lack self-training
      in the spirit of organisation and discipline, in the spirit of
      hostility and contempt for anarchistic talk. When they say that
      it is not ripe for organisation, the Akimovs No. 2 libel the
      proletariat just as the Akimovs No. 1 libelled it when they said
      that it was not ripe for the political struggle. The proletarian
      who has become a conscious Social-Democrat and feels himself a
      member of the Party will reject tail-ism in matters of
      organisation with the same contempt as he rejected tail-ism in
      matters of tactics.


      Finally, consider the profound wisdom of the new
      Iskra’s “Practical Worker”. “Properly understood,” he
      says, “the idea of a ’militant’ centralist organisation uniting
      and centralising the revolutionaries’ activities [the
      italics are to make it look more profound] can only materialise
      naturally if such activities exist [both new and
      clever!]; organisation

 

      itself, being a form [mark that!], can
      only grow simultaneously [the
      italics are the author’s, as throughout this quotation]
      with the growth of the revolutionary work which is its content.”
      (No. 57.) Does not this remind you very much of the character in
      the folktale who, on seeing a funeral, cried: “Many happy
      returns of the day”? I am sure there is not a practical worker
      (in the genuine sense of the term) in our Party who does not
      understand that it is precisely the form of our activities
      (i.e., our organisation) that has long been lagging, and lagging
      desperately, behind their content, and that only the Simple
      Simons in the Party could shout to people who are lagging: "Keep
      in line; don’t run ahead !" Compare our Party, let us say, with
      the Bund. There can be no question but that the

      content[3]
[3]
      I leave quite aside the fact that the content of our
      Party work was mapped out at the Congress (in the programme,
      etc.) in the spirit of revolutionary Social-Democracy only
      at the cost of a struggle, a struggle against those
      very anti-Iskra-ists and that very Marsh whose
      representatives numerically predominate in our “minority”. On
      this question of “content” it would be interesting also to
      compare, let us say, six issues of the old Iskra
      (Nos. 46-51) with twelve issues of the new Iskra
      (Nos. 52-63). But that will have to wait for some other time.
    —Lenin


      of the work of our Party is
      immeasurably richer, more varied, broader, and deeper than is
      the case with the Bund. The scope of our theoretical views is
      wider, our programme more developed, our influence among the
      mass of the workers (and not merely among the organised
      artisans) broader and deeper, our propaganda and agitation more
      varied; the pulse of the political work of both leaders and rank
      and file is more lively, the popular movements during
      demonstrations and general strikes more impressive, and our work
      among the non-proletarian strata more energetic. But the “form”?
      Compared with the Bund’s, the “form” of our work is lagging
      unpardonably, lagging so that it is an eyesore and brings a
      blush of shame to the cheeks of anyone who does not merely “pick
      his teeth” when contemplating the affairs of his Party. The fact
      that the organisation of our work lags behind its content is our
      weak point, and it was our weak point long before the Congress,
      long before the Organising Committee was formed. The lame and
      undeveloped character of the form makes any serious step in the
      further development

 

      of the content impossible; it causes a
      shameful stagnation, leads to a waste of energy, to a
      discrepancy between word and deed. We have all been suffering
      wretchedly from this discrepancy, yet along come the Axelrods
      and “Practical Workers” of the new Iskra with their
      profound precept: the form must grow naturally, only
      simultaneously with the content!


      That is where a small mistake on the question of organisation
      (Paragraph 1) will lead you if you try to lend
      profundity to nonsense and to find philosophical
      justification for opportunist talk. Marching slowly, in timid

      zigzags![18]—we
      have heard this refrain in relation to
      questions of tactics; we are hearing it again in relation to
      questions of organisation. Tail-ism in questions of
      organisation is a natural and inevitable product of the
      mentality of the anarchistic individualist when he
      starts to elevate his anarchistic deviations (which at the
      outset may have been accidental) to a system of views, to
      special differences of principle. At the League
      Congress we witnessed the beginnings of this anarchism; in the
      new Iskra we are witnessing attempts to elevate it to a
      system of views. These attempts strikingly confirm what was
      already said at the Party Congress about the difference between
      the points of view of the bourgeois intellectual who attaches
      himself to the Social-Democratic movement and the proletarian
      who has become conscious of his class interests. For instance,
      this same “Practical Worker” of the new Iskra with
      whose profundity we are already familiar denounces me for
      visualising the Party “as an immense factory” headed by a
      director in the shape of the Central Committee (No. 57,
      Supplement). “Practical Worker” never guesses that this dreadful
      word of his immediately betrays the mentality of the bourgeois
      intellectual unfamiliar with either the practice or the theory
      of proletarian organisation. For the factory, which seems only a
      bogey to some, represents that highest form of capitalist
      co-operation which has united and disciplined the proletariat,
      taught it to organise, and placed it at the head of all the
      other sections of the toiling and exploited population. And
      Marxism, the ideology of the proletariat trained by capitalism,
      has been and is teaching unstable intellectuals to distinguish
      between the factory as a means of exploitation (discipline based
      on fear of starvation) and the factory as a means of
      organisation (discipline

 

      based on collective work united by the
      conditions of a technically highly developed form of
      production). The discipline and organisation which come so hard
      to the bourgeois intellectual are very easily acquired by the
      proletariat just because of this factory “schooling”. Mortal
      fear of this school and utter failure to understand its
      importance as an organising factor are characteristic of the
      ways of thinking which reflect the petty-bourgeois mode of life
      and which give rise to the species of anarchism that the German
      Social-Democrats call Edelanarchismus, that is, the
      anarchism of the “noble” gentleman, or aristocratic anarchism,
      as I would call it. This aristocratic anarchism is particularly
      characteristic of the Russian nihilist. He thinks of the Party
      organisation as a monstrous “factory”; he regards the
      subordination of the part to the whole and of the minority to
      the majority as “serfdom” (see Axelrod’s articles); division of
      labour under the direction of a centre evokes from him a
      tragi-comical outcry against transforming people into “cogs and
      wheels” (to turn editors into contributors being considered a
      particularly atrocious species of such transformation); mention
      of the organisational Rules of the Party calls forth a
      contemptuous grimace and the disdainful remark (intended for the
      “formalists”) that one could very well dispense with Rules
      altogether.


      Incredible as it may seem, it was a didactic remark of just this
      sort that Comrade Martov addressed to me in Iskra,
      No. 58, quoting, for greater weight, my own words inA Letter
      to a Comrade. Well, what is it if not “aristocratic
      anarchism” and tail-ism to cite examples from the era of
      disunity, the era of the circles, to justify the
      preservation and glorification of the circle spirit and anarchy
      in the era of the Party?


      Why did we not need Rules before? Because the Party consisted of
      separate circles without any organisational tie between
      them. Any individual could pass from one circle to another at
      his own “sweet will”, for he was not faced with any formulated
      expression of the will of the whole. Disputes within the circles
      were not settled according to Rules, "but by struggle and
      threats to resign ", as I put it in A Letter to a

    Comrade,[4]

summarising the experience
      of a

 

      number of circles in general and of our own editorial
      circle of six in particular. In the era of the circles, this was
      natural and inevitable, but it never occurred to anybody to
      extol it, to regard it as ideal; everyone complained of the
      disunity, everyone was distressed by it and eager to see the
      isolated circles fused into a formally constituted party
      organisation. And now that this fusion has taken place, we are
      being dragged back and, under the guise of higher organisational
      views, treated to anarchistic phrase-mongering! To people
      accustomed to the loose dressing-gown and slippers of the

      Oblomov[19]
      circle domesticity, formal Rules seem narrow,
      restrictive, irksome, mean, and bureaucratic, a bond of serfdom
      and a fetter on the free “process” of the ideological
      struggle. Aristocratic anarchism cannot understand that formal
      Rules are needed precisely in order to replace the narrow circle
      ties by the broad Party tie. It was unnecessary and impossible
      to give formal shape to the internal ties of a circle or the
      ties between circles, for these ties rested on personal
      friendship or on an instinctive “confidence” for which no reason
      was given. The Party tie cannot and must not rest on either of
      these; it must be founded on formal, “bureaucratically”
      worded Rules (bureaucratic from the standpoint of the
      undisciplined intellectual), strict adherence to which can alone
      safeguard us from the wilfulness and caprices characteristic of
      the circles, from the circle wrangling that goes by the name of
      the free “process” of the ideological struggle.


      The editors of the new Iskra try to trump Alexandrov
      with the didactic remark that “confidence is a delicate thing
      and cannot be hammered into people’s hearts and minds” (No. 56,
      Supplement). The editors do not realise that by this talk about
      confidence, naked confidence, they are once more
      betraying their aristocratic anarchism and organisational
      tail-ism. When I was a member of a circle only—whether it
      was the circle of the six editors or the Iskra
      organisation—I was entitled to justify my refusal, say, to
      work with X merely on the grounds of lack of confidence, without
      stating reason or motive. But now that I have become a member of
      a party, I have no right to plead lack of confidence in
      general, for that would throw open the doors to all the freaks
      and whims of the old circles; I am obliged to give
      formal reasons

 

      for my “confidence” or “lack of confidence”, that
      is, to cite a formally established principle of our programme,
      tactics or Rules; I must not just declare my “confidence” or
      “lack of confidence” without giving reasons, but must
      acknowledge that my decisions—and generally all decisions
      of any section of the Party—have to be accounted
      for to the whole Party; I am obliged to adhere to a
      formally prescribed procedure when giving expression to
      my “lack of confidence” or trying to secure the acceptance of
      the views and wishes that follow from this lack of
      confidence. From the circle view that “confidence” does
      not have to be accounted for, we have already risen to the
      Party view which demands adherence to a formally
      prescribed procedure of expressing, accounting for, and
      testing our confidence; but the editors try to drag us
      back, and call their tail-ism new views on organisation!


      Listen to the way our so-called Party editors talk about
      writers’ groups that might demand representation on the
      editorial board. “We shall not get indignant and begin to shout
      about discipline”, we are admonished by these aristocratic
      anarchists who have always and everywhere looked down on such a
      thing as discipline. We shall either “arrange the matter”
      (sic!) with the group, if it is sensible, or just laugh
      at its demands.


      Dear me, what a lofty and noble rebuff to vulgar “factory”
      formalism! But in reality it is the old circle phraseology
      furbished up a little and served up to the Party by an editorial
      board which feels that it is not a Party institution, but the
      survival of an old circle. The intrinsic falsity of this
      position inevitably leads to the anarchistic profundity
      of elevating the disunity they hypocritically proclaim to be
      past and gone to a principle of Social-Democratic
      organisation. There is no need for any hierarchy of higher and
      lower Party bodies and authorities—aristocratic anarchism
      regards such a hierarchy as the bureaucratic invention of
      ministries, departments, etc. (see Axelrod’s article); there is
      no need for the part to submit to the whole; there is no need
      for any “formal bureaucratic” definition of Party
      methods of “arranging matters” or of delimiting differences. Let
      the old circle wrangling be sanctified by pompous talk about
      “genuinely Social-Democratic” methods of organisation.



      This is where the proletarian who has been through the school of
      the “factory” can and should teach a lesson to anarchistic
      individualism. The class-conscious worker has long since emerged
      from the state of infancy when he used to fight shy of the
      intellectual as such. The class-conscious worker appreciates the
      richer store of knowledge and the wider political outlook which
      he finds among Social-Democratic intellectuals. But as we
      proceed with the building of a real party, the
      class-conscious worker must learn to distinguish the mentality
      of the soldier of the proletarian army from the mentality of the
      bourgeois intellectual who parades anarchistic phrases; he must
      learn to insist that the duties of a Party member be
      fulfilled not only by the rank and file, but by the “people at
      the top” as well; he must learn to treat tail-ism in matters of
      organisation with the same contempt as he used, in days gone by,
      to treat tail-ism in matters of tactics!


      Inseparably connected with Girondism and aristocratic anarchism
      is the last characteristic feature of the new Iskra’s
      attitude towards matters of organisation, namely, its defence of
      autonomism as against centralism. This is the meaning
      in principle (if it has any such

       meaning[5]
[5]
I leave aside here, as in this section generally, the “co-optational”
meaning of this outcry. —Lenin


)

      of its
      outcry against bureaucracy and autocracy, of its regrets about “an
      undeserved disregard for the non-Iskra-ists” (who defended
      autonomism at the Congress), of its comical howls about a demand for
      “unquestioning obedience”, of its bitter complaints of “Jack-in-office
      rule”, etc., etc. The opportunist wing of any party always defends and
      justifies all backwardness, whether in programme, tactics, or
      organisation. The new Iskra’s defence of backwardness in
      organisation (its tail-ism) is closely connected with the defence of
      autonomism. True, autonomism has, generally speaking, been so
      discredited already by the three years’ propaganda work of the old
      Iskra that the new Iskra is ashamed, as yet, to
      advocate it openly; it still assures us of its sympathy for centralism, but
      shows it only by printing the word centralism in italics. Actually, it is
      enough to apply the slightest touch of criticism to the “principles” of the
      “genuinely Social-Democratic” (not anarchistic?) quasi-centralism of the new
      Iskra
 

      for the autonomist standpoint to be detected
      at every step. Is it not now clear to all and sundry that on the
      subject of organisation Axelrod and Martov have swung over to
      Akimov? Have they not solemnly admitted it themselves in the
      significant words, “undeserved disregard for the
      non-Iskra-ists”? And what was it but autonomism that
      Akimov and his friends defended at our Party Congress?


      It was autonomism (if not anarchism) that Martov and Axelrod
      defended at the League Congress when, with amusing zeal, they
      tried to prove that the part need not submit to the whole, that
      the part is autonomous in defining its relation to the whole,
      that the Rules of the League, in which that relation is
      formulated, are valid in defiance of the will of the Party
      majority, in defiance of the will of the Party centre. And it is
      autonomism that Comrade Martov is now openly defending in the
      columns of the new Iskra (No. 60) in the matter of the
      right of the Central Committee to appoint members to the local
      committees. I shall not speak of the puerile sophistries which
      Comrade Martov used to defend autonomism at the League Congress,
      and is still using in the new

      Iskra[6]
[6]
      In enumerating various paragraphs of the Rules, Comrade Martov
      omitted the one which deals with the relation of the
      whole to the part: the Central Committee “allocates the Party
      forces” (Paragraph 6). Can one allocate forces without
      transferring people from one committee to another? It is
      positively awkward to have to dwell on such elementary things.
    —Lenin


—the

      important thing here is to note the undoubted tendency to
      defend autonomism against centralism, which is a
      fundamental characteristic of opportunism in matters of
      organisation.


      Perhaps the only attempt to analyse the concept bureaucracy is
      the distinction drawn in the new Iskra (No. 53) between
      the “formal democratic principle” (author’s italics)
      and the “formal bureaucratic principle”. This
      distinction (which, unfortunately, was no more developed or
      explained than the reference to the non-Iskra-ists)
      contains a grain of truth. Bureaucracy versus democracy
      is in fact centralism versus autonomism; it is the
      organisational principle of revolutionary Social-Democracy as
      opposed to the organisational principle of opportunist
      Social-Democracy. The latter strives to proceed from the bottom
      upward, and,

 

      therefore, wherever possible and as far as
      possible, upholds autonomism and “democracy”, carried (by the
      overzealous) to the point of anarchism. The former strives to
      proceed from the top downward, and upholds an extension of the
      rights and powers of the centre in relation to the parts. In the
      period of disunity and separate circles, this top from which
      revolutionary Social-Democracy strove to proceed
      organisationally was inevitably one of the circles, the one
      enjoying most influence by virtue of its activity and its
      revolutionary consistency (in our case, the Iskra
      organisation). In the period of the restoration of actual Party
      unity and dissolution of the obsolete circles in this unity,
      this top is inevitably the Party Congress, as the
      supreme organ of the Party; the Congress as far as possible
      includes representatives of all the active organisations, and,
      by appointing the central institutions (often with a membership
      which satisfies the advanced elements of the Party more than the
      backward and is more to the taste of its revolutionary than its
      opportunist wing), makes them the top until the next
      Congress. Such, at any rate, is the case among the
      Social-Democratic Europeans, although little by little this
      custom, so abhorrent in principle to anarchists, is beginning to
      spread—not without difficulty and not without conflicts and
      squabbles—to the Social-Democratic Asiatics.


      It is highly interesting to note that these fundamental
      characteristics of opportunism in matters of organisation
      (autonomism, aristocratic or intellectualist anarchism,
      tail-ism, and Girondism) are, mutatis mutandis (with
      appropriate modifications), to be observed in all the
      Social-Democratic parties in the world, wherever there is a
      division into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing (and where
      is there not?). Only quite recently this was very strikingly
      revealed in the German Social-Democratic Party, when its defeat
      at the elections in the 20th electoral division of Saxony (known
      as the Göhre

      incident[7]
[7]
      Göhre was returned to the Reichstag on June 16, 1903, from
      the 15th division of Saxony, but after the Dresden

      Congress[22]
      he resigned his seat. The electorate of the 20th division, which had fallen
      vacant on the death of Rosenow, wanted to put forward Göhre as
      candidate. The Central Party Executive and the Regional Party Executive for
      Saxony opposed this, and while they had no formal

 

right to forbid
      Göhre’s nomination, they succeeded in getting him to decline. The
      Social-Democrats were defeated at the polls.
    —Lenin


)

brought the question of the


principles of party organisation to the fore. That this
      incident should have become an issue of principle was largely
      due to the zeal of the German opportunists. Gohre (an ex-parson,
      author of the fairly well-known book Drei Monate

      Fabrikarbeiter,[8]

and one of the
      “heroes” of the Dresden Congress) is himself an extreme
      opportunist, and the Sozialistische Monatshefte
(Socialist

Monthly,)[20]
      the organ of the consistent German
      opportunists, at once “took up the cudgels” on his behalf.


      Opportunism in programme is naturally connected with opportunism
      in tactics and opportunism in organisation. The exposition of
      the “new” point of view was undertaken by Comrade Wolfgang
      Heine. To give the reader some idea of ithe political complexion
      of this typical intellectual, who on joining the
      Social-Democratic movement brought with him opportunist habits
      of thought, it is enough to say that Comrade Wolfgang Heine is
      something less than a German Comrade Akimov and something more
      than a German Comrade Egorov.


      Comrade Wolfgang Heine took the field in the Sozialistische
      Monatshefte with no less pomp than Comrade Axelrod in the
      new Iskra. The very title of his article is priceless:
      “Democratic Observations on the Göhre Incident”
      (Sozialistische Monatshefte, No. 4, April). The
      contents are no less thunderous. Comrade W. Heine rises up in
      arms against “encroachments on the autonomy of the
      constituency”, champions “the democratic principle”, and
      protests against the interference of an “appointed authority”
      (i.e., the Central Party Executive) in the free election of
      deputies by the people. The point at issue, Comrade W. Heine
      admonishes us, is not a random incident, but a general
      "tendency towards bureaucracy and centralism in the
      Party ", a tendency, he says, which was to be observed
      before, but which is now becoming particularly dangerous. It
      must be “recognised as a principle that the local institutions
      of the Party are the vehicles of Party life” (a plagiarism on
      Comrade Martov’s pamphlet Once More in the Minority). We
      must not “accustom ourselves to having all important political
      decisions

 

      come from one centre”, and must warn the
      Party against “a doctrinaire policy which loses contact with
      life” (borrowed from Comrade Martov’s speech at the Party
      Congress to the effect that “life will assert
      itself”). Rendering his argument more profound, Comrade W. Heine
      says: “. . . If we go down to the roots of the matter and leave
      aside personal conflicts, which here, as everywhere, have played
      no small part, this bitterness against the revisionists
      [the italics are the author’s and evidently hint at a
      distinction between fighting revisionism and fighting
      revisionists] will be found to be mainly expressive of the
      distrust of the Party officialdom for ’outsiders’
      [W. Heine had apparently not yet read the pamphlet about
      combating the state of siege, and therefore resorted to an
      Anglicism—Outsidertum ], the distrust of tradition
      for the unusual, of the impersonal institution for everything
      individual [see Axelrod’s resolution at the League Congress on
      the suppression of individual initiative]—in short, of that
      tendency which we have defined above as a tendency towards
      bureaucracy and centralism in the Party.”


      The idea of “discipline” inspires Comrade W. Heine with a no
      less noble disgust than Comrade Axelrod.... “The
      revisionists,” he writes, “have been accused of lack of
      discipline for having written for the Sozialistische
      Monatshefte, an organ whose Social-Democratic character has
      even been denied because it is not controlled by the
      Party. This very attempt to narrow down the concept
      ’Social-Democratic’, this insistence on discipline in
      the sphere of ideological production, where absolute freedom
      should prevail [remember: the ideological struggle is a process
      whereas the forms of organisation are only forms], demonstrates
      the tendency towards bureaucracy and the suppression of
      individuality.” And W. Heine goes on and on, fulminating against
      this detestable tendency to create “one big
      all-embracing organisation, as centralised as possible,
      one set of tactics, and one theory”, against
      the demand for “implicit obedience”, “blind submission”, against
      “oversimplified centralism”, etc., etc., literally “à
      la Axelrod”.


      The controversy started by W. Heine spread, and as there were no
      squabbles about co-optation in the German Party to obscure that
      issue, and as the German Akimovs display their complexion not
      only at congresses, but all the time, in

 

      a periodical of their
      own, the argument soon boiled down to an analysis of the
      principles of the orthodox and revisionist trends on the
      question of organisation. Karl Kautsky came forward (in the
      Neue Zeit, 1904, No. 28, in the article "Wahlkreis
und Partei "—“Constituency and Party”) as one of the
      spokesmen of the revolutionary trend (which, exactly as in our
      Party, was of course accused of “dictatorship”, “inquisitorial”
      tendencies, and other dreadful things). W. Heine’s article, he
      says, “expresses the line of thought of the whole revisionist
      trend”. Not only in Germany, but in France and Italy as well,
      the opportunists are all staunch supporters of autonomism, of a
      slackening of Party discipline, of reducing it to naught;
      everywhere their tendencies lead to disorganisation and
      to perverting “the democratic principle” into
      anarchism. “Democracy does not mean absence of
      authority,” Karl Kautsky informs the opportunists on the subject
      of organisation, “democracy does not mean anarchy; it means the
      rule of the masses over their representatives, in distinction to
      other forms of rule, where the supposed servants of the people
      are in reality their masters.” Kautsky traces at length the
      disruptive role played by opportunist autonomism in various
      countries; he shows that it is precisely the influx of “a
great number of bourgeois

elements”[9]
[9]
Kautsky mentions Jaurès
as an example. The more these people deviated towards opportunism, the
more “they were bound to consider Party discipline an impermissible
constraint on their free personality”. —Lenin


      into the Social-Democratic movement that is strengthening
      opportunism, autonomism, and the tendency to violate discipline;
      and once more he reminds us that “organisation is the weapon
      that will emancipate the proletariat”, that “organisation is the
      characteristic weapon of the proletariat in the class
      struggle”.


      In Germany, where opportunism is weaker than in France or Italy,
      "autonomist tendencies have so far led only to more or less
      passionate declamations against dictators and grand inquisitors,
      against

      excommunication[10]
[10]
Bannstrahl: excommunication. This is the German equivalent of the
Russian “state of siege” and “emergency laws”. It is the “dreadful word”
      of the German opportunists. —Lenin


      and heresy-hunting, and to
      endless cavilling and squabbling, which would only result in
      endless strife if replied to by the other side”.



      It is not surprising that in Russia, where opportunism in the
      Party is even weaker than in Germany, autonomist tendencies
      should have produced fewer ideas and more “passionate
      declamations” and squabbling.


      It is not surprising that Kautsky arrives at the following
      conclusion: “There is perhaps no other question on which
      revisionism in all countries, despite its multiplicity of form
      and hue, is so alike as on the question of organisation.”
      Kautsky, too, defines the basic tendencies of orthodoxy and
      revisionism in this sphere with the help of the “dreadful word”:
      bureaucracy versus democracy. We are told, he says,
      that to give the Party leadership the right to influence the
      selection of candidates (for parliament) by the constituencies
      is “a shameful encroachment on the democratic principle, which
      demands that all political activity proceed from the bottom
      upward, by the independent activity of the masses, and not from
      the top downward, in a bureaucratic way.... But if there is
      any democratic principle, it is that the majority must have
      predominance over the minority, and not the other way
      round....” The election of a member of parliament by any
      constituency is an important matter for the Party as a whole,
      which should influence the nomination of candidates, if only
      through its representatives (Vertrauensmanner
      ). “Whoever considers this too bureaucratic or centralistic let
      him suggest that candidates be nominated by the direct vote of
      the Party membership at large [sīmtliche
      Parteigenossen ]. If he thinks this is not practicable, he
      must not complain of a lack of democracy when this function,
      like many others that concern the Party as a whole, is exercised
      by one or several Party bodies.” It has long been “common law”
      in the German Party for constituencies to “come to a friendly
      understanding” with the Party leadership about the choice of
      candidates. “But the Party has grown too big for this tacit
      common law to suffice any longer. Common law ceases to be law
      when it ceases to be accepted as a matter of course, when its
      stipulations, and even its very existence, are called in
      question. Then it becomes necessary to formulate the law
      specifically, to codify it” . . . to go over to more "precise
      statutory

      definition[11]
[11]
      It is highly instructive to compare these remarks of Kautsky’s
      about the replacement of a tacitly recognised common law by a

 

formally deflned statutory law with that whole “change-over”
      which our Party in general, and the editorial board in
      particular, have been undergoing since the Party
      Congress. Cf. the speech of V. I. Zasulich (at the League
      Congress, p. 66 et seq.), who does not seem to realise the full
      significance of this change-over.
    —Lenin

 

[statutarische Festlegung]

 

      and, accordingly, greater strictness [grössere
      Straffheit ] of organisation”.


      Thus you have, in a different environment, the same struggle
      between the opportunist and the revolutionary wing of the Party
      on the question of organisation, the same conflict between
      autonomism and centralism, between democracy and “bureaucracy”,
      between the tendency to relax and the tendency to tighten
      organisation and discipline, between the mentality of the
      unstable intellectual and that of the staunch proletarian,
      between intellectualist individualism and proletarian
      solidarity. What, one asks, was the attitude to this conflict of
      bourgeois democracy—not the bourgeois democracy
      which prankish history has only promised in private to show to
      Comrade Axelrod some day, but the real and actual bourgeois
      democracy which in Germany has spokesmen no less shrewd and
      observant than our own gentlemen of Osvobozhdeniye?
      German bourgeois democracy at once reacted to the new
      controversy, and—like Russian bourgeois democracy, like
      bourgeois democracy everywhere and always—sided solidly
      with the opportunist wing of the Social-Democratic Party. The
      Frankfurter Zeitung, leading organ of the German stock
      exchange, published a thunderous editorial (Frankfurter
      Zeitung, April 7, 1904, No. 97, evening edition) which
      shows that shameless plagiarising of Axelrod is becoming a
      veritable disease with the German press. The stern democrats of
      the Frankfort stock exchange lash out furiously at the
      “absolutism” in the Social-Democratic Party, at the “party
      dictatorship”, at the “autocratic rule of the Party
      authorities”, at the “interdicts” which are intended
      “concurrently to chastise revisionism as a whole” (recall the
      “false accusation of opportunism”), at the insistence on “blind
      obedience”, “deadening discipline”, “servile subordination”, and
      the transforming of Party members into “political corpses” (that
      is a good bit stronger than cogs and wheels!). “All
      distinctiveness of personality”, the knights of the stock

 

      exchange indignantly exclaim at the sight of the undemocratic
      regime among the Social-Democrats, "all individuality is to be
      held in opprobrium, because it is feared that they might lead to
      the French order of things, to Jaurèsism and Millerandism,
      as was stated in so many words by Sindermann, who made the
      report on the subject" at the Party Congress of the Saxon
      Social-Democrats.



      And so, insofar as the new catchwords of the new Iskra
      on organisation contain any principles at all, there can be no
      doubt that they are opportunist principles. This conclusion is
      confirmed both by the whole analysis of our Party Congress,
      which divided into a revolutionary and an opportunist wing, and
      by the example of all European Social-Democratic
      parties, where opportunism in organisation finds expression in
      the same tendencies, in the same accusations, and very often in
      the same catchwords. Of course, the national peculiarities of
      the various parties and the different political conditions in
      different countries leave their impress and make German
      opportunism quite dissimilar from French, French opportunism
      from Italian, and Italian opportunism from Russian. But the
      similarity of the fundamental division of all these parties into
      a revolutionary and an opportunist wing, the similarity of the
      line of thought and the tendencies of opportunism in
      organisation stand out clearly in spite of all this difference
      of

      conditions.[12]
[12]
      No one will doubt today that the old division of the Russian
      Social-Democrats into Economists and politicians on questions of
      tactics was similar to the division of the whole international
      Social-Democratic movement into opportunists and
      revolutionaries, although the difference between Comrades
      Martynov and Akimov, on the one hand, and Comrades von Vollmar
      and von Elm or Jaurés and Millerand, on the other, is very
      great. Nor can there be any doubt about the similarity of the
      main divisions on questions of organisation, in spite of the
      enormous difference between the conditions of politically
      unenfranchised and politically free countries. It is extremely
      charactcristic that the highly principled editors of the new
      Iskra, while briefly touching on the controversy
      between Kautsky and Heine (No. 64), timidly evaded
      discussing the trends of principle manifested on
      questions of organisation by opportunism and orthodoxy
      generally.
    —Lenin


      With large numbers of radical
      intellectuals in the

 

      ranks of our Marxists and our
      Social-Democrats, the opportunism which their mentality produces
      has been, and is, bound to exist, in the most varied spheres and
      in the most varied forms. We fought opportunism on the
      fundamental problems of our world conception, on the questions
      of our programme, and the complete divergence of aims inevitably
      led to an irrevocable break between the Social-Democrats and the
      liberals who had corrupted our legal Marxism. We fought
      opportunism on tactical issues, and our divergence with Comrades
      Krichevsky and Akimov on these less important issues was
      naturally only temporary, and was not accompanied by the
      formation of different parties. We must now vanquish the
      opportunism of Martov and Axelrod on questions of organisation,
      which are, of course, less fundamental than questions of
      tactics, let alone of programme, but which have now come to the
      forefront in our Party life.


      When we speak of fighting opportunism, we must never forget a
      characteristic feature of present-day opportunism in every
      sphere, namely, its vagueness, amorphousness, elusiveness. An
      opportunist, by his very nature, will always evade taking a
      clear and decisive stand, he will always seek a middle course,
      he will always wriggle like a snake between two mutually
      exclusive points of view and try to “agree” with both and reduce
      his differences of opinion to petty amendments, doubts, innocent
      and pious suggestions, and so on and so forth. Comrade Eduard
      Bernstein, an opportunist in questions of programme, “agrees”
      with the revolutionary programme of his party, and although he
      would no doubt like to have it “radically revised”, he considers
      this untimely, inexpedient, not so important as the elucidation
      of “general principles” of “criticism” (which mainly consist in
      uncritically borrowing principles and catchwords from bourgeois
      democracy).Comrade von Vollmar, an opportunist in questions of
      tactics, also agrees with the old tactics of revolutionary
      Social-Democracy and also confines himself mostly to
      declamations, petty amendments, and sneers rather than openly
      advocates any definite “ministerial”

      tactics.[21]
      Comrades Martov and Axelrod, opportunists in questions of organisation, have
      also failed so far to produce, though directly challenged to do
      so, any definite statement of principles that could be “fixed by
      statute”; they too

 

      would like, they most certainly would like, a
      “radical revision” of our Rules of Organisation (Iskra,
      No. 58, p. 2, col. 3), but they would prefer to devote
      themselves first to “general problems of organisation” (for a
      really radical revision of our Rules, which, in spite of
      Paragraph 1, are centralist Rules, would inevitably lead, if
      carried out in the spirit of the new Iskra, to
      autonomism; and Comrade Martov, of course, does not like to
      admit even to himself that he tends in principle
      towards autonomism). Their “principles” of organisation
      therefore display all the colours of the rainbow. The
      predominant item consists of innocent passionate declamations
      against autocracy and bureaucracy, against blind obedience and
      cogs and wheels—declamations so innocent that it is still
      very difficult to discern in them what is really concerned with
      principle and what is really concerned with co-optation. But as
      it goes on, the thing gets worse: attempts to analyse and
      precisely define this detestable “bureaucracy” inevitably lead
      to autonomism; attempts to “lend profundity” to their stand and
      vindicate it inevitably lead to justifying backwardness, to
      tail-ism, to Girondist phrase-mongering. At last there emerges
      the principle of anarchism, as the sole really definite
      principle, which for that reason stands out in practice in
      particular relief (practice is always in advance of
      theory). Sneering at
      discipline—autonomism—anarchism—there you have
      the ladder which our opportunism in matters of organisation now
      climbs and now descends, skipping from rung to rung and
      skilfully dodging any definite statement of its

      principles.[13]
[13]
      Those who recall the debate on Paragraph 1 will now clearly
      see that the mistake committed by Comrade Martov and Comrade
      Axelrod over Paragraph 1 had inevitably to lead,
      when developed and deepened, to opportunism in matters of
      organisation. Comrade Martov’s fundamental
      idea—self-enrolment in the Party—was this same
      false “democracy”, the idea of building the Party from the
      bottom upward. My idea, on the other hand, was
      “bureaucratic” in the sense that the Party was to be built
      from the top downward, from the Party Congress to the
      individual Party organisations. The mentality of the
      bourgeois intellectual, anarchistic phrase-mongering, and
      opportunist, tail-ist profundity were all already displayed
      in the debate on Paragraph 1. Comrade Martov says in his
      State of Siege (p. 20) that “new ideas are
      beginning to be worked out” by the new Iskra. That
      is true in the sense that he and Axelrod are really pushing
      ideas in a new direction, beginning with Paragraph 1. The
      only trouble

 

is that this direction is an
      opportunist one. The more they “work” in this direction, and
      the more this work is cleared of squabbling over
      co-optation, the deeper will they sink in the mire. Comrade
      Plekhanov already perceived this clearly at the Party
      Congress, and in his article “What Should Not Be Done”
      warned them once again: I am prepared, he as much as said,
      even to co-opt you, only don’t continue along this road
      which can only lead to opportunism and anarchism. Martov and
      Axelrod would not follow this good advice: What? Not
      continue along this road? Agree with Lenin that the
      co-optation clamour is nothing but squabbling? Never! We’ll
      show him that we are men of principle!—And they
      have. They have clearly shown everyone that if they have any
      new principles at all, they are opportunist principles.
    —Lenin


Exactly the same stages

 

      are displayed by opportunism in matters of
      programme and tactics: sneering at “orthodoxy”, narrowness, and
      immobility—revisionist “criticism” and
      ministerialism—bourgeois democracy.


      There is a close psychological connection between this hatred of
      discipline and that incessant nagging note of injury
      which is to be detected in all the writings of all opportunists
      today in general, and of our minority in particular. They are
      being persecuted, hounded, ejected, besieged, and bullied. There
      is far more psychological and political truth in these
      catchwords than was probably suspected even by the author of the
      pleasant and witty joke about bullies and bullied. For you have
      only to take the minutes of our Party Congress to see that the
      minority are all those who suffer from a sense of injury, all
      those who at one time or another and for one reason or another
      were offended by the revolutionary Social-Democrats. There are
      the Bundists and the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, whom we
      “offended” so badly that they withdrew from the Congress; there
      are the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists, who were mortally offended
      by the slaughter of organisations in general and of their own in
      particular; there is Comrade Makhov, who had to put up with
      offence every time he took the floor (for every time he did, he
      invariably made a fool of himself) and lastly, there are Comrade
      Martov and Comrade Axelrod, who were offended by the “false
      accusation of opportunism” in connection with Paragraph 1 of the
      Rules and by their defeat in the elections. All these mortal
      offences were not the accidental outcome of impermissible
      witticisms, rude behaviour,

 

      frenzied controversy, slamming of
      doors, and shaking of fists, as so many philistines imagine to
      this day, but the inevitable political outcome of the whole
      three years’ ideological work of Iskra. If in the
      course of these three years we were not just wagging our
      tongues, but giving expression to convictions which were to be
      translated into deeds, we could not but fight the
      anti-Iskra-ists and the “Marsh” at the Congress. And
      when, together with Comrade Martov, who had fought in the front
      line with visor up, we had offended such heaps of people, we had
      only to offend Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martov ever such a
      little bit for the cup to overflow. Quantity was transformed
      into quality. The negation was negated. All the offended forgot
      their mutual scores, fell weeping into each other’s arms, and
      raised the banner of “revolt against

      Leninism”.[14]
[14]
      This amazing expression is Comrade Martov’s (State of
  Siege, p. 68) Comrade Martov waited until he was five
      to one before raising the “revolt” against me alone. Comrade
      Martov argues very unskilfully: he wants to destroy his
      opponent by paying him the highest compliments.
    —Lenin



      A revolt is a splendid thing when it is the advanced elements
      who revolt against the reactionary elements. When the
      revolutionary wing revolts against the opportunist wing, it is a
      good thing. When the opportunist wing revolts against the
      revolutionary wing, it is a bad business.


      Comrade Plekhanov is compelled to take part in this bad business
      in the capacity of a prisoner of war, so to speak. He tries to
      “vent his spleen” by fishing out isolated awkward phrases by the
      author of some resolution in favour of the “majority”, and
      exclaiming: “Poor Comrade Lenin! A fine lot his orthodox
      supporters are!” (Iskra, No. 63, Supplement.)


      Well, Comrade Plekhanov, all I can say is that if I am poor, the
      editors of the new Iskra are downright paupers. However
      poor I may be, I have not yet reached such utter destitution as
      to have to shut my eyes to the Party Congress and hunt for
      material for the exercise of my wit in the resolutions of
      committeemen. However poor I may be, I am a thousand times
      better off than those whose supporters do not utter an awkward
      phrase inadvertently, but on every issue—whether of
      organisation, tactics, or programme—adhere

 

      stubbornly and
      persistently to principles which are the very opposite of the
      principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy. However poor I may
      be, I have not yet reached the stage of having to conceal
      from the public the praises lavished on me by such
      supporters. And that is what the editors of the new
      Iskra have to do.


      Reader, do you know what the Voronezh Committee of the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party stands for? If not, read the
      minutes of the Party Congress. You will learn from them that the
      line of that committee is wholly expressed by ComradeAkimov and
      Comrade Brouckère, who at the Congress fought the
      revolutionary wing of the Party all along the line, and who
      scores of times were ranked as opportunists by everybody, from
      Comrade Plekhanov to Comrade Popov. Well, this Voronezh
      Committee, in its January leaflet (No. 12, January 1904), makes
      the following statement:
    


      “A great and important event in the life of our steadily growing
      Party took place last year: the Second Congress of the
      R.S.D.L.P., a congress of the representatives of its
      organisations. Convening a Party congress is a very complicated
      matter, and, under the prevailing monarchical regime, a very
      dangerous and difficult one. It is therefore not surprising that
      it was carried out in a far from perfect way, and that
      the Congress itself, although it passed off without mishap, did
      not live up to all the Party’s expectations. The comrades whom
      the Conference of 1902 commissioned to convene the Congress were
      arrested, and the Congress was arranged by persons who
      represented only one of the trends in Russian Social-Democracy,
      viz., the ’Iskra’-ists. Many
      organisations of Social-Democrats who did not happen to be
      Iskra-ists were not invited to take part in the work of
      the Congress; partly for this reason the task of
      drawing up a programme and Rules for the Party was
      carried out by the Congress in an extremely imperfect
      manner; the delegates themselves admit that there are
      important flaws in the Rules ’which may lead to dangerous
      misunderstandings’. The Iskra-ists themselves split at
      the Congress, and many prominent members of our R.S.D.L.P. who
      formerly appeared to be in full agreement with the
      Iskra programme of action have come to see that many of
      its views, advocated mainly by Lenin and Plekhanov, are
      impracticable. Although these last gained the upper hand at the
      Congress, the pulse of real life and the requirements of the
      practical work, in which all the non-Iskra-ists are
      taking part, are quickly correcting the mistakes of the
      theoreticians and have, since the Congress, already introduced
      important modifications. ’Iskra’ has changed greatly and
      prorrises to pay careful heed to the demands of all workers
      in the Social-Democratic movement generally. Thus, although
      the results of the Congress will have to be revised at
      the next Congress, and, as is obvious to the

 

      delegates
      themselves, are unsatisfactory and therefore cannot be
      accepted by the Party as unimpeachable decisions, the
      Congress clarified the situation in the Party, provided much
      material for the further theoretical and organising activity of
      the Party, and was an experience of immense instructive value
      for the work of the Party as a whole The decisions of the
      Congress and the Rules it drew up will be taken into
      account by all the organisations, but many will refrain
      from being guided by them exclusively, in view of
      their manifest imperfections.
    

      “Fully realising the importance of the work of the Party as a
      whole, the Voronezh Committee actively responded in all
      matters concerning the organisation of the Congress. It fully
      appreciates the importance of what took place at the Congress
      and welcomes the change under gone by ’Iskra’, which
      has become the Central Organ (chief organ).



      Although the state of affairs in the Party and the Central
      Committee does not satisfy us as yet, we are confident
      that by joint efforts the difficult work of organising the Party
      will be perfected. In view of false rumours, the Voronezh
      Committee informs the comrades that there is no question of the
      Voronezh Committee leaving the Party. The Voronezh Committee
      perfectly realises what a dangerous precedent would be created
      by the withdrawal of a workers’ organisation like the Voronezh
      Committee from the R.S.D.L.P., what a reproach this would be
      to the Party, and how disadvantageous it would be to
      workers’ organisations which might follow this example. We must
      not cause new splits, but persistently strive to unite all
      class-conscious workers and socialists in one party. Besides,
      the Second Congress was not a constituent congress, but only a
      regular one. Expulsion from the Party can only be by decision of
      a Party court, and no organisation, not even the Central
      Committee, has the right to expel any Social-Democratic
      organisation from the Party. Furthermore, under Paragraph 8 of
      the Rules adopted by the Second Congress every organisation is
      autonomous in its local affairs, and the Voronezh Committee
      is accordingly fully entitled to put its views on organisation
      into practice and to advocate them in the Party.”
    

      The editors of the new Iskra, in quoting this leaflet
      in No. 61, reprinted the second half of this tirade, which we
      give here in large type; as for the first half, here printed in
      small type, the editors preferred to omit it.
    

      They were ashamed.

      The reference is to the views of P. B. Struve, leading representative of
      “legal Marxism”, and his book Critical Remarks on the
      Subject of Russia’s Economic Development (1894). Already in this early
      work Struve’s bourgeois-apologetic thinking was clearly discernible. The
      views of Struve and the other “legal Marxists” were assailed

 

      by Lenin in a paper read to a St. Petersburg Marxist circle in the autumn of
      1894, entitled “The Reflection of Marxism in Bourgeois
      Literature”. This paper Lenin then worked up, at the close of 1894
      antI the beginning of 1895, into his essay “The Economic Content of
      Narodism and the Criticism of It in Mr. Struve’s Book” (present

Lenin: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: R. A Few Words On Dialectics. Two Revolutions








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back
(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



R. A Few Words On Dialectics. Two Revolutions

      A general glance at the development of our Party crisis will
      readily show that in the main, with minor exceptions, the
      composition of the two contending sides remained unchanged
      throughout. It was a struggle between the revolutionary wing and
      the opportunist wing in our Party. But this struggle passed
      through the most varied stages, and anyone who wants to find his
      bearings in the vast amount of literature already accumulated,
      the mass of fragmentary evidence, passages torn from their
      context, isolated accusations, and so on and so forth, must
      thoroughly familiarise himself with the peculiarities of each of
      these stages.


      Let us enumerate the principal and clearly distinct stages:
1)
      The controversy over Paragraph 1 of the Rules. A purely
      ideological struggle over the basic principles of
      organisation. Plekhanov and I are in the minority. Martov and
      Axelrod propose an opportunist formulation and find themselves
      in the arms of the opportunists.
2) The split in the
      Iskra organisation over the lists of candidates for the
      Central Committee: Fomin or Vasilyev in a committee of five,
      Trotsky or Travinsky in a committee of three. Plekhanov and I
      gain the majority (nine to seven), partly because of the very
      fact that we were in the minority on Paragraph 1. Martov’s
      coalition with the opportunists confirmed my worst fears over
      the Organising Committee incident.
3) Continuation of the
      controversy over details of the Rules. Martov is again saved by
      the opportunists. We are again in the minority and fight for the
      rights of the minority on the central bodies.
4) The seven
      extreme opportunists withdraw from the Congress. We become the
      majority and defeat the coalition (the Iskra-ist
      minority, the “Marsh”, and the anti-Iskra-ists) in the
      elections. Martov and Popov decline to accept seats in our
      trios.
5) The post-Congress squabble over co-optation. An orgy
      of anarchistic behaviour and anarchistic phrase-mongering. The
      least stable and steadfast elements among the “minority” gain
      the upper hand.
6) To avert a split, Plekhanov adopts the policy
      of “killing with kindness”. The “minority” occupy the editorial
      board of the Central Organ and the Council and attack the
      Central Committee

 

      with all their might. The squabble continues to pervade
      everything.
7) First attack on the Central Committee
      repulsed. The squabble seems to be subsiding somewhat. It
      becomes possible to discuss in comparative calm two purely
      ideological questions which profoundly agitate the Party:
a)
      what is the political significance and explanation of the
      division of our Party into “majority” and “minority” which took
      shape at the Second Congress and superseded all earlier
      divisions?
b) what is the significance in principle of the new
      Iskra’s new position on the question of organisation?


      In each of these stages the circumstances of the struggle and
      the immediate object of the attack are materially different;
      each stage is, as it were, a separate battle in one general
      military campaign. Our struggle cannot be understood at all
      unless the concrete circumstances of each battle are
      studied. But once that is done, we see clearly that development
      does indeed proceed dialectically, by way of contradictions: the
      minority becomes the majority, and the majority becomes the
      minority; each side passes from the defensive to the offensive,
      and from the offensive to the defensive; the starting-point of
      ideological struggle (Paragraph 1) is “negated” and gives place
      to an all-pervading

      squabble[1]
[1]
      The difficult problem of drawing a line
between squabbling and differences of principle now solves
itself: all that relates to co-optation is squabbling; all
that relates to analysis of the struggle at the Congress, to
the controversy over Paragraph 1 and the swing towards
opportunism and anarchism is a difference of principle.
    —Lenin


;

      but then begins “the negation of the
      negation”, and, having just about managed to “rub along” with
      our god-given wife on different central bodies, we return to the
      starting-point, the purely ideological struggle; but by now this
      “thesis” has been enriched by all the results of the
      “antithesis” and has become a higher synthesis, in which the
      isolated, random error over Paragraph 1 has grown into a
      quasi-system of opportunist views on matters of organisation,
      and in which the connection between this fact and the basic
      division of our Party into a revolutionary and an opportunist
      wing becomes increasingly apparent to all. In a word, not only
      do oats grow according to Hegel, but the Russian
      Social-Democrats war among themselves according to Hegel.



      But the great Hegelian dialectics which Marxism made its own,
      having first turned it right side up, must never be confused
      with the vulgar trick of justifying the zigzags of politicians
      who swing over from the revolutionary to the opportunist wing of
      the Party, with the vulgar habit of lumping together particular
      statements, and particular developmental factors, belonging to
      different stages of a single process. Genuine dialectics does
      not justify the errors of individuals, but studies the
      inevitable turns, proving that they were inevitable by a
      detailed study of the process of development in all its
      concreteness. One of the basic principles of dialectics is that
      there is no such thing as abstract truth, truth is always
      concrete.... And, one thing more, the great Hegelian
      dialectics should never be confused with that vulgar worldly
      wisdom so well expressed by the Italian saying: mettere la
      coda dove non va il capo (sticking in the tail where the
      head will not go through).


      The outcome of the dialectical development of our Party struggle
      has been two revolutions. The Party Congress was a real
      revolution, as Comrade Martov justly remarked in his Once
      More in the Minority. The wits of the minority are also
      right when they say: “The world moves through revolutions; well,
      we have made a revolution!” They did indeed make a revolution
      after the Congress; and it is true, too, that generally speaking
      the world does move through revolutions. But the concrete
      significance of each concrete revolution is not defined by this
      general aphorism; there are revolutions which are more like
      reaction, to paraphrase the unforgettable expression of the
      unforgettable Comrade Makhov. We must know whether it was the
      revolutionary or the opportunist wing of the Party that was the
      actual force that made the revolution, must know whether it was
      revolutionary or opportunist principles that inspired the
      fighters, before we can determine whether a particular concrete
      revolution moved the “world” (our Party) forward or backward.


      Our Party Congress was unique and unprecedented in the entire
      history of the Russian revolutionary movement. For the first
      time a secret revolutionary party succeeded in emerging from the
      darkness of underground life into broad daylight, showing
      everyone the whole course and outcome of our internal Party
      struggle, the whole character of

 

      our Party and of each of its more or less noticeable components
      in matters of programme, tactics, and organisation. For the
      first time we succeeded in throwing off the traditions of circle
      looseness and revolutionary philistinism, in bringing together
      dozens of very different groups, many of which had been fiercely
      warring among themselves and had been linked solely by the force
      of an idea, and which were now prepared (in principle, that is)
      to sacrifice all their group aloofness and group independence
      for the sake of the great whole which we were for the first time
      actually creating—the Party. But in politics
      sacrifices are not obtained gratis, they have to be won in
      battle. The battle over the slaughter of organisations
      necessarily proved terribly fierce. The fresh breeze of free and
      open struggle blew into a gale. The gale swept away—and a
      very good thing that it did!—each and every remnant of all
      circle interests, sentiments, and traditions without exception,
      and for the first time created genuinely Party institutions.


      But it is one thing to call oneself something, and another to be
      it. It is one thing to sacrifice the circle system in principle
      for the sake of the Party, and another to renounce one’s own
      circle. The fresh breeze proved too fresh as yet for people used
      to musty philistinism. “The Party was unable to stand the strain
      of its first congress,” as Comrade Martov rightly put it
      (inadvertently) in his Once More in the Minority. The
      sense of injury over the slaughter of organisations was too
      strong. The furious gale raised all the mud from the bottom of
      our Party stream; and the mud took its revenge. The old
      hidebound circle spirit overpowered the still young party
      spirit. The opportunist wing of the Party, routed though it had
      been, got the better—temporarily, of course—of the
      revolutionary wing, having been reinforced by Akimov’s
      accidental gain.


      The result is the new Iskra, which is compelled to
      develop and deepen the error its editors committed at the Party
      Congress. The old Iskra taught the truths of
      revolutionary struggle. The new Iskra teaches the
      worldly wisdom of yielding and getting on with everyone. The old
      Iskra was the organ of militant orthodoxy. The new
      Iskra treats us to a recrudescence of
      opportunism—chiefly on questions of organisation. The old
      Iskra earned the honour of being detested by

 

      the
      opportunists, both Russian and West-European. The new
      Iskra has “grown wise” and will soon cease to be
      ashamed of the praises lavished on it by the extreme
      opportunists. The old Iskra marched unswervingly
      towards its goal, and there was no discrepancy between its word
      and its deed. The inherent falsity of the new Iskra’s
      position inevitably leads—independently even of anyone’s
      will or intention—to political hypocrisy. It inveighs
      against the circle spirit in order to conceal the victory of the
      circle spirit over the party spirit. It hypocritically condemns
      splits, as if one can imagine any way of avoiding splits in any
      at all organised party except by the subordination of the
      minority to the majority. It says that heed must be paid to
      revolutionary public opinion, yet, while concealing the praises
      of the Akimovs, indulges in petty scandal-mongering about the
      committees of the revolutionary wing of the

      Party.[2]
[2]
A stereotyped form has even been worked out for
      this charming pastime: our special correspondent X informs us that Committee
      Y of the majority has behaved badly to Comrade Z of the
      minority. —Lenin


      How shameful! How they have disgraced our old Iskra!


      One step forward, two steps back.... It happens in the lives
      of individuals, and it happens in the history of nations and in
      the development of parties. It would be the most criminal
      cowardice to doubt even for a moment the inevitable and complete
      triumph of the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy, of
      proletarian organisation and Party discipline. We have already
      won a great deal, and we must go on fighting, undismayed by
      reverses, fighting steadfastly, scorning the philistine methods
      of circle wrangling, doing our very utmost to preserve the
      hard-won single Party tie linking all Russian Social-Democrats,
      and striving by dint of persistent and systematic work to give
      all Party members, and the workers in particular, a full and
      conscious understanding of the duties of Party members, of the
      struggle at the Second Party Congress, of all the causes and all
      the stages of our divergence, and of the utter disastrousness of
      opportunism, which, in the sphere of organisation as in the
      sphere of our programme and our tactics, helplessly surrenders
      to the bourgeois psychology, uncritically adopts the point of
      view of bourgeois

 

      democracy, and blunts the weapon of the class
      struggle of the proletariat.
    

      In its struggle for power the proletariat has no other weapon
      but organisation. Disunited by the rule of anarchic competition
      in the bourgeois world, ground down by forced labour for
      capital, constantly thrust back to the “lower depths” of utter
      destitution, savagery, and degeneration, the proletariat can,
      and inevitably will, become an invincible force only through its
      ideological unification on the principles of Marxism being
      reinforced by the material unity of organisation, which welds
      millions of toilers into an army of the working class. Neither
      the senile rule of the Russian autocracy nor the senescent rule
      of international capital will be able to withstand this army. It
      will more and more firmly close its ranks, in spite of all
      zigzags and backward steps, in spite of the opportunist
      phrase-mongering of the Girondists of present-day
      Social-Democracy, in spite of the self-satisfied exaltation of
      the retrograde circle spirit, and in spite of the tinsel and
      fuss of intellectualist anarchism.

(THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY)



Appendix
The Incident of Comrade Gusev and Comrade Deutsch

      This incident is closely bound up with the so-called "false"
      (Comrade Martov’s expression) list mentioned in the letter of
      Comrades Martov and Starover, which has been quoted in Section
      J. The substance of it is as follows. Comrade Gusev informed
      Comrade Pavlovich that this list, consisting of Comrades Stein,
      Egorov, Popov, Trotsky, and Fomin, had been communicated to him,
      Gusev, by Comrade Deutsch (Comrade Pavlovich’s Letter,
      p. 12). Comrade Deutsch accused Comrade Gusev of "deliberate
      calumny" on account of this statement, and a comrades’
      arbitration court declared Comrade Gusev’s "statement"
      "incorrect " (see the court’s decision in
      Iskra, No. 62). After the editorial board of
      Iskra had published the court decision, Comrade
      Martov (not the editorial board this time) issued a special
      leaflet entitled The Decision of the Comrades’ Arbitration
      Court, in which he reprinted in full, not only the decision
      of the court, but the whole report of the proceedings, together
      with a postscript of his own. In this postscript,
      Comrade Martov among other things spoke of "the disgraceful fact
      of the forgery of a list in the interests of a factional
      struggle". Comrades Lyadov and Gorin, who had been delegates to
      the Second Gongress, replied to this leaflet with one of their
      own entitled An Onlooker at the Arbitration Court, in
      which they "vigorously protest against Comrade Martov permitting
      himself to go further than the court decision and to ascribe
      evil motives to Comrade Gusev", whereas the court did not find
      that there had been a deliberate calumny, but only that Comrade
      Gusev’s statement was incorrect. Comrades Gorin and Lyadov
      explained at length that Comrade Gusev’s statement might have
      been due to a quite natural mistake, and

 

      described as
      "unworthy " the conduct of Comrade Martov, who had
      himself made (and again made in his leaflet) a number of
      erroneous statements, arbitrarily attributing evil intent to
      Comrade Gusev. There could be no evil intent there at all, they
      said. That, if I am not mistaken, is all the "literature" on
      this question, which I consider it my duty to help clear up.


      First of all, it is essential that the reader have a clear idea
      of the time and conditions in which this list (of candidates for
      the Central Committee) appeared. As I have already stated in
      this pamphlet, the Iskra organisation conferred during
      the Congress about a list of candidates for the Central
      Committee which it could jointly submit to the Congress. The
      conference ended in disagreement: the majority of the
      Iskra organisation adopted a list consisting of
      Travinsky, Glebov, Vasilyev, Popov, and Trotsky, but the
      minority refused to yield and insisted on a list consisting of
      Travinsky, Glebov, Fomin, Popov, and Trotsky. The two sections
      of the Iskra organisation did not meet together again
      after the meeting at which these lists were put forward and
      voted on. Both sections entered the arena of free agitation at
      the Congress, wishing to have the issue between them settled by
      a vote of the Party Congress as a whole and each trying to win
      as many delegates as it could to its side. This free agitation
      at the Congress at once revealed the political fact I have
      analysed in such detail in this pamphlet, namely, that in order
      to gain the victory over us, it was essential for the
      Iskra-ist minority (headed by Martov) to have the
      support of the "Centre" (the Marsh) and of the
      anti-Iskra-ists. This was essential because the vast
      majority of the delegates who consistently upheld the programme,
      tactics, and organisational plans of Iskra against the
      onslaught of the anti-Iskra-ists and the "Centre" very
      quickly and very staunchly took their stand on our side. Of the
      thirty-three delegates (or rather votes) not belonging to the
      anti-Iskra-ists or the "Centre", we very quickly won
      twenty-four and concluded a "direct agreement" with them,
      forming a "compact majority". Comrade Martov, on the other hand,
      was left with only nine votes; to gain the victory, he needed
      all the votes of the anti-Iskra-ists and the
      "Centre"—with which groups he might join forces (as over
      Paragraph 1 of the Rules), might form

 

      a "coalition", that is,
      might have their support, but with which he could not conclude a
      direct agreement—could not do so because throughout the
      Congress he had fought these groups no less sharply than we
      had. Therein lay the tragicomedy of Comrade Martov’s position!
      In his State of Siege Comrade Martov tries to
      annihilate me with the deadly venomous question: "We would
      respectfully request Comrade Lenin to answer
      explicitly—to whom at the Congress were the
      Yuzhny Rabochy group an outside element?" (p. 23,
      footnote.) I answer respectfully and explicitly: they were an
      outside element to Comrade Martov. And the proof is that whereas
      I very quickly concluded a direct agreement with the
      Iskra-ists, Comrade Martov did not conclude, and could
      not have concluded, a direct agreement with Yuzhny
      Rabochy, nor with Comrade Makhov, nor with Comrade
      Brouckère.


      Only when we have got a clear idea of this political situation
      can we understand the "crux" of this vexed question of the
      celebrated "false" list. Picture to yourself the actual state of
      affairs: the Iskra organisation has split, and we are
      freely campaigning at the Congress, defending our respective
      lists. During this defence, in the host of private
      conversations, the lists are varied in a hundred different
      combinations: a committee of three is proposed instead of
      five;all sorts of substitutions of one candidate for another are
      suggested. I very well recall, for instance, that the
      candidatures of Comrades Rusov, Osipov, Pavlovich, and

      Dyedov[1]
      were suggested in private conversations among the majority, and
      then, after discussions and arguments, were withdrawn. It may
      very well be that other candidatures too were proposed of which
      I have no knowledge. In the course of these conversations each
      Congress delegate expressed his opinion, suggested changes,
      argued, and so on. It is highly unlikely that this was the case
      only among the majority. There is no doubt, in fact, that the
      same sort of thing went on among the minority, for their
      original five (Popov, Trotsky, Fomin, Glebov, and Travinsky)
      were later replaced, as we have seen from the letter of Comrades
      Martov and Starover, by a trio—Glebov, Trotsky, and
      Popov—Glebov, moreover, not being to their taste, so that
      they were very ready to substitute Fomin (see the leaflet of
      Comrades Lyadov and Gorin). It

 

      should not be forgotten that my
      demarcation of the Congress delegates into the groups defined in
      this pamphlet was made on the basis of an analysis undertaken
      post factum; actually, during the election agitation
      these groups were only just beginning to emerge and the exchange
      of opinions among the delegates proceeded quite freely; no
      "wall" divided us, and each would speak to any delegate he
      wanted to discuss matters with in private. It is not at all
      surprising in these circumstances that among all the various
      combinations and lists there should appear, alongside the list
      of the minority of the Iskra organisation (Popov,
      Trotsky, Fomin, Glebov, and Travinsky), the not very different
      list: Popov, Trotsky, Fomin, Stein, and Egorov. The appearance
      of such a combination of candidates was very natural, because
      our candidates, Glebov and Travinsky, were patently not to the
      liking of the minority of the Iskra organisation (see
      their letter in Section J, where they remove Travinsky from the
      trio and expressly state that Glebov is a compromise). To
      replace Glebov and Travinsky by the Organising Committee members
      Stein and Egorov was perfectly natural, and it would have been
      strange if no one of the delegates belonging to the Party
      minority had thought of it.


      Let us now examine the following two questions: 1) Who was the
      author of the list: Egorov, Stein, Popov, Trotsky, and Fomin?
      and 2) Why was Comrade Martov so profoundly incensed that such a
      list should be attributed to him? To give an exact answer to the
      first question, it would be necessary to question all the
      Congress delegates. That is now impossible. It would be
      necessary, in particular, to ascertain who of the delegates
      belonging to the Party minority (not to be confused with the
      Iskra organisation minority) had heard at the Congress
      of the lists that caused the split in the Iskra
      organisation; what they had thought of the respective lists of
      the majority and minority of the Iskra organisation;
      and whether they had not suggested or heard others suggest or
      express opinions about desirable changes in the list of the
      minority of the Iskra organisation. Unfortunately,
      these questions do not seem to have been raised in the
      arbitration court either, which (to judge by the text of its
      decision) did not even learn over just what lists of five the
      Iskra organisation

 

      split. Comrade Byelov, for example
      (whom I class among the "Centre"), "testified that he had been
      on good comradely terms with Deutsch, who used to give him his
      impressions of the work of the Congress, and that if Deutsch had
      been campaigning on behalf of any list he would have informed
      Byelov of the fact." It is to be regretted that it was not
      brought out whether Comrade Deutsch gave Comrade Byelov at the
      Congress his impressions as to the lists of the Iskra
      organisation, and if he did, what was Comrade Byelov’s reaction
      to the list of five proposed by the Iskra organisation
      minority, and whether he did not suggest or hear others suggest
      any desirable changes in it. Because this was not made clear, we
      get that contradiction in the evidence of Comrade Byelov and
      Comrade Deutsch which has already been noted by Comrades Gorin
      and Lyadov, namely, that Comrade Deutsch, notwithstanding his
      own assertions to the contrary, did "campaign in behalf of
      certain Central Committee candidates" suggested by the
      Iskra organisation. Comrade Byelov further testified
      that "he had heard about the list circulating at the Congress a
      couple of days before the Congress closed, in private
      conversation, when he met Comrades Egorov and Popov and the
      delegates from the Kharkov Committee. Egorov had expressed
      surprise that his name had been included in a list of Central
      Committee candidates, as in his, Egorov’s, opinion his
      candidature could not inspire sympathy among the Congress
      delegates, whether of the majority or of the minority." It is
      extremely significant that the reference here is apparently to
      the minority of the "Iskra" organisation, for
      among the rest of the Party Congress minority the candidature of
      Comrade Egorov, a member of the Organising Committee and a
      prominent speaker of the "Centre", not only could, but in all
      likelihood would have been greeted
      sympathetically. Unfortunately, we learn nothing from Comrade
      Byelov as to the sympathy or antipathy of those among the Party
      minority who did not belong to the Iskra
      organisation. And yet that is just what is important, for
      Comrade Deutsch waxed indignant about this list having been
      attributed to the minority of the Iskra organisation,
      whereas it may have originated with the minority which did not
      belong to that organisation!



      Of course, it is very difficult at this date to recall who first
      suggested this combination of candidates, and from whom each of
      us heard about it. I, for example, do not undertake to recall
      even just who among the majority first proposed the candidatures
      of Rusov, Dyedov, and the others I have mentioned. The only
      thing that sticks in my memory, out of the host of
      conversations, suggestions, and rumours of all sorts of
      combinations of candidates, is those "lists" which were directly
      put to the vote in the Iskra organisation or at the
      private meetings of the majority. These "lists" were mostly
      circulated orally (Letter to the Editors of "Iskra",
      p. 4, line 5 from below, it is the combination of five
      candidates which I orally proposed at the meeting that I call a
      "list"); but it also happened very often that they were jotted
      down in notes, such as in general passed between delegates
      during the sittings of the Congress and were usually destroyed
      after the sittings.


      Since we have no exact information as to the origin of this
      celebrated list, it can only be assumed that the combination of
      candidates which we have in it was either suggested by some
      delegate belonging to the Party minority, without the knowledge
      of the Iskra organisation minority, and thereafter
      began to circulate at the Congress in spoken and written form;
      or else that this combination was suggested at the Congress by
      some member of the Iskra organisation minority who
      subsequently forgot about it. The latter assumption seems to me
      the more likely one, for the following reasons: already at the
      Congress the Iskra organisation minority were
      undoubtedly sympathetic towards the candidature of
      Comrade Stein (see present pamphlet); and as to the candidature
      of Comrade Egorov, this minority did undoubtedly arrive
      at the idea after the Congress (for both at the League Congress
      and in State of Siege regret was expressed that the
      Organising Committee had not been endorsed as the Central
      Committee—and Comrade Egorov was a member of the Organising
      Committee). Is it then not natural to assume that this idea,
      which was evidently in tho air, of converting the members of the
      Organising Committee into members of the Central Committee was
      voiced by some member of the minority in private conversation at
      the Party Congress too?



      But instead of a natural explanation, Comrade Martov and Comrade
      Deutsch are determined to see here something sordid—a plot,
      a piece of dishonesty, the dissemination of
      "deliberately false rumours with the object of
      defaming", a "forgery in the interests of a factional
      struggle ", and so forth. This morbid urge can only be
      explained by the unwholesome conditions of émigré
      life, or by an abnormal nervous condition, and I would not even
      have taken the question up if matters had not gone to the length
      of an unworthy attack upon a comrade’s honour. Just think: what
      grounds could Comrades Deutsch and Martov have had for detecting
      a sordid, evil intent in an incorrect statement, in an incorrect
      rumour? The picture which their morbid imaginations conjured up
      was apparently that the majority "defamed" them, not by pointing
      to the minority’s political mistake (Paragraph 1 and the
      coalition with the opportunists), but by ascribing to the
      minority "deliberately false" and "forged" lists. The minority
      preferred to attribute the matter not to their own mistake, but
      to sordid, dishonest, and disgraceful practices on the part of
      the majority! How irrational it was to seek for evil intent in
      the "incorrect statement", we have already shown above, by
      describing the circumstances. It was clearly realised by the
      comrades’ arbitration court too, which did not find any calumny,
      or any evil intent, or anything disgraceful. Lastly, it is most
      clearly proved by the fact that at the Party Congress itself,
      prior to the elections, the minority of the Iskra
      organisation entered into discussions with the majority
      regarding this false rumour, and Comrade Martov even stated his
      views in a letter which was read at a meeting of all the
      twenty-four delegates of the majority!It never even occurred to
      the majority to conceal from the minority of the Iskra
      organisation that such a list was circulating at the Congress:
      Comrade Lensky told Comrade Deutsch about it (see the court
      decision); Comrade Plekhanov spoke of it to Comrade Zasulich
      ("You can’t talk to her, she seems to take me for

      Trepov,"[2]
      Comrade Plekhanov said to me, and this joke, repeated many times
      after, is one more indication of the abnormal state of
      excitement the minority were in); and I informed Comrade Martov
      that his assurance (that the list was not his, Martov’s) was
      quite enough for me (League Minutes, p. 64). Comrade

 

      Martov
      (together with Comrade Starover, if I remember rightly)
      thereupon sent a note to us on the Bureau which ran roughly as
      follows: "The majority of the Iskra editorial board
      request to be allowed to attend the private meeting of the
      majority in order to refute the defamatory rumours which are
      being circulated about them." Plekhanov and I replied on the
      same slip of paper, saying: "We have not heard any defamatory
      rumours. If a meeting of the editorial board is required, that
      should be arranged separately. Lenin, Plekhanov." At the meeting
      of the majority held that evening, we related this to all the
      twenty-four delegates. To preclude all possible
      misunderstanding, it was decided to elect delegates from all the
      twenty-four of us jointly and send them to talk it over with
      Comrades Martov and Starover. The delegates elected, Comrades
      Sorokin and Sablina, went and explained that nobody was
      specifically attributing the list to Martov or Starover,
      particularly after their statement, and that it was of
      absolutely no importance whether this list originated with the
      minority of the Iskra organisation or with the Congress
      minority not belonging to that organisation. After all, we could
      not start an investigation at the Congress and question all the
      delegates about this list! But Comrades Martov and Starover, not
      content with this, sent us a letter containing a formal denial
      (see Section J). This letter was read out by our
      representatives, Comrades Sorokin and Sablina, at a meeting of
      the twenty-four. It might have seemed that the incident could be
      considered closed—not in the sense that the origin of the
      list had been ascertained (if anybody cared about that), but in
      the sense that the idea had been completely dispelled that there
      was any intention of "injuring the minority", or of "defaming"
      anybody, or of resorting to a "forgery in the interests of a
      factional struggle". Yet at the League Congress (pp. 63-64)
      Comrade Martov again brought forth this sordid story conjured up
      by a morbid imagination, and, what is more, made a number of
      incorrect statements (evidently due to his wrought-up
      condition). He said that the list included a Bundist. That was
      untrue. All the witnesses in the arbitration court, including
      Comrades Stein and Byelov, declared that the list had Comrade
      Egorov in it. Comrade Martov said that the list implied a
      coalition in the sense of a direct agreement. That was untrue,
      as I have

 

      already explained. Comrade Martov said that there were
      no other lists originating with the minority of the
      Iskra organisation (and likely to repel the majority of
      the Congress from this minority), "not even forged ones". That
      was untrue, for the entire majority at the Party Congress knew
      of no less than three lists which originated with Comrade Martov
      and Co., and which did not meet with the approval of the
      majority (see the leaflet by Lyadov and Gorin).


      Why, in general, was Comrade Martov so incensed by this list?
      Because it signified a swing towards the Right wing of the
      Party. At that time Comrade Martov cried out against a "false
      accusation of opportunism" and expressed indignation at the
      "misrepresentation of his political position"; but now everybody
      can see that the question whether this list belonged to Comrade
      Martov and Comrade Deutsch could have had no political
      significance whatever, and that essentially, apart
      from this or any other list, the accusation was not false,
      but true, and the characterisation of his political position
      absolutely correct.


      The upshot of this painful and artificial affair of the
      celebrated false list is as follows:


      1) One cannot but join Comrades Gorin and Lyadov in describing
         as unworthy Comrade Martov’s attempt to asperse Comrade
         Gusev’s honour by crying about a "disgraceful fact of the
         forgery of a list in the interests of a factional struggle".


      2) With the object of creating a healthier atmosphere and of
         sparing Party members the necessity of taking every morbid
         extravagance seriously, it would perhaps be advisable at the
         Third Congress to adopt a rule such as is contained in the
         Rules of Organisation of the German Social-Democratic Labour
         Party. Paragraph 2 of these Rules runs: "No person can belong
         to the Party who is guilty of a gross violation of the
         principles of the Party programme or of dishonourable
         conduct. The question of continued membership in the Party
         shall be decided by a court of arbitration convened by the
         Party Executive. One half of the judges shall be nominated by
         the person demanding the expulsion, the other half by the
         person whose expulsion is demanded; the chairman shall be
         appointed by the Party Executive. An appeal against a
         decision of the court of arbitration may be made to the
         Control

 

      Commission or to the Party Congress." Such a rule might serve as
      a good weapon against all who frivolously level accusations (or
      spread rumours) of dishonourable conduct. If there were such a
      rule, all such accusations would once and for all be classed as
      indecent slanders unless their author had the moral courage to
      come forward before the Party in the role of accuser and seek
      for a verdict from the competent Party institution.

      Dear Friends, 

      Boris has informed me that five Central Committee members (he,
      Loshad, Valentin,

 Mitrofan,[2] and
      Travinsky) have passed a vote of censure on me for having voted
      in the Council in favour of a congress and for agitating on
      behalf of a congress. I request each of the five to confirm this
      fact or to explain it to me, for I cannot conceive how
      a member of a body can be censured for doing what it is his
      right and duty to do. You may not agree with him, you may recall
      him from the Council, but to “censure” him is
      strange indeed; for as long as I sat on the Council I could
      not do otherwise than vote in accordance with my
      convictions. And to agitate for a congress is likewise the right
      of every Party member and every member of the Central Committee,
      so that the powers of a Party body in relation to its members do
      not entitle it (either formally or morally) to restrict
      any of us in the exercise of that right. All I am obliged to do
      is to announce that half or more of the Central Committee are
      opposed to a congress.
     

      As regards the Council, the matter has now been arranged as follows:
      Boris has been appointed (by five votes, he says) in place of Kol. My
      resignation (he says) has not been accept ed. I withdraw my
      resignation and remain on the Council. As far as that is concerned,
      the conflict has been settled, and I only ask for an explanation of
      the “censure”.
     

      But far more important is the following conflict: Boris has informed
      me that he finds it impossible to remain a member of the Central
      Committee unless I
(1) stop agitating for a congress, and
(2) work against a congress. Naturally, I can do neither of these things,
      and I have accordingly told Boris that I shall discuss the matter with
      all my colleagues on the Central Committee and shall then
      let him
    

have my reply, which will say whether I am
      resigning from the Central Committee or not. As regards this
      conflict, which threatens to lead to the resignation of one of
      us (or even of one of the two sections of the Central
      Committee), I consider it of the utmost importance to discuss it
      thoroughly, without heat, and with a proper knowledge of the
      facts. I think Boris is much to blame for having presented his
      “ultimatum” without reading either the Council
      minutes (highly important!) or my

      pamphlet,[1]

      in which I set
      forth the principles on which I take my stand. Is it
      wise to aggravate the conflict without going to the bottom of
      the matter, which is a highly complicated one?? Is it wise to
      aggravate it when basically we agree (at any rate, the
      declaration writ ten in the name of the Central Committee by
      Valentin, which was sent to us but did not reach us and
      which Boris told me about, stresses our common stand on
      principles of organisation, as against the opportunist stand of
      the minority)? Even as regards the congress, we differ only as
      to the date, for Boris has no objection to a congress being
      convened six months or a year later. See what emerges. According
      to the Rules, there should be a congress next summer; I consider
      that at best, assuming that our agitation is an
      unqualified success, it will be impossible to convene
      one in under six months, and most likely it will take even
      longer. It turns out that our “difference” boils
      down to a matter of the date! Does it make sense to part company
      over that? Look at the matter from the purely political angle:
      Boris declares that agitation for a congress is incompatible
      with building up positive work, that the former is injurious to
      the latter. I do not agree that they are incompatible; but even
      assuming that Boris is right, what would be the result if he
      succeeded in getting those who disagree with him about this to
      resign from the Central Committee? The result would
      unquestionably be to intensify the agitation
      enormously, to
      exacerbate relations between the majority and the Central
      Committee, and to aggravate for Boris himself the
      business— which he finds so unpleasant—of working
      against a congress. Is there any sense in aggravating matters in
      this way? Boris says that he is against a congress because it
      would mean

    

      a split. I think he misjudges the position as it is today and as it is
      likely to be tomorrow; but even if he is right, by securing our
      resignation from the Central Committee he would enormously
      increase the likelihood of a split, because he would
      undoubtedly be aggravating the situation. To aggravate the conflict
      within the Central Committee would be unwise from any angle.
     

      Essentially, the only difference of opinion between
      Boris and me is that he considers a split at the Third Congress
      inevitable, while I consider it unlikely. We both believe that
      the majority at the Third Congress will be on our side. Boris
      thinks that the minority will leave the Party: neither we nor
      Martov, he feels, will be able to restrain the extremists. I
      think that he fails to take account of the swiftly moving
      situation, which today is not what it was yesterday, and
      tomorrow will not be what it is today. Boris sees the situation
      as it existed yesterday (when the squabbling pushed principles
      into the background, when there could be hopes of
      smoothing things over, of toning them down, of personal
      concessions being successful). That situation exists no longer,
      as I show at length in my pamphlet, and as is shown by the
      general dissatisfaction with the new Iskra (even on the
      part of such mild people as the writers’ group of the Central
      Committee in Russia). The situation today is different:
      principles are pushing the squabbling into the back
      ground. Today it is no longer co-optation that is the issue, not
      by any means. The issue is whether the new
      “Iskra” is right in principle. And it is the
      dissatisfaction with the new Iskra’s principles, which
      is bound to keep growing, that is producing an ever stronger
      agitation for a congress. That is what Boris does not
      appreciate. Tomorrow the squabbling will recede even further
      into the background. On the one hand, the minority will not be
      in a position, morally and politically, to quit (the moment for
      that which existed after the League Congress is gone).
      On the other hand, as I already declared at
      the Council (I once more beg you all to be sure to read the
      Council minutes before rushing at this difficult problem), we by
      no means refuse to make terms. I say to all and sundry that I
      for one am absolutely prepared
(1) to give all the old
      editors a guarantee that everything they write will be published
      at the Party’s expense, without

    

      alteration or comment;
(2) to suspend until the Fourth Congress
      the Central Committee’s right to appoint and dismiss members of
      the local committees;
(3) to guarantee, in a special resolution,
      the more sensitively-felt rights of the minority, and
      even
(4) conditionally, a s
a
l a s t
r e s o r t, to
      make Iskra neutral, keeping its columns free of mutual
      controversy (with the help of a commission of practical workers
      from both sides, etc.). I think that under such circumstances
      the minority at the Third Congress, being only a small minority,
      will not venture to withdraw from the Congress. I think that at
      the Third Congress we shall, by. formally adopted decisions,
      finally dispel the fantasy of a “state of siege” and
      bring about a position where controversies will take their
      course without interfering with positive work. And
      that, after all, is the crux of the whole crisis, that is what I
      tried to secure at the Council, and four- fifths of the congress
      are bound to support it! I know very well that this is what
      Boris wants too, but there is no achieving it without a
      congress. Boris is mistaken in thinking that we started the
      onslaught (by agitating for a congress) and that put the
      minority’s back up. Quite the contrary:
      it was only after a number of letters and appeals, prior to the
      Council and at the Council itself, that we pronounced for a congress,
      and by the agitation we have only shown our strength a little. Whoever
      does not want to land in the ridiculous (if not worse) position of
      Plekhanov (read his article in No. 65) must frankly and openly take up
      a stand in the struggle. Nothing can now stop the agitation for
      a congress. One must be tolerant—neutral, if you
      will—towards
      it, and then it will not interfere with positive work. To rage against
      this agitation is useless.
     

      I earnestly request a reply from each of the Central
      Committee members. It is essential to come to an understanding
      and clear up the matter, so that we may work together, not
      without some differences, perhaps, but without conflicts and
      without attempts to oust one another.

The three Central Committee members Glebov,

Zverev,[2]
and Lenin, having discussed the differences within the
      Central Committee, have arrived at the following conclusions,
      which shall
      be communicated to all members of the Central
      Committee:
     

      1) The differences arose over the question of summoning a
      congress. After Lenin and Vasilyev had declared in the Party
      Council in favour of a congress, the majority of the Central
      Committee (by five votes to four, Travinsky’s vote having
      been transferred to Comrade Glebov) declared against a
      congress. Lenin and Vasilyev thereupon announced
      their provisional resignation from the Council. This conflict has
      now been

      adjusted[1]

      by having Glebov and Lenin
      serve as the Central Committee’s representatives on the Council.
     

      2) Comrade Glebov has informed Comrade Lenin that he, Glebov, will
      resign from the Central Committee unless Lenin gives up agitating
      (outside the Central Committee) for a congress and works against a
      congress. Lenin, considering such an attitude to the question
      wrong and impermissible in principle, states that he will canvass
      the opinion of each of the Central Committee members and will then
      give his reply, which can only be whether he, Lenin, is resigning
      from the Central Committee or not. (What applies to Lenin likewise
      applies, from Comrade Glebov’s standpoint, to all Central
      Committee members sharing Lenin’s view.)
     

      3) To give an accurate picture of the differences within the Central
      Committee at the present time, it should be

    

      stated that Comrade Valentin and Comrade

 Nikitich,[3]

      in the declaration written by them in
      March and approved by
      Comrade Glebov, stated
(1) that they were emphatically
      opposed to co-optation at the demand of the minority;
(2) that they
      shared the views on organisation set out in the pamphlet What Is
To Be Done? and
(3) that they, or at least two of them, did not
      approve of the opportunist position of certain Party writers. As
      regards a congress, Comrade Glebov is convinced
(1) that the
      difference on this question is causing a duality of policy in the
      Central Committee, and
(2) that a congress may lead to a split. It is
      because he does not wish to assume responsibility for this that he
      declares himself bound to resign from the Central Committee. Lenin, on
      the other hand, considers that the Central Committee, being a body
      accountable to the congress, must be neutral in the matter of the
      congress and allow all its members freedom of agitation. As to a
      split, it is unlikely, for the majority are prepared in principle to
      make terms at the congress, even to the point of neutralising
      Iskra.
     

      4) Pending settlement of this conflict all official steps and
      statements by Comrade Glebov and Comrade Lenin on behalf
      of the Central Committee shall only be undertaken by their common
      consent and over their joint signatures.

  I. Answer the tittle-tattle about Bonapartism. Nonsense.
  Beneath dignity to reply. Freedom of agitation for congress.
  No stand by Central Committee

  qua

     talis,[1]

unlike Central
  Organ.
     

  It’s the committees that must decide, and the Central
  Committee invites them to weigh the pros and cons calmly and
  carefully, hear both sides, study the documents without
  undue haste, with an awareness of Party duty.
     

      II. Call for positive work. Importance of present juncture:
      the war. Appeal of Central Committee delegates in the

      Council.[2]

      Repeat. Ideological struggle must not interfere
  with positive work. Impermissible forms of
  struggle. Differences and divergencies should not be
  exaggerated.
     

  III. Attempt gradually to establish passable
  relations. (Karl Kautsky’s

 appeal.[3])
     

  Central Committee proposes terms for a modus vivendi:
     

      1) The right for all six to publish everything at
      the Party’s expense.
     

  2) Idem for writers’ group with representation at
             congress.
     

  3) Suspension for a prolonged period of the appointment and
             dismissal of members.
     

  4) Guarantee for a prolonged period of certain rights of the minority.
     
 

  5) Guarantee that all Party publications will be
             distributed and delivered at a committee’s wish.
     

  6) Truce for at least six months; the finale—a 16-page
             pamphlet shared half-and-half. The minority to have the
  last word.

    1
Speeches Concerning An Inter-Party Conference, May
    31 (June 13)
I

      Does the Council wish to have the Polish Socialist Party
      proposal read out? (Plekhanov: “Yes, it would be
      desirable.”)  “The Polish Socialist Party has always
      believed in the need for close association between the Polish
      and Russian social ist camps with a view to making the struggle
      against the common enemy—tsarism—more effective. Up
      to the present this was unfortunately not possible, with
      resultant inconveniences for both sides in their practical
      work. We there fore warmly welcome the re-establishment of the
      R.S.D.L.P. as a united whole, with central institutions
      responsible for all its activities, since this allows the first
      step to be taken towards what has long been our purpose. We
      realise that the prolonged absence of regular contacts between
      you and ourselves has given rise to a number of mutual
      misunderstandings and dissonances, which must be settled and
      smoothed out before the final framing of the desired agreement
      can be undertaken. Accordingly, our Central Working Committee
      has decided to propose to you that a conference should be held
      abroad at an early date at which delegates from your Party could
      discuss with three delegates of ours the possibilities and
      conditions for joint struggle by our two parties. The results of
      this conference could serve as the basis for an agreement to be
      concluded between the appropriate bodies of the B.S.D.L.P. and
      the P.S.P. Hoping for an early reply, etc.”
 
 

      In reply to this letter the Central Committee asked the
      P.S.P. for fuller particulars as to the nature of the
      conference, the exact bodies to be represented, and the proposed time
      and place. It also inquired how the P.S.P. would feel about having the
      Polish Social-Democrats take part.
     

      The P.S.P. replied with the following letter:
     

      “Dear Comrades,
     

      “We were somewhat surprised by your letter, for it seems to us
      that the answers to the questions it asks are already contained in our
      original letter. The conference we propose would be of a preliminary
      nature, to explore the possibilities of closer association between
      our parties; it could, for example, work out the draft of a permanent
      agreement.
     

      “Our three delegates to negotiate with you have been appointed by
      the Central Committee, which is between congresses the highest
      authority in our Party. Presumably the delegates you appoint to
      negotiate with us will represent the corresponding authority in your
      Party, or whatever body the powers to conduct such negotiations are
      vested in.
     

      “We would propose meeting at some place abroad. The actual
      spot is a secondary matter, though Vienna would suit us
      best. The delegates have been appointed by our Central Committee
      to negotiate with your Party, and not the Social- Democratic
      Party of Poland and Lithuania, and there can therefore be no
      question of delegates from the latter participating.”
     

      Those are all the documents relating to the P.S.P. overtures to
      our Party. I for my part would say that, with the
      P.S.P. refusing to invite delegates from the Polish
      Social-Democrats to the projected conference, we cannot accept
      its proposal. As to the proposal of the Finns, we could consent
      in principle to a preliminary conference. Accordingly I think
      our resolution could be formulated as follows:
     

      “The R.S.D.L.P. consents in principle to a preliminary conference
      with representatives of various revolutionary and opposition parties,
      with a view to reaching agreement on certain specific issues.”
     

      As regards Comrade Martov’s proposal for a prior conference of
      Social-Democratic groups only, I doubt whether this is advisable,
      because besides the Bund, the Polish Social-Democrats, and the
      Proletariat

 Party,[2]
      there are

    

      other Social-Democratic organisations in the border regions, which it
      would hardly be convenient to invite to the conference, while if not
      invited they might be offended.
     
II

      Comrades Axelrod and Martov say the Letts have two
      groups. (Martov: “Two trends.”) The way it comes
      out now is that we are to hold a conference with the one that
      gravitates towards the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      Osvobozhdeniye and inclines towards terrorism
      (according to Comrade Axelrod), while the other group is very
      weak. We must find out more exactly how matters stand. If they
      are merely two trends, that is no concern of ours and we are
      joining forces with what is the Lettish Party. But if they are
      distinct groups, we may land in a very awkward position by
      choosing the wrong one. We must first find out both their
      strength and their complexion. As for the Caucasus, it should, 1
      think, be brought into the conference. For that we must find out
      if there are Social-Democratic organisations there which could
      make common cause with us.

      Speeches On Co-Optation to the Committees
      and the Right of the Central Committee To Appoint
      New Members to Them,
      June 5 (18)
    
I

      In this resolution, irrespective of its practical conclusion, I
      would suggest altering the beginning. Since we cannot pass any
      decisions on the rights and wrongs of the Moscow dispute for
      lack of sufficient information, the resolution ought not to be
      linked up either with any disputes there have been. I would in
      general propose that where one part of an organisation lodges a
      complaint against the other, the other part should be notified,
      so as to have a chance to put its case too. For example, as
      regards the Moscow dispute things were not as Comrade Martov
      says they were. According to my information, three out of the
      five members wanted to co-opt two new members to the committee,
      and the rest were willing, only provided another member from
      their side was co-opted too, which would still have
      maintained—and even strengthened—the predominant
      trend. It was only the majority’s categorical refusal to agree
      to this combination that made the Moscow comrades want to invoke
      the Rules. And while one Central Committee member was in favour
      of the committee majority’s interpretation of the Rules, another
      Central Committee representative opposed it.
     

      I say this only by way of a statement of fact and to have it recorded
      in the minutes. And so, I move that the beginning of Comrade Martov’s
      resolution be altered so that it

    

      will lay down a definite ruling to operate henceforth, in the
      future. As for the ruling itself, I would suggest that all
      fractions be treated as a full unit.
     
II

      This incident goes to show anew that in cases where one side
      lodges a complaint, the other side should at once be notified,
      so that it may offer its explanations. Only in that case shall
      we be in a position to adopt appropriate decisions on the
      disputes. According to our information, what happened was
      this. The Nikolayev Committee consisted of people belonging to
      the majority. Then all of them were arrested. Thereupon the
      Central Committee, or possibly a representative of it,
      appointed three members to the Nikolayev Committee, among them
      two who had not previously been in Nikolayev and one who had
      already worked there before and possessed numerous contacts. It
      may be that at the moment of the arrests this third one was not
      in Nikolayev either. When the Central Committee’s candidates
      arrived in Nikolayev, they already found there two minority
      members who wanted to work, and agreed to admit them. So the
      fact is that the three co-opted the two. That is how it was. To
      verify it, inquiries can be made of the committee members, if
      they have not been arrested yet.... (Mar toy:
      “They already have....”)
     

      According to our information, the facts are quite different
      from what has been represented, and to my way of thinking the
      two majority members were right in acting as they did. The place
      where the candidates named by the Central Committee happen to
      be cannot serve as a reason for not admitting them. I again
      suggest passing a resolution to the effect that in cases of
      complaints both sides shall be given a hearing. As to the actual
      point at issue, I disagree with Comrade Martov’s resolution in
      principle. The Central Committee cannot be deprived of the
      right to appoint its own candidates to the committees. Of
      course, all authority is open to abuse, but to combat that evil
      there is control—in the form of the press, for example, or
      action by the Council, etc. I join in the view that in the
      co-optation of new members the question of group distinctions
      should not be allowed

    

      to have any place. I do not know so far of a single case of the
      Central Committee forcing anyone upon a committee. All this talk of
      forcible appointment causes it to be very careful, and sheer tact
      restrains it from exercising its right.
     
III

      There are a few comments I want to make. First of all I should
      like to point out that the claim that two of the candidates were
      sent to the Nikolayev Committee from Odessa or even by the
      Odessa Committee is based on some sort of misunderstanding. Most
      likely there was a Central Committee agent in Odessa, who duly
      took steps to re-establish the Nikolayev Committee after the
      arrests. At any rate we know quite definitely that these three
      people were appoint ed to it by the Central Committee, not
      anybody else. I say this in passing, so as to remove any
      possible misunderstandings on this score. Secondly, Comrade
      Martov’s statement that he too does not know of a single case of
      the Central Committee forcing its candidates on local committees
      is very important, particularly as the editorial board, through
      its agents, has full information about what goes on in the
      Party. As to the young woman who Comrade Martov says demanded to
      be co-opted to the Moscow Committee without a ballot, that
      example can hardly carry any weight, for we do not know either
      the circumstances of the case or the extent of her
      authorisation; and anyway, she was in fact admitted to the
      committee only after a ballot. Thirdly, I also think it very
      important to note Comrade Martov’s remark that in normal
      conditions the Central Committee’s power of influencing the
      composition of the local committees cannot be restricted. It
      has been said here that people accuse the Central Committee of
      artificially “manufacturing” the committees; but
      then, accusations of a similar nature are not infrequently to be
      heard against the Central Organ. And since, as acknowledged by
      Comrade Martov himself, there are in reality no such cases, and
      the whole thing comes down to no more than the
      possibility of them, I don’t think that is a sufficient
      reason for restricting the Central Committee’s powers,
      particularly as in practice the mere fact of such an approach
      will
      arouse a certain resentment. I am quite ready to concur

    

      in Comrade Martov’s opinion that the two members of the Nikolayev
      Committee whom he speaks of are very valuable revolutionary
      workers—but then, they were, in point of fact, admitted
      to the committee.
     

      In general, one may say that, precisely because of the various
      imputations that have been current recently, the Central Committee has
      acted with the greatest circumspection and has been in no haste to
      avail itself of its right to appoint new members to the local
      organisations. And I have nothing against these cautious tactics being
      formally laid down for a time, by way of precluding and putting an end
      to false rumours about the Central Committee.
     

      As regards our point about notifying the other side in cases of a
      complaint being lodged, I move the following resolution: “The
      Party Council requests Party organisations, in all cases of a
      complaint or inquiry being addressed to it by any part of an
      organisation, immediately and fully to notify the other part of the
      organisation of the contents of that complaint or inquiry, for in
      order to settle disputes the Party Council must have a statement of
      both sides of the case. The same applies to complaints by one
      organisation against

 another.”[3]

Speech On the Newspaper

 Rassvet,[4] June 5 (18)
    

      Unfortunately, there is not very much I can say in defence of
      Rassvet. So far this experiment does have to be
      acknowledged not altogether successful. Bonch-Bruyevich is not
      an experienced journalist and was entitled to expect help from
      other Party writers. This help was not forthcoming, and under
      the circumstances it is not fair to put all the blame for the
      failure on him alone. It is only five months so far since the
      beginning of publication. The paper may still get on its feet,
      particularly if other writers come to its aid. Something has,
      after all, been accomplished: contacts among the sects are
      broadening, both in America and in Russia. It should also be
      mentioned that financially this publication does not tax the
      Party’s resources, since it is financed out of other funds. I
      think closing it down would be premature and move that the
      experiment be continued.
     

 
Notes
 
 



[1]

      The Party Council session of May 31 and June 5 (June 13 and 18),
      1904, was held in Geneva, with Lenin, Plekhanov, Noskov, Axel rod, and
      Martov attending. The first sitting discussed the convening of an
      inter-party conference of all revolutionary and opposition parties in
      Russia, and the forthcoming Amsterdam International Congress. The second
      dealt with internal Party affairs: 1) the right of the central Party
      institutions (the Central Organ and Central Committee) to recall their
      representatives from the Council; 2) the number of votes required under the
      Rules for effecting cooptation to the local committees; 3) co-optation to
      the committees and the right of the Central Committee to appoint new members
      to them; 4) the voting qualifications of Party organisations on the question
      of convening the Third Party Congress; and certain other items.

     

      On the more important questions of internal Party life, Menshevik decisions
      were passed.
     



[2]

      The Proletariat Party was a socialist party formed in Poland in
      1900 of groups that had broken away from the Polish Socialist Party
      (P.S.P.). While in general accepting the Social-Democratic programme, it
      believed in individual terrorism and the federal principle of
      organisation. The party stood for closer contact be tween the Polish and
      Russian revolutionary movement; its immedi ate aim was a democratic
      constitution for Russia with autonomy for Poland. The Proletariat Party did
      not play any noticeable part in the Polish revolutionary movement, and went
      out of existence after the Revolution of 1905-07.
     



[3]

      This resolution was unanimously adopted by the Council.
     



[4]

Rassvet
      (Dawn) was a Social-Democratic paper for members of the religious
      sects, started under a decision of the Second Party Con gress. The first
      issue appeared in January 1904. Although the Party Council session in June
      1904 ruled that publication be discontin ued, the paper went on appearing
      until September of that year. Nine issues were published in all.

      A private meeting was recently held of nineteen members of the
      R.S.D.L.P. (among them Second Congress delegates, members of
      committees and other Party organisations, and revolutionaries not
      belonging to any Party organisation). This conference of persons who
      are at one in sharing the views of the Second Party Congress majority
      discussed our Party crisis and ways and means of overcoming it, and
      decided to address the following appeal to all Russian
      Social-Democrats.
     

      Comrades, the grave crisis in our Party is dragging on
      interminably. The strife keeps growing, breeding dispute after
      dispute, disastrously hampering positive work all along the
      line, and increasingly destroying the bond between the Party
      and its Central Organ, which has definitely become the organ of
      a circle and mainly an 6migr6 circle at that. That organ is
      manufacturing differences, ferreting out old questions that have
      long been settled and are a thing of the past; it coquettes with
      the consistent opportunists and betrays incredible confusion in
      its thinking; it shamelessly ignores the Party Congress, its
      debates and decisions, and mocks at Party organisation and
      discipline and at the majority of the revolutionaries who
      created the
      Party and are doing the work on the spot; basing itself on
      unprovable allegations and unauthenticated anonymous reports, it
      carpingly and maliciously crows over shortcomings in the work of
      the committees of the Party’s revolutionary wing. That is what
      we are getting from the new Iskra, which has become a
      fountainhead of strife; that is what we are getting from the
      editorial board which the Congress rejected,

    

      and which has taken advantage of personal concessions to start new
      squabbles over co-optation and disrupt the Party.
     

      Yet the historical juncture Russia is now passing through calls
      for the exertion of all our Party’s energies. The revolutionary
      unrest among the working class and the ferment among other
      sections of the population is growing apace; the war and crisis,
      starvation and unemployment are under mining the foundations of
      the autocracy ever more deeply; a shameful end to the shameful
      war is not far off, and it is bound to heighten the
      revolutionary unrest still more, it will bring the working class
      face to face with its enemies, and will require the most
      vigorous offensive action on the part of the Social-Democrats. A
      united Party organisation, a consistent revolutionary Marxist
      line, decent and dignified bounds to the internal struggle in
      the Party so as to prevent its becoming disruptive and hampering
      positive work—these are urgent demands of the entire
      working-class movement of Russia, and they must be satisfied
      immediately and at all costs, or the Russian Social-Democratic
      Labour Party will risk completely forfeiting its good name and
      all the influence it has won.
     

      The first step towards this end, in our opinion, is to establish
      the fullest clarity, frankness, and outspokenness in the
      relations between the various groups, trends, and shades in our
      Party. There are times, to be sure, when in the interests of the
      work minor differences should be passed over in silence; but to
      think that the present is such a moment in our Party’s life
      would be a most deplorable and unpardonable mistake. Personal
      concessions to the minority did not check the strife, the
      disputed issues have now been put point-blank, a direct
      challenge has been hurled at the entire Party, and only flabby
      and ignorant individuals can dream of bringing back the
      irrevocable past, of concealing, withholding, glossing over or
      shutting their eyes to anything. No, the policy of washing one’s
      hands, the policy of passive abstention, the policy of
      laisser faire, laisser passer has already proved its
      utter futility in our Party struggle. Any further evasion,
      equivocation or concealment would be not only fruitless and
      contemptible, but downright criminal. We are taking the
      initiative of making a frank and full

    

      statement of our programme of struggle within the Party; and we
      call on the representatives of each and every shade in the
      Russian Social-Democratic movement, whether already belonging to
      the Party or intending to join it under certain conditions, to
      do likewise. Only complete clarity and frankness can furnish
      all class-conscious workers and all members of the Party with
      the material for a rational and firm decision of the disputed
      Party issues.
     

      We uphold the standpoint of the Second Party Congress
      majority. We consider that the erroneous position of the
      Congress minority, and their determination to persist in this
      position regardless of the will of the Party, was the prime
      cause of all subsequent mistakes and of all the strife. The
      error in that position was twofold: firstly, the old editorial
      circle of Iskra could look for support to no one but
      the opportunist wing of our Congress and our Party; secondly,
      this alliance with acknowledged opportunists (who were, and are,
      headed by Comrade Akimov) took final shape and became a Party
      division only over such an issue as the elections to the central
      bodies. From the first error there logically and inevitably
      followed all that confusion as to principle and all that
      opportunist wobbling which we find in the thinking of the new
      Iskra, insofar as that thinking can be considered to be
      based on principle at all. From the second error followed their
      insistence on the old editorial circle against the will of the
      Party, their defence and justification of the circle spirit as
      against the party spirit, their employment in our controversies
      of methods only associated with philistine squabbling and
      circle wrangling, but certainly not with a struggle among Party
      members who respect their Party and them selves. From the first
      error it followed as a logical and inevitable consequence that
      those who rallied around the minority included all who tend
      towards opportunism, all who want to drag the Party back and be
      revenged for injuries done by the revolutionary Social-Democrats
      to their opponents, all who express the intellectualist trend in
      our movement, all who incline towards the intellectual’s
      anarchistic rejection of organisation and discipline. From the
      second error followed the supremacy of an 6migr6 circle over
      the majority of the Party workers in Russia and the orgy of
      specifically

    

      6migr6 brawling which among the minority takes the place of methods of
      persuasion.
     

      There is no longer any room for doubt. No one who is a Party
      member not only in name, no one who really wants to uphold the
      vital interests of our working-class movement, can hesitate
      now. The minority have declared war and are fighting all along
      the line; and we accept the challenge and declare that the war
      will be relentless, a war to a finish. We are fighting against
      the circle spirit in general, and the old editorial circle in
      particular, on behalf of the party spirit. We are fighting in
      the interests of the working-class movement in Russia against
      6migr6 squabbling. We are fighting on behalf of the
      revolutionary proletarian trend in our movement against the
      opportunist intellectualist trend. We are fighting for the
      consistent revolutionary Social- Democratic line against
      vacillation, zigzags, and reversions to the long-obsolete
      past. We are fighting for a close-knit Party organisation of our
      working-class vanguard and against intellectualist license,
      disorganisation, and anarchy. We are fighting for respect for
      Party congresses and against spine less veering about, against
      divergence of word and deed, against contempt for agreements and
      decisions adopted by common consent. We are fighting for
      publicity in the Party as against the new Iskra’s and
      the new Party Council’s tactics of keeping their minutes a
      secret and gagging the majority.
     

      From our programme of struggle the methods and immediate aims
      of that struggle follow of themselves. The first method is
      all-embracing agitation, spoken and written, on the widest
      possible scale. This point would not be worth dwelling on were
      it not that the minority’s squabbling has given rise in our
      Party to the notorious “conciliatory trend” (so
      justly ridiculed by the Ekaterinoslav Committee and many other
      organisations), which hides its head under its wing and preaches
      that the majority should cease its struggle against the
      minority. The existence of such childish views, unworthy of any
      adult Party member, cam only be attributed to faint-heartedness,
      weariness, or remoteness from reality. One may and should
      demand that the party struggle be confined within party bounds,
      one may and should use other means besides exhortation to secure
      it;

    

      but the proposal to cease upholding what was upheld before the entire
      Party at the Congress and what is deemed essential in the Party’s
      vital interests—such a proposal, if anyone dared to make it
      publicly, would only earn universal contempt.
     

      The second, and decisive, means of struggle, in our opinion, is
      a Party congress. We unreservedly support those committees which
      demand that the Third Party Congress be summoned immediately. We
      consider it our duty, in particular, to deal with the
      hypocritical arguments which the editors of the new
      Iskra and their overt and covert abettors bring against
      a congress, while assiduously concealing these arguments (which
      are scarcely consistent with Party duty) from the eyes of the
      world (as is being done by the League Abroad and the
      Iskra editors, whose agitation has only partly been
      brought into the open and exposed by the commit- tees). First
      argument: a congress would lead to a split. The very fact that
      the minority employ such an argument demonstrates the entire
      falsity of their position. For in saying that, the minority
      admit that the Party is against them, that their 6migr6 circle
      has forced itself upon the Party and manages to maintain itself
      only because of the remoteness of Russia and the external
      difficulties under which the real revolutionaries have to
      work. Those who are honest towards the Party and sincerely
      anxious to work together will not fear a congress, but desire
      it, in order to put an end to the strife, bring the Party and
      its official bodies into conformity, and remove unseemly
      ambiguity. Those who hold up the bogey of a split only make it
      obvious that their consciences are not clear. Without the
      subordination of minority to majority there can be no
      working-class party at all worthy of the name; and if mutual
      (not one-sided) concessions are necessary, if arrangements and
      agreements between different parts of the Party have sometimes
      to be made, they are only possible and permissible at a
      congress. No self-respecting revolutionary will want to remain
      in a party that manages to hold together only because a party
      congress is artificially put off.
     

      Second argument: a reconciliation is still possible without a
      congress. What this opinion is based on is unknown. Its proponents
      talk and act only behind the scenes. Is it not

    

      time to abandon these back-stage intrigues, which only in crease
      mutual distrust, intensify animosity, and obscure the situation?
      Why is it that no one ventures to come forward publicly with a
      plan of reconciliation?—is it not because, the position
      being what it is, no such plan is conceivable which would not at
      best provoke laughter? Those who under stand peace to mean the
      co-optation of minority favourites to the Central Committee do
      not want peace, but intensification of the majority’s struggle;
      they fail to understand that the struggle in the Party has once
      and for all outgrown the limits of a mere squabble over
      co-optation. Those who understand it to mean the cessation of
      controversy and struggle are reverting to the old circle
      mentality: there will always be controversy and struggle in a
      party, all that is necessary is to confine them within Party
      bounds—and that only a congress can do. In short,
      whichever way ou turn this slogan of peace without a congress,
      however you revolve this idea of reconciling the contending
      sides without satisfying either, you will find that this
      brilliant idea only reflects confusion and emptiness of mind, it
      is the idea of people who do not know what they want and what
      they ought to strive for. If even the plan of so influential
      (formerly influential) a man as Plekhanov—to quench the
      fire at the very start by making the maximum personal
      concessions—suffered a complete fiasco, can one seriously
      speak of such plans now?
     

      Third argument: the congress may be manipulated. The
      St. Petersburg Committee has already replied to this argument
      by calling it an

 insinuation.[2]
      And this statement
      by a local committee was a well-deserved slap in the face for
      those who make sneaking charges without a shadow of fact to
      support them, although the minority control both the supreme
      Council and the press organ of the Party, so that they have not
      only the means of publicly exposing any suspected abuses, but
      also the means of administrative correction and
      pressure. Everyone knows that if there were any such facts the
      minority would have trumpeted them forth long ago, and that the
      recent Council resolution, which shows that there have been no
      such facts in the past, rules out their possibility in the

 future.[3]
      By resorting to this argument
      Iskra only shows yet again that instead of controversy
      it now engages in fishwives’ abuse, and compels

    

      us to turn to all Party members and ask: Have we in fact a party? Do
      we want to follow the Socialist-Revolutionaries’ example and rest
      content with a facade and signboard, or is it not rather our duty to
      tear down all shams?
     

      Fourth argument: the differences have not yet been clarified. The
      best answer to that argument is supplied by the new Iskra
      itself, a study of which will show the Party that differences are
      being manufactured, not clarified, and that the confusion is growing
      endlessly. Only a congress, at which all comrades can openly and fully
      state their wishes, can bring clarity into these incredibly confused
      issues and this confused situation
     

      Fifth argument: a congress would divert forces and funds from positive
      work. This argument, too, sounds like a dismal mockery, for no
      greater diversion of forces and funds can be imagined than that which
      the strife is Producing.
     

      No, all the arguments against a congress testify either to hypocrisy
      or to ignorance of the position and pusillanimous doubts of the
      Party’s strength. Our Party is again very sick, but it has strength
      enough to recover and become worthy of the Russian proletariat As the
      methods of cure we would recommend the three following reforms, which
      we shall work for by every available loyal means.
     

      Firstly, the editorship of the Central Organ to be handed over to the
      adherents of the Second Party Congress majority.
     

      Secondly, the local organisation abroad (the League) to be
      subordinated in fact to the all-Russia central organisation (the
      Central Committee).
     

      Thirdly, the Rules to provide guarantees that Party struggles are
      conducted by Party methods.
     

      Regarding these three fundamental points of our programme little
      remains to be added after what has already been said. That the old
      editorial board of Iskra has now palpably demonstrated its
      unfitness, we consider incontrovertible. It is not Iskra-ism
      that has outlived its day, as Comrade Martov professed to discover
      after his defeat in the elections, hut the old Iskra
      editorial board. It would be sheer hypocrisy not to say that bluntly
      now, after the challenges this circle has flung down to the entire
      Party. On the abnormal position of the organisatio  abroad, which has
      converted itself

    

      into a second (if not a third) leadership and completely ignores
      the Party’s Central Committee, there is no need to expatiate at
      length. Lastly, the entire experience of the post- Congress
      struggle compels us to give thought to the juridical position of
      the minority (any minority) in our Party. That experience shows,
      we are convinced, that it is necessary to include in the Party
      Rules guarantees of minority rights, so that the
      dissatisfactions, irritations and conflicts that will constantly
      and unavoidably arise may be diverted from the accustomed
      philistine channels of rows and squabbling into the still
      unaccustomed channels of a constitutional and dignified struggle
      for one’s convictions. As one of these essential guarantees, we
      propose that the minority be allowed one or more writers’
      groups, with the right to be represented at congresses and with
      complete “freedom of speech”. In general, the widest
      guarantees should be given as regards publication of Party
      literature criticising the activities of the central Party
      institutions. The committees should be given the right to
      receive (through the general Party transport system) the
      particular Party publications they desire. The Central
      Committee’s right to influence the personal composition of the
      committees otherwise than by advice should, until the Fourth
      Congress, be suspended. We do not here elaborate our proposals
      in detail, for we are not compiling draft Rules, but only a
      general programme of struggle. We consider it highly important
      that the arrangements for publication of minority literature
      which the Central Committee proposed to the minority of the
      Second Congress should be incorporated in the Rules, in order
      that dissatisfaction may find seemly forms of expression, that
      the foolish fantasy of a state of siege (invented by the heroes
      of co-optation) may he finally and completely dispelled, and
      that the inevitable internal struggles in the Party may not
      interfere with positive work.
     

      We must teach our minority to fight about the personal composition of
      the central bodies only at congresses, and not hamper our work after
      congresses by squabbling; we must achieve this if our Party is
      not to perish. Lastly, in this general programme we shall only briefly
      mention certain specific amendments we would wish to see made in the
      Rules, to wit: the conversion of the Council from a tripartite

    

      arbitration body into a body elected by the Congress; amendment of
      Paragraph I of the Rules along the lines advocated by the Second
      Congress majority, with the inclusion among Party organisations of all
      workers’ organisations and all groups of Russian Social-Democrats
      which had an independent existence during the circle period and which
      desire to join the Party, etc., etc.
     


      In putting forward this programme of our struggle within the Party, we
      invite all Party organisations and the representatives of all shades
      in the Party to make a statement of their own programmes, so as to
      permit of gradual, serious, circumspect, and judicious preparation for
      a congress.
     


      We have no Party—the conspirators in our editorial palace
      coup said to themselves, banking on the remoteness of Russia,
      the frequent changes of workers there, and on their own
      indispensability. Our Party is coming into being!— say we,
      seeing the committees awakening to active intervention, seeing
      the growing political understanding of the advanced workers. Our
      Party is coming into being; we have ever more numerous young
      forces capable both of reinvigorating and of replacing decrepit
      literary bodies; we have revolutionaries, and their number is
      steadily growing, who prize the trend of the old Iskra
      that schooled them above any editorial circle. Our Party is
      coming into being, and no subterfuges or delays, no senile
      malicious vituperation of the new Iskra can hold back
      the decided and final verdict of this Party.
     

      From these new forces in our Party we derive our certainty of victory.

      A private meeting was recently held of twenty-two members of the

 R.S.D.L.P.,[1]
      persons who are at one in sharing the views

      of the Second Party Congress majority. This conference discussed our
      Party crisis and ways and means of overcoming it, and decided to
      address the following appeal to all Social-Democrats of Russia:
     

      Comrades, the grave crisis in our Party life is dragging on and on,
      and no end is in sight. The strife keeps growing, breeding dispute
      after dispute, and the Party’s positive work all along the line is
      hampered by it to the utmost. The energies of the Party, still young
      and not yet consolidated, are being grievously dissipated.
     

      Yet the present historical juncture makes vast demands on the Party,
      vaster than ever before. The revolutionary unrest among the working
      class is growing, and so is the ferment among other sections of
      society; the war and crisis, starvation and unemployment are with
      elemental and inevitable force undermining the foundations of the
      autocracy. A shameful end to the shameful war is not far off; and it
      is bound to heighten the revolutionary unrest still more, it is bound
      to bring the working class face to face with its enemies, and it will
      require of the Social-Democrats tremendous effort, a colossal exertion
      of energy to organise the last decisive fight against the autocracy.
     

      Is our Party equal to these demands in its present condition? Every
      honest man will unhesitatingly answer:
      No!
     

      The unity of the Party has been deeply undermined, its internal
      struggle has gone beyond all party bounds. Organised discipline has
      been shaken to its very foundations, and

    

      the Party’s capacity for harmonious and united action is fading into a
      mere dream.
     

      Nonetheless, we regard the Party’s sickness as a matter of growing
      pains. We consider that the underlying cause of the crisis is the
      transition from, the circle form to party forms of the life of
      Social-Democracy; the essence of its internal struggle is a conflict
      between the circle spirit and the party spirit. And, consequently,
      only by shaking off this sickness can our Party become a real
      party.
     

      Under the name of the Party “minority” there have united a
      variety of elements who are linked by a conscious or unconscious
      desire to preserve circle relationships, pre-party forms of
      organisation.
     

      Certain prominent figures in the more influential of the former
      circles, unaccustomed to the organisational self- limitations
      which Party discipline demands, are inclined from force of habit
      to confuse their own circle interests with the general Party
      interests, with which in the period of the circles they may in
      many cases indeed have coincided. A number of these people (part
      of the former Iskra editorial board, part of the former
      Organising Committee, the members of the former Yuzhny
      Rabochy group, and others) have been the leaders in a
      struggle on behalf of the circle spirit as against the party
      spirit.
     

      Their allies proved to be all those elements who in theory or
      practice had deviated from the principles of strict Social-
      Democracy (the Economists, Rabocheye-Dyelo-ists, etc.),
      for only the circle atmosphere could preserve the ideological
      individuality and the influence of these elements, whereas the
      Party atmosphere threatened to absorb them or deprive them of
      all influence. Lastly, the opposition cadres have in general
      been drawn chiefly from those elements in our Party which
      consist primarily of intellectuals. The intelligentsia is always
      more individualistic than the proletariat, owing to its very
      conditions of life and work, which do not directly involve a
      large-scale combination of efforts, do not directly educate it
      through organised collective labour. The intellectual elements
      therefore find it harder to adapt themselves to the discipline
      of Party life, and those of them who are not equal to it
      naturally raise the standard of revolt against the necessary
      organisational

    

      limitations, and elevate their instinctive anarchism to a principle
      of struggle, misnaming it a desire for “autonomy”, a
      demand for “tolerance”, etc.
     

      The section of the Party abroad, where the circles are
      comparatively long-lived, where theoreticians of various shades
      are gathered, and where the intelligentsia decidedly
      predominates, was bound to be most inclined to the views of the
      “minority”, which there as a result soon proved to
      be the actual majority. Russia, on the other hand, where the
      voice of the organised proletarians is louder, where the Party
      intelligentsia too, being in closer nd more direct contact with
      them, is trained in a more proletarian spirit, and where the
      exigencies of the immediate struggle make the need for organised
      unity more strongly felt, came out in vigorous opposition to the
      circle spirit and the disruptive anarchistic tendencies. It gave
      quite clear expression to this attitude in numerous statements
      by committees and other Party organisations.
     

      The struggle developed and grew increasingly acute. And to what
      lengths has it not gone!
     

      The Party organ, of which the “minority” managed to seize
      control against the will of the Congress and thanks to personal
      concessions by the editors elected at the Congress, has become an
      organ of struggle against the Party!
     

      It is now least of all the ideological leader of the Party in
      its struggle against the autocracy and the bourgeoisie, and most
      of all the leader of circle opposition to the party spirit. On
      the one hand, conscious that its fundamental position is
      indefensible from the standpoint of the Party’s interests, it is
      busy searching out real and imaginary differences to provide an
      ideological screen for that position; and in this search,
      seizing on one slogan one day and on another the next, it is
      turning more and more for its material to the Right wing of the
      Party—the former opponents of Iskra— and
      drawing ever closer to them ideologically, trying to
      rehabilitate their theories, which the Party has rejected, and
      to
      turn the Party’s ideological life back to what had already
      seemed the bygone period of vagueness of principle and
      ideological wavering and vacillation. On the other hand, in an
      endeavour to undermine the moral influence of the Party
      majority, the new Iskra is even busier searching

    

      out and denouncing mistakes on the part of their adherents,
      magnifying every real slip to monstrous proportions and trying
      to lay the blame for it on the Party majority as a whole, and
      seizing on every insinuation and piece of circle gossip that
      could prove damaging to its opponents, often enough not even
      troubling about their verisimilitude, let alone verifying their
      truth. In this course the men of the new Iskra have
      gone so far as to impute to members of the majority absolutely
      non-existent and in fact impossible crimes—and not only of
      a political nature (as when they accuse the Central Committee of
      forcibly ejecting individuals and breaking up organisations),
      but even crimes against common ethics (as when prominent figures
      in the Party are accused of forgery or moral complicity in
      forgery). Never before has the Party been immersed in such a sea
      of mud as the bmigr6 minority have stirred up in the present
      controversy.
     

      How could all this have happened?
     

      The mode of action of each of the sides corresponded to its
      fundamental trend. The Party majority, anxious at all costs to’
      preserve the Party’s unity and organisational cohesion, fought
      only by loyal Party means, and more than once made concessions
      for the sake of reaching a reconciliation. The minority,
      following an anarchistic trend, showed no concern for peace and
      unity in the Party. They turned every concession into a weapon
      with which to continue the fight. Of all the minority’s demands,
      only one has not now been met—that discord should be
      brought into the Party’s Central Committee by the co-optation of
      minority men forcibly foisted upon it; yet the attacks of the
      minority are more vicious than ever. Having gained control of
      the Central Organ and the Party Council, the minority do not
      scruple to exploit in their circle interests the very discipline
      that they are in fact fighting.
     

      The position has become intolerable, impossible; to allow it to drag
      on any longer would be a positive crime.
     

      The first means of ending it, in our opinion, is complete clarity and
      frankness in Party relations. Amidst all this mud and fog there is no
      finding the true path. Every Party trend, every group must openly and
      definitely state what it thinks of the present position in the Party
      and what solution it desires. And that is what we are proposing to all

    

      comrades, to the representatives of all shades in the Party. The
      practical way out of the crisis, we consider, is the immediate
      summoning of the Third Party Congress. It alone can clarify the
      situation, settle the disputes, and confine the struggle within proper
      bounds. Without a congress all we can expect is the progressive
      disintegration of the Party.
     

      All the arguments brought against a congress are, we maintain,
      totally invalid.
     

      We are told that a congress would lead to a split. But why? If
      the minority are irreconcilable in their anarchistic leanings,
      if they are prepared to have a split rather than submit to the
      Party, then they have already virtually seceded from it, and to
      defer the inevitable formal split would be more than irrational:
      chained together, both sides would more and more senselessly
      dissipate their strength in wrangling and squabbling,
      exhausting themselves morally and growing ever pettier and
      shallower. But we do not grant the possibility of a split. In
      face of the real strength of the organised Party, the
      anarchistically minded elements are bound to, and we think will,
      bow in submission, fo  by their very nature they are incapable
      of constituting an independent force. It is argued that a
      reconciliation is possible without a congress. But what sort of
      reconciliation? Total surrender to the circle spirit,
      co-optation of the minority to the Central Committee, which
      would complete the disorganisation of the central
      institutions. That would make the Party nothing but a name, and
      the Party majority would be compelled to start the struggle
      anew. And the minority? They have used every concession hitherto
      won only as a buttress for their disruptive activities; even
      from their point of view, the struggle has far outgrown the
      bounds of a squabble over co-optation; how then can they
      discontinue it? And still less will they do so if they have not
      gained
      all their demands. We are told that a congress will not achieve
      its purpose because the differences have not yet been
      clarified. But are they being clarified now, is not the
      confusion growing worse confounded? Differences are not being
      clarified, but deliberately searched out and manufactured, and
      only a congress can put an end to this. It alone, by bringing
      the contending parties face to face and making them frankly and
      definitely state their objects,

    

      can thoroughly clarify the mutual relations between the
      different trends and forces in the Party. But, the minority
      declare, the congress may be manipulated by the breaking up of
      organisations. That is a lying insinuation, we reply, an
      insinuation unsupported by a single fact. If there were any such
      facts, we may be sure that the minority, being in possession of
      the Party organ, would have given them wide publicity, and,
      controlling the Party Council as they do, would have had ample
      opportunity to correct them. Lastly, the recent Council
      resolution, which points to no such facts in the past,
      completely rules out their possibility in the future. Who is now
      going to believe this far-fetched insinuation? Fears are
      expressed that a congress would divert too much of our forces
      and funds from positive work. What a bitter mockery! Can any
      greater diversion of forces and funds be imagined than that
      which the strife is producing? A congress is imperative! It
      would be imperative even if Party life had proceeded normally,
      in view of the exceptional historical juncture and the new tasks
      with which the world events may confront the Party. It is doubly
      imperative in the present Party crisis, in order to find an
      honest and reasonable way out of it, to preserve the forces of
      the Party and uphold its honour and dignity.
     

      What must the Third Congress do to put an end to the strife and
      restore Party life to normal? Most essential for this, in our view,
      are the following reforms, which we shall advocate and work for by
      every available loyal means:
     

      I. The editorship of the Central Organ to be handed over to the
      adherents of the Party majority. The need for this, in view of the
      manifest inability of the present editorial board to conduct the
      Central Organ as required by the general Party interests, has been
      sufficiently demonstrated. The organ of a circle cannot and must not
      be the organ of the Party.
     

      II. The relationship of the local organisation abroad (the League) to
      the all-Russia central body, the Central Commit tee, to be clearly
      defined. The present position of the League, which has converted
      itself into a second Party leader ship and manages its associated
      groups without any control, completely ignoring the Central Committee,
      is obviously abnormal and must be ended.
     
 

      III. The Rules to provide guarantees that Party struggles are
      conducted by Party methods. That this reform is essential is
      shown by the entire experience of the post-Congress struggle. It
      is necessary to include in the Party Rules guarantees of the
      rights of any minority, so that the disagreements,
      dissatisfactions, and irritations that will constantly and
      unavoidably arise may be diverted from the old, philistine,
      circle channels of rows and squabbling into the still
      unaccustomed channels of a constitutional and dignified struggle
      for one’s convictions. Among the conditions needed for such a
      change we class the following. The minority should be allowed
      one or more writers’ groups, with the right to be represented at
      congresses; the widest formal guarantees should be given as
      regards publication of Party literature criticising the
      activities of the central Party institutions. The right of the
      committees to receive (through the general Party transport
      system) the particular Party publications they desire should be
      formally recognised. The limits of the Central Committee’s right
      to influence the personal composition of the committees should
      be precisely defined. We consider it highly important that the
      arrangements for publication of minority literature which the
      Central Committee proposed to the minority of the Second
      Congress should be incorporated in the Rules, in order that the
      fantasy of a “state of siege” invented by the
      minority them selves may be dispelled, and that the inevitable
      internal struggles in the Party may be conducted in seemly forms
      and not allowed to interfere with positive work.
     

      We do not here elaborate our proposals in detail, for we are not
      putting forward draft Rules, but only a general programme of
      struggle for Party unity. We shall therefore only briefly
      indicate certain specific amendments to the Rules which are in
      our opinion desirable, without in any way binding ourselves as
      regards subsequent elaboration of the Rules, in the light of
      further experience. For example, it is necessary to reform the
      Party Council, as an institution which, in its present form,
      has proved in practice to be unfit for its function of
      co-ordinating and exercising supreme supervision over the
      activities of the central bodies. It should be made a body
      entirely elected by the Congress, instead of being a court where
      the Congress-elected fifth

    

      member sits as arbiter over the central bodies, which defend
      themselves through their delegates. Further, Paragraph I of
      the Rules should be revised, in line with the criticisms voiced in the
      Party, to define the Party’s boundaries more precisely, etc.
     

      In putting forward this programme of struggle for Party unity,
      we invite the representatives of all other shades and all Party
      organisations to make a clear statement of their own programmes,
      so as to permit of serious and systematic, conscious and
      methodical preparation for a congress. An issue involving the
      very life, the honour and dignity of the Party is at stake: is
      it an ideological and material force capable of sufficient
      rational self-organisation to act as the real leader of our
      country’s revolutionary working- class movement? By all their
      actions, the 6migr6 minority answer: No! And they continue to
      act in this way with confident assurance, banking on the
      remoteness of Russia, the frequent changes of workers there, and
      the indispensability of their own leaders and literary
      forces. Our Party is coming into being! —we answer, seeing
      the growing political understanding of the advanced workers,
      the vigorous activity of the committees in general Party
      life. Our Party is coming into being, we have ever more numerous
      young forces capable of replacing or reinvigorating old literary
      bodies which forfeit the Party’s confidence; we have ever more
      revolutionaries who prize the consistent Party trend above any
      circle of former leaders. Our Party is coming into being, and no
      subterfuges or delays can hold back its decided and final
      verdict.
     

      From these forces in our Party we derive our certainty of victory.
     

      Comrades, reprint and distribute this appeal!

      This conference of twenty-two Bolsheviks, under Lenin’s leadership, was held
      in Switzerland in August (New Style) 1904. Nineteen persons actually
      attended, and three others subscribed to its decisions. The present appeal
      “To the Party”, adopted by the conference, became the
      Bolsheviks’ programme of struggle for the convening
      of the Third Party Congress.

      August 18, 1904
     

      To Members of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., Glebov,

 Konyagin,[1]
      Traviusky,
      Loshad, and Osipov.
     

      I was informed today, through the Central Committee’s Berlin agent, of
      the decisions taken by four (?) members of the Central Committee at
      their meeting in

 Russia.[2] I
      cannot acknowledge these
      decisions lawfully adopted, for the following reasons:
     

      1) The statement at the beginning of the resolution that the
      meeting was attended by all Central Committee members but one
      (that is, myself) is not true. After the arrest of
      Vasilyev and Zverev and the resignation of

 Mitrofanov,[3]
      the Central Committee still has another
      member—Comrade Osipov. The rumours of his resignation have
      proved false: Comrade Osipov himself considers that he is a
      member of the Central Committee. That was also the view of
      Vasilyev (who wrote to me about it), Zverev, and myself. In any
      case, the four Central Committee members had no right to declare
      Osipov no longer a member without first clarifying the matter of
      his alleged resignation. It has to be added that neither I nor
      the Central Organ nor any of the Central Committee’s foreign
      agents was ever formally notified of Osipov’s resignation. Yet
      Osipov was not invited to the meeting.
     

      2) I too, so far from being invited to the meeting, was not even
      informed of it or notified of the matters to be discussed. The
      Central Committee has of course the right to decide matters by a
      majority vote, but its decisions cannot be lawful unless all
      members have been given the opportunity to share

    

      in the proceedings and, if necessary, enter a dissenting opinion. I
      was denied that opportunity altogether unlawfully.
     

      3) The four Central Committee members have not stated their attitude
      to the agreement of May 26, 1904, between Glebov and myself,
      although that agreement and my accompanying letter were, with
      Glebov and Zverev’s consent, sent to all members of the Central
      Committee with the request to give me a direct answer. The majority
      on the Central Committee are fully entitled to overrule the
      minority, but certainly not to evade official inquiries by the
      minority and issues expressly raised by the minority for
      discussion.
     

      4) In view of the above I demand an immediate answer from the four
      Central Committee members to the following:
      a) on what grounds was Comrade Osipov, a member of the Central
      Committee, not invited to the meeting? b) ditto as regards myself; c)
      do they recognise that the majority of a body has the right to adopt
      decisions in the name of the body as a whole only if the minority has
      been invited to the proceedings and given the opportunity to state its
      views and enter a dissenting opinion? d) do they recognise
      their obligation to give an answer on the substance of all the
      issues raised in the agreement of May 26, 1904?
     

      5) Since the four Central Committee members have communicated
      their unlawfully adopted decisions (as supposed decisions of the
      whole Central Committee) to the Central Organ, I am obliged to
      address a letter regarding their mode of procedure to Party
      workers whom this matter rather closely concerns.

      Lenin is speaking of the “July Declaration”—a resolution adopted
      in the name of the Central Committee in July 1904 by the concilia tor
      members Krasin, Noskov (Glebov), and Galperin; it was pub lished in
      Iskra, No. 72 (August 25, 1904) under the title “Statement by
      the Central Committee”. In this resolution the conciliators rec
      ognised as legitimate the Plekhanov-co-opted Menshevik editorial board of
      Iskra and defended the opportunism of the Mensheviks; they co-opted
      to the Central Committee three other concil iators—Lyubimov, Karpov,
      and Dubrovinsky; they came out against convening the Third Party Congress
      and dissolved the Central Committee’s Southern Bureau, which had been
      agitating for a congress. They deprived Lenin of the powers of foreign
      represent ative of the Central Committee and forbade his writings to be
      published without their sanction.

     

      The adoption of the “July Declaration” meant total betrayal of
      the Second Party Congress decisions and the open defection of the
      conciliators on the Central Committee to the side of the Mensheviks.

      Comrades,
 

      The conflict within the Central Committee has reached such a
      pitch that I consider myself morally obliged to bring it to the 
      knowledge of all who support the Second Party Congress
      majority. I am compelled to do so both by the unlawful
      proceedings of four members of the Central Committee and by the
      fear of again taking some incautious step harmful to the Party
      (such as my resignation from the editorial board) unless I
      consult like-minded comrades who are working on the spot, who
      have a better knowledge of the real sentiment in the Party, and
      who have in fact, and not merely in word, declared war on the
      old 6migr6 circle spirit in the name of the young party spirit.
     

      What the conflict within the Central Committee consists in will
      be seen from the four appended documents:
1) the agreement of
      May 26, 1904, between three Central Commit tee
      members—Gleboy, Zverev, and Lenin;
2) my letter of the
      same date to the members of the Central Committee;
3) a
      resolution allegedly adopted by all members of the Central
      Committee but one;
4) my protest impeaching the lawfulness of
      this alleged
 resolution.[1]


      I would earnestly request all like-minded comrades in the present
      struggle in the Party to read these instructive documents carefully,
      and frankly and unreservedly state their opinion concerning them. I
      for my part shall refrain from any public statement in the press on
      these issues, at least for a time, until I know the views of some of
      those

    

      working in Russia, or until compelled to such a statement by events.
     

      I shall confine myself here to a few questions to the Party, if
      the members of our organisations find that we do in fact have a
      party:
1) can a working-class party worthy of the name tolerate
      a Central Committee, elected by the majority, that proclaims
      the policy of the majority to be a “group’  policy?
2) are
      people morally entitled to our confidence who in a declaration
      written in March say one thing and in July quite
      another?—3) people who take advantage of the arrest of two
      majority members of the Central Committee to trample on the
      interests of the majority?—4) people who in the name of
      combating group policies talk of a conference with the minority
      group, ignoring the majority?—5) people who are afraid of
      having their actions judged by a congress, and for that reason
      dare to intimidate the Party with the prospect of a split and to
      “forbid” Party members their elementary right of
      agitating for a congress?—6) people so childishly
      incapable of understanding our Party crisis that they insist
      in all seriousness on the “legitimacy” of
      the Central Organ and decree the “high
      standard” of that Central Organ?—7) people who,
      in deliberate defiance of the will of the Party, try to oust
      consistent adherents of the Party majority from the Central
      Committee?
     

      I conclude with the request for an answer to these questions and for
      steps to be taken to acquaint all active Party members with the
      situation and with this letter. I don’t think there is any necessity
      for the present of publishing the letter.
     

      Central Committee member Lenin

      September 11, 1904
     

      Dear Comrade,
     

      You again repeat that the wish that I join the editorial hoard
      of the Central Organ was expressed “by the Central
      Committee”. And I for my part must repeat that this is, to
      say the least, inaccurate. When you formally stated that the
      Central Committee’s declaration had been adopted unanimously by
      a meeting of all its members but one, I replied immediately
      (August 18,1904) that this was not true. The declaration was
      signed by three Central Committee

 members[5]
      out of
      the recent total of nine; and these three quite unlawfully
      proclaimed Comrade Osipov no longer a member of the Central
      Committee, whereas he informed me in writing that he still
      considered himself a member. It was unlawful to declare that a
      comrade had resigned without having discussed the matter with
      him. Both the arguments with which you and your two colleagues
      tried to justify this unlawful act are patently unsound. You
      said that Comrade Osipov had formally announced his resignation
      at the preceding regular meeting of the Central Committee. That
      is not true, for at the end of May (that is, months after that
      meeting, which took place in February or March) the Central
      Commit tee still counted nine members, as is certified by the
      agreement of May 26, 1904, signed by three members of the
      Central Committee, and the letter appended to that

      agreement.[1]

      You said that after that Central Committee meeting Comrade
      Osipov had joined one of the local committees, which a member
      of the Central Committee would have had no right to do.

    

      Comrade Osipov had already written to me on this point, stating
      that he had gone to take part in the local work in the district
      in question on the instructions of those very members of the
      Central Committee who now declare that he has re signed, and
      that he had not worked as a formal member of the
      committee. Besides, even if it were a fact that a member of the
      Central Committee had irregularly and in contravention of the
      Rules joined a local committee, it does not at all follow that
      to correct this irregularity he had necessarily to resign from
      the Central Committee, and not from the local committee. Lastly,
      you yourself had to admit in your letter to me that the meeting
      of the three Central Committee members was informed that Comrade
      Osipov’s resignation was a disputed matter. That this disputed
      matter should have been decided by three Central Committee
      members in the absence of Osipov, and without even hearing his
      opinion, was a patent and outrageous piece of lawlessness. Of
      course, the three Central Committee members could count on the
      support of the Party Council, which is controlled by the
      editors; of course, the three Central Committee members could
      rely on their formal or tacit compact with the minority
      adherents on the Council. But that does not make their action
      lawful; on the contrary, it aggravates its unlawfulness by
      elements of political bad faith. Similarly, it was unlawful for
      the three Central Committee members to accept the resignation of
      Comrade Travinsky, of which all members of the Central Committee
      had not been informed prior to the meeting. To this day you have
      not been able to tell me exactly when this resignation was
      tendered, and to whom. You disposed of the matter with a reply
      that sounded like a sneer: “Make inquiries of the
      collegium in Russia”—that is, the “collegium”
      (that very same collegium of three!) from which you had just
      come and with which I have no means of communicating except
      through you!!
     

      Hence, I challenge the lawfulness of the composition of the
      Central Committee and of its last meeting (at which the
      “declaration” was adopted). I should therefore be
      fully entitled to leave unanswered your proposal that I join the
      editorial board of the Central Organ. But I regard this proposal
      as coming not from the Central Committee but from three
      members of the Party, and consider it my duty to

    

      give a reasoned reply, the more so since you say it is the wish of the
      editors of the Central Organ, stated to you in writing, to have me on
      the editorial board.
     

      You suggest that my joining the editorial board of the Central
      Organ “would secure almost complete peace in the Party,
      which you are so anxious to have”. This
      “almost” of yours is highly significant! Yes, I am
      anxious to have peace in the Party. I made an offer of peace in
      printed form in December 1903, in my “Letter to the
      Editors of Iskra (Why I Resigned from the Editorial

      Board)”.[2]

      I made another offer of peace, officially, in the
      Party Council in January

1904.[3]

Peace was not accepted
      on the terms I offered then on behalf of the majority. I may
      remark that, contrary to the present fashion of mouthing
      hypocritical phrases about “peace”, when by peace is
      meant complete sur render to the minority, complete ignoring of
      the majority, and complete oblivion of the Congress, I said
      quite definitely in the Council what I understood by peace in
      the Party. With my then fellow delegate from the Central
      Committee on the Council, I plainly stated that by peace I meant
      purging the ideological struggle of all contention over post and
      place, of all squabbling and underhand methods of fighting. Let
      the minority have the Central Organ and the majority the Central
      Committee, I proposed then, let us call on everyone to stop all
      boycotts and all squabbling over posts and co optation and argue
      out our differences and the causes of our divergence at the
      Congress in a comradely manner; let us train the Party to
      discuss its internal disagreements in an honest and dignified
      way. My appeal was ridiculed by Plekhanov and Martov. I am not
      surprised that they took the disgraceful decision to withhold
      publication of the Council minutes (in spite of the insistence
      of the minority of the Council, namely, the two representatives
      of the Central Committee), or that the three Central Committee
      members have now (clandestinely) endorsed that decision. People
      who would arrange a hypocritical peace, taking advantage of the
      accidents unavoidable in the lives of Russian revolutionaries
      and ousting from the Central Committee those who

    

      think differently from

 themselves,[4]

      are bound to want to conceal from
      the Party membership a timely attempt to achieve an honest
      peace. Fortunately, I have reason to believe that this miserable trick
      to deceive the Party will not succeed and that the Council minutes
      will see the light after all.
     

      When the editors who had usurped control of the Council
      scornfully rejected my offer of peace, I declared then and there
      that I considered a congress the only honest way out. The
      tactics of the minority (including Plekhanov)—to keep
      control of the editorial board of the Central Organ and the
      Council and claim to represent on these central bodies the
      interests of the Party as a whole while in fact trying to
      secure, without a congress, a remodelling of the Central
      Committee in the interests of the minority—such tactics I
      cannot regard as honest fighting. I have never entered, and do
      not deem it possible to enter, into any bargains with people who
      follow such tactics. Besides, since January the complexion of
      the new Iskra has become quite clear; it is a central
      organ of tittle-tattle and squabbling, of muddled thinking and
      of flirting with the opportunists, of settling personal scores
      and searching out points of difference. That the new
      Iskra is the organ of a circle, the organ of a new
      “trend”, is now clear to everyone, even to the
      editors themselves, who initially set themselves up as champions
      of “continuity” and now systematically drag the old
      Iskra through the mire. And so, in what sense can one
      now speak of peace? If by peace is meant purging the ideological
      struggle of squabbles over co-optation, I am still quite
      ready to agree to peace and to renew the proposal I made in the
      Council. But if by peace is meant cessation of the ideological
      struggle, conciliation with the line, or rather with the
      complexion of the new Iskra, for it has no such thing
      as a line, then such a “peace   can only be pro posed by
      unprincipled or hypocritical people, or by people for whom the
      organs of the Party are so much newsprint
      (Druckerschwt’jrze, printer’s ink, as one of the
      “conciliators” called the writings of the new
      Iskra). If the editors of the

    

      new Iskra, whose position of “principle”
      has amounted almost entirely to personal attacks on me, to a hue
      and cry against what they have dubbed “Leninism”,
      and to a searching out of differences with me, now express the
      wish to have me on the editorial board, they are only admitting
      thereby that they do not take their own writings seriously, that
      they invented the whole controversy just “for the sake of
      co-optation” and are prepared to throw all their new
      “principles” overboard once co-optation has been
      secured. As for me, I reject as unworthy the very suggestion
      that the majority could give up a Party struggle for its
      position, for the consistent line, against the circle spirit. In
      common with all principled supporters of the majority, whose
      numbers in Russia are growing, I consider it my inalienable
      right and duty to carry on this struggle. And it should, in my
      view, be carried on openly, for nine-tenths of the history of
      the conflict is already public knowledge and any further
      attempts to conceal it from the eyes of the world would only be
      a petty and senseless prolonging of the crisis.
     

      You write that “numerous committees, too, undoubtedly
      wish” to see me join the present Iskra editorial
      board. I note with regret that here too you are uttering a
      deliberate untruth. In the present circumstances of the
      struggle, not one committee has up to now expressed any such
      wish. It has only been expressed by the editorial circle of the
      Central Organ and by three members of the Central Committee, who
      consider it the acme of political wisdom to join the minority
      in abusing the majority and the majority in abusing the
      minority. I make bold to believe that my duty is to heed, not
      the will of any group of politicians, but the will of the entire
      Party, which has also laid down the method of giving formal
      expression to that will, viz., the congress. I make bold to
      believe that a leader who adopts a certain line at the congress
      and leads a section of the Party along that line forfeits every
      claim to respect or even to having his words taken seriously if
      he then deserts to the side of his opponents.
     

      Your reference to “numerous committees” is very
      instructive and significant, in spite of its ... divergence from
      the truth. It points to a shred of Party conscience, to some little

    

      recognition of the fact that official institutions appointed by
      the Party must take cognisance of the Party’s will when they
      undertake to revise the composition and line of the central
      bodies. If this recognition were not obscured in you by the
      confused position you have adopted, you would have no difficulty
      in seeing that there is no other way of really ascertaining the
      real wishes of really numerous committees than by convening a
      congress. But while your reference to “numerous
      committees” betrays a shred of Party conscience, it also
      points very clearly to an uneasy conscience. You fear a congress
      like the plague because you realise that your policy of
      adventures glaringly conflicts with the will of the Party.
     

      My general views as to the hypocrisy of your peace-making are
      fully borne out by a number of additional facts. The three
      Central Committee members now admire the “high
      standard” of the Central Organ, while in March these
      very same three members of the Central Committee drew up a
      statement expressing regret that certain Party writers (the
      majority of the present editorial board of the Central Organ)
      should have lapsed into opportunism. While talking about
      “peace”, these three Central Committee members
      dissolve the Southern Bureau (an agent body of the Central
      Committee) because majority adherents have been working on it
      and have had the audacity to agitate for a congress. While
      talking about reconciling the two contending sides, the three
      Central Committee members arrange a conference with
      representatives of one side, ignoring the other. What
      demoralisation is
      brought into the Party by these private, hole-and-corner
      transactions, which affect the whole Party’s vital interests and
      which are so carefully kept from its knowledge, when there is
      absolutely no necessity for secrecy precautions! How much mutual
      distrust and suspicion is brought into the Party’s whole life by
      these tricks behind the back of the Party! Only today I received
      a letter from a comrade in Russia describing the rumours that
      are circulating in connection with these transactions: it is
      said in Party circles that three sections have developed among
      the minority; one insists on the co-optation of Dan and Trotsky
      to the Central Committee, and will not hear of anything else;
      the second agrees to a conference; the third contents itself
      with the Central Committee’s declaration, and this section
      includes

    

      the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists (who quite rightly interpret t
      he starting of a popular organ as nothing but a masked re
      establishment of Yuzhny Rabochy, which the Congress
      closed down). I do not know what truth there is in this Party
      gossip. But that the minority consists of heterogeneous groups,
      that Comrade Brouckbre, for example, probably takes no part at
      all in the minority’s “ultimatums” or the
      co-optation squabble generally, and that the Yuzhny
      Rabochy group represents quite a distinct shade—these
      are all generally known facts, with which everyone who has
      studied our Party Congress is familiar. Can you really not see
      how degrading is all this huckstering of various groups behind
      the back of the Party? Is it surprising that the hypocrisy of
      the three Central Committee members is earning them the utter
      distrust of the majority, which stands aloof from all this
      trickery? Is it surprising that a “peace”
      inaugurated by dismissing people who agitate for a congress
      should be regarded as a prelude to the systematic faking of
      Party opinion? Is it surprising that the majority should suspect
      a deal between the Central Committee and the Central Organ (and,
      consequently, the Council) to force minority adherents upon the
      committees, to withhold publication of majority resolutions (the
      St. Petersburg and Ekaterinoslav resolutions have been withheld
      for months already), etc., etc.?
     

      I hope you will now understand why, with the present situation in the
      Party, there can be no thought of my joining the editorial board of
      the Central Organ.
     


      Your statement that I “abstained” from voting on the
      co optation of three new members to the Central Committee is
      not true. I emphatically protest against considering
      “the elections as valid”. This is another piece of
      lawlessness. It is the duty of all three
      Central Committee members to consider my protest, and only
      after that can they raise the question of
      co-optation. According to the Rules, co-optation must be
      unanimous; my consent has not been given. Consequently, without
      the matter being taken to the Council there can be no talk of
      the co-optation being valid. The decision of the Council (if you
      unlawfully take the co optation issue there before a scrutiny of
      the composition of

    

      the Central Committee has been made by all its members) must be sent
      to me together with the Council minutes.
     


      I cannot share your regret at our not having met. After your tricks
      with regard to Comrade Osipov and your attitude to your pledged word
      (agreement of May 26, 1904), I do not wish to have anything to do with
      you except in a purely official way, and only in writing.
     

      Central Committee member N. Lenin

      This applies in the first place to Comrade Osipov, and secondly to
      me too, of course, for to propose that I join the editorial board of
      the Central Organ amounts to proposing that I resign from the
      Central Committee.

      Comrade Rosa Luxemburg’s article in Nos. 42 and 43 of the
Neue Zeit is a criticism of my Russian book on the
crisis in our

Party.[1]

I cannot but thank our German
      comrades for their attention to our Party literature and their
      attempts to acquaint German Social-Democrats with it, but I must
      point out that Rosa Luxemburg’s Neue Zeit article does
      not acquaint the reader with my book, but with something
      else. This may be seen from the following instances. Comrade
      Luxemburg says, for example, that my book is a clear and
      detailed expression of the point of view of “intransigent
      centralism”. Comrade Luxemburg thus supposes that I defend
      one system of organisation against another. But actually that is
      not so. From the first to the last page of my book, I defend the
      elementary principles of any conceivable system of party
      organisation: My book is not concerned with the difference
      between one system of organisation and another, but with how
      any system is to be maintained, criticised, and rectified in a
      manner consistent with the party idea. Rosa Luxemburg further
      says that “according to his [Lenin’s] conception, the
      Central Committee has the right to organise all the local Party
      committees”. Actually that is not so. What my views on
      this subject are can be documentarily proved by the draft Rules
      of Party Organisation which I proposed. In that draft there is
      nothing about any right to organise the local committees. That
      right was introduced into the Party Rules by the commission
      elected by the Party Congress to frame them, and the Congress

      adopted the commission’s text. But besides myself and one other
      majority adherent, the commission included three members of the
      Congress minority, so that in this commission which gave the
      Central Committee the right to organise the local committees, it
      was my opponents that had the upper hand. Comrade Luxemburg has
      confused two different things. In the first place, she has
      confused my organisational draft with the modified draft of the
      commission and with the Rules of Organisation as actually
      adopted by the Congress; secondly, she has confused the defence
      of a specific point relating to a specific clause of the Rules
      (in that defence I was by no means intransigent, for I did not
      object at the plenary session to the amendment made by the
      commission) with the defence of the thesis (truly
      “ultra-centralist”, is it not?) that Rules adopted
      by a Party congress must be adhered to until amended by a
      subsequent congress. This thesis (a “purely
      Blanquist” one, as the reader may readily observe) I did
      indeed defend in my book quite
      “intransigently”. Comrade Luxemburg says that in my
      view “the
      Central Committee is the only active nucleus of the
      Party”. Actually that is not so. I have never advocated
      any such view. On the contrary, my opponents (the Second Party
      Congress minority) charged in their writings that I did not
      sufficiently uphold the independence of the Central Committee,
      that I made it too subordinate to the editorial board of the
      Central Organ and the Party Council, bodies located abroad. To
      these charges I replied in my book that when the Party majority
      had the upper hand in the Party Council, the latter never made
      any attempt to interfere with the Central Committee’s
      independence, but that when the Party council became a weapon of
      the minority, this did immediately hap pen. Comrade Rosa
      Luxemburg says that there are no two opinions among the Russian
      Social-Democrats as to the need for a united party, and that the
      whole controversy is over the degree of centralisation. Actually
      that is not so. If Comrade Luxemburg had taken the trouble to
      acquaint her self with the resolutions of the many local Party
      committees that constitute the majority, she would readily have
      seen (which incidentally is also clear from my book) that our
      controversy has principally been over whether the Central
      Committee and Central Organ should represent the trend of

    

      the majority of the Party Congress, or whether they should
      not. About this “ultra-centralist” and “purely
      Blanquist” demand the worthy comrade says not a word, she
      prefers to declaim against mechanical subordination of the part
      to the whole, against slavish submission, blind obedience, and
      other such bogeys. I am very grateful to Comrade Luxemburg for
      explaining the profound idea that slavish submission is very
      harmful to the Party, but I should like to know: does the
      comrade consider it normal for supposed party central
      institutions to be dominated by the minority of the Party
      Congress?—can she imagine such a thing?—has she ever
      seen it in any party? Comrade Luxemburg fathers on me the idea
      that all the conditions already exist in Russia for forming a
      large and extremely centralised workers’ party. Again an error
      of fact. Nowhere in my book did I voice such an idea, let alone
      advocate it. The thesis I advanced expressed and expresses
      something else: I insisted, namely, that all the conditions
      already existed for expecting Party Congress decisions to be
      observed, and that the time was past when a Party institution
      could be supplanted by a private circle. I brought proof that
      certain academics in our Party had shown themselves inconsistent
      and unstable, and that they had no right to lay the blame for
      their own lack of discipline upon the Russian proletarians. The
      Russian workers have already pronounced repeatedly, on various
      occasions, for observance of the Party Congress decisions. It is
      nothing short of laughable when Comrade Luxemburg proclaims such
      a view “optimistic” (should it not rather be
      considered “pessimistic”?) without uttering a single word
      about
      the factual basis of my thesis. Comrade Luxemburg declares that
      I glorify the educational influence of the factory. That is not
      so. It was my opponent, not I, who said that I pictured the
      Party as a factory. I properly ridiculed him and proved with his
      own words that he confused two different aspects of factory
      discipline, which, unfortunately, is the case with Comrade
      Luxemburg

      too.[2]


      Comrade Luxemburg says that I characterised my stand point more
      acutely, perhaps, than any of my opponents could

    

      have done when I defined a revolutionary Social-Democrat as a
      Jacobin who has identified himself with the organisation of the
      class-conscious workers. Yet another error of fact. It was
      P. Axelrod, not I, who first started talking about
      Jacobinism. He was the first to liken our Party trends to those
      of the days of the great French Revolution. I merely observed
      that the parallel could only be allowed in the sense that the
      division of present-day Social-Democracy into a revolutionary
      and an opportunist wing corresponded to some extent to the
      division into Montagnards and Girondists. The old
      Iskra, which the Party Congress endorsed, often drew
      such a parallel. Just because it recognised this division, the
      old Iskra fought against the opportunist wing in our
      Party, against the Rabocheye Dyelo trend. Rosa
      Luxemburg here confuses comparison of the two
      revolutionary
      trends of the eighteenth and the twentieth century with
      identification of those trends. If I say, for example, that the
      Jungfrau stands in the same relation to the Little Scheidegg as a
      house of four storeys to one of two, that does not mean I
      identify a four-storey house with the Jungfrau. Comrade
      Luxemburg leaves completely out of sight the factual analysis of
      the different trends in our Party. Yet the greater half of my book
      is devoted precisely to this analysis, based on the minutes of
      our Party Congress, and in the preface I call special attention
      to the fact. Rosa Luxemburg sets out to talk about the present
      position in our Party while totally ignoring our Congress, which
      was what really laid our Party’s foundation. A rash enterprise,
      it has to be said!  Particularly since I point out a hundred
      times in my book that my opponents ignore our Party Congress and
      by so doing leave all their assertions devoid of all foundation
      of fact.
     

      Comrade Luxemburg commits exactly the same basic error. She
      repeats naked words without troubling to grasp their concrete
      meaning. She raises bogeys without informing herself of the
      actual issue in the controversy. She puts in my mouth
      commonplaces, general principles and conceptions, absolute
      truths, and tries to pass over the relative truths, pertaining
      to perfectly definite facts, with which alone I operate. And
      then she rails against set formulas and invokes the dialectics
      of Marx! It is the worthy comrade’s own article that consists of
      nothing but manufactured

    

      formulas and runs counter to the ABC of dialectics. This ABC
      tells us that there is no such thing as abstract truth, truth is
      always concrete. Comrade Rosa Luxemburg loftily ignores the
      concrete facts of our Party struggle and engages in
      grandiloquent declamation about matters which it is impossible
      to discuss seriously. Let me cite one last example from Comrade
      Luxemburg’s second article. She quotes my remark that the way
      the Rules of Organisation are formulated can make them a more or
      a less trenchant weapon against

     opportunism.[3]

Just what
      formulations I talked about in my book and all of us talked
      about at the Congress, of that she does not say a word. What the
      controversy at the Party Congress was, and against whom I
      advanced my theses, she does not touch on in the
      slightest. Instead, she favours me with a whole lecture on
      opportunism ... in the parliamentary countries!! But about the
      peculiar, specific varieties of opportunism in Russia, the
      shades which it has taken on there and with which my book is
      concerned, we find not a word in her article. The upshot of all
      these very brilliant arguments is:

      “Party Rules are not meant in themselves [?? understand
      this who can!] to be a weapon of resistance to opportunism, but
      only an outward instrument for exerting the dominant influence
      of the actually existing revolutionary-proletarian majority of
      the Party.” Quite so. But how this actually existing majority
      of our Party was formed Rosa Luxemburg does not say, yet that is
      exactly what I talk about in my book. Nor does she say what
      influence it was that Plekhanov and I defended with the help of
      this outward instrument. I can only add that never and nowhere
      have I talked such nonsense as that the Party Rules are a weapon
      “in themselves”.
     

      The best way to answer this kind of presentation of my views will be
      to set forth the concrete facts of our Party struggle. Anyone will
      then be able to see how ill Comrade Luxemburg’s abstract commonplaces
      and formulas sort with the concrete facts.
     

      Our Party was founded in Russia in the spring of l898 at a congress
      of representatives of several Russian organisations. It was named the
      Russian Social-Democratic Labour

    

      Party, Rabochaya

Gazeta[6]
was made the Central Organ, and the
      Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad became the Party’s
      foreign representative. Very soon after the congress, the
      Central Committee of the Party was arrested. Rabochaya
      Gazeta had to cease publication after its second issue. The
      whole Party became a shapeless conglomeration of local Party
      organisations (known as committees). The only bond between these
      local committees was an ideological, purely spiritual one. A
      period of disunity, vacillation, and splits was bound to set in
      again. The intellectuals, who in our Party made up a much larger
      percentage than in the West-European parties, had taken up
      Marxism as a new vogue. This vogue very soon gave place to
      slavish acceptance of the bourgeois criticism of Marx, on the
      one hand, and an infatuation for a purely trade-unionist labour
      movement (strike-ism—Economism), on the other. The
      divergence between the intellectual-opportunist and proletarian-
      revolutionary trends led to a split in the Union Abroad. The
      newspaper Rabochaya Mysl, and the Rabocheye
      Dyelo magazine published abroad, expressed (the latter
      in somewhat lesser degree) the standpoint of Economism, they
      belittled the importance of political struggle and denied the
      existence of a bourgeois-democratic element in Russia. The
      “legal” critics of Marx—Messrs. Struve,
      Tugan-Baranovsky, Bulgakov, Berdyaev, and the rest—swung
      all the way to the Right. Nowhere in Europe do we find
      Bernsteinism arriving so speedily at its logical
      consummation—the formation of a liberal group—as was
      the case in Russia. There, Mr. Struve began with
      “criticism” in the name of Bernsteinism and ended by
      setting up the liberal magazine Osvobozhdeniye, liberal
      in the European sense of the term. Plekhanov and his friends,
      who broke away from the Union Abroad, met with support from the
      founders of Iskra and Zarya. These two
      publications waged (even Comrade Luxemburg has heard something
      about that) a “brilliant three-year campaign” against the
      opportunist wing of the Party, a campaign of the Social
      Democratic “Mountain” against the Social-Democratic
      “Gironde” (the expression belongs to the old
      Iskra), a campaign against Rabocheye Dyelo
      (Comrades Krichevsky, Akimov, Martynov, and others), against the
      Jewish Bund, against the organisations in Russia that eagerly
      espoused this trend

    

      (notably the St. Petersburg so-called Workers’ Organisation and the
      Voronezh Committee).
     

      It became more and more obvious that the purely ideological
      bond between the committees was not enough. The need to create a
      really united party, that is, to effect what was only
      foreshadowed in 1898, asserted itself more and more
      insistently. Finally, at the end of 1902 an Organising Committee
      was formed to convene the Second Party Congress. This
      Organising Committee, which was largely set up by the
      Iskra organisation in Russia, also included a
      representative of the Jewish Bund. In the autumn of 1903 the
      Second Congress was at last held; it ended, on the one hand, in
      the Party’s formal unification, and on the other, in a split
      into “majority” and “minority”. That
      division did not exist before the Congress. Only a detailed
      analysis of the struggle at the Congress can explain this
      division. Unfortunately, the sup porters of the minority
      (including Comrade Luxemburg) shy away fearfully from any such
      analysis.
     

      In my book, presented to the German reader by Comrade Luxemburg in
      such a singular manner, I devote over a hundred pages to a close
      study of the Congress minutes (which make up a volume of some 400
      pages). This analysis caused me to divide the delegates, or rather
      votes (we had delegates with one vote and with two), into four main
      groups:
      1) majority Iskra-ists (adherents of the trend of the old
      Iskra) —twenty-four votes;
2) minority
      Iskra-ists—nine votes;
3) “Centre” (also referred
      to ironically as the “Marsh”)—ten votes; and, lastly,
      4) anti-Iskra-ists—eight votes, making fifty-one votes in
      all. I analyse the part played by these groups in all the
      voting at the Congress, and prove that on all issues (of programme,
      of tactics, and of organisation) the Congress was an arena of
      struggle between the Iskra-ists and the anti-Iskra-ists,
      with the “Marsh” making various zigzags. Anyone even
      slightly familiar with our Party’s history is bound to see that it
      could not have been other wise. But all supporters of the minority
      (including Rosa Luxemburg) modestly close their eyes to this
      struggle. Why? Because this struggle makes manifest the utter
      falsity of the minority’s present political position. Throughout
      the struggle at the Party Congress, on dozens of questions, in
      dozens of votes, the Iskra-ists fought the anti-Iskra-ists

    

      and the “Marsh”, which sided the more definitely
      with the anti-Iskra-ists, the more concrete the matter at issue,
      the more positively it affected the fundamentals of Social-
      Democratic activity, the more tangibly it involved putting into
      practice the old Iskra’s long-standing plans. The ant
      i-Iskra-ists (particularly Comrade Akimov and the
      St. Petersburg Workers’ Organisation delegate, Comrade
      Brouck re, who always agreed with him, and nearly always Comrade
      Martynov and the five delegates of the Jewish Bund) were against
      recognising the trend of the old Iskra. They defended
      the old separate organisations and voted against their
      subordination to the Party, their fusion into the Party (the
      Organising Committee incident, the dissolution of the Yuzhny
      Rabochy group—the leading group of the
      “Marsh”, and so on). They fought against
      centralistic Rules of Organisation (14th sitting of the
      Congress) and accused all the Iskra-ists at
      that time of wanting to introduce “organised
      distrust”, “emergency laws”, and other such
      horrors. All the Iskra-ists, without
      exception, laughed at it then; it is remarkable that Comrade
      Rosa Luxemburg should now take these bogeys seriously. On the
      great majority of questions the Iskra-ists carried the
      day; they predominated at the Congress, as is clear from the
      figures given above. But during the second half of the Congress,
      when less fundamental issues were being decided, the
      anti-Iskra-ists had the better of it—some of the
      Iskra-ists voted with them. That was the case, for
      example, with regard to proclaiming equality to all languages
      in our programme; on this point the anti-Iskra-ists nearly
      succeeded in defeating the Programme Committee and getting their
      formulation carried. It was also the case over Paragraph I of
      the Rules, when the anti Iskra-ists and the
      “Marsh” put through Martov’s formulation. According
      to this formulation, Party members are not only those who belong
      to Party organisations (the formulation defended by Plekhanov
      and myself), but also all persons working under the control of
      Party

 organisations.[4]
   

     
 

      The same thing happened in the elections to the Central
      Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ. The
      compact majority consisted of 24 Iskra-ists, and they
      put through the long since planned reconstitution of the
      editorial board; of the six former editors, three were
      elected. The minority consisted of nine Iskra-ists, ten
      members of the “Centre”, and one anti-Iskra-ist (the
      other seven anti Iskra-ists, representing the Jewish
      Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo, had withdrawn from the
      Congress by then). This minority was so displeased with the
      elections that it decided to take no part in the rest of the
      elections. Comrade Kautsky was quite right when he said that the
      reconstitution of the editorial board was the main cause of the
      struggle that followed. But his view that I (sic!)
      “expelled” three comrades from the editorial board
      can only be attributed to his being totally uninformed about our
      Congress. In the first place, non-election is far from the same
      thing as expulsion, and I certainly had no power at the Congress
      to expel anyone; and secondly, Comrade Kautsky seems to have no
      inkling that the fact of a coalition between the
      anti-Iskra-ists,the “Centre”, and a small section of
      the Iskra adherents had political implications too and
      could not fail to influence the outcome of the elections. Anyone
      who does not wilfully close his eyes to what happened at our
      Congress is bound to see that our new division into minority and
      majority is only a variant of the old division into a
      proletarian-revolutionary and an intellectual-opportunist wing
      of our Party. That is a fact, and there is no explaining or
      laughing it away.
     

      Unfortunately, after the Congress the principles involved in this
      division were obscured by squabbling over co-optation: the minority
      would not work under the control of the central institutions unless
      the three ex-editors were again co-opted. This fight went on for two
      months. The weapons used were boycott and disruption of the
      Party. Twelve committees (out of the fourteen that spoke out on the
      subject) severely condemned these methods of struggle. The minority
      would not even accept the proposal, made

    

      by Plekhanov and myself, that they should set forth their point
      of view in Iskra. At the Congress of the League Abroad
      the thing was carried to the length of showering the members of
      the central bodies with personal insults and abuse (autocrats,
      bureaucrats, gendarmes, liars, etc., etc.). They were accused of
      suppressing individual initiative and wanting to introduce
      slavish submission, blind obedience, and so on. Plekhanov’s
      attempts to characterise these minority methods of struggle as
      anarchistic did not avail. After this Congress Plekhanov came
      out with his epoch-making article against me, “What Should
      Not Be Done” (in No. 52 of Iskra). In this
      article he said that fighting revisionism did not necessarily
      mean fighting the revisionists; and it was clear to all that he
      was referring to our minority. He further said that one should
      not always fight the anarchistic individualism so deeply
      ingrained in the Russian revolutionary, that at times some
      concessions were a better way to subdue it and avoid a split. I
      resigned from the editorial board as I could not share this
      view, and the minority editors were co-opted. Then followed a
      fight for co-optation to the Central Committee. My offer to
      conclude peace on the basis of the minority keeping the Central
      Organ and the majority the Central Committee was rejected. The
      fight went on, they were fighting “on principle”
      against bureaucracy, ultra-centralism, formalism, Jacobinism,
      Schweitzerism (I was dubbed a Russian Schweitzer), and other
      such bogeys. I ridiculed all these accusations in my book and
      pointed out that they were either just a matter of squabbling
      about co-optation, or (if they were to be recognised,
      conditionally, as involving “principles”) nothing but
      opportunist, Girondist phrases. The present minority are only
      repeating what Comrade Akimov and other acknowledged
      opportunists said at our Congress against the centralism of all
      the adherents of the old Iskra.
     

      The committees in Russia were outraged at the conversion of the
      Central Organ into the organ of a private circle, an organ of
      co-optation squabbling and Party scandal. A number of
      resolutions expressing the severest censure vere passed. Only
      the so-called St. Petersburg Workers’ Organisation already
      mentioned and the Voronezh Committee (both of them supporters of
      Comrade Akimov’s trend)

    

      pronounced their satisfaction in principle at the trend of
      the new Iskra. Demands to have the Third Party Congress
      summoned became ever more numerous.
     

      The reader who takes the trouble to make a first-hand study of
      the struggle in our Party will readily see that, concretely and
      practically, Comrade Rosa Luxemburg’s talk about
      “ultra-centralism”, about the need for
      centralisation to be gradual, and the like, is a mockery of our
      Congress, while abstractly and theoretically (if one can speak
      here of theory at all) it is nothing but a vulgarisation of
      Marxism, a perversion of true Marxian dialectics, etc.
     

      The latest phase in our Party struggle is marked by the fact
      that the majority members have in part been ousted from the
      Central Committee, in part rendered useless, reduced to
      nonentities. (This happened owing to changes in the Central
      Committee’s

 composition,[7]
      etc.)  The Party Council
      (which after the co-optation of the old editors like wise fell
      into the minority’s hands) and the present Central Committee
      have condemned all agitation for ummoning the Third Congress
      and are taking the path of personal deals and negotiations with
      some members of the minority. Organisations which dared to
      commit such a crime as to agitate for a congress—as for
      instance a certain agent body of the Central
      Committee—have been

 dissolved.[8] A campaign
      against the summoning of the Third Congress has been pro claimed
      by the Party Council and the new Central Committee all along the
      line. The majority have replied with the slogan “Down with
      Bonapartism !" (that is the title of a
      pamphlet by Comrade

 Galyorka,[9]

      who speaks for the
      majority). More and more resolutions are being passed declaring
      that Party institutions which fight against a congress are
      anti-Party and Bonapartist. How hypocritical was all the
      minority’s talk against ultra-centralism and in favour of
      autonomy is obvious from the fact that a new majority publishing
      house started by myself and another comrade (which issued the
      above-named pamphlet by Comrade Galyorka and some others) has
      been declared outside the

 Party.[10]

      This new
      publishing house affords the majority their only opportunity of
      propagating their views, for the columns of Iskra are
      as good as closed to them. Yet—or rather just because of
      it—the Party Council has made the above ruling, on the
      purely

    

      formal grounds that our publishing house has not been authorised by
      any Party organisation.
     

      It need hardly be said how greatly positive work has been neglected,
      how greatly the prestige of Social-Democracy has suffered, how greatly
      the whole Party is demoralised by this nullification of all the
      decisions, all the elections made by the Second Congress, and this
      fight which Party institutions accountable to the Party are waging
      against the convening of the Third Congress.

      Comrade Kautsky has sided with Martov’s formulation, and the
      argument he pleads is expediency. In the first place, at our Party
      Congress this point was not discussed from the standpoint of
      expediency, but of principle. That was the way the question was
      put by
      Axel rod. Secondly, Comrade Kautsky is mistaken if he thinks that
      under

   

      the Russian police regime there is such a big difference between
      belonging to a Party organisation and simply working under its
      control. Thirdly, it is particularly misleading to compare the
      position in Russia today to that in Germany under the Anti-Socialist

      Law.[11]
     —Lenin
 



[5]

      This article, written in reply to Rosa Luxemburg’s article “Organ
      isational Issues in the Russian Social-Democratic Movement”, was sent
      to Kautsky for publication in the German Social Democratic journal Neue
      Zeit, but Kautsky would not print it.

Rabochaya Gazeta (Workers’ Gazette) was an illegal
      paper published
      in 1897 by the Kiev group of Social-Democrats. Two issues

   

      appeared: No. 1 in August and No. 2 in December (dated November). The First
      Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. adopted Rabochaya Gazeta as the official
      organ of the Party, but the paper had to cease publication as a result of a
      police raid on the printing press and the arrest of the Central
      Committee. Concerning attempts to resume publication in 1899, see present
      edition, Vol. 4, pp. 207-09.
     



[11]

      The Anti-Socialist Law in Germany was promulgated in 1878. It
      suppressed all organisations of the Social-Democratic Party, mass
      working-class organisations, and the labour press; socialist literature was
      confiscated, and many Social-Democrats were de ported. The law was annulled
      in 1890 under pressure of the mass
      working-class movement.
     



[7]

      The members elected to the Central Committee at the Second Party Congress
      were Lengnik, Krzhizhanovsky, and Noskov. In October (New Style) 1903,
      Zemlyachka, Krasin, Essen, and Gusarov were co-opted; in November, Lenin and
      Galperin were coopted. In July- September 1904 further changes took place in
      the Central Commit tee’s composition: Lengnik and Essen—supporters of
      Lenin—were arrested; the conciliators Krzhizhanovsky and Gusarov
      resigned; over Lenin’s protests, the conciliators Krasin, Noskov, and Galpe
      rin unlawfully ousted the majority adherent Zemlyachka and co opted three
      conciliators: Lyubimov, Karpov, and Dubrovinoky. As a result of these
      changes, the majority oft he Central Committee now consisted of
      conciliators.

      statements by Party oi anisations and members upholdimog the Second Party
      Congress decisions and demanding the convening of the Third Congress. It
      issued a number of pamphlets directed against the Mensheviks and
      conciliators: Lenin, The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s”

Obliging services are welcome, as we know;

      
      But shun the service of a clumsy friend.


      From such as Struve heaven us defend,


      Obliging Struve’s worse than any

 foe.[1]



      The latest issue (No. 57) of Mr. Struve’s Osvobozhdeniye
      contains the following instructive lines:
     


      “The process of disintegration within the so-called Russian
      Social- Democratic Labour Party has entered a new phase. The
      extreme centralists (’Leninists’, ’firm-liners’, ’Bolshevists’)
      are beginning to lose ground, and the position of their
      opponents is becoming stronger and stronger—at least in
      the ’colonies’ abroad. Whereas the ’Menshevists’ (Martovites)
      are getting the upper hand nearly everywhere and gaining control
      of one party organ after another, the ’Bolshevists’ are losing
      individuals and whole groups, who, while not definitely
      accepting the ’platform’ of the minority, nevertheless do not
      wish to war with the latter and endeavour to establish peace in
      the still discordant party. ’Conciliators’ are appearing on the
      scene who are anxious to put an end to this unseemly wrangling
      in which people have ceased to understand not only each other)
      but even themselves. The appearance of these ’conciliators’ has
      corn polled the irreconcilable centralists to start a
      ’publishing house of Social-Democratic Party literature devoted
      to the defence of the principles of the Second Party Congress
      majority’. (Announcement by V. Bonch-Bruyevsch and N. Lenin.) We
      have before us three products of this new publishing house:
1)
      To the Party, Geneva, 1904, 16 pp., price 20 cent. or
      15 pf.;
2) Galyorka, Down with Bonapartism!, Geneva,
      1904, 23 pp.’ price 25 cent. or 20 pf.;
      3) Galyorka and

 Ryadovoy,[2] Our
Misunderstandings, Geneva, 1904, price 50 cent, or 40
      pf. These three pamphlets are chiefly devoted to a critical
      examination of certain methods—which are indeed not
      altogether above reproach omployOd by the ’Monshevists’ in their
      struggle against the ’majority’, and to advocacy of the thesis that
      the convening of a third congress to settle party conflicts is not
      only feasible, but essential.
     

      “While formally, from the standpoint of party loyalty,
      the position of the ’Bolshevists’ is the sounder one, they yield to
      their opponents in substance. In substance, the latter are
      now defending something more vital and effectual than the
      ’Bolshevists’. Only it is unfortunate

    

      that this defence is being conducted by not altogether proper, or
      rather altogether improper, and sometimes positively indecent,
      means. As examples of such improper methods we may cite countless
      recent articles in Iskra and the newly published pamphlet
      Our Political Tasks (Tactical and Organisational Questions)
      by N. Trotsky, Geneva, 1904, 107 pp., price 75 cent. While marked in
      many places by empty phrase mongering, this pamphlet is however quite
      right in taking up the cudgels for certain ideas with which those
      interested in Social-Democratic literature are already familiar from
      the writings of Messrs. Akimov, Martynov, Krichevsky, and other
      so-called ’Economists’. Only it is a pity that in places the author
      carries their views to the point of caricature.”
     


      How much malicious rejoicing we find here over the troubles of our
      Party! But then, by his very political nature your liberal is bound
      to rejoice at any weakening and demoralisation of Social-Democracy.
     

      How much conscious and heartfelt sympathy for the Akimovite
      substance of the minority’s views! But then, is it not a fact
      that the only hope of vitality, ideological vitality, for Russian
      liberalism lies in the vitality of Social- Democratic opportunism?
     

      The new Iskra has no luck with its supporters.
     

      Recall Plekhanov’s celebrated, stupendous, epoch-making “What
      Should Not Be Done”. How subtly conceived was this policy of
      finesse and personal concessions, and what a sad mess our diplomat
      landed in! How accurately did that consistent opportunist, Mr. Struve,
      perceive the “significant change of front” of the new
      Iskra! The “gulf” between the old and the new
      Iskra is now admitted by the leaders of the latter
      themselves.
     

      Recall Plekhanov’s complacent assertion in Iskra, No. 65,
      that “nobody is afraid of Akimov; you couldn’t use him now even
      to scare the sparrows in a cabbage-patch”. Plekhanov made this
      remark, which was not particularly mild or accommodating towards the
      Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, and he also declared that at our Party
      Congress “nobody spoke against orthodox Marxism except an Akimov
      or so”. And then, right after these complacent assertions, the
      leaflet of the Voronezh Committee—which as everybody knows
      solidly supports Comrades Akimov and Brouck re—was reprinted
      in full; and it turned out that the editors of the new
      Iskra had concealed from the public (in No. 61) the
      whole section

    

      of this leaflet that had to do with principles, and all its
      expressions of sympathy with the new Iskra. Who is it that
      has proved to resemble a sparrow? And what Party institution may now
      be likened to a cabbage-patch?
     

      Recall the author of “High Time!”, the article in th 
      supplement to Nos. 73-74 of Iskra. As a frank and
      honest spokesman of the views advocated throughout our Congress
      by all the “Marsh” delegates, this comrade bluntly
      proclaimed his disagreement with Plekhanov, he bluntly stated
      his opinion that “at the Congress Akimov played the part
      of a spectre of opportunism rather than of a real representative
      of it”. And the poor editors had once more to undergo a
      self- inflicted thrashing. They appended the following note to
      this statement of the author of “High Time
      !":
     


      “We cannot agree with this opinion. Comrade Akimov’s
      programmatic views bear the clear stamp of opportunism, as is
      admitted even
      by an Osvobozhdeniye critic when he says in a recent issue
      that Comrade Akimov belongs to the ’realistic’—read,
      revisionist—trend.”
     


      Very nice, is it not? In the programmatic views of Comrade
      Akimov—with whom, in the disputes over the programme,
      Comrades Martynov, Brouck re, and the Bundists voted almost
      invariably, and the delegates of the Marsh very often—
      there is opportunism. But in his tactical and organisational
      views there is no opportunism—is that your idea, gentle
      men? Why is it that you prefer to say nothing about these latter
      views? Isn’t it because, after loudly announcing its new
      differences over organisational questions, the new
      Iskra has said just what, and only what, Martynov and
      Akimov used to say against the old Iskra? Isn’t it
      because the new tactical differences that the new Iskra
      has lately announced also amount to nothing but a repetition of
      what Martynov and Akimov used to say long ago against the old
      Iskra? How useful it would be to republish today No. 10
      of Rabocheye Dyelo!
     

      And whom do the editors of the new Iskra cite as judge and
      witness against Comrade Akimov? Mr. Struve. And a fine judge he is,
      truly a specialist, connoisseur, champion, and expert in
      opportunism. All the more significant is the testimony of this
      witness, summoned by the editors them selves, on the substance of
      Trotsky’s views. And Trotsky’s

    

      pamphlet, please do not forget, was published under the
      editorship of “Iskra” (No. 72, p. 10,
      col. 3). Trotsky’s “new” views are the views of the
      editorial board, approved by Plekhanov, Axelrod, Zasulich,
      Starover, and Martov.
     

      Empty phrase-mongering and Akimovism, the latter, unfortunately,
      in caricature—such is the verdict of a judge sympathetic
      to the new Iskra and appealed to by that organ itself.
     

      This time the obliging liberal inadvertently blurted out the
      truth.

      In the pamphlet here offered to the reader we have endeavoured to
      give as full as possible a collection of documents showing
      the attitude of various Party organisations working on the spot
      towards the present crisis in our Party. These documents are
      reproduced partly from texts already published in Iskra and
      partly direct from the manuscripts, and the reader should bear in mind
      that owing to the conditions under which these manuscripts were
      delivered mistakes and omissions were sometimes bound to creep in.
     

      The contents of the documents revolve around one central
      point—the fight for the party spirit against the circle
      spirit, the fight for a congress. Originally this was a fight
      for the Second Party Congress, for the recognition and honest
      observance of its decisions; now it is for the Third Congress,
      as the only method worthy of the Party of ending the present
      intolerable situation. We have also tried to show as fully as
      possible, on the basis of documentary evidence, the fight of
      the Party’s present central institutions against a third
      congress.
     

      Our work has been confined to arranging the documents in chronological
      order (as far as possible) and adding the briefest explanations to
      indicate the connection between them. We leave all comment for
      subsequent publications. Tile bare facts regarding the fight for a
      congress speak for themselves, and anybody who studies them will be
      able to form his own judgement of the internal struggle in our Party.

      The crisis in the Party is dragging on interminably and becoming
      ever more difficult to resolve. The adherents of the majority
      have repeatedly stated in the press their views concerning the
      causes of the crisis and the means by which it could be
      ended. The statement of the

     twenty-two,[1]

which was supported by
      a number of committees (the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev,
      Riga, St. Petersburg, and Moscow committees and the Caucasian
      League), by the declaration of the

 nineteen,[3] and
      by the majority members, abroad gave a full and precise
      exposition of the majority’s programme. Everyone at all
      acquainted with the development of the crisis and at all
      concerned for the Party’s honour and dignity has long realised
      that the only way out is a Party congress. But now the new
      declaration by a section of the Central Committee and the new
      decisions of the Party Council aggravate the division in the
      Party still more. The Central Committee members who have
      deserted to the minority have not shrunk from the grossest
      violation of the rights of those members of the Central
      Committee who remain on the side of the majority. In proclaiming
      its reconciliation policy the new Central Committee has not only
      failed to take account of the wishes of the majority, but has
      totally ignored the latter and entered into a compact with the
      minority alone, and moreover by means of private, secret
      transactions. Anyone sincerely desiring a reconciliation would
      first of all bring together all the warring, contending,

    

      and mutually incensed, and that means calling a Party
      congress. To talk of peace and fear a congress, to go about
      peace-making and at the same time hold up the bogey of a split
      because of the minority’s probable defeat at the Third Congress
      also, is to be a hypocrite, to try to force the caprice of an
      6migr6 circle on the Party workers in Russia, to sanctify with
      the specious slogan of peace a complete betrayal of the
      majority. In the name of peace the new Central Committee is
      breaking up organisations which have the audacity to want a
      congress. In the name of peace the new Central Committee
      proclaims the publications of the majority to be non-Party
      publications and refuses to supply them to the committees. In
      the name of peace the new Central Committee is injecting a
      squabbling element into the decisions of the Party Council,
      which dares to talk in print about “deceit” on the
      part of comrades whose actions have not been investigated yet
      and who have not even been presented with the charges made
      against them. The Party Council is now directly falsifying the
      opinion and verdict of the Party membership, by having the
      committee resolutions scrutinised by a Central Committee
      notoriously hostile to a congress, by casting suspicion on these
      resolutions, delaying their publication, gerrymandering the
      number of votes, arrogating to itself the congress prerogative
      of declaring mandates invalid, and disorganising positive work
      by stirring up the local committees’ “peripheral
      organisations” against them. Meanwhile the centrally
      conducted positive work is also at a standstill because the
      Central Committee and Central Organ are engrossed in resisting a
      congress.
     

      No course remains to the majority committees and organisations but to
      unite to fight for a congress, against the so-called central
      institutions of the Party, which in fact are directly flouting the
      Party. We are making a beginning of such unity by forming a Bureau of
      Majority Commit tees, on the initiative and by the common consent of
      the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, Riga, St. Petersburg, and Moscow
      committees.
     

      Our slogan is the fight for the party spirit against the circle
      spirit, the fight for the consistent revolutionary line against
      zigzags, confusion, and a reversion to Rabocheye Dyelo-ism, a

    

      fight in the name of proletarian organisation and discipline against
      the disrupters of organisation.
     

      Our immediate objects are to build up ideological and
      organisational unity of the majority in Russia and abroad, to
      support and promote in every way the publishing house of the
      majority (started abroad by Comrades Bonch-Bruyevich and
      Lenin), to combat the Bonapartism of our central institutions,
      to ensure the correctness of measures for convening the Third
      Congress, and to assist the positive work of the committees,
      which is being disrupted by the agents of the editorial board
      and the new Central Committee.
     
Bureau of Majority Committees 

      In Russia the Bureau can be contacted through the majority
      committees, and abroad through the Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin
      publishing house.

    FOR PARTY MEMBERS ONLY

      The editorial board of Iskra has just issued (“for Party
      members”) a letter addressed to the Party organisations. Russia has
      never been within such close distance of a constitution, say the
      editors; and they expound a complete plan for a “political
      campaign”, a complete plan for influencing our liberal
      Zemstvo-ist petitioners for a constitution.
     

      Before analysing this exceedingly instructive plan of the new
      Iskra’s, let us recall how the Russian Social-Democrats
      have regarded the question of their attitude towards the
      liberal Zemstvo-ists since a mass working-class movement
      arose. Everyone knows that, practically from the inception of
      the mass working-class movement, a struggle went on between the
      “Economists” and the revolutionaries over this
      question too. The former went so far as directly to deny the
      existence of a bourgeois-democratic element in Russia and ignore
      the proletariat’s task of influencing the opposition strata of
      society; at the same time, by narrowing the scope of the
      political struggle of the proletariat, they consciously or
      unconsciously left the role of political leadership to the
      liberal elements of society, assigning to the workers “the
      economic struggle against the employers and the
      government”. The adherents of revolutionary
      Social-Democracy fought in the old Iskra against this
      trend. This struggle may be divided into two main periods: the
      period before the appearance of a liberal
      organ—Osvobozhdeniye—and the period after
      it appeared. During the first period we directed our attack
      mainly against the narrowness of the Economists; we tried to
      “wake them up” to the fact, which they failed to
      perceive, of the existence of a bourgeois-democratic element in
      Russia; we emphasised the need for political activity by the
      proletariat in every sphere, we stressed that the proletariat

    

      must influence all sections of society, that it must become the
      vanguard in the battle for freedom. It is the more fitting and
      necessary to recall this period and its main features now because the
      adherents of the new Iskra grossly falsify it (see Trotsky’s
      Our Political Tasks, published under the editorship of
      Iskra), banking on the unfamiliarity of the younger
      generation with the recent history of our movement.
     

      From the time of the appearance of Osvobozhdeniye, the
      second period in the old Iskra’s fight began. When the
      liberals came out with an organ and political programme of their
      own, the proletariat’s task of influencing “society”
      naturally underwent a modification: working-class democrats
      could no longer confine themselves to “shaking up”
      the liberal democrats and rousing their opposition spirit; they
      had to put the emphasis on revolutionary criticism of the
      half-heartedness so clearly exhibited in the political position
      of liberalism. The influence we brought to bear on the liberal
      strata now took the form of constantly pointing out the
      inconsistency and inadequacy of the liberals’ political protest
      (it is sufficient to mention Zarya, which criticised
      Mr. Struve’s preface to the Witte

     Memorandum,[1]

also numerous articles in Iskra).
     

      By the time of the Second Party Congress this new attitude of
      the Social-Democrats towards the now articulate liberals was
      already so well-defined and established that there was no
      question in anyone’s mind about whether a bourgeois-democratic
      element existed in Russia and whether the opposition movement
      ought to receive support (and what kind of support) from the
      proletariat. The only question was how to formulate the Party’s
      views on the subject; and I need only point out here that the
      views o  the old Iskra were much better expressed in
      Plekhanov’s resolution, which emphasised the
      anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian character of the liberal
      Osvobozhdeniye, than in the con fused resolution tabled
      by Starover, which, on the one hand, aimed (quite inopportunely)
      at an “agreement” with the liberals, and, on the
      other, stipulated for it conditions that were manifestly unreal,
      being altogether impossible for the liberals to fulfil.
     
    

    I

      Now let us examine the new Iskra’s plan. The editors
      acknowledge that we must make full use of all material showing
      the irresolution and half-heartedness of the liberal democrats
      and the antagonism of interests between the liberal bourgeoisie
      and the proletariat, must do so “in accordance with the
      fundamental demands of our programme”. “But," the
      editors continue, “but within the framework of
      the struggle with absolutism, notably in its present phase, our
      attitude towards the liberal bourgeoisie is determined by
      the task of spurring it to greater boldness and inducing it
      to join in the demands which the proletariat, led by the
      Social-Democrats, will put forward [?  has put forward?
      I." We have italicised the particularly strange words in this
      strange tirade. For what is it if not strange to contrast
      criticism of half-heartedness and analysis of antagonistic
      interests, on the one hand, and the task of spurring these
      people to greater boldness and inducing them to join, on the
      other? How can we spur the liberal democrats to greater boldness
      except by relentless analysis and devastating criticism of the
      half-heartedness of their democracy?  Insofar as the bourgeois
      (liberal) democrats intend to act as democrats, and are forced
      to act as democrats, they necessarily seek the support of the
      widest possible sections of the people. This inevitably produces
      the following contradiction. The wider these sections of the
      people, the more representatives are there among them of the
      proletarian and semi-proletarian strata, who demand the complete
      democratisation of the political and social system—such
      complete democratisation as would threaten to undermine very
      important pillars of all bourgeois rule (the monarchy, the
      standing army, the bureaucracy). Bourgeois democrats are by
      their very nature incapable of satisfying these demands, and are
      therefore, by their very nature, doomed to irresolution and
      half-heartedness. By criticising this half-heartedness, the
      Social-Democrats keep prodding the liberals on and winning more
      and more proletarians and semi-proletarians, and partly petty
      bourgeois too, from liberal democracy to working-class
      democracy. How then is it possible to say: we must criticise the
      half-heartedness of the liberal bourgeoisie, b a t
      (but!)  our attitude

    

      towards it is determined by the task of spurring it to greater
      boldness? Why, that is plain muddle-headedness, which shows that its
      authors are either marching backward, reverting to the days when the
      liberals did not come forward openly at all, when they had still to be
      roused, stirred, induced to open their mouths—or else are
      slipping into the idea that one can “spur” the liberals to
      greater boldness by subtracting from the boldness of the proletarians.
     

      Preposterous as this idea is, we find it again, even more
      clearly expressed, in the very next passage of the editors’
      letter: “But”—again that editorial
      reservation—“but we should be making a fatal mistake if we
      tried by strong measures of intimidation to
      force the Zemstvos or other organs of the bourgeois
      opposition to give here and now, under the influence of
      panic, a formal promise to present our demands to the
      government. Such a tactic would discredit the Social- Democrats,
      because it would make our entire political campaign a lever for
      reaction.” (Editors’ italics.)
     

      So that’s how it is, is it? Before the revolutionary proletariat
      has dealt the tsarist autocracy a single serious blow, at
      a time when that autocracy is so visibly shaken and when a
      serious blow is so imperative, would be so useful, and might
      prove decisive, there are Social-Democrats who go about mumbling
      about levers for reaction. This is not just muddle headedness,
      it is sheer inanity. This is what the editors have come to with
      their terrible bogey, invented specially to start this talk
      about becoming a lever for reaction. Just think of it: that
      people should talk in all seriousness, in a letter to the
      Social-Democratic Party organisations, of tactics of
      intimidating the Zemstvo-ists and forcing them to give formal
      promises under the influence of panic! Even among Russian
      officialdom, even among our

 Ugryum-Burcheyevs,[4]
      it would not be easy to find a political
      infant who
      would believe in such a bogey. We have among our revolutionists
      hotheaded terrorists, desperate bomb-throwers; but even the most
      hare-brained of the hare-brained defenders of bomb-throwing
      have yet, I believe, to propose intimidating
      the Zemstvo-ists and striking panic into ... the opposition. Cannot
      the editors see that the inevitable effect of their ridiculous bogeys
      and inane phrases is to perplex and mislead, to befog and confuse the
      minds of the fighting proletarians?

    

      After all, these catchwords about levers for reaction and the
      discrediting tactics of intimidation do not fly into empty space; they
      fall upon the specific soil of police-ridden Russia, so eminently
      suited for the sprouting of weeds. Talk about levers for reaction is
      indeed to be heard at every street corner nowadays, but it comes from
      the Novoye Vremya

 gentry.[5] The story
      about the discrediting tactics of intimidation has indeed been
      repeated ad nauseam—by the cowardly leaders of the
      bourgeois opposition.
     

      Take Prof. Prince E. N. Trubetskoy. A sufficiently
      “enlightened” and—for a legal Russian
      personality—a sufficiently “bold” liberal,
      one would think. Yet how fatuously he discourses in the liberal
      Pravo (No. 39) on the “internal danger”,
      namely, the danger from the extreme parties! There you have a
      live example of who really is close to panic; a graphic instance
      of what really does have an intimidating effect on real
      liberals. What they are afraid of, it need hardly be said, is
      not the plan conjured up by the Iskra editors, the plan
      of extorting from the Zemstvo-ists formal promises to the
      revolutionaries (Mr. Trubetskoy would only roar with laughter if
      told of such a plan); they are afraid of the revolutionary
      socialist aims of the “extreme” parties, they are
      afraid of leaflets, those first harbingers of independent
      revolutionary action by the proletariat, which will not stop,
      will not lay down its arms until it has over thrown the rule of
      the bourgeoisie. This fear is not inspired by ludicrous bogeys,
      but by the actual nature of the working- class movement; and it
      is a fear ineradicable from the hearts of the bourgeoisie (not
      counting a few individuals and groups, of course). And that is
      why the new Iskra’s talk about the discrediting
      tactics of intimidating the Zemstvo-ists and representatives of
      the bourgeois opposition rings so false. Afraid of leaflets,
      afraid of anything that goes beyond a qualified- franchise
      constitution, the liberal gentry will always stand in fear of
      the slogan “a democratic republic” and of the call
      for an armed uprising of the people. But the class- conscious
      proletariat will indignantly reject the very idea that we could
      renounce this slogan and this call, or could in general be
      guided in our activity by the panic and fears of the
      bourgeoisie.
     
 

      Take Novoye Vremya. What dulcet melodies it weaves about the
      lever-for-reaction theme! “The youth and reaction,” we read in
      the “Notes” in No. 10285 (October 18).
      “...The words go ill together, and yet unconsidered actions, impulsive
      ardour, and the desire at all costs to share immediately in shaping
      the nation’s fortunes may bring the youth to this hopeless
      impasse. The demonstration a few days ago in front of the Vyborg
      prison; then the attempt at some sort of demonstration in the heart of
      the capital; in Moscow, the procession of 200 students with banners
      and protests against the war.... All this explains the
      reaction.... Student disturbances, youth demonstrations—why,
      they are a real god send, a trump card, an unexpected ace of trumps in
      the hands of the reactionaries. Truly a welcome present for them,
      which they will know how to make the most of. We should not make them
      these presents, should not go about smashing imaginary [!!!]
      window-bars; the very doors are open now [the doors of the Vyborg and
      other prisons?], wide open!”
     

      This disquisition requires no comment. One has only to quote it
      to see how tactless it is to talk about a lever for reaction
      now—now, when not one door of the all-Russia
      prison has opened a hair’s breath for the struggling workers;
      when the tsarist autocracy has not yet made a single con cession
      that would affect the proletariat in the slightest; when all
      attention and efforts should be centred on preparing for a real
      and decisive battle with the Russian people’s enemy. Of course,
      the very thought of such a battle strikes fear and panic into
      the Trubetskoys and the thousands of less
      “enlightened” liberal gentlemen. But we should be
      fools if we took their panic into consideration. What we should
      take into consideration is the state of our forces, the growth
      of popular ferment and indignation, the moment when the
      proletariat’s direct onslaught on the autocracy will link up
      with one of the spontaneous and spontaneously growing movements.
     
II

      In speaking above of the bogey our editors conjured up, we did not
      mention another characteristic little point in their argument. The
      editors denounce the discrediting tactics of seeking to extort from
      the Zemstvo-ists “a formal

    

      promise to present our demands to the government”. Over
      and above the absurdities already noted, the very idea that
      “our” demands, the demands of working-class
      democrats, should be presented to the government by liberal
      democrats is a peculiar one. On the one hand, the liberal
      democrats, being bourgeois democrats, can never identify
      themselves with “our” demands, can never uphold them
      sincerely, consistently, and resolutely. Even if the liberals
      gave, and gave “voluntarily”, a formal promise to
      present our demands, it is a foregone conclusion that they would
      fail to keep that promise, would betray the proletariat. On the
      other hand, if we should be strong enough to exert-serious
      influence on the bourgeois democrats generally and the Zemstvo
      gentlemen in particular, we should be quite strong enough to
      present our demands to the government ourselves.
     

      The editors’ peculiar idea is no slip of the pen, but an
      inevitable product of their general confused position on this
      issue. Listen to this: “As our focal point and guiding
      thread ... we must take the practical task ... of exerting
      powerful organised pressure upon the bourgeois
      opposition”;
      “the draft of the workers’ statement to the liberal
      opposition organ in question” must “explain why the
      workers are not approaching the government, but an assembly of
      representatives of that opposition”. To put the thing in
      this way is a fundamental mistake. We, the party of the
      proletariat, should, of course, “go to all classes of the
      population”, openly and vigorously championing our
      programme and our immediate demands before the people at large;
      we should seek to present these demands to the Zemstvo gentlemen
      too; but our focal point and guiding thread must be pressure on
      the government, not on the Zemstvo-ists. The editors of
      Iskra have turned this question of the focal point
      completely upside down. The bourgeois opposition is merely
      bourgeois and merely an opposition because it does not itself
      fight, because it has no programme of its own that it
      unconditionally upholds, because it stands between the two
      actual
      combatants (the government and the revolutionary proletariat
      with its handful of intellectual supporters) and hopes to turn
      the outcome of this struggle to its own advantage. Accordingly,
      the more heated the struggle becomes, the nearer the moment of
      the decisive battle, the more must we

    

      focus our attention and bring our pressure to bear on our actual
      enemy, and not on a notoriously conditional,
      problematic, unreliable, half-hearted ally. It would be foolish
      to
      ignore this ally, and absurd to try to intimidate and fright en
      him—all that is so self-evident that it is strange even to
      talk about it. But, I repeat, the focal point and guiding thread
      in our agitation must not be pressure on this ally, but
      preparation for the decisive battle with the enemy. For while it
      has been flirting with the Zemstvos and has granted them some
      paltry concessions, the government has not, in actual fact,
      conceded anything whatever to the people; it may still well
      revert to (or rather continue) its reactionary course, as has
      happened in Russia tens and hundreds of times after a momentary
      flash of liberalism from one autocrat or another. At a moment
      like this, when the government is flirting with the Zemstvos and
      the people are being hood winked and lulled with empty words, we
      must particularly
      beware of the fox’s cunning, must be particularly insistent in
      pointing out that the enemy has yet to be defeated, must call with
      particular vigour for continuing and intensifying the fight against
      the enemy, and not shift the emphasis from “approaching”
      the government to approaching the Zemstvos. None other than the
      notorious cream-skimmers and betrayers of freedom are hard at work
      at this moment to put the Zemstvos in the focus of public and
      popular attention and to inspire confidence in them, when actually
      they do not in the least deserve the confidence of genuine
      democrats. Take Novoye Vremya: in the article we have
      already quoted you will find the following argument: “Anyone
      can see that once all our failings and shortcomings can be boldly
      and candidly discussed and there is freedom for the activity of
      every public personality, it should not be long before we see the
      last of these shortcomings and Russia is able to set foot
      confidently on the path of the progress and improvement she so
      sorely needs. We do not even have to invent the organisation to
      serve as the instrument of this progress: it is already to hand in
      the form of the Zemstvos, which only II! II need to be given the
      freedom to grow; therein lies the earnest of genuinely national, not
      borrowed, progress.” This kind of talk not only “conceals a
      desire for a limited monarchy and a qualified-franchise
      constitution” (as the

    

      editors put it elsewhere in their letter); it directly prepares the
      ground for reducing the whole business to a bestowal of smiles on the
      Zemstvos, without even any limitation of the monarchy.
     

      Making pressure on the Zemstvos instead of on the government
      the focal point leads naturally to the unfortunate idea that
      underlay Starover’s resolution—the idea of trying to find,
      now at once, a basis for some sort of “agreements”
      with the liberals. “As regards the present Zemstvos,” the
      editors say in their letter, “our task reduces itself [!!
      I to presenting to them those political demands of the
      revolutionary proletariat which they must support if they are
      to have any right to speak in the name of the people and count
      on the energetic support of the worker masses.” A fine
      definition of the tasks of the workers’ party, I must say! At
      a. time when an alliance of the moderate Zemstvo-ists and the
      government to fight the revolutionary proletariat is only too
      clearly possible and probable (the editors them selves admit the
      possibility of such an alliance), we are to “reduce”
      our task, not to redoubling our efforts in the struggle against
      the government, but to drawing up casuistic conditions for
      agreements with the liberals on mutual sup port. If I put before
      someone demands which he must undertake to support to have me
      support him, what I am doing is concluding an agreement. And we
      ask all and sundry:

      what has become of the “conditions” for agreements with
      the liberals which were prescribed in Starover’s

 resolution[2]

 (signed
      also by Axelrod and Martov), and which our press has already predicted
      could never be fulfilled? The editors’ letter does not say a word
      about these conditions. The editors advocated the resolution at the
      Congress only to throw

    

      it into the waste-paper basket afterwards. At the very first attempt
      to tackle the matter in practice it became apparent that presenting
      Starover’s “conditions” would only provoke Homeric
      laughter from the Zemstvo liberals.
     

      Let us proceed. Can it in general be acknowledged correct in
principle to set the workers’ party the task of
presenting to the liberal democrats or the Zemstvo-ists
political demands “which they must support if they are
to have any right to speak in the name of the people”? No,
such an approach is wrong in principle and can only obscure
the class consciousness of the proletariat and lead to the
most futile casuistry. To speak in the name of the people is
what speaking as a democrat means. Any democrat (the bourgeois
democrat included) has a right to speak in the name of the
people, but he has this right only insofar as he champions
democracy consistently, resolutely, going all the
way. Consequently, every bourgeois democrat
“has some
right to speak in the name of the people” (for every
bourgeois democrat, so long as he remains a democrat,
champions some democratic demand); but at the same time no
bourgeois democrat has a right to speak in the name of the
people all along the line (for no bourgeois democrat is
capable today of championing democracy resolutely and all the
way). Mr. Struve has a right to speak in the name of the
people insofar as Osvobozhdeniye fights against the
autocracy; but Mr. Struve has no right to speak in the name of
the people insofar as Osvobozhdeniye turns and
twists, stops short at a qualified- franchise constitution,
equates Zemstvo opposition with struggle, and will not commit
itself to a clear and consistent democratic programme. The
German National-Liberals had a right to speak in the name of
the people insofar as they fought for freedom of movement. The
German National- Liberals had no right to speak in the name of
the people insofar as they supported the reactionary policy of
Bismarck.
     

      Therefore, to set the workers’ party the task of presenting to the
      liberal bourgeois demands which they must support in order to have any
      right to speak in the name of the people is an absurd and nonsensical
      proceeding. There is no need for us to invent any special democratic
      demands over and above those contained in our programme. In the name

    

      of that programme we must support every democrat (including the
      bourgeois democrat) insofar as he champions democracy, and must
      relentlessly expose every democrat (including the
      Socialist-Revolutionary) insofar as he deviates from democracy (as,
      for instance, in such questions as the freedom of the peasant to leave
      the commune or to sell his land). As for trying to establish in
      advance the permissible degree of turpitude, so to speak, to determine
      beforehand what deviations from democracy a democrat can permit
      himself and still have some right to speak as a democrat, that is such
      a clever idea that one can’t help wondering whether Comrade Martynov
      or Comrade Dan did not lend our editors a hand in inventing it.
     
III

      After setting forth their guiding political considerations, the
      editors’ letter proceeds to expound the details of their great plan.
     

      The Gubernia Zemstvo Assemblies are petitioning for a
      constitution. In the towns of X, Y, Z, our committeemen plus the
      enlightened workers draw up a plan of political campaign
      “according to Axelrod”. The focal point in their
      agitation is pressure on the bourgeois opposition. An organising
      group is elected. The organising group elects an executive
      committee. The executive committee elects a special
      spokesman. Efforts are made “to bring the masses into
      direct contact with the Zemstvo Assembly, to concentrate the
      demonstration before the actual premises where the Zemstvo
      assemblymen are in session. Some of the demonstrators penetrate
      into the session hail, and at a suitable moment, through the
      spokesman specially authorised for the purpose, they ask the
      permission of the Assembly F?  of the Marshal of the Nobility,
      who presides at the Assembly?] to read out a statement on behalf
      of the workers. If this is not granted, the spokesman enters a
      loud protest against the refusal of an Assembly which speaks in
      the name of the people to hear the voice of the people’s genuine
      representatives”.
     

      Such is the new Iskra’s new plan. We shall see in a moment
      how modest is the editors’ opinion of it; but first let us

    

      quote their highly profound explanations as to the functions of the
      executive committee:
     

      “... The executive committee must take measures in advance
      to ensure that the appearance of several thousand workers
      outside the building where the Zemstvo assemblymen are in
      session, and of several score or hundred in the building itself,
      shall not plunge the Zemstvo-ists into panic fear U!],
      under the impact of which they might throw themselves 1!] under
      the shameful protection of the police and Cossacks, thus
      transforming a peaceful demonstration into an ugly fight and
      brutal battering, distorting its whole meaning....” (The editors
      themselves seem to have been taken in by the bogey of their own
      making. Taking the sentence in its literal, grammatical sense,
      they even seem to be saying that it is the Zemstvo-ists who
      would be transforming the demonstration into a brutal battering
      and distorting its meaning. We have a very low opinion of the
      Zemstvo liberals, but even so the editors’ panic fear that the
      liberals in a Zemstvo Assembly might call in the police and
      Cossacks seems to us quite nonsensical. Anyone who has ever
      attend ed a Zemstvo Assembly will know that, in the event of
      so-called disorder, the police would be sent for either by the
      presiding Marshal of the Nobility or by the police officer
      unofficially present in an adjoining room. Or perhaps the
      members of the executive committee are to explain to this police
      officer that it is no part of the new Iskra’s
      “plan” to have a peaceful demonstration transformed
      into a brutal battering?)
     

      “To obviate such a surprise, the executive committee must
      inform the liberal assemblymen beforehand [so that they may give
      a “formal promise” not to send for the Cossacks?]
      of the forthcoming demonstration and its true purpose Ii.e.,
      inform them that our true purpose does not consist in being
      brutally battered and so having the meaning of Axelrod’s plan
      distorted]. Furthermore, it must try to reach some agreement
      [mark this!] with the representatives of the Left wing of the
      bourgeois opposition and secure, if not their active support, at
      any rate their sympathy with our political action. Its
      negotiations with them must, it need hardly be said, be
      conducted in the name of the Party and on the instructions of
      the workers’ circles and meetings,

    

      which should not only discuss the general plan of the political
      campaign but hear reports of its progress—the rules of secrecy
      being, of course, strictly observed.”
     

      Yes, yes, we can well see that Starover’s great idea of an
      agreement with the liberals on the basis of exactly prescribed
      conditions is gaining strength and substance daily and
      hourly. To be sure, all these exactly prescribed conditions have
      been shelved “for the time being” (we are no
      formalists!); but, on the other hand, an agreement is being
      reached in practice, now, at once, viz., an agreement not to
      cause panic fear.
     

      Whichever way one reads the editors’ letter, no other meaning of
      its famous “agreement” with the liberals can be
      found than that we have indicated: either it is an agreement
      about the conditions on which the liberals would have a right to
      speak in the name of the people (and in that case the very idea
      of it very seriously discredits the Social- Democrats who
      advance it); or else it is an agreement about not causing panic
      fear, an agreement about sympathising with a peaceful
      demonstration—in which case it is just non sense that can
      hardly be discussed seriously. Nor could the absurd idea of the
      paramount importance of pressure on the bourgeois opposition,
      instead of on the government, have resulted in anything but an
      absurdity. If we are in a position to organise an imposing mass
      demonstration of workers in the hall of a Zemstvo Assembly, we
      shall, of course, do so (though if we have forces enough for a
      mass demonstration it would be much better to
      “concentrate” them “before the premises”
      not of the Zemstvo, but of the police, the gendarmerie, or the
      censorship). But to be swayed when doing so by considerations
      like the Zemstvo-ists’ panic fears, and to engage in
      negotiations on that score, would be the height of ineptitude,
      the height of absurdity. Among a good proportion, most likely
      the majority, of Russia’s Zemstvo-ists, the very
      content of a speech by a consistent Social-Democrat
      will always and inevitably arouse panic fear. To parley with the
      Zemstvo-ists beforehand about the undesirability of
      that sort of panic fear would place one in the falsest
      and most undignified kind of position. A brutal battering, or
      the prospect of one, will just as inevitably arouse panic fear
      of another sort. To engage

    

      in negotiations with the Zemstvo-ists concerning this panic fear would
      be very foolish, because not even the most moderate liberal will ever
      bring about such a battering or
      sympathise with it—but the thing does not depend upon him.
      What is needed here is not “negotiations”, but the actual
      mustering of force; not pressure on the Zemstvo-ists, but pressure on
      the government and its agents. If we have no force behind us, better
      not to hold forth about great plans; and if we do have it, then it is
      force we must oppose to the Cossacks and police, we must try to gather
      a crowd of such size and in such a spot that it should be able to
      repel, or at least to check, the onslaught of the Cossacks and
      police. And if we are indeed capable of exerting “powerful
      organised pressure upon the bourgeois opposition”, it is
      assuredly not by silly “negotiations” about not causing
      panic fear, but by force and force alone, the force of mass resistance
      to the Cossacks and the tsarist police, the force of a mass onslaught
      capable of growing into a popular uprising.
     

      The editors of the new Iskra see things differently. They are
      so pleased with their plan for an agreement and negotiations that
      they cannot admire it enough, cannot find praise enough to lavish on
      it.
     

      ...The active demonstrators must be “imbued with an understanding
      of the fundamental difference between an ordinary demonstration
      against the police or the government in general, and a demonstration
      immediately designed to further the struggle against absolutism,
      through direct pressure by the revolutionary proletariat on the
      political tactics [indeed! I of the liberal elements at the
      present [italicised by the editors] moment.... To organise
      demonstrations of the ordinary, so to speak, general-democratic [!! I
      type, not aiming directly at a concrete counterposing of the
      revolutionary proletariat and the liberal bourgeois opposition
      as two
      independent political forces, the mere existence of strong political
      ferment among the masses is sufficient.... Our Party must utilise this
      mood of the masses even for such, so to say, a lower type [note that!]
      of their mobilisation against absolutism.... We are taking our first
      I!] steps on a new [!I path of political activity, the path of
      organising planned intervention by the worker masses

    

      [N. B.] in public life with the direct aim of counterposing them to
      the bourgeois opposition as an independent force, which has opposite
      class interests, but which at the same time offers it conditions
      [what conditions? I for waging a vigorous joint struggle against the
      common enemy.”
     

      It is not given to everyone to appreciate all the profundity of this
      remarkable disquisition. The Rostov

 demonstration,[6]
      where thousands and thousands of workers were made familiar

      with the aims of socialism and the demands of working-class
      democracy, is a “lower type of mobilisation”, the
      ordinary, general-democratic type; here there is no
      concrete counterposing of the revolutionary proletariat and the
      bourgeois opposition. But when a specially authorised spokesman
      appointed by an executive committee, which has been elected by
      an organising group, which has been set up by the committeemen
      and active workers—when that spokesman, after first
      negotiating with the Zemstvo ists, enters a loud protest in the
      Zemstvo Assembly because it declines to hear him—that will
      be a “concrete” and “direct”
      counterposing of two independent forces, that will be
      “direct” pressure on the tactics of the liberals,
      that will be “a first step on a new path”. For
      heaven’s sake, gentlemen! Why, even Martynov in the worst days
      of Rabochege Dyelo hardly sank quite so low as this!
     

      The mass meetings of workers in the streets of the southern
      towns, dozens of worker speakers, direct clashes with the real,
      tangible force of the tsarist autocracy—all that is a
      “lower type of mobilisation”. Agreements with the
      Zemstvo-ists about a peaceful statement by our spokesman who
      will undertake not to cause panic among Messrs. the
      liberals—that is a “new path”. There you have
      the new tactical tasks, the new tactical views of the new
      Iskra, of which the world was informed with such pomp
      by the editorial

 Balalaikin.[7] On one point,
      though, this Balalaikin happened to speak the truth: between the
      old Iskra and the new there is indeed a yawning
      gulf. The old Iskra had only contempt and derision for
      people who could admire, as a “new path”, a
      theatrically staged agreement between classes. This new
      path is one we have long known, from the record of those French
      and German Socialist “statesmen” who similarly
      regard the old revolutionary tactics as a “lower

    

      type” and never weary of praising “planned and
      direct intervention in public life” in the form of
      agreements to allow
      the workers’ spokesmen to make peaceful and modest statements after
      negotiations with the Left wing of the bourgeois opposition.
     

      The editors are in such panic fear of the panic fear of the
      Zemstvo liberals that they insistently enjoin “particular
      caution” on those who take part in their “new”
      plan. “As an extreme case of external caution in the way
      the action is actually carried out,” says the letter, “we
      can envisage mailing the workers’ statement to the assemblymen’s
      homes and scattering a considerable number of copies in
      the Zemstvo Assembly hall. Only people affected with bourgeois
      revolutionism [sic!], for which the external effect is
      everything and the process of the systematic development of the
      class-consciousness and initiative of the proletariat Is
      nothing, could have any objection to this.”
     

      Well, we are not wont to object to the mailing or scattering of
      leaflets, but we shall certainly always object to pompous and
      hollow phrase-mongering. To make the mailing and scattering of
      leaflets the occasion for talking with serious mien about the
      process of the systematic development of the class-consciousness
      and initiative of the proletariat, one must be a veritable
      paragon of complacent banality. To clamour from the housetops
      about new tactical tasks and then reduce the whole thing to the
      mailing and scattering of leaflets is really priceless; and
      nothing could be more characteristic of the exponents of the
      intellectualist trend in our Party, who, now that their new
      words in organisation have proved a fiasco, rush about
      frantically in search of a new word in tactics. And then they
      talk, with their usual modesty, about the vanity of external
      effect! Can’t you see, my good sirs, that at best, even
      supposing your so-called new plan were entirely successful,
      having a workingman address the Zemstvo gentry would only
      achieve an external effect, and that to talk of its really
      exerting “powerful” pressure on “the tactics
      of the liberal elements” is nothing but a joke? Is it not
      rather the other way round—that what has really exerted
      powerful pressure on the tactics of the liberal elements is
      those mass workers’ demonstrations which to you are of the
      “ordinary, general-democratic, lower type”?

    

      And if the Russian proletariat is destined again to exert effective
      pressure on the tactics of the liberals, it will, I assure you, be by
      a mass onslaught against the government, not by an agreement with the
      Zemstvo-ists.
     
IV

      The Zemstvo campaign, launched with the gracious permission of
      the police; the blandishments of Svyatopolk

 Mirsky[8] and the
      government press; the rising tone of the liberal

      press; the animation in what is known as educated
      society—all this faces the workers’ party with very
      serious tasks indeed. But these tasks are quite wrongly
      formulated in the letter of the Iskra editors. At this
      of all times, the political activity of the proletariat must be
      focused on organising powerful pressure on the government, not
      on the liberal opposition. Particularly now, agreements between
      the workers and the Zemstvo-ists about peaceful
      demonstrations—agreements which would inevitably boil down
      to the staging of musical-comedy effects—are utterly out
      of place; what is needed is to rally the advanced,
      revolutionary elements of the proletariat in preparation for a
      decisive struggle for freedom. Particularly now,when our
      constitutional movement is beginning conspicuously to display
      the original sins of all bourgeois liberalism, and notably the
      Russian variety—phrase-mongering, inconsistency of word
      and action, a sheerly philistine disposition to trust the
      government and every adroit politician—talk about the
      undesirability of frightening and panicking the Zemstvo gentry,
      about levers for reaction, etc., etc., is especially out of
      place. Particularly now, it is vital to build up in the
      revolutionary proletariat the firm conviction that the present
      “emancipation movement in society” will necessarily
      and inevitably prove a bubble like all the others before it
      unless the force of the worker masses, capable of and ready for
      an uprising, intervenes.
     

      The political unrest among all sections of the people— that
      essential condition for an uprising and earnest of its success, an
      earnest that the initiative of the proletariat will meet with
      support—is spreading, growing, becoming more intense all the
      time. It would therefore be very poor

    

      judgement if at this moment- anyone were to start shouting again for
      immediate launching of the assault, for forming at once into assault

 battalions,[9]
      etc. The whole course of events goes
      to show that the tsarist government, will very soon find itself in a
      still worse tangle and faced with an even more formidable
      resentment. The game it has started with the Zemstvo
      constitutionalists is bound to get it into a tangle: whether it makes
      some paltry concessions or whether it makes no concessions at all,
      discontent and exasperation will inevitably spread still wider. And it
      is likewise bound to get into a tangle with its shameful and criminal
      Manchurian adventure, which spells a political crisis in either event:
      decisive military defeat, or the pro traction of a war so hopeless for
      Russia.
     

      What the working class must do is to broaden and strengthen its
      organisation and redouble its agitation among the masses, making
      the most of every vacillation of the government, propagating
      the idea of an uprising, demonstrating the necessity for it from
      the example of all those half hearted and foredoomed
      “steps” about which so much fuss is now being
      made. It need hardly be said that the workers’ response to the
      Zemstvo petitions must be to call meetings, scatter leaflets,
      and—where there are forces enough—organise
      demonstrations to present all the Social-Democratic demands,
      regardless of the “panic” of Mr. Trubetskoy and his
      like or of the philistines’ cries about levers for reaction. And
      if one is really to risk talking in advance, and from abroad at
      that, about a possible and desirable higher type of
      mass demonstration (because demonstrations not of a
      mass nature are altogether without significance); if one is
      really to discuss before what particular premises the
      demonstrators’ forces should be concentrated—we would
      point to the
      premises where the business of police persecution of the
      working-class movement is carried on, to the police, gendarmerie,
      censorship headquarters, to the places where political
      “offenders” are confined. The way for the workers to
      give serious support to the Zemstvo petitions is not by
      concluding agreements about the conditions on which the
      Zemstvo-ists would have a right to speak in the name of the
      people, but by striking a blow at the people’s enemies. And
      there need be little doubt that the idea of such a demonstration
      will

    

      meet with the sympathy of the proletariat. The workers nowadays
      hear

      magniloquent 

      phrases and lofty promises on every hand, they
      see a real—infinitesimal but nonetheless real—
      extension of freedom for “society” (a slackening of
      the curb on the Zemstvos, the return of banished Zemstvo-ists,
      an abatement of the ferocity against the liberal press); but
      they see nothing whatever that gives their political
      struggle more freedom. Under pressure of the revolutionary
      onslaught of the proletariat the government has allowed
      the liberals t-o talk a little about freedom! The
      condition of the slaves of capital, downtrodden and deprived of
      rights, now comes home to the proletarians more clearly than
      ever. The workers do not have any regular widespread
      organisations for the relatively free (by Russian standards)
      discussion of political matters; nor halls to hold meetings in;
      nor newspapers of their own; and their exiled and imprisoned
      comrades are not coming back. The workers see now that the
      liberal bourgeois gentry are setting about dividing the
      bearskin, the skin of the bear which the workers have not yet
      killed, but which they, and they alone, -have seriously
      wounded. They see that, at the very start of dividing the skin
      in anticipation, these liberal bourgeois gentry already snap
      and snarl at the “extreme parties”, at the
      “enemies at home”— the relentless enemies of
      bourgeois rule and bourgeois law and order. And the workers will
      rise still more fearlessly, in still greater numbers, to finish
      off the bear, to win by force for themselves what is
      promised as charity to the liberal bourgeois
      gentry—freedom of assembly, freedom of the workers’ press,
      full political freedom for a broad and open struggle for the
      complete victory of socialism.
     


      We are issuing this pamphlet with the superscription “For Party
      Members Only” inasmuch as the Iskra editors’
      “letter” was issued with that superscription. Actually, to
      stage “secrecy precautions” in regard to a plan that is to
      be circulated to dozens of towns, discussed in hundreds of workers’
      circles, and explained in agitation leaflets and appeals is nothing
      short of ridiculous. It is an instance of the bureaucratic
      mystification which Comrade Galyorka, in “On the New
      Road”, has already noted to be a practice

    

      of the editors and the Council. There is just one angle from which one
      might justify concealing the editorial letter from the public in
      general and the liberals in particular: a letter like that is
      altogether too discreditable to our Party....
     


      We are cancelling the superscription restricting the readership of
      this pamphlet, since our so-called Party editonal board has issued a
      reply to it that is supposedly for the Party membership but is in fact
      circulated only to gatherings of the minority and withheld from Party
      members known to belong to the majority.
     

      If Iskra has decided not to consider us Party members (while
      at the same time fearing to say so openly), we can only resign
      ourselves to our sad fate and draw the appropriate conclusions from
      that decision.

      The reader will recall that Starover’s resolution,
      which was passed by the Congress (in spite of Plekhanov’s opinion and
      mine), lays down three conditions for temporary agreements with the
      liberals: 1) the liberals “shall clearly and unambiguously
      declare that in their struggle against the autocratic government they
      will resolutely side with the Social-Democrats”; 2) “they
      shall not include in their programmes any demands running counter to
      the interests of the working class or the democracy generally, or
      obscuring their political consciousness”; 3) “they shall
      make universal, equal, secret, and direct suffrage the slogan of
      their struggle”.
     —Lenin
 



[3]

The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s” Plan is a criticism
      of a letter to the Party organisations issued by the editors of the
      Menshevik Iskra in November 1904. It evoked a reply from the
      editors, in the form of a second letter; both letters bore the
      superscription “For Party Members Only”. The second letter was,
      however, circulated exclusively among Mensheviks, and this caused Lenin to
      add a postscript to his pamphlet (last two paragraphs on p. 518). As the
      pamphlet had already been printed and circulated to the committees, the
      postscript was printed separately and pasted into the copies still on
      hand. The date “December 22, 1904” relates to the post script only.

     

The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s” Plan had a wide
      circulation among the local Party organisations: during house-searches and
      arrests copies were discovered in Smolensk, Batum, Riga, Saratov, Suvalki,
      and elsewhere.
     



[4]

Ugryum-Burcheyev—the type of the stolid, narrow-minded
      dignitary, depicted by Saltykov-Shchedrin in his History of a Town.
      By “our Ugryum-Burcheyevs” Lenin meant the palace clique of
      Nicholas II.
     



[5]

Nova ye
      Vremya (New Times)—a paper published in St. Petersburg
      from 1868 to October 1917. Originally moderately liberal, after 1876 it
      became the organ of the reactionary nobility and bureauc racy, fighting not
      only the revolutionary, but also the liberal-bourgeois movement. Starting
      with 1905 it was one of the mouthpieces of the Black Hundred
      arch-reactionaries.
     



[6]

       The Rostov
      demonstration—the great political demonstration, with 30,000
      workers taking part, which grew out of the strike in Rostov in November
      1902. The strike, which began on November 2 (15) as an economic one, was led
      by the Iskra-ist Don Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. Lenin discussed
      the Rostov strike in his article “New Events and Old Questions”
      (present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 278-83).
     



[7]

Balalaikin—a character in Saltykov-Shchedrin’s “Modern
      Idyll”, a liberal windbag, adventurer, and liar. By the
      “editorial Balalai kin” of the Menshevik Iskra Lenin
      meant Trotsky.
     



[8]

Svyatopolk-Mirsky—Minister of the Interior in the latter half
      of 1904, whose tenure of the post was marked by a brief “liberal

   

      season” of minor concessions by the autocracy to the liberal
      bourgeoisie.
     



[9]

       Lenin is
      referring to the adventurist calls of the Economists (Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ists) in the spring of 1901 for an immediate assault on
      “the fortress of despotism”.

 Outline of My Talk 


{

      1. Already at the Second Congress the minority Iskraists
      displayed instability of principle (or went astray) and in the
      elections found themselves in coalition with their ideological
      opponents.
     

      2. After the Congress too—even at the League—the minority
      championed the continuity of the old Iskra but actually
      shifted further and further away from it.
     

      3. Plekhanov at the time of his swing-over (No. 52) saw clearly that
      the minority constituted the opportunist wing of the Party and were
      fighting like anarchistic individualists.
     

(Contra Vasilyev and Lenin in the matter of circle

       spirit.)[1]



{

      4. Defending, justifying, elevating to a principle our organisational
      backwardness and the organisational nullification of the Congress
      already constitutes opportunism. No one will today venture to
      support, as such, theses on programme versus Rules, etc.
     

      5. To accuse the majority of ignoring the economic struggle, of
      Jacobinism, of ignoring the workers’ independent initiative, is
      nothing but totally groundless repetition of the attacks of
      Rabocheye Dyelo on Iskra.
     

      6. Fear of the Third Congress and opposition to it completes the false
      position of both the minority and the conciliators.
     

      7. In the Zemstvo campaign plan the Iskra editors have
      embarked on a particularly false and harmful, an undoubtedly

    

      opportunist tactical course by bringing up the question of panic
      and extolling agreements with the Zemstvo-ists about peaceful
      demonstrations as being a new type.
     

      The campaign plan is connected with Starover’s mistaken resolution.

      This talk on the situation within the Party was given by Lenin shortly after
      he wrote The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s” Plan—
      at meetings of Russian political bmigrbs in Paris on November 19 (December
      2), in Zurich on November 23 and 24 (December 6 and 7), and in Berne on
      November 25 (December 8), 1904.

Dear Comrades, 

      Today, at a meeting of a close circle of Bolsheviks abroad, a
      final decision was taken on a question that in principle has
      long been decided: the publication of a Party periodical that
      will uphold and develop the principles of the majority against
      the organisational and tactical discord brought into the Party
      by the minority, and will serve the needs of the positive work
      of the organisations in Russia, against whom such a bitter fight
      is now being carried on by minority agents practically all over
      the country—a fight that terribly disorganises the Party
      at this vital historical juncture, and one that is carried on
      throughout by the most shameless splitting methods and tactics,
      amid hypocritical deploring of the split by the so-called
      Central Organ of the Party. We have done everything in our power
      to steer the struggle into a Party channel; ever since January
      we have been fighting for a congress, as the only worthy Party
      way to end this impossible situation. By now it is perfectly
      clear that the activities of the Central Committee following its
      desertion to the minority consist almost entirely in desperately
      resisting a congress, and that the Council is resorting to the
      most outrageous and unpardonable tricks to put off convening
      it. The Council is directly sabotaging a congress; whoever has
      still to be convinced of that after its latest decisions,
      printed in the supplement to Nos. 73-74 of Iskra,
      will see it from Orlovsky’s pamphlet The Council Against the

 Party,[2]
      which we published the other day. It
      is perfectly clear now that unless they unite and resist our
      so-called central institutions, the

    

      majority will not be able to uphold their position, to uphold
      the party spirit in its struggle against the circle
      spirit. Union of the Bolsheviks in Russia has long been put
      forward by them as an urgent need. Recall the tremendous
      sympathetic response to the programmatic resolution of the
      twenty

 two[1]

      (programmatic for our struggle within the Party);
      recall the proclamation of the nineteen, issued in printed form
      by the Moscow Committee (October 1904); lastly, nearly all Party
      committees are aware that a number of private conferences of
      majority committees have lately been held, and in part are still
      being

held,[3] and
that the most vigorous and
      definite efforts are being made to solidly unite the majority
      committees for resistance to the overweening Bonapartists on
      the Council, Central Organ, and Central Committee.
     

      We hope that these efforts (or rather steps) will be made
      generally known in the very near future, when the results will
      allow of a definite statement of what has already been
      achieved. It need hardly be said that the majority would have
      been quite unable to conduct their self-defence without a
      publishing house of their own. As you may already know from our
      Party literature, the new Central Committee simply ejected our
      pamphlets (and even the covers of pamphlets already set up)
      from the Party printing office, thus turning the latter into the
      printing office of a circle, and refused the direct request of
      the majority members abroad and of committees in
      Russia—the Riga Committee, for instance—to have
      majority literature delivered to Russia. It became quite evident
      that falsification of Party opinion was a systematic tactic of
      the new Central Committee. We found ourselves faced unavoidably
      with the necessity of expanding our publishing activities and
      setting up our own transport arrangements. The committees that
      had broken off comradely relations with the editorial board of
      the Central Organ (see Dan’s admission in his account of the
      Geneva meeting of September 2,

 1904[4]—an
      interesting pamphlet) could not and cannot do without a
      periodical organ. A party without an organ, an organ without a
      party! This tragic formulation put forward by the majority as

    

      far back as August inexorably decreed the one solution—the
      starting of our own organ. The young literary forces that have
      been coming abroad to uphold the vital cause of the majority of
      the comrades in Russia need a field for their energies. A number
      of Party writers in Russia likewise call insistently for an
      organ. In starting this organ, which will probably be called
      Vperyod, we are acting in full agreement with the mass
      of the Bolsheviks in Russia, and in full harmony with our
      conduct in the Party struggle. We are resorting to this weapon
      after a whole year spent in trying every, absolutely every way
      that is simpler, more economical for the Party, more perfectly
      in accordance with the interests of the working-class
      movement. We are by no means abandoning the struggle for a
      congress; on the contrary, we want to extend, co-ordinate, and
      support this struggle, want to help the committees to decide the
      new question now facing them—that of arranging a congress
      with— out the Council and Central Committee, and against
      the wishes of the Council and Central Committee—a question
      that requires the fullest and most serious discussion. We openly
      champion views and aims that have long since been stated, in a
      number of pamphlets, before the whole Party. We are fighting and
      will continue to fight for the consistent revolutionary line,
      against discord and

      wabbling 

      in matters of both organisation and
      tactics (see the monstrously muddled letter of the new
      Iskra to the Party organisations, printed for Party
      members only and concealed from the eyes of the

 world[5]). The announcement about the new organ will
      probably appear in a week or so, and the first issue somewhere
      between January 1 and 10, New Style. The editorial board will
      include all the majority writers that have so far come to the
      fore (Ryadovoy, Galyorka, Lenin, Orlovsky, who contributed
      regularly to Iskra from its 46th to 51st issue, when it
      was conducted by Lenin and Plekhanov, and also very valuable
      younger forces). The body practically directing and organising
      the complex business of distribution, agencies, etc., etc.,
      will be formed (has already been formed in

 part)[6] through
      direct assignment of definite functions to
      definite comrades by a number of Russian committees (the Odessa,
      Ekaterinoslav, and Nikolayev committees, the four Caucasian
      committees, and several

    

      northern ones, more particulars of which you will receive
      shortly). We now appeal to all comrades to give us all the
      support they can. We shall conduct the organ on the under
      standing that it is the organ of the movement in Russia, not of
      any 6migr6 circle. This requires, first and foremost, the most
      vigorous “literary” support, or rather
      literary participation, from Russia. I have put the word
      “literary” in italics and inverted commas in order
      to draw attention from the first to its special sense and
      caution against a misconception that is very common and highly
      detrimental to the work. It is a misconception that writers and
      only writers (in the professional sense of the term) can success
      fully contribute to a publication; on the contrary, it will be
      vital and alive only if for five leading and regularly
      contributing writers there are five hundred or five thousand
      contributors who are not writers. One of the shortcomings of the
      old Iskra, one which I always tried to rid it of (and
      which has grown to monstrous proportions in the new
      Iskra) was that too little was done for it from
      Russia. We always used to print everything, practically without
      exception, that we received from Russia. A really live organ
      should print only a tenth of what it receives, using the rest as
      material for the information and guidance of the
      journalists. We must have as many Party workers as possible
      correspond with us, correspond in the ordinary, not the
      journalistic sense of the term.
     

      Isolation from Russia, the engulfing atmosphere of the accursed
      6migr6 slough, weighs so heavily on one here that living contact
      with Russia is our only salvation. Let all re member that who
      want in fact, and not just in word, to consider (and to
      make) our organ the organ of the entire
      “majority”, the organ of the mass of Russian
      comrades. Let everyone who regards this organ as his own and who
      is conscious of the duties of a Social-Democratic Party member
      abandon once and for all the bourgeois habit of thinking and
      acting as is customary towards legally published
      papers—the habit of feeling: it is their business
      to write and ours to read. All Social-Democrats must work for
      the Social-Democratic paper. We ask everyone to contribute, and
      especially the workers. Give the workers the widest opportunity
      to write for our paper, to write about positively everything, to

    

      write as much as they possibly can about their daily lives,
      interests, and work—without such material a
      Social-Democratic organ will not be worth a brass farthing and
      will not
      deserve the name. In addition, please send us private
      letters, not intended as contributions to the paper, i.e.,
      not for publication, but by way of comradely intercourse with
      the editors and to keep them informed, and not only about facts
      and incidents, but about the prevailing sentiment and the
      everyday, “uninteresting”, humdrum, routine side of
      the movement. People who have not lived abroad cannot imagine
      how much we need such letters (there is absolutely nothing
      secret about them either, and to write such an uncoded letter
      once or twice a week is really something the busiest person can
      do). So write to us about the discussions at the workers’ study
      circles, the nature of these discussions, the subjects of study,
      and the things the workers ask about; about the state of
      propaganda and agitational work, and about contacts among the
      general public, in the army, and among the youth; above all
      write about any dissatisfaction the workers feel with us
      Social-Democrats, about the things that trouble them, about
      their suggestions, criticisms, etc. Matters relating to the
      practical organisation of the work are particularly interesting
      now, and there is no way of acquainting the editors with them
      except by a lively correspondence not of a journalistic nature,
      but simply of a comradely kind. Of course, not everyone has the
      ability or inclination to write, but ... don’t say “I
      can’t”, say “I don’t want to”; given the
      desire, one or two comrades who could write can be found in any
      circle, any group, even the smallest, even the most minor (the
      minor groups are often especially interesting, for they
      sometimes do the most important, though inconspicuous, part of
      the work). We here have from the start placed the secretarial
      work on a broad footing, draw ing on the experience of the old
      Iskra; and you for your part should know that
      anybody, absolutely anybody who sets about it with
      patience and determination can without much difficulty make sure
      that all his letters, or nine-tenths of them, reach their
      destination. I say this on the basis of the three years’
      experience of the old Iskra, which had many such an
      informal correspondent (often unacquainted with any of the
      editors) who wrote with the utmost regularity.

    

      The police have long been quite unequal to the task of
      intercepting all foreign correspondence (they only seize a
      letter occasionally, if the writer has been unusually careless);
      and the great bulk of the old Iskra’s material
      always used to arrive in the most usual way, in ordinary letters
      sent to our addresses. A special word of warning against the
      practice of concentrating correspondence only in the hands of
      the committee and the secretaries. Nothing could be more harmful
      than such a monopoly. Essential as unity is in actions and
      decisions, in the matter of general information, of
      correspondence, it is quite wrong. It very often happens that
      the most interesting letters are from comparative
      “outsiders” (people more remote from the
      committees), who perceive more freshly much that old
      experienced workers overlook because they are too used to
      it. Give every opportunity to the younger people to write to
      us—to the youth, to Party workers, to
      “centralists”, to organisers, and to ordinary
      rank-and-filers at impromptu meetings and mass rallies.
     

      Only given such a wide correspondence can we, by our joint efforts,
      make our paper a real organ of the working- class movement in
Russia. We earnestly request, to have this letter read to every
      kind of meeting, study circle, subgroup, etc., etc.—as widely as
      possible—and to be informed how the workers receive this
      appeal. As to the idea of publishing a separate workers’
      (“popular”) organ and a general—guiding—intellectual
      organ, we are very sceptical about it; we should like to see the
      Social-Democratic newspaper the organ of the whole movement, to see
      the workers’ paper and the Social-Democratic paper fused in one. This
      can be achieved only if we have the most active support of the working
      class.
     
With comradely greetings, 
N. Lenin

       The
      Council Against the Party, by Orlovsky (V. V. Vorovsky), was issued
      in Geneva in November 1904 by the Bolshevik Bonch Bruyevich and Lenin
      Publishing House of Social-Democratic Party Literature.
     



[3]

      Three conferences of Bolshevik local committees were held in Sep
      tember-December 1904: 1) the Southern (Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Nikolayev
      committees); 2) the Caucasian (Baku, Batum, Tiflis, and Imeretian-Mingrelian
      committees); and 3) the Northern (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, Riga,
      Northern, and Nizhni-Novgorod committees).

     

      At Lenin’s suggestion, the conferences elected a Bureau of Major ity
      Committees for preparing and convening the Third Party Con gress, consisting
      of Gusev, Zemlyachka, Lyadov, Litvinov, and others. The Bureau, of which
      Lenin became a member, was formally constituted in December 1904.

      The meeting in Geneva on August 20 (September 2), 1904, was called by the
      Mensheviks by way of providing support for the “July
      Declaration” of the Central Committee. Both Mensheviks and Bolsheviks
      were invited. The Bolsheviks refused, however, to take part, and their
      representative withdrew after announcing that the meeting was not competent
      to pass resolutions in the name of both minority and majority. The
      Mensheviks were obliged to admit at this meeting that the Party committees
      in Russia opposed the con ciliation policy of the Central Committee and that
      the great major ity of them had broken off all relations with the Menshevik
      Iskra.

       Lenin is
      referring to the letter to the Party organisations issued by the Menshevik
      Iskra in November 1904, a criticism of which will be found in

      In No. 77 of Iskra, three members of the Central Committee,
      claiming to act on behalf of that body as a whole, summon

 Comrade N[1] to a court
      of arbitration on the charge of
      “making a false statement designed to disrupt the
      Party”. The allegedly false statement in question was made
      “through a member of the Central Committee who took no part in
      drawing up the declaration”, that is, through me. In view of my
      close connection with the affair, and acting on the authority of
      Comrade N, I consider it my right and duty to participate in the
      arbitration proceedings, and I bring the following charges against
      Central Committee members Glebov, Valentin, and Nikitich.
     

      I charge them with unlawful, improper, formally and morally
      impermissible behaviour towards their fellow-members of the Central
      Committee and towards the Party as a whole.
     

      Inasmuch as this improper behaviour is greatly protracting and
      aggravating the Party crisis, and as it moreover directly affects the
      mass of the Party workers, I consider publicity of the proceedings
      absolutely essential in regard to everything that does not affect the
      secrecy of the organisation, and I shall therefore set forth my
      charges in detail.
     

      I. I charge the three Central Committee members, Glebov, Valentin,
and Nikitich, with systematically deceiving the Party.
     

      1) I charge them with having used the powers conferred on them by the
      Second Party Congress to suppress the public opinion of the Party
      as expressed in the agitation for a Third Congress. They had no
      right to suppress this agitation, which is an inalienable right of
      every Party member. In particular, they had no right to dissolve
      the Southern

    

      Bureau for agitating on behalf of a congress. They had neither the
      formal nor the moral right to censure me, a member of the Party
      Council, for having voted in the Council in favour of a congress.
     

      2) I charge them with having concealed from the Party the committee
      resolutions in favour of a congress, and with taking advantage of
      the confidence they enjoy as members of one of the Party’s highest
      institutions to mislead the committees by a deliberately false
      account of the state of affairs in the Party. They have obstructed
      the elucidation of the truth by refusing to meet the Riga
      Committee’s request to have the resolution of the twenty-two
      printed and distributed and to have majority literature delivered
      to Russia, on the pretext that it is not Party literature.
     

      3) I charge them with not having hesitated, in their agitation against
      a congress, even to disrupt the work on the spot by appealing
      against the pro-congress commit tees to their peripheral
      organisations, doing everything to discredit these committees in
      the eyes of the local workers, and thus tending to destroy that
      confidence between the committees and their periphery without which
      all work is impossible.
     

      4) I charge them with having, through the Central Committee delegate
      on the Council, shared in devising the Council rulings as to the
      conditions for summoning the Third Congress—rulings which
      made a congress impossible and thus deprived the Party of the
      opportunity of settling the conflict within it in a normal way.
     

      5) I charge them with having told the committees that they agreed in
      principle with the position of the majority and that any agreement
      with the minority was only possible if the latter gave up its
      secret separate organisation and its demand for co-optation to the
      Central Committee, yet having at the same time, in secret from
the Party and in deliberate defiance of its will, made a deal
      with the minority on the following terms: 1) preservation of the
      autonomy of the minority’s technical enterprises, and 2)
      co-optation to the Central Committee of three of the most
      inveterate minority adherents.
     

      6) I charge them with having taken advantage of their authority as
      members of one of the Party’s highest institutions

    

      to cast aspersions on their political opponents. They have
      behaved dishonourably towards

 Comrade P.[2] in
      resolving last July on an investigation into his
      alleged false statement to the Northern Committee and to
      this day (December 22) not even presenting him with the
      charges made against him, although Glebov has met P. several
      times, and although this same Glebov, in his capacity of member
      of the Party Council, allowed himself to apply the term
      “deceit” in Iskra to the action of this
      comrade, who had no opportunity to defend himself. They told a
      deliberate untruth when they declared that

 Lidin[3] was not
      a representative (Vertrauensmann) of the
      Central Committee. They deceived the Party members, with the
      object of discrediting in their eyes Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich
      and his associates in the Distribution Centre, by publishing a
      statement in Iskra (No. 77) in which only the
      liabilities of the Distribution Centre were shown (and that
      inaccurately)—and this after they had, through their
      representatives, issued Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich a written
      certificate to the effect that he had conducted the business
      properly and that the accounts were in good order.
     

      7) I charge them with having taken advantage of the absence of Comrade
      Vasilyev and Comrade Zverev, the former foreign representatives of
      the Central Committee, to discredit Party institutions (the
      library and archives of the R.S.D.L.P. in Geneva). They published a
      statement in Iskra, signed by a Central Committee
      “representative” unknown to me, in which the history
      and true character of these institutions was absolutely distorted.
     

      II. In addition, I charge the three members of the Central
Committee, Glebov, Valentin, and Nikitich, with a number of morally
and formally impermissible actions towards fellow-members of that
body.
     

      1) They violated every principle of Party organisation and discipline
      by presenting me (through Comrade Glebov) with an ultimatum to
      resign from the Central Committee or cease agitating for a
      congress.
     

      2) They broke the agreement concluded in their name by Central
      Committee member Glebov, when, as a result of the altered
      composition of the Central Committee, it was no longer to their
      advantage to observe this agreement.
     
 

      3) They had no right, at their meeting in July, to declare
      Comrade N as having resigned from the Central Committee without
      hearing either his statement or mine, particularly as these
      three members of the Central Committee were aware of our demand
      (the demand of four Central Committee

 members[4]) to have this
      disputed matter examined at a general meeting of the Central
      Committee. To declare Comrade N no longer a member of the
      Central Committee was also impermissible in itself, for in doing
      so the three Central Committee members took improper advantage
      of a statement which Comrade N had made conditionally (and of
      which not all the comrades had been informed).
     

      4) The three Central Committee members had no right to conceal
      from me the change in their views and intentions. Comrade Glebov
      assured me at the end of May that their views were expressed in
      the declaration they had drawn up in

 March.[5] Thus
      the July declaration, which conflicts

      basically with the March declaration, was adopted in secret from
      me, and Glebov’s statements were a piece of deception.
     

      5) Glebov broke the agreement he had made with me that in the
      report to the Amsterdam

 Congress,[6]
      which was to be
      written by Dan (as delegate from the Central Organ) and himself,
      Glebov (as delegate from the Central Committee), there would be
      no reference to the differences in the Party. The report, which
      was written by Dan alone, proved to be full of veiled
      controversy and permeated through and through with the views of
      the “minority”. Glebov did not protest against Dan’s
      report, and thus indirectly shared in this attempt to deceive
      the international Social-Democratic movement.
     

      6) The three Central Committee members had no right to deny me
      the opportunity to announce and publish my dissenting opinion
      on an important issue of Party life. The July declaration was
      sent to the Central Organ for publication before I had
      been given a chance to express an opinion about it. On August
      24, I sent the Central Organ a protest against this
      declaration. The Central Organ declared that it would print it
      only if so desired by the three Central Committee members who
      had written the declaration. They did not so desire, and thus
      they concealed my protest from the Party.
     
 

      7) They had no right to withhold from me the minutes )f the Council
      and to deprive me, without formally expeling me from the Central
      Committee, of all information about what was happening in the
      Central Committee, about the appointment of new agents in Russia
      and abroad, the negotiations with the “minority”, the
      state of the Party funds, etc., etc.
     

      8) They had no right to co-opt three new comrades (con iliators) to
      the Central Committee without taking the matter to the Council, as
      required by the Party Rules in he absence of unanimity; and there
      was no unanimity, since I had lodged a protest against the
      co-optation.
     

    

    Appendix

      In view of the importance attaching to the position of the Central
      Committee in the conflict within the Party, I deem it necessary to
      publish the following documents.
     

I. Letters from Comrade Glebov to members of the

“collegium”.[7]


      a) September.
     


      “Relations with the Central Organ and the League have not been
      settled yet. I must say that since our declaration they have become
      impudent and their appetites have been growing. Our position here is
      very difficult: control of things abroad is in the hands of the
      League, private sources are in the hands of the Central Organ, and so
      we are up to our ears in debt. In these straits (with a debt of 9,000
      round our necks), I have to think about finding some solution. I have
      therefore asked the minority to let me have an outline of their
      desired reforms.”
     


      b) September 7.
     


      “Last night I had a business meeting, in the presence of S., with
      three spokesmen of the minority: Popov, Blumenfeld, and Martov.”
     


      Of the questions discussed at this meeting, which, in Glebov’s words,
      turned into “a preliminary meeting for the arrangement of
      peace”, let me mention the following:
     

      1) Organisational relations abroad.
     


      “Responsibility for the movement in Russia to be assumed by the
      Central Committee, the Central Organ, and the League. With a view to
      removing mutual friction and creating a greater interest in the work
      and complete confidence, the general direction of affairs to be
      entrusted to a commission of representatives of the Central Committee,
      the
      Central Organ, and the League. The Central Committee to have two votes
      and the right of veto....”
     

 

      2) Transport.
     


      “The Central Organ to come under the Central Committee’s control,
      with a certain amount of autonomy, as follows: There must only be one
      distribution centre abroad, the Central Committee’s. But the Central
      Organ is to keep charge of its own part of the border. Literature
      distribution in Russia to be in the Central Committee’s hands. To
      give it greater autonomy, however, the Central Organ is to have charge
      of the South. Let me explain. The Central Organ has its own transport
      arrangements. It fears that in the event of a change of administration
      it might be deprived of its routes. It therefore requests to be
      guaranteed them by organisational means.”
     


      c) September 7.
     


      “Dan and possibly others here too are furious over yesterday’s
      agreement as to the management of affairs. What a greedy lot! What
      they would like is to set up abroad a committee of representatives of
      the Central Organ, the Central Committee, and the League, which would
      decide everything abroad; each only to have one vote, of course. Not
      bad, eh?”
     


      d) September.
     


      “I want to draw your attention to the desire the Council has
      expressed for replenishment [this refers to replenishment of the
      Central Committee representation on the Council]. Somebody will have
      to he elected in place of Lenin, who will, of course, proclaim it
      unlawful. I would suggest Dan or Deutsch—with the express
      proviso that they are being appointed only for the purpose of
      representation on the Council. There is nobody else we can elect, it
      seems to me.”
     


II. Letter from a Central Committee agent (now officially co-opted
to the Central Committee) to Comrade Glebov:
     

      September 4.
     


      “Over the declaration there’s such a to-do that it’s hard
      to sort things out. The one thing that’s clear is that all the
      committees except the Kharkov, Crimea, Mining Area, and Don are
      majority commit tees. The Don Committee is neutral, I think, but
      I don’t know for certain. Of the ’majority’ committees, the
      Riga, Moscow, St. Peters burg, and Northern have, as I informed
      you before, expressed lack of confidence in the Central
      Committee on account of the declaration. Full confidence in it
      has been expressed by only a very few committees. The rest have
      expressed confidence in it as regards attempts at
      reconciliation—with the proviso that if these should fail
      a special congress is to be called immediately. Of these
      last-named committees, some make it a condition of
      reconciliation that the minority should cease to regard
      themselves as a ’contracting party’ and abandon their demand

    

      for co-optation as a ’contracting party’ (?). That is the
      picture. If the reconciliation doesn’t come off, the Central
      Committee forfeits the confidence of the majority of the
      committees and will, consequently, itself be obliged to agitate
      for a congress in order to surrender its mandate.

      And the committees’ frame of mind makes it quite clear that a
      congress would pass decisions along the lines proposed by the
      twenty-two, viz., to dismiss the editors and hand over the
      editorship to the majority, to reform the party Council,
      etc.

      But, as I have already told you,
      if the reconciliation is to satisfy the committees, the minority
      must accept the declaration and cease to regard themselves as a
      ’contracting party’. If they do that, I think Lenin will lose
      all support in Russia and it will be possible to restore
      peace. Your remark that matters with Martov are straightening
      out ’little by little’ surprised me. The editors’ obstinacy is
      becoming positively exasperating, and in spite of my sympathies
      for them ideologically and otherwise, I am beginning to lose
      confidence in them as political ’leaders’. They now have the
      organisational question cleared up, and if they persist in their
      obstinacy in the absence of support from Russia (the minority
      are powerless here), it will show that they are only fighting
      for posts.”
     


      That was the beginning of the bargain; and here is the finale.
     

      The Central Committee circulated a letter to the commit tees informing
      them that
     


      “The negotiations will be completed very shortly (in a
      couple of weeks at the outside), and meanwhile we can inform you
      that (1) the Central Committee has not co-opted any minority
      members (somebody is circulating a slander to that effect);
      ... (3) the negotiations with the minority are being conducted
      precisely along the lines that Valentin reported to you, namely,
      that if there are to be any concessions, they can only be on the
      part of the minority and must consist in the Central Organ
      abandoning factional controversy and in the minority dissolving
      their secret organisation, renouncing their demand for
      co-optation to the Central Committee, and turning over all their
      enterprises (technical equipment, transport arrangements,
      contacts) to the Central Committee. Only on these conditions can
      peace be restored in the Party. And there is reason to hope that
      that is how it will be. At all events, if the minority should
      now evince a desire to continue their old policy, the Central
      Committee will immediately break off the negotiations and
      proceed to summon a special congress.”
     


      That is how the Central Committee tried to soothe the committees,
      which expressed lack of confidence in it; and here are some
      letters of “prominent” members of the minority.
      The letters were received in the middle of December 1904, Old Style.
     
 


      “At last we have had a meeting with the riffraff. Their
      reply was as follows: they agree to autonomy for our technical
      enterprises; but as regards the agitation commission, they
      object, considering that to be a direct function of the Central
      Committee (direction of agitation), and prefer reform of the
      Central Committee to this plan;

      however, they cannot
      co-opt officially just now, and propose instead the de facto
      (unofficial) co-optation of three members of the minority
      (Popov, Fomin, and Fischer). Naturally, X. and I at once
      agreed, and hence forth the Menshevik opposition is officially
      dissolved.

It is a veritable load off our minds. The
      entire Central Committee is to have a meeting with us in a day
      or two, after which we shall arrange a conference of the
      committees closest to us....
     

“We are, of course, quite certain that we shall gain
control of the Central Committee and direct it along the lines we
want.

      That will be
      all the easier since many of them already admit the correctness of the
      minority’s criticism on points of principle.... In
      all the consistent firm-liner committees
      (Baku, Odessa, Nizhni-Novgorod, and St. Petersburg) the workers are
      demanding the system of office by election. That is a clear symptom
      that the firm-liners are in their death-agony.”
     


      Simultaneously with this another letter was received:
     


      “An agreement has been reached between ’minority’ representatives
      and the Central Committee. The representatives signed an under
      taking. But as there had been no canvass of the ’minority’ first, the
      undertaking, not unnaturally, turned out not altogether satisfactory:
      it expresses ’confidence’ in the Central Committee, instead of in its
      unity policy; it speaks both of absorption in the Party and of
      terminating our separate existence, whereas the latter alone
      would be sufficient. Lastly, the undertaking does not contain the ’credo’ of
      the ’minority’. In view of this, it has been decided to have all the
      ’minority’ organisations pass a resolution containing the ’credo’ and
      the amendments indicated, while of course recognising our
      representatives’ agreement with the Central Committee as valid.”
     

 *     *  * 

      It is very likely that the individuals caught red-handed and exi osed
      by these documents will, with their usual “moral
      sensitivity”, do their best to divert the Party’s attention from
      the contents of the documents to the moral issue of the right to
      publish them. I am certain that the Party will not allow itself to be
      fooled by this sleight-of-hand. I declare that I take upon myself full
      moral responsibility for this exposure, and will give all necessary
      explanations to the court of arbitration that investigates the matter
      as a whole.

      The severe crisis our Party has been experiencing for a year and
      a half, ever since the time of the Second Congress, has led to
      an inevitable and long-foreseen result: to a complete break of
      the central institutions with the Party. We shall not
      recapitulate here the painful history of that crisis and repeat
      facts sufficiently dealt with in the Party press, and in
      particular in numerous resolutions and statements by the
      committees in Russia and conferences of them. It is sufficient
      to state that the last such conference, the Northern, in which
      the St. Petersburg, Riga, Tver, Moscow, Northern, and
      Nizhni-Novgorod committees took part, elected a Bureau which it
      instructed to act as an Organising Committee for the immediate
      convening of the Third Regular Congress of the Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party.
     

      After waiting beyond all time limits set by the committees for
      an answer from the so-called Central Committee, the Bureau has
      come to an understanding with representatives of the three
      Southern (Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Nikolayev) and four
      Caucasian committees. It is now coming forward in the capacity
      of Organising Committee to convene the Third Regular Congress of
      the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, without the consent
      of the central bodies, which are accountable to the Party but
      have shirked their responsibility to it.
     
 

      This is a time of unprecedented political upsurge in Russia, and
      the proletariat is faced with immense historic tasks in the
      struggle against the autocracy. All Social- Democrats working in
      Russia know what tremendous harm the division within our Party
      has done to the work of organising and rallying the forces of
      the proletariat; what infinite damage the work of propaganda,
      agitation, and achievement of workers’ unity in Russia has
      suffered through the pernicious influence of the migr6 circle
      spirit. And if it is not possible to unite the 6migr6 circles
      and their placemen, let there be unity at least among all
      Social-Democratic Party workers in Russia, all who uphold the
      consistent line of revolutionary Social-Democracy. Their
      unification is the only true road to complete and lasting unity
      in future among all Russian Social-Democrats.
     

      Long live Russian, long live international revolutionary
      Social-Democracy!
     


      Concerning the arrangements for convening the Congress, the Organising
      Committee considers it necessary to make the following announcement:
     

      1) The Organising Committee recognises the unqualified right
      to representation at the Third Regular Congress, with voice and vote,
      of all Russian committees and organisations endorsed by the Second
      Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (the
      St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kharkov, Kiev, Odessa, Nikolayev, Don,
      Ekaterinoslav, Saratov, Ural, Northern, Tula, Tver, Nizhni-Novgorod,
      Baku, Batum, Tiflis, Mining Area, Siberian, and Crimean committees).
     

      2) The Organising Committee recognises the conditional right to
      representation at the Congress of committees endorsed by the
      Central Committee after the Second Congress (the Mingrelian,
      Astrakhan, Orel-I3ryansk, Samara, Smo lensk, Riga, Kursk, and
      Voronezh committees, and also the League Abroad). All these
      committees were endorsed by central bodies which have forfeited the
      confidence of the Party. We are in duty bound to invite them to the
      Third Congress, but only the Congress itself can make the final
      decision as to their participation (actual status of the
      committee, its right to voice only or to voice and vote, etc.).
     
 

      3) On behalf of the majority of the Russian
      committees, the Organising Committee expresses the wish that
      all organisations of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
      Party, both abroad and in Russia, and particularly all workers’
      organisations that consider themselves part of it, should be
      represented at its Third Regular Congress. The participation of the
      last-named appears to us especially desirable because the Party crisis
      and the demagogic preaching of office by election and of democracy
      a‘ la Rabocheye Dyelo have already caused several splits. We
      must take advantage of the Congress to try, with the participation of
      representatives from most of the Russian committees, to heal these
      splits or lessen the harm from them.
     

      4) The Organising Committee accordingly invites all wishing to
      participate in the Congress to respond immediately and communicate
      with it (through one of the thirteen committees named above).
     

      5) The question of invitation to the Congress shall in
      disputed cases be decided by the two nearest committees and a third
      person representing the Organising Committee.
     

      6) The terms of representation at the Congress (with voice
      only or with voice and vote) for committees and other organisations
      not endorsed by the Second Party Congress shall be determined by
      the Third Congress itself.
     

      7) The time and place of the Congress will be fixed by the Organising
      Committee.

[1]

      The A nnouncement of the Formation of an Organising Committee and the
      Convening of the Third Regular Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic
      Labour Party was written by Lenin in December 1904 and sent at that
