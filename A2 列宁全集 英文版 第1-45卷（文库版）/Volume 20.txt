[1]

The article “Critical Remarks on the National Question” was
written by Lenin in October-December 1913 and published the same year in
the Bolshevik legal journal Prosveshcheniye Nos. 10, 11 and 12.


The article was preceded by lectures on the national question which
Lenin delivered in a number of Swiss cities—Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne and
Berne—in the summer of 1913.  

In the autumn of 1913 Lenin made a report on the national question at
the “August” (“Summer”) Conference of the Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. with Party workers. A resolution on the report drafted by Lenin
was adopted. After the Conference Lenin started work on his article
“Critical Remarks on the National Question”.

## Language Question









Lenin: 1913/crnq: 1. LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS ON THE LANGUAGE QUESTION







V. I.  

      Lenin
Critical Remarks on the National Question



    

 

It is obvious that the national question has now become
prominent among the problems of Russian public life. The aggressive
nationalism of the reactionaries, the transition of counter-revolutionary
bourgeois liberalism to nationalism (particularly Great-Russian, but also
Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian, etc.), and lastly, the increase of nationalist
vacillations among the different “national” (i. e., non-Great-Russian)
Social-Democrats, who have gone to the length of violating the Party
Programme—all these make it incumbent on us to give more attention to the
national question than we have done so far.  

This article pursues a special object, namely, to examine, in their
general bearing, precisely these programme vacillations of Marxists and
would-be Marxists, on the national question. In Severnaya
Pravda[2] No. 29 (for September 5, 1913, “Liberals and Democrats on
the Language
      Question”[1]

)

I had occasion to speak of the opportunism of the liberals on the national
question; this article of mine was attacked by the opportunist Jewish
newspaper
Zeit,[3] in an article by Mr. F. Liebman. From the other side,
the programme of the Russian Marxists on the national question has been
criticised by the Ukrainian opportunist Mr. Lev Yurkevich
(Dzvin,[4] 1913, Nos. 7–8). Both these writers touched upon so
many questions that to reply to them we are obliged to deal with the most
diverse aspects of the subject. I think the most convenient thing would be
to start with a reprint of the article from Severnaya Pravda.

    

1. LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS ON THE LANGUAGE QUESTION

On several occasions the newspapers have mentioned the report of the
Governor of the Caucasus, a report that is noteworthy, not for its
Black-Hundred[5] spirit, but for its timid “liberalism”. Among other
things, the Governor objects to artificial Russification of non-Russian
nationalities. Representatives of non-Russian nationalities in the Caucasus
are themselves striving to teach their children Russian; an
example of this is the Armenian church schools, in which the teaching of
Russian is not obligatory.  

Russkoye
Slovo[6] (No. 198), one of the most widely circulating liberal
newspapers in Russia, points to this fact and draws the correct conclusion
that the hostility towards the Russian language in Russia “stems
exclusively from” the “artificial” (it should have said “forced”)
implanting of that language.  

“There is no reason to worry about the fate of the Russian
language. It will itself win recognition throughout Russia,” says the
newspaper. This is perfectly true, because the requirements of economic
exchange will always compel the nationalities living in one state (as long
as they wish to live together) to study the language of the majority. The
more democratic the political system in Russia becomes, the more
powerfully, rapidly and extensively capitalism will develop, the more
urgently Will the requirements of economic exchange impel various
nationalities to study the language most convenient for general commercial
relations.  

The liberal newspaper, however, hastens to slap itself in the face and
demonstrate its liberal inconsistency.  


   “Even those who oppose Russification,” it says, “would
   hardly be likely to deny that in a country as huge as Russia there must be
   one single official language, and that this language can be only Russian.”
   


Logic turned inside out! Tiny Switzerland has not lost anything, but
has gained from having not one single official language, but
three—German, French and Italian. In Switzerland 70 per cent of the
population are Germans (in Russia 43 per cent are Great Russians), 22
per cent French (in Russia 17 per cent are Ukrainians) and 7 per cent
Italians (in Russia 6 per cent are Poles and 4.5 per cent Byelorussians).

    

If Italians in Switzerland often speak French in their common parliament
they do not do so because they are menaced by some savage police law (there
are none such in Switzerland), but because the civilised citizens of a
democratic state themselves prefer a language that is understood by a
majority. The French language does not instil hatred in Italians because it
is the language of a free civilised nation, a language that is not imposed
by disgusting police measures.  

Why should “huge” Russia, a much more varied and terribly backward
country, inhibit her development by the retention of any kind of
privilege for any one language? Should not the, contrary he true, liberal
gentlemen? Should not Russia, if she wants to overtake Europe, put an end
to every kind of privilege as quickly as possible, as completely as
possible and as vigorously as possible?  

If all privileges disappear, if the imposition of any one language
ceases, all Slays will easily and rapidly learn to understand each other
and will not be frightened by the “horrible” thought that speeches in
different languages will be heard in the common parliament. The
requirements of economic exchange will themselves decide which
language of the given country it is to the advantage of the
majority to know in the interests of commercial relations. This decision
will be all the firmer because it is adopted voluntarily by a population of
various nationalities, and its adoption will be the more rapid and
extensive the more consistent the democracy and, as a consequence of it,
the more rapid the development of capitalism.  

The liberals approach the language question in the same way as they
approach all political questions—like hypocritical hucksters, holding out
one hand (openly)to democracy and the other (behind their backs) to the
feudalists and police. We are against privileges, shout the liberals, and
under cover they haggle with the feudalists for first one, then another,
privilege.  

Such is the nature of all liberal-bourgeois nationalism—not
only Great-Russian (it is the worst of them all because of its violent
character and its kinship with the
Purishkeviches[7]), but Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian, Georgian and every
other nationalism. Under the slogan of “national culture”

    

the bourgeoisie of all nations, both in Austria and in Russia, are
in fact pursuing the policy of splitting the workers, emasculating
democracy and haggling with the feudalists over the sale of the people’s
rights and the people’s liberty.  

The slogan of working-class democracy is not “national culture” but
the international culture of democracy and the world-wide working-class
movement. Let the bourgeoisie deceive the people with various “positive”
national programmes. The class-conscious worker will answer the
bourgeoisie—there is only one solution to the national problem (insofar
as it can, in general, be solved in the capitalist world, the world of
profit, squabbling and exploitation), and that solution is consistent
democracy.  

The proof—Switzerland in Western Europe, a country with an old
culture and Finland in Eastern Europe, a country with a young culture.


The national programme of working-class democracy is: absolutely no
privileges for any one nation or any one language; the solution of the
problem of the political self-determination of nations, that is, their
separation as states by completely free, democratic methods; the
promulgation of a law for the whole state by virtue of which any measure
(rural, urban or communal, etc., etc.)  introducing any privilege of any
kind for one of the nations and militating against the equality of nations
or the rights of a national minority, shall be declared illegal and
ineffective, and any citizen of the state shall have the right to demand
that such a measure be annulled as unconstitutional, and that those who
attempt to put it into effect be punished.  

Working-class democracy contraposes to the nationalist wrangling of the
various bourgeois parties over questions of language, etc., the demand for
the unconditional unity and complete amalgamation of workers of
all nationalities in all working-class
organisations—trade union, co-operative, consumers’, educational and all
others—in contradistinction to any kind of bourgeois nationalism. Only
this type of unity and amalgamation can uphold democracy and defend the
interests of the workers against capital—which is already international
and is becoming more so—and promote the development of mankind towards a
new way of life that is alien to all privileges and all exploitation.

[2]
Severnaya Pravda (Northern Truth)—one of the names
of the newspaper Pravda.


Pravda—a legal Bolshevik daily published in
St. Petersburg. Founded on the initiative of the St. Petersburg workers in
April 1912.  

Pravda was a popular working-class newspaper, published with
money collected by the workers themselves. A wide circle of
worker-correspondents and worker-publicists formed around the
newspaper. Over eleven thousand correspondence items from workers were
published in a single year. Pravda had an average circulation of
40,000, with some issues running into 60,000 copies.  

Lenin directed Pravda from abroad, where he was living. He
wrote for the paper almost daily, gave instructions to the editorial board
and rallied the Party’s best literary forces around the newspaper.  

Pravda was subjected to constant police persecution. During
the first year of its existence it was confiscated forty-one times, and
thirty-six legal actions were brought against its editors, who served
prison sentences totalling forty-seven and a half months. In the course of
two years and three months Pravda was closed down eight times by
the tsarist government, but reissued under new names: =

Rabochaya Pravda, Severnaya Pravda, Pravda
Truda, Za Pravdu, Proletarskaya Pravda, Put
Pravdy, Rabochy, and Trudovaya Pravda. =

On July 8 (21), 1914, on the eve of the First World War, the paper was
closed down.  

Publication was not resumed until after the February
Revolution. Beginning from March 5(18), 1917, Pravda appeared as
the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. Lenin joined the editorial board on
April 5(18), on his return from abroad, and took over the

   

paper’s management. In July–October 1917 Pravda changed its name
frequently owing to persecution by the Provisional Government, appearing
successively as Listok Pravdy, Proletary,
Rabochy, and Rabochy Put. On October 27 (November 9) the
newspaper began to appear under its old name—Pravda.





[3]
Zeit (Time)—a weekly,organ of the Bund, published
in Yiddish in St. Petersburg from December 20, 1912 (January 2, 1913) to
May 5(18), 1914.





[4]
Dzvin (The Bell)—a monthly legal nationalist
journal of Menshevik trend, published in the Ukrainian language in Kiev
from January 1913 to the middle of 1914.





[5]
The Black Hundreds—monarchist gangs formed by the tsarist
police to fight the revolutionary movement. They murdered revolutionaries,
assaulted progressive intellectuals and organised pogroms.





[6]
Russkoye Slovo (Russian Word)—a daily, published in
Moscow from 1895 (the first trial issue appeared in 1894) to
July 1918. Formally non-party, the paper defended the interests of the
Russian bourgeoisie from a moderate-liberal platform. News was given a wide
coverage in the paper, which was the first in Russia to send special
correspondents to all the large cities at home and to many foreign
capitals.





[7]
Purishkevich, V. M.—(1870-1920)—a big landlord and rabid
reactionary (a Black-Hundred monarchist).

## National
      Culture









Lenin: 1913/crnq: 2. 'NATIONAL CULTURE'







V. I.  

      Lenin
Critical Remarks on the National Question



    

2. “NATIONAL CULTURE”

As the reader will see, the article in Severnaya Pravda, made
use of a particular example, i. e., the problem of the official language,
to illustrate the inconsistency and opportunism of the liberal bourgeoisie,
which, in the national question, extends a hand to the feudalists and the
police. Everybody will understand that, apart from the problem of an
official language, the liberal bourgeoisie behaves just as treacherously,
hypocritically and stupidly (even from the standpoint of the interests of
liberalism) in a number of other related issues.  

The conclusion to be drawn from this? It is that all
liberal-bourgeois nationalism sows the greatest corruption among the
workers and does immense harm to the cause of freedom and the proletarian
class struggle. This bourgeois (and bourgeois-feudalist) tendency is all
the more dangerous for its being concealed behind the slogan of
“national culture”. It is under the guise of national
culture—Great-Russian, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian, and so forth—that the
Black-Hundreds and the clericals, and also the bourgeoisie of all
nations, are doing their dirty and reactionary work.  

Such are the facts of the national life of today, if viewed from the
Marxist angle, i. e., from the standpoint of the class struggle, and if the
slogans are compared with the interests and policies of classes, and not
with meaningless “general principles”, declamations and phrases.  

The slogan of national culture is a bourgeois (and often also a
Black-Hundred, and clerical) fraud. Our slogan is:
the international culture of democracy and of the world working-class
movement.  

Here the
Bundist[1] Mr. Liebman rushes into the fray and annihilates me with the
following deadly tirade: 


   “Anyone in the least familiar with the national question
   knows that international culture is not non-national culture (culture
   without a national form); non-national culture, which must not be Russian,
   Jewish, or Polish, but only pure culture, is nonsense; international ideas
   can appeal to the working class only when they are adapted to the language
   spoken by the worker, and to the concrete national conditions under which
   he lives; the worker should not be indifferent to the condition and
   development of his national culture, because

    

   it is through it, and only through it, that he is able to participate in
   the ‘international culture of democracy and of the world working-class
   movement’. This is well known, but V. I. turns a deaf ear to it all....”
   


Ponder over this typically Bundist argument, designed, if you please,
to demolish the Marxist thesis that I advanced. With the air of supreme
self-confidence of one who is “familiar with the national question”, this
Bundist passes off ordinary bourgeois views as “well-known” axioms.  

It is true, my dear Bundist, that international culture is not non
national. Nobody said that it was. Nobody has proclaimed a “pure”
culture, either Polish, Jewish, or Russian, etc., and your jumble of empty
words is simply an attempt to distract the reader’s attention and to
obscure the issue with tinkling words.  

The elements of democratic and socialist culture are present,
if only in rudimentary form, in every national culture, since in
every nation there are toiling and exploited masses, whose
conditions of life inevitably give rise to the ideology of democracy and
socialism. But every nation also possesses a bourgeois culture
(and most nations a reactionary and clerical culture as well) in the form,
not merely of “elements”, but of the dominant
culture. Therefore, the general “national culture” is the culture of the
landlords, the clergy and the bourgeoisie. This fundamental and, for a
Marxist, elementary truth, was kept in the background by the Bundist, who
“drowned” it in his jumble of words, i. e., instead of revealing
and clarifying the class gulf to the reader, he in fact obscured it. In
fact, the Bundist acted like a bourgeois, whose every interest
requires the spreading of a belief in a non-class national culture.  

In advancing the slogan of “the international culture of democracy and
of the world working-class movement”, we take from each national
culture only its democratic and socialist elements; we take them
only and absolutely in opposition to the bourgeois
culture and the bourgeois nationalism of each nation. No democrat,
and certainly no Marxist, denies that all languages should have equal
status, or that it is necessary to polemise with one’s “native”
bourgeoisie in one’s native language and to advocate anti-clerical or
anti-bourgeois ideas among one’s “native” peasantry and

    

petty bourgeoisie. That goes without saying, but the Bundist uses these
indisputable truths to obscure the point in dispute, i. e., the real issue.


The question is whether it is permissible for a Marxist, directly or
indirectly, to advance the slogan of national culture, or whether he should
oppose it by advocating, in all languages, the slogan of workers’
internationalism while “adapting” himself to all local and
national features.  

The significance of the “national culture” slogan is not determined
by some petty intellectual’s promise, or good intention, to “interpret”
it as “meaning the development through it of an international
culture”. It would be puerile subjectivism to look at it in that way. The
significance of the slogan of national culture is determined by the
objective alignment of all classes in a given country, and in all countries
of the world. The national culture of the bourgeoisie is a fact
(and, I repeat, the bourgeoisie everywhere enters into deals with the
landed proprietors and the clergy). Aggressive bourgeois nationalism, which
drugs the minds of the workers, stultifies and disunites them in order that
the bourgeoisie may lead them by the halter—such is the fundamental fact
of the times.  

Those who seek to serve the proletariat must unite the workers of all
nations, and unswervingly fight bourgeois nationalism, domestic
and foreign. The place of those who advocate the slogan of national culture
is among the nationalist petty bourgeois, not among the Marxists.  

Take a concrete example. Can a Great-Russian Marxist accept the slogan
of national, Great-Russian, culture? No, he cannot. Anyone who does that
should stand in the ranks of the nationalists, not of the Marxists. Our
task is to fight the dominant, Black-Hundred and bourgeois national culture
of the Great Russians, and to develop, exclusively in the internationalist
spirit and in the closest alliance with the Workers of other countries, the
rudiments also existing in the history of our democratic and working-class
movement. Fight your own Great-Russian landlords and bourgeoisie, fight
their “culture” in the name of internationalism, and, in so fighting,
“adapt” yourself to the special features of the Purishkeviches and
Struves—that is your

    

task, not preaching or tolerating the Slogan of national culture.  

The same applies to the most oppressed and persecuted nation—the
Jews. Jewish national culture is the slogan of the rabbis and the
bourgeoisie, the slogan of our enemies. But there are other elements in
Jewish culture and in Jewish history as a whole. Of the ten and a half
million Jews in the world, somewhat over a half live in Galicia and Russia,
backward and semi-barbarous countries, where the Jews are forcibly
kept in the status of a caste. The other half lives in the civilised world,
and there the Jews do not live as a segregated caste. There the great
world-progressive features of Jewish culture stand clearly revealed: its
internationalism, its identification with the advanced movements of the
epoch (the percentage of Jews in the democratic and proletarian movements
is everywhere higher than the percentage of Jews among the population).


Whoever, directly or indirectly, puts forward the slogan of Jewish
“national culture” is (whatever his good intentions may be) an enemy of
the proletariat, a supporter of all that is outmoded and connected
with caste among the Jewish people; he is an accomplice of the
rabbis and the bourgeoisie. On the other hand, those Jewish Marxists who
mingle with the Russian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian and other workers in
international Marxist organisations, and make their contribution (both in
Russian and in Yiddish) towards creating the international culture of the
working-class movement—those Jews, despite the separatism of the Bund,
uphold the best traditions of Jewry by fighting the slogan of “national
culture”.  

Bourgeois nationalism and proletarian internationalism—these are the
two irreconcilably hostile slogans that correspond to the two great class
camps throughout the capitalist world, and express the two policies (nay,
the two world outlooks) in the national question. In advocating the slogan
of national culture and building up on it an entire plan and practical
programme of what they call “cultural-national autonomy”, the Bundists
are in effect instruments of bourgeois nationalism among the
workers.  
    

     

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Bund (The General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania,
Poland, and Russia) came into being in 1897 at the Inaugural Congress of
Jewish Social-Democratic groups in Vilna. It consisted mainly of
semi-proletarian Jewish artisans of Western Russia. At the First Congress
of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1898 the Bund joined the latter “as an autonomous
organisation, independent only in respect of questions affecting the Jewish
proletariat specifically”. (The C.P.S.U. in Resolutions, and Decisions
of Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central
Committee, Russ. ed., Part I, 1954, p. 14.)  

The Bund was a vehicle of nationalist and separatist ideas in Russia’s
working-class movement. In April 1901 the Bund’s Fourth Congress resolved
to alter the organisational ties with the R.S.D.L.P. as established by the
latter’s First Congress. In its resolution, the Bund Congress declared that
it regarded the R.S.D.L.P. as a federation of national organisations, of
which the Bund was a federal member.  

Following the rejection by the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. of the
Bund’s demand for recognition as the sole representative of the Jewish
proletariat, the Bund left the Party, but rejoined it in 1906 on the basis
of a decision of the Fourth (Unity) Congress.  


Within the R.S.D.L.P. the Bund constantly supported the Party’s
opportunist wing (the Economists, Mensheviks, and liquidators), and waged a
struggle against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism. To the Bolsheviks’
programmatic demand for the right of nations to self-determination the Bund
contraposed the demand for autonomy of national culture. During the years
of the Stolypin reaction and the new revolutionary upsurge, the Bund
adopted a liquidationist stand and played an active p art in the formation
of the August anti-Party bloc. During the First World War (1914–18) the
Bundists took a social-chauvinist stand. In 1917 the Bund supported the
bourgeois Provisional Government and sided with the enemies of the Great
October Socialist Revolution. During the foreign military intervention and
the Civil War, the Bundist leaders made common cause with the forces of
counter-revolution. At the same time a tendency towards co-operation with
the Soviets became apparent among the Bund rank and file. In March 1921 the
Bund dissolved itself, part of the membership joining the Russian Communist
Party (Bolsheviks) in accordance with the general rules of admission.

V. I.  

      Lenin
Critical Remarks on the National Question



    

3. THE NATIONALIST BOGEY OF “ASSIMILATION”

The question of assimilation, i. e., of the shedding of national
features, and absorption by another nation, strikingly illustrates the
consequences of the nationalist vacillations of the Bundists and their
fellow-thinkers.  

Mr. Liebman, who faithfully conveys and repeats the stock arguments, or
rather, tricks, of the Bundists, has qualified as “the old
assimilation story” the demand for the unity and amalgamation of the
workers of all nationalities in a given country in united workers’
organisations (see the concluding part of the article in Severnaya
Pravda).  

“Consequently,” says Mr. F. Liebman, commenting on the concluding
part of the article in Severnaya Pravda, “if asked what
nationality he belongs to, the worker must answer: I am a
Social-Democrat.”  

Our Bundist considers this the acme of wit. As a matter of fact, lie
gives himself away completely by such witticisms and outcries
about “assimilation”, levelled against a consistently democratic
and Marxist slogan.  

Developing capitalism knows two historical tendencies in the national
question. The first is the awakening of national life and national
movements, the struggle against all national oppression, and the creation
of national states. The second is the development and growing frequency of
international intercourse in every form, the break-down of national
barriers, the creation of the international unity of capital, of economic
life in general, of politics, science, etc.  

Both tendencies are a universal law of capitalism. The former
predominates in the beginning of its development, the latter characterises
a mature capitalism that is moving towards its transformation into
socialist society. The Marxists’ national programme takes both tendencies
into account, and advocates, firstly, the equality of nations and languages
and the impermissibility of all privileges in this respect (and
also the right of nations to self-determination with which we shall deal
separately later); secondly, the principle of internationalism and
uncompromising struggle against contamination of the proletariat with
bourgeois nationalism, even of the most refined kind.  
 

The question arises: what does our Bundist mean when he cries out to
heaven against “assimilation”? He could not have meant the
oppression of nations, or the privileges enjoyed by a particular
nation, because the word “assimilation” here does not fit at all, because
all Marxists, individually, and as an official, united whole, have quite
definitely and unambiguously condemned the slightest violence against and
oppression and inequality of nations, and finally because this general
Marxist idea, which the Bundist has attacked, is expressed in the
Severnaya Pravda article in the most emphatic manner.  

No, evasion is impossible here. In condemning “assimilation”
Mr. Liebman had in mind, not violence, not inequality,
and not privileges. Is there anything real left in the concept of
assimilation, after all violence and all inequality have been eliminated?


Yes, there undoubtedly is. What is left is capitalism’s
world-historical tendency, to break down national barriers, obliterate
national distinctions, and to assimilate nations—a tendency
which manifests itself more and more powerfully with every passing decade,
and is one of the greatest driving forces transforming capitalism into
socialism.  

Whoever does not recognise and champion the equality of nations and
languages, and does not fight against all national oppression or
inequality, is not a Marxist; he is not even a democrat. That is beyond
doubt. But it is also beyond doubt that the pseudo-Marxist who heaps abuse
upon a Marxist of another nation for being an “assimilator” is simply a
nationalist philistine. In this unhandsome category of people are
all the Bundists and (as we shall shortly see) Ukrainian
nationalist-socialists such as L. Yurkevich, Dontsov and Co.  

To show concretely how reactionary the views held by these nationalist
philistines are, we shall cite facts of three kinds.  

It is the Jewish nationalists in Russia in general, and the Bundists
in particular, who vociferate most about Russian orthodox Marxists being
“assimilators”. And yet, as the afore-mentioned figures show, out of the
ten and a half million Jews all over the world, about half that
number live in the civilised world, where conditions favouring

    

“assimilation” are strongest, whereas the unhappy, down trodden,
disfranchised Jews in Russia and Galicia, who are crushed under the heel of
the Purishkeviches (Russian and Polish), live where conditions for
“assimilation” least prevail, where there is most segregation,
and even a “Pale of Settlement”,[1] a numerus
clausus[2] and other charming features of the Purishkevich regime.


The Jews in the civilised world are not a nation, they have in the main
become assimilated, say Karl Kautsky and Otto Bauer. The Jews in Galicia
and in Russia are not a nation; unfortunately (through no fault of
their own but through that of the Purishkeviches), they are still a
caste here. Such is the incontrovertible judgement of people who
are undoubtedly familiar with the history of Jewry and take the above-cited
facts into consideration.  

What do these facts prove? It is that only Jewish reactionary
philistines, who want to turn hack the wheel of history, and make it
proceed, not from the conditions prevailing in Russia and Galicia to those
prevailing in Paris and New York, but in the reverse direction—only they
can clamour against “assimilation”. 

The best Jews, those who are celebrated in world history, and have
given the world foremost leaders of democracy and socialism, have never
clamoured against assimilation. It is only those who contemplate the “rear
aspect” of Jewry with reverential awe that clamour against assimilation.


A rough idea of the scale which the general process of assimilation of
nations is assuming under the present conditions of advanced capitalism may
be obtained, for example, from the immigration statistics of the United
States of America. During the decade between 1891-1900, Europe sent
3,700,000 people there, and during the nine years between 1901 and 1909,
7,200,000. The 1900 census in the United States recorded over 10,000,000
foreigners. New York State, in which, according to the same census, there
were over 78,000 Austrians, 136,000 Englishmen, 20,000 Frenchmen, 480,000
Germans, 37,000 Hungarians, 425,000 Irish, 182,000 Italians, 70,000 Poles,
166,000 people from Russia (mostly Jews), 43,000 Swedes, etc., grinds down
national distinctions. And what is taking place on a grand,

    

international scale in New York is also to be seen in every big
city and industrial township.  

No one unobsessed by nationalist prejudices can fail to perceive that
this process of assimilation of nations by capitalism means the greatest
historical progress, the break down of hidebound national conservatism in
the various backwoods, especially in backward countries like Russia.  

Take Russia and the attitude of Great Russians towards the
Ukrainians. Naturally, every democrat, not to mention Marxists, will
strongly oppose the incredible humiliation of Ukrainians, and demand
complete equality for them. But it would be a downright betrayal of
socialism and a silly policy even from the standpoint of the
bourgeois “national aims” of the Ukrainians to weaken the ties
and the alliance between the Ukrainian and Great-Russian proletariat that
now exist within the confines of a single state.  

Mr. Lev Yurkevich, who calls himself a “Marxist” (poor Marx!), is an
example of that silly policy. In 1906, Sokolovsky (Basok) and Lukashevich
(Tuchapsky) asserted, Mr. Yurkevich writes, that the Ukrainian proletariat
had be come completely Russified and needed no separate
organisation. Without quoting a single fact bearing on the direct
issue, Mr. Yurkevich falls upon both for saying this and cries out
hysterically—quite in the spirit of the basest, most stupid and most
reactionary nationalism—that this is “national passivity”, “national
renunciation”, that these men have “split [!!] the Ukrainian Marxists”,
and so forth. Today, despite the “growth of Ukrainian national
consciousness among the workers”, the minority of the workers are
“nationally conscious”, while the majority, Mr. Yurkevich assures us,
“are still under the influence of Russian culture”. And it is our duty,
this nationalist philistine exclaims, “not to follow the masses, but to
lead them, to explain to them their national aims (natsionalna
sprava)” (Dzvin, p. 89).

This argument of Mr. Yurkevich’s is wholly bourgeois-nationalistic. But
even from the point of view of the bourgeois nationalists, some of whom
stand for complete equality and autonomy for the Ukraine, while others
stand for an independent Ukrainian state, this argument will not wash. The
Ukrainians’ striving for liberation is opposed by the

    

Great-Russian and Polish landlord class and by the bourgeoisie of these two
nations. What social force is capable of standing up to these classes? The
first decade of the twentieth century provided an actual reply to this
question: that force is none other than the working class, which rallies
the democratic peasantry behind it. By striving to divide, and thereby
weaken, the genuinely democratic force, whose victory would make national
oppression impossible, Mr. Yurkevich is betraying, riot only the interests
of democracy in general, but also the interests of his own country, the
Ukraine. Given united action by the Great-Russian and Ukrainian
proletarians, a free Ukraine is possible; without such unity, it
is out of the question.  

But Marxists do not confine themselves to the bourgeois-national
standpoint. For several decades a well-defined process of accelerated
economic development has been going on in the South, i. e., the Ukraine,
attracting hundreds of thousands of peasants and workers from Great Russia
to the capitalist farms, mines, and cities. The “assimilation”—within
these limits—of the Great-Russian and Ukrainian proletariat is an
indisputable fact. And this fact is undoubtedly
progressive. Capitalism is replacing the ignorant, conservative, settled
muzhik of the Great-Russian or Ukrainian backwoods with a mobile
proletarian whose conditions of life break down specifically national
narrow-mindedness, both Great-Russian and Ukrainian. Even if we assume
that, in time, there will be a state frontier between Great Russia and the
Ukraine, the historically progressive nature of the “assimilation” of the
Great-Russian and Ukrainian workers will be as undoubted as the progressive
nature of the grinding down of nations in America. The freer the Ukraine
and Great Russia become, the more extensive and more rapid will be
the development of capitalism, which will still more powerfully attract the
workers, the working masses of all nations from all regions of the
state and from all the neighbouring states (should Russia become a
neighbouring state in relation to the Ukraine) to the cities, the mines,
and the factories.  

Mr. Lev Yurkevich acts like a real bourgeois, and a short-sighted,
narrow-minded, obtuse bourgeois at that, i. e., like a philistine, when he
dismisses the benefits to be

    

gained from the intercourse, amalgamation and assimilation of the
proletariat of the two nations, for the sake of the momentary
success of the Ukrainian national cause (sprava). The national
cause comes first and the proletarian cause second, the bourgeois
nationalists say, with the Yurkeviches, Dontsovs and similar would-be
Marxists repeating it after them. The proletarian cause must come first, we
say, because it not only protects the lasting and fundamental interests of
labour and of humanity, but also those of democracy; and without democracy
neither an autonomous nor an independent Ukraine is conceivable.  

Another point to be noted in Mr. Yurkevich’s argument, which is so
extraordinarily rich in nationalist gems, is this: the minority of
Ukrainian workers are nationally conscious, he says; “the majority are
still under the influence of Russian culture” (bilshist perebuvaye
shche pid vplyvom rosiiskoi kultury).  

Contraposing Ukrainian culture as a whole to Great-Russian culture as a
whole, when speaking of the proletariat, is a gross betrayal of the
proletariat’s interests for the benefit of bourgeois nationalism.  

There are two nations in every modern nation—we say to all
nationalist-socialists. There are two national cultures in every national
culture. There is the Great-Russian culture of the Purishkeviches, Guchkovs
and Struves—but there is also the Great-Russian culture typified in the
names of Chernyshevsky and Plekhanov. There are the same two
cultures in the Ukraine as there are in Germany, in France, in England,
among the Jews, and so forth. If the majority of the Ukrainian workers are
under the influence of Great-Russian culture, we also know definitely that
the ideas of Great-Russian democracy and Social-Democracy operate parallel
with the Great-Russian clerical and bourgeois culture. In fighting the
latter kind of “culture”, the Ukrainian Marxist will always
bring the former into focus, and say to his workers: “We must snatch at,
make use of, and develop to the utmost every opportunity for intercourse
with the Great-Russian class-conscious workers, with their literature and
with their range of ideas; the fundamental interests of both the
Ukrainian and the Great-Russian working-class movements demand it.”  
 

If a Ukrainian Marxist allows himself to he swayed by his quite
legitimate and natural hatred of the Great-Russian oppressors to
such a degree that he transfers even a particle of this hatred,
even if it be only estrangement, to the proletarian
culture and proletarian cause of the Great-Russian workers, then such a
Marxist will get bogged down in bourgeois nationalism. Similarly, the
Great-Russian Marxist will be bogged down, not only in bourgeois, but also
in Black-Hundred nationalism, if he loses sight, even for a moment, of the
demand for complete equality for the Ukrainians, or of their right
to form an independent state.  

The Great-Russian and Ukrainian workers must work together, and, as
long as they live in a single state, act in the closest organisational
unity and concert, towards a common or international culture of the
proletarian movement, displaying absolute tolerance in the question of the
language in which propaganda is conducted, and in the purely local or
purely national details of that propaganda. This is the imperative
demand of Marxism. All advocacy of the segregation of the workers of one
nation from those of another, all attacks upon Marxist “assimilation”, or
attempts, where the proletariat is concerned, to contrapose one national
culture as a whole to another allegedly integral national culture, and so
forth, is bourgeois nationalism, against which it is essential to
wage a ruthless struggle.

## Cultural-National
      Autonomy









Lenin: 1913/crnq: 4. 'CULTURAL-NATIONAL AUTONOMY'







V. I.  

      Lenin
Critical Remarks on the National Question



    

4. “CULTURAL-NATIONAL AUTONOMY”

The question of the “national culture” slogan is of enormous
importance to Marxists, not only because it determines the ideological
content of all our propaganda and agitation on the national question, as
distinct from bourgeois propaganda, but also because the entire programme
of the much-discussed cultural-national autonomy is based on this slogan.


The main and fundamental flaw in this programme is that it aims at
introducing the most refined, most absolute and most extreme
nationalism. The gist of this programme is that every citizen registers as
belonging to a particular nation, and every nation constitutes a legal
entity with the right to impose compulsory taxation on its members,

    

with national parliaments (Diets) and national secretaries of state
(ministers).  

Such an idea, applied to the national question, resembles Proudhon’s
idea, as applied to capitalism. Not abolishing capitalism and its
basis—commodity production—but purging that basis of abuses,
of excrescences, and so forth; not abolishing exchange and exchange value,
but, on the contrary, making it “constitutional”, universal, absolute,
“fair”, and free of fluctuations, crises and abuses—such was
Proudhon’s idea.  

Just as Proudhon was petty-bourgeois, and his theory converted exchange
and commodity production into an absolute category and exalted them as the
acme of perfection, so is the theory and programme of “cultural-national
autonomy” petty bourgeois, for it converts bourgeois nationalism into an
absolute category, exalts it as the acme of perfection, and purges it of
violence, injustice, etc.  

Marxism cannot be reconciled with nationalism, be it even of the “most
just”, “purest”, most refined and civilised brand. In place of all forms
of nationalism Marxism advances internationalism, the amalgamation of all
nations in the higher unity, a unity that is growing before our eyes with
every mile of railway line that is built, with every international trust,
and every workers’ association that is formed (an association that is
international in its economic activities as well as in its ideas and aims).


The principle of nationality is historically inevitable in bourgeois
society and, taking this society into due account, the Marxist fully
recognises the historical legitimacy of national movements. But to prevent
this recognition from becoming an apologia of nationalism, it must be
strictly limited to what is progressive in such movements, in order that
this recognition may not lead to bourgeois ideology obscuring proletarian
consciousness.  

The awakening of the masses from feudal lethargy, and their struggle
against all national oppression, for the sovereignty of the people, of the
nation, are progressive. Hence, it is the Marxist’s bounden duty
to stand for the most resolute and consistent democratism on all aspects of
the national question. This task is largely a negative one. But this is the
limit the proletariat can go to in supporting nationalism,

    

for beyond that begins the “positive” activity of the
bourgeoisie striving to fortify nationalism.  

To throw off the feudal yoke, all national oppression, and all
privileges enjoyed by any particular nation or language, is the imperative
duty of the proletariat as a democratic force, and is certainly in the
interests of the proletarian class struggle, which is obscured and retarded
by bickering on the national question. But to go beyond these
strictly limit ed and definite historical limits in helping bourgeois
nationalism means betraying the proletariat and siding with the
bourgeoisie. There is a border-line here, which is often very slight and
which the Bundists and Ukrainian nationalist-socialists completely lose
sight of.  

Combat all national oppression? Yes, of course! Fight for any
kind of national development, for “national culture” in
general?—Of course not. The economic development of capitalist society
presents us with examples of immature national movements all over the
world, examples of the formation of big nations out of a number of small
ones, or to the detriment of some of the small ones, and also examples of
the assimilation of nations. The development of nationality in general is
the principle of bourgeois nationalism; hence the exclusiveness of
bourgeois nationalism, hence the endless national bickering. The
proletariat, however, far from undertaking to uphold the national
development of every nation, on the contrary, warns the masses against such
illusions, stands for the fullest freedom of capitalist intercourse and
welcomes every kind of assimilation of nations, except that which is
founded on force or privilege.  

Consolidating nationalism within a certain “justly” delimited sphere,
“constitutionalising” nationalism, and securing the separation of all
nations from one another by means of a special state institution—such is
the ideological foundation and content of cultural-national autonomy. This
idea is thoroughly bourgeois and thoroughly false. The proletariat cannot
support any consecration of nationalism; on the contrary, it supports
everything that helps to obliterate national distinctions and remove
national barriers; it supports everything that makes the ties between
nationalities closer and closer, or tends to merge nations. To

    

act differently means siding with reactionary nationalist philistinism.


When, at their Congress in
Br\"unn[2] (in 1899), the Austrian Social-Democrats discussed the plan
for cultural-national autonomy, practically no attention was paid to a
theoretical appraisal of that plan. It is, however, note worthy that the
following two arguments were levelled against this programme:
(1) it would tend to strengthen clericalism;
(2) “its result would be the perpetuation of chauvinism, its introduction
into every small community, into every small group” (p. 92 of the official
report of the Br\"unn Congress, in German. A Russian translation was
published by the Jewish nationalist party, the
J.S.L.P.[3]).  

There can be no doubt that “national culture”, in the ordinary sense
of the term, i. e., schools, etc., is at present under the predominant
influence of the clergy and the bourgeois chauvinists in all countries in
the world. When the Bundists, in advocating “cultural-national” autonomy,
say that the constituting of nations will keep the class struggle within
them clean of all extraneous considerations, then that is manifest
and ridiculous sophistry. It is primarily in the economic and political
sphere that a serious class struggle is waged in any capitalist society. To
separate the sphere of education from this is, firstly, absurdly
utopian, because schools (like “national culture” in general) cannot be
separated from economics and politics; secondly, it is the economic and
political life of a capitalist country that necessitates at every
step the smashing of the absurd and outmoded national barriers and
prejudices, whereas separation of the school system and the like, would
only perpetuate, intensify and strengthen “pure” clericalism and “pure”
bourgeois chauvinism.  

On the boards of joint-stock companies we find capitalists of different
nations sitting together in complete harmony. At the factories workers of
different nations work side by side. In any really serious and profound
political issue sides are taken according to classes, not nations. With
drawing school education and the like from state control and placing it
under the control of the nations is in effect an attempt to
separate from economics, which unites the nations, the most
highly, so to speak, ideological sphere of social

    

life, the sphere in which “pure” national culture or the national
cultivation of clericalism and chauvinism has the freest play.  

In practice, the plan for “extra-territorial” or “cultural
national” autonomy could mean only one thing: the division of
educational affairs according to nationality, i.e., the introduction
of national curias in school affairs. Sufficient thought to the
real significance of the famous Bund plan will enable one to
realise how utterly reactionary it is even from the standpoint of
democracy, let alone from that of the proletarian class struggle for
socialism.  

A single instance and a single scheme for the “nationalisation” of
the school system will make this point abundantly clear. In the United
States of America the division of the States into Northern and Southern
holds to this day in all departments of life; the former possess the
greatest traditions of freedom and of struggle against the slave-owners;
the latter possess the greatest traditions of slave ownership, survivals of
persecution of the Negroes, who are economically oppressed and culturally
backward (44 per cent of Negroes are illiterate, and 6 per cent of whites),
and so forth. In the Northern States Negro children attend the same schools
as white children do. In the South there are separate “national”, or
racial, whichever you please, schools for Negro children. I think that this
is the sole instance of actual “nationalisation” of schools.  

In Eastern Europe there exists a country where things like the Beilis
case[4] are still possible, and Jews are condemned by the Purishkeviches
to a condition worse than that of the Negroes. In that country a scheme for
nationalising Jewish schools was recently mooted in the
Ministry. Happily, this reactionary utopia is no more likely to be realised
than the utopia of the Austrian petty bourgeoisie, who have despaired of
achieving consistent democracy or of putting an end to national bickering,
and have invented for the nations school-education compartments to
keep them from bickering over the distribution of schools ... but
have “constituted” themselves for an eternal bickering of one
“national culture” with another.  

In Austria, the idea of cultural-national autonomy has remained largely
a flight of literary fancy, which the Austrian

    

Social-Democrats themselves have not taken seriously. In Russia, however,
it has been incorporated in the programmes of all the Jewish bourgeois
parties, and of several petty-bourgeois, opportunist elements in the
different nations—for example, the Bundists, the liquidators in the
Caucasus, and the conference of Russian national parties of the
Left-Narodnik trend. (This conference, we Will mention parenthetically,
took place in 1907, its decision being adopted with abstention on
the part of the Russian
Socialist-Revolutionaries[5] and the
P.S.P.,[6] the Polish social-patriots. Abstention from voting is a
method surprisingly characteristic of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
P.S.P., when they want to show their attitude towards a most important
question of principle in the sphere of the national programme!)  

In Austria it was Otto Bauer, the principal theoretician of
“cultural-national autonomy”, who devoted a special chapter of his book
to prove that such a programme cannot possibly be proposed for the Jews. In
Russia, however, it is precisely among the Jews that all the bourgeois
parties—and the Bund which echoes them—have adopted this
      programme.[1]

What does this go to show? It goes to show that history, through the
political practice of another state, has exposed the absurdity of Bauer’s
invention, in exactly the same way as the Russian Bernsteinians (Struve,
Tugan-Baranovsky, Berdayev and Co.), through their rapid evolution

    

from Marxism to liberalism, have exposed the real ideological content of
the German
Bernsteinism.[7] 

Neither the Austrian nor the Russian Social-Democrats have incorporated
“cultural-national” autonomy in their programme. However, the Jewish
bourgeois parties in a most backward country, and a number of
petty-bourgeois, so-called socialist groups have adopted it in
order to spread ideas of bourgeois nationalism among the working class in a
refined form. This fact speaks for itself.  


Since we have bad to touch upon the Austrian programme on the national
question, we must reassert a truth which is often distorted by the
Bundists. At the Br\"unn Congress a pure programme of
“cultural-national autonomy” was presented. This was the
programme of the South-Slav Social Democrats, § 2 of which reads:
“Every nation living in Austria, irrespective of the territory occupied by
its members, constitutes an autonomous group which manages all its national
(language and cultural) affairs quite independently.” This programme was
supported, not only by Kristan but by the influential Ellenbogen. But it
was withdrawn; not a single vote was cast for it. A territorialist
programme was adopted, i. e., one that did not create any national
groups “irrespective of the territory occupied by the members of the
nation”.  

Clause 3 of the adopted programme reads: “The self governing
regions of one and the same nation shall jointly form a nationally
united association, which shall manage its national affairs on an
absolutely autonomous basis” (cf. Prosveshcheniye, 1913, No. 4,
p. 28[8]). Clearly, this compromise programme is wrong too. An example
will illustrate this. The German colonists’ community in Saratov Gubernia,
plus the German working-class suburb of Riga or Lodz, plus the German
housing estate near St. Petersburg, etc., would constitute a “nationally
united association” of Germans in Russia. Obviously the Social-Democrats
cannot demand such a thing or enforce such an
association, although of course they do not in the least deny
freedom of every kind of association, including associations of
any communities of any nationality in a given state. The

    

segregation, by a law of the state, of Germans, etc., in different
localities and of different classes in Russia into a single German-national
association may be practised by anybody—priests, bourgeois or
philistines, but not by Social-Democrats.  
 

Notes
 

[1]
That the Bundists often vehemently deny that all the Jewish
bourgeois parties have accepted “cultural-national autonomy” is
understandable. This fact only too glaringly exposes the actual role being
played by the Bund. When Mr. Manin, a Bundist, tried, in
Luch[9] to repeat his denial, he was fully exposed by N. Skop
(see Prosveshcheniye
No. 3[10]). But when Mr. Lev Yurkevich, in Dzvin (1913,
Nos. 7–8, p. 92), quotes from Prosveshcheniye (No. 3, p. 78)
N. Sk’s statement that “the Bundists together with all the Jewish
bourgeois parties and groups have long been advocating cultural-national
autonomy” and distorts this statement by dropping the
word “Bundists”, and substituting the words “national rights”
for the words “cultural national autonomy”, one can only raise one’s
hands in amazement! Mr. Lev Yurkevich is not only a nationalist, not only
an astonishing ignoramus in matters concerning the history of the
Social-Democrats and their programme, but a downright falsifier of
quotations for the benefit of the Bund. The affairs of the Bund and
the Yurkeviches must be in a bad way indeed!  —Lenin
 



[2]
This refers to the Congress of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party
held in Br\"unn (Austria) from September 24 to 29, 1899 (new style). The
national question was the chief item on the agenda. Two resolutions
expressing different points of view were submitted to the Congress: =

(1) the resolution of the Party’s Central Committee supporting the idea of
the territorial autonomy of nations, and =

(2) the resolution of the Committee of the South-Slav Social-Democratic
Party supporting the idea of extra-territorial cultural-national autonomy.


The Congress unanimously rejected the programme of cultural-national
autonomy, and adopted a compromise resolution recognising national autonomy
within the boundaries of the Austrian state. (See Lenin’s article “A
Contribution to the History of the National Program me in Austria and in
Russia”, pp. 36 of this volume.)





[3]
J.S.L.P. (Jewish Socialist Labour Party)—a petty-bourgeois
nationalist organisation, founded in 1906. Its programme was based on the
demand for national autonomy for the Jews—the creation of
extra-territorial Jewish parliaments authorised to settle questions
concerning the political organisation of Jews in Russia. The J.S.L.P. stood
close to the Socialist-Revolutionaries, with whom it waged a struggle
against the R.S.D.L.P.





[4]
The Beilis case—a provocative trial engineered by the
tsarist government in 1913 in Kiev. Beilis, a Jew, was falsely accused of
having murdered a Christian boy named Yushchinsky for ritual purposes
(actually, the murder was organised by the Black Hundreds). The aim of this
frame-up was to fan anti-Semitism and incite pogroms so as to divert the
masses from the mounting revolutionary movement. The trial excited great
public feeling. Workers’ protest demonstrations were held in a number of
cities.  Beilis was acquitted.





[5]
Socialist-Revolutionaries—a petty-bourgeois party in Russia,
which came into being at the end of 1901 and beginning of 4902 as a result
of a merger of various Narodnik groups and circles. The S.R.s saw no class
distinctions between the proletarian and the petty proprietor, played down
the class differentiation and antagonisms within the peasantry, and refused
to recognise the proletariat’s leading role in the revolution. Their views
were an eclectic mixture of the ideas of Narodism and revisionism. In
Lenin’s words, they tried, to mend “the rents in the Narodnik Ideas with
bits of fashionable opportunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism.” (See present
edition, Vol. 9, p. 310.)  

The Socialist-Revolutionaries’ agrarian programme envisaged the
abolition of private ownership of the land, which was to be transferred to
the village commune on the basis of the “labour principle” and
“equalised land tenure” and also the development of co-operatives. This
programme, which the S.R.s called “socialisation of the land”, had
nothing socialist about it. In his analysis of this programme, Lenin showed
that the preservation of commodity production and private farming on
communal land would not do away with the domination of capital or free the
toiling peasantry from exploitation and impoverishment. Neither could the
co-operatives be a remedy for the small farmers under capitalism, as they
served only to enrich the rural bourgeoisie. At the same time, as Lenin
pointed out, the demand for equalised land tenure, though not socialistic,
was of a progressive, revolutionary-democratic character, inasmuch as it
was directed against reactionary landlordism.  

The Bolshevik Party exposed the attempts of the S.R.s to pass
themselves off as socialists. It waged a stubborn fight against them for
influence over the peasantry, and revealed the damage their tactic of
individual terrorism was causing the working-class movement. At the same
time, the Bolsheviks, on definite terms, entered into temporary agreements
with the Socialist-Revolutionaries to combat tsarism.  

The Socialist-Revolutionary Party’s political and ideological
instability and organisational incohesion, as well as its constant
vacillation between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat, were due
to the absence of class homogeneity among the peasantry. During the first
Russian revolution, the Right wing of the S.R.s broke away from the party
and formed the legal Labour Popular Socialist Party, whose views were close
to those of the Constitutional-Democrats

   

(Cadets), while the Left wing split away and formed a semi-anarchist league
of “Maximalists”. During the period of the Stolypin reaction, the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party suffered a complete break-down ideologically
and organisationally. During the First World War most of its members took a
social-chauvinist stand.  

After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917 the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, together with the Mensheviks and the Cadets,
were the mainstay of the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government of
the bourgeoisie and landlords. The leaders of the S.R. Party—Kerensky,
Avksentyev and Chernov—were members of this Cabinet. The S.R. Party
refused to support the peasants’ demand for the abolition of landlordism,
and stood for the preservation of landlord ownership. The S.R. members of
the Provisional Government authorised punitive action against peasants who
had seized landed estates.  

At the end of November 1917 the Left win of the S.R. Party formed an
independent party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who, in an endeavour
to preserve their influence among the peas ant masses, formally recognised
Soviet rule and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks. Shortly,
however, they began a struggle against the Soviets.  

During the years of foreign intervention and the Civil War the S.R.s
carried on counter-revolutionary subversive activities. They actively
supported the interventionists and whiteguards, took part in
counter-revolutionary plots, and organised terroristic acts against leaders
of the Soviet state and the Communist Party. After the Civil War, the S.R.s
continued their anti-Soviet activities within the country and in the camp
of the White émigrés.





[6]
The Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna)—a
reformist nationalist organisation founded in 1892. Adopting the slogan of
struggle for an independent Poland, the P.S.P., under Pilsudski and his
adherents, carried on separatist nationalist propaganda among the Polish
workers, whom they tried to divert from the joint struggle with the Russian
workers against the autocracy and capitalism. Throughout the history of the
P.S.P. Left-wing groups kept springing up within the party, as a result of
the activities of the rank-and-file workers. Some of these groups
eventually joined the revolutionary wing of the Polish working-class
movement.  

In 1906 the party split up into the P.S.P. Left wing and the Right,
chauvinist wing (the so-called “revolutionary faction”).  Under the
influence of the Bolsheviks and the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and
Lithuania, the Left wing gradually adopted a consistent revolutionary
stand.  

During the First World War some of the P.S.P. Left-wing adopted an
internationalist stand. In December 1918 it united with the
Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania to form the Communist Workers’
Party of Poland (as the Communist Party of Poland was known up to 1925).



During the First World War, the P.S.P. flight wing continued its policy
of national chauvinism, organising Polish legions on the territory of
Galicia to fight on the side of Austin-German imperialism. With the
formation of the Polish bourgeois state, the Right P.S.P. in 1919 united
with the P.S.P. organisations existing on Polish territories formerly
seized by Germany and Austria, and resumed the name of the P.S.P. At the
head of the government, it arranged for the transfer of power to the Polish
bourgeoisie, systematically carried on anti-communist propaganda, and
supported a policy of aggression against the Soviet Union, a policy of
conquest and oppression against Western Ukraine and Western
Byelorussia. Various groups in the P.S.P. who disagreed with this policy
joined the Communist Party of Poland.  

After Pilsudski’s fascist coup d’état (May 1926), the P.S.P. was
nominally a parliamentary opposition, but actually it did not carry on any
active fight against the fascist regime, and continued its anti-communist
and anti-Soviet propaganda. During that period the Left-wing elements of
the P.S.P. collaborated with the Polish Communists and supported
united-front tactics in a number of campaigns.  

During the Second World War the P.S.P. again split up. Its reactionary
and chauvinist faction, which assumed the name “Wolno&swhatthe&cwhatthe,
Równosc, Niepod&lwhattheeglo&swhatthe&cwhatthe” (Liberty,
Equality, Independence), took part in the reactionary Polish
émigré “government” in London. The Left faction, which
called itself the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists, under the influence
of the Polish Workers’ Party, which was founded in 1942, joined the popular
front against the Nazi invaders, fought for Poland’s liberation, and
pursued a policy of friendly relations with the U.S.S.R.  

In 1944, after the liberation of Poland’s eastern territories and the
formation of a Polish Committee of National Liberation, the Workers’ Party
of Polish Socialists resumed the name of P.S.P. and together with the
P.W.P. participated in the building up of a people’s democratic Poland. In
December 1948 the P.W.P. and the P.S.P. amalgamated and formed the Polish
United Workers’ Party.





[9]
Luch (Ray)—a legal daily of the Menshevik
liquidators, published in St. Petersburg from September 16(29), 1912 to
July 5(18), 1913. Put out 237 issues. The newspaper was maintained chiefly
by contributions from the liberals. Ideological leadership was in the bands
of P. B. Axelrod, F. I. Dan, L. Martov, and A. S. Martynov. The liquidators
used the columns of this newspaper to oppose the revolutionary tactics of
the Bolsheviks, advocate the opportunist slogan of an “open party”,
attack the revolutionary mass strikes of the workers, and attempt to revise
the most important points of the Party Programme. Lenin wrote that
Luch was “enslaved by a liberal policy” and called the paper a
mouthpiece of the renegades.





[10]
Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment)—a Bolshevik, legal
theoretical monthly, published in St. Petersburg from December 1911 to
June 1914, with a circulation of up to five thousand copies.  

The journal was founded on Lenin’s initiative to replace the
Moscow-published Mysl, a Bolshevik journal which was closed down
by the tsarist government. Other workers on the new journal were
V. V. Vorovsky, A. I. Ulyanova-Yelizarova, N. K. Krupskaya and
others. Lenin enlisted the services of Maxim Gorky to run the journal’s
literary section. Lenin directed Prosveshcheniye from Paris and
subsequently from Cracow and Poronin. He edited articles and regularly
corresponded with the editorial staff. The journal published the following
articles by Lenin: “The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of
Marxism”, “Critical Remarks on the National Question”, “The Right of
Nations to Self-Determination”, “Disruption of Unity Under Cover of
Outcries for Unity” and others.  

The journal exposed the opportunists—the liquidators, otzovists, and
Trotskyists, as well as the bourgeois nationalists. It highlighted the
struggle of the working class under conditions of a new revolutionary
upsurge, propagandised Bolshevik slogans in the Fourth Duma election
campaign, and came out against revisionism and centrism in the parties of
the Second International. The journal played an important role in the
Marxist inter nationalist education of the advanced workers of Russia.


On the eve of World War I, Prosveshcheniye was closed down by
the tsarist government. It resumed publication in the autumn of 1917, but
only one issue (a double one) appeared, containing Lenin’s “Can the
Bolsheviks Retain State Power?” and “A Review of the Party Programme”.





[7]
Bernsteinism—an anti-Marxist trend in international
Social-Democracy. It arose towards the close of the nineteenth century in
Germany and bore the name of the German opportunist Social-Democrat Eduard
Bernstein. After the death of F. Engels, Bernstein publicly advocated
revision of Marx’s revolutionary theory in the spirit of bourgeois
liberalism (see his article “Problems of Socialism” and his book The
Premises of Socialism and the Tasks of Social-Democracy) in an attempt
to convert the Social-Democratic Party into a petty-bourgeois party of
social reforms. In Russia this trend was represented by the “legal
Marxists”, the Economists, the Bundists; and the Mensheviks.





[8]
Lenin refers to Stalin’s article “Marxism and the National Question”
published in the legal Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye, Nos. 3,
4 and 5 for 1913 under the title “The National Question and
Social-Democracy”. Chapter 4 of Stalin’s article quotes the text of the
national programme adopted at the Br\"unn Congress of the Austrian
Social-Democratic Party.

## Equality of Nations and
      the Rights of National Minorities









Lenin: 1913/crnq: 5. THE EQUALITY OF NATIONS AND THE RIGHTS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES







V. I.  

      Lenin
Critical Remarks on the National Question



    

5. THE EQUALITY OF NATIONS AND THE RIGHTS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES

When they discuss the national question, opportunists in Russia are
given to citing the example of Austria. In my article in Severnaya
     Pravda[1]

(No. 10, Prosveshcheniye, pp. 96–98), which the opportunists have
attacked (Mr. Semkovsky in Novaya Rabochaya
Gazeta,[4] and Mr. Liebman in Zeit), I asserted that,
insofar as that is at all possible under capitalism, there was only one
solution of the national question, viz., through consistent democracy. In
proof of this, I referred, among other things, to Switzerland.  

This has not been to the liking of the two opportunists mentioned
above, who are trying to refute it or belittle its significance. Kautsky,
we are told, said that Switzerland is an exception; Switzerland, if you
please, has a special kind of decentralisation, a special history, special
geographical conditions, unique distribution of a population that speak
different languages, etc., etc.  

All these are nothing more than attempts to evade the
issue. To be sure, Switzerland is an exception in that she is not a
single-nation state. But Austria and Russia are also exceptions (or are
backward, as Kautsky adds). To be sure, it was only her special, unique
historical and social conditions that ensured Switzerland greater
democracy than most of her European neighbours.  

But where does all this come in, if we are speaking of the
model to be adopted? In the whole world, under present-day
conditions, countries in which any particular institution has been founded
on consistent democratic principles are the exception. Does this
prevent us, in our programme, from upholding consistent democracy in all
institutions?  
 

Switzerland’s special features lie in her history, her geographical and
other conditions. Russia’s special features lie in the strength of her
proletariat, which has no precedent in the epoch of bourgeois revolutions,
and in her shocking general backwardness, which objectively necessitates an
exceptionally rapid and resolute advance, under the threat of all sorts of
drawbacks and reverses.  

We are evolving a national programme from the proletarian standpoint;
since when has it been recommended that the worst examples, rather than the
best, be taken as a model?  

At all events, does it not remain an indisputable and undisputed fact
that national peace under capitalism has been achieved (insofar as it is
achievable) exclusively in countries where consistent democracy
prevails?  

Since this is indisputable, the opportunists’ persistent references to
Austria instead of Switzerland are nothing but a typical Cadet device, for
the
Cadets[5] always copy the worst European constitutions rather than the
best.  

In Switzerland there are three official languages, but bills
submitted to a referendum are printed in five languages, that is
to say, in two Romansh dialects, in addition to the three official
languages. According to the 1900 census, these two dialects are spoken by
38,651 out of the 3,315,443 inhabitants of Switzerland, i.e., by a little
over one per cent. In the army, commissioned and non-commissioned
officers “are given the fullest freedom to speak to the men in their
native language”. In the cantons of Graub\"unden and Wallis (each with a
population of a little over a hundred thousand) both dialects enjoy
complete
      equality.[2]


The question is: should we advocate and support this, the living
experience of an advanced country, or borrow from the Austrians
inventions like “extra-territorial autonomy”, which have not yet
been tried out anywhere in the world (and not yet been adopted by the
Austrians themselves)?  

To advocate this invention is to advocate the division of school
education according to nationality, and that is a downright harmful
idea. The experience of Switzerland

    

proves, however, that the greatest (relative) degree of national peace
can be, and has been, ensured in practice where you have, a
consistent (again relative) democracy throughout the state.  


   “In Switzerland,” say people who have studied this
   question, “there is no national question in the East-European
   sense of the term. The very phrase (national, question) is unknown
   there....”
   “Switzerland left the struggle between nationalities a long way behind, in

    1797–1803.”[3]



This means that the epoch of the great French Revolution, which
provided the most democratic solution of the current problems of the
transition from feudalism to capitalism, succeeded incidentally,
en passant, in “solving” the national question.  

Let the Semkovskys, Liebmans, and other opportunists now fry to assert
that this “exclusively Swiss” solution is inapplicable to any
uyezd or even part of an uyezd in Russia, where out of a population of only
200,000 forty thousand speak two dialects and want to have
complete equality of language in their area!  

Advocacy of complete equality of nations and languages distinguishes
only the consistently democratic elements in each nation (i. e., only the
proletarians), and unites them, not according to nationality, but
in a profound and earnest desire to improve the entire system of state. On
the contrary, advocacy of “cultural-national autonomy”, despite the pious
wishes of individuals and groups, divides the nations and in fact
draws the workers and the bourgeoisie of any one nation closer together
(the adoption of this “cultural-national autonomy” by all the Jewish
bourgeois parties).  

Guaranteeing the rights of a national minority is inseparably linked up
with the principle of complete equality. In my article in Severnaya
Pravda this principle was ex pressed in almost the same terms as in
the later, official and more accurate decision of the conference of
Marxists. That decision demands “the incorporation in the constitution of
a fundamental law which shall declare null and void all privileges enjoyed
by any one nation and all infringements of the rights of a national
minority”.  
 

Mr. Liebman tries to ridicule this formula and asks:
“Who knows what the rights of a national minority are?” Do these rights,
he wants to know, include the right of the minority to have “its own
programme” for the national schools? How large must the national minority
be to have the right to have its own judges, officials, and schools with
instruction in its own language? Mr. Liebman wants it to be inferred from
these questions that a “positive” national programme is
essential.  

Actually, these questions clearly show what reactionary ideas our
Bundist tries to smuggle through under cover of a dispute on supposedly
minor details and particulars.  

“Its own programme” in its national schools!... Marxists, my dear
nationalist-socialist, have a general school programme which
demands, for example, an absolutely secular school. As far as Marxists are
concerned, no departure from this general programme is anywhere or
at any time permissible in a democratic state (the question of introducing
any “local” subjects, languages, and so forth into it being decided by
the local inhabitants). However, from the principle of “taking educational
affairs out of the hands of the state” and placing them under the control
of the nations, it ensues that we, the workers, must allow the “nations”
in our democratic state to spend the people’s money on clerical schools!
Without being aware of the fact, Mr. Liebman has clearly demonstrated the
reactionary nature of “cultural-national autonomy”!  

“How large must a national minority be?” This is not defined even in
the Austrian programme, of which the Bundists are enamoured. It says (more
briefly and less clearly than our programme does): “The rights of the
national minorities are protected by a special law to he passed by the
Imperial Parliament” (§4 of the Br\"unn programme).  

Why has nobody asked the Austrian Social-Democrats the question: what
exactly is that law, and exactly which rights and of which minority is it
to protect?  

That is because all sensible people understand that it is inappropriate
and impossible to define particulars in a programme. A programme lays down
only fundamental principles. In this case the fundamental principle is
implied with the Austrians, and directly expressed in the decision of the

    

latest conference of Russian Marxists. That principle is:
no national privileges and no national inequality.  

Let us take a concrete example to make the point clear to the
Bundist. According to the school census of January 18, 1911, St. Petersburg
elementary schools under the Ministry of Public “Education” were attended
by 48,076 pupils. Of these, 396, i. e., less than one per cent, were
Jews. The other figures are: Rumanian pupils—2, Georgians—1,
Armenians—3,
etc.[6] Is it possible to draw up a “positive” national programme that
will cover this diversity of relationships and conditions? (And
St. Petersburg is, of course, far from being the city with the most mixed
population in Russia.) Even such specialists in national “subtleties” as
the Bundists would hardly be able to draw up such a programme.  

And yet, if the constitution of the country contained a fundamental law
rendering null and void every measure that infringed the rights of a
minority, any citizen would be able to demand the rescinding of orders
prohibiting, for example, the hiring, at state expense, of special teachers
of Hebrew, Jewish history, and the like, or the provision of state-owned
premises for lectures for Jewish, Armenian, or Rumanian children, or even
for the one Georgian child. At all events, it is by no means impossible to
meet, on the basis of equality, all the reasonable and just wishes of the
national minorities, and nobody will say that advocacy of equality is
harmful. On the other hand, it would certainly be harmful to advocate
division of schools according to nationality, to advocate, for example,
special schools for Jewish children in St. Petersburg, and it would be
utterly impossible to set up national schools for every national
minority, for one, two or three children.  

Furthermore, it is impossible, in any country-wide law, to define how
large a national minority must be to be entitled to special schools, or to
special teachers for supplementary subjects, etc.  

On the other hand, a country-wide law establishing equality can be
worked out in detail and developed through special regulations and the
decisions of regional Diets, and town, Zemstvo, village commune and other
authorities.

Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta (New Workers’ Paper)—a
legal daily of the Menshevik liquidators, published in St. Petersburg from

   

August 1913. From January 30 (February 12), 1914 it was superceded by
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta (Northern Workers’ Paper) and
subsequently by Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta (Our Workers’
Paper). Lenin repeatedly referred to this newspaper as the Novaya
Likvidatorskaya Gazeta (New Liquidationist Paper).





[5]
Cadets—members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the
principal party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia. It was
formed in October 1905 and consisted of representatives of the bourgeoisie,
landlord members of the Zemstvos, and bourgeois intellectuals. Prominent
leaders of the Cadets were: =

P. N. Milyukov, S. A. Muromtsev, V. A. Maklakov, A. I. Shingaryov,
P. B. Struve and F. I. Rodichev. To mislead the masses the Cadets called
themselves the “party of people’s freedom”, but actually they went no
further than the demand for a constitutional monarchy. They considered the
fight against the revolutionary movement their chief aim, and strove to
share power with the tsar and the feudalist landlords. During World War I
the Cadets actively supported the tsarist government’s aggressive foreign
policy, and during the February 1917 bourgeois-democratic revolution they
tried to save the monarchy. Holding key posts in the bourgeois Provisional
Government, the Cadets pursued an anti-popular and counter-revolutionary
policy. After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the Cadets
came out as the avowed enemies of Soviet rule, taking part in all armed
counter-revolutionary acts and campaigns of the interventionists. Living
abroad as émigrés after the defeat of the interventionists
and whiteguards, the Cadets continued their anti-Soviet activities.

## Centralisation and
      Autonomy









Lenin: 1913/crnq: 6. CENTRALISATION AND AUTONOMY







V. I.  

      Lenin
Critical Remarks on the National Question



    

6. CENTRALISATION AND AUTONOMY

In his rejoinder, Mr. Liebman writes: 


   “Take our Lithuania, the Baltic province, Poland,
   Volhynia, South Russia, etc—everywhere you will find a mixed
   population; there is not a single city that does not have a large national
   minority. However far decentralisation is carried out, different
   nationalities will always be found living together in different places
   (chiefly in urban communities); and it is democratism that surrenders a
   national minority to the national majority. But, as we know, V. I. is
   opposed to the federal state structure and the boundless decentralisation
   that exist in the Swiss Federation. The question is: what was his point in
   citing the example of Switzerland?”  


My object in citing the example of Switzerland has already been
explained above. I have also explained that the problem of protecting the
rights of a national minority can be solved only by a country-wide
law promulgated in a consistently democratic state that does not depart
from the principle of equality.  But in the passage quoted above,
Mr. Liebman repeats still another of the most common (and most fallacious)
arguments (or sceptical remarks) which are usually made against the Marxist
national programme, and which, therefore, deserve examination.  

Marxists are, of course, opposed to federation and decentralisation,
for the simple reason that capitalism requires for its development the
largest and most centralised possible states. Other conditions being
equal, the class-conscious proletariat will always stand for the
larger state. It will always fight against medieval particularism, and will
always welcome the closest possible economic amalgamation of large
territories in which the proletariat’s struggle against the bourgeoisie can
develop on a broad basis.  

Capitalism’s broad and rapid development of the productive forces
calls for large, politically compact and united territories, since
only here can the bourgeois class—together with its inevitable antipode,
the proletarian class—unite and sweep away all the old, medieval, caste,
parochial, petty-national, religious and other barriers.  

The right of nations to self-determination, i. e., the right to secede
and form independent national states, will be dealt with

      elsewhere.[1]

But while, and insofar as, different

    

nations constitute a single state, Marxists will never, under any
circumstances, advocate either the federal principle or
decentralisation. The great centralised state is a tremendous historical
step forward from medieval disunity to the future socialist unity of the
whole world, and only via such a state (inseparably
connected with capitalism), can there be any road to socialism.  

It would, however, be inexcusable to forget that in advocating
centralism we advocate exclusively democratic centralism. On this
point all the philistines in general, and the nationalist philistines in
particular (including the late
Dragomanov[7]), have so confused the issue that we are obliged again and
again to spend time clarifying it.  

Far from precluding local self-government, with autonomy for
regions having special economic and social conditions, a distinct national
composition of the population, and so forth, democratic centralism
necessarily demands both. In Russia centralism is constantly
confused with tyranny and bureaucracy. This confusion has naturally arisen
from the history of Russia, but even so it is quite inexcusable for a
Marxist to yield to it.  

This can best be explained by a concrete example.  

In her lengthy article “The National Question and
     Autonomy”,[2]

Rosa Luxemburg, among many other curious errors (which we shall deal with
below), commits the exceptionally curious one of trying to
restrict the demand for autonomy to Poland alone.  

But first let us see how she defines autonomy.  

Rosa Luxemburg admits—and being a Marxist she is of course bound to
admit—that all the major and important economic and political questions
of capitalist, society must be dealt with exclusively by the central
parliament of the whole country concerned, not by the autonomous Diets of
the individual regions. These questions include tariff policy, laws
governing commerce and industry, transport and means of communication
(railways, post, telegraph, telephone, etc.), the army, the taxation
system,
civil[3]

and criminal

    

law, the general principles of education (for example, the law on purely
secular schools, on universal education, on the minimum programme, on
democratic school management, etc.), the labour protection laws, and
political liberties (right of association), etc., etc.  

The autonomous Diets—on the basis of the general laws of the
country—should deal with questions of purely local, regional, or national
significance. Amplifying this idea in great—not to say
excessive—detail, Rosa Luxemburg mentions, for example, the construction
of local railways (No. 12, p. 149) and local highways (No. 14–15, p. 376),
etc.  

Obviously, one cannot conceive of a modern, truly democratic state that
did not grant such autonomy to every region having any appreciably distinct
economic and social features, populations of a specific national
composition, etc. The principle of centralism, which is essential for the
development of capitalism, is not violated by this (local and regional)
autonomy, but on the contrary is applied by it democratically, not
bureaucratically. The broad, free and rapid development of capitalism would
be impossible, or at least greatly impeded, by the absence of such
autonomy, which facilitates the concentration of capital, the
development of the productive forces, the unity of the bourgeoisie and the
unity of the proletariat on a country-wide scale; for bureaucratic
interference in purely local (regional, national, and other)
questions is one of the greatest obstacles to economic and political
development in general, and an obstacle to centralism in serious,
important and fundamental matters in particular.  

One cannot help smiling, therefore, when reading how our magnificent
Rosa Luxemburg tries to prove, with a very serious air and “purely
Marxist” phrases, that the demand for autonomy is applicable only
to Poland and only by way of exception! Of course, there is not a
grain of “parochial” patriotism in this; we have here only “practical”
considerations ... in the case of Lithuania, for example.  

Rosa Luxemburg takes four gubernias—Vilna, Kovno, Grodno and
Suvalki—assuring her readers (and herself) that these are inhabited
“mainly” by Lithuanians; and by adding the inhabitants of these gubernias
together she finds

    

that Lithuanians constitute 23 per cent of the total population, and if
Zhmuds are added, they constitute 31 per cent—less than a third. The
natural inference is that the idea of autonomy for Lithuania is “arbitrary
and artificial” (No. 10, p. 807).  

The reader who is familiar with the commonly known defects of our
Russian official statistics will quickly see Rosa Luxemburg’s mistake. Why
take Grodno Gubernia where the Lithuanians constitute only 0.2 per cent,
one-fifth of one per cent, of the population? Why take the whole
Vilna Gubernia and not its Troki Uyezd alone, where the Lithuanians
constitute the majority of the population? Why take the whole
Suvalki Gubernia and put the number of Lithuanians at 52 per cent of the
population, and not the Lithuanian uyezds of that gubernia, i. e., five out
of the seven, in which Lithuanians constitute 72 per cent of the
population?  

It is ridiculous to talk about the conditions and demands of modern
capitalism while at the same time taking not the “modern”, not the
“capitalist”, but the medieval, feudal and official-bureaucratic
administrative divisions of Russia, and in their crudest form at that
(gubernias instead of uyezds). Plainly, there can be no question of any
serious local reform in Russia until these divisions are abolished and
superseded by a really “modern” division that really meets the
requirements, not of the Treasury, not of the
bureaucracy, not of routine, not of the landlords,
not of the priests, but of capitalism; and one of the modern
requirements of capitalism is undoubtedly the greatest possible national
uniformity of the population, for nationality and language identity are an
important factor making for the complete conquest of the home market and
for complete freedom of economic intercourse.  

Oddly enough, this obvious mistake of Rosa Luxemburg’s is repeated by
the Bundist Medem, who sets out to prove, not that Poland’s specific
features are “exceptional”, but that the principle of
national-territorial autonomy is unsuitable (the Bundists stand for
national extra-territorial autonomy!). Our Bundists and liquidators collect
from all over the world all the errors and all the opportunist vacillations
of Social-Democrats of different countries and different

    

nations and appropriate to themselves the worst they can find in
world Social-Democracy. A scrap-book of Bundist and liquidator writings
could, taken together, serve as a model Social-Democratic museum of bad
taste.  

Regional autonomy, Medem tells us didactically, is good for a region or
a “territory”, but not for Lettish, Estonian, or other areas
(okrugs), which have populations ranging from half a million to
two million and areas equal to a gubernia. “That would not be
autonomy, but simply a Zemstvo.... Over this Zemstvo it would be
necessary to establish real autonomy” ... and the author goes on to
condemn the “break-up” of the old gubernias and
       uyezds.[4]


As a matter of fact, the preservation of the medieval, feudal, official
administrative divisions means the “break up” and mutilation of the
conditions of modern capitalism. Only people imbued with the spirit of
these divisions can, with the learned air of the expert, speculate on the
contra-position of “Zemstvo” and “autonomy”, calling for the
stereotyped application of “autonomy” to large regions and of the Zemstvo
to small ones. Modern capitalism does not demand these bureaucratic
stereotypes at all. Why national areas with populations, not only of half a
million, but even of 50,000, should not be able to enjoy autonomy; why such
areas should not be able to unite in the most diverse ways with
neighbouring areas of different dimensions into a single autonomous
“territory” if that is convenient or necessary for economic
intercourse—these things remain the secret of the Bundist Medem.  

We would mention that the Br\"unn Social-Democratic national programme
is based entirely on national-territorial autonomy; it proposes that
Austria should be divided into “nationally distinct” areas “instead of
the historical crown lands” (Clause 2 of the Br\"unn programme). We would
not go as far as that. A uniform national population is undoubtedly one of
the most reliable factors making for free, broad and really modern
commercial intercourse. It is beyond doubt that not a single Marxist, and
not even a single firm democrat, will stand up for the Austrian crown lands

    

and the Russian gubernias and uyezds (the latter are not as bad as the
Austrian crown lands, but they are very bad nevertheless), or challenge the
necessity of replacing these obsolete divisions by others that will conform
as far as possible with the national composition of the population, Lastly,
it is beyond doubt that in order to eliminate all national oppression it is
very important to create autonomous areas, however small, with entirely
homogeneous populations, towards which members of the respective
nationalities scattered all over the country, or even all over the world,
could gravitate, and with which they could enter into relations and free
associations of every kind. All this is indisputable, and can be argued
against only from the hidebound, bureaucratic point of view.  

The national composition of the population, however, is one of
the very important economic factors, but not the sole and not the
most important factor. Towns, for example, play an extremely
important economic role under capitalism, and everywhere, in Poland,
in Lithuania, in the Ukraine, in Great Russia, and elsewhere, the towns are
marked by mixed populations To cut the towns off from the villages and
areas that economically gravitate towards them, for the sake of the
“national” factor, would be absurd and impossible. That is why Marxists
must not take their stand entirely and exclusively on the
“national-territorial” principle.  

The solution of the problem proposed by the last conference of Russian
Marxists is far more correct than the Austrian. On this question, the
conference advanced the following proposition: 


   “...must provide for wide regional autonomy (not for
   Poland alone, of course, but for all the regions of
       Russia][5]

   and fully democratic local self-government, and the boundaries of the
   self-governing and autonomous regions must he determined [not by the
   boundaries of the present gubernias, uyezds, etc., but] by the local
   inhabitants themselves on the basis of their economic and social
   conditions, national make-up of the population, etc.”

  [6]



Here the national composition of the population is placed on the
same level as the other conditions (economic first,

    

then social, etc.) which must serve as a basis for determining the new
boundaries that will meet the needs of modern capitalism, not of
bureaucracy and Asiatic barbarism. The local population alone can
“assess” those conditions with full precision, and on that basis the
central parliament of the country will determine the boundaries of the
autonomous regions and the powers of autonomous Diets.  
 *     *  * 

We have still to examine the question of the right of nations to
self-determination. On this question a whole collection of opportunists of
all nationalities—the liquidator Semkovsky, the Bundist Liebman and the
Ukrainian nationalist-socialist Lev Yurkevich—have set to work to
“popularise” the errors of Rosa Luxemburg. This question, which has been
so utterly confused by this whole “collection”, will be dealt with in our
next
article.[8]

The characteristic feature of the publicists of the
Novaya Likvidatorskaya Gazeta, namely, hypocrisy goaded on by
impotent malice, has never reached such limits as it has in their articles
concerning the decision of the International
Bureau.[1] 

To what lengths they have gone can be seen from the fact that, after
their very first articles on this subject, Huysmans, the Secretary of the
International Socialist Bureau, felt constrained to authorise Comrade Popov
to convey to the Russian workers his protest against the attempts of
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta to “exploit, in its factional interests,
the lack of information” of the Russian readers, his protest against the
“utter inaccuracy and disloyalty” of the liquidators’ published reports
concerning the Bureau’s decisions.  

Since the Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta publicists have received
such a resounding ... testimonial from the Bureau’s Secretary, we can
calmly ignore their attempts to accuse us of distorting the true
character of the decisions passed in London. People who have been publicly
accused by the Secretary of the Bureau of “exploiting” the Bureau’s
decisions “in their factional interests” and of being “disloyal” to
them, may shout as much as they please about their respect for the
International, etc., but scarcely anyone will believe them. Every worker
knows now what name to give the manipulations by which
Mr. D.[2] tries so hard to read into the resolution of the Bureau such
things as “the methods of building” the Party, “condemnation” of the
Six,[3] “rejection” of our “claims” and “recognition” of the
Social-Democratic

    

character of the Left
wing.[4] Literary juggling with the resolutions of the Bureau is hardly
a sign of respect for those resolutions, Mr. D.!  

How great, though, is the confusion of these jugglers! See how they are
forced to contradict themselves at every turn!  

1) In No. 102, Mr. D. solemnly stated: “The International Socialist
Bureau censured the six deputies for resigning from the Duma
group. In issue No. 104, another juggler,
Mr. L.S.,[5] no less solemnly declared: “The International Socialist
Bureau handed out neither testimonials nor censure.” And—please
note!—both gentlemen are highly pleased with the Bureau’s decision; one
because it “censured”, and the other because it did not! Can one imagine
a picture of greater confusion?  

Indeed, there was good reason for the liquidators’ confusion! The main
point of the Bureau’s resolution states unequivocally the following:
“Any practical step towards unity must be preceded by a preliminary
clarification of existing differences.”  

This decision is a perfectly correct one.  

If we do not want to present the working class with a hodgepodge of
miscellaneous elements miscalled “unity”, and if we want real unity of
action, the first obligatory step in this direction must be to
ascertain exactly what the “points of disagreement” are. Let us first
ascertain exactly the “points of disagreement” by means of a “general
exchange of opinion”, and then it will become clear whether it is possible
to talk about any practical steps towards unity. That is how the question
is formulated in the Bureau’s resolution. We whole-heartedly approve of
this formulation. We responded to the proposal of the International
Socialist Bureau by calling upon the workers calmly and thoughtfully to
discuss our disagreements once more, and to express their views on the
points of disagreement. We, for our part, promised to do all we could to
help familiarise our foreign comrades with the existing differences. The
resolution published in Proletarskaya Pravda, No. 9, gives a quite
correct summary of the points on which we and the
liquidators[6] disagree. This is what our reply to the Bureau’s proposal
should be, and of course, there could be no other line of action for those
who have serious

    

consideration for the Bureau’s decision to promote a “general exchange of
opinion on the points of disagreement”.  

But—and this is the whole point—no task is more unpleasant,
undesirable, and unacceptable to the liquidators than that of ascertaining
our main differences on questions of theory, programme, tactics and
organisation. All their subterfuges, distortions and abuse in connection
with the Bureau’s resolution are solely designed to obscure its
demand for a preliminary clarification of differences. Both Mr. L.S. and
Mr. D. run ahead zealously: could we not somehow “unite” without
“certificates” giving the ideological “service record” of those
uniting? Gould we not do without “quotations from old journals and
newspapers”?—Mr. L. S. worries. Could we not stop recalling “the
past”?—Mr. D. pleads. We understand them very well: there is nothing
pleasant for Mr. L. S. in the recollections of articles about the
“underground” (Luch No. 15 [101]), or for Mr. D. in
recollections of the “fight-for-legality” slogan. And we fully endorse
the Bureau’s decision insofar as it proposes that the errors of the past
should not be raked up. We shall not deny the liquidators the amnesty for
the “errors of the past”, for which they plead. The past, as such, does
not interest us; what does interest us is the work of today and
tomorrow. As regards that work, we want to know whether the campaign
against the “underground” conducted in the liquidationist press is to
continue, whether they will continue to argue that the
“three
pillars”[7] are inapplicable at the present time, whether they will
defend the distortion of the programme by the August bloc
people[8] and so forth.  

The clarification of these questions and of the degree to which we
differ on them is, according to the Bureau’s resolution, a
precondition to any progress towards unity, if we are not to
accept “unity” in the liquidationist meaning of lumping together, without
regard for principles, all who care to call themselves Social-Democrats.


“The counts of the indictment have already been drawn up,”
Mr. L. S. thunders. We should not like to recall here the story about the
thief who fears his own shadow, but why does Mr. L. S. take ordinary peace
terms to be an “indictment”? We say: the organisation to be created as a
result of unity should be based on such and such principles—acceptance

    

of the old programme, a definite form of organisation, uncurtailed
slogans,[9] resolute tactics, etc. But you immediately declare that this
formulation of the programme, tactics and tasks of the organisation, is
nothing but a “complete list of liquidators’ sins”. We are sorry for you,
but neither we nor the Bureau know of any method of building new
organisations other than by clarifying their programme, their tactics, and
so forth.  

We are guilty of a still more grievous sin, however. Not only have we
proposed the conditions for the creation of an organisation, i. e.,
clarified the terms of peace, but we have, moreover, submitted these terms
to the bar of the workers’ opinion.  

We maintain that there is no other way of carrying out the Bureau’s
decision than the one we have chosen.  

The Bureau calls upon all those who profess to be
Social-Democrats to clarify their differences as a preliminary step towards
solving the problem of unity.  

The resolution we published responded to the Bureau’s appeal by giving
a “list” of views on the basic questions of programme, tactics and
organisation, and by submitting our “list” to the workers, for their
consideration. If the liquidators were to follow our example, we would
have, in the more or less near future, the clearly formulated opinions of
all parties, and a clear idea as to which side has the support of the
majority of the organised workers. The task set before the Russian
proletariat by the International Socialist Bureau would be brought nearer
to fulfilment. But the liquidators, of course, will to the very last shun
this path, for the simple reason that neither a precise formulation of
their political views nor the submission of these views to the bar of the
broad circles of the workers is in the interests of their group.  

Under these circumstances they will inevitably strive to substitute for
the definite “clarification of differences” demand ed by the Bureau,
petty personal squabbles, distortions, and wilful misrepresentations, which
can only hamper its work, and they will constantly necessitate those
lessons in “loyalty” which the Secretary of the International has already
been compelled to teach the liquidators.

[1]
The International Socialist Bureau—the Executive of the
Second International, set up in accordance with the decision of the Paris
Congress in 1900. On December 14 (new style), 1913 the I.S.B. resolved to
convene a conference “of all sections of the working-class movement in
Russia” in order to ascertain existing disagreements by means of “a
general exchange of opinions”, with the alleged purpose of restoring unity
in the R.S.D.L.P. This question was raised at a meeting of the I.S.B. on
the initiative of Rosa Luxemburg with the aim of supporting the Russian
liquidators, who had suffered defeat in their struggle against the
Bolsheviks. In connection with this decision of the I.S.B. the
liquidationist Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta published a telegram from
London reporting that the Bolsheviks’ demand that a representative of the
Social-Democratic Labour Party group in the Duma (the Six) should be sent
to the interparliamentary section of the Second International was rejected
at a meeting of the I.S.B. On instructions from Lenin, the representative
of the Central Committee in Brussels asked I.S.B. Secretary Huysmans what
he thought of this liquidationist trick. Huysmans was obliged publicly to
refute this false report of Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta.

Committee, the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region and the liquidators’
groups resident abroad, namely, the

   

editorial boards of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata, Trotsky’s Vienna
Pravda and the Vperyod group. Delegates from Russia were
sent by the St. Petersburg and Moscow “sponsor groups” of the liquidators
arid the editorial boards of the liquidationist publications Nasha
Zarya and Nevsky Golos. A representative of the
Spilki Committee Abroad was also present. The overwhelming
majority of delegates were resident abroad and out of touch with the
working class in Russia.  

The Conference adopted anti-Party liquidationist decisions on all
questions of Social-Democratic tactics, and declared against the existence
of an illegal Party. Unable to elect a Central Committee, the liquidators
confined themselves to setting up an Organising Committee. The August bloc,
which consisted of ill-assorted elements, began to fall apart at the
Conference itself, and soon broke down completely. (For details about the
August bloc see pp. 158–61 of this volume.)

Coming to the aid of the muddled Mr. Mogilyansky, the
editors of the liberal
Rech[1] recently (in issue No. 340) published an unsigned,
i. e., official and editorial statement on an important issue, namely, the
right of nations to self-determination.  

Evading a direct answer, Mr. Mogilyansky had asserted that his views
had “nothing in common with the repudiation of the right of nations to
self-determination”. Now Rech officially declares that Clause 11
of the Constitutional-Democratic Party programme gives a “direct, precise
and clear answer to the question of the right to free cultural
self-determination”.  

The word we have underlined is particularly important, since it was
not “cultural” self-determination that was discussed in
Mr. Mogilyansky’s first article, or in Mr. Dontsov’s reply to it, or in
Mr. Mogilyansky’s polemic with Mr. Dontsov. The question discussed was the
political self-determination of nations, i. e., the right of
nations to secede, whereas by “cultural self-determination” (a
meaningless, pompous phrase, which contradicts the entire history
of democracy) the liberals really mean only freedom of languages.  

Rech now declares that Proletarskaya Pravda
hopelessly confuses self-determination with “separatism”, with secession
by a nation.  

Which side is revealing hopeless (or perhaps deliberate...) confusion?


Will our enlightened “Constitutional-Democrats” deny that, throughout
the entire history of international democracy,

    

and especially since the middle of the nineteenth century,
self-determination of nations has been understood to mean precisely
political self-determination, i. e., the right to secede, to form
an independent national state?  

Will our enlightened “Constitutional-Democrats” deny that the
International Socialist Congress held in London in 1896, in reaffirming the
established democratic principle (to which, of course, the Congress did not
confine itself) also had in mind political and not some sort of
“cultural” self-determination?  

Will our enlightened “Constitutional-Democrats” deny that Plekhanov,
for example, who wrote about self-determination as far back as 1902,
thereby understood political self-determination?  

Please, gentlemen, explain yourselves more clearly; do not conceal the
fruits of your “enlightenment” from the “mob”!  

On the main issue Rech states: 

“Actually, the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate
the right of ‘nations to secede’ from the Russian state.”  

Splendid! Thank you for being so candid, and for making such an
explicit statement of principles! We draw the attention of
Rossiya, Novoye Vremya,
Zemshchina,[2] and others, to this “most loyal” statement by
the Cadets’ semi-official organ!  

But stay your ire, gentlemen of the Cadet Party, should you be called
national-liberals precisely for that reason. Herein lies one of
the root causes of your chauvinism and of your ideological and political
bloc with the Purishkeviches (or of your ideological and political
dependence upon them). The Purishkeviches and their class inculcate in the
ignorant masses the “firm” belief that it is “right” to “grab ’em and hold
’em”.[3] The Cadets have studied history and
know only too well what—to put it mildly—“pogrom-like” actions the
practice of this “ancient right” has often led to. A democrat could not
remain a democrat (let alone a proletarian democrat) without systematically
advocating, precisely among the Great-Russian masses and in the Russian
language, the “self-determination” of nations in the political amid not
in the “cultural” sense.  
 

Always and everywhere the characteristic feature of national-liberalism
lies in its taking a stand entirely on the basis of relations (and
boundaries) determined by the Purishkevich class and protected (often to
the detriment of economic development and of “culture”) by Purishkevich
methods. In effect, this means adapting oneself to the interests of the
feudal-minded landlords and to the worst nationalist prejudices of the
dominant nation, instead of systematically combating those prejudices.

[1]
Rech (Speech)—a daily published in St. Petersburg
from February 23 (March 8), 1906, as the central organ of the Cadet
Party. Its actual editors were P. N. Milyukov and I. V. Hessen, and its
close collaborators were M. M. Vinaver, P. D. Dolgorukov, P. B. Struve. The
newspaper was closed down on October 26 (November 8), 1917 by the
Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. Later (till
August 1918) it resumed publication under the names of Nasha Rech
(Our Speech), Svobodnaya Rech (Free Speech),
Vek (Century), Novaya Rech (New
Speech), and Nash Vek (Our Century).





[2]
Rossiya (Russia)—a reactionary, Black-hundred
daily, published in St. Petersburg from November 1905 to April 1914. In
1906 it became the organ of the Ministry of the Interior, being subsidised
out of the government’s secret (“reptile”) funds. Lenin called
Rossiya “a venal police rag”.  

Novoye Vremya (New Times)—a daily published in
St. Petersburg from 1868 to 1917. Owned by various publishers, it
frequently changed its political trend. It was moderately liberal at the
outset, but, after 1876, when it was published by A. S. Suvorin, it became
the organ of reactionary circles of the nobility and the bureaucracy. After
1905 it became a mouthpiece of the Black Hundreds. Following the February
bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917 the newspaper supported the
counter-revolutionary policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government and
hounded the Bolsheviks. It was closed down by the Revolutionary Military
Committee of the Petrograd Soviet on October 26 (November 8), 1917.  

Zemshchina—a Black-Hundred daily, published in
St. Petersburg from June 1909 to February 1917. Organ of the extreme
Right-wing deputies of the Duma.

“Grab ’em and hold ’em”—an expression used by the Russian
writer Gleb Uspensky to describe police tyranny.

The St. Petersburg Narodnik newspaper Severnaya
Mysl[1] recently published a report from Riga concerning the
progress of the insurance
campaign.[2] Among other things the author, B. Braines, wrote: 


   “The boycottist trend is apparent only among the
   shoemakers, where boycottist groups have been formed. Unfortunately, the
   Narodniks are the leading spirits in these groups. At the other factories
   the campaign is making little headway.”  


This candid confession throws a strong light on the present condition
and political significance of Narodism in Russia. The correctness of the
appraisal of Narodism made by the conference of
Marxists[3] is unexpectedly and strikingly confirmed by the Narodniks
themselves.  

Just think of it: a Left-Narodnik newspaper, unable to make any
refutation whatsoever, publishes the regrets of its correspondent
that the Narodniks are the “leading spirits” of the
boycottist groups!  

Here is a splendid illustration of the political, disintegration of
Narodism. Here is an example of Russian non-partyism and indifference to
the party principle. We must deal with this example, because an example
from the life of “another” party reveals to us with striking clarity the
true cause of an evil which is generally very widespread, and from which we
suffer considerably.  

During the period of counter-revolution a great variety of trends and
groups, all practically independent of one another, arose among the
Narodniks. In this respect, both the Narodniks and the Marxists were
evidently affected by the operation of the general causes stemming from the

    

entire historical situation created by the Third of June
system.[4] Among the Narodniks, individual groups came out in the press,
for example, in a far more liquidationist vein than was the case with us
(the Paris publications of 1908–10), and there were groups of quite an
anarchist character, and the most prominent writers of that trend began to
talk and write like liberals and renegades (Mr. V. Chernov in
Zavety[5]), and so forth.  

Nevertheless, formally and outwardly, the Narodniks appear to be much
more “united” than the Marxists are. There is no definite split
among the Narodniks, no intense, stubborn, systematic and prolonged inner
struggle among them. It seems, at first glance, as though they are all the
time held together by certain common ties. In their literature one
constantly comes across proud references to Narodnik “unity”, in contrast
with the “Marxist” (and most often “Bolshevik”) “tendency towards
discord and splits”.  

Those who want to understand the meaning and significance of what is
taking place in the working-class and socialist movements in Russia must
ponder very, very care fully over this contraposing of “Marxist splits”
and “Narodnik unity”.  

Among us Marxists and near-Marxists there are also no few groups and
grouplets which are practically almost independent of one another, and
which sedulously preach “unity” (quite in the Narodnik spirit), and still
more sedulously condemn “Marxist splits”.  

What does it all mean? Are we to envy “Narodnik unity”? Are we to
seek the reasons for this distinction in the pernicious qualities of
“certain” “leaders” (a very widespread method) or in the Marxists’
pernicious tendency towards “dogmatism”, “intolerance”, and so forth?


Consider the facts. These tell us that the Narodniks are far more
tolerant and conciliatory, that they are far more “united”, and that the
abundance of groups among them does not lead to sharp splits. At the same
time the facts tell us quite incontrovertibly that the Narodniks are
politically impotent, that they have no organised or durable
contacts with the masses, that they are incapable of any mass
political action. The example of the Narodnik boycottists in Riga merely
serves to illustrate most strikingly what was revealed

    

not only in the insurance campaign, but also in the Duma elections, the
strike movement, the working—class press (even more broadly, the
democratic press at large), the trade unions, and so forth. For example, we
read the following in issue No. 2 of the Left-Narodnik Severnaya
Mysl: 

“To the honour of the Marxists be it said that at present they enjoy
considerable influence in the unions [i. e., the trade
unions] whereas we Left Narodniks work in them without a definite
plan, and for that reason our influence is scarcely felt.”  

Strange, is it not? The conciliatory, tolerant, “united”,
non-splitting, broad-minded, non-dogmatic Narodniks—notwithstanding
their ardent desire and striving—conduct no insurance
campaign, exercise no influence on the trade unions, and have
no organised group in the Duma. But the “dogmatic” Marxists, who
are “for ever splitting” and thereby enfeebling themselves, fought a
splendid election campaign during the Fourth Duma elections, are conducting
successful activities in the trade unions, are running a splendid and
vigorous insurance campaign, carry on fairly effective activities in the
strike movement, pass unanimous decisions which are consistent in
principle, and are unanimously, firmly and with conviction supported by an
obvious and unquestionable majority of the class-conscious workers.  

Strange, is it not? Are not the “conciliatoriness”, and all the other
splendid spiritual qualities of the Narodniks merely sterile
things?  

That is exactly what they are—sterile! The “unity” of the varied
intellectualist little groups is bought by the Narodniks at the price, of
their utter political impotence among the masses. And with us Marxists,
too, it is the
Trotskyists,[6] the liquidators, the “conciliators”, and the
“Tyszka-ites”,[7] those who shout loudest about group unity, who
display the same intellectualist impotence, while the real
political campaigns, not the imaginary ones, but those that grow out of
actual conditions (election, insurance, daily press, strike campaigns,
etc.)  show that the majority of the class-conscious workers are
rallied around those who are most often, most zealously and most fiercely
accused of being “splitters”.  

The conclusion to be drawn is clear, and however unpalatable it may be
to the host of intellectualist groups the course

    

of the working-class movement will compel them to admit it. This
conclusion is that attempts to create “unity” by means of “agreements”
or “alliances” among intellectualist groups, which in fact
express tendencies that are injurious to the working-class
movement (Narodism, liquidationism, etc.), lead only to complete
disintegration and impotence. Both Narodism and liquidationism have
proved this by their lamentable example.  

Only in opposition to these groups and grouplets (in a
strenuous struggle, which is inevitable under bourgeois conditions and
amidst a host of petty-bourgeois vacillations) is real unity building up
among the working-class masses led by the majority of the class-conscious
proletarians.  

Na\"ive people will ask: How are we to distinguish the intellectualist
groups which are causing damage to the working-class movement by
disintegrating it and condemning it to impotence, from that group or groups
which ideologically express the working-class movement, rally, unite and
strengthen it? There are only two ways of distinguishing one from the
other: theory and practical experience. It is necessary seriously to
examine the theoretical content of such trends of thought as
Narodism and liquidationism (the principal petty-bourgeois trends that ate
disintegrating the working-class movement). It is necessary to carefully
study the practical experience of the mass working-class movement as a
means of rallying the majority of class-conscious workers around integral
and considered decisions, based on principle and applied in elections, in
insurance campaigns, in activities in the trade unions, in the strike
movement, in the “underground”, and so forth.  

He who gives close thought to the theory of Marxism and close attention
to the practical experience of the last few years will realise that the
elements of a genuine workers’ party are rallying in Russia in spite
of the motley, noisy, and vociferous (but essentially futile and
harmful) groups of Narodniks, liquidators, and so forth. Unity of the
working class is emerging from the disintegration of these groups and their
isolation from the proletariat.

Severnaya Mysl (Northern Thought)—one of the names
of the Left-Narodnik (Socialist-Revolutionary) legal newspaper Zhivaya
Mysl (Living Thought) published in St. Petersburg twice, then
three times a week, from August 1913 to July 1914. During that period the
newspaper changed its name ten times: Zavetnaya Mysl
(Cherished Thought), Volnaya Mysl (Free
Thought), Vernaya Mysl (True Thought), etc.





[2]
Insurance campaign refers to the struggle which developed in
connection with the elections to the insurance agencies. The campaign
started in the autumn of 1912 following the introduction by the tsarist
government on June 23, 1912, of a workers’ insurance law affecting only
twenty per cent of the workers. The Bolsheviks used these elections for
revolutionary propaganda and launched a campaign for the winning over of
legal workers’ organisations and legal workers’ associations. By combining
legal and illegal activities, the Bolsheviks succeeded in winning influence
in the insurance bodies. Elections to the Insurance Board were held in
March 1914, and a workers’ group on insurance affairs was formed under the
Board, which recognised as its official organ the Bolshevik journal
Voprosy Strakhovania (Insurance Questions).





[3]
Lenin is referring here to the Joint Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee and Party officials, held in the village
of Poronin on September 23–October 1 (October 6–14), 1913, and called,
for reasons of secrecy, the “August” (“Summer”) Conference. The
resolution on “The Narodniks” referred to here was drafted by Lenin. (See
present edition, Vol. 19, pp. 429–31.)





[4]
On June 3(16), 1907 the tsar issued a manifesto dissolving the
Second Duma and modifying, the electoral law. The new law considerably
increased the representation of the landlords and the commercial and
industrial bourgeoisie in the Duma, and made great cuts in the number of
peasants’ and workers’ representatives, which was small enough as it
is. This was a gross violation of the Manifesto of October 17, 1905 and the
Fundamental Law of 1906 by which no laws could be passed by the government
without approval by the Duma. The Third Duma, which was elected on the
basis of this law and met on November 1 (14), 1907, was a
Black-Hundred-Octobrist Duma.  

The coup d’état of June 3 ushered in the period of the Stolypin
reaction.





[5]
Zavety (Behests)—a legal literary and political
monthly of a Socialist-Revolutionary trend, published in St. Petersburg
from April 1912 to July 1914.





[6]
Trotsky, L. D. (1879-1940)—a bitter enemy of
Leninism. During the years of reaction and the new revolutionary upswing,
he took what was virtually a liquidator stand under the guise of
“non-factionalism”. In 1912 he organised the anti-Party August
bloc. During the First World War he took a centrist stand. Joined the
Bolshevik Party on the eve of the October Socialist Revolution, but
continued his factional activity. In 1918 he opposed the signing of the
Peace of Brest. In 1920–21 he opposed Lenin’s policy on the trade unions
and the trade union movement. In 1923 he led the opposition against the
general line of the Party. The Communist Party denounced Trotskyism as a
petty-bourgeois deviation within the Party and defeated it ideologically
and organisationally. In 1927 Trotsky was expelled from the Party. In 1929
he was deported from the U.S.S.R. for anti-Soviet activity and subsequently
deprived of Soviet citizenship.





[7]
Tyszka, J. (1867–1919)—a prominent leader of the Polish and
German labour movement. During the years of reaction Tyszka denounced the
liquidators, but on a number of occasions took a conciliatory stand towards
them. In 1912 he came out against the decisions of the Prague
Conference. Lenin sharply criticised Tyszka’s activities during that
period. During World War I Tyszka took an Internationalist stand. In 1918
he helped to found the Communist Party of Germany and was elected Secretary
of its Central Committee. He was murdered in a Berlin prison in 1919.

K. Kautsky has realised (at last!) that the Tyszka group of “Tyszka”
and Rosa Luxemburg does not represent the Polish Social-Democratic workers
and that the Warsaw and Lodz organisations have to be reckoned with.  

It is a good thing that he has at last understood facts which have been
known to Russian Marxist workers for years. But the very fact that
for years Rosa L. and Tyszka could pass off a fiction for
reality shows how deplorably misinformed are the German Social-Democrats,
including Kautsky!  

Kautsky reveals still greater ignorance of the subject when he writes
that “as far as he knows” the Polish Socialist Party “Left wing” split
away from the P.S.P. “Right
wing”[2] in order to take a fully Social-Democratic stand.


It is well known—one may say here—that this time Kautsky does
not at all know what he is writing about. Our readers should make
themselves familiar with at least the article by Henryk Kamie&nacuteski
“From Nationalism to Liquidationism” (Prosveshcheniye
No. 10). The author of this article is a Pole and knows What he is
writing about. From this, article our readers will see that the P.S.P. Left
wing is not Social-Democratic at all. Besides, it would be
ridiculous to think that people who desire to take a fully
Social-Democratic stand, and are capable of doing so, would retain
“their own” programme and the title of a non-Social-Democratic party.


The forthcoming “exchange of opinions” among all
Social-Democratic groups in Russia and Poland through the medium of the
Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau will reveal
Kautsky’s error and show that none

 
of the Polish Social-Democrats regard, nor can regard, the P.S.P. Left wing
as a Social-Democratic Party.  

We would add that Kautsky says nothing to repudiate (although he wrote
in
VorwÃ¤rts[3]) the report of his statement made in this very
VorwÃ¤rts that “the old Party has disappeared” in Russia. The
forthcoming “exchange of opinions” will also expose this monstrous
blunder of Kautsky’s.  

 
Notes



[1]
This paragraph is a comment on Kautsky’s letter published in
VorwÃ¤rts, the central organ of the German Social-Democrats,
No. 339, December 24, 1913 (new style), dealing with the report of the
meeting of the International Socialist Bureau and reprinted in Russian in
the newspaper Proletarskaya Pravda, issue No. 12, December 20,
1913 (old style). Kautsky’s letter was a reply to Rosa Luxemburg’s letter
to VorwÃ¤rts.



[2]
 See Note 15.



[3]
VorwÃ¤rts—a daily newspaper, central organ of the German
Social-Democratic Party. In accordance with a decision of the Halle
Congress of the Party, it was published in Berlin from 1891 as a
continuation of the newspaper Berliner Volksblatt issued since
1884 under the name of VorwÃ¤rts. Berliner Volksblatt. F. Engels
used the columns of this paper to combat all manifestations of
opportunism. In the late nineties, after the death of Engels,
VorwÃ¤rts was controlled by the Right wing of the Party and
regularly published articles by opportunists. The paper was tendentious in
reporting the struggle against opportunism and revisionism within the
R.S.D.L.P., and supported the Economists, and subsequently, after the split
in the Party, the Mensheviks. During the years of reaction
VorwÃ¤rts published Trotsky’s slanderous articles, but did not
give Lenin and the Bolsheviks any opportunity to refute them and give an
objective appraisal of the true state of affairs within the Party.  


During World War I VorwÃ¤rts took, a social-chauvinist
stand. After the Great October Socialist Revolution it carried on
anti-Soviet propaganda. Ceased publication in 1933.

As was to be expected, the controversy between the Social-Democrats and
the Cadets on the question of the right of nations to self-determination
has aroused the interest of Novoye Vremya. In issue No. 13563,
this mouthpiece of Great-Russian nationalism writes: 


   “What to Social-Democrats is an axiom of political
   wisdom [i. e., recognition of the right of nations to self-determination,
   to secession], is today beginning to cause disagreement even among the
   Cadets.”  


Despite this Black-Hundred dig at the liberals (the word “even”),
Novoye Vremya is compelled to quote the Rech statement
that “the Cadets have never undertaken to defend the right of nations to
secede from the Russian state”.  

This statement is so forthright that Novoye Vremya is
compelled to prevaricate. It writes: 


   “Judging by the facts, the loose concept of cultural
   self-determination evidently differs, from the Cadets’ point of view, from
   the advocacy of separatism, only in its mode of operation.”  


But Novoye Vremya understands perfectly well the difference
between the absurd “cultural”, and real, i. e., political,
self-determination, for further on we read: 


   “Indeed, the Cadets have never pledged themselves to
   advocate the right of nations to secede from the Russian state ... except
   by the immeasurably more polished method of accepting subsidies for their
   press organs from non-Russians and Jews.”  


The old, crude and ridiculous Black-Hundred device of taunting the
liberals for receiving assistance from the Jews! But we must not allow
these silly little tricks to obscure the main thing: and the main thing is
that Novoye Vremya,

    

in admitting that the Cadets have never undertaken to defend the right
to secede, has come to fully realise the difference between the
Social-Democrats and the Cadets.  

The difference between the Constitutional-Democrats and the
Social-Democrats is the distinction between national-liberals and
consistent democrats.

Mr. Martov has confirmed the fact already noted in
Proletarskaya Pravda that I was not a member of the Strike
Subcommittee, and that on the committee I
opposed the clause concerning “criminal
     liability”.[1]

I need now only add that I advocated not only “mitigation” of penalties,
as Mr. Martov “remembers”, but of course the complete deletion
of such a clause. There was no need for me to move any amendments, because
the draft then under discussion did not contain any such clause,
and it was Mr. F. Dan who unsuccessfully tried to introduce it (even
L. Martov found the courage to oppose Mr. F. Dan on that occasion).

This is the battle-cry of the class-conscious American
workers. They say: We have only one political question be fore us, and that
is the question of the workers’ earnings and their working day.  

To Russian workers it may at first sight seem very strange and puzzling
to have all social and political questions reduced to a single one. But in
the United States of America, the most advanced country in the world, which
has almost complete political liberty, where democratic institutions are
most developed, and where tremendous progress has been made in labour
productivity, it is quite natural that the question of socialism should
come to the fore.  

Thanks to the existence of complete political liberty, it is possible
in America, better than in any other country, to calculate the total
production of wealth and draw up a statistical report of production. That
calculation, based on reliable data, shows that in America there are, in
round numbers, 15,000,000 working-class families.  

Together, these working-class families annually produce consumers’
goods to the value of sixty thousand million rubles. This works out at
4,000 rubles a year per working-class family.  

But at present, under the capitalist social system, only half this vast
amount of wealth, only thirty thousand millions, goes to the workers, who
constitute nine-tenths of the population. The other half is pocketed by the
capitalists, who, with all their apologists and hangers-on, constitute only
one-tenth of the population.  
 

In America, as in other countries, unemployment is rife and the cost of
living is steadily rising. Want among the workers is becoming more and more
distressful and intolerable. American statistics show that about
half the workers are working part time. And what an immense
amount of social labour is still being wasted owing to the preservation of
senseless, backward and scattered small production, particularly in
agriculture and in commerce!  

Thanks to complete political liberty and the absence of feudal
landlords in America, machinery is employed there on a wider scale than
anywhere else in the world. The aggregate power of the machines employed in
the manufacturing industry alone amounts to eighteen million steam
h.p. At the same time, an investigation of all power resources in the form
of waterfalls showed?  according to the report of March 14, 1912, that by
converting the power of waterfalls into electricity America could
immediately obtain an additional sixty million h.p.!  

Already a land of boundless wealth, it can at one stroke
treble its wealth, treble the productivity of its social
labour, and thereby guarantee to all working-class families a
decent standard of living worthy of intelligent human beings, and a not
excessively long working day of six hours.  

But owing to the capitalist social system we see in most of the big
cities of America—and in the rural districts too for that
matter—appalling unemployment and poverty, a wanton waste of human labour
side by side with the unprecedented luxury of the multimillionaires, of the
rich, whose fortunes run into thousands of millions.  

The American working class is rapidly becoming enlightened, and is
organising in a powerful proletarian party. Sympathy for this party is
growing among all the working people. Working with the aid of first-class
machines, and seeing at every turn marvels of engineering and the
magnificent successes of labour resulting from the organisation of
large-scale production, the wage-slaves of America are beginning clearly to
realise what their tasks are, and are advancing the plain, obvious and
immediate demands for an income of four thousand rubles a year for every
working-class family, and a six-hour day.  
 

The aim of the American workers is quite attainable in any civilised
country in the world; but to achieve it, the country must enjoy the
fundamental conditions of freedom....  

And there is no road to a free future other than by way of an
independent working-class organisation, educational, industrial,
co-operative and political.

The liberals differ from the reactionaries in that they
recognise the right to have instruction conducted in the native language,
at least in the elementary schools. But they are completely at one
with the reactionaries on the point that a compulsory official language is
necessary.  

What does a compulsory official language mean? In practice, it means
that the language of the Great Russians, who are a minority of the
population of Russia, is imposed upon all the rest of the population of
Russia. In every school the teaching of the official language must be
obligatory. All official correspondence must be conducted in the
official language, not in the language of the local population.  

On what grounds do the parties who advocate a compulsory official
language justify its necessity?  

The “arguments” of the Black Hundreds are curt, of course. They say:
All non-Russians should be ruled with a rod of iron to keep them from
“getting out of hand”. Russia must be indivisible, and all the peoples
must submit to Great-Russian rule, for it was the Great Russians who built
up and united the land of Russia. Hence, the language of the ruling class
must be the compulsory official language. The Purishkeviches would not mind
having the “local lingoes” banned altogether; although they are spoken by
about 60 per cent of Russia’s total population.  

The attitude of the liberals is much more “cultured” and
“refined”. They are for permitting the use of the native languages within
certain limits (for example, in the elementary schools). At the same time
they advocate an obligatory official language, which, they say, is
necessary in the interests of “culture”, in the interests of a “united”
and “indivisible” Russia, and so forth.  
 


   “Statehood is the affirmation of cultural unity.... An
   official language is an essential constituent of state
   culture.... Statehood is based on unity of authority, the official language
   being an instrument of that unity. The official language possesses the same
   compulsory and universally coercive power as all other forms of
   statehood....  

   “If Russia is to remain united and indivisible, we must
   firmly insist on the political expediency of the Russian literary
   language.”  


This is the typical philosophy of a liberal on the necessity of an
official language.  

We have quoted the above passage from an article by Mr. S. Patrashkin
in the liberal newspaper
Dyen[1] (No. 7). For quite understandable reasons, the
Black-Hundred Novoye Vremya rewarded the author of these ideas
with a resounding kiss. Mr. Patrashkin expresses “very sound ideas”,
Menshikov’s newspaper stated (No. 13588). Another paper the Black Hundreds
are constantly praising for such very “sound” ideas is the
national-liberal Russkaya
Mysl.[2] And how can they help praising them when the liberals,
with the aid of “cultured” arguments, are advocating things that please
the Novoye Vremya people so much?  

Russian is a great and mighty language, the liberals tell us. Don’t you
want everybody who lives in the border regions of Russia to know this great
and mighty language? Don’t you see that the Russian language will enrich
the literature of the non-Russians, put great treasures of culture within
their reach, and so forth?  

That is all true, gentlemen, we say in reply to the liberals. We know
better than you do that the language of Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dobrolyubov and
Chernyshevsky is a great and mighty one. We desire more than you do that
the closest possible intercourse and fraternal unity should be established
between the oppressed classes of all the nations that inhabit Russia,
without any discrimination. And we, of course, are in favour of every
inhabitant of Russia having the opportunity to learn the great Russian
language.  

What we do not want is the element of coercion. We do not want
to have people driven into paradise with a cudgel; for no matter how many
fine phrases about “culture” you may utter, a compulsory
official language involves coercion, the use of the cudgel. We do not think
that the great and mighty Russian language needs anyone having to study it
by sheer compulsion. We are convinced that the development

    

of capitalism in Russia, and the whole course of social life in general,
are tending to bring all nations closer together. Hundreds of thousands of
people are moving from one end of Russia to another; the different national
populations are intermingling; exclusiveness and national conservatism must
disappear. People whose conditions of life and work make it necessary for
them to know the Russian language will learn it without being forced to do
so. But coercion (the cudgel) will have only one result: it will hinder the
great and mighty Russian language from spreading to other national groups,
and, most important of all, it will sharpen antagonism, cause friction in a
million new forms, increase resentment, mutual misunderstanding, and so on.


Who wants that sort of thing? Not the Russian people, not the Russian
democrats. They do not recognise national oppression in any form,
even in “the interests of Russian culture and statehood”.  

That is why Russian Marxists say that there must be no
compulsory official language, that the population must be provided with
schools where teaching will be carried on in all the local languages, that
a fundamental law must be introduced in the constitution declaring invalid
all privileges of any one nation and all violations of the rights of
national minorities.

At your personal request I am writing the following brief
report (bref rapport) in my own name, and apologise in advance for
any gaps in this report (rapport), as I am hard pressed for
time. The Central Committee of our Party will probably find occasion to
send its own official
report[1]

to the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau, and to
correct any possible errors in my own private report.  

What are the differences (dissentiments) between the Central
Committee of our Party and the Organizing Committee? That is the
question. These differences may be reduced to the following six points:

I

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was formed in 1898 as an
illegal Party, and has always remained such. Today too
our Party can exist only as an illegal Party, since in Russia even the
party of the moderate liberals has not been legalised.  

Until the 1905 Revolution in Russia, however, the liberals published an
illegal organ
abroad.[2] When the revolution was defeated, the liberals turned their
backs upon it and indignantly rejected the idea of an illegal press. And so
after the revolution the idea arose in the opportunist wing of our Party of
renouncing the illegal Party, of liquidating it (hence the name
“liquidators”) and of substituting for it a legal
(“open”) party.  

On two occasions, in 1908 and in 1910, our entire Party condemned
liquidationism[3] formally and unqualifiedly. On

    

this point the differences are absolutely irreconcilable. It is impossible
to restore and build up an illegal Party with people who do not believe in
it and have no desire at all to build it up.  

The Organising Committee and the Conference of
August 1912[4] which elected it, recognise the illegal Party in
word. In deed, however, after the decisions of the August
Conference, the liquidators’ newspaper in Russia (Luch and
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta in 1912–13), continued to
attack, in the legal press, the very existence of the illegal
Party (numerous articles by L.S., F.D., Zasulich, and others).  

Thus, we disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter is a
fiction, which in word denies that it is liquidationist, but in fact
screens and whitewashes the liquidators’ group in Russia.  

We disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter is
unwilling (and unable, for it is helpless against the liquidators’ group)
to condemn liquidationism emphatically and irrevocably.  

We cannot build up an illegal Party except by fighting those who attack
it in the legal press. In Russia there are now (since 1912) two
St. Petersburg workers’ dailies: one fulfils and carries out the decisions
of the illegal Party (Pravda). The other (Luch and
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta) attacks the illegal Party, defies it, and
tries to convince the workers that it is unnecessary. Unity between the
illegal Party and the group that is fighting against the existence of the
illegal Party is impossible until the paper run by the liquidators’ group
radically changes its line, or until the Organising Committee emphatically
condemns it and breaks with it.  
II

Our differences with the liquidators are the same as those between
reformists and revolutionaries everywhere. However, these differences are
greatly aggravated and made irreconcilable by the fact that the
liquidators, in the legal press, fight against revolutionary slogans. Unity
is impossible with a group which, for example, declares in the legal press
that the slogan of a republic, or of the confiscation of

    

the big landed estates, is unsuitable for agitation among the masses. In
the legal press we cannot refute such propaganda, which is objectively
tantamount to betraying socialism and making concessions to liberalism and
the monarchy.  

And the Russian monarchy is such that a few more revolutions will be
needed to teach the Russian tsars constitutionalism.  

There can be no unity between our illegal Party, which secretly
organises revolutionary strikes and demonstrations, and the group of
publicists who in the legal press call the strike movement a “strike
craze”.  
III

We disagree on the national question. This question is a very acute one
in Russia. The programme of our Party emphatically rejects so-called
“extra-territorial and national autonomy”. Advocacy of the latter
actually amounts to the preaching of refined bourgeois
nationalism. Nevertheless, the August Conference of the liquidators (1912)
recognised this “extra-territorial national autonomy” thereby
deliberately violating the Party Programme. Comrade Plekhanov, who takes a
neutral stand between the Central Committee and the Organising Committee,
protested against this violation of the Programme, describing it as
adaptation of socialism to nationalism.  

We disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter refuses to
rescind a decision which violates our Party Programme.  
IV

Furthermore, we disagree on the national question in respect of
organisation. The Copenhagen Congress definitely condemned the division of
trade unions according to
nationality.[5] Moreover, the experience of Austria has shown that in
this respect it is impossible to draw a distinction between the trade
unions and the political party of the proletariat.  

Our Party has always stood for a united, international organisation of
the Social-Democratic Party. In 1908, before the split, the Party repeated
its demand for the amalgamation

    

of all the national Social-Democratic organisations in the local areas.


We disagree with the Bund, the separate Jewish workers’ organisation,
which supports the Organising Committee, because, despite Party decisions,
the Bund flatly refuses to proclaim the principle at the unity of all
national organisations in the local areas, and to bring about such an
amalgamation.  

It must be emphasised that the Bund refuses to amalgamate not only with
organisations subordinated to our Central Committee, but also with the
Lettish Social-Democratic Party, the Polish Social-Democratic Party and the
Polish Socialist Party (the Left wing). Consequently, when the Bund poses
as an amalgamator, we reject its claim, and declare that it is the Bund
that is splitting the movement, since it refuses to bring about
international unity among the Social-Democratic workers in the local
organisations.  
V

We disagree with the step taken by the Organising Committee in
defending the alliance of the liquidators and the Bund with a
non-Social-Democratic party, the P.S.P. (the Left wing), despite
the protests of the two sections of the Polish Social-Democratic Party.


The Polish Social-Democratic Party has been affiliated to our Party
ever since 1906–07.  

The P.S.P. (the Left wing) was never affiliated with our
Party.  

By entering into an alliance with the P.S.P. in opposition to
the two sections of the Polish Social-Democratic Party the Organising
Committee is guilty of scandalous splitting action.  

By accepting in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma the
non-Social-Democrat Jagiello, a member of the P.S.P., despite formal
protests by the two sections of the Polish Social-Democratic Party, the
Organising Committee and its supporters among the deputies in the Duma are
guilty of scandalous splitting action.  

We disagree with the Organising Committee because the latter is
unwilling to condemn and annul this splitting alliance with the P.S.P. (the
Left wing).  
    

VI

Lastly, we disagree with the Organising Committee, and with many of the
groups and fictitious organisations abroad, because our opponents are
unwilling to admit openly, loyally and unequivocally that our Party enjoys
the support of the overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers of
Russia.  

We attach extremely great importance to this because, on the basis of
bald statements unsupported by precise and verifiable facts, the most
glaring falsehoods are often circulated abroad about the state of affairs
in Russia.  

The alternative is clear: either our opponents admit that there are
irreconcilable differences between us (in which case their talk about unity
is hypocrisy), or they see no irreconcilable differences (in which case, if
they do not want to be regarded as splitters, they must loyally admit that
we are the absolute majority).  

By what public and verifiable facts can it be proved which
side enjoys the support of the real majority of the class-conscious and
organised Social-Democratic workers in Russia?  

First, by the Duma elections.  

Secondly, by the information published in both Social Democratic
newspapers during the whole of 1912 and nearly the whole of 1913.  

It can be readily understood that the only convincing material on the
question at issue is provided by the daily newspapers of the two trends in
St. Petersburg for two years.  

Thirdly; by public statements made by workers in Russia (in the columns
of both newspapers) in favour of one or the other of the two
Social-Democratic groups in the Duma.  

All these three sets of facts were given in our Central Committee’s
official report to the International Socialist Bureau (session of
December 14, 1913). I will briefly recapitulate these facts.  

First: 47 per cent of the deputies elected by the worker curia in the
elections to the Second Duma (1907), 50 per cent of such deputies in the
elections to the Third Duma (1907–12), and 67 per cent in the elections to
the Fourth Duma were Bolsheviks (i. e., our adherents).  
    


    


 

Secondly, during 21 months between January 1, 1912 and October 1, 1913,
the two workers’ newspapers in St. Petersburg published reports of the
funds collected by workers’ groups: 556 groups collected funds for the
liquidators and all their allies, while 2,181 groups collected
funds for our Party.  

Thirdly, up to November 20, 1913, 4,850 workers expressed support,
over their signatures; for our group in the Duma, as against 2,539
workers who expressed support for the liquidators (and all their allies,
the Bund, the Caucasians, and so on and so forth).  

These precise and verifiable facts prove that during the two years, we
united the overwhelming majority of Social-Democratic workers’
groups in Russia, despite the incredible difficulties the illegal Party in
Russia has to contend with.  

(In the matter of publishing illegal literature and organising illegal,
strictly Party conferences, the odds in our favour are even greater.)  

Since we have in two years united the overwhelming majority of
Social-Democratic workers’ groups in Russia, we claim recognition for our
method of organisation. We cannot depart from that method.  

Those who recognise the illegal Party, but refuse to recognise our
method of organisation, which has been endorsed by two years’ of experience
and by the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers, are guilty
of splitting tactics.  

Such is my brief report.  

With Social-Democratic greetings, N. Lenin
 Brussels, January 31–February 1, 1914

[2]
Lenin is referring to Osvobozhdeniye (Emancipation),
the fortnightly journal of the bourgeois liberals, published abroad from
1902 to 1905 and edited by P. B. Struve. In January 1904 it became the
organ of the liberal-monarchist Osvobozhdeniye League. Later the
Osvobozhdeniye people formed the core of the Cadet Party.





[3]
Lenin is referring to the decisions of the All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P. (the Fifth Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.) and the January Plenum
of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1910.  

The Fifth All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in
Paris on December 21–27, 1908 (January 3–9, 1909). It was attend ed by 16
voting delegates: 5 Bolsheviks, 3 Mensheviks, 5 Polish Social-Democrats and
3 Bundists. The Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. was represented by
Lenin, who made a report at the Conference on “The Present Moment and the
Tasks of the Party”, as well as speeches on the Social-Democratic group in
the Duma, on the organisational and other questions. At this Conference the
Bolsheviks waged a struggle against the two types of opportunism within the
Party—the liquidators and the otzovists. On a motion by Lenin the
Conference denounced liquidationism and called upon all Party organisations
to fight resolutely against any attempts to liquidate the Party.  

For an appraisal of the Conference’s decisions see Lenin’s articles
“On the Road” and “The Liquidation of Liquidationism”. (See present
edition, Vol. 15, pp. 345–55, 452–60.)  

The Plenum of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. was held on January
2--23 (January 15–February 5), 1910 in Paris. It was convened despite
Lenin, with the help of Trotsky’s secret allies—Zinoviev, Kamenev and
Rykov. Besides the Bolsheviks, it was attended by representatives of all
sections and groups, as well as by representatives of the national
Social-Democratic organisations. In opposition to Lenin’s plan of a
rapprochement with the pro-Party

   

Mensheviks (the Plekhanovites) for the purpose of fighting liquidationism,
the conciliators, secret Trotskyists, demanded that all groups should be
dissolved and that tile Bolsheviks should unite with the liquidators and
Trotskyists. The conciliators preponderated at the meeting and were able to
get a number of anti Leninist decisions adopted. Only after Lenin’s
insistent demands did the Plenum adopt a resolution condemning
liquidationism and otzovism.

See Note 34.





[5]
The Copenhagen Congress of the Second International was held on August
28–September 3 (new style), 1910. Following the discussion of the
Czech-Austrian split, the Congress declared against the
“Bundist-nationalist” principles of the Czech separatists.

The Penza
Zemstvo[1] is conducting a valuation and statistical investigation on
the basis of a programme so full and detailed that it must arouse
exceptional interest in every student of Russia’s economic system.  

A complete census is being taken of all peasant households
according to an abbreviated household card. In addition, every
third household is described according to a more detailed brief
household card; every ninth household is described in a still fuller
household card, called the detailed card; every
twenty-seventh household is described in a still fuller household
card, called the special card; and, lastly, twenty-five households
in the uyezd (probably representing about one-thousandth of the total
households) gave their budgets in still greater detail.  

In all, we have five degrees of more or less detailed
investigation, and the fuller programme contains all the questions that are
included in the abbreviated programme. In the preface, the authors indicate
the degree of fullness of each of these five descriptions in the
following manner: 


   “The budget covers the entire production and consumption
   of the peasant household.  

   “The special description studies, in each household, the
   sale and purchase of agricultural produce and the turnover of
   stock-breeding (on a special form), and all the questions contained in the
   detailed household card.  
 

   “The detailed household card lists all the properties,
   undertakings and occupations of the members of the household, registers the
   sex, age and literacy of the members of the family and the value of
   livestock, dead stock and buildings, and records the incomes from
   undertakings and occupations and crops, and expenditure on hiring labour.
   

   “The brief household card contains only data on the sex,
   age and literacy of the members of the family, and lists their properties,
   undertakings and occupations, livestock and dead stock.  

   “The abbreviated household card registers the size of
   the family divided according to sex, the number of male workers, the
   properties and undertakings of the family, except rented land, the
   principal livestock, the literacy and outside occupations of the male
   workers, and also the number of boys and girls attending school.”  


It is to be regretted that the volume contains no appendix with a full
list of the questions contained in all the five types of descriptions. Only
the briefest (“abbreviated”) household card is appended, and this gives
(approximately) a no less detailed description of the households than is
given in the cards used in agricultural censuses organised on European
lines.  

It may be said without exaggeration that if the Penza statisticians
investigate the whole gubernia according to the above programme the data
they will collect will be almost ideal. Let us assume that there are
270,000 households in the gubernia (actually the figure is probably
higher). This will give us 90,000 descriptions containing data on the
amount of land rented, and on all the live and dead stock; it will also
give us 30,000 descriptions containing data on the crops (of each
household), on expenditure on hired labour, and value of farm
implements and buildings. It will give us a further 10,000 descriptions of
the sale and purchase of agricultural produce as well as the “turnover of
stock-breeding” (i. e., probably a precise description of the conditions
under which livestock is kept and fed, the productivity of stock-breeding,
etc.). And lastly, it will give us two hundred and fifty budgets
which, counting ten typical groups of peasant households, will give
exhaustive descriptions of each group based on
twenty-five budgets per group, i.e., quite sufficient to obtain steady
averages.  

In short, if this programme is fulfilled, peasant husbandry in the
Penza Gubernia will have been studied magnificently, and far better than in
West-European censuses (which, it is true, cover the whole country, not a
gubernia).  
 

The whole point is, how these excellent data will be
tabulated. That is the main difficulty. Herein lies the weakest
spot of our Zemstvo statistics, which as far as thoroughness and care for
detail are concerned, are splendid. The data on each of the 300,000
households (or each of the 90,000, 30,000 or 10,000) may be splendid, but
if they are not properly tabulated they will be utterly useless for
scientific purposes, for an understanding of Russia’s economics, inasmuch
as general averages per village commune, volost, uyezd or gubernia, tell us
very little.  

It is precisely at the present time that semi-medieval (patriarchal and
feudal) agriculture in Russia is undergoing a process of capitalist
transformation. This process started over half a century ago. During this
long period of time, a vast amount of miscellaneous information on
the various features of this process has been collected in Russian economic
literature. The important thing now is that this mass of Zemstvo
statistics, so admirable in details, thoroughness and authenticity, should
be properly tabulated. These statistics must be tabulated in such
a way as to provide an answer, a precise and objective answer,
based on mass data, to all the questions indicated or
outlined in the course of over half a century’s analysis of the post-Reform
economics of Russia (and at the present time the Stolypin agrarian
legislation poses a great number of new and extremely interesting questions
concerning Russia’s post-revolutionary economics).  

The statistical returns must be tabulated in such a way as to make
it possible to study from them the process by which the old, feudal,
natural economy, based on the corvée and labour service, is being
destroyed and superseded by commercial, capitalist economy. No person in
Russia at all familiar with politics and economics can now doubt that this
process is going on. The only question is how to tabulate these
excel lent house-to-house data so as to prevent them from being
wasted, and to facilitate the study of all aspects of this
extremely complex and varied process.  

To meet these requirements, the tabulation of the house-to-house
statistics should yield the greatest number of group and complex
tables drawn up in the most rational and detailed manner, so that
all the types of households that have

    

been noted—or evidence of which have been noted (this is no less
important)—may be studied separately. Without varied and rationally
compiled group and complex tables, this wealth of house-to-house statistics
will simply be wasted. That is the greatest weakness of present-day
statistics, which of late have been suffering increasingly from what I
would call “statistical cretinism”—an inability to see the wood for the
trees; economic types of phenomena are sub merged in a welter of
figures, types that can be brought out only in varied and
rationally compiled group and complex tables.  

To be called rationally compiled, such tables must first of
all enable one to trace the process of development of capitalism in all its
ramifications and forms. Only such a tabulation can be regarded as rational
as will bring into focus the best preserved types of natural economy and
the various degrees to which it is being superseded by commercial and
capitalist agriculture (in different areas commercial agriculture assumes
different forms, drawing first one and then another branch of agriculture
into the process of production for the market). The various types of
economy that are in the process of transition from exclusively natural
agriculture to the sale of labour-power (what we call
“industries”, which consist in the sale of labour-power) and also to the
purchase of labour-power, should be dealt with separately in
special detail. So also must the various types of households according to
their level of wealth (degree of accumulation of capital, and of
opportunity of forming and accumulating it), and according to size
of aggregate agricultural production, and the size of those branches of
agricultural production which in the given locality and at the given time
lend themselves most easily to transformation into commercial
agriculture or commercial stock-breeding, and so on and so forth.


This transformation of natural economy into commercial
agriculture is the crux of the matter in a study of the modern economics of
agriculture. The endless errors and prejudices of official,
liberal-professorial, petty-bourgeois Narodnik and opportunist “theory”,
are due to failure to understand this transformation or to inability to
trace it in its extremely varied forms.  
 

Judging from the volume mentioned above, the work of the Penza
statisticians is being performed by people who do not go about the job in
bureaucratic fashion, but are really interested in their subject and
capable of producing scientific research of immense value. Nevertheless
this work seems to be suffering from an excess of statistical red tape or
statistical zeal and from a lack of politico-economic common sense and
purpose.  

The volume under review contains, first of all, reference material on
the villages. This material takes up a little less than one-tenth of the
book. The other nine-tenths consist of tables drawn up according to village
communes. Each group of peasants (according to size of holdings) in each
commune in each village is given a separate horizontal line (there are
altogether 1,009 for the whole uyezd) containing 139 columns. The
information is given in remarkable detail. Nine-tenths of this information
will probably never be required for any kind of reference even by the most
inquisitive of the local inhabitants.  

But remarkable detail verges on something like statistical mania when
we see columns 119–139, i.e., twenty-one columns, giving the
relative numbers, i. e., the percentages, for each of the thousand
uyezd divisions!  The statisticians have made thousands and tens of
thousands of calculations for a single uyezd, which even the local
inhabitants may need only in highly exceptional cases. The statisticians
have made about 15,000 to 20,000 calculations, of which probably
only a dozen or two will be needed by local inhabitants
alone, who could have made these calculations themselves
on the rare occasions they required them.  

The vast labour wasted by the statisticians detracts from the amount of
work they are able (with the available personnel and the available
budget—the Zemstvo budgets provide very modest funds for statistics!) to
devote to investigation. The volume under review contains thousands of
figures constituting an unnecessary statistical “luxury”, but it does
not contain a single summary. All summaries have been
left for subsequent volumes. In the first place, we are not sure that other
volumes will appear, nor can the Russian Zemstvo statisticians, who are too
dependent on police tyranny, be sure of this, And secondly, without a

    

test being made of the various group and complex tables according
to uyezd, it is never possible to obtain a full and scientifically
satisfactory system of summarised, group and complex tables according to
gubernia.  

So far we have a deplorable fact—a volume of Zemstvo statistics of
negligible, almost negatory scientific value, on which an immense amount of
labour has been wasted, and which contains a wealth of valuable and
up-to-date data (the result of the law of November 9!) that have
not been summarised, collated, grouped, or combined.  

We shall mention at least some of the groups that could and should have
been established in order to render this wealth of Zemstvo statistics
serviceable. The uyezd and the gubernia should be divided into districts
showing where commercial agriculture of the various types is most prevalent
(the distilling of liquor from grain and potatoes; the sale of dairy
products; butter and oil making; special commercial crops, and so on, and
so forth); then according to the prevalence of on-agricultural and
migratory industries; conditions of landlord economy (the nearness of
landed estates, or the absence of same; the predominance of serf-like
corvée, labour service, métayage, share-cropping, and so
forth, or of capitalist, landlord farming employing hired labour); also the
degree to which commerce and capitalist turnover in general are developed
(an extremely important division which must positively be made as an
elementary requirement of political economy, and which can easily be made,
although that is usually not done: that is to say, to group villages
according to their distance from railways, market-places, trade centres,
and so forth); according to size of village (in the Krasnoslobodsk Uyezd
there are about 30,000 house holds distributed over 278 villages, but 19 of
the largest villages have a total of 9,000 households; in all probability
the conditions vary).  

It is desirable and necessary to group households not only according to
the size of their holdings but also according to the crop area (in their
preface the compilers say that peasant farming in Penza Gubernia is
conducted “mainly on the peasants’ own land and not on rented land”; but
this statement is too sweeping, and the question of renting land is of vast
importance and should be elaborated in detail);

    

likewise, according to the area under commercial crops, wherever and
whenever they are to be observed and can be itemised; further, according to
“industries” (but not in the crude way that this is usually done, as if
in mockery of political economy, by taking “households with members en
gaged in industries” and those without such members; it is absolutely
necessary to indicate the status of the person in the industry: households
in which a large, medium, or small number of the members go out to work as
hired labourers; households which own small or large establishments
employing a small, medium or large number of wage-workers, and so forth),
and according to the number of livestock owned (this has partly been done
in this volume), etc.  

Complex tables, ten of them, say, with the households divided (again
approximately) into ten groups according to the various indications of
capitalism’s penetration into agriculture, would give—assuming that we
have 80 columns—8,000 new calculations, i. e., would take up much less
space than the 20,000 worthless calculations of percentages for each
separate village commune.  

The scientific value of such varied complex tables which show the great
diversity of forms in which agriculture and the agriculturalist are
subordinated to the market, would be tremendous. It may be said without
exaggeration that they would revolutionise the science of agricultural
economics.

This extremely useful book briefly catalogues the material on labour
protection exhibited at the All-Russia Hygiene Exhibition. It contains a
vast amount of valuable statistical data on a number of questions affecting
the lives of the workers, such as the number of workers employed in various
industries, female and child labour, the working day and wages, sanitary
conditions and labour protection, sickness and mortality among the workers,
alcoholism, workers’ insurance, and so on and so forth.  

Appended is an excellent index to the literature on labour protection.


The absence, in many cases, of absolute figures (only percentages are
given) is a shortcoming of the book, as is the absence of a general
subject index that would enable the reader quickly to find the
data he needed on different questions.  

It would be desirable to have these faults eliminated in subsequent
editions. All who are interested in the labour question, and all trade
unions, insurance and other working-class organisations, will undoubtedly
avail themselves of this book. Subsequent editions can and should make this
book a systematic catalogue of material on questions concerning the
conditions and protection of labour in Russia.

The boycott, or rather the frothy radical chatter that is
increasingly becoming the sole content of liquidator writings, often
obscures from the reader the principles underlying liquidator
propaganda. That is exactly what the liberal-labour politicians are
after—that amidst the din, hullabaloo, and fireworks of radical claptrap
the workers should more easily swallow bourgeois platitudes
against the Marxist organisation.  

But class-conscious workers will not be deceived by the rantings of
sham “political campaigns” launched by the disruptors of the workers’
organisation. What class-conscious workers appreciate most of all and first
of all in every press organ is adherence to high principle. What are the
workers really being taught under cover of the “opposition” claptrap,
clamour and claims to defend the interests of the workers?—that is the
main, the basic and, properly speaking, the only important question that
every thinking worker asks himself. The thinking worker knows that the most
dangerous of advisers are those liberal friends of the workers who claim to
be defending their interests, but are actually trying to destroy the class
independence of the proletariat and its organisation.  

It is therefore our bounden duty to open the workers’ eyes to the
manner in which the liquidators are destroying the organisation. Take, for
example, the programmatic leading article in the New Year’s issue of the
liquidators’ organ. We are told: 


   “The working class is heading towards a political party
   of the proletariat, which will function openly and be sufficiently powerful
   and broad to resist the efforts of any political regime to deprive it of
   all rights, to deprive it of the possibility of fulfilling its normal
   functions of political leadership.”  

 

There you have an example of “normal” liberal claptrap in
all its glory! No sensible liberal would refuse to raise both hands in
favour of this splendid formula, by means of which the liquidator newspaper
tries to conceal the fact that it is “heading” and striving
towards the destruction of everything the proletariat has during the last
twenty years achieved in the way of Marxist organisation, at the cost of so
much effort.  

Further on it is still more candid: 


   “The road to the open political party of action is also
   the road to Party unity.”  


It has been stated thousands and thousands of times, in the most formal
and most solemn declarations, stated as far back as 1908 and 1910, that
this kind of talk is tantamount to renouncing, to liquidating, the
past. But the liquidators, nothing daunted, go on harping on the same theme
in the hope of deceiving some terribly ignorant people with their outcries
about “unity”.  

Traitors to the entire Marxist past clamouring about an “open
party”—and “unity”!... Why, this is an insult to the class-conscious
workers. It is an insult even to the “August” Conference of 1912, at
which a handful of naive people believed that the liquidators had abandoned
the shameful liberal slogan of an open party.  

But the whole point is that this gang of liberal hacks, all those
F.D.’s, Gammas, L.M.’s, Em-El’s,
Rakitins,[1] etc., etc., are waging their liberal campaign to
destroy the Marxist organisation, deliberately flouting the resolutions of
both 1908 and 1910, and trying to deceive the non-class-conscious
workers. They think there are still ignorant people about, who will believe
their promises of an “open party” and fail to see (hat this is simply a
variety of the liberal campaign against the existence of the genuine
Marxist organisation! And whilst there are ignorant people about, this
handful of liberal hacks, who seek to liquidate the past, will continue
their dirty work, no matter how many times they are told that “unity”
with these disruptors and disorganisers is an absurdity and a fraud.  

The New Year “leaderist” of the liquidator newspaper does not stand
alone. He is backed by all the liquidators,

    

Mr. P. Karpov, for example, who, in issue No. 5 (123) of Novaya
Rabochaya Gazeta, assures us that 


   “overcoming [all the obstacles that are put in the way
   of organising workers’ congresses] is nothing more nor less than a genuine
   struggle for freedom of association, i. e., for the legalisation of the
   working-class movement, which is closely linked with the struggle for the
   open existence of the workers’ Social-Democratic Party”.  


No liberal or even Octobrist will deny sympathy with the struggle for
the legalisation of the working-class movement! No liberal will utter a
sound of protest against an “open party”; he will even support those who
advocate it as his best accomplices in fooling the workers.  

In fulfilment of our duty, we shall never tire of repeating to the
class-conscious workers that advocacy of an open workers’ party is empty
liberal chatter, designed to corrupt the workers and to destroy the Marxist
organisation. The latter cannot exist and grow unless a determined
and relent less struggle is waged against those who are directing all their
efforts towards destroying the Marxist organism, into which the upsurge of
the last two years has infused new and healthy blood.

In his letter, published in Novaya Rabochaya
Gazeta No. 16, A. Bogdanov concealed the main reason for his
disagreement with Pravda.  

That reason is that A. Bogdanov has for many years been opposing the
philosophy of Marxism and upholding bourgeois idealist views against the
materialism of Marx and Engels.  

For that reason, the Marxist Bolsheviks several years ago considered it
their duty to come out against Bogdanov. For the same reason the Marxist
Mensheviks, in the person of G. V. Plekhanov, are conducting a literary
struggle against Bogdanov. And lastly, for the very same reason, even the
so-called Vperyod
group[2] has broken with Bogdanov.  

True, ever since Bogdanov began to contribute to Pravda, we
doubted whether he would refrain from carrying his fight against the
philosophy of Marxism into the columns of the workers’
newspaper. Unfortunately, A. Bogdanov hastened to confirm our fears. After
getting several small popular articles on innocuous subjects, published in
Pravda, he shortly submitted an article entitled “Ideology”, in
which, in the moat “popular” manner, he launched an attack upon the
philosophy of Marxism. The editors refused to publish that anti-Marxist
article. This was the cause of the conflict.  

We advise A. Bogdanov, instead of complaining about “family rows” to
get that article entitled “Ideology” published (the
liquidationist newspaper will not, of course, refuse hospitality to an
anti-Marxist article). All Marxists will then be able to see the real
reason for our disagreement with Bogdanov, concerning which he said not
a word in his lengthy letter.  
 

We believe that the workers have set up a newspaper of their own in order
that it should advocate Marxism, and not have its columns used to
distort Marxism in the spirit of bourgeois “scholars”.  

We are also very glad that A. Bogdanov has once again raised the
question of the article on the Vperyod group, which he sent to
Pravda last summer. Since A. Bogdanov desires it, he will receive
(in Prosveshcheniye) a detailed statement about the number of
untruths that article contained, and about the immense harm that
adventurist group has caused the working-class movement in
       Russia.[1]

The Vperyod group—an anti-Party group including otzovists,
ultimatumists, god-builders, and empirio-monists (adherents of the
reactionary, idealistic philosophy of Mach and Avenarius), organised abroad
in December 1909 and headed by A. Bogdanov and G. Alexinsky. It had several
small circles, consisting mostly of intellectuals, in Paris, Geneva and
Tiflis. In Lenin’s words, the views of the Vperyod group were “a
caricature of Bolshevism”. With no support among the workers, the group
fell apart in 1913. For further details about this group see pp.487–93 of
this volume.

Every crisis, every turning-point in any movement, is
particularly interesting (and particularly useful to those who belong to
it) in that it brings into clear and sharp focus that movement’s
fundamental trends, its fundamental laws.  

The International Socialist Bureau’s decision to arrange an “exchange
of opinions” among all groups in Russia’s working-class movement also
marks a certain crisis or turning-point in the movement. It will
undoubtedly be very useful “loyally”, as the resolution of the
International Socialist Bureau expresses it, i.e., sincerely, to “exchange
opinions” before an authoritative international body. It will make
everybody take a closer and more serious look at the
course of the working-class movement in Russia.  

We ought to be extremely grateful to Mr. F. D., the well-known leader
of the liquidators, for having of his own accord published in
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 108 an extremely valuable statement of
his views on “amalgamation”, covered with only a thin veil of convention
and bashfulness. Our best greetings to Mr. F.D.! It is pleasanter by far to
talk with the opponent himself than with muddled or feeble
go-betweens, etc.!  

With praiseworthy candour Mr. F.D. sets forth and compares two
points of view on amalgamation: one of them he rejects as “profoundly
erroneous”; the other he approves of and adheres to.  

This is how Mr. F. D. sets forth the first point of view: 


   “One may argue thus: the differences among the
   Social-Democratic trends in Russia are negligible. Therefore, on the
   grounds of their negligibility, we must, with help from the International,
   devise

    

   some organisational form of amalgamation—either federation, or a
   certain quota restricting the powers of any majority. Once an accept able
   external form of ‘unity’ is found, the negligible differences will
   ‘vanish’ of themselves—everything will come right in the end.”  


Mr. F. D. calls this point of view “profoundly erroneous”, without,
however, naming its advocates (Trotsky, Kautsky, and all the
“conciliators” in general). The veil of convention and bashfulness must
have prevented Mr. F. D. from mentioning the well-known names of the
supporters of this “profoundly erroneous” idea! But actually
concealment of the truth benefits only the opponents of the working class!


Thus, the views of the conciliators are “profoundly erroneous”. Why
is that?  

In answering this question Mr. F. D. winds the veil thrice round his
bashful face. “It will explode,” he says, “it will lead to collapse”,
“be the differences great or small!”  

The words quoted in italics give Mr. F.D. away completely. Murder will
out, however you “veil” it.  

With the full candour you reveal, Mr. F. D., your petty evasions are
useless and ridiculous. Are the differences negligible, or are
they not negligible? Give us a straight answer. There is no middle
course, for the point at issue is whether unity is possible
(yes, it is possible if the differences are negligible, or small)
or impossible (no, it is impossible if the differences are
not “negligible”).  

In condemning the “negligible” differences, Mr. F.D. admitted
thereby that the disagreements are important. But he was afraid to
say so openly (what would the
“Seven”[1] say? What would Trotsky, the Bundists,
An,[2] and all the conciliators say?). He tried to Wrap his answer in a
long-winded and deadly dull discourse on the second point of view
on unity.  

But even in this long-winded discourse it is not difficult to get to
the heart of the matter: 


   “This platform [i. e., the one that Mr. F. D. considers
   desirable and acceptable] must ensure the non-Leninists full opportunity,
   with in the united Social-Democratic Party, to campaign and fight for the
   open existence of Social-Democracy.”  


Enough! Quite enough, Mr. F. D.! This is the real gist of the matter,
not phrases or declamations.  
 

To ensure the liquidators full opportunity to fight the
“underground”—that is what Mr. F. D.’s “platform” amounts to, since
everybody understands perfectly well that the fig-leaf of a “fight for
open existence” is intended to cover up the fight against the
“underground”, which all workers know is being waged.  

That is the crux of the matter, and all those Trotskys, Ans, Bundists,
conciliators, “Sevens”, and so forth, are nice people, but political
nonentities. The heart of the matter is in Mr. F.D.’s group, the “old”
group of liquidators.  

The Marxist organisation’s differences with this group are absolutely
irreconcilable, for agreement (let alone unity), not only with those who
repudiate the “underground”, but even with those who have any doubts on
that score, is totally out of the question. The workers have long realised
that this is the crux of the matter as far as the liquidators are
concerned, for they dismissed the latter from office in
all fields of the working-class movement.  

There was a time when the Marxist organisation condemned the
liquidators (1908–09). That time has long passed away. There was a time
when the Marxist organisation proclaimed forgiveness and peace to all who
were prepared to renounce liquidationism (1910–11). That time has long ago
passed away. There was a time when the Marxists re-established their
organisation, in opposition to the liquidators (1912–13). That
time, too, has passed away. Then came a time when the Marxist organisation
won over the overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers,
in opposition to all and sundry liquidators together with their
allies.  

This has been proved by incontrovertible facts. The proportion of
Bolshevik deputies elected by the worker curia rose from 47 per cent in the
Second Duma elections to 50 per cent in the Third Duma elections, and to 67
per cent in the Fourth Duma elections (autumn 1912). In the course of 21
months, between January 1, 1912 and October 1, 1913, the Party rallied
two thousand workers’ groups, while the liquidators and
all their allies united only five hundred. Not only have
Mr. F.D. and his friends made no attempt to refute these incontrovertible
facts, but they them selves, speaking through Mr. Rakitin in the
columns of Nasha
    

=

Zarya,[3] have admitted that the masses of the workers
support the Bolsheviks.  

Clearly, anyone who offers the Marxist organisation a “platform”
giving the liquidators “every opportunity” to liquidate that
organisation—anyone who, “in the name of unity”, flouts the will of the
vast majority of the class-conscious workers, is simply making a mockery of
“unity”.  

Do you want unity? Then renounce liquidationism unequivocally, renounce
the “fight for open existence”, and submit loyally to the majority. You
do not want unity? You may please yourself, but do not complain if, in a
few months’ time, you will have no worker following left at all, and you
will have become not “near-Party” but “near-Cadet” intellectuals.

In Austria the national programme of the Social-Democratic
Party was discussed and adopted at the Br\"unn Congress in 1899. There is a
very widespread but mistaken opinion that this Congress adopted what is
known as “cultural-national autonomy”. The reverse is true: the latter
was unanimously rejected there.  

The South-Slav Social-Democrats submitted to the Br\"unn Congress (see
p. XV of the official Minutes of the Congress in German) a programme of
cultural-national autonomy worded as follows: 


   (§2) “every nation inhabiting Austria,
   irrespective of the territory on which its members reside, shall
   constitute an autonomous group, which shall quite independently administer
   all its national (language and cultural) affairs”.  


The words underlined by us clearly express the gist of
“cultural-national autonomy” (otherwise called extra-territorial). The
state is to perpetuate the delimitation of nations in educational and
similar affairs, and every citizen is free to register with any nation he
pleases.  

At the Congress this programme was defended both by Kristan and the
influential Ellenbogen. It was later with drawn,however. Not a single vote
was cast for it. Victor Adler, the Party’s leader, said, “...I doubt
whether anybody would at present consider this plan practicable” (p. 82 of
the Minutes).  

One of the arguments against it, on principle, was advanced by
Preussler, who said: “The proposals tabled by comrades Kristan and
Ellenbogen would result in chauvinism being perpetuated and introduced into
every tiny community, into every tiny group” (ibid., p. 92).  
 

Clause 3 of the Br\"unn Congress programme relevant to this subject
reads as follows: 


   “The self-governing regions of a given nation
   shall form a single national association which shall settle all its
   national affairs quite autonomously.”  


This is a territorialist programme which directly
precludes, for example, Jewish cultural-national
autonomy. Otto Bauer, the principal theoretician of “cultural-national
autonomy”, devoted a special chapter of his book (1907) to
proving that “cultural-national autonomy” for the Jews could not be
demanded.  

We would mention on this issue that Marxists stand for full freedom of
association, including the association of any national regions (uyezds,
volosts, villages, and so forth); but Social-Democrats cannot possibly
agree to having statutory recognition given to single national
associations within the state.  

In Russia, as it happens, all the Jewish bourgeois parties (as
well as the Bund, which actually follows in their wake) adopted
the programme of “extra-territorial (cultural-national) autonomy”, which
was rejected by all the Austrian theoreticians and by the Congress of the
Austrian Social-Democratic Party!  

This fact, which the Bundists for quite obvious reasons have often
tried to deny, can be easily verified by a reference to the well-known
book, Forms of the National Movement (St. Petersburg, 1910)—see
also Prosveshcheniye No. 3, 1913.  

This fact clearly shows that the more backward and more petty-bourgeois
social structure of Russia has resulted in some of the Marxists becoming
much more infected with bourgeois nationalism.  

The Bund’s nationalist vacillations were formally and unequivocally
condemned long ago by the Second (1903) Congress, which flatly
rejected the amendment moved by the Bundist Goldblatt on “the setting
up of institutions guaranteeing freedom of development for the
nationalities” (a pseudonym for “cultural-national autonomy”).  

When, at the August 1912 Conference of liquidators, the Caucasian
Mensheviks, who until then had for decades

    

been strenuously fighting the Bund, themselves slipped into nationalism,
under the influence of the entire nationalist atmosphere of the
counter-revolution, the Bolsheviks were not the only ones to
condemn them. The Caucasian Mensheviks were also emphatically condemned by
the Menshevik Plekhanov, who described their decision as “the adaptation
of socialism to nationalism”.  


   “The Caucasian comrades,” Plekhanov wrote, “who have
   begun to talk about cultural autonomy instead of political autonomy, have
   merely certified the fact that they have unwisely submitted to the hegemony
   of the Bund.”  


Besides the Jewish bourgeois parties, the Bund and the liquidators,
“cultural-national autonomy” was adopted only by the conference of the
petty-bourgeois national parties of the Left-Narodnik trend. But even here
four parties (the Jewish Socialist Labour Party; the Byelorussian Hromada;
the Dashnaktsutyun and the Georgian
Socialists-Federalists[2]), adopted this
programme, while the two largest parties abstained from voting:
these were the Russian Left Narodniks and the Polish “Fracy” (P.S.P.)!


The Russian Left Narodniks expressed particular opposition to the
compulsory, legal-state associations of nationalities proposed in
the famous Bund plan.  

From this brief historical survey it is clear why both the February and
the summer conferences of Marxists in 1913 emphatically condemned the
petty-bourgeois and nationalist idea of “cultural-national
     autonomy”.[1]

The reference is to Byelorussian Socialist Hromada—a
nationalist organisation which came into being in 1902 under the name of

   

“Byelorussian Revolutionary Hromada”. It defended the interests of the
Byelorussian bourgeoisie, landlords and kulaks, denied the revolutionary
class struggle, and tried to keep the Byelorussian people away from the
Russian revolutionary working class. These attempts met with no support
among the working masses of the Byelorussian people. In the national
question, the Hromada stood for “cultural-national autonomy”. After the
February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917 the Hromada supported the
policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government. Following the October
Socialist Revolution it split up into three counter-revolutionary groups
who joined the whiteguards and foreign interventionists in an active
struggle against the Soviets.  

Dashnaktsutyun—a bourgeois-nationalist party founded in the
early nineties of the nineteenth century in Turkish Armenia with the aim of
liberating the Armenians from the Turkish yoke. The party was a
bourgeois-democratic conglomerate of representatives of various
classes. Alongside the bourgeoisie, a prominent place in it was occupied by
the national intelligentsia, as well as by peasants and workers unaffected
by Social-Democratic propaganda, and part of the lumpenproletariat forming
the zinvors squads.  

On the eve of the 1905–07 Revolution this party transferred its
activities to the Caucasus and aligned itself with the
Socialist-Revolutionaries. The party’s Left wing formed the Young
Dashnaktsutyun group, which joined the S. R. Party in 1907.  

The activities of the Dashnaktsutyun were of an anti-popular
nature. Its nationalist propaganda was greatly detrimental to the
internationalist education of the proletariat and the masses of Armenia and
the entire Transcaucasia.  

After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917, the
Dashnaks supported the policy of the bourgeois Provisional
Government. After the October Socialist Revolution they entered into a
counter-revolutionary bloc with the Mensheviks, S. R.s and Musavatists
against the Bolsheviks. In 1918–20 the Dashnaks stood at the head of the
bourgeois-nationalist counter-revolutionary government of Armenia. Their
action was designed to convert Armenia into a colony of the foreign
imperialists and a stronghold of the Anglo-French interventionists and
Russian whiteguards in their struggle against the Soviet government. Under
the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and with the help of the Red Army,
the working people of Armenia overthrew the Dashnak government in
November 1920. With the victory of the Soviets, the Dashnaktsutyun
organisations in Transcaucasia were smashed and liquidated.  

Georgian Socialists-Federalists—a bourgeois-nationalist
party founded in April 1904. Demanded national autonomy for Georgia within
the framework of the Russian bourgeois-landlord state. During the period of
reaction, the Socialists-Federalists became open opponents of the
revolution. In concert with the Mensheviks and anarchists, this party tried
to smash the united international front of the working people of
Transcaucasia against tsarism and

   

capitalism. After the Great October Socialist Revolution the S. F.s,
together with the Georgian Mensheviks, the Dashnaks and Musavatists,
organised a counter-revolutionary bloc, which was supported by the
Germano-Turkish, and later, by the Anglo-French interventionists.

Deafened by liberal catch-phrases, people in our country
are apt to overlook the actual class stand of the liberal party’s real
bosses. In Russkaya Mysl No. 12, Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoi has
splendidly revealed this stand and strikingly shown to what extent liberal
landlords like the Trubetskois, and reactionary landlords like the
Purishkeviches have drawn closer together on all important issues.  

Stolypin’s agrarian
policy[1] is one such momentous issue. The highborn liberal landlord has
this to say of it: 


   “Ever since Stolypin became Premier, the government’s
   entire concern for the countryside has been prompted largely by two
   motives: fear of
   Pugachovism,[2] which caused so much trouble in 1905, and the desire to
   offset it with a new type of peasant—one who is well-to-do and therefore
   cherishes private property, one who will not be susceptible to
   revolutionary propaganda....”  


By the very use of the word “Pugachovism” our liberal reveals that he
is at one with the Purishkeviches. The only difference is that the
Purishkeviches utter this word ferociously and menacingly, whereas the
Trubetskois pronounce it in the dulcet and sugary Manilov
manner,[3] to the accompaniment of phrases about culture, disgustingly
hypocritical exclamations about the “new peasant communities” and the
“democratisation of the countryside”, and pathetic speeches on things
divine.  

Owing to the new agrarian policy, the peasant bourgeoisie is growing
much faster than before. There is no question about that. The peasant
bourgeoisie in Russia cannot help growing whatever the political and
agrarian system may be, because Russia is a capitalist country which has
been completely drawn into the orbit of world capitalism. His

    

Liberal Highness would have known this had he possessed at least an
elementary knowledge of the “fundamental principles of Marxism”, of which
he speaks with such boundless aplomb and with equally boundless
ignorance. But His Highness exerts every effort to obscure the fundamental
question of what the development of capitalism is like without any
Purishkeviches, and what it is like with their class in complete
power. His Highness goes into ecstasies over the progress of co-operation,
fodder grass cultivation, and “growing prosperity”; but he does not say a
word about the high cost of living, the mass pauperisation of the peasants,
their desperate poverty and starvation, about labour rent, and so
forth. His Highness sees that the “peasants are turning bourgeois”, and
goes into raptures over it, but our liberal landlord turns a blind eye to
the fact that they are becoming wage-labourers under conditions in which
the relations of feudal bondage are preserved.  


   “The intelligentsia’s first contact with the broad
   masses of the peasantry,” he writes, “took place as far back as 1905, but
   at that time it bore an altogether different character; it was destructive
   rather than constructive. At that time the affiliation was established
   solely for the purpose of destroying the old forms of life, and was
   therefore superficial. The demagogue intellectual did not imbue the
   peasants’ minds and peasant life with his own independent ideas; if
   anything, he himself was guided by the instincts of the masses of the
   people. He flattered them and adapted his party programme and tactics to
   them.”  


Familiar Purishkevich-style talk! A little example: if eighty peasant
homesteads of twenty-five dessiatines each are set up on 2,000 dessiatines
of the Trubetskois’ land, that will be “destructive”; but if a score or
so of such homesteads are set up on the land of the pauperised
village-commune peasants, that will be “constructive”. Is that not so,
Your Highness? Don’t you realise that in the first in stance, Russia would
really be “bourgeois-democratic”, and in the second she would remain
Purishkevichian for decades to come?  

However, shying away from unpleasant questions, the highborn liberal
assures his readers that the big landowners, who are selling their land,
will “soon, very soon” disappear entirely.  
 


   “If, by its measures, the government does not accelerate
   the future revolution excessively, ‘compulsory alienation’ will no longer
   be a problem when that revolution does come, as there will be almost
   nothing left to alienate.”  


According to the latest statistics of the Ministry of the
Interior,[4] 30,000 landlords owned 70,000,000 dessiatines of land in
1905, while a similar area was owned by 10,000,000 peasants. But that does
not concern the highborn liberal in the least! He assures his readers that
the Purishkeviches will disappear very “soon”, because he wishes to
defend the Purishkeviches. The only thing that really interests him is
that: 


   “there will be in the countryside enough people
   interested in private property to counter, not only Pugachov propaganda,
   but socialist propaganda in all its forms”.  


Thanks for being so candid!  


   “What will the result be?” the liberal prince
   asks. “Will the government, with the aid of the intelligentsia [who are
   joining co-operative societies, etc.], re-educate the peasants to become
   loyal petty landed proprietors, or, on the contrary, will the
   intelligentsia educate them wit h the aid of government loans?”  


The prince anticipates neither of these alternatives. But that is
merely a hypocritical turn of speech. Actually, as we have seen, he stands
heart and soul for peasants being re-educated to become “loyal petty
landed proprietors”, and assures us that “the intelligentsia is coming
down to earth”, and that there will be no room for the “demagogic
agrarian programme” of the socialists (which, in the opinion of His
Highness, runs counter to the “fundamental principles of Marxism”. Don’t
laugh, reader!).  

That a landlord should entertain such views is not surprising, Neither
is his indignation at the growth of atheism surprising, or his pious
speeches. What is surprising is that there are still foolish people in
Russia who do not understand that while such landlords and such politicians
set the tone in the liberal party, including the Cadet Party, it is
ridiculous to hope that the people’s interests can be really defended
“with the co-operation” of the liberals and the Cadets.  

 

Notes

Stolypin’s agrarian policy aimed at using the kulaks as a
bulwark of the regime in the countryside. The tsarist government issued a
Ukase on November 9(22), 1906 regulating the peasants’ withdrawal from the
communes and the establishment of their proprietary rights on the allotment
lands. After its approval, with slight modifications by the Duma and the
Council of State, this Ukase became known as the Law of June 14,
1910. Under this Stolypin law (which got its name from P. A. Stolypin,
Chairman of the Council of Ministers) the peasant was free to withdraw from
the village commune, take possession of his allotment on a proprietorship
basis, and sell it. The rural community was obliged to give the peasants
who withdrew from the commune an allotment of land in one place (an
otrub, homestead). The Stolypin reform speeded up the development
of capitalism in the country side and the process of differentiation among
the peasantry, and sharpened the class struggle in the village.  

The Stolypin reform is characterised and evaluated in a number of works
by Lenin, notably in his The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in
the First Russian Revolution, 1905–1907. (See present edition,
Vol. 13, pp. 217 -429.)

The tenth anniversary of the death of the liberal-Narodnik
writer Mikhailovsky has provided the Narodniks with a pretext for reviving
the old dispute about the significance of the Marxists’ struggle against
the Narodniks. That dispute is of no little interest:first, historically,
since the rise of Marxism in Russia was the point at issue; second,
theoretically, since the dispute concerned the fundamental questions of
Marxist theory; and third, practically, inasmuch as the
Left-Narodnik newspaper in St. Petersburg is trying to win the workers over
to its side. Mr. Rakitnikov, the Narodnik, writes: 


   “Nobody, of course, now puts the case the way it was put
   in the sixties and seventies, viz., whether Russia can avoid the phase of
   capitalism. Russia is already in that phase.”  


This interesting statement by a Left Narodnik brings us straightaway to
the gist of the matter. Is it true that the question as to whether “Russia
can avoid the phase of capitalism” was discussed only in the sixties and
seventies? No. It is absolutely untrue. This question was discussed by the
Narodniks in general, and by the contributors to Russkoye
Bogatstvo[1] (i. e., members of Mikhailovsky’s group) in
particular, both in the eighties and the nineties. It is sufficient to
mention Mr.
Nikolai —on,[2] for example.  

Why then, did Mr. Rakitnikov conceal the eighties and the
nineties from his readers? Was it merely to cover up the Narodniks’ errors,
and thus help to spread them among the workers? This is a shabby trick, and
things must be going bad with those who resort to such tricks.  
 

What are the implications of the theory that “Russia can avoid the
phase of capitalism”, a theory that was propounded by Mikhailovsky and his
group, and survived right down to the nineties of the last century?  

That was the theory of utopian, petty-bourgeois socialism, i. e., the
dream of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, who sought a way of escape
from capitalism not in the wage-workers’ class struggle against
the bourgeoisie, but in appeals to the “entire nation”, to
“society”, that is, to that very same bourgeoisie.  

Prior to the rise of the working-class movement, such theories of
“socialism” were prevalent in all countries and they merely reflected. in
fact the hopes of petty-bourgeois theoreticians that the class struggle
could be avoided, dispensed with. In all countries, as in Russia, the
class-conscious working-class movement had to wage a persistent struggle
against these petty-bourgeois doctrines of “socialism” which were in
keeping with the status and point of view of the petty proprietors.  

The working-class movement cannot exist or develop successfully until
this theory of the benevolent petty proprietors regarding the possibility
of “avoiding” capitalism is refuted. By covering up the fundamental
mistake of the Mikhailovsky group, Mr. Rakitnikov is bringing confusion
into the theory of the class struggle. Nevertheless it is this
theory alone that has shown the workers the way out of their present
conditions, shown how the workers themselves can and should endeavour to
achieve their emancipation.  

“Russia is already in the phase of capitalism,” writes
Mr. Rakitnikov.  

This remarkable admission is tantamount to admitting the fundamental
error of Mikhailovsky and his group.  

Moreover, it is tantamount to a complete renunciation of Narodism.


The Left Narodniks who are in agreement with this ad mission are now
fighting the Marxists not as Narodniks, but as opportunists in the
socialist movement, as supporters of petty-bourgeois deviations from
socialism.  

Indeed, if “Russia is already in the phase of capitalism”, it follows
that Russia is a capitalist country. It follows that

    

in Russia, as in all capitalist countries, the petty proprietors,
including the peasants, are petty bourgeois. It follows that in Russia, as
in all capitalist countries, the wage-workers’ class struggle against the
bourgeoisie is the only way in which socialism can be achieved.  

To this day the programme of the Left Narodniks (not to mention their
Russkoye Bogatstvo friends) dares nut admit that Russia is a
capitalist country. Mr. Rakitnikov defends Narodism by
surrendering the Narodniks’ programme to the Marxists! A poor
defence!  

Mr. Rakitnikov argues with the Marxists not like a Narodnik but like an
opportunist when he says: 


   “to support peasant farming does not mean battling
   against the stream of inexorable economic development. And an
   increasing number of socialists in the West is adopting this point of
   view.”  


We have emphasised the words that completely betray our poor “Left
Narodnik”! We know that in the West the class of wage-workers
alone has been able as a class to form socialist parties. We know
that in the West the peasantry as a class forms, not socialist hut
bourgeois parties. We know that it is not the socialists, but the
opportunists in the West who support petty-bourgeois farming.  

“To support peasant farming!...” Look about you. Peasant
proprietors are forming associations to market grain, hay, milk
and meat at the highest prices, and to hire labour at the lowest. The freer
the peasants are and the more land they possess, the clearer do we see
this.  

Mr. Rakitnikov is trying to persuade the class of wage-workers to
“support petty-bourgeois farming”. A fine sort of “socialism”, indeed!


The wage-workers support only the peasants’ struggle against the
feudalists and the serf-like conditions, but that is quite different from
what Mr. Rakitnikov wants.  

In Russia, the great years of 1905–07 definitely proved that the
wage-workers were the only class to act and tally as a socialist force. The
peasantry acted and rallied as a bourgeois-democratic force. With the
development of capitalism the difference between the classes becomes more
marked from day to day.  
 

“Left-Narodnik” propaganda amounts, in effect, to the corruption and
disruption of the wage-workers’ class movement with the aid of
petty-bourgeois slogans. The Left Narodniks would be well advised to turn
to democratic work among the peasants—that is something which even
non-socialists can do.

“In our day”, when attempts are being made to stage another Beilis
case, the nationalists’ propaganda could bear more frequent scrutiny. The
nature of this propaganda was revealed with striking clarity at the recent
second congress of representatives of the “All-Russia National
Association”.  

It would be highly erroneous to think that the significance of this
propaganda is negligible inasmuch as this entire “All-Russia
Association”, which was represented only by 21 delegates from all over
Russia, is negligible and fictitious, a mere shadow. The “All-Russia
National Association” is insignificant and a shadow, but its propaganda is
backed by all the parties of the right and by all the official
institutions; its propaganda is conducted in every village school, in every
military barrack, and in every church.  

The following is a press report of a paper read at this congress on
February 2.  


   “Savenko, a member of the Duma, read a paper on
   ‘Mazeppism’,[1] as the Ukrainian movement is called in the jargon of the
   nationalists. Savenko expressed the opinion that the separatist tendencies
   [i. e., for secession from the state] among the Byelorussians and the
   Ukrainians were particularly dangerous. The Ukrainian movement constituted
   a specially great and real menace to the integrity of Russia. The immediate
   programme of the Ukrainians was federalism and Ukrainian autonomy.  

   “The Ukrainians linked their hopes of autonomy with the
   defeat of Russia in a future war with Austria-Hungary and Germany. On the
   ruins of Great Russia an autonomous Poland and an autonomous Ukraine would
   be founded under the sceptre of the Habsburgs and
   within the boundaries of Austria-Hungary.  

   “If the Ukrainians really succeeded in tearing their
   30,000,000 away from the Russian people, it would mean the end of the
   Great-Russian Empire. (Applause.)”  


Why is this “federalism” no obstacle to the integrity of the United
States, or of Switzerland? Why is “autonomy”

    

no obstacle to the integrity of Austria-Hungary? Why has “autonomy”
even cemented the ties between Britain and many of her colonies for a long time
to come?


Mr. Savenko has presented his case for “nationalism” in such a
ridiculous light that he has made it extremely easy to refute his ideas. The
integrity of Russia, if you please, is “menaced” by the autonomy of
the Ukraine, whereas the integrity of Austria-Hungary is cemented by
universal suffrage and the autonomy of her various regions! Is not this very
strange? Will it not occur to those who read and hear this
“nationalist” propaganda to ask why it is impossible to
cement the integrity of Russia by granting autonomy to the
Ukraine?


By persecuting “subject peoples”, the landlord and bourgeois
nationalists try to split and corrupt the working class the better to be able to
dope it. The class-conscious workers retaliate by demanding complete equality
and unity for the workers of all nationalities in practice.


In declaring the Byelorussians and Ukrainians to be subject peoples, the
nationalist gentry forget to add that the Great Russians (the only
non-“aliens” in Russia) constitute only 43 per cent of the
population. Hence, the “subject peoples” are in the majority! How
then can the minority keep its hold on the majority if it offers the latter no
benefits, the benefits of political freedom, national equality, and
local and regional autonomy?


By persecuting the Ukrainians and others for their “separatism”,
for their secessionist strivings, the nationalists are upholding the
privilege of the Great-Russian landlords and the Great-Russian
bourgeoisie to have “their own” state. The working class is opposed
to all privileges; that is why it upholds the right of nations
to self-determination.


The class-conscious workers do not advocate secession. They know the
advantages of large states and the amalgamation of large masses of workers. But
large states can be democratic only if there is complete equality among the
nations; that equality implies the right to secede.


The struggle against national oppression and national privileges is inseparably
bound up with the defence of that right.

No phrase has been worked harder among the Narodniks than that about
the Marxists “setting the working people by the ears” by drawing a
line between the hired workers and the peasants and pitting one class against
the other. And no phrase is more mendacious, serving as it does to cover up
defence of the interests of the small proprietor, the petty bourgeois, the
exploiter of the hired labourer.


The following interesting data are from the Moscow Zemstvo Statistics published
in 1913 (A Handbook of Economic Statistics, Vol. VII, Moscow,
1913). The Moscow statisticians investigated fruit and vegetable gardening in
Moscow Uyezd. The investigation covered over 5,000 households, which the
statisticians divided into seven districts according to their proximity to
Moscow and the degree of intensity of cultivation (i. e., expenditure of a
large amount of capital and labour on each dessiatine of land).


The employment of hired labourers by the peasants was investigated in fairly
great detail. What is the result?


In the first four districts the number of households employing labour is 67
per cent (i. e., over two-thirds of the total number of households); in the
remaining districts it ranges from 43 to 64 per cent. Hence it is evident that
the overwhelming majority of the peasant households near Moscow are the farms of
petty capitalists who hire labourers.


Still more interesting are the figures showing the number of households which
employ labourers by the year or season. The percentages of such households are
as follows:






District I . . . . .  
26.6 per cent


” II . . . . .       
16.7 ” ” 


” III . . . . .      
16.4 ” ” 


” IV . . . . .       
19.0 ” ” 


” V . . . . .        
9.9 ” ” 


” VI . . . . .       
5.0 ” ” 


” VII . . . . .      
6.4 ” ” 



 

As a rule, the more intensive a given district, the higher is the
percentage of peasants who employ labourers by the year and the season.


The figures covering entire districts, however, lump together the poor
and the rich peasants in each district. Hence, they are only very rough
figures which give a varnished picture, for they cover up
the contrasts between poverty and wealth, between the proletariat and the
bourgeoisie.  

Let us take the figures for the groups of farms classified according to
amount of land held in tenure (i. e., amount of land under
cultivation). These figures are far more reliable than the figures of
allotment land ownership, which to this day, even around Moscow,
retains its feudal-bureaucratic character. Among the peasants who own small
allotments there are rich peasants who lease land. And among the peas ants
who own large allotments there are poor peasants who rent out their
allotments, and landless or rather non-farming peasants.  

In all districts the percentage of non-farming peasants who employ
labourers is nil. That is natural. The non-farming peasant is himself a
proletarian.  

Peasants with farms of under half a dessiatine: the percentage of
households employing labourers ranges from 0 to 57 (we are taking one of
the three subgroups, so as not to complicate the question).  

Farmers with between one half and one dessiatine: the percentage of
households employing labourers ranges from 0 to 100.  

Farmers with one to three dessiatines: the percentage of households
employing labourers ranges from 46 to 100 (in different districts).  

Farmers with from three to five dessiatines: the percentage of
households employing labourers ranges from 66 to 97.  

Farmers with from five to ten dessiatines: the percentage of households
employing labourers ranges from 75 to 100.  

From this we clearly see that the non-farming peasants are themselves
proletarians (hired labourers). The larger the farm, the more
often is hired labour exploited. Even among the farmers who have from
three to five dessiatines, no less than two-thirds of the total
exploit hired labour!  
 

Such is the plain, well-known and obvious fact which the Narodniks try
to distort. What is true of the Moscow area is true, to a lesser degree, of
all other places. Everyone knows that every town and
every mile of railway draw peasant economy into the orbit of
commerce and capitalism. The “Left Narodniks” are the only ones who
refuse to see the truth, which explodes their petty-bourgeois theory.  

That truth is that every mile of railway, every new
shop that is opened in the village, every co-operative society
that is formed to make buying easier, every factory, and so forth,
draw peasant economy into the orbit of commerce. And that means that the
peasantry is breaking up into proletarians, and
proprietors employing hired labourers.  

There can be no improvement in peasant economy that does not
involve an increase in the exploitation of hired labour on the improved
farms.  

That is why the Marxists defend the interests of labour—and they are
the only ones to do so—by distinguishing the proletarians, the hired
workers, both in town and countryside.  

The Narodniks, on the other hand, defend (in practice) the interests of
the exploiters of hired labour when they talk about the
“peasantry” and “peasant economy”, for the more the peasant resembles a
“proprietor”, the more he exploits hired labour.  

It is in the interests of the bourgeoisie (in whose footsteps the
Narodniks blindly follow) to confuse the peasant proletariat with
the peasant bourgeoisie.  

It is in the interests of the proletariat to combat this confusion and
to draw a clear line between classes everywhere, including the
peasantry. It is useless deceiving oneself and others by talking about the
“peasantry”. We should ourselves learn and teach the peasants that even
among the peasantry the gulf between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is
widening day by day.

Mr. Struve is one of the most outspoken of the counter
revolutionary liberals.  It is often very instructive, there fore, to lend
an ear to the political comments of a writer who is a striking illustration
of the correctness of the Marxian analysis of opportunism (for Mr. Struve,
as we know, began with opportunism, with a “criticism of Marxism”, and in
a few years fell as low as counter-revolutionary, bourgeois
national-liberalism).  

In the January issue of Russkaya Mysl, Mr. Struve discussed
the need “to reform the government”. In the first place, he admits the
failure of the Stolypin
policy,[1] as well as of the entire reaction of 1907–14 and
Octobrism.[2] Reaction “faces a crisis”, writes Mr. Struve. In his
opinion, attempts at back-pedalling reforms, such as turning the Duma into
a legislative-consultative body, will “put the government in the same
position it was in before 1905”, with this important difference, however,
that the people have changed since then. “In 1905 the sympathies and
instincts of the masses swung over to the intelligentsia.”  

This is written by a
Vekhist,[3] a fervent opponent of revolution and an exponent of the most
obscurantist theories. Even he is compelled to admit that the
masses have swung to the left; but this liberal dares not say more
plainly, clearly and exactly which classes among these masses have aligned
themselves with which parties.  


   “Our people has not taken shape yet, has not yet
   separated into its elements. The fact that it has been conservative for
   such a long time and gone revolutionary overnight, as it were, does not
   tell us what it will become when all its latent potentialities will have
   developed.”  

 

This is a specimen of the phrase-mongering with which the bourgeoisie
covers up unpalatable truths. Obviously, what is implied here by
the term people is the peasantry, since the bourgeoisie (let alone the
landlords) and the working class have sufficiently taken shape, and are
sufficiently differentiated. The liberal dares not in so many words admit
that the bourgeois peasantry “has not yet taken shape”,
despite the frantic efforts of the new agrarian policy.  

“What is the way out of the present situation?” Mr. Struve asks, and
replies: “There is only a single alternative: either steadily increasing
political unrest, in which the middle classes and the moderate elements
that represent them... [so the moderate elements “represent” the middle
classes? This is not very intelligent but politically it is fairly clear;
which elements, then, “represent” the peasantry and the workers?] will
again be pushed into the background by the elemental pressure of the
popular masses who will be in spired by the extreme elements, or, the
reform of government. We shall not deal here with the first way
out. Under the conditions prevailing in Russia we definitely adhere to the
point of view that it is impossible for us either to work effectively
towards such a solution, or even simply to desire it....” (Thank you for
being so candid, Mr. Struve!  Our liquidators could well take a lesson in
plain-speaking and candour from this man, instead of beating about the bush
the way L. M. does in the January issue of Nasha Zarya.)  


   “It is left for us to suggest to the public mind the
   second way out as being an urgent problem which has to be solved by the
   joint efforts of all progressive and, at the same time, preservatory
   forces.”  


Of this second way out Mr. Struve has absolutely nothing to say except
empty phrases. The bourgeoisie is for moderation, the masses are for
“extremes”—this the liberal is compelled to admit. As to what the
social structure of the reformable “government” must be, what its class
basis should be, and what has become of the landlords who reigned and
governed unchallenged prior to the bourgeoisie—of all this Mr. Struve
dares not even think. Helplessness, impotence and complete lack of
principles and ideals—such are the inevitable features of the liberal
bourgeoisie so long as it fawns (as Messrs. Struve and Co. do) on the
Purishkeviches.  
 


   “Strange as it may appear,” Mr. Struve writes, “there
   is nothing that we could wish the government more than that it should
   forget that there ever were events, facts and moods which we are accustomed
   to call the Russian revolution.”  


Splendid, profound, wise, and earnest political advice!  Let the
“government forget”. After all, aged people do some times forget what is
happening to them and around them!  

The spokesmen of senile Russian liberalism measure others with their
own yardstick.

Stolypin, P. A. (1862–1911)—an extreme reactionary,

with the suppression of the first Russian revolution (1905–07) and the
ensuing period of harsh political reaction.

Octobrists—members of the “Union of October Seventeenth”
Party formed in Russia after the promulgation of the tsar’s Manifesto of

interests of the big bourgeoisie and landlords who had gone over to
capitalist forms of ownership. Its leaders were the well-known
industrialist and Moscow house-owner A. I. Guchkov, and the big landowner
M. V. Rodzyanko. The Octobrists wholly supported the home and foreign
policies of the tsarist government.

Vekhists—participants of the symposium Vekhi
(Landmarks)—a collection of articles by prominent Cadet
publicists representing the counter-revolutionary liberal bourgeoisie: =

N. A. Berdayev, S. N. Bulgakov, M. 0. Herschensohn, A. S. Izgoyev,
B. A. Kistyakovsky, P. B. Struve and S. L. Frank. Issued in Moscow in the
spring of 1909.  

In articles on the Russian Intelligentsia the Vekhists tried to malign
the revolutionary-democratic traditions of the Russian nation’s finest
sons, among them V. G. Belinsky and N. G. Chernyshevsky. They vilified the
revolutionary movement, of 1905 and thanked the tsarist government for
having saved the bourgeoisie from “the fury of the people with its
bayonets and jails”. The symposium called upon the intelligentsia to serve
the autocracy. Lenin compared the Vekhi programme in philosophy
and journalism with that of the Black-Hundred newspaper Moskovskiye
Vedomosti, and called the symposium “an encyclopaedia of liberal
renegacy” “nothing but a flood of reactionary mud poured on
democracy”. (See present edition, Vol. 16, p. 453.)

The tenth anniversary of the death of N.K. Mikhailovsky
(who died on January 28, 1904) was marked by a spate of laudatory articles
in the liberal-bourgeois and Narodnik (i. e., bourgeois-democratic)
press. It is not surprising that the liberals and bourgeois democrats laud
N. K. Mikhailovsky, but one cannot help protesting against the flagrant
distortion of the truth and the corruption of proletarian
class-consciousness when attempts are made to pass Mikhailovsky off as a
socialist and to prove that his bourgeois philosophy and sociology are
compatible with Marxism.  

Mikhailovsky was one of the finest spokesmen of Russian bourgeois
democracy in the latter third of the last century. The masses of the
peasantry, who (not counting the urban petty bourgeoisie) are the only
important and mass vehicles of bourgeois-democratic ideas in Russia, were
then still dormant. The best people from their midst, and those who deeply
sympathised with their hard lot, the raznochintsi (mostly
students, teachers and other intellectuals), tried to enlighten and rouse
the dormant peasant masses.  

The historic service that Mikhailovsky rendered the
bourgeois-democratic movement for the liberation of Russia was that he
warmly sympathised with the hard lot of the peasants, strenuously combated
all manifestations of feudal tyranny, advocated in the legal, open
press—if only by hints—sympathy and respect for the “underground”,
where the most consistent and determined raznochintsi democrats
operated, and even gave direct personal help to the “underground”. Today,
when not only liberals but also liquidators, both Narodnik (Russkoye
Bogatstvo) and Marxist, betray a shameless and often renegade attitude
towards the

    

“underground”, one cannot help putting in a good word in memory of the
service rendered by Mikhailovsky.  

Though he was an ardent champion of freedom and of the oppressed masses
of the peasantry, Mikhailovsky shared, all the weaknesses of the
bourgeois-democratic movement. He thought there was something
“socialistic” in the idea of transferring all the land to the peasants,
especially without redemption, and therefore considered himself a
“socialist”. Of course, this was a profound error, which was fully
revealed by Marx and by the experience of all civilised countries,
where, until the complete collapse of serf-ownership and absolutism, the
bourgeois democrats constantly imagined themselves to be
“socialists”. The transfer of all the land to the peasants, particularly
on the terms indicated, is a very useful measure under the rule of the
feudal-minded landlords, but it is a bourgeois-democratic measure. Today
every sensible socialist is aware of that. The experience of all the world
goes to show that the more land (and the cheaper) the peas ants have
received from the feudalists, the more “land and liberty” there has been,
the more rapidly capitalism has developed and the more
speedily the bourgeois nature of the peasants has been
revealed. If Mr. N. Rakitnikov (in issue No. 3 of Vernaya
Mysl[1]) has not yet realised that the proletariat’s support of the
bourgeois-democratic peasants against the feudal landlords is not
socialism at all, one can only smile at his simplicity. it is a dull
business refuting errors that have long been refuted by all class-conscious
workers.  

Not only in the field of economics, but also in those of philosophy and
sociology, Mikhailovsky’s views were bourgeois-democratic views
veiled by quasi-socialist phrases. Such were his “progress formula”, his
“struggle for individuality” theory and so on. In philosophy Mikhailovsky
was a step backward from Chernyshevsky, the greatest exponent of
utopian socialism in Russia. Chernyshevsky was a materialist, and to the
end of his days (i. e., until the eighties of the nineteenth century) he
ridiculed the petty concessions to idealism and mysticism that were made by
the then fashionable “positivists” (Kantians, Machists, and so
forth). And Mikhailovsky trailed in the wake of these very positivists. To
this very day, these reactionary philosophical

    

views prevail among Mikhailovsky’s disciples, even among the extreme
“Left” Narodniks (such as Mr. Chernov).  

That the “socialism” of Mikhailovsky and the Narodniks is mere
bourgeois-democratic phrase-mongering was conclusively proved by the
actions of all classes and their mass struggle in 1905–07. Most of the
peasant deputies in the First and Second Dumas sided, not with the
Left Narodniks, but with the
“Trudoviks”[2] and the “Popular
Socialists”.[3] This is a fact that must not be forgotten or
distorted. And, following the Marxists, even the Left Narodniks, in the per
sons for example of Vikhlayev, Chernov, and others, have been compelled to
admit the bourgeois nature of the Trudovik Popular Socialists!  

Let individual workers who sympathise with the Left Narodniks ask their
teachers to produce everything the Left Narodniks wrote
against the Trudovik Popular Socialists in 1906–07.  

In those years mass action by the peasants proved conclusively that the
peasantry takes a bourgeois-democratic stand. The Left Narodniks
are at best only a small wing of peasant (i. e., bourgeois) democracy in
Russia. The workers have supported the peasants (against the feudal
landlords), and will continue to do so, but to confuse these classes, to
confuse bourgeois democracy with the socialist proletariat, is reactionary
adventurism. All class-conscious workers will strenuously combat this,
particularly at the present time when the class cleavage has been made
quite clear by the great experience of the mass struggle of 1905–07, and
is be coming clearer day by day in our rural districts.  

For a very long time, over ten years in fact, Mikhailovsky was the head
and guiding spirit of the Russkoye Bogatstvo publicist group. What
did this group produce in the great days of 1905–07?  

It produced the first liquidators among the democrats! Let individual
workers who sympathise with the Left Narodniks ask their teachers to show
them Russkoye Bogatstvo for August 1906, and all that was written
by the Left Narodniks when they called this group “Social-Cadets”, and so
forth!  

The Mikhailovsky group brought forth the first liquidators who, in the
autumn of 1906, proclaimed an “open party”,

    

and renounced the “underground” and its slogans two or three years before
our Marxist liquidators did so. What came of the “open party” proclaimed
by the Myakotins, Peshekhonovs, and other associates of Mikhailovsky?
Nothing—the complete absence of any party whatsoever, and the complete
isolation of the “open” group of opportunist Narodniks from the masses.


Mikhailovsky, who never renounced the “underground” (or rather, died
shortly before his group went over to liquidationism), should not be held
fully responsible for the paltry and contemptible opportunism of
Messrs. Peshekhonov, Myakotin and Co. But is it not characteristic that in
issue No. 3 of Vernaya Mysl, which is dedicated to Mikhailovsky,
we again find the corrupt bloc between the “Left” Narodniks and the
“Social-Cadets” of Russkoye Bogatstvo? And if we recall what
Mikhailovsky wrote to Lavrov about his attitude towards revolutionaries
shall we not have to admit that, on the whole, the “Social-Cadets” are
his faithful successors?  

We pay tribute to Mikhailovsky for the sincere and skilful struggle he
waged against the serf-owning system, the “bureaucracy” (we beg to be
excused for this loose term), and so forth, for his respect for the
“underground” and the assistance he rendered it, but not for his
bourgeois-democratic views, or his vacillating tendencies towards
liberalism, or his “Social-Cadet” group of Russkoye Bogatstvo.


It is no accident that the bourgeois democrats in Russia, i. e., in the
first place the peasantry, vacillate between the liberal bourgeoisie and
the proletariat; that is due to their class position. It is the workers’
job to liberate the peasantry from the influence of the liberals and
relentlessly to combat “Narodnik” doctrines.

[2]
Trudoviks (the Trudovik group)—a group of petty-bourgeois
democrats in the Russian Duma consisting of peasants and intellectuals of a
Narodnik trend. The Trudovik group was formed in April 1906 of peasant
deputies to the First Duma.  

The Trudoviks demanded abolition of all social-estate and national
restrictions, democratisation of rural and urban self-government, and
universal franchise in Duma elections. Their

   

agrarian programme was based on the Narodnik principles of “equalised”
land tenure, all the state, crown, and church lands being united in a
national land fund, inclusive of all privately owned lands whose size
exceeded the established labour norm; the owners of lands thus alienated
were to receive compensation. Lenin pointed out in 1906 that the typical
Trudovik was a peasant who “is not averse to a compromise with the
monarchy, to settling down quietly on his own plot of land under
the bourgeois system; but at the present time his main efforts are
concentrated on the fight against the landlords for land, on the fight
against the feudal state and for democracy.” (See present edition,
Vol. 11, p. 229.)  

In the Duma the Trudoviks vacillated between the Cadets and the
Social-Democrats. This vacillation was conditioned by the very class nature
of the petty proprietors—the peasants. Since the Trudoviks to a certain
extent represented the peasant masses, the Bolsheviks in the Duma pursued
the tactic of agreement with them on various issues for joint struggle
against tsarism and the Cadets. In 1917 the Trudovik group merged with the
“Popular Socialist” Party and actively supported the bourgeois
Provisional Government. After the October Socialist Revolution the
Trudoviks sided with the bourgeois counter-revolution.





[3]
Popular Socialists—a petty-bourgeois party formed in 1906
from the breakaway Right wing of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Their
political views were close to those of the Cadets. After the February
Revolution of 1917 the P. S.s supported the bourgeois Provisional
Government, and after the October Socialist Revolution they joined forces
with the counter-revolution to fight the Soviets.

The editors have received a letter signed by thirteen
“Left Bolsheviks” and bearing the address “Tiflis, Caucasus”, asking
for our opinion on the question of having A. Bogdanov as a contributor. The
signatories call themselves “ideological adherents of the Vperyod
group”, and their tone is openly and definitely hostile to our newspaper.


Nevertheless, we consider it necessary to have it out with them once
and for all.  

Why has it become impossible to have A. Bogdanov as a contributor to
workers’ newspapers and journals that adhere to a stand of consistent
Marxism? Because A. Bogdanov is not a Marxist.  

The writers of the letter, following the cue given by Bogdanov himself
in his letter to the liquidator newspaper, try to account for A. Bogdanov’s
disappearance from the columns of our newspapers on personal grounds, as
being due to personal spite, and so forth. All this is sheer nonsense that
is not worth going into or explaining. Everything is much simpler and
plainer.  

If the writers of the letter were interested, not in “personalities”,
but in the history of the organisational and ideological relations among
the Marxists, they would know that as far back as May 1909 a delegate
meeting of Bolsheviks, after a long and detailed preliminary discussion,
rejected all responsibility for A. Bogdanov’s literary-political
utterances.[2] If the writers of the letter attached less importance to
philistine scandal and gossip and paid more attention to the ideological
struggle among the Marxists, they would know that in his books A. Bogdanov
has built up a definite social and philosophical system and that
all Marxists, irrespective of group allegiance, have expressed
their opposition to this

    

system as being non-Marxist and anti-Marxist. All who are interested in the
history of Marxism and the working-class movement in Russia know—and
those who do not should make it their business to learn, read and
find out—that the question of A. Bogdanov’s contributions to a workers’
newspaper is bound up with a much more important question of principle,
namely, the relation between Marxist philosophy and Bogdanov’s
theories. This question has been discussed, examined, and worked to death
in books, pamphlets and articles. The question of a writer’s contributions
to the workers’ press should be approached from the political angle, i. e.,
not from the point of view of the writer’s style, wit, or popularising
talent, but from that of his general trend, from the point of view of what
he is bringing into the working masses by his theories. The Marxists are
convinced that the sum of A. Bogdanov’s literary activities amounts to
attempts to instil into the consciousness of the proletariat the touched-up
idealistic conceptions of the bourgeois philosophers.  

If anybody thinks that this is not the case and that, in the
controversy over the philosophical principles of Marxism, it is not
Plekhanov and not
Ilyin,[3] but Bogdanov who is right, that person should come out in
support of Bogdanov’s system, and not argue that one popular article or
another of Bogdanov’s ought to be given space in the columns of a workers’
newspaper. But we know of no supporters of Bogdanov’s system among
Marxists. His theories have been opposed, not only by his “factional”
opponents, but also by his former colleagues in his political group.  

That is how the matter stands with Bogdanov. His attempts to “modify”
and “correct” Marxism have been examined by Marxists and recognised as
alien to the spirit of the modern working-class movement. The groups he
formerly co-operated with have rejected all responsibility for his literary
and other activities. One can think whatever one pleases about Bogdanov
after this, but to demand that he be given space in the columns of the
workers’ press, which is called upon to disseminate the elementary
principles of Marxism, reveals a failure to understand either Marxism,
Bogdanov’s theories, or the task of spreading Marxist education among the
masses of the workers.  
 

As regards the business of educating the masses of the workers, to
which our newspaper is dedicated, our path and Bogdanov’s diverge, for we
differ in our understanding of what that education should be. That is the
real issue, which, for self-interested motives, is being obscured by hints
about personal relations. Workers to whom the trend of their news
paper is dear should brush aside as trash all these attempts to reduce the
issue to the “personalities” of certain writers; they must look into the
character of Bogdanov’s theories. When they begin to do so they will
speedily reach the conclusion we have arrived at, namely, that Marxism is
one thing, and Bogdanov’s theories are quite another. A workers’ newspaper
should clear the minds of the proletariat of bourgeois, idealistic
hodge-podge, not offer them this indigestible fare in their columns.  

We may be told: Nevertheless, Pravda did publish several of
Bogdanov’s articles. So it did.  

But, as everyone now can see, this was a mistake inevitable in such a
new undertaking as the publication of the first workers’ newspaper in
Russia. The comrades who were in charge at the time had hoped that, in the
popular articles which Bogdanov offered the newspaper, propaganda of the
ABC of Marxism would overshadow these specific features of Bogdanov’s
theories. As might have been expected, things turned out differently. After
the first articles, which were more or less neutral, Bogdanov sent in an
article in which he obviously attempted to convert the workers’ newspaper
into an instrument for the propaganda, not of Marxism, but of his own
empirio-monism. A. Bogdanov evidently attached so much importance to this
article that after it, i.e., since the spring of 1913, he sent in no more
articles.  

The question of Bogdanov’s contributions became a matter of principle
to our editorial board, who settled it in the way our readers already know.


Now a word about the Vperyod group In the columns of our
newspaper, it has been called
   “adventurist”.[1]


Owing to their inability to think politically and not like philistines,
the writers of the letter saw in this too an

    

insinuation against the personalities of the members of this group. This,
too, is absurd. Marxists call “adventurist” the policy pursued by groups
that do not take their stand on the basis of scientific socialism, such
groups, for instance, as the anarchists, Narodnik terrorists, and so
forth. No one will try to deny that the Vperyod group is leaning
towards an archo-syndicalism, or that they are tolerant of Lunacharsky’s
“god-building”,[4] Bogdanov’s idealism, and the doctrinal anarchist
proclivities of S. Volsky, and so forth. Insofar as the policy of the
Vperyod group has tended towards anarchism and syndicalism, every
Marxist will call it a policy of adventurism.  

This is simply a fact, which has been confirmed by the complete
break-up of the Vperyod group. As soon as the working-class
movement revived, this patchwork group, stitched together from the most
heterogeneous elements, without a definite political line or understanding
of the principles of class politics and Marxism, fell completely apart.


Marching under the banner of Marxism, the working-class movement will
ignore these groups, these “empirio-monists”, “god-builders”,
“anarchists”, and the like.

Lenin is referring to the conference of the extended Editorial
Board of “Proletary” held in Paris on June 8–17 (21–30),
1909, and attended by nine members of the Bolshevik Centre (elected by the
Bolshevik group of the Fifth [London] Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1907),
headed by Lenin, and by representatives of the St. Petersburg, Moscow
regional and Urals organisations.  

The meeting Was called to discuss the conduct of the otzovists and
ultimatumists. It dealt with the following questions: =

(1) otzovism and ultimatumism; =

(2) god-building tendencies among the Social-Democrats; =

(3) the attitude to Duma activities among other fields of Party work; =

(4) the tasks of the Bolsheviks in the Party; =

(5) the Party school being set up abroad (on Capri); =

(6) agitation for a Bolshevik congress or Bolshevik conference separate
from the Party; =

(7) the breakaway of Comrade Maximov, and other questions.  

In the chair was Lenin, who spoke on the main items of the
agenda. Otzovism and ultimatumism at the meeting were represented and
defended by A. Bogdanov (Maximov) and V. Shantser (Marat). Kamenev,
Zinoviev, Rykov and Tomsky took a conciliatory stand.  


The meeting condemned otzovism and ultimatumism as being
“liquidationism inside out”. The Capri “Party” school organised by the
otzovists was declared to be “the centre of the breakaway
faction”. A. Bogdanov refused to accept the rulings of the extended
editorial board of Proletary and was expelled from the Bolshevik
organisation.  

The meeting also condemned god-building and resolved to wage a
determined struggle against it by exposing its anti-Marxist character. (See
present edition, Vol. 15 “Conference of the Ex tended Editorial Board of
Proletary”.)

God-building—a philosophical trend, hostile to Marxism,
which arose in the period of the Stolypin reaction among a section of the
Party intellectuals, who departed from Marxism after the defeat of the
Revolution of 1905–07. The god-builders (A. V. Lunacharsky, V. Bazarov and
others) advocated the creation of a new, “socialist” religion in an
attempt to reconcile Marxism with religion. At one time they were joined by
Maxim Gorky.  

The reactionary nature of god-building was revealed by Lenin in his
book Materialism and Empirio-criticism and in his letters to Gorky
during February–April 1908 and November-December 1913.

We gladly publish Comrade
Veteran’s[2] article, which gives an outline of the history of the
national question among the Letts in general and in the Lettish
Social-Democratic Party in particular. Draft amendments or addenda by
Lettish Marxists for the decision by the Summer (1913)
Conference[3] would be very welcome. Lettish Social-Democrats have long
been in sympathy with the Bund; but this sympathy was shaken firstly by the
theoretical criticism of the Marxists, and secondly by the Bundists’
separatism in practice, particularly after 1906. We hope that the
discussion of the national question among Lettish Social-Democrats will
continue and that it will lead to the adoption of definite decisions.  

As regards Comrade Veteran’s remarks, we have only the following
comment to make. He thinks our reference to
     Switzerland[1]

unconvincing because all three nations in that country are historical and
have been equal from the very beginning. But “nations without a history”
cannot find models or patterns anywhere (apart from utopias) except among
historical nations. As for the equality of nations, that is something even
advocates of “cultural-national autonomy” take for granted. Consequently,
the experience of civilised mankind tells us that where genuine
equality of nations and consistent democracy exist, “cultural-national
autonomy”, is superfluous; and where they do not exist, it
remains utopian, and propaganda in its favour is propaganda in favour of
refined nationalism.

The symposium herewith presented to the reader consists of
articles written between 1909 and 1914. This was a period in which the
working-class movement in Russia encountered particularly serious
difficulties. Marxists, however, were not and could not be content with
simply pointing to the difficulties, with simply complaining about the
general disintegration; break-down, and so forth. It was necessary to
determine the economic and political causes of the break-down from the
point of view of the particular stage of Russia’s capitalist development,
and determine the class significance of the broadest trend that
reflected this break down, namely, the trend of liquidationism.


The basic answer to this question, which is extremely important to the
working-class movement, was given by the Marxists in December 1908 in the
form of very precise, fully formulated and official
decisions.[2] These decisions had to be clarified, disseminated and
applied to the everyday problems of the economic and political
movement. This was done in the articles we have collected in the present
symposium, which, for reasons “beyond the editors’ control” is
unfortunately far from complete.  

At present, after a Marxist daily press has been in existence in
St. Petersburg for nearly two years, the entire question of the
significance and appraisal of liquidationism, not only in theory, but also
in practice, has been submitted—if one may so express it—to
the decision of the workers themselves. This is tremendously fortunate for
the working-class movement of Russia, and a great sign of its maturity. The
class-conscious workers are themselves seeking the truth, and they will
find it; they will determine the class significance

    

of liquidationism, employ the practical experience of their mass movement
to verify its appraisal, and devise expedient methods to combat it.  

Our object in publishing the present symposium is to come to the aid of
all workers interested in the fate of the movement of their class. The
articles are given here, not in their chronological order, but according to
subjects, in the order (approximately) of their transition from
theory to practice.  

First come the fundamental questions (Section 1) a solution for which
must be found if we are to have anything like intelligent tactics and an
intelligent policy. Here the reader will, find an appraisal of the present
historical situation and of the class significance of the struggle of the
Marxist trends. The next question dealt with is that of the hegemony of the
proletariat in connection with the criticism of the liquidator’s principal
“work” (The Social Movement). And lastly, come articles on the
question of the bourgeoisie s “swing to the left”.  

Then come (Section 2) articles on the election campaign, on the results
of the Fourth Duma elections, and on Duma tactics.  

After that comes (Section 3) the question of the “open party”, and
the question of unity, which is inseparably connected with it.  

Section 4 deals with liberal-labour politics in its various
applications. After a general appraisal of reformism comes an examination
of the questions of “partial demands”, freedom of association, the strike
movement, the attitude of the liquidators towards the liberals, and vice
versa.  

The last subject (Section 5) is the liquidators and the working-class
movement. Here the reader will find an appraisal, of the working-class
movement in the years 1905–07 given by Koltsov, one of the leaders of
liquidationism, in his principal work; an examination of the workers’
attitude towards the liquidators in practice; and the most up-to-date
material on the history of the formation of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour group in the Duma.  

In the “conclusion” an attempt is made to review the struggle of
trends in the present-day working-class movement.  
 

We permit ourselves the hope that our symposium will help the workers
to find and study the data on the controversial issues. Naturally, we have
been unable to include a good deal of important material. On the
other hand, in a symposium of articles by different authors written over a
Series of years repetition is inevitable. There are, of course; individual
shades among the authors. But, taken together, all their articles are no
more than a commentary, an application of formulated Marxist decisions,
whose recognition, among other things, distinguishes the class-conscious
organised Marxist workers from the liquidators of the workers’ party, and
from those who are dropping away from the Party. One of our main objects is
to clarify and test these decisions, and to make it easier to formulate
such amendments and addenda to them as may become necessary in the course
of time.  

February 1914

Marxism and Liquidationism. A Symposium of Articles on the
Fundamental Issues of the Modern Labour Movement. Part II
appeared in 1914, published by Priboi, the Party’s publishing
house. Lenin’s manuscript plan for this publication lists the articles he
thought should be included in this symposium, and mentions the various
issues of the newspapers from which these articles were to be taken (Lenin
changed the headings of some of the articles for the symposium). According
to this plan, the symposium was to be in two parts, whose contents were
announced in the newspaper Put Pravdy No. 42 for March 21, 1914.


Part I of the symposium did not appear. Several dozen copies of
Part II, which the publishers were late in taking delivery of from the
printers, were confiscated. The bulk of the edition, however, was
distributed.  


Part II of the symposium contained, in addition to the Preface dated
February 1914 and Concluding Remarks, fourteen articles by Lenin, namely: =

“The Legal Party and the Marxists”, =

“A Liberal Labour Party Manifesto”, =

“How P. B. Axelrod Exposes the Liquidators”, =

“The Separatism of the Bund”, =

“Marxism and Reformism”, =

“The Liberal Bourgeoisie and Reformism”, =

“Liberal Blindness”, =

“A Necessary Explanation”, =

“Economic and Political Strikes”, =

“A Talk on ‘Cadet-Eating’\thinspace”, =

“The Nature and Significance of Our Polemics Against the Liberals”, =

“The Liberal Bourgeoisie and the Liquidators”, =

“The Working Class and Its Press”, and =

“Material on the History of the Formation of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Group in the Duma”.  

The latter article has a supplement specially written for the
symposium—an article entitled “How the Workers Responded to the
Formation of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Group in the Duma”. (See
pp. 536–43 of this volume.) In June 1914, Lenin, in a footnote to this
article (see p. 542 of this volume), gave new figures concerning monetary
contributions to the Marxist and liquidationist newspapers made through the
Duma groups.

Put Pravdy (No. 18) of last Friday published an
article entitled “Mr. Struve on the Need to ‘Reform the
       Government’”[1]

in which we informed our readers of the appraisal of the political
situation in Russia given by one of the most outspoken and consistent of
the counter-revolutionary liberals.  

The next day Rech published-a tremendously long “doctrinal”
article by Mr. Milyukov “against” Mr. Struve in connection with this very
article on the need to reform the government. It will be useful to dwell on
this dispute between the two liberals, firstly, because vital issues of
Russian politics Are involved, and secondly, because it reveals the two
political types of leading bourgeois. And they are types that will
have important political significance in Russia for a long time to come,
for decades, types that are of similar significance in all capitalist
countries. In its own interests, the proletariat must know these types.


During the past few years Mr. Struve has set forth his views most fully
and clearly in the book
Vekhi.[2] These are the views of a counter-revolutionary
liberal, an adherent of religion (and of philosophical idealism as the
truest and most “scholarly” road to it), and an opponent of
democracy. They are the clear, distinctly expressed views, not of an
individual, but of a class, for as a matter of fact the entire
mass of the Octobrist and Cadet bourgeoisie in Russia during
1907–14 subscribed to them.  

The crux of the matter is that the Octobrist and Cadet bourgeoisie have
swung to the right, away from democracy. The crux of the matter is that
this bourgeoisie is more afraid

    

of the people than of reaction. The crux of the matter is that this
rightward swing has not been accidental, but has been caused by the class
struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The crux of the
matter is that Struve and then Maklakov have told the truth about their
class and their party more frankly than other Cadets have.  

And this home truth has been very unpalatable to the diplomats of the
Cadet Party (headed by Mr. Milyukov), who deem it necessary to flirt with
democracy in the belief that the role of this democracy is not quite played
out, and that the bourgeoisie may perhaps have to live and act in a milieu
created, not only by the Purishkeviches but—God forbid—by the
democracy, by the “mob”, by the “street”, by the workers.  

While taking the same line as Mr. Struve and Mr. Maklakov, Mr. Milyukov
tries to cover it up, show himself off before the public, fool democracy
and keep it in leading strings. That is why Mr. Milyukov pretends
that he disagrees with Vekhi, that he disagrees with Struve, and
that he is refuting Maklakov, when as a matter of fact he is
merely teaching Struve and Maklakov how to conceal their thoughts more
cunningly.  

The gist of Mr. Milyukov’s long article against Struve is his
accusation that Struve is “hopelessly muddled”.  

Hot and strong, is it not?  

Where is the muddle? It is in Struve’s holding the “optimistic”
belief that the government can be reformed, while at the same time saying
that it is learning no lessons from the “upheavals” and is making them
inevitable. The way out, according to Mr. Struve, is either “unrest”, or
the reform of government. As for the first way out, Mr. Struve does not
want to “effectively work” for it or even “wish” it.  

Mr. Struve is indeed muddled, but then so is
Mr. Milyukov—completely, absolutely muddled, for neither can the
Constitutional-Democratic Party—of which Milyukov is the
leader—“wish” the first way out or “effectively work” for it.  

This is proved, not by words (those who in politics judge men and
parties by their words are foolish), but by their deeds, i.e., by
the entire history of the Constitutional-Democratic Party from
1905 to 1914, for almost a decade.  
 

The Constitutional-Democratic Party is more afraid of siding with the
workers (on questions of the minimum programme, of course) than of being
dependent on the Purishkeviches.  

This applies to the entire party, to the entire Cadet and Octobrist
bourgeoisie. And Milyukov simply makes himself ridiculous when he tries to
lay the blame for this on Struve alone.  

In all countries the experience of history shows that a bourgeoisie
which desires progress vacillates between siding with the workers and being
dependent on the Purishkeviches. In all countries—and the more civilised
amid free the country, the more marked this is—we see two types of
bourgeois politicians. One type openly leans towards religion, towards the
Purishkeviches, towards a forthright struggle against democracy, and tries
to build imp consistent theoretical evidence to support this tendency. The
other type specialises in covering up this very same tendency by
flirting with democracy.  

There are diplomatic Milyukovs everywhere, and the workers must learn
to detect the cloven hoof at once.

The Left-Narodnik talk about the “labouring” peasantry is
such a scandalous imposture and corruption of the socialist
consciousness of the workers that it is necessary to examine it again and
again.  

The more our Left Narodniks flaunt their platitudes and saccharine
speeches, the more important it becomes to counter them with precise data
on peasant economy.  

There is nothing the Left Narodnik fights shy of so much as
precise data on the peasant bourgeoisie and the peasant
proletariat.  

Let us take the returns of the last Zemstvo statistical survey of the
peasants in the vicinity of
Moscow.[1] Here agriculture has taken on a relatively very pronounced
commercial character due to the considerable development of fruit and
vegetable farming. And this example of a district that is more developed as
regards the domination of the market reveals all the more strikingly the
essential features of all peasant economy under
capitalism.  

The first district of Moscow suburban peasant economy (we take only
this one district because, unfortunately, the statistics do not give us
general summaries) covers over two thousand peasant farms. The
number is sufficiently large to enable us to study the typical relations
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie among the “labouring”
peasantry.  

It is noteworthy that capitalist agriculture here is developing on
ordinary land with farms of extremely small size, 2,336 peasant farms
having a total of 4,253 dessiatines of allotment land, i.e., an average of
less than two dessiatines per farm. If we add 1,761 dessiatines of leased
land and subtract 625 dessiatines of land rented out, we get a total

    

of 5,389 dessiatines, i.e., an average of more than two dessiatines per
farm. Nevertheless, two-thirds of the peasants employ hired labour!  

The higher the level of agricultural techniques, the more intensive the
farming, and the stronger the influence of the market, the more often do we
meet with large-scale production on small plots of
land. This is constantly overlooked by bourgeois professors and our Left
Narodniks, who are so enthusiastic about small farms (reckoned in area of
land), and gloss over the capitalist nature of modern small farms
that employ hired labour.  

Let us examine the trade that is going on in allotment land. The
figures for leased and rented out laud show that this trade is very
considerable. About half the leased land is allotment
land. Altogether, 625 dessiatines of allotment land is rented out,
and 845 dessiatines are leased. Clearly, the old system of-allotment land
tenure, which by its very nature is identified with serfdom and
medievalism, is be coming an obstacle to modern trade and
capitalist circulation. Capitalism is breaking down the old system
of allotment tenure. Farming is not adapting itself to the
official allotment, but is demanding the free sale and
purchase of land, free renting and leasing in conformity with the demands
of the market, the requirements of the bourgeois economic system.  

Take the peasant proletariat. Under this category, first of all, come
405 households (out of the 2,336) which are either landless or have up to
half a dessiatine of land. These 405 households own 437 dessiatines of
allotment land. But these are poor, largely horseless, peasants, who do not
have the wherewithal to engage in farming. They rent out 372
dessiatines—the greater part of their land—and are themselves becoming
wage-workers. Of the 405 households, 376 “provide” agricultural
labourers, or industrial workers who have given up farming.  

Take the richest peasant bourgeoisie. Here 526 households have farms of
over three dessiatines. This already is capitalist farming, with fruit and
vegetable growing. Of these 526 farmers, 509 employ labourers. The working
members of the families number 1,706, and they employ 1,248 labourers (by
the year or season), exclusive of day-labourers (51,000 working days).

 

These households own a total of 1,540 dessiatines, an average of less
than three dessiatines of allotment land per household. But they rent out
only 42 and lease 1,102 dessiatines, of which 512 dessiatines is allotment
land! By “concentrating” land in this way, these “labouring” peasants,
having an average of three working members of the faintly per
farm, are becoming typical bourgeois with an average of two and a half
hired labourers per farm and nearly a hundred hired day-labourer
working days. The buying and selling of the produce of land leads
to the development of the buying and selling of land itself
(leasing and renting out), and to the buying and selling of
labour-power.  

Now consider the Left Narodniks’ assertion that the abolition of
private ownership of the land means “withdrawing the land” from
commercial circulation! This is a purely philistine fairy-tale. In fact,
the very opposite is the case; this abolition would draw the land into
commercial circulation on a vaster scale than ever before. The
capital now being spent on the purchase of land would be released, the
feudal and bureaucratic obstacles to the free transfer of land from one
person to another would disappear, and capitalism, i. e., the renting out
of land by the proletariat and the “concentration” of land by the
bourgeoisie, would develop still more rapidly.  

This measure, which is useful as a means of fighting the feudal
landlords, the Left Narodniks try to pass off as “socialism”, though
actually it is only a bourgeois measure. It is undeniable that the peasant
proletarians and the peas ant bourgeoisie have common interests
against the landlords. Every Marxist working man knows that, but to
obscure consciousness of the class antagonisms between the
proletariat and the bourgeoisie by jabber about the “labouring” peasantry
means deserting to the bourgeoisie, deserting to the enemies of socialism.


Moscow suburban farming shows us, as if under a magnifying glass, what
is going on everywhere in Russia in a milder and less definable
form. Everywhere the peasant who does not hire himself out or does not
himself employ hired labour is already becoming the exception. Every day,
even in the remoter districts, we find trade developing, and the gulf
between the proletarians (hired workers) and the small proprietors,

    

the petty bourgeoisie, the peasants, widening more and more.  

It is the aim of the urban proletariat to develop a clear realisation
of this class antagonism, which, in the rural districts, is
obscured by the specific features of agriculture and the survivals of
serfdom. It is the aim of the bourgeoisie, in whose footsteps the
petty-bourgeois Left Narodniks are foolishly following, to hinder
the realisation of this class antagonism by means of empty, meaningless and
utterly false phrases about the “labouring” peasantry.

In connection with V. Maklakov’s Duma speeches and his
press statements in favour of the “new” plan for combining the tactics of
the Cadets and Octobrists, there has of late been a good deal of talk about
the revival of liberalism. The Zemstvo banquet in Moscow has lent colour to
these rumours.  

It is noteworthy that particular emphasis has been laid on the fact
that even V. Maklakov, that most moderate of liberals, with a
leaning towards Octobrism, has lost “faith in the possibility of a way
being found out of the impasse without revolutionary upheavals and
cataclysms”. This, literally, is what is written in Rech, the
chief organ of the liberals, by Mr. Shingaryov who, together with
Mr. Milyukov, pretends to criticise the “Right” Cadets,
V. Maklakov and P. Struve, “from the left”.  

But the disputes among the Cadets have been most trifling. They have
been arguing whether the proposal made to the Octobrists about joining the
opposition is new or not, and whether that proposal, which has been made a
hundred times and never led to anything, is worth repeating for the hundred
and first time. Behind these absolutely meaningless disputes one can
discern the liberals’ chief and common cause of worry, which
hinders the cause of Russia’s liberation only slightly less than the
Octobrists’ vacillations. You gentlemen of the liberal fold, who are
arguing all the time with the Octobrists and about the Octobrists, should
take a good look at yourselves!  

Take the small political encyclopaedia issued by Rech and
entitled The Year-Book for 1914. Among its contributors are the
most prominent and most responsible Cadets, the acknowledged leaders of the
party, headed by Milyukov and

    

Shingaryov. In the survey of “Our Public Life” (by Mr. Izgoyev), we read
the following appraisal of the fundamental issues in Russian home policies:



   “By its excessive zeal the Administration is only
   weakening the anti-revolutionary forces within the community.”  


Don’t you think it absurd, Messrs. the Cadets, to hurl thunderbolts at
the Octobrists, when the most genuine Octobrism is preached in your own
publications?  

A result of the Administration’s “hopeless and misguided” struggle
against educational institutions, writes Mr. Izgoyev, is: 


   “a corruption of life, leading to the weakening of the
   purely public [!]  activity, which produces the spiritual antidotes to
   ideas that are really a menace to the country”.  


Now this is a tone worthy, not only of an Octobrist, but even of a
prosecutor, a
Shcheglovitov.[1] And as if to illustrate what these “ideas that are a
menace to the country” are, our liberal says: 


   “One can understand [from the point of view of the
   corruption of life by the misguided Administration] why at workers’
   meetings and in the trade unions the Bolsheviks gain the upper hand over
   the more level-headed and cultured leaders [!?] of the working-class
   movement.”  


This political appraisal of the liquidators is uttered and reiterated
by the liberals times without number. As a matter of fact, we have here
nothing more nor less than a political alliance between the liberals and
the liquidators. In turning their backs on the “underground” and
advocating a legal party the liquidators are doing in the ranks of the
workers exactly what the liberals want them to do.

Narodniks and Liquidators in the Trade Union Movement

In recent issues of the Left-Narodnik newspaper, we find,
side by side with complaints about our (the Pravdists’) “factionalism”,
valuable admissions by several Narodniks about their views on important
issue of the trade union movement coinciding with those of the
liquidators. We have always said it, but it is pleasant indeed to hear this
confession from our opponents’ lips.  

“On this question we differ sharply from the Bolsheviks, who regard
the union, as their special preserve [!]... The Mensheviks’ view [for some
reason the Narodniks say “Mensheviks” instead of “liquidators”] of the
union as an extra-factional organisation is identical with ours [the
Narodniks’]. This, perhaps, accounts for our good relations with the
Mensheviks in past activities.” This was written in Vernaya Mysl
No. 6.  

“The line of conduct taken by the executives of those unions in which
the Left Narodniks have been in control all the time in no way differs from
the, line of conduct of the so-called liquidationist unions,” the same
Left-Narodnik newspaper added.  

An extraordinarily frank and valuable admission! On their own showing,
it appears that our “frightfully Left” Narodniks behave in the trade
union movement exactly like the liquidators.  

Hence, the blocs (alliances, agreements) between the liquidators and
the Narodniks against the Marxists, which have been repeated]y mentioned in
our press.  

The Narodnik Stoikaya
Mysl[2] even frankly defends these blocs between the Left Narodniks
and the liquidators against the Marxists.  
 

“During the present period of Pravdist preponderance in the trade
union organisations ... there is nothing terrible or strange in temporary
agreements between the Narodniks and the Luchists,” writes Stoikaya
Mysl
No. 2.[1]


The liquidators are not so candid. They know that “such things” are
done, but not spoken of. To call oneself a Social-Democrat while at the
same time allying with an alien party against the Social-Democrats is
“tactics” that can be pursued only underhandedly


But this does not change anything. The alliance between the liquidators
and the Narodniks in the trade union movement (and in the educational
societies) is a fact. And in the present state of affairs it is
inevitable. The liquidators and the Narodniks are united by their common
hostility towards consistent Marxism, in all spheres of activity. In trade
union activity they are united in both being representatives of the
“neutralism of weakness”, “willy-nilly
neutralism”. Neither the liquidators nor the Narodniks have any real
influence in the trade union movement. Although a feeble minority, they
demand “equality” with the Marxists. This demand is “theoretically”
defensible only from the neutralist point of view. Hence the “neutralism”
of all groups with little influence in the working-class movement.  

The Narodniks say that they are uniting with the liquidators
“solely for the purpose of protecting the non-factionalism of the
workers’ organisations against the extravagant claims of the
Pravdists” (Stoikaya Mysl Nos. 2 and 4).  

What are these “claims” of the Pravdists? Have they shut the door of
any union or society to workers who hold political views different from
their own? Have they stuck any “label” on any of the unions? Have they
split any organisation? They have done nothing of the kind! Our opponents
have not quoted a single fact of this kind, nor can they do

    

so. By the “extravagant claims” of the Pravdists they mean that the
Pravdists do not want to associate themselves with the petty-bourgeois
policy of the Narodniks and liquidators, and, while loyally submitting to
the majority of the workers within a single union, they fight for
influence for their Marxist ideas.  

We have never been guilty of the sins ascribed to us. It is the
Narodniks and the liquidators who are guilty of them. Here are the
facts. Several years ago the Narodniks obtained a majority in the
Railwaymen’s Union. This happened because they had the backing, not of the
workers, but of the railway clerks, and because of other fortuitous
circumstances. What did the Narodniks do? They immediately “stuck a
label” on that union, compelled it to adopt its own special “platform”,
ousted the Social-Democrats and non-Party workers, and compelled them to
form a parallel union of their own.  

Now that was a really “extravagant claim”. They hastened to make good
their first chance victory by affixing a label. The fact that the Narodniks
do not do this in other unions is not because they are so virtuous, but
because their influence everywhere among the workers is very
slight.  

The same thing applies to the liquidators. When they controlled the
Metalworkers’ Union they turned it into a branch of the liquidators’
organisation. The organ of the union published provocative articles against
the “underground” (see Nash Put No. 20, p. 2, Metallist
No. 3,
etc.[3]), although no general meeting of the members ever expressed
approval of the liquidator line.  

Such are the actual facts. By the “extravagant claims” of the
Pravdists they mean that the Pravdists try to get the workers to settle
their affairs themselves by a majority vote. If at a general meeting of
metalworkers 3,000 vote for the Pravdists and a hundred or two vote for the
liquidators and the Narodniks combined, then, in the name of so-called
“non-factionalism” we are supposed to admit that 3,000 is equal to 200!
This is what liquidator-Narodnik “non-factionalism” means.  

We do not defend neutralism; we are opposed to it. But we do not behave
like the Narodniks and liquidators when they obtain a chance majority in
some union. Only feeble

    

groups with no principles lose their heads at the first “victory” and
hasten to “consolidate” their victory by a majority of a score or so of
votes. Excited and in a hurry not to miss such a golden opportunity, they
hastily revise their “principles”, forget their neutralism, and stick on
a label. Marxists do not behave like that. They are not stray visitors in
the working-class movement. They know that sooner or later all the unions
will take their stand on the basis of Marxism. They are convinced that the
future belongs to their ideas and, therefore, they do not force events, do
not goad the unions on, and do not stick labels on them or split them.


Steadily and confidently they carry on their Marxist propaganda. They
patiently teach Marxism to the workers, drawing on the lessons of life, and
no deals between unprincipled groups will divert them from that path.  

There was a time when the present-day liquidators demanded that the
trade unions should be Party unions and have official representation in the
Party. There was a time when the Narodniks compelled the Railwaymen’s Union
to officially swear allegiance to their programme. Today both have swung to
the opposite extreme, and stand for neutralism. They have been compelled to
do this by the political weakness of their positions.  

We are following our old road, proclaimed long ago and upheld by the
entire body of Marxists. The liquidators have a full right to enter into an
alliance with the Narodniks. But it is an alliance based on abandonment of
principles and on weakness. The road which the liquidator-Narodnik bloc
proposes to the unions is not the road of the advanced workers.  

 
Notes
 

[1]
Mr. Boris Voronov, the author of the article, his eyes big with
surprise, quotes as an example of incredible “factionalism” the fact that
at the meetings of the executive of one of the unions “they discussed the
question of assisting the Pravdist press, and technical editorial questions
(how to improve the correspondence, department, etc.)”. Oh, horror! What a
crime it is to assist a newspaper, which unites nine-tenths of the advanced
workers, with correspondence and the like! How, after this, can the
Narodniks help throwing themselves into the arms of the liquidators?...

Metallist—weekly organ of the Metalworkers’ Trade Union,
published in St. Petersburg from September 26 (October 9), 1911 to June 12
(25), 1914. Forty-five issues were put out. Till 1913 the Union’s Executive
and the Editorial Board were controlled by the liquidators, but after the
re-election of the Union’s Executive in May 1913 control of the Union and
the journal passed over to the Bolsheviks. Issues No. 7(31), No. 8(32) and
No. 10(34) for 1913 published the article by Lenin “Metalworkers’ Strikes
in 1912”. M. S. Olminsky, A. Y. Badayev, and G. I. Petrovsky were
contributors to the journal. Metallist was closely linked with the
working-class masses and played an important part in rallying them around
the Bolshevik Party. The tsarist government persecuted

   

the journal. Several of its issues were seized by the police; and after
issue No. 24 the journal was suspended for four months. For reasons of
censorship the journal changed its name several times to Kuznets
(The Smith), Nadezhda (Hope), Yedinstvo
(Unity), Nash Put (Our Way), etc.  

Lenin is referring to the editorials in the journals Nash Put
No. 20 for August 11, 1911 and Metallist No. 3 for October 27,
1911.

The liberal newspapers recently published or favourably
reported K. Arsenyev’s appeal for greater attention to be paid to the
collection of information on summary exile.  


   “Although numerous cases of arbitrary and lawless acts
   on the part of the Administration are reported in the newspapers,” wrote
   K. Arsenyev, “others, no less numerous and outrageous, pass unnoticed and
   unobserved. This omission could be rectified to a considerable extent if
   some sort of system were introduced in the collection of information on the
   subject. The reasons for summary exile and arrest, which are being widely
   practised to this day, especially among the workers, become known only by
   chance and, therefore, in a fragmentary way. Similarly, news about the
   condition of the exiles in their places of exile finds its way into the
   press only by accident.”  


What is true is true! The liberal parties, the liberal members of the
Duma, the liberal lawyers, the liberal journalists, various groups of
liberals, and so forth, could very easily collect and publish legally and
illegally, very full and systematic material on every one of those
cases which “are being widely practised, especially among the workers”.


Rech, for example, “heartily welcomed the advice and the
appeals coming from that highly respected public figure” K. Arsenyev.


Then why don’t you go ahead, gentlemen? Surely you, of all people, have
every opportunity and means of organising the proper collection and
publication of information about this “everyday feature” of Russian life,
which you all protest against and condemn, and about which you are always
talking!  But see, not a single liberal newspaper, which is a thousand
times better “provided for” (in all respects) against all kinds of
obstacles and barriers, collects precise information about all
cases of exile and arrest.  
 

We are obliged to say that our liberals are past masters in the art of
expressing good and pious wishes, but when it comes to publishing the names
of all those who have been exiled or to publishing information about them
and systematic reports of how they are faring, in Arsenyev’s own
Vestnik Yevropy, or in Russkiye
Vedomosti,[1] or in Rech, then nothing is done.  

Evidently, it is much easier (and safer) to “support” appeals in word
than to do something in response to those appeals....

Russkiye Vedomosti (Russian Recorder)—a newspaper published
in Moscow from 1863 onwards. Expressed the views of the moderate liberal
intelligentsia. In the eighties and nineties writers of the democratic camp
contributed to it (among them V. G. Korolenko, Saltykov-Shchedrin, Gleb
Uspensky) and the paper published articles by liberal Narodniks. In 1905 it
became the organ of the Right wing of the Constitutional-Democrats. Lenin
commented on the fact that Russkiye Vedomosti was an unusual
combination of “Right Cadetism and Narodnik overtones”. (See
present edition. Vol. 19, p. 135.) In 1918 the paper was closed down
together with other counter-revolutionary newspapers.

Liberal Professor Mr. Tugan-Baranovsky is on the war path
against socialism. This time he has approached the question, not from the
political and economic angle, but from that of an abstract discussion on
equality (perhaps the professor thought such an abstract discussion more
suitable for the religious and philosophical gatherings which he has
addressed?).  


   “If we take socialism, not as an economic theory, but as
   a living ideal,” Mr. Tugan declared, “then, undoubtedly, it is associated
   with the ideal of equality, but equality is a concept ... that cannot be
   deduced from experience and reason.”  


This is the reasoning of a liberal scholar who repeats the incredibly
trite and threadbare argument that experience and reason clearly prove that
men are not equal, yet socialism bases its ideal on
equality. Hence, socialism, if you please, is an absurdity which is
contrary to experience and reason, and so forth!  

Mr. Tugan repeats the old trick of the reactionaries:
first to misinterpret socialism by making it out to be an absurdity, and
then to triumphantly refute the absurdity! When we say that experience and
reason prove that men are not equal, we mean by equality, equality
in abilities or similarity in physical strength and
mental ability.  

It goes without saying that in this respect men are not
equal. No sensible person and no socialist forgets this. But this
kind of equality has nothing whatever to do with
socialism. If Mr. Tugan is quite unable to think, he is at least
able to read; were lie to Lake the well-known work of one of the
founders of scientific socialism, Frederick Engels, directed against
DÃ¼hring, he would find there a special section explaining the absurdity
of imagining that economic equality means anything else than the
abolition of classes. But when professors set out to refute
socialism, one never knows what to wonder at most—their stupidity, their
ignorance, or their unscrupulousness.  

Since we have Mr. Tugan to deal with, we shall have to start with the
rudiments.  

By political equality Social-Democrats mean equal rights, and
by economic equality, as we have already said, they mean the abolition
of classes. As for establishing human equality in the sense of
equality of strength and abilities (physical and mental), socialists do not
even think of such things.  

Political equality is a demand for equal political rights for
all citizens of a country who have reached, a certain age and who
do not suffer from either ordinary or liberal-professorial
feeble-mindedness. This demand was first advanced, not by the socialists,
not by the proletariat, but by the bourgeoisie. The well-known
historical experience of all countries of the world proves this, and
Mr. Tugan could easily have discovered this had he not called
“experience” to witness solely in order to dupe students and workers, and
please the powers that be by “abolishing” socialism.  

The bourgeoisie put forward the demand for equal rights for
all citizens in the struggle against medieval, feudal, serf-owner and caste
privileges. In Russia, for example, unlike America, Switzerland and other
countries, the privileges of the nobility are preserved to this day in all
spheres of political life, in elections to the Council of State, in
elections to the Duma, in municipal administration, in taxation, and many
other things.  

Even the most dull-witted and ignorant person can grasp the fact that
individual members of the nobility are not equal in physical and
mental abilities any more than are people belonging to the “tax-paying”,
“base”, ‘low-born” or “non-privileged”
peasant class. But in rights all nobles are equal, just
as all the peasants are equal in their lack of rights.  
 

Does our learned liberal Professor Tugan now under stand the difference
between equality in the sense of equal rights, and equality in the sense of
equal strength and abilities?  

We shall now deal with economic equality. In the United States of
America, as in other advanced countries, there are no medieval
privileges. All citizens, are equal in political rights. But are they equal
as regards their position in social production?  

No, Mr. Tugan, they are not. Some own land, factories and capital and
live on the unpaid labour of the workers; these form an insignificant
minority. Others, namely, the vast mass of the population, own no means of
production and live only by selling their labour-power; these are
proletarians.  

In the United States of America there is no aristocracy, and the
bourgeoisie and the proletariat enjoy equal political rights. But
they are not equal in class status: one class, the
capitalists, own the means of production and live on the unpaid labour of
the workers. The other class, the wage-workers, the proletariat, own no
means of production and live by selling their labour-power in the market.


The abolition of classes means placing all citizens on an
equal footing with regard to the means of production
belonging to society as a whole. It means giving all citizens
equal opportunities of working on the publicly-owned means of
production, on the publicly-owned land, at the publicly-owned factories,
and so forth.  

This explanation of socialism has been necessary to enlighten our
learned liberal professor, Mr. Tugan, who may, if he tries hard, now grasp
the fact that it is absurd to expect equality of strength and
abilities in socialist society.  

In brief, when socialists speak of equality they always mean
social equality, equality of social status, and not by any means
the physical and mental equality of individuals.  

The puzzled reader may ask: how could a learned liberal professor have
forgotten these elementary axioms familiar to anybody who has read any
exposition of the views of socialism? The answer is simple: the
personal qualities of

    

present-day professors are such that we may find among them even
exceptionally stupid people like Tugan. But the social status of
professors in bourgeois society is such that only those are allowed to hold
such posts who sell science to serve the interests of capital, and agree to
utter the most fatuous nonsense, the most unscrupulous drivel and twaddle
against the socialists. The bourgeoisie will forgive the professors all
this as long as they go on “abolishing” socialism.

What is taking place today in the British Parliament in
connection with the Bill on Irish Home Rule is of exceptional
interest as far as class relationships and elucidation of the national and
the agrarian problems are concerned.  

For centuries England has enslaved Ireland, condemned the Irish
peasants to unparalleled misery and gradual extinction from starvation,
driven them off the land and compelled hundreds of thousands and even
millions of them to leave their native country and emigrate to America. At
the beginning of the nineteenth century, Ireland had a population of five
and a half millions; today the population is only four and one-third
millions. Ireland has become depopulated. Over five million Irish emigrated
to America in the course of the nineteenth century, so that there are now
more Irish in the United States than there are in Ireland!  

The appalling destitution and sufferings of the Irish peasantry are an
instructive example of the lengths to which the landowners and the liberal
bourgeoisie of a “dominant” nation will go. Britain owes her
“brilliant” economic development and the “prosperity” of her industry
and commerce largely to her treatment of the Irish peasantry, which recalls
the misdeeds of the Russian serf-owner
Saltychikha.[1] 

While Britain “flourished”, Ireland moved towards extinction and
remained an undeveloped, semi-barbarous, purely agrarian country, a land of
poverty-stricken tenant farmers. But much as the “enlightened and
liberal” British bourgeoisie desired to perpetuate Ireland’s enslavement
and poverty, reform inevitably approached, the more so that the
revolutionary eruptions of the Irish people’s fight for liberty and land
became more and more ominous. The year 1861 saw

    

the formation of the Irish revolutionary organisation of
Fenians. Irish settlers in America gave it every assistance.  

With the formation, in 1868, of the government of Gladstone—that hero
of the liberal bourgeoisie and obtuse philistines—the era of
reform in Ireland set in, an era which has dragged on very nicely till
the present day, i.e., just under half a century. Oh, the wise statesmen of
the liberal bourgeoisie are very well able to “make haste slowly” in the
matter of reform!  

Karl Marx, who had been living in London for over fifteen years,
followed the struggle of the Irish with great interest and sympathy. He
wrote to Frederick Engels on November 2, 1867:
“I have done my best to bring about this demonstration of the English
workers in favour of Fenianism.... I used to think the separation of
Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable, although after
the separation there may come federation....” Reverting to the same
subject in a letter dated November 30th of the same year, Marx wrote:
“The question now is, what shall we advise the English workers? In my
opinion they must make the repeal of the Union [the abolition of the union
with Ireland] (in short, the affair of 1783, only democratised and adapted
to the conditions of the time) an article of their
pronunziamento. This is the only legal and therefore only possible
form of Irish emancipation which can be admitted in the programme of an
English [workers’]
party.”[2] And Marx went on to show that what the Irish needed was Home
Rule and independence of Britain, an agrarian revolution and tariffs
against Britain.  

Such was the programme proposed to the British workers by Marx, in the
interests of Irish freedom, of accelerating the social development and
freedom of the British workers; because the British workers could not
become free so long as they helped to keep another nation in slavery (or
even allowed it).  

Alas! Owing to a number of special historical causes, the British
workers of the last third of the nineteenth century proved dependent upon
the Liberals, impregnated with the spirit of liberal-labour policy. They
proved to be, not at the head of nations and classes fighting for liberty,
but in

    

the wake of the contemptible lackeys of the money-bags, the British
Liberals.  

And the Liberals have for half a century been dragging out
Ireland’s liberation, which has not been completed to this day! It was not
until the twentieth century that the Irish peasant began to turn from a
tenant farmer into a free holder; but the Liberals have imposed upon him a
system of land purchase at a “fair” price! He
has paid, and will continue to pay for many years, millions upon millions
to the British landlords as a reward for their having robbed him for
centuries and reduced him to a state of chronic starvation. The British
liberal bourgeois has made the Irish peasant thank the landlord for this in
hard cash....  

A Home Rule Bill for Ireland is now going through
Parliament. But in Ireland there is the Northern province of Ulster, which
is inhabited partly by English-born Protestants as distinct from the
Catholic Irish. Well then, the British Conservatives, led by Carson, the
British version of our Black-Hundred landlord Purishkevich, have raised a
frightful outcry against Irish Home Rule. This, they say, means subjecting
Ulstermen to an alien people of alien creed! Lord Carson has threatened
rebellion, and has organised gangs of reactionary armed thugs for this
purpose.  

An empty threat, of course. There can be no question of a rebellion by
a handful of hoodlums. Nor could there be any question of an Irish
Parliament (whose powers are determined by British law)
“oppressing” the Protestants.  

It is simply a question of the reactionary landlords trying to
scare the Liberals.  

And the Liberals are losing their nerve, bowing to the reactionaries,
making concessions to them, offering to conduct a referendum in
Ulster and put off reform for Ulster for six years!  

The haggling between the Liberals and the reactionaries
continues. Reform can wait: the Irish have waited half a century; they can
wait a little longer; you can’t very well “offend” the landlords!  

Of course, if the Liberals appealed to the people of Britain, to the
proletariat, Carson’s reactionary gangs would melt away immediately and
disappear. The peaceful and full achievement of freedom by Ireland would be
guaranteed.  
 

But is it conceivable that the liberal bourgeois will turn to the
proletariat for aid against the landlords? Why, the Liberals in Britain are
also lackeys of the money-bags,capable only of cringing to the Carsons.

Capitalism cannot be at a standstill for a single
moment. It must forever be moving forward. Competition, which is keenest in
a period of crisis like the present, calls for the invention of an
increasing number of new devices to reduce the cost of production. But the
domination of capital converts all these devices into instruments for the
further exploitation of the workers.  

The Taylor system is one of these devices.  

Advocates of this system recently used the following techniques in
America.  

An electric lamp was attached to a worker’s arm, the worker’s movements
were photographed and the movements of the lamp studied. Certain movements
were found to be to “superfluous” and the worker was made to avoid them,
i.e., to work more intensively, without losing a second for rest.  

The layout of new factory buildings is planned in such a way that not a
moment will be lost in delivering materials to the factory, in conveying
them from one shop to another, and in dispatching the finished
products. The cinema is systematically employed for studying the work of
the best operatives and increasing its intensity, i.e., “speeding up” the
workers.  

For example, a mechanic’s operations were filmed in the course of a
whole day. After studying the mechanic’s movements the efficiency experts
provided him with a bench high enough to enable him to avoid losing time in
bending down. He was given a boy to assist him. This boy had to hand up
each part of the machine in a definite and most efficient way. Within a few
days the mechanic performed the work of

    

assembling the given type of machine in one-fourth of the time it
had taken before!  

What an enormous gain in labour productivity!... But the worker’s pay
is not increased fourfold, but only half as much again, at the very most,
and only for a short period at that. As soon as the workers get
used to the new system their pay is cut to the former level. The capitalist
obtains an enormous profit, but the workers toil four times as hard as
before and wear down their nerves and muscles four times as fast as before.


A newly engaged worker is taken to the factory cinema where he is shown
a “model” performance of his job; the worker is made to “catch up” with
that performance. A week later he is taken to the cinema again and shown
pictures of his own performance, Which is then compared with the “model”.


All these vast improvements are introduced to the detriment of
the workers, for they lead to their still greater oppression and
exploitation. Moreover, this rational and efficient distribution of labour
is confined to each factory.  

The question naturally arises: What about the distribution of labour in
society as a whole? What a vast amount of labour is wasted at present owing
to the disorganised and chaotic character of capitalist production as a
whole! How much time is wasted as the raw materials pass to the factory
through the hands of hundreds of buyers and middlemen, while the
requirements of the market are unknown! Not only time, but the actual
products are wasted and damaged. And what about the waste of time and
labour in delivering the finished goods to the consumers through a host of
small middlemen who, too, cannot know the requirements of their customers
and perform not only a host of superfluous movements, but also make a host
of superfluous purchases, journeys, and so on and so forth!  

Capital organises and rationalises labour within the factory for the
purpose of increasing the exploitation of the workers and increasing
profit. In social production as a whole, however, chaos continues to reign
and grow, leading to crises when the accumulated wealth cannot find
purchasers, and millions of workers starve because they are unable to find
employment.  
 

The Taylor system—without its initiators knowing or wishing it—is
preparing the time when the proletariat will take over all social
production and appoint its own workers’ committees for the purpose of
properly distributing and rationalising all social labour. Large-scale
production, machinery, railways, telephone—all provide thousands of
opportunities to cut by three-fourths the working time of the organised
workers and make them four times better off than they are today.  

And these workers’ committees, assisted by the workers’ unions, will be
able to apply these principles of rational distribution of social labour
when the latter is freed from its enslavement by capital.

The newspapers have already had a good deal to say about
the conference held on March 1 between government spokes men and certain
members of the Duma; however, the importance of this conference as far as
the position and aims of the “opposition” in the Duma is concerned, has
not by any means been sufficiently highlighted.  

We would remind our readers that just before March 1 a number of
liberal newspapers in St. Petersburg, Moscow and the provinces, raised and
animatedly discussed the general question of a Duma in the doldrums, the
Duma’s impotence and lifelessness, of members fleeing from the Duma, the
aims of the opposition, and so forth.  

Just before March 1, Milyukov and Shingaryov, the most outstanding
leaders of the “Constitutional-Democratic” Party, came out in the
St. Petersburg and Moscow press against Mr. Struve for his appeals for
“reform of the government”, as well as against the Right-wing Cadet
V. Maklakov for his “pessimistic-optimistic” appeals for an agreement
with the Octobrists. Just before March 1, Mr. Milyukov did his utmost to
pose as an opponent of Vekhism, i.e., of consistent and avowed
counter-revolutionary
     liberalism.[1]


The composition and the character of the March 1 Conference proved once
again that all the flimsy reservations made by the
Constitutional-Democratic Party leaders against P. Struve and V. Maklakov,
all their efforts to pose as being “more Left” than the aforesaid
politicians, are sheer hypocrisy

    

and an attempt to hoodwink democrats. In actual fact it was the
policy of the Vekhists among the liberals that triumphed at this
conference, the policy of Struve and V. Maklakov, not of Messrs. Milyukov,
Shingaryov and Co., the Constitutional-Democratic Party’s official leaders
and diplomats.  

The conference was attended only by representatives of the government
parties and of the liberal-bourgeois opposition; neither the
Social-Democrats nor the Trudoviks (bourgeios
democrats) were invited (on the pretext that they are “anti-militarists on
principle, and always vote against all war credits”. The real reason,
however, is that the sponsors did not want to receive a reasoned and public
refusal, which would certainly have been forthcoming, at least from the
Social-Democrats).  

When the opposition members—according to a most official report in
Rech—“attempted to raise the question of our domestic
policies” they were told that the only question that could be
discussed was that of war credits, and that “government spokesmen do not
deem it possible at this conference to make any statements on questions
concerning domestic policies”.  

“Nevertheless,” wrote fleck, “several deputies,
among them I. N. Yefremov, A. I. Shingaryov and others, did, in
their speeches, touch upon questions concerning the internal
situation.”  

So much the more irrelevant, ridiculous, absurd and
undignified, it must be said concerning this statement, was the role played
by the Cadet, Constitutional-Democratic, deputies. Were their party called
the Moderate Liberal-Monarchist Party, i.e., a name truly expressing its
class nature and its real political character, the conduct of the
Constitutional-Democratic deputies would have been quite normal from the
party point of view. But for people who wish to be considered democrats,
for people among whom even such Right-wingers as V. Maklakov publicly
declare that they have lost faith “in the possibility of a way
being found out of the impasse without revolutionary upheavals and
cataclysms” (this is exactly how Mr. Shingaryov himself expounded
V. Maklakov’s views in Rech No. 55, for February 26; and
Mr. Milyukov himself wrote in the same vein in the issue of

    

that paper for February 25)—for such people, participation in a
conference with the Rights and Octobrists was a public slap in the face.


The Constitutional-Democrats slapped their own faces. By participating
in the conference they publicly repudiated their own statements about their
“loss of faith”. They publicly demonstrated their readiness to prove that
their faith was alive, and this is tantamount to readiness to
serve and be subservient.  

Trust the Cadets to understand perfectly both the inseverable
connection that exists between home and foreign policies and the
significance of “allocating credits”....

## The Break-Up of the “August” Bloc

The Break-Up of the “August” Bloc

All who are interested in the working-class movement and
Marxism in Russia know that a bloc of the liquidators, Trotsky, the Letts,
the Bundists and the Caucasians was formed in August 1912.  

The formation of this bloc was announced with tremendous ballyhoo in
the newspaper Luch, which was founded in St. Petersburg—not with
workers’ money—just when the elections were being held, in order to
sabotage the will of the majority of the organised workers. It went into raptures
over the bloc’s “large membership”, over the alliance of “Marxists of
different trends”, over “unity” and non-factionalism, and it raged
against the “splitters”, the supporters of the January 1912
Conference.[1] 

The question of “unity” was thus presented to thinking workers in a
new and practical light. The facts were to show who was right: those who
praised the “unity” platform and tactics of the August bloc members, or
those who said that this was a false signboard, a new disguise for the old,
bankrupt liquidators.  

Exactly eighteen months passed. A tremendous period
considering the upsurge of 1912–13. And then, in February 1914, a new
journal—this time eminently “unifying” and eminently and truly
“non-factional”—bearing the title Borba, was founded by
Trotsky, that “genuine” adherent of the August platform.  

Both the contents of Borba’s issue No. 1 and what the
liquidators wrote about that journal before it appeared, at once revealed
to the attentive observer that the August bloc had broken up and
that frantic efforts were being made to conceal this and hoodwink the
workers. But this fraud will also be exposed very soon.  
 

Before the appearance of Borba, the editors of Severnaya
Rabochaya
Gazeta[2] published a scathing comment stating:
“The real physiognomy of this journal, which has of late been spoken of
quite a lot in Marxist circles, is still unclear to us.”  

Think of that, reader: since August 1912 Trotsky has been considered a
leader of the August unity bloc; but the whole of 1913 shows him to have
been dissociated from Luch and the Luchists. In 1914, this
selfsame Trotsky establishes his own journal, while continuing
fictitiously on the staff of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta and
Nasha Zarya. “There is a plod deal of talk in circles”
about a secret “memorandum”—which the liquidators are keeping
dark—written by Trotsky against the Luchists, Messrs. F. D.,
L. M., and similar “strangers”.  

And yet the truthful, non-factional and unifying Editorial Board of
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta writes: “Its physiognomy is still
unclear to us!”  

It is not yet clear to them that the August bloc has fallen apart!


No, Messrs. F. D., L. M. and other Luchists, it is perfectly “clear”
to you, and you are simply deceiving the workers.  

The August bloc—as we said at the time, in August 1912—turned out
to be a mere screen for the liquidators. That bloc has fallen
asunder. Even its friends in Russia have not been able to
stick together. The famous uniters even failed to unite themselves and we
got two “August” trends, the Luchist trend (Nasha Zarya
and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta) and the Trotskyist trend
(Borba). Both are waring scraps of the “general and united”
August banner which they have torn up, and both are shouting themselves
hoarse with cries of “unity”!  

What is Borba’s trend? Trotsky wrote a verbose article in
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 11, explaining this, but the
editors of that liquidator newspaper very pointedly re plied that its
“physiognomy is still unclear”.  

The liquidators do have their own physiognomy, a liberal, not
a Marxist one. Anyone familiar with the writings of F. D., L. S., L. M.,
Yezhov,[3] Potresov and Co. is familiar with this physiognomy.  
 

Trotsky, however, has never had any “physiognomy” at all; the only
thing he does have is a habit of changing sides, of skipping from the
liberals to the Marxists and back again, of mouthing scraps of catchwords
and bombastic parrot phrases.  

In Borba you will not find a single live word on any
controversial issue.  

This is incredible, but it is a fact.  

The question of the “underground”? Not a word.  

Does Trotsky share the views of Axelrod, Zasulich, F. D.,
L. S. (Luch No. 101) and so forth? Not a murmur.  

The slogan of fighting for an open party? Not a single word.


The liberal utterances of the Yezhovs and other Luchists on strikes?
The annulment of the programme on the national question? Not a
murmur.  

The utterances of L. Sedov and other Luchists against two of
the
“pillars”[4]? Not a murmur. Trotsky assures us that he is in
favour of combining immediate demands with ultimate aims, but there is not
a word as to his attitude towards the liquidator method of
effecting this “combination”!  

Actually, under cover of high-sounding, empty, and obscure phrases that
confuse the non-class-conscious workers, Trotsky is defending the
liquidators by passing over in silence the question of the “underground”,
by asserting that there is no liberal-labour policy in Russia, and the
like.  

Trotsky delivers a long lecture to the seven Duma deputies, headed by
Chkheidze, instructing them how to repudiate the “underground” and the
Party in a more subtle manner. This amusing lecture clearly points
to the further break-up of the Seven. Buryanov has left them. They
were unable to see eye to eye in their reply to Plekhanov. They are now
oscillating between Dan and Trotsky, while Chkheidze is evidently
exercising his diplomatic talents in an effort to paper over the new
cracks.  

And these near-Party people, who are unable to unite on their
own “August” platform, try to deceive the workers with their
shouts about “unity”! Vain efforts!  

Unity means recognising the “old” and combating those who repudiate
it. Unity means rallying the majority of the workers in Russia about
decisions which have long been

    

known, and which condemn liquidationism. Unity means that members of the
Duma must work in harmony with the will of the majority of the workers,
which the six workers’ deputies are doing.  

But the liquidators and Trotsky, the Seven and Trotsky, who tore up
their own August bloc, who flouted all the decisions of the Party and
dissociated themselves from the “underground” as well as from the
organised workers, are the worst splitters. Fortunately, the workers have
already realised this, and all class-conscious workers are creating their
own real unity against the liquidator disruptors of
unity.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of
the R. S. D. L. P. held in Prague on January 5–17 (18–30), 1912,
which virtually played the role of a Party congress.  

Over twenty Party organisations were represented at the Conference,
which was also attended by representatives of the Editorial Board of the
Central Organ Sotsial-Demokrat, the Editorial Board of
Rabochaya Gazeta, the Committee of the Organisation Abroad, and
the Transport Group of the Central Committee of the R. S. D. L. P. With the
exception of two pro-Party Mensheviks, the delegates were Bolsheviks. Among
the delegates were G. K. Orjonikidze of the Tiflis organisation,
S. S. Spandaryan of Baku, Y. P. Onufriev of St. Petersburg, and
F. I. Goloshchokin of Moscow. The Committee of the Organisation Abroad was
represented by N. A. Semashko, and the Transport Group of the C.C. by
I. A. Pyatnitsky.  

Lenin represented the Editorial Board of the Central Organ.  

The Conference was conducted by Lenin, who, at the opening, spoke on
the constitution of the Conference, made reports on the current situation
and the tasks of the Party, and the work of the International Socialist
Bureau, and took p art in the debates on the work of the Central Organ, the
tasks of the Social-Democrats

   

in combating famine, on the organisational question, the work of the Party
organisation abroad, and other questions. Lenin drafted resolutions on all
the important questions standing on the agenda.  

Lenin’s report on “The Tasks of the Party in the Present Situation”
and the corresponding resolution of the Conference gave a profound analysis
of the political situation within the country, and showed that
revolutionary sentiment among the masses was running high. The Conference
emphasised that the task of the conquest of power by the proletariat, who
led the peasantry, remained that of a democratic revolution in Russia.


The most important task of the Conference was to rid the Party of the
opportunists. Its resolutions on “Liquidationism and the Group of
Liquidators” and on “The Party Organisation Abroad” were of tremendous
significance in point of principle and practice. The liquidators were
grouped around two legal journals—Nasha Zarya and Dyelo
Zhizni. The Conference declared that, “by their behaviour, the
Nasha Zarya and Dyelo Zhizni group had placed themselves
irretrievably beyond the pale of the Party”. The liquidators were expelled
from the R. S. D. L. P. The Conference condemned the activities of the
anti-Party groups abroad—the Menshevik Golos group, the
Vperyod group and the Trotskyists. The existence abroad of a
united Party organisation working for the Party under the control and
guidance of the Central Committee was recognised as an absolute necessity
by the Conference, which pointed out that the groups abroad “which do not
submit to the Social-Democratic centre in Russia, that is, the Central
Committee, and which introduce disorganisation by establishing special
contacts with Russia over the head of the C. C., cannot speak on behalf of
the R. S. D. L. P.” These resolutions played a tremendous role in
strengthening the unity of the Marxist party in Russia.  

One of the highlights of the Conference was the question of
participation in the Fourth Duma election campaign. The Conference stressed
that the chief task of the Party at the elections and of the
Social-Democratic group in the Duma itself was socialist class propaganda
and the organisation of the working class. Basic minimum-programme demands
for a democratic republic, an eight-hour day, and confiscation of all
landed estates were advanced by the Conference as the Party’s principal
election slogans.  

The Conference adopted a resolution on “The Character and
Organisational Forms of Party Work”, endorsed the changes in the Party
Rules proposed by Lenin, confirmed Sotsial-Demokrat in its status,
of the Party’s Central Organ, elected a Central Committee of the Party, and
set up a Russian Bureau of the Central Committee.  

The Prague Conference of the R. S. D. L. P. played an outstanding part
in building up the Bolshevik Party, a party of a new type. It summed up the
entire historical phase of the Bolsheviks’ struggle against the Mensheviks,
and consolidated the Bolsheviks’ victory. The Menshevik liquidators were
expelled from the Party. The

   

local Party organisations rallied around the decisions of the Conference,
which strengthened the Party as an all-Russia organisation. The political
line and tactics of the Party under the conditions of a new revolutionary
upswing were laid down. Purged of the opportunists, the Bolshevik Party
took the lead in the new powerful upsurge of the revolutionary struggle of
the masses. Of great international significance, the Prague Conference gave
the revolutionary elements in the parties of the Second International an
example of determined struggle against opportunism, which it conducted to
the extent of a complete organisational break with the opportunists.

When thieves fall out, honest men come by their own, to
some extent. When bourgeois newspapermen quarrel they reveal to the public
the venality of the “big dailies” and the tricks they are up to.  

N. Snessarev of the Novoye Vremya quarrelled with that
newspaper, misappropriated some of its funds, and was dismissed after a
scandal. He has now published a “book” of 135 pages entitled The
Mirage of “Novoye Vremya”. As Good as a
Novel. St. Petersburg, 1914. Posing, as is the custom, as a “perfect
gentleman”, Mr. Snessarev describes the ethics which have long established
themselves in the capitalist countries of the West, and which are
penetrating more and more into the bourgeois press in Russia, where of
course the soil is exceptionally favourable for the most sordid and
disgusting forms of bribery, toadyism, etc., which are practised with
impunity.  

“Everybody has gradually become accustomed to live beyond his means,”
this Novoye Vremya man writes with a charming air of “injured
innocence”. “When and how society will rid itself of this phenomenon, or
whether it will rid itself of it at all, nobody can tell. But that such is
the situation at the present time is a recognised fact.” And one of the
magic means by which one can live above one’s income is to get bourgeois
newspapers to “participate” in promoting concessions. “I could
mention scores of different concessions,” relates our Novoya
Vremya-ist, “which owe their existence, not only to certain
connections, but also to certain articles published in certain
newspapers. Novoye Vremya is of course no exception.” For
example, one day, a representative of the London Marconi Wireless Telegraph
Company called on Mr. Snessarev and invited him to draft the Articles of
Association

    

of a Russian Marconi Co. and a plan for a concession for that
Company. “The remuneration for this work was fixed at 10,000 rubles, and
an agreement was reached.”  

The “victimised” Snessarev relates that, not only did he sell himself
to the capitalists for this sum, but that the whole newspaper Novoye
Vremya sold itself to conduct “a campaign in favour of the
concession”, for which it received a 50 per cent rebate on telegrams, a
“cushy job” as a founder of the Company, and a grant of 50,000 rubles’
worth of shares.  

London capitalists—fleecing the Russians—concessions from the
Russian Government—press participation—whole sale corruption—anybody
and everybody, bought and sold for thousands of rubles—such is the
truthful picture revealed by the disgruntled crook Snessarev.  

Novoye Vremya, an enterprise with millions invested in it, was
collapsing. The pampered sons of the renegade millionaire A. S. Suvorin
were squandering and dissipating millions. This noble newspaper had to be
saved. “P. L. Bark, Managing Director of the Volga-Kama Bank, appeared on
the scene” (p. 85). He persuaded A. S. Suvorin to transfer the business to
a company, whose Articles, of Association had received His
Majesty’s approval in August 1911. Of the eight hundred shares (at
5,000 rubles per share), 650 went to A. S. Suvorin. In forming the Company
they drew up a fictitious balance-sheet, Mr. Snessarev explains (p. 97),
adding that “such a balance-sheet could have been accepted either by
people totally ignorant of figures, or by people like Mr. Guchkov, that is
to say, people who know their business perfectly, but pursue aims of their
own”. The heroes of this Company’s inauguration (the inaugural meeting was
held on November 10, 1911) were Snessarev himself, P. L. Bark,
V. P. Burenin, Octobrist member of the Duma Shubinsky, the sons of that
noble renegade A. S. Suvorin, and others.  

As the reader sees, this highly respectable Company has been operating
with great zeal since November 1911, but since 1912, the
“victimised” Snessarev informs us, Novoye Vremya has been
receiving a subsidy in the shape of the advertisements of the Land Banks
(“not a very great income—a mere 15,000 rubles per annum, or “something
round about that” figure!). According to the law, these advertisements

    

had to be given to the newspaper with the largest circulation. At that time
Novoye Vremya did not have the largest circulation, but
it “set in motion” (“for the first time”, the noble Snessarev avows)
its backstairs influence and connections in government circles in order to
retain these Land Bank advertisements. “The matter was discussed by the
Council of Ministers and after rather serious hesitation it was decided to
allow Novoye Vremya to retain the advertisements” (p. 21).  

A literary and art society’s club, “in plain words, a gambling-house”
(p. 69) was formed; “in the club’s debt book the members of the staff of
Novoye Vremya had thousands of rubles against their
accounts. These debts were simply written off”.  

In co-operation with Menshikov and others, the stock broker Manus, who
grew rich on the stock exchange and piled up a fortune of “several
millions” (p. 120), launched a campaign in Novoye Vremya
demanding Kokovtsov’s resignation from the Cabinet. We leave it to our
readers to figure out how many thousands each of these “public servants”
received, and how much they have yet coming to them.  

A whirligig of millions began: Novoye Vremya with a balance of
five millions, of which about three millions are fictitious; salaries and
fees of two and three thousand rubles per month to second-rate and
third-rate members of the staff; hundreds of thousands and millions wasted;
loans from banks amounting to hundreds of thousands; universal corruption;
prostitution in all its forms, illegal and legal, sanctified by marriage;
the cream of high St. Petersburg society; millionaires, Cabinet Ministers,
stockbrokers and distinguished foreigners; gambling-houses; blackmail in
different forms; “no political convictions” (p. 36); envy and intrigues;
Amfiteatrov and Snessarev challenging an engineer to a duel for insulting
the editors of Novoye Vremya, who had slung mud at the students;
A. S. Suvorin, “who was very fond” of Amfiteatrov, but “could not deny
himself the pleasure of annoying him”, by letting through an article by
Burenin containing a “nasty” dig at the actress Raiskaya, Amfiteatrov’s
wife; Burenin kicks Amfiteatrov out; Suvorin’s scapegrace sons run up debts
amounting to hundreds of thousands of rubles.  

Novoye Vremya’s loss in 1905—150,000 rubles.  
 

Scared by 1905, Moscow merchants and manufacturers gave 100,000 rubles
to found a patriotic newspaper for workers. At their request Novoye
Vremya undertook to arrange the matter.  

The newspaper “dragged out a miserable existence” for two years and
then closed down. Muscovites lost 100,000 rubles, and the Novoye
Vremya people 150,000 rubles (p. 61).  

Thieves, male prostitutes, venal writers, venal newspapers. Such is our
“big press”. Such is the flower of our “high” society. “Everybody”
knows these people; they have connections “everywhere”... The brazen
Insolence of feudalists embracing in the dark with the brazen corruption of
the bourgeoisie—such is “Holy Russia”.

It is sometimes useful to see how people judge us, our
workers’ press, our workers’ unions, our working-class movement, from
outside. It is instructive to know the views of our enemies, both
overt and covert, the views of indefinite people and indefinite
“sympathisers”, if they are at all intelligent and have some idea of
polities.  

Under the latter category undoubtedly comes the “Trudovik” or
“Popular Socialist”—or, if the truth were to be told, just the ordinary
radical bourgeois or bourgeois democrat—Mr. S. Yelpatievsky.  

This writer is a staunch supporter and associate of N. K. Mikhailovsky,
now the object of fulsome praise from the “Left Narodniks”, who, in
defiance of common sense, are trying to pass themselves off as
socialists. Mr. S. Yelpatievsky is a close observer of the life of the
Russian man in the street, to whose moods he is so “sensitive”.  

He may well be called one of Russia’s leading liquidators, seeing that
he and his friends, as far back as in the autumn of 1906 (see the ill-famed
August issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo for 1906), proclaimed the need
for an “open party”, attacked the narrow-mindedness of the
“underground”, and started to touch up the most important slogans of this
“underground” in the spirit of an open, that is to say, legal, party. In
word, and in the minds of these “Social-Cadets” (as even the
Left Narodniks were obliged to call them at the time), their
repudiation of the “underground” and their liquidationist proclamation of
an “open party” or “struggle for an open party”, were prompted by the
desire “to go among the masses”, to organise the masses.  

In deed, however, the plan of the “Popular Socialists” contained
nothing but philistine, petty-bourgeois faint-heartedness

    

(in regard to the masses) and credulity (in regard to the authorities). For
their advocacy of an “open party” some of them were threatened with the
lock-up and some were kept there, and as a result, they remained without
any contact with the masses, open or otherwise, and without a party of any
kind, open or otherwise. They remained what our liquidators now are,
namely, a group of liquidator legalists, a group of “independent” writers
(independent of the “under ground”, but ideologically dependent, on
liberalism).  

The period of despondency, collapse and disintegration has passed. New
currents are stirring, and Mr. S. Yelpatievsky, who is so sensitive to
man-in-the-street moods, has writ ten an article, published in this year’s
January issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo, on the moods of the different
classes in Russian society. The article bears the pretentious title “Life
Goes On”.  

Life goes on, our Narodnik exclaims, calling to mind all kinds of
congresses, Salazkin’s
speech[1] and the Beilis case. Things are undoubtedly stirring in the
provinces, although “it is sometimes difficult now to distinguish, not
only the Right Cadet from the Left Octobrist, but the
Socialist-Revolutionary and the Social-Democrat [you mean liquidator
Social-Democrat, don’t you, Mr. Narodnik liquidator?] from the Left Cadet,
judging by local [and, of course, exclusively legal] tactics”. “Something
like a unification of Rus is taking place on either side of the wall
dividing, Russia. On one side have rallied the united aristocracy, the
united bureaucracy, the civil servants and other folk who ‘live on the
Treasury’; on the other side—just the rank and file, the, mass of
provincial society”.  

Our Narodnik’s outlook, as you see, is not broad, and his analysis is
shallow—the same old liberal contraposing of government and society. It
is rather difficult to say anything about the class struggle within
society, about bourgeoisie and workers, about the growing dissension
between liberalism and democracy from the standpoint of the provincial man
in the street.  

It is difficult to draw conclusions about the rural masses, writes
Mr. S. Yelpatievsky.  

“Darkness and silence hung over the countryside,
   where it was difficult to see anything an from where it was hard to hear
   anything”....

    

   The co-operative movement “suddenly burst forth, spreading far and
   wide”... the struggle between the
   otrub[2] and the commune peasants ... “all this did not
   stand out clearly enough”.  

   “Admittedly, the wall that is being flung up between the
   otrub and the commune peasants as a result of the government’s
   efforts to divide and split the rural masses is rising higher and higher,
   but the countryside has evidently not yet produced the feeling and
   sentiment suitable to the government’s aims. The desire for and expectation
   of land still continue to burn brightly in the hearts of both, and the
   desire for freedom, for ‘rights’, which was formerly obscured by the
   ‘land’, is evidently becoming increasingly stronger and more compelling.”
   


After observing that “it is the Right-wing circles that are now
persistently repeating the word revolution”, that these circles “are
really scared, really expect a conflict, and are convinced that a
catastrophe is unavoidable”, our chronicler of Russian life ends up by
saying this about the workers: 


   “I need not say anything here about the organised
   workers. There is no need to grope there for one’s
   conclusions—everything there is clear and visible to
   all. Opinions there are fairly definitely established, there ate
   not only desires and expectations there, but also demands, reinforced by
   volitional impulses—not sporadic outbreaks, but systematised and fairly
   well developed methods.... [The dots are Mr. Yelpatievsky’s.] And,
   undoubtedly, opinions, desires and expectations percolate from this
   organised environment into the rural environment from which it
   sprang.”  


This was written by a man who has never been a Marxist and has always
stood aloof from the “organised workers”. And this appraisal of things
from outside is all the more valuable to the class-conscious
workers.  

Mr. Yelpatievsky, one of the “foremost” leaders of liquidationism,
would do well to ponder over the implications of the admission he has been
obliged to make.  

For one thing, among which workers does he find “fairly
definitely established opinions” and “fairly well developed and
systematised methods”? Only among the opponents of liquidationism
(because, among the liquidators themselves, there is complete chaos in
opinions and methods); only among those who have not hurried
faint-heartedly to turn their backs on the “underground”. Only
among these, indeed, “everything is clear and visible to
all”. Paradoxically enough, it is a fact that chaos reigns among
those who yearn for an “open party”, that “everything is clear and
visible to all”, that “opinions are fairly definitely established and
methods

    

fairly well developed” only among the adherents of the “underground”,
among those who are faithful to the precepts of this allegedly bigoted and
hidebound “underground” (cf. Nasha Zarya, Luch,
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta).


The first to give birth to liquidationism (Mr. Yelpatievsky, leader of
Russkoye Bogatstvo) was the first to sign its death warrant and
read the burial service at its grave.  

Although Mr. Yelpatievsky himself may not be aware of it, the question
he raises is far beyond the understanding of certain politicians.  

Secondly—and this is most important of all—why is it that in one of
the most turbulent and difficult periods of Russian history, in the five
years 1908-13, the proletariat was the only class of all the
classes in the Russian nation that did not “grope” its way about? Why was
it only among the proletariat that “everything is clear and visible to
all”? Why is the proletariat emerging from the state of utter ideological
disintegration and collapse and vacillation in matters concerning
programme, tactics and organisation—such as now reign among the liberals,
the Narodniks and intellectualist “would-be Marxists”—with “opinions
fairly definitely established” and with “methods systematised and fairly
well developed”? It is not only because these opinions were established
and these methods developed by the “underground”, but because there are
profound social causes, economic conditions and factors which are operating
more and more effectively with every new mile of railway that is built, and
with every advance that is made in trade, industry and capitalism in town
and countryside, factors which increase, strengthen, steel and unite the
proletariat and keep it from following the lead of the man in the
street, keep it from wavering like philistines, from faint-heartedly
renouncing the “underground”.  

Those who ponder on this will realise the enormous harm that is caused
by attempts to “fuse” into a single party the advanced members of the
wage-worker class and the inevitably wavering and unstable petty-bourgeois
peasantry.  

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the speech made by the millionaire merchant
A. S. Salazkin, President of the Nizhni-Novgorod Fair and Exchange
Committee, at a special meeting of the Committee held on August 16(29),
1913 in connection with the visit to the Fair of Prime Minister
Kokovtsov. On behalf of all Russia’s merchants Salazkin urged upon
Kokovtsov the “vital necessity” of radical political reforms on the basis
of the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17, 1905, and expressed the desire of
the commercial and industrial world “to take a direct part in the affairs
of public self-government and state organisation”.  

Lenin repeatedly referred to this speech in his articles. (See “The
Russian Bourgeoisie and Russian Reformism”, “The Merchant Salazkin and
the Writer F. D.” and “Questions of Principle in Politics”, present
edition, Vol. 19.)

Otrub peasants—those who received an otrub (a
homestead). Under Stolypin’s Law of November 9, 1906, the village communes
were obliged to endow the peasants leaving the commune with an allotment in
one place.

Some time ago, the Council of State rejected the proposal
that Polish should abe the official language in the future self-governing
Poland. This vote, which took place against the wishes of the head of the
Ministry, throws considerable light on the question of Russia’s master
classes and on the “specific features” of our political system and
administration.  

The long history of the Polish language question in connection with
Polish self-government has been highlighted in the press. The Russian
landlords, who are at the helm of the state, started negotiations with the
Polish aristocracy on this question a long time ago, as far back as
1907. The terms were discussed for at least co-operation, or simply a
relatively peaceful cohabitation between the Russian Black Hundreds and the
Polish Black Hundreds. And all this was done; of course, entirely and
solely in the interests of the “national culture”.  

Polish national culture was defended by the Polish landlords, who
bargained for self-government (instead of autonomy) and for Polish as the
official language. Russian national culture was defended by the
Great-Russian landlords, who stipulated (possessing everything, they had no
need to bar gain) supremacy for Russian national culture and the severance
from Poland of the “Russian” Holm area. The two parties made a deal,
which, among other things, was directed against the Jews, whom
they reduced in advance to a restrictive “numerus clausus”, so
that Poland should not lag be hind Russia in Black-Hundred baiting and
oppression of the Jews.  

Stolypin is reported to have conducted these negotiations with the
Polish aristocracy, the land magnates of Poland, in person. Stolypin made
promises. The bills were introduced.

    

But ... the Holm area found itself detached from Poland, whereas the Polish
language in a self-governing Poland was rejected by our Council of
State. Stolypin’s cause was “faithfully and truly” championed by
Kokovtsov, but with out avail. The Right members of the Council of State
did not support him.  

Here is another agreement, although a minor one, that was “torn
up”. Recently, Guchkov stated in the name of the all-Russian bourgeoisie
that the latter had entered into a tacit agreement with the
counter-revolutionary government “to support it in return for
reforms”. The support was given, but no reforms ensued.  

In the example we have quoted, it was not the bourgeoisie, not the
opposition, but the blue-blooded landlords who concluded what was also a
tacit agreement, viz., “we” shall take a step towards Stolypin, and shall
receive self-government, with the Polish language. They took the step, but
received no Polish language.  

Valuable, political lessons are to be learnt from this small
example. The struggle of nationalities is developing before our eyes into a
deal between the ruling classes of two nations, in which special provision
is made for the oppression of a third nation (the Jewish). We must not
forget that all ruling classes, the bourgeoisie as well as the landlords,
even the most democratic bourgeoisie, behave in the same way.  

Russia’s real political system and administration are revealed in their
class basis: the landlords give the orders; they decide and rule. The power
of this class is supreme. It gives the bourgeoisie “access” ... only to
agreements, which it tears up.  

Nor is that all. It appears that even within the master class
itself agreements are “torn up” with extraordinary and supernatural
ease. This is what distinguishes Russia from other class states; this
constitutes our exceptionalism, under which problems resolved in Europe two
hundred or a hundred years ago are still unresolved here.

Comrades: 

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma has decided to
introduce in the Fourth Duma a Bill to abolish the disabilities of the Jews
and other non-Russians. The text of this Bill you will find below.  

The Bill aims at abolishing all national restrictions against all
nations: Jews, Poles, and so forth But it deals in particular detail with
the restrictions against the Jews. The reason is obvious: no nationality in
Russia is so oppressed and persecuted as the Jewish. Anti-Semitism is
striking ever deeper root among the propertied classes. The Jewish workers
are suffering under a double yoke, both as workers and as Jews. During the
past few years, the persecution of the Jews has assumed incredible
dimensions. It is sufficient to recall the anti-Jewish pogroms and the
Beilis case.  

In view of these circumstances, organised Marxists must devote proper
attention to the Jewish question.  

It goes without saying that the Jewish question can effectively be
solved only together with the fundamental issues confronting Russia
today. Obviously, we do not look to the nationalist-Purishkevich Fourth
Duma to abolish the restrictions against the Jews and other
non-Russians. But it is the duty of the working class to make its voice
heard. And the voice of the Russian workers must be particularly
loud in protest against national oppression.  

In publishing the text of our Bill, we hope that the Jewish workers,
the Polish workers, and the workers of the other oppressed nationalities
will express their opinion of it and propose amendments, should they deem
it necessary.  

At the same time we hope that the Russian workers will give
particularly strong support to our Bill by their declarations, etc.  
 

In conformity with Article 4 we shall append to the Bill a special list
of regulations and laws to be rescinded. This appendix will cover about a
hundred such laws affecting the Jews alone.  
 A BILL for the ABOLITION of all DISABILITIES of the JEWS and of all
RESTRICTIONS on the GROUNDS of ORIGIN or NATIONALITY

1.
Citizens of all nationalities inhabiting Russia are equal before the law.


2.
No citizen of Russia, regardless of sex and religion, may be restricted in
political or in any other rights on the grounds of origin or nationality.


3.
All and any laws, provisional regulations, riders to laws, and so forth,
which impose restrictions upon Jews in any sphere of social and political
life, are herewith abolished. Article 767, Vol. IX, which states that
“Jews are subject to the general laws in all cases where no special
regulations affecting them, have been issued” is herewith
repealed. All and any restrictions of the rights of Jews as regards
residence and travel, the right to education, the right to state and public
employment, electoral rights, military service, the right to purchase and
rent real estate in towns, villages. etc., are herewith abolished, and all
restrictions of the rights of Jews to engage in the liberal professions,
etc., are herewith abolished.  

4.
To the present law is appended a list of the laws, orders, provisional
regulations, etc., that limit the tights of the Jews, and which are subject
to repeal.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The National Equality Bill (official title of the “Bill for
the Abolition of All Disabilities of the Jews and of all Restrictions on
the Grounds of Origin or Nationality”) was drafted by Lenin for the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Fourth Duma. This Bill was to
have been introduced in the Duma, apparently in connection with the
discussion of the Ministry of the Interior’s budget.  

In publishing this Bill on behalf of the R. S. D. L. group, Lenin
considered it a point of honour on the part of the Russian workers to
support it with tens of thousands of signatures and declarations. “This,”
said Lenin, “will he the best means of consolidating complete
unity, amalgamating all the workers of Russia, irrespective

   

of nationality. (See the article “National Equality”, pp. 237–38 of this
volume.)

Wages in the manufacturing industry are known to have risen
by about twenty per cent since 1905.  

A first attempt to study the situation as regards the wages of
agricultural labourers was made in the recently published pamphlet
by I. Drozdov, The Wages of Farm Labourers in Russia in Connection with
the Agrarian Movement in 1905–06 (St. Petersburg, 1914, published by
M. I. Semyonov, price 50 kopeks). We shall deal with the main conclusions
of this interesting treatise.  

The farm labourer’s average daily wage in European Russia was as
follows (in kopeks): 





 
Kopeks
Per cent




Average for 1902–04 . . . . .    
64.0
100.0


” ” 1905 . . . . . 
64.8
101.2


” ” 1906 . . . . . 
72.0
112.5


” ” 1907 . . . . . 
73.1
114.2


” ” 1908 . . . . . 
72.4
113.1


” ” 1909 . . . . . 
75.8
118.4


” ” 1910 . . . . . 
76.6
119.6




These figures show that the highest increase in wages occurred in 1906,
the very year when the impact of the 1905 movement must have been at its
strongest.  

Thus, beginning with 1905, an increase was achieved also in the
incredibly low pay of farm labourers! That this progress is still far from
adequate is evident from a comparison between money wages and grain
prices. The author of the pamphlet made this comparison and expressed the
money wages of farm labourers quoted above in terms of grain (rye)
at average local prices. He found that wages expressed in terms of grain
dropped from 0.93 poods in 1902-04 to 0.85 poods in 1905 and 0.91
poods in 1906.  
 

In other words, for his day’s pay the farm labourer in Russia could buy
0.93 poods of rye in 1902–04 and only 0.91 poods in 1906. Obviously, if
not for the impetus of 1905 and 1906, the reduction in real wages
would have been even greater.  

Wages fluctuate considerably from year to year according to the harvest
and other causes. For example, between 1905 and 1907 wages rose, though
very unevenly, and then in 1908 (the year when the reaction was strongest)
they dropped, to rise slightly again in 1909 and 1910.  

In view of the fluctuation of wages from year to year, it is necessary
to take for the purposes of comparison, not individual years, but
decades. Making such a comparison, Mr. Drozdov defines the average wage of
farm labourers in European Russia for the ten years 1891–1900 at 55.08
kopeks per day, and for the subsequent ten years (1901–10) at 69.18 kopeks
per day. This shows an increase of 25.5 per cent.  

This means that three million farm labourers in Russia (the
number is undoubtedly greatly understated) secured increases in pay
amounting to about eighty million rubles per year, if we count
only 200 working days per year.  

True, during this period, the price of food products increased on an
average by 20.5 per cent. Hence, the actual increase in wages, or
increase in real wages, was very slight. Expressing daily money wages in
terms of grain, the author found an increase of only 3.9 per cent during
the revolutionary ten years as compared with, the pre-revolutionary ten
years. Thus, by exerting all their efforts the labourers succeeded in
keeping wages at their former level and in raising them only
very slightly.  

On the other hand, a comparison of the changes in labourers’ wages and
in the price of land during the same two decades reveals an
enormous increase in the incomes of the landed
gentry. Purchasing land means purchasing the income obtained
from the land; it means purchasing rent; the price of land is
therefore capitalised rent. We see that during the two decades the average
price per dessiatine rose from R. 69.1 to R. 132.4, i.e., almost
doubled!  

The wages of millions of hired workers increased by
one-fourth. The incomes of the landlords doubled. Wages
barely kept pace with the price of food products, but the landlords’

    

incomes rose five times as high as the price of food products. The
landowners and well-to-do peasant proprietors are growing steadily
richer.  

It should be borne in mind that the increase in the income from land
and the increaso in the price of agricultural
produce steadily and inevitably widen the class gulf between the rural
bourgeois and the rural proletarian, between the small proprietor
(albeit a “labouring” proprietor) and the wage-worker. Therefore, those
who say to the “labouring” peasants:
under capitalism your small farm will not save you from poverty and want,
your only salvation lies in joining the hired workers—speak the
truth. But those who, like our “Narodniks”, try to defend the interests
of the “labouring” peasant economy and declare that petty
economy is viable under capitalism—such people foster bourgeois
aspirations, cultivate the bourgeois, non-proletarian “streak” in the
small proprietor, and speak like bourgeois.

Workers who read the liquidationist press know how often
the Russian liquidators have boasted about the Lettish Marxist workers
being on their side. When the liquidators split the Social-Democratic group
in the Duma, they also repeatedly referred to the Letts. “Nobody would
think of accusing the Lettish Social-Democratic workers of repudiating the
‘underground’,” they wrote, “and yet these Lettish workers are on our
side.”  

Those who knew the facts never doubted that the liquidators were
... deviating from the truth. When the question of the Six and the Seven
came up for discussion, the overwhelming majority of these Lettish workers
declared in favour of the Six. Pravda published scores of
resolutions passed by many hundreds of Lettish Social-Democratic workers
and quite a number of groups in Riga, Mitau, Libau, and other centres, in
defence of the stand taken by the six workers’ deputies. Next after
St. Petersburg, the city that expressed itself most emphatically on this
question was Riga, that important Lettish working-class centre. The
resolutions passed by the overwhelming majority of Riga workers breathed a
spirit of ardent devotion to the ideas of consistent Marxism, and of
sincere indignation with the liquidators.  

But one thing is true: eager support for the liquidators and their
Seven came from the Lettish “leadership”. The Lettish newspaper, which
was then controlled by the liquidators, published articles against the Six
which, by their scandalous tone and liquidationist content, put them on a
par with the articles published in the St. Petersburg organ of the Russian
liquidators.  
 

True, only a very insignificant number of the Lettish workers
supported the liquidationist campaign. The “leading” body, however, was
on the side of the liquidators, and they continued to speak “on behalf
of” the Lettish organised proletariat....  

But some time elapsed; and representatives of all Lettish Marxist
workers
met.[1] Naturally, the question of the split in the Duma
Social-Democratic group was a high point in their proceedings. The
“leading” liquidators did everything they possibly could to back the
Seven, or, at least, to get the question shelved. Alas, they
failed. Through their official
representatives[2] the Lettish Social-Democratic workers adopted the
following resolution (we quote it verbatim, except for unavoidable
changes): 

“The split in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma.  

“Representatives of all the Lettish Marxist workers express their
profound regret over the split in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma
and are of the opinion that this split was the inevitable consequence of
the split outside the group, among the Russian Marxists.  

“They emphasise that the unity of the group is essential, and declare
that this unity can be achieved: 

“1)
if unity is based on the decisions adopted by the supreme institutions of
the Marxist body prior to the split in the latter, namely, the
Programme of the Marxist body, its Rules, the London decisions, the
decisions of the all-Russia representative body of the Marxists of December
1908 and of January 1910; 

“2)
if a mode of joint activity is found, which will safeguard the rights of
the minority in the group.  

“The Lettish Marxist workers instruct their leading body to
support all steps towards unity in keeping with the views expressed in this
resolution.”  

Such is the resolution. As the reader will see, its gist is that
recognition of the old Marxist body is made an essential condition
of unity. With those who do not recognise the Programme, Rules, and
decisions of 1907, 1908 and
1910,[3] unity is impossible. That is what the Lettish workers said. And
that is what makes the Lettish resolution so important.  
 

Conciliatory trends were undoubtedly very strong at the Lettish
Congress. The Letts did not want to tell the liquidationist group in the
Duma plainly and bluntly that it was a group of splitters, who were
flouting the will of the workers, and that they ought to resign from the
Duma. They did not want to do that, evidently because the Lettish minority
does not go to the same lengths as the Russian liquidators, and also
because the Letts still have hopes of a possible reconciliation with the
Chkheidze group.  

At all events, the Lettish workers formulated precise and clear
conditions of unity.  

How are the issues that split the group in the Duma resolved from the
point of view of the Lettish resolution?  

The Letts demand, firstly, acceptance of the Programme. This means that
they condemn advocacy of the famous “cultural-national autonomy”
from the Duma rostrum. For the Programme officially rejected this demand,
and even liquidator L. Martov has admitted that “cultural-national
autonomy” is scarcely in keeping with the Programme. If unity is to become
possible, the liquidators must renounce cultural-national autonomy. Such is
the meaning of the Lettish reply to the first point at issue.  

Next comes the dispute about admitting deputy Jagiello into the
group. How do the Lettish workers settle this dispute? They say:
see the decision of December 1908. We take up this document, look and read:


“On amalgamation with the P.S.P. Left-wing.  

“After hearing the proposal of our Menshevik comrades concerning
amalgamation with the P.S.P. Left-wing, the all-Russia representative, body
of the Marxists proceeds without debate to the order of the day.” (See
Report, p. 46.)  

The thing is clear. The all-Russia decision of 1908 flatly rejected the
proposal to amalgamate with Jagiello’s party in any shape or form. The
liquidators violated this decision. Consequently, they must
reverse their splitting decision concerning Jagiello.  

Further, the Letts demand acceptance of all decisions on points of
principle adopted in December 1908 and January 1910. What are these
decisions? And how do they appraise

    

liquidationism? We take the documents concerned and read: 

“Whereas in a number of areas attempts have been observed on the part
of some of the Party intelligentsia to liquidate the ‘underground’ and to
substitute for it an amorphous federation acting at all costs within the
limits of legality, even at the cost of openly abandoning the programme,
tactics and traditions of the Marxist body ... holds that it is
necessary to wage a relentless struggle against the liquidators’
attempts, and calls upon all truly Marxist workers, irrespective of
group or trend, to offer the most strenuous resistance to these attempts.”


This is how the 1908 decisions condemned liquidationism (see p. 38 of
the Report). The Letts demanded acceptance of these decisions.  

Next come the decisions of January 1910. Here we read:
“The historical situation in the Social-Democratic movement in the period
of bourgeois counter-revolution inevitably gives rise—as a
manifestation of the bourgeois influence on the proletariat—to
... repudiation of the illegal Party, belittling of its role and
importance, and attempts to whittle down the programmatic and tactical
tasks and the slogans of the entire body of Marxists.”  

Thus did the decisions of 1910 condemn liquidationism. And it was the
Letts again who demanded recognition of these decisions by the liquidators.


The Lettish resolution was adopted unanimously. Even
the Lettish liquidators who were present dared not vote against it. They
had received a sufficiently severe lesson from the Lettish workers, who
respect the “underground” and recognise the decisions of the old body of
Marxists. To vote against this resolution would have meant defying the
whole Lettish proletariat and losing their last supporters among the
workers.  

Such were the decisions of the Lettish workers (over three thousand
organised workers being represented).  

In a very polite form, without using a single harsh word, but
nonetheless firmly and emphatically, the Lettish workers said to the
Chkheidze group: 

“Do you want unity? Then recognise the extremely important decisions
of the old body of Marxists, retract your

    

violations of the Programme and decisions of 1908–10, repudiate those who
have repudiated the ‘underground’; in short, take your stand on the basis
of Marxism.”  

The last really workers’ organisation, in whose name the Chkheidze
group tried to speak, turned its back on that group. As was to be expected,
only a handful of liquidators now support the seven deputies who are
inclining towards liquidationism. The proletarian element is abandoning or
has already abandoned them.  

A group without workers—such is the liquidationist group in
the Duma.  

After the Letts’ decision, this is now absolutely indisputable.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of
the Lettish Region held on January 13–26 (January 26–February 8), 1914,
in Brussels.  

Lenin, who took an active part in organising and conducting the
Congress, carried on a busy pre-congress correspondence with the Bolsheviks
of Latvia and went to Berlin and Paris to meet them to settle questions
pertaining to preparations for the Congress, its composition, the possible
outcome of the struggle at the Congress, etc. At the Congress Lenin made a
report on the Lettish Social-Democrats’ attitude to the R. S. D. L. P. and
the split in the Duma group, and took part in the meeting of the Bolshevik
delegates, whom he helped with the drafting of resolutions. On the evening
of January 12 (25), 1914, the day before the Congress, Lenin gave a lecture
on the national question to the Congress delegates in Brussels, in which he
expounded the theory and tactics of Bolshevism in the national
question. Lenin called upon the Marxists of Latvia to strengthen real, not
imaginary, unity of the Party, and defend its ranks against the vacillators
and the liquidators, who were openly betraying the cause the working class.


Lenin drew extensively upon the resolutions of the Fourth Congress of
the Lettish Social-Democrats in his struggle against the liquidators and
Trotskyists. (See the articles in this volume: “The Lettish Workers and
the Split in the Social-Democratic Group In the Duma”, “The ‘August’
Fiction Exposed”, “The Liquidators and the Lettish Working-Class
Movement” and others.) As a result of the stiff struggle against
conciliatory tendencies waged at the Congress by Lenin and the Lettish
Bolsheviks, they succeeded in securing the withdrawal of the Lettish
Social-Democrats from the-August bloc. Lenin called this withdrawal a
“deadly blow” at the Trotskyist alliance.





[2]
Lenin is quoting from the resolution of the Fourth Congress of the
Lettish Social-Democrats “with the unavoidable changes”, necessitated by
the tsarist censorship. Thus, instead of the words “Congress of the
Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region”, he uses the phrase
“representatives of all the Lettish Marxist workers”; instead of “the
R. S. D. L. P.” he uses the words “the Marxist body”; instead of “the
Fifth All-Russia Conference of 1908 and the Plenum of the C. C. of the
R. S. D. L. P. of 1910” he says “the all-Russia representative body of
the Marxists of December 1908 and January 1910”; instead of “C. C. of the
Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region” he uses the phrase “their leading
body”.





[3]
Lenin is referring to the decisions of the Fifth (London) Congress
of the R. S. D. L. P. of 1907, the Fifth All-Russia Conference of the

   

R.S.D.L.P. of 1908 and the Plenum of the C. C. of the R.S.D.L.P.  of 1910

Over eighteen months ago, in August 1912, there occurred an
event of fairly great importance in the history of the working-class
movement in Russia. On the eve of the elections to the Fourth Duma, the
liquidators “united” with, as they put it, the representatives of
different trends at the August Conference, thereby attempting to prove that
they were not liquidators at all, that they had not liquidated anything,
and had no intention of doing so, and that “unity” between them and the
really serious, non-fictitious workers’ Marxist organisations was quite
possible.  

The August Conference shifted the dispute between the liquidators and
their opponents to a different plane: it became, not only a question of
whether the liquidators’ theory and tactics were correct, but also of
whether the liquidators’ utterances were confirmed or refuted by their
own deeds. Was their August Conference a fiction,
make-believe, a fraud and a bubble, or was it a serious affair, a sincere
step, something real that showed the possibility of the
liquidators rectifying their errors?  

That is how the matter stood.  

The liquidators’ deeds, the results of their August Conference, had to
provide an answer to this question.  

This answer has now been given by the only Marxist body, namely, the
Lettish Marxists, recognised by all trends and groups without
exception as Marxists who have not violated Party decisions, and have
themselves gone through the famous August experience. We learn
from well informed sources that the meeting of the highest representatives
of the organised Lettish Marxists in Russia has drawn to a close. The
supremely authoritative character of this assembly of representatives of
the Lettish organised Marxists

    

has not been challenged by anyone, not by a single trend or by a single
group; on the contrary, it was attended by representatives and authorised
delegates, not only from the majority of the workers of Russia
(anti-liquidators), but also from the liquidators, from their
leading, August body, as well as from the Bund and the P.S.P. Left-wing.


The eighteen months’ experience of August blocs and institutions was
discussed from every angle and appraised by those who had themselves gone
through this experience in an endeavour to help the liquidators rid
themselves of liquidationism.  

What was the upshot of this discussion and appraisal?  

“The attempt on the part of the conciliators,” the
decision of the Lettish organised Marxists reads, “to unite at
all costs with the liquidators (the August Conference of
1912) proved fruitless, and the uniters themselves became ideologically
and politically dependent upon the liquidators”....  

This is the official decision of an unbiased body of Marxists, which
fully and conclusively exposes the August fiction!  

What we have been saying for two years, and what the
liquidators—while calling God to witness, and heaping abuse upon
us—have been denying, has now been proved and officially declared by
those who themselves participated in the August Conference, in the
August bloc, and in the leading August body.  

The Lettish organised Marxists have officially admitted that the
“focal point of the inner-Party struggle during the past five years has
been the question of the liquidationist trend” long ago condemned by the
entire Party, and that their, the Lettish, representative was being
recalled from the August leading body because that body (so runs the
decision of the Lettish Marxists) “has not dissociated itself from the
liquidators”.  

Thus, events have fully proved that we were right, and have once again
exposed the liquidators. We were right when we said that the August
Conference was a fiction, an imposture, a customary (in petty-bourgeois
parties and groups) pre-election fraud. The liquidators dared not
go to the elections with their banner and honestly stand by their

    

convictions; they hid behind the August bloc, calling God to witness that
they were not liquidating anything.  

The Letts have exposed this fraud.  

Mind you, these Letts were and remain neutral, so neutral that
they decided not to enter into any organisational relations with any
section of the Russian organised Marxists! The exposure of the August
fiction and of the liquidators’ election masquerade is the more significant
for its coming from neutral organisations.  

We shall have more than one occasion to revert to the decisions of the
Lettish Marxists, which prove once again how right we were when we said
that the unity of the Marxist workers in Russia was possible only in
opposition to the liquidators. In conclusion, we would mention only
one particularly important decision on the national principle in the
Marxist organisation.  

The Lettish Marxists themselves represent the workers of a
disfranchised and oppressed nation, and conduct their activities in centres
with very mixed populations. In Riga, for example, they have to deal with
German, Russian, Lettish, Jewish and Lithuanian proletarians. Long years of
experience have firmly convinced the Lettish Marxists of the correctness of
the principle of international unity in the local organisations of
the working class.  

“In every city,” the Lettish Marxists’ decision
reads, “there must be one united organisation of Marxist
proletarians, which must operate on the lines recognised by the Stockholm
Congress, and in conformity with the commentaries of the All-Russia
Conference of 1908.”  

These commentaries, as we know, definitely condemned the
principle of federation. Not the federation of national workers’
organisations, but international unity, a single organisation that conducts
activities in all the languages spoken by the proletariat in every
local area.  

That is the only correct principle of Marxism. That is the only
socialist form of resistance to the nationalist philistines, who are trying
to split the proletariat into national sections. That is a demand
for the decision of the entire Party to be carried out, a decision the Bund
has violated and is continuing to violate in a most flagrant manner.  
 

An end is coming to the deception sown among the workers by the
liquidators and Bundists, who are causing a split while trying to shout
loudest about “unity”. The decision of the Lettish Marxists, who are
neutral in our (Russian) conflict, has conclusively proved to all workers
that real unity can and must be built up only in opposition to
those splitters who defy the Party’s long-standing and constant demand for
the abandoning of liquidationism and of the principle that workers’
organisations should be divided according to nationality.

Less than a decade separates us from the turbulent period
of 1905, and yet the change that has taken place in Russia in this short
time seems tremendous. Russia seems all at once to have changed from a
patriarchal into a modern capitalist country. Leo Tolstoy, the ideologist
of the old Russia, expressed this in a characteristic and rueful tirade
when he complained that the Russian people “have learnt with astonishing
rapidity to make revolutions and
parliaments”.[7] 

Naturally, Russia’s “sadden” transformation into a bourgeois country
in a matter of five or ten years in the twentieth century was possible only
because the entire second half of the preceding century had been a stage in
the transition from the feudal to the bourgeois system.  

It is interesting to note how this change affected the attitude towards
Marxism of our official, university science of political economy. In the
good old days, only government professors of the extreme right engaged in
the business of “demolishing” Marx. Liberal-Narodnik professorial
scholarship as a whole treated Marx with respect, “recognised” the labour
theory of value, and thereby created the na\"ive illusion among “Left
Narodniks” that in Russia there was no soil for a bourgeoisie.  

Today, there has “suddenly” sprung up in this country a host of
liberal and progressive “Marxophobes”, among them men like

Mr. Tugan-Baranovsky,[1]

or Mr. Struve, etc. All of them have disclosed the true content
and significance of liberal-Narodnik “respect” for Marx. In word, their
respect has remained, but in deed, their long-standing inability to
understand materialist dialectics and the theory of the class struggle has
inevitably led them to renounce the theory of labour value.  
 

Until 1905 the bourgeoisie saw no other enemy titan the feudalists and
the “bureaucrats”; that is why they tried to be sympathetic towards the
theory espoused by the European proletariat, and tried not to see the
“enemy on the left”. After 1905, a counter-revolutionary liberal
bourgeoisie a in Russia, and professorial, liberal scholarship; without
the slightest loss of prestige in “society”, seriously proceeded to
demolish Marx.  

We propose to acquaint the reader with the latest scholarly work of one
of these “serious” scholars.  
I

Last year V. P. Ryabushinsky published Part I of Mr. Pyotr Struve’s
work The Economy and Prices (M. 1913). The celebrated “alliance
between science and industry”, which was first marked by
Mr. Ryabushinsky’s publication of Mr. Struve’s discourse on “Great
Russia”; has gained strength and attained full stature. From a simple
alliance between science and industry there has now emerged an alliance
between science, industry and the authorities, for Mr. Struve submitted his
research as a treatise for a scientific degree, which has been conferred on
him.  

In his preface Mr. Struve assures us that he planned this work about
fifteen years ago. Consequently, we have every reason to expect a piece of
serious and solid research.  

The author himself holds a very high opinion of his work, in which he
promises to “revise” (“critically”, of course) “certain traditional
problems and principles of political economy”. The revision also involves
the significance of price “as the fundamental concept of political
economy”.  


   “This revision will lead to the posing of new
   methodological problems for our science in the spirit of consistent
   empiricism, based on strictly evolved, precise concepts and clear
   distinctions.”  


This sentence, taken from the concluding lines of Mr. Struve’s
“work”, contains the leit-motif, as it were, of his
treatise. The author’s programme is “consistent empiricism” (this is how
any fashionable philosopher starts in our day, no matter what sanctimonious
humbug his theory may lead up to) and the “strict evolution of precise
concepts and clear

    

distinctions”, the familiar motive of the celebrated “criticism”, which
so often amounts to nothing more than verbal scholasticism....  

Mr. Struve wants to see “consistent empiricism” particularly in that
part of his book, by far the larger, in which he gives “sketches and
materials on the historical phenomenology of price” (this takes up nearly
the whole of Section 2 of Part I). And by “strict evolution of precise
concepts and clear distinctions” he means his disquisition, in Section 1
and in the Introduction, on “some fundamental philosophical motives in the
development of economic thinking”, on “the economy and society”, etc.


We shall first deal with these fundamental theoretical reflections of
Mr. Struve’s.  
II

“The normative, ethical conception of worth (tsennost) [value
(stoimost); Mr. Struve persistently uses the wrong term “worth”
instead of “value”, although the incorrectness of this was proved to him
long ago] that still prevails also among the canonists, is not so far
removed as it may seem from the conception of worth as the intrinsic
‘basis’ or ‘law’ of price. Indeed, we see that the ‘bonitas
intrinseca’ ‘valor’, and ‘pretium
       natura&lwhatthee’[2]

of the canonists is transformed into the ‘intrinsic value’, or
‘natural value’, or ‘natural price’, i. e., the objective
=

worth[3]

of the later economists” (XXV).  

Here we see Mr. Struve’s main idea (or rather his main ideophobia) and
the typical methods of this author. To discredit the scientific law of
value, Mr. Struve tries hard to identify it with the “ethical” law of the
canonists. Mr. Struve, of course, cannot produce a shred of evidence to
support this. Considering that he writes “we see” in a footnote referring
to a passage (and an irrelevant one at that) in the work of a

    

Russian Kantian of 1810, one can imagine what difficulty our scholar had in
his search for proofs!  

Mr. Struve cannot but know that in the Middle Ages all scientific laws,
not only the law of value, were understood in a religious and ethical
sense. Even the laws of natural science were interpreted by the canonists
in the same way. Therefore, the identification of the canonists’ law of
price with that of the representatives of classical political economy
simply cannot be taken seriously. This “idea” of Mr. Struve’s could
hardly be called an idea; it is simply ideophobia covered up with a purely
childish trick.  

Mr. Struve continues: 

“The ‘law of worth’ becomes the ‘idée fixe’ of
political economy, And in this sphere the ‘universalist’ (‘realistic’)
thought motive stands out most clearly in the works of an author who blends
it with the greatest sweep of general-philosophical conception of economic
science, namely, Marx. in his works this motive is combined with a
materialist world outlook that is all the more valuable for not being
elaborated in detail. He turned labour value, not only into a law, but also
into the ‘substance’ of price. We have shown more than once in our works
the way in which this mechanically naturalist and at the same time
‘realistic’ conception of worth vainly tries to embrace the world of
empirical phenomena of economic life and culminates in a colossal and
hopeless contradiction.”  

This is a striking illustration of Mr. Struve’s “scientific” method!
This is his method of annihilating Marx! A couple of pseudo-scientific
terms, a hint at thought motives, and a reference to a short magazine
article in
Zhizn[8] in 1900—that is all he can boast of. That is not
much, Professor!  

In his brief magazine articles Mr. Struve failed to prove that there
was any kind of contradiction, let alone a “colossal” one, between Vol. I
and Vol. III of Marx’s Capital, between the labour theory of value
and the formation of average price on the basis of the law of value.  

The medieval “distinction” between nominalism and realism and the
contraposition of universalism and singularism, which Mr. Struve juggles
with, add nothing whatever to our understanding of Marx’s theory, to
criticism of it, or to the clarification of Mr. Struve’s own theory (or
what he

    

claims to be his own theory). It is juggling, scientific junk, but not
science. Of course, in the controversy between medieval nominalists and
realists there is some analogy with the controversy between materialists
and idealists, but analogies and historical continuity can be established
between very many other theories, not only into the Middle Ages, but also
into ancient times. To study seriously the links between the controversies
of at least the Middle Ages and the history of materialism, special
research would be required. Our author’s book, however, contains no trace
whatever of a serious study of the subject. He flits from subject to
subject, hints at a thousand questions without examining a single one, and
with a boldness that is amusing enunciates the most emphatic conclusions.


He himself is compelled to admit in the passage we have quoted that
Marx blended his philosophy and political economy into an integral
materialist world outlook, and that Marx’s general philosophical conception
is the broadest!  

This is no trifling admission. A person who is compelled to make such
an admission and who talks about a critical revision of political-economy
and about its new methodological tasks, is in duty bound seriously to
examine all the components of Marx’s “integral” materialist
world outlook. But Mr. Struve does not even attempt to do that. He confines
himself to a few slighting remarks against “metaphysical
materialism”. Who does not know that, from the point of view of the
fashionable theories of agnosticism (Kantianism, positivism, Machism, and
so forth), both consistent materialism and consistent philosophical
idealism are “metaphysics”? In making remarks of this kind, Mr. Struve
merely hints at his own philosophical world outlook, which has
nothing integral about it. But the task of examining and studying Marx’s
integral materialist world outlook cannot be dismissed with
remarks of this kind. To attempt to do so is merely to issue oneself with a
testimonium paupertatis.  
III

On the other hand, the attempt to identify Marxism with the scholastic
doctrine of original sin is such a gem in Mr. Struve’s scientific treatise
that we cannot refrain from

    

examining it in greater detail. We ask our readers’ forgiveness in advance
for quoting long passages, but one must be accurate here in order to pin
down more firmly the methods used by modern liberal-professorial science.


“It is quite clear to me,” writes Mr. Struve, “that many centuries
ago Marx’s theory of labour worth, in its logical structure, had its
extremely close analogy and prototype in the ‘realistically’ grounded
scholastic doctrine of original sin.... Just as according to Marx empirical
‘prices’ are governed by the law of worth, and owe their existence to the
substance of worth, so to speak, so, according to scholasticism, the
empirical actions of men are determined by original sin.  

“Here are some analogies.  

“Marx: ‘The matter will be most readily pictured by regarding
this whole mass of commodities, produced by one branch of industry, as one
commodity, and the sum of the prices of the many identical commodities as
one price. Then, whatever has been said of a single commodity applies
literally to the mass of commodities of an entire branch of production
available in the market. The requirement that the individual value of a
commodity should correspond to its social value is now realised, or further
determined, in that the mass contains social labour necessary for its
production, and that the value of this mass is equal to its market
value.’[9] 

“Thomas Aquinas: ‘We must say that all men who are born of
Adam may be regarded as one man, since they are identical in the nature
which they inherited from their progenitor, just as, for example, all men
who live in one county are regarded as one body, and the whole county as
one man’....”  

Quite enough, is it not? Mr. Struve assures us that this is “not
playing at striking [!?] analogies or witticising”. Perhaps. But it is
undoubtedly playing at vulgar analogies, or rather, simply clowning. If
people who regard themselves as liberal and progressive scholars are
capable of tolerating such heroes of buffoonery in their midst; if these
heroes are granted scientific degrees,and are allowed to instruct the
young, then that only shows for the hundredth and thousandth time what the
“law” of the bourgeois era is: the more

    

insolently and shamelessly you make mock of science in the effort to
demolish Marx; the greater is your merit.  

Mr. Struve had to resort to clownish antics in order to cover up his
sheer inability to refute Marx. That the whole mass of commodities of a
given branch of industry is exchanged for the sum of commodities of another
branch, is an indisputable fact. That all “empiricists” determine average
price by taking the whole mass of commodities and dividing the aggregate
price by the number of individual commodities, is also a fact; Statistics,
for which Mr. Struve has such a liking (and which, as we shall see below,
he only “hints at” instead of trying to study), prove to us at every turn
that Marx’s method is constantly employed. But what do professional
“socialistophobes” care? The thing is to take a kick at Marx; all the
rest will take care of itself.  

The nature of the philosophical authorities who give Mr. Struve their
benediction in his noble occupation can be seen, among other things, from
the following words uttered by our professor: 


   “In this work [that of summing-up the ideas of the
   nineteenth century] impartial posterity should assign a prominent place to
   the great French metaphysician Renouvier, to whom many of the critical and
   positive ideas of our times can be traced” (43).  


Renouvier was the head of the French school of “neo-critical
idealism”, “an obscurantist of the first water”, as he was called by the
empirio-critic (i. e., anti-materialist philosopher) Willy (see my remarks
on Renouvier in Materialism and Empirio-Criticism. Critical
Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy. Moscow, 1909,
       p. 247).[4]

Renouvier wrote the word “law” with a capital L and simply converted it
into a basis for religion.  

See by what methods Mr. Struve demolishes Marx’s “integral [as he
himself admits] materialist world out look”; he puts Marx on the same
footing as a medieval theologian on the sole grounds that Marx takes the
aggregate prices of commodities of a single branch of production, while the
medieval theologian, Thomas Aquinas, takes all men who descend from the
first man Adam, and uses this as a basis for his doctrine of original
sin. At the same time

    

Marx is demolished in the name of the “great” Renouvier who preached
philosophical idealism in the nineteenth century and used the concept of
“law” as a basis for religion!  

O Mr. Struve! O disciple of the “great” Renouvier! O teacher charged
with the enlightenment of Russian youth!  
IV


   “In the vast reconstruction,” writes Mr. Struve,
   “which the edifice of political economy, as based on the idea of natural
   law, underwent after the onslaught of historism, both mystical and
   materialist, that idea was an utter failure. Its basic inner contradiction
   manifested itself. The latter revealed itself perhaps most glaringly in
   that form of ‘natural’ political economy which became the theoretical
   foundation of bourgeois economic liberalism.... Indeed, if natural law
   reigns in economic life, there can be no facts in that life which are out
   of harmony with natural law, or contradict it. And yet liberal ‘natural’
   political economy constantly fought, in books and in life, against such
   facts.... After the bankruptcy of bourgeois liberal political economy it
   became almost indecent to speak of ‘natural law’. On the one band, it was
   obviously unscientific to single out from an integral and, in principle,
   uniform social economic process certain individual aspects, relations and
   phenomena, as ‘natural’, and p lace them in a special category of
   phenomena. On the other hand, the proclamation of ‘natural law’, which even
   in economic liberalism rested on an unconscious ethical motive, was
   ethically discredited because it was regarded as a method that justified or
   perpetuated certain, social relations and forms that were only of temporary
   significance, because it was regarded as a ‘bourgeois’ apologia” (56–57).
   


This is how the author disposes of the idea of natural law. And this
has been written by a man who is compelled to admit that “the materialist
Marx extended a hand to the materialist Petty across the whole of the
eighteenth century” (56), and that “Petty is the most striking and most
out standing exponent of the powerful current which at the time flowed from
natural to social science” (50).  

It is common knowledge that a powerful current flowed from natural to
social science not only in Petty’s time, but in Marx’s time as well. And
this current remains just as powerful, if not more so, in the twentieth
century too. How can one raise the question of this “current” and speak
of the materialism of Petty and Marx in a work that claims to be
scientific, and is meant to study “the philosophical

    

motives of economic thinking”, without saying anything whatever about the
philosophical premises and deductions of natural science?  

But that is precisely Mr. Struve’s manner: to raise, or rather, touch
upon, a thousand and one questions, to “hold forth” on everything, to
present everything as being weighed and considered, but to give nothing
except a hash of quotations and running comments.  

It is a downright falsehood to say that the idea of natural law is
bankrupt in political economy, and that it is “indecent to speak of
it”. On the contrary. It is the “current from natural to social science”
that has been reinforcing this idea and made it inevitable. It is
“materialist historism” that conclusively substantiated this idea, after
stripping it of its metaphysical (in the Marxist sense of this term, i. e.,
anti-dialectical) absurdities and defects. To say that the “natural law”
of the classics is “ethically discredited” as being a bourgeois apologia,
is sheer nonsense. It means distorting both. the classics and “materialist
historism” in the most flagrant manner. For the classics sought and
discovered a number of capitalism’s “natural laws”, but they failed to
understand its transitory character, failed to perceive the class struggle
within it. Both these faults were remedied by materialist historism and
“ethical derogation” has nothing to do with it.  

By employing exaggeratedly “strong” language (“indecent” to speak
about “natural law”), Mr. Struve is trying in vain to conceal his
dread of science, a dread of scientific analysis of the
modern economy, so characteristic of the bourgeoisie. Lordly scepticism is
characteristic of them, as it is of all declining classes, but the idea of
a natural law governing the functioning and development of society is not
declining, but is steadily gaining ground.  
V

We shall now examine the “strictly evolved, precise concepts and clear
distinctions” which Mr. Struve promised to provide for the “formulation
of new methodological problems” of political economy.  
 


   “We define economy,” we read on page 5, “as the
   subjective teleological entity of rational economic activity or economic
   management.”  


This sounds “awfully learned”, but it is really a mere juggling with
words. Economy is defined as economic management! A statement of the
obvious.... The “subjective entity of economic management” may be found
in dreams and fantastic novels.  

Afraid to say the production of material products
(“meta-physical materialism”!), Mr. Struve gives us a gewgaw, not a
definition. By eliminating every element and symptom of social
relationships, Mr. Struve has “invented”, as if on purpose, an
“economy” that political economy has never studied, and can
never study.  

Here are the “three main types of economic systems” that he then goes
onto enumerate:
1) the sum total of parallel economic units;
2) the system of interacting economies, and
3) “community-economy” as the “subjective teleological entity”. The
first type covers, if you please, economies that are not interlinked and do
not interact (an attempt to revive Robinson Crusoe!); the second refers to
slavery, serfdom, capitalism, and simple commodity production; the third
refers to communism, “which was practised in the Jesuit state in Paraguay
to the extent that it is at all practicable”. This masterly
classification, in which no trace of historical reality is discernible, is
supplemented by the distinction drawn between economic and social systems.


Economic categories, Mr. Struve tells us edifyingly, “express
the economic relation in which every subject engaged in economy stands to
the surrounding world”; inter-economic categories “express
phenomena that spring from the interaction of the autonomous economies”;
social categories “spring from the social inequality among
interacting people engaged in economy”.  

Thus, the economic system of slavery, serfdom and capitalism may be
logically, economically and historically detached from social inequality!
This is what emerges from Mr. Struve’s clumsy efforts to introduce new
definitions and distinctions. “Arguing in the abstract, the sum total of
parallel economic units is compatible with relations of equality and
inequality. It may be a peasant democracy or a feudal society.”  
 

This is how our author reasons. From the point of view of
theory—logic, economics and history—his reasoning is utterly absurd. By
stretching the concept of the “sum total of parallel economic units” to
cover almost everything, he reveals how meaningless that concept
is. Peasant democracy, feudalism, and proprietors living side by side (on
one floor, on one landing, in a St. Petersburg apartment house), are all
the “sum total of parallel economic units”! The author has already
forgotten that, in his system, this sum total is sup posed to characterise
one of the three main types of economic systems. Mr. Struve’s
“scientific” definitions and distinctions are mere gibberish.  

This crude and trivial quibbling, however, this flouting of logic and
history has a “meaning” of its own. That “meaning” is bourgeois despair
and “don’t-care-a-damn attitude” (if one can thus translate the French
expression “je m’en fiche”). Despair of ever being able to give
a scientific analysis of the present, a denial of science, a tendency to
despise all generalisations, to hide from all the “laws” of historical
development, and make the trees screen the wood—such is the
class idea underlying the fashionable bourgeois scepticism, the dead and
deadening scholasticism, which we find in Mr. Struve’s book. “Social
inequality” should not be attributed to ,the economic system; it
is impossible to do that (because the bourgeoisie does not wish
it)—that is Mr. Struve’s “theory”; Let political economy indulge in
truisms, scholastics and the senseless pursuit of trivial facts (examples
of which will be found below), and let the question of “social
inequalities” recede into the safer sphere of sociological and legal
arguments. These unpleasant questions can more easily be “ducked” in that
sphere.  

Economic reality glaringly reveals the class division of society as the
basis of the economic system of both capitalism and feudalism. From the
moment political economy made its appearance, science has concentrated its
attention on explaining this class division. Classical political
economy took a number of steps along this road, and Marx took a step
further. Today’s bourgeoisie is so scared by this step, so disturbed by the
“laws” of modern economic evolution, which are all the obvious and too
formidable, that the bourgeois and their ideologists are prepared to throw
all

    

the classics and all the laws overboard, so long as they can relegate all
these social inequalities, or whatever you call them ... to the archives of
jurisprudence.  
VI

Mr. Struve would particularly like to relegate the concept
of value to the archives. “Worth,” he writes, “as something distinct
from price, independent of it and yet determining it, is a phantom”
(96). “The category of objective worth is merely, so to speak, the
metaphysical doubling of the category of price” (97).  

To demolish socialism, Mr. Struve has chosen the most ...  radical, the
easiest, and at the same time the most flimsy method, that of repudiating
science altogether. Here the lordly scepticism of the blasé
and frightened bourgeois reaches its nec plus ultra. Like the
advocate in Dostoyevsky’s novel who, in defending his client charged with
murder for the purpose of robbery, went to the length of saying that there
had been neither robbery nor murder, Mr. Struve “refutes” Marx’s theory
of value simply by asserting that value is a phantom.  


   “At present it is no longer necessary to refute it [the theory of
   objective value]; it need only be described in the way we have done here
   and in our ‘Introduction’ to show that it does not and cannot exist in
   scientific theory” (97).  


Now how can one help calling this most “radical” method most flimsy?
For thousands of years mankind has been aware of the operation of an
objective law in the phenomenon of exchange, has been trying to understand
it and express it with the utmost precision, has been testing its
explanations by millions and billions of day-by-day observations of
economic life; and suddenly, a fashionable representative of a fashionable
occupation—that of collecting quotations (I almost said collecting
postage stamps)—comes along and “does away with all this”: “worth is a
phantom”.  

Not for nothing has it been said that were the truths of mathematics to
affect the interests of men (or rather, the interests of classes in their
struggle), those truths would be heatedly challenged. No great brains are
needed to challenge the incontestible truths of
economic science. Just a word

    

inserted about value being a phantom, something independent of
price—and the trick is done!  

It does not matter that such an insertion is ridiculous. Price is a
manifestation of the law of value. Value is the law of price, i. e., the
generalised expression of the phenomenon of price. To speak of
“independence” here is a mockery of science, which in all fields of
knowledge reveals the operation of fundamental laws in a seeming chaos of
phenomena.  

Take, for example, the law of the variation of species and of the
formation of higher species from lower ones. It would be very cheap to
designate as a phantom the generalisations of natural science, the already
discovered laws (accepted by all despite the host of seeming contraventions
and deviations shown in the medley of individual cases), and the search for
corrections and supplements to them. In the field of natural science,
anyone who said that the laws governing phenomena in the natural world were
phantoms Would be put into a lunatic asylum, or simply laughed out of
court. In the field of economic science, however, a man who struts about
... stark naked ... is readily appointed professor, for he is really quite
fitted to stultify the minds of the pampered sons of the bourgeoisie.  


   “Price is a fact. We will put it this way: price is the
   concept of the real exchange relations between wealth in the process of
   exchange; it is a realised exchange relation.  

   “Worth is a norm. We will put it this way: worth is the
   concept of the ideal, or what ought to be the interrelation between wealth
   in the process of exchange” (88).  


How characteristic of Mr. Struve is this negligent, ostentatiously
off-hand remark: “We will put it this way”. Deliberately ponderous, and,
juggling with abstruse terms and new-fangled formulations, Mr. Struve
suddenly adopts the feuilleton tone .... Indeed, it would be
difficult to proclaim value a phantom without adopting a
feuilleton tone.  

If price is a “realised exchange relation”, then it may be asked:
relation between what? Obviously, between the economic units engaged in the
process of exchange. If this “exchange relation” does not arise
accidentally, as an isolated case and for a brief period, but repeats
itself with invariable regularity, everywhere, and every day, then it is
obvious that this “exchange relation” links the sum total

    

of economic units in a single economic system; obviously, there is
a firmly established division of labour between these economic units.  

Thus, all Mr. Struve’s wily reasoning about “inter-economic”
relations, which are alleged to be separable from social
relations, are already collapsing like a house of
cards. Mr. Struve has driven the concept of commodity production out of the
door only to let it steal in through the window. Mr. Struve’s famous
“empiricism” consists in expelling from science generalisations that are
unpleasant to the bourgeoisie, but which nevertheless have to be recognised
unofficially, so to speak.  

If price is an exchange relation, then one must inevitably understand
the difference between an individual exchange relation and a constant one,
between an accidental and mass relation, between a momentary relation and
one that embraces a long period of time. If that is the case—and it
certainly is—we must as inevitably work upward from the accidental and
the individual to the constant and wide spread: from price to
value. Mr. Struve’s attempts to proclaim value as something which “should
be”, to identify it with ethics, or with the doctrine of the canonists,
and so forth, collapse like a house of cards.  

By saying that the recognition of value as a phantom is “empiricism”
and that the striving (which can be traced “from Aristotle” to
Marx—p. 91—and it should be added:
through the whole of classical political economy!)—the striving to
discover the law of the formation of and change in prices is
“metaphysics”, Mr. Struve repeats the method of the latest philosophical
reactionaries, who by “metaphysics” mean the materialism of natural
science in general, and by “empiricism” mean taking a step towards
religion. Expelling laws from science means, in fact,
smuggling in the laws of religion. In vain does Mr. Struve imagine
that his “little stratagems” can deceive anybody with reference to this
simple and undoubted fact.  
VII

As we have seen, Mr. Struve has evaded a pitched battle
with the Marxists and taken shelter behind scepticism in general. But he
has made up for this by the zeal with which

    

he has scattered remarks against Marxism throughout his book, in the hope
of catching his readers after they have been stunned by the mass of random
and disjointed quotations flung at them.  

For example, he quotes a brief passage from Saint-Simon, mentions a
series of books on Saint-Simon (this copying from German bibliographies is
systematically practised by our “scholar”, evidently as the surest road
... to a scientific degree), and quotes lengthy passages from Renouvier
about Saint-Simon.  

What is the conclusion to be drawn from this?  

It is the following:
“Paradoxical as it may seem, it is simply an incontrovertible. historical
fact that the higher form of socialism, so-called scientific socialism, is
the offspring of the liaison between revolutionary and reactionary
thought” (51–52).
For the path to scientific socialism can be traced through Saint-Simon, and
“Saint-Simon was a disciple of both eighteenth century Enlightenment, and
of the reactionaries of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries” (53).
“This should always be borne in mind: historical materialism is
essentially the product of the reaction against the spirit of the
eighteenth century. First, it is the reaction of the organic view against
rationalism; secondly, it is the reaction of economism against
politicism. Moreover, in his religious period, Saint-Simon represented the
reaction of emotion and religion against the ideas of law and human
justice” (54–55).
To seal this, Mr. Struve repeats: “Marxism is the formula of the French
theocratical school, and of the historical counter-revolutionary reaction
in general, translated into the language of positivism, atheism and
radicalism. Dismissing reason, Marx remained a revolutionary and a
socialist” (55)....  

If Marx succeeded in assimilating arid further developing; on the one
hand, “the spirit of the eighteenth century” in its struggle against the
feudal and clerical powers of the Middle Ages, and on the other hand, the
economism, and historism (and also the dialectics) of the philosophers and
historians of the early nineteenth century, it only proves the depth and
power of Marxism, and only confirms the opinions of those who regard
Marxism as the last word in science. With a clarity that left no
room for misunderstanding

    

Marx always pointed out that the doctrines of the
reactionaries—historians and philosophers—contained profound ideas
about the operation of definite laws and the class struggle in the march of
political events.  

But Mr. Struve performs capers and declares that Marxism is the
offspring of reaction, although he immediately adds that Marxism can be
traced, not to Saint-Simon the clericalist, but to
Saint-Simon the historian and economist!  

It appears that, by means of a catch-phrase, and without saying a
single serious word about the contribution made by Saint-Simon to
social science after the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century
and before Marx, our author has leaped over the whole of
social science in general.  

Inasmuch as this science was built up, first, by the classical
economists, who discovered the law of value and the fundamental division of
society into classes; inasmuch as important contributions to this
science were made, in con junction with the classical economists, by the
Enlightenment of the eighteenth century in its struggle against feudalism
and clericalism; inasmuch as this science was promoted by the
historians and philosophers of the early nineteenth century who,
notwithstanding their reactionary views, still further explained the class
struggle, developed the dialectical method and applied it, or began to
apply it, in social life—Marxism, which made tremendous advances along
precisely this path, marks the highest development of Europe’s
entire historical, economic and philosophical science. Such is the logical
deduction. But Mr. Struve’s deduction says: Marxism is therefore
not worth refuting, the laws of value, and so forth, are not even worth
discussing, and Marxism is the offspring of reaction!  

Does Mr. Struve really think that he can deceive his readers and
disguise his obscurantism with such crude methods?  
VIII

Obviously, Mr. Struve’s scientific treatise would not have been a
scientific treatise submitted for a scientific degree if it did not set out
to “prove” that socialism is impracticable.  
 

Perhaps you think this is going too far? Is it possible, in a work
dealing with the question of price and economy as well as “certain
philosophical motives” of political economy, to “prove” that socialism
is impracticable Without even attempting to study the historical tendencies
of capitalism?  

Oh, for Mr. Struve there is nothing easier! Listen: 

“In the final analysis, economic liberalism envisages complete
identity—on the basis of the operation of ‘natural law’—between the
rational and what ought to be, and the natural and necessary in the
socio-economic process, its complete rationalisation.... Socialism, in its
most perfect form of historical, or what is called scientific socialism,
while rejecting ‘natural law’, at the same time accepts this fundamental
idea of economic liberalism. It also assumes that harmony is possible
between a rational structure and the natural course of things, and that the
complete rationalisation of the socio-economic process is possible”
(p. 58).
Then come a few off-hand phrases about this “belief” (p. 59)
and the following ponderous scientific deduction (p. 60).
(Paragraph 7, Chapter 2, Section I of Part I of Mr. Struve’s “work”):


“Comparing the socialist and liberal ideal with the world of reality,
scientifically empirical research must admit that the belief contained in
these ideals is groundless. In the formal sense, both these ideals are
equally impracticable, equally utopian.”  

When reading things like this, one can scarcely believe the evidence of
one’s eyes. What a degree of senile decay and prostitution has been reached
by present-day professorial science! Mr. Struve knows perfectly fell that
scientific socialism is based on the fact of capitalism’s socialisation of
production. This fact is borne out by a host of phenomena to be observed
all over the world. And there is a wealth of “empirical” evidence
pointing to the degree and rapidity with which these phenomena are
developing.  

But our scholar, who evades the question of the socialisation of
production and does not touch upon a single sphere of
these innumerable facts in his “scientifically empirical research”,
declares, on the basis of a few meaningless phrases about liberalism and
rationalisation, that the question is scientifically solved!  
 

It is not true to say that liberalism envisages complete
rationalisation. It is not true to say that Marxism repudiates
“natural law”. The entire phrase, “complete rationalisation”, is false
and meaningless; it is all a shoddy evasion, a stupid game in pursuit of a
single purpose: to evade an issue that has been clearly and precisely
formulated by scientific socialism; to stun young students with claptrap
about socialism being impracticable.  
IX

The bulk of Mr. Struve’s treatise, much more than a half, is devoted to
“sketches and materials on the historical phenomenology of price”.  

This is where our ardent advocate of “consistent empiricism”, who
declares value to be a phantom and has studied prices as facts,
can really show his mettle!  

Price statistics in the last few years have made great advances. An
enormous amount of material has been collected in all countries. Quite a
few books have been published on the history of prices. If our strict
scholar does not even condescend to refute Marx’s theory of value, why
could he not at least analyse some of the fundamental problems of this
theory with the aid of the “empirical” material furnished by the history
and statistics of prices?  Thousands of commodities and hundreds of
sections or periods of the history of their prices can be found, where the
influence of all extraneous factors can be eliminated—with the exception
of the labour “factor”—and where precise data is available on
the amount of labour consumed in the production of a given commodity. Why
could not our advocate of “consistent empiricism”, in a work of
“scientific research” on prices, even touch upon these data in
the section dealing with the “historical phenomenology of price”?  

Why? Obviously because Mr; Struve was only too well aware of the
hopelessness of his case, of the impossibility of refuting the theory of
objective, labour value, and instinctively felt that he must steer
clear of all scientific research.  

The hundreds of pages of Mr. Struve’s treatise devoted to “sketches
and materials on the historical phenomenology of price” are an
exceptionally remarkable illustration of

    

how present-day bourgeois scientists steer clear of science. What will you
not find in these pages! Comments on fixed and free prices; several
observations on the Polynesians; excerpts from the market regulations
issued by (ah, what erudition!) King Andrianampoinimerina, unifier of
Madagascar, in 178?–1810; several clauses of the Code of Hammurabi, King
of Babylon (about 2100 B. C.) concerning a surgeon’s fee for, performing an
operation; several passages, mostly in Latin and highly scholarly,
concerning the scheduling of the purchase price of women in ancient German
codes; the translation of seven passages referring to commercial law from
the works of the holy lawgivers of India, Mann and Yajna
       Valmiki[5]

;

the protection of purchasers in Roman law, and so on and so forth, right up
to Hellenic examples of the police regulation of prices in Rome and the
Christianisation of Roman police law in the legislation of the Carolings.


We may expect that Mr. V. P. Ryabushinsky, who published Mr. Struve’s
treatise, will immortalise his own fame as a patron and the fame of
Mr. Struve as a serious scholar, by publishing another hundred or so of
volumes of sketches and materials on the historical methodology of prices
describing, let us say,the bazaars of all times and all nations, with
illustrations in the text and with comments by Mr. Struve wrenched from the
best German bibliographies. Consistent empiricism will triumph, while the
phantoms of various “laws” of political economy will vanish like smoke.

X

In the old pre-revolutionary Russia, scholars and scientists were
divided into two big camps: those who made up to the government, and those
who were independent; by the former were meant hired hacks and those who
wrote to order.  

This crude division, which corresponded to patriarchal, semi-Asiatic
relations, is undoubtedly now obsolete and

    

should be relegated to the archives. Russia is rapidly be coming
Europeanised. Our bourgeoisie is almost quite mature, and in some ways
overripe. Its scholars and scientists are “independent” of the
government; they are incapable of writing to order; they earnestly and
conscientiously study problems from a point of view and by methods which
they sincerely and conscientiously believe to coincide with the interests
of “captains” of our commerce and industry like
Mr. V. P. Ryabushinsky. To earn the reputation of a serious scientist or
scholar and to obtain official recognition of one’s works in our times,
when such advances have been made in everything, one must prove with the
aid of a couple of “Kantian-style” definitions that socialism is
impracticable; one must demolish Marxism by explaining to one’s readers and
listeners that it is not worth refuting, and by quoting a thousand names
and titles of books by European professors; one must throw by the board all
scientific laws in general, to make room for religious laws; one must pile
up a mountain of highly scientific lumber and rubbish with which to stuff
the heads of young students.  

It does not matter if the result is far more crude than that coming
from the bourgeois scientists and scholars of Germany. The important thing
is that Russia, after all, has definitely taken the path of
Europeanisation.

Lockouts, i. e., the mass discharge of workers by common
agreement among employers, is as necessary and inevitable a phenomenon in
capitalist society as strikes are. Capital, which throws the whole of its
crushing weight upon the ruined small producers and the proletariat,
constantly threatens to force the conditions of the workers down to
starvation level and condemn them to death from starvation. And in all
countries there have been cases, even whole periods in the life of nations,
when the failure of the workers to fight back has led to their being
reduced to incredible poverty and all the horrors of starvation.  

The workers’ resistance springs from their very conditions of
life—the sale of labour-power. Only as a result of this resistance,
despite the tremendous sacrifices the workers have to make in the struggle,
are they able to maintain anything like a tolerable standard of living. But
capital is becoming more and more concentrated, manufacturers’ associations
are growing, the number of destitute and unemployed people is increasing,
and so also is want among the proletariat; consequently, it is becoming
harder than ever to fight for a decent standard of living. The cost of
living, which has been rising rapidly in recent years, often nullifies all
the workers’ efforts.  

By drawing larger and larger masses of the proletariat into the
organised struggle, the workers’ organisations, and first and foremost the
trade unions, make the workers’ resistance more planned and
systematic. With the existence of mass trade unions of different types,
strikes become more stubborn: they occur less often, but each conflict is
of bigger dimensions.  
 

Lockouts are caused by a sharpening of the struggle, and in their turn,
sharpen that struggle. Rallying in the struggle and developing its
class-consciousness, its organisation and experience in that struggle, the
proletariat becomes more and more firmly convinced that the complete
economic reconstruction of capitalist society is essential.  

Marxist tactics consist in combining the different forms of
struggle, in the skilful transition from one form to another, in steadily
enhancing the consciousness of the masses and extending the area of their
collective actions, each of which, taken separately, may be aggressive or
defensive, and all of which, taken together, lead to a more intense and
decisive conflict.  

Russia lacks the fundamental conditions for such a development
of the struggle as we see in the West-European countries, namely, a
struggle waged through the medium of firmly established and systematically
developing trade unions.  

Unlike Europe, which has enjoyed political freedom for a long time, the
strike movement in Russia in 1912–14 extended beyond the narrow trade
union limits. The liberals denied this, while the liberal-labour
politicians (liquidators) failed to understand it, or shut their eyes to
it. But the fact compelled them to admit it. In Milyukov’s Duma speech
during the interpellation on the Lena events, this forced,
belated, half-hearted, platonic (i.e., accompanied, not by effective
assistance, but only by sighs) admission of the general
significance of the working-class movement was quite definite. By their
liberal talk about the “strike craze” and their opposition to
combining economic and other motives in the strike movement (we would
remind our readers that Messrs. Yezhov and Co. began to talk in this
fashion in 1912!) the liquidators aroused the legitimate disgust of
the workers. That is why the workers firmly and deliberately had the
liquidators “removed from office” in the working-class movement.  

The Marxists’ attitude towards the strike movement caused no wavering
or dissatisfaction among the workers. Moreover, the significance of
lockouts was formally and officially appraised by the organised Marxists
as far back
    

as February
1913[2] (true, in an arena which the liquidators, those slaves of the
liberals, do not see). Already in February 1913 the formal decision of the
Marxists definitely and clearly spoke of lockouts and the necessity of
taking them into account in our tactics. How are they to be taken
into account? By going more carefully into the expediency of any given
action, by changing the form of struggle, substituting (it was precisely
substitution that was proposed!) one form for another, the general tendency
being to rise to higher forms. The class-conscious workers are
well acquainted with certain concrete cases when the movement rose to
higher forms which were historically subjected to repeated test, and which
are “unintelligible” and “alien” only to the liquidators.  

On March 21, immediately after the lockout was declared, the Pravdists
issued their clear-cut slogan: Do not let the employers choose for
us the time and form of action; do not go on strike now! The labour unions
and the organised Marxists knew and saw that this slogan was their
own, drawn up by that same majority of the advanced proletariat which
had secured the election of its representatives to the Insurance
Board,[3] and which is guiding all the activities of the
St. Petersburg workers in the face of the disruptive and liberal
outcries of the liquidators.  

The slogan of March 21—do not go on strike now—was the slogan of
the workers, who knew that they would be able to substitute one
form for another, that they were striving and would continue to
strive—through the constantly changing forms of the movement—for a
general rise to a higher level.  

The workers knew that the disrupters of the working-class
movement—the liquidators and the Narodniks—would try to disrupt the
workers’ cause in this case, too, and they were prepared in advance to
offer resistance.  

On March 26, both the liquidator and Narodnik groups of disrupters and
violators of the will of the majority of the class-conscious
workers of St. Petersburg and of Russia, published in their newspapers the
bourgeois banalities that are common to these camps. The Narodniks (to the
delight of the liquidators) chattered about “thoughtlessness” (the
class-conscious workers have long been aware that nobody

    

is so thoughtless as the Narodniks), while the liquidators delivered
liberal speeches (already analysed and condemned in Put Pravdy
No. 47) and urged that instead of strikes the workers should resort to
... no, not the corresponding higher forms, but to ... petitions and
“resolutions”!  

Brushing aside this shameful liberal advice of the liquidators, and
brushing aside the thoughtless chatter of the Narodniks, the advanced
workers firmly proceeded along their own road.  

The old decision, which called, in certain cases of lockouts,
for strikes to be superseded by certain higher forms of struggle
corresponding to them, was well known to the workers and correctly applied
by them.  

The employers failed to achieve the provocative purpose of their
lockout. The workers did not accept battle on the ground chosen by their
enemies; in due time, the workers applied the decision of the organised
Marxists and, with greater energy and more demonstratively, conscious of
the importance of their movement, continue to march along the old road.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The article “Forms of the Working-Class Movement (The Lockout and
Marxist Tactics)” was written in connection with the lockout declared
by St. Petersburg factory owners on March 20 (April 2), 1914.  

In March 1914 mass cases of poisoning occurred among the women employed
at the Treugolnik Mills in St. Petersburg, evoking general indignation and
strikes of protest on the part of the workers in the capital. The
St. Petersburg factory owners retorted by a lockout, as many as 70,000
workers being thrown out in a single day. The aim was to provoke the
workers to a mass strike, the better to be able to make short work of the
labour movement. But, led by the Bolsheviks, the workers refused to be
provoked. In view of the lockout, the declaration of a mass strike was
considered inadvisable, and Pravda called the workers to other
forms of struggle, such as mass meetings at the factories and revolutionary
demonstrations in the streets. The St. Petersburg Committee of the
R. S. D. L. P. issued a leaflet calling upon the workers to take part in a
demonstration to be held on April 4, 1914, the second anniversary of the
Lena shootings.  

On the appointed day the newspaper Put Pravdy came out with an
editorial by Lenin—“Forms of the Working-Class Movement”. This article,
in a form adapted to the conditions of the

   

existing censorship, urged the workers to carry out the decisions of the
Cracow meeting of the C. C. of the R. S. D. L. P. held jointly with Party
workers, which mentioned the need to discover “new forms of struggle
against lockouts” and to replace political strikes “by revolutionary
meetings and revolutionary street demonstrations”. Lenin laid special
emphasis on the importance of revolutionary demonstrations as a time-tested
form of struggle.  

The workers responded to the Party’s appeal with a powerful
revolutionary demonstration, which was reported by all the bourgeois
newspapers. Reporting the demonstration, the liquidationist Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta made no mention of the leaflets distributed by the
St. Petersburg Committee, and even attacked Lenin’s article “Forms of the
Working-Class Movement”. At a time when the workers were engaged in a
sharp struggle against the capitalists, the liquidators called upon the
workers to “calm down” and attacked the Bolsheviks for organising the
revolutionary demonstration. Lenin called the liquidators’ behaviour
monstrous and described their attitude to the Fourth of April demonstration

as =

a =

typical instance of wrecking illegal work. In the report of the C.C. of the
R. S. D. L. P. to the Brussels Conference, Lenin devoted a good deal of
space to exposing the activities of the liquidators. (See pp. 495–535 of
this volume.)





[2]
The reference is to the Conference of the C. C. of the
R. S. D. L. P. with Party workers, called, for reasons of secrecy, the
“February” meeting. It was held in Cracow on December 26, 1912-January 1,
1913 (January 8–14, 1913), and was attended by Lenin, N. K. Krupskaya, the
Bolshevik deputies to the Fourth Duma A. Y. Badayev, G. I. Petrovsky,
N. R. Shagov, and others. The illegal Party organisations of
St. Petersburg, the Moscow region, the South, the Urals and the Caucasus
were represented at the meeting. In the chair was Lenin, who made reports
on the subjects “The Revolutionary Upswing, Strikes and the Tasks of the
Party”, “The Attitude to the Liquidators and Unity” (the texts of these
reports are missing), drafted and edited all the resolutions, and wrote the
“Report” of the meeting by the C. C. of the R. S. D. L. P.  

The Conference adopted decisions on the most important issues of the
working-class movement, namely: the tasks of the Party in connection with
the new revolutionary upswing and the growing strike movement, the
building-up of the illegal organisation, the work of the Social-Democratic
group in the Duma, the insurance campaign, the Party press, the national
Social-Democratic organisations, the struggle against liquidationism, and
the unity of the proletarian party.  

The Conference’s decisions played an important part in strengthening
the Party and its unity, in extending and consolidating the Party’s
contacts with the masses, and evolving new forms of Party work adapted to
the rising wave of the working-class movement.

As soon as the Left-Narodnik gentry pass from empty and
general phrases about the “labouring peasantry”—phrases that have been
worked to death and reveal ignorance of both The Communist
Manifesto and of Capital—to precise figures, we
immediately see how the Left Narodniks white wash the bourgeoisie.  

The bourgeois character of the entire “labouring peasantry”
theory is disguised behind catch-phrases and exclamations, but it is
exposed by facts and by a study of Marx’s theory.  

Thus, in Stoikaya Mysl No. 14, a certain
Mr. Batrak,[1] who writes in an extremely highbrow style, discusses
“socialism and the peasantry”.  

“The number of labour economies is growing,” Mr. Batrak
declares, and goes on to quote French and German statistics. Statistics are
not the sort of thing that can be dismissed with catch-phrases or
exclamations, and deception is very quickly exposed.  

In France, the total area of “small farms”, i. e., those of five
to ten hectares (a hectare is slightly less than a dessiatine) has
increased.  

Very good, Mr. Batrak! But have you not heard that the more intensive
farming is, the more often one meets with the employment of
wage-labour on “small” (in area) farms? Does not this
hushing up of the facts about the employment of wage-labour mean
whitewashing the bourgeoisie, Mr. Batrak?  

Let us take the German figures. Out of 652,798 farms of five to ten
hectares, 487,704 employ hired labourers. What do you say to that?
Most small farmers exploit wage-workers! And in France? In France,
vinegrowing, which

    

entails the employment of wage-labour on small holdings, is far
more widespread than in Germany.  

The “labour economy” theory is one that deceives the workers by
hushing up the facts about the employment of wage-labour.  

Mr. Batrak takes Germany. The “small and medium” farms go as
“labour” economies (the tongue is so flexible it can call anybody a
“labouring” farmer!). And so, from the fact that the number of “small”
and “medium” farms is growing, Mr. Batrak infers that the number of
“labour” economies is growing.  

But consider the figures quoted by this new champion of the
bourgeoisie.  

He starts with farms of up to two hectares. They constituted
58.3 per cent in 1882, 58.22 per cent in 1895 and 58.89 per cent in
1907. An increase, is it not?  

But our “Left Narodnik” has hushed up the fact that this is an
increase in the number of wage-workers!  

The figures he distorts state definitely that of the 3,378, 509 farmers
who own farms of up to two hectares (1907), only 474,915, i. e., a
little over 116 (one-tenth), are independent farmers whose chief occupation
is agriculture. Most of them are wage-labourers (1,822,792).  

Of the 3,378,509 farms, 2,920,119, i. e., the vast majority, are
subsidiary undertakings where farming does not provide
the main earnings.  

One may ask: Is not passing off farm-hands and day-labourers,
wage-workers, as “labouring farmers” a white-washing of the bourgeoisie
and capitalism?  

Does not the silly catch-phrase of “labouring farmers” serve here to
conceal the gulf between the proletariat (the wage-workers) and
the bourgeoisie? Does not this catch-phrase serve as a means of putting
over bourgeois theories?  

To proceed. Farms from two to five hectares. These constituted 18.60
per cent in 1882, 18.29 per cent in 1895, and 17.57 per cent in 1907. This
is what Mr. Batrak writes.  

What is his deduction? On that point he is silent.  

The deduction is: a decrease, not growth. It is precisely in
this group of farms, and only in this group, that employers of
labour (people who buy the labour of private individuals)

    

and those who hire themselves out do not quite preponderate.  The
number of farmers who hire labour is 411,311 (counting the number of hired
labourers) while the number of those who hire themselves out is 104,251
(the latter is not the total number; here the statistics are
incomplete). Together, we get a total of 515,000, and the total number of
these peasant farms is 1,006,277, so that even here more than half either
hire themselves out or employ labourers!  

The nice little catch-phrase of “labour economy” serves to deceive
the workers by withholding the facts about the buying and
selling of labour-power.  

Mr. Batrak then takes farms of five to twenty hectares, and shows that
their number is increasing.  

But what about the employment of wage-labour? Not a word, not a sound
about that. The theoreticians of “labour economy” have been commissioned
by the bourgeoisie to conceal the figures about the employment of
wage-labour.  

We shall take these figures: 652,798 farms (1907) of five to ten
hectares employ 487,704 wage-labourers, i. e., more than half exploit
wage-labour.  

A total of 412,741 farms of ten to twenty hectares employ 711,867
wage-labourers, i. e., all, or nearly all, exploit wage-labour.


What should we call a man who poses as a “socialist” and yet
classifies exploiters of wage-labour as “labouring farmers”?


As the Marxists have more than once explained, the Left Narodniks are
petty bourgeois, who whitewash the bourgeoisie and obscure the fact that it
exploits wage-labour.  

We shall return to the bourgeois theories of the Left Narodniks, and
particularly to Mr. Batrak’s theories, on a future occasion. At present we
shall briefly sum up.  

The “labour economy” theory is a bourgeois deception of the workers,
based, among other things, on the concealment of the figures
concerning the buying and selling of labour-power.  

As a matter of fact, the vast majority of the “small and medium”
peasants to whom the Left Narodniks are fond of referring without
discrimination, either sell or buy labour-power, either hire themselves out
or hire labour. That is the crux of the matter, which the
bourgeois “labour economy” theory obscures.  
    

 The proletarian says to the small peasant:
you are a semi-proletarian, so follow the lead of the workers; it
is your only salvation.  

The bourgeois says to the small peasant: you are a small proprietor, a
“labouring farmer”. Labour economy “grows” under capitalism as
well. You should be with the proprietors, not with the proletariat.  

The small proprietor has two souls: one is a proletarian and the other
a “proprietory” soul.  

The Left Narodniks are, in effect, repeating the theories of
the bourgeoisie and corrupting the small peasants with
“proprietory” illusions. That is why the Marxists relentlessly combat
this bourgeois corruption of the small peasants (and backward workers) by
the Left Narodniks.

I wish to deal with our government’s policy on the national
question. This is one of the most important of the questions that come
within the jurisdiction of our Ministry of the Interior. Since the time the
Duma last discussed the estimates of this Ministry, our ruling classes have
been bringing the national question in Russia into the forefront and
rendering it more, and more acute.  

The Beilis case attracted the repeated attention of the whole civilised
world to Russia and exposed the disgraceful state of affairs in this
country. There is not a vestige of legality in Russia. The Administration
and the police are given a free hand in their wanton and shameless
persecution of the Jews, even to the extent of covering up and condoning
crimes. This precisely was the, upshot of the Beilis case, which revealed
the closest and most intimate
    connection....[1]


To show that I am not exaggerating when I speak of the pogrom
atmosphere Russia is breathing, I can quote the evidence of that most
“reliable”, most conservative writer, Prince Meshchersky, the
“minister-maker”. Here is the opinion of “a Russian from Kiev”,
published in Prince Meshchersky’s journal,
Grazhdanin.[5] 


   “The atmosphere in which we are living is
   suffocating;;wherever you go there is whispering, plotting; everywhere
   there is blood lust, everywhere the stench of the informer, everywhere
   hatred, everywhere mutterings, everywhere
   

    groans....”[2]



the political atmosphere which Russia is
breathing. To talk or think about law, legality, a constitution, and
similar liberal na\"iveties in such an atmosphere is simply ridiculous, or
rather, it would be ridiculous, were it not so ... serious!  
 

This atmosphere is felt day in day out by every person in the country
who is at all intelligent and observant. But not everyone has the courage
to admit the significance of this pogrom atmosphere. Why does such
an atmosphere reign in our country? Why is it able to reign? Only
because the country is actually in a state of scarcely concealed civil
war. Some find it very unpleasant to admit this truth; they would put
a cloak over it. Our liberals, both the
Progressists[6] and the Cadets, are particularly fond of stitching such
a cloak out of patches of almost quite “constitutional” theories. But I
permit myself to consider that there is nothing more harmful, nothing more
criminal than for representatives of the people to spread edifying
deception from the rostrum of the Duma.  

The government’s entire policy towards the Jews and other “subject
peoples”—pardon me for using this “government” expression—will at
once become clear, natural and inevitable if we face the truth and admit
the undoubted fact that the country is in a state of scarcely concealed
civil war. The government is not ruling, but is waging war.  

It chooses “genuinely Russian”, pogrom methods of warfare because it
has no others at its disposal. Everybody defends himself the best
he can. Purishkevich and his friends cannot defend themselves otherwise
than by pursuing a “pogrom” policy, for they have no other means. It is
no use sighing; it is absurd to try to make shift with talk about a
constitution, or law, or the system of administration; here it is simply a
matter of the class interests of Purishkevich and Co., a matter of
the difficult position this class is in.  

Either settle accounts with this class resolutely and not merely in
word, or else admit that the “pogrom” atmosphere is inevitable and
inescapable in the entire policy of Russia. Either resign yourselves to
this policy, or else support the popular, mass, and, in the first place,
the proletarian movement against it. These are the only alternatives. There
can be no middle course here.  

In Russia, even according to official, i. e., palpably exaggerated
statistics, which are faked to suit the “government’s plans”, the Great
Russians constitute no more than 43 per cent of the entire population of
the country. The

    

Great Russians in Russia constitute less than half the
population. Officially, according to Stolypin “himself”, even
the Little Russians, or Ukrainians, are classed as a “subject
people”. Consequently, the “subject peoples” in Russia constitute
57 per cent of the population, i. e., the majority of the population,
almost three-fifths, in all probability actually more than three-fifths. In
the Duma I represent Ekaterinoslav Gubernia, the overwhelming majority of
whose population are Ukrainians. The ban on the celebrations in honour of
Shevchenko[7] was such an excellent, splendid, exceptionally happy and
well-chosen measure as far as anti-government agitation is concerned, that
no better agitation could be conceived. I think that none of our best
Social-Democratic agitators against the government could ever have achieved
such sensational success in so short a time as was achieved by this measure
in rousing opposition to the government. After this measure was taken,
millions upon millions of ordinary people began to be converted into
public-minded citizens and were made to see the truth of the saying that
Russia is “a prison of nations”.  

Our parties of the right and our nationalists are now clamouring so
vehemently against the “Mazeppists” and our famous Bobrinsky is defending
the Ukrainians from the oppression of the Austrian Government with
such splendid, democratic zeal, that one would think he wanted to join the
Austrian Social-Democratic Party. But if by “Mazeppism” is meant
gravitation towards Austria and preference for the Austrian political
system, then perhaps Bobrinsky will not he one of the least prominent of
the “Mazeppists”, for he complains and rants about the oppression of the
Ukrainians in Austria! Just think how hard it must be for a Russian
Ukrainian, for instance for an inhabitant of Ekaterinoslav Gubernia which I
represent, to read or hear this! If Bobrinsky “himself”, if the
nationalist Bobrinsky, if Count Bobrinsky, if squire Bobrinsky, if factory
owner Bobrinsky, if Bobrinsky who has links with the highest nobility
(almost with the “spheres”) thinks that the status of the national
minorities is unjust and oppressive in Austria, where there is nothing like
the disgraceful Jewish Pale of Settlement, or the despicable practice of
deporting Jews at the whim of

    

despotic governors, or the prohibition of the native language in schools,
then what should be said about the Ukrainians in Russia? What should be
said about the other “subject peoples” in Russia?  

Do not Bobrinsky and the other nationalists, as well as the Rights,
realise that they are bringing home to the “subject peoples” in Russia,
that is, to three-fifths of the population of Russia, the fact that Russia
is a backward country even compared with Austria, which
is the most backward of European countries?  

The whole point is that the position of Russia, which is governed by
the Purishkeviches, or rather, groaning under the heel of the
Purishkeviches, is so peculiar that the utterances of the nationalist
Bobrinsky admirably explain and foment Social-Democratic agitation.  

Keep it up, noble factory owner and landlord Bobrinsky; you will
certainly help us to arouse, enlighten and stir up both the Austrian and
the Russian Ukrainians! In Ekaterinoslav I heard several Ukrainians say
that they wanted to send Count Bobrinsky an address of thanks for his
successful propaganda in favour of the Ukraine’s secession from Russia. I
was not surprised to hear this. I saw propaganda leaflets, on one side of
which was the Ukase banning the Shevchenko celebrations while on the other
side were excerpts from Bobrinsky’s eloquent speeches in favour of
the Ukrainians.... I advised sending these leaflets to Bobrinsky,
Purishkevich and other Ministers.  

But if Purishkevich and Bobrinsky are superlative agitators in favour
of transforming Russia into a democratic republic, our liberals, including
the Cadets, are trying to conceal from the people their agreement
with the Purishkeviches on certain fundamental questions of national
policy. I would not be fulfilling my duty if, in speaking on the estimates
of the Ministry of the Interior, which is pursuing a national policy
everybody is aware of, I did not mention this agreement of the
Constitutional-Democratic Party with the Ministry of the Interior’s
principles.  

Indeed, is it not clear that anybody who wishes to be—putting it
mildly—in “opposition” to the Ministry of the Interior must also know
the ideological allies of this Ministry in the Cadet camp.  
 

According to a Rech report, the Constitutional-Democratic
Party, or the “party of people’s freedom”, held its regular conference in
St. Petersburg on March 23 to 25 of this year.  

“National questions,” says Rech (No. 83), “were
discussed... in a most lively manner. The deputies from Kiev, who were
supported by N.V. Nekrasov and A. M. Kolyubakin, stated that the national
question was a maturing major factor which had to be met more firmly than
it had been up to now. But F. F. Kokoshkin said that both the programme and
previous political experience called for very careful handling of the
‘elastic formulas’ of political self-determination for ‘nationalities’.”


This is Rech’s version of the matter. And although this
version is deliberately worded to keep the greatest numbers of readers
in the dark, the gist of the matter is nevertheless clear to every
observant and thinking person. Kievskaya
Mysl,[8] which sympathises with the Cadets and voices their views,
reports Kokoshkin’s speech with the addition of the following comment:
“Because it may lead to the disintegration of the state.”  

This, undoubtedly, was the gist of Kokoshkin’s speech. Among the
Cadets, Kokoshkin’s point of view prevailed even over the extremely timid
democratism of the Nekrasovs and Kolyubakins. Kokoshkin’s point of view is
that of the Great-Russian liberal-bourgeois nationalist who
defends the privileges of the Great Russians (although they are a
minority in Russia), and defends them hand in hand with the
Ministry of the Interior. Kokoshkin “theoretically” defended the policy
of the Ministry of the Interior—that is the gist, the core, of the
matter.  

“More careful handling of political self-determination” of nations!
Care must be taken that it does not “lead to the disintegration of the
state”!—that is the substance of Kokoshkin’s national policy,
which fully coincides with the main line of policy pursued by the
Ministry of the Interior. But Kokoshkin and the other Cadet leaders are not
infants. They are perfectly familiar with the saying:
“The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.” The state
exists for the people, not the people for the state. Kokoshkin and the
other Cadet leaders are not

    

infants. They know perfectly well that in our country the state is (in
effect) the Purishkevich class. The integrity of the state is the integrity
of the Purishkevich class. If one looks at the essence of their
policy, stripped of its diplomatic trappings, one will realise what the
Kokoshkins are concerned about.  

For the sake of illustration I shall quote the following simple
example. In 1905, as you know, Norway seceded from Sweden in face of
vehement protests from the Swedish landlords, who threatened to go to war
against Norway. Fortunately, the feudalists in Sweden are not all-powerful
as they are in Russia, and there was no war.  Norway, with a minority of
the population, seceded from Sweden in a peaceful, democratic, and
civilised way, not in the way the feudalists and the militarist, party
wanted. What happened? Did the people lose by it? Did the interests of
civilisation or the interests of democracy, or the interests of the working
class, suffer as a result of this secession?  

Not in the least! Both Norway and Sweden are countries that are far
more civilised than Russia is—incidentally, precisely because
they succeeded in applying in a democratic manner the formula of the
“political self-determination” of nations. The breaking of
compulsory ties strengthened voluntary economic ties,
strengthened cultural intimacy, and mutual respect between these two
nations, which are so close to each other in language and other things. The
common interests, the closeness of the Swedish and Norwegian peoples
actually gained from the secession, for secession meant the
rupture of compulsory ties.  

I hope that this example has made it clear that Kokoshkin and the
Constitutional-Democratic Party take their stand entirely with the Ministry
of the Interior when they try to scare us with the prospect of the
“disintegration of the state” and urge us to be “careful in handling”
an absolutely clear formula, which is accepted without question by the
entire international democracy—the “political self-determination” of
nationalities. We Social-Democrats are opposed to all nationalism
and advocate democratic centralism. We are opposed to
particularism, and are convinced that, all other things being
equal, big states can solve the problems of economic progress and of
the struggle between the

    

proletariat and the bourgeoisie far more effectively than small states
can. But we value only voluntary ties, never compulsory ties. Wherever we
see compulsory ties between nations we, while by no means
insisting that every nation must secede, do absolutely and
emphatically insist on the right of every nation to political
self-determination, that is, to secession.  

To insist upon, to advocate, and to recognise this right is to
insist on the equality of nations, to refuse to recognise
compulsory ties, to oppose all state privileges for any nation
whatsoever, and to cultivate a spirit of complete class solidarity in the
workers of the different nations.  

The class solidarity of the workers of the different nations is
strengthened by the substitution of voluntary ties for compulsory,
feudalist and militarist ties.  

We value most of all the equality of nations in popular liberties and
for
    socialism....[3]


and insist on the privileges of the Great Russians. But we say: no
privileges for any one nation, complete equality of nations and
the unity, amalgamation of the workers of all nations.  

Eighteen years ago, in 1896, the International Congress of Labour and
Socialist Organisations in London adopted a resolution on the national
question, which indicated the only correct way to work for both real
“popular liberties” and socialism. The resolution reads: 

“This Congress declares that it stands for the full right of all
nations to self-determination, and expresses its sympathy for the workers
of every country now suffering under the yoke of military, national or
other absolutism. This Congress calls upon the workers of all these
countries to join the ranks of the class-conscious workers of the whole
world in order jointly to fight for the defeat of international capitalism
and for the achievement of the aims of international Social-Democracy.”


And we, too, call for unity in the ranks of the workers of all nations
in Russia, for only such unity can guarantee the equality of nations and
popular liberties, and safeguard the interests of socialism.  
 

The year 1905 united the workers of all nations in Russia. The
reactionaries are trying to foment national enmity. The liberal bourgeoisie
of all nations, first and foremost the Great-Russian bourgeoisie,
is fighting for the privileges of its own nation (for example, the
Polish
kolo[9] is opposed to equal rights for Jews in Poland), is fighting for
national segregation, for national exclusiveness, and is thereby
promoting the policy of our Ministry of the Interior.  

But true democracy, headed by the working class, holds aloft the banner
of complete equality of nations and of unity of the workers of all nations
in their class struggle. From this point of view we reject so-called
“cultural-national autonomy”, that is, the division of educational
affairs in a given state according to nationality, or the proposal that
education should be taken out of the hands of the state and transferred to
separately organised national associations. A democratic state must grant
autonomy to its various regions, especially to regions with mixed
populations. This form of autonomy in no way contradicts democratic
centralism; on the contrary, it is only through regional autonomy that
genuine democratic centralism is possible in a large state with a
mixed population. A democratic state is bound to grant complete
freedom for the native languages and annul all privileges for
any one language. A democratic state will not permit the oppression or the
overriding of any one nationality by another, either in any particular
region or in any branch of public affairs.  

But to take education out of the hands of the state and to divide it
according to nationality among separately organised national associations
is harmful from the point of view of democracy, and still more harmful from
the point of view of the proletariat. This would merely serve to perpetuate
the segregation of nations, whereas we must strive to unite them. It would
lead to the growth of chauvinism, whereas we must strive to unite the
workers of all nations as closely as possible, strive to unite them for a
joint struggle against all chauvinism, against all
national exclusiveness, against all nationalism. The workers of
all nations have but one educational policy: freedom for the native
language, and democratic and secular education.  
 

I conclude by expressing my gratitude once again to Purishkevich,
Markov II and Bobrinsky for their effective agitation against the entire
political system in Russia, for the object-lessons they have
given, which prove that Russia’s transformation into a democratic republic
is inevitable.

Progressist were “a cross between Octobrists and Cadets” and
described the programme of the Progressist Party as being a
national-liberal programme.  

During World War I the Progressists became more active and demanded a
change of military leadership, the gearing of industry to the needs of the
front, and a “responsible Ministry” with the participation of
representatives of the Russian bourgeoisie. After the February

Dealing in Put Pravdy No. 34 with the interesting
events in Ireland, we spoke of the policy of the British Liberals, who
allowed themselves to be scared by the
    Conservatives.[1]


Since those lines were written, new events have occurred which have
transformed that particular conflict (between the Liberals and
Conservatives) over the question of Home Rule for Ireland into a general
constitutional crisis in Britain.  

As the Conservatives threatened a Protestant “rebellion” in Ulster
against Home Rule for Ireland, the Liberal Government set part of its
troops into motion in order to compel respect for the will of Parliament.


But what happened?  

Generals and other British Army officers mutinied!  

They declared that they would not fight against Protestant Ulster as
that would run counter to their “patriotism”, and that they would resign.


The Liberal Government were absolutely stunned by this revolt of the
landowners standing at the head of the army. The Liberals have been
accustomed to console themselves with constitutional illusions and phrases
about the rule of law, and clo se their eyes to
the real relation of forces, to the class struggle. And this real relation
of forces has been such that, owing to the cowardice of the bourgeoisie, a
number of pre-bourgeois, medieval institutions and privileges of the landed
gentry have been preserved in Britain.  

To suppress the revolt of the aristocratic officers, the Liberal
Government should have appealed to the people, to the masses, to the
proletariat, but that was something the

    

“enlightened” Liberal bourgeois gentlemen feared more than anything
else. The government actually made concessions to the mutinous
officers, persuaded them to withdraw their resignations, and gave them
written assurances that troops would not be used against Ulster.


Efforts were made to conceal from the people the disgraceful fact that
such written assurances had been given (March 21, new style), and the
Liberal leaders, Asquith, Morley and others, lied in the most incredible
and shameless manner in their official statements. However, the truth came
out. The fact that written promises had been given to the officers was not
denied. Apparently, “pressure” was brought to bear by the King. The
resignation of Secretary for War Seely, the assumption of his portfolio by
Asquith “himself”, the re-election of Asquith, the circular to the troops
about respect for law—all this was nothing but sheer official
hypocrisy. The fact remains that the Liberals yielded to the landowners,
who had flouted the constitution.  

Stormy scenes ensued in Parliament. The Conservatives heaped
well-deserved ridicule and scorn upon the Liberal Government, while the
Labour M. P., Ramsay MacDonald, one of the most moderate of the
liberal-labour politicians, protested in the strongest terms against the
reactionaries’ conduct. He said that these people were always ready to
fulminate against strikers, but when it came to Ulster they refused to do
their duty because the Irish Home Rule Bill affected their class prejudices
and interests. (The landowners in Ireland are English, and Home Rule for
Ireland, which would mean Home Rule for the Irish bourgeoisie and peasants,
threatens to somewhat curtail the voracious appetites of the noble lords.)
These people, Ramsay MacDonald continued, thought only of fighting the
workers, but when it came to compelling the rich and the property-owners to
respect the law, they refused to do their duty.  

This revolt of the landowners against the British Parliament, the
“all-powerful” Parliament (as the Liberal dullards, especially the
Liberal pundits, have thought and said millions of times), is of tremendous
significance. March 21 (March 8, old style), 1914, will be an epoch-making
turning-point, the day when the noble landowners of Britain

    

tore the British constitution and British law to shreds and gave an
excellent lesson of the class struggle.  

This lesson stemmed from the impossibility of blunting the sharp
antagonisms between the proletariat and bourgeoisie of Britain by means of
the half-hearted, hypocritical, sham-reformist policy of the Liberals. This
lesson will not be lost upon the British labour movement; the working class
will now quickly proceed to shake off its philistine faith in the scrap of
paper called the British law and constitution, which the British
aristocrats have torn up before the eyes of the whole people.  

These aristocrats behaved like revolutionaries of the right
and thereby shattered all conventions, tore aside the veil that prevented
the people from seeing the unpleasant but undoubtedly real class
struggle. All saw what the bourgeoisie and the Liberals have been
hypocritically concealing (they are hypocrites everywhere, but nowhere,
perhaps, such consummate hypocrites as in Britain). All saw that the
conspiracy to break the will of Parliament had been prepared long ago. Real
class rule lay and still lies outside of Parliament. The
above-mentioned medieval institutions, which for long had been inoperative
(or rather seemed to be inoperative), quickly came into operation and
proved to be stronger than Parliament. And Britain’s
petty-bourgeois Liberals, with their speeches about reforms and the might
of Parliament designed to lull the workers, proved in fact to be straw men,
dummies, put up to bamboozle the people. They were quickly “shut
up” by the aristocracy, the men in power.  

How many books have been written, especially by German and Russian
liberals, in praise of law and social peace in Britain! Everybody knows
that the historical mission of the German and Russian liberals is to show
servile admiration for what the class struggle has produced in Britain and
in France, and to proclaim the results of that struggle as the “truths of
science”, a science that stands “above classes”. In reality,
however, “law and social peace” in Britain were merely a brief result of
the torpor the British proletariat was in approximately between the 1850’s
and 1900’s.  

Britain’s monopoly has come to an end. World competition has
sharpened. The cost of living has gone up. Associations

    

of big capitalists have crushed the small and medium businessmen and come
down with their full weight upon the workers. Once more the British
proletariat has awakened after the close of the eighteenth century, after
the Chartist movement of the 1830’s and 1840’s.  

The constitutional crisis of 1914 will mark another important stage in
the history of this awakening.

Three issues of the journal Borba, which declares
itself to to “non-factional”, have already appeared in
St. Petersburg. The journal’s main line is to advocate unity.  

Unity with whom? With the liquidators.  

The latest issue of Borba contains two articles in defence
of unity with the liquidators.  

The first article is by the well-known liquidator Y. Larin, the same
Larin who recently wrote in one of the liquidationist journals: 


   “The path of capitalist development will be cleared of
   absolutist survivals without any revolution.... The immediate task is
   ... to imbue wide circles with the leading idea that in the coming period
   the working class must organise, not ‘for revolution’, not ‘in anticipation
   of revolution’....”  


Writing in Borba, this same liquidator now urges unity and
proposes that it should take the form of federation.  

Federation implies agreement between organisations enjoying equal
rights. Thus, in the matter of determining the tactics of the working
class, Larin proposes placing the will of the overwhelming majority of the
workers, who stand for the “uncurtailed slogans”, on an equal
footing with the will of negligible groups of liquidators, whose views
coincide more or less with the passage just quoted above. According to the
subtle plan of the liquidator Larin, the majority of the workers are to be
deprived of the right to take any step until they obtain the consent of the
liquidators of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta.  

The workers have rejected the liquidators, but now, according to the
plan of the liquidator Larin, the latter are to regain a leading position
by means of federation. Thus, the federation proposed by Larin is simply a
new

    

attempt to impose on the workers the will of the liquidators whom the
working-class movement has rejected. The liquidators reason as follows: we
were not allowed to come in by the door, so we will steal in by the window,
and call “unity through federation” that which is actually a violation of
the will of the majority of the workers.  

The editors of Borba disagree with Larin. Federation, i.e.,
gradual agreement between the liquidators and the Marxists as equal
parties, does not satisfy them.  

It is not agreement with the liquidators they want, but a new
amalgamation with them “on the basis of common decisions on tactics”,
which means that the overwhelming majority of the workers, who have rallied
to the tactical line of Put Pravdy, must abandon their
own decisions for the sake of common tactics with the liquidators.


In the opinion of Borba’s editors, the tactics developed by
the class-conscious workers, which have stood the test of experience of the
entire movement during the past few years, must be set aside. Why? So as to
make room for the tactical plans of the liquidators, for views that have
been condemned both by the workers and by the whole course of events.  

Utter defiance of the will, the decisions and the views of the
class-conscious workers is at the bottom of the idea of unity with the
liquidators which the editors of Borba propose.  

The will of the workers has been clearly and definitely
expressed. Anyone who has not taken leave of his senses can say exactly
which tactics the overwhelming majority of the workers sympathise with. But
along comes the liquidator Larin and says: the will of the majority of the
workers is nothing to me. Let this majority get out of the way and agree
that the will of a group of liquidators is equal to the will of the
majority of the class-conscious workers.  

After the liquidator comes a conciliator from Borba, who says:
the workers have devised definite tactics for themselves and are striving
to apply them? That means nothing at all. Let them abandon these tested
tactics for the sake of common tactical decisions with the
liquidators.  

And the conciliators from Borba describe as unity
this violation of the clearly expressed will of the majority of the

    

workers, a violation designed to secure equality for the liquidators.  

This, however, is not unity, but a flouting of unity, a flouting of the
will of the workers.  

This is not what the Marxist workers mean by unity.  

There can be no unity, federal or other, with liberal-labour
politicians, with disruptors of the working-class movement, with those who
defy the will of the majority. There can and must be unity among all
consistent Marxists, among all those who stand for the entire Marxist body
and for the uncurtailed slogans, independently of the liquidators and apart
from them.  

Unity is a great thing and a great slogan. But what the workers’ cause
needs is the unity of Marxists, not unity between Marxists, and
opponents and distorters of Marxism.  

And we must ask everyone who talks about unity: unity with whom? With
the liquidators? If so, we have nothing to do with each other.  

But if it is a question of genuine Marxist unity, we shall say: Ever
since the Pravdist newspapers appeared we hive been calling for the unity
of all the forces of Marxism, for unity from below, for unity in practical
activities.  

No flirting with the liquidators, no diplomatic negotiations with
groups of wreckers of the corporate body; concentrate all efforts on
rallying the Marxist workers around the Marxist slogans, around the entire
Marxist body. The class-conscious workers will regard as a crime any
attempt to impose upon them the will of the liquidators; they will also
regard as a crime the fragmentation of the forces of the genuine Marxists.


For the basis of unity is class discipline, recognition of the will of
the majority, and concerted activities in the ranks of, and in step with,
that majority. We shall never tire of calling all the workers towards this
unity, this discipline, and these concerted activities.

We are informed that the International Bureau has received
the reply of the organised Marxists to the Bureau’s offer to intervene, in
the affairs of Russian
Social-Democracy.[1] We publish below the more important parts of this
reply.  
 *     *  * 

Following receipt of the “Supplement” to No. 11 of The Periodical
Bulletin of the International Bureau, the representative body of
Russia’s organised Marxists feels bound to express profound gratitude to
the International Bureau and its Executive Committee for their assistance
to the working-class movement and for their efforts to strength en and
consolidate it by ensuring its unity.  

The present situation among Russian Marxists is as follows.  

The general state of affairs in 1907–08 led to an extremely grave
ideological crisis among Marxists and the break up of their
organisations. Both in 1908 and in 1910, organised Marxists formally
recognised the existence of a special theory advocated by the
liquidators, who repudiated and sought to liquidate the old Party,
and were out to form a new and legal party. This trend was emphatically and
irrevocably condemned by a formal decision. However, the liquidators
refused to accept these decisions and continued their splitting and
disruptive activities against the “entire body”.  

In
January 1912,[2] the entire Marxist body was opposed to the
liquidators, who were declared to be outside its ranks.  
 

Since then, the overwhelming majority of class-conscious workers in
Russia have rallied in support of the decisions adopted in January 1912 and
of the guiding body that was elected at the time. This fact, of which all
workers in Russia are aware, can and must be corroborated by objective
facts, in view of the incredible number of unsupported and grossly untrue
statements circulated by the liquidators and by the scattered groups
abroad.  

1.
The electoral law of Russia places the workers in a separate worker
curia. Of the members of the Duma elected by this curia, the Bolsheviks
constituted 47 per cent in the Second Duma (1907), 50 per cent in the Third
Duma (1907–12), and 67 per cent in the Fourth Duma (1912–14).  

The elections to the Fourth Duma were held in September 1912, and the
majority that was gained (two–thirds) proved organised Marxism’s complete
victory over liquidationism.  

2.
In April 1912, the Marxist daily newspaper Pravda began to
appear. In opposition to it, the liquidators started, also in
St. Petersburg, a rival organ, Luch, which pursued splitting
tactics. In the course of two years, from January 1, 1912 to January 1,
1914, the liquidators’ newspaper, together with all their supporters in the
shape of the numerous groups abroad and the Bund, received the
backing—according to that newspaper’s own reports—of 750
workers’ groups, whereas during the same period Pravda, which
fights for the Marxist line, rallied around itself 2,801 workers’
groups.  

3.
Early in 1914, elections were held in St. Petersburg of representatives of
the workers’ sick insurance societies on the All-Russia Insurance Board and
the Metropolitan Insurance Board. To the first body the workers elected
five members and ten deputy-members; to the second, they elected two
members and four deputy-members. In both cases, the lists of candidates
put forward by Pravda sup porters were elected in their
entirety. In the last elections the ballot figures announced by the
chairman were:
Pravda supporters—37;
liquidators—7;
Narodniks—4;
abstentions—5.  

We shall confine ourselves to those very brief figures. They show that
real unity among Marxists in Russia is making

    

steady headway and that the unity of the majority of the class-conscious
workers on the basis of the decisions of January 1912 has already been
achieved.  

The document then goes on to describe the disruptive activities of the
various groups abroad and the liquidators, who are persistently trying to
thwart the will of the majority of Russian workers.  

Besides partyists and liquidators, there are now no less than
five separate Russian Social-Democratic groups operating
abroad, besides the national groups. For two whole years, 1912 and 1913,
there has not been a shadow of any objective evidence that these groups
abroad are in touch with the working-class movement in Russia. In
August 1912 the liquidators formed what is called the “August bloc”,
which included, among others, Trotsky, the “Bund”, and the Lettish
Social-Democrats. That this “bloc”—which really served as a screen for
the liquidators—was a fiction, was pointed out long ago. Now this
“bloc” has fallen completely apart. The Congress of the Lettish
Social-Democrats, which was held in February 1914, decided to withdraw its
representatives from the bloc because the latter had not dissociated itself
from the liquidators. Trotsky, too, in February 1914, founded his own
group’s journal, in which he backed his outcries for unity by
breaking away from the August bloc!  

The “Organising Committee”, which now represents the “August bloc”,
is a pure fiction, and it is obviously impossible to enter into any
relations with that fiction. Since the liquidators talk about “unity” and
“equality”, it should be said that it is the prime duty of advocates of
unity to refrain from throwing into disarray the ranks of the united
overwhelming majority of the workers, and emphatically to repudiate the
liquidators, who are out to destroy the entire Marxist body. Talk about
“unity” coming from the liquidators is no less a mockery of the actual
unity of the majority of the workers in Russia than similar talk about
unity by the “Allemane-Cambier party” in France, or by the “P.P.S.” in
Germany.  

The authors then go on urgently to request the Executive Committee of
the International Socialist Bureau to bend every effort to hasten the
“interchange of opinion among all

    

the Social-Democratic groups on controversial issues” (resolution of the
December 1913 session of the International Bureau), in order to expose to
an impartial body, to the Inter national, the utterly fictitious nature of
the “August bloc” and of the liquidators’ “Organising Committee”, and
also to expose all their disruptive activities against the united majority
of the Social-Democratic workers of Russia.

In Put Pravdy No. 48 (for March 28), the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma published the text of its Bill
on national equality, or, to quote its official title, “Bill for the
Abolition of All Disabilities of the Jews and of All Restrictions on the
Grounds of Origin or
    Nationality”.[1]


Amidst the alarms and turmoil of the struggle for existence, for a bare
livelihood, the Russian workers cannot and must not forget the yoke of
national oppression under which the tens and tens of millions of “subject
peoples” inhabiting Russia are groaning. The ruling nation—the Great
Russians—constitute about 45 per cent of the total population of the
Empire. Out of every 100 inhabitants, over 50 belong to “subject
peoples”.  

And the conditions of life of this vast population are even harsher
than those of the Russians.  

The policy of oppressing nationalities is one of dividing
nations. At the same time it is a policy of systematic corruption
of the people’s minds. The Black Hundreds’ plans are designed to foment
antagonism among the different nations, to poison the minds of the ignorant
and downtrodden masses. Pick up any Black-Hundred newspaper and you will
find that the persecution of non-Russians, the sowing of mutual distrust
between the Russian peasant, the Russian petty bourgeois and the Russian
artisan on the one hand, and the Jewish, Finnish, Polish, Georgian and
Ukrainian peasants, petty bourgeois and artisans on the other, is meat and
drink to the whole of this Black-Hundred gang.  

But the working class needs unity, not division. It bas no
more bitter enemy than the savage prejudices and superstitions which its
enemies sow among the ignorant masses.

    

The oppression of “subject peoples” is a double-edged weapon. It cuts
both ways—against the “subject peoples” and against the Russian people.


That is why the working class must protest most strongly against
national oppression in any shape and form.  

It must counter the agitation of the Black Hundreds, who try to divert
its attention to the baiting of non-Russians, by asserting its conviction
as to the need for complete equality, for the complete and final rejection
of all privileges for any one nation.  

The Black Hundreds carry on a particularly venomous hate-campaign
against the Jews. The Purishkeviches try to make the Jewish people the
scapegoat for all their own sins.  

And that is why the R.S.D.L. group in the Duma did right in putting
Jewish disabilities in the forefront of its Bill.  

The schools, the press, the parliamentary rostrum—every thing is
being used to sow ignorant, savage, and vicious hatred of the Jews.  

This dirty and despicable work is undertaken, not only by the scum of
the Black Hundreds, but also by reactionary professors, scholars,
journalists and members of the Duma. Millions and thousands of millions of
rubles are spent on poisoning the minds of the people.  

It is a point of honour for the Russian workers to have this
Bill against national oppression backed by tens of thousands of proletarian
signatures and declarations.... This will be the best means of
consolidating complete unity, amalgamating all the workers of
Russia, irrespective of nationality.

The recent decision of all organised Lettish workers,
condemning the liquidators and supporting the Marxist line, struck a
decisive blow at the “August bloc”, by showing that sooner or later all
proletarian elements will break with the liquidators. Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta is doing its utmost to explain away this unpleasant
fact. This rather difficult job has been tackled by L. M. and F. D.  

We shall not trouble to reply to the petty wrangling which the
liquidators have started The only aspect of the matter we consider
important is that which has organisational and political significance.


The liquidators say: True, the Lettish Marxists have withdrawn from the
“August bloc”, but they have not joined the “Leninists”.  

Quite right, gentlemen! The Lettish Marxists have indeed remained
neutral. In our very first articles concerning the Lettish
decisions, we said that the Letts had taken only the first step,
that, generally speaking, they had acted like
conciliators.[1]


But have the liquidators considered what follows from this?  

If the Letts are really conciliators, if they advocate unity at any
price, and if they are neutral in the organisational conflict, then the
political appraisal of liquidationism made by the conciliatory Lettish
Marxists is a still more telling blow at the liquidators.  

From the political Aspect, this appraisal is quite clear and
straightforward. The Lettish workers have emphatically endorsed the old
decision that liquidationism is a manifestation
    

of bourgeois influence on the proletariat. They have declared that
unity with the liquidators means becoming “ideologically and politically
dependent upon the liquidators”.  

Yes, Messrs. L.M. and F.D., the Letts have indeed remained neutral;
they have not yet abandoned “conciliatory” hopes; they have not yet drawn
all the practical conclusions from the stand they took; they have given too
lenient treatment to the groups which defend you. But it was precisely
these lenient and neutral people who told you that your liquidationist line
expressed only the influence of the bourgeoisie on the backward
sections of the workers.  

The ludicrous muddle the liquidators have got themselves info in
appraising the Lettish decisions can be seen from the articles published in
Zeit, a newspaper of the Jewish liquidators. Here Mr. Yonov tells
us in verbose articles that “the Lettish comrades do not stand for a
split; on the contrary, they strongly oppose such tactics”.  

The same writer goes on to say that “the general spirit of the
resolution [of the Letts] is beyond all doubt the Leninist spirit. It [the
resolution] is based on hostility towards liquidationism, on recognition of
the need to combat it” (Zeit No. 14).  

Agree among yourselves, liquidators, and say either one thing or the
other.  

The liquidators hope that the Letts will yet take a step
backward—to liquidationism. We hope that they will take a step
forward, to the position of the Russian Marxists. Time will show whose
hopes will be justified. We calmly leave that to the course of the Lettish
and of the entire Russian working-class movement. For the present, one
thing has been achieved: the Letts have dealt a mortal blow at the “August
bloc” and recognised that liquidationism is a bourgeois trend.  

A few words about the Letts’ decision concerning the split in the
Social-Democratic group in the Duma. The six liquidator deputies have not
given a straightforward answer to the question as to whether they accept
the terms of the Letts. With Mr. F. D.’s assistance, they are trying to
“pull the wool over our eyes”, as the saying goes. However, they will not
succeed.  
 

Look at Mr. F. D.’s “arguments”. Confronted with the 1908 decision
(which the Letts endorsed) against amalgamation with the Jagiello
party, he replies by stating that the Social-Democratic group in the Second
Duma accepted ... the Lithuanian Social-Democrats. The “slight”
difference here is merely that Russia’s Marxists resolved on more than one
occasion to amalgamate with the Lithuanians, but not to
amalgamate with the P.S.P., because that party is not
Marxist. The difference is that the Lithuanian deputies were returned to
the Duma with the full support of all the local Social-Democrats, whereas
Jagiello was elected in the teeth of opposition from the Polish
Social-Democrats, in the teeth of opposition from the majority of
the worker electors.  

The Letts made it a condition of unity that the all-Russia decisions of
1908 and 1910 condemning liquidationism as a bourgeois trend
should be recognised. Does the Chkheidze group accept this condition? What
has Mr. F. D., who defends this group, to say about this? Only that “lack
of space prevents us [i. e., him] from dealing” with these all Russia
decisions.  

Very well, we shall wait until Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta
finds more space in which to say, at last, what its attitude is towards the
1908 and 1910 decisions of the entire Marxist body, which recognised
liquidationism as a bourgeois trend.  

As for the workers, they will undoubtedly draw their own conclusions
from the liquidators’ shuffling, and realise that these people are dead to
the cause of Marxism.

Our liberals refuse to admit that serf economy is still
practised on a vast scale in the Russian countryside to this
day. Serfdom lives on, for when the semi-pauper peasant, held in bondage by
means of money loans or the renting of land, works for the landlord with
his wretched horse and implements, we have here the economic essence of
serf economy.  

Under capitalism the worker owns neither land nor implements of
production. Under serf economy the exploited labourer has both land and
implements of production, but these serve to enslave him, to tie
him to the “squire”.  

The journal Russkaya Mysl, which is noted for its preaching of
respect for landed property, accidentally blurted out the
truth in its March issue.  


   “Winter hiring,”[1] we read in that issue“—is this not absurd in our age, the age of
   electricity and aeroplanes? And yet this form of slavery and bondage
   continues to flourish to this day, like a leech on the body of the
   peasantry.  

   “Winter hiring is a curious and characteristic feature
   of ancient Russia. It has preserved in all its freshness the feudal term of
   ‘bonded peasants’.”  


This was written not by some “Left” organ, but by a journal of the
counter-revolutionary liberals!  

According to local statistics for the spring of 1913, the “bonded”
households sometimes—as, for example, in Chernigov Gubernia—constitute
as much as 56 per cent, i. e., nearly three-fifths, of the total
number of households. And during winter hire the peasant receives half
or one-third of the pay he gets during summer hire.  
 

Here we have purely serf bondage and hopeless poverty among the
peasants, side by side with “progress” in the development of the
otrubs, fodder grass cultivation, the employment of machines, and
so forth, over which some naive people wax so enthusiastic. As a matter of
fact, this progress, perpetuating as it does appalling poverty and bond age
among the masses of the peasants, only worsens their conditions, makes
crises more inevitable, and intensifies the contradiction between the
requirements of modern capitalism and barbarous, medieval and Asiatic
“winter hiring”.  

Métayage, tilling the soil in return for half the crop, or
mowing hay in return for every third haycock (the “one third” system) are
also direct survivals of serfdom. According to the latest statistics, the
area of land cultivated by peasants on the métayer system in the
various districts of Russia ranges from 21 to 68 per cent of the area of
the peasants’ own land. And the area of land on which hay is mown on the
métayer system is even larger, ranging from 50 to 185 per cent of
the area of the peasants’ own land!...  


   “In some cases,” we read in this moderate-liberal
   journal, “the méayer, in addition to paying for the land with half
   the crop, and for the hay with two-thirds of the crop, is obliged to
   work gratis on the owner’s farm for one or two weeks, in most
   cases with his own horse, or with one of his children.”  


How does this differ from serfdom? The peasant works for the landlord
without pay, and receives land from him on a métayage basis!  

Our liberals always regard the “peasant question” from the point of
view of the peasants’ “land hunger” or the need for “state arrangement”
of the peasants’ living conditions, or of allotting them land according to
this or that “norm” (this is a fault of the Narodniks, too). This point
of view is basically erroneous. It is all a matter of the class struggle on
the basis of the feudal relations of production, and nothing more. So long
as the present system of landlordism exists, the perpetuation of bondage,
serfdom and, as Russkaya Mysl expresses it, slavery, is
inevitable. No “reforms” or political changes will be of any use
here. The point at issue here is the ownership of the land by a class which

    

reduces all “progress” to snail’s pace, and turns the masses of the
peasantry into downtrodden paupers tied to the “squire”.  

The issue here is not that of a “subsistence” or a “producer’s”
norm (all this is Narodnik nonsense), not that of “land hunger”, or
“allotting land”, but of abolishing class, semi-feudal oppression, which
is hindering the development of a capitalist country. Only in this way can
the “proverbial” “pillars” of the class-conscious Russian workers begin
to be understood.

practised by The landlords and kulaks during the winter, when the peasants
were badly in need of money and would accept extortionate terms.

The history of the workers’ press in Russia is indissolubly
linked up with the history of the democratic and socialist movement. Hence,
only by knowing the chief stages of the movement for emancipation is it
possible to understand why the preparation and rise of the workers’ press
proceeded in a certain way, and in no other.  

The emancipation movement in Russia has passed through three main
stages, corresponding to the three main classes of Russian society, which
have left their impress on the movement:
(1) the period of the nobility, roughly from 1825 to 1861;
(2) the raznochintsi or bourgeois-democratic period, approximately
from 1861 to 1895; and
(3) the proletarian period, from 1895 to the present time.  

The most outstanding figures of the nobility period were the
Decembrists[3] and Herzen. At that time, under the serf-owning system,
there could he no question of differentiating a working class from
among the general mass of serfs, the disfranchised “lower orders”, “the
ruck”. In those days the illegal general democratic press, headed by
Herzen’s
Kolokol,[4] was the forerunner of the workers’
(proletarian-democratic or Social-Democratic) press.  

Just as the Decembrists roused Herzen, so Herzen and his
Kolokol helped to rouse the raznochintsi—the educated
representatives of the liberal and democratic bourgeoisie who belonged, not
to the nobility but to the civil servants, urban petty bourgeois, merchant
and peasant classes. It was V. G. Belinsky who, even before the abolition
of serfdom, was a forerunner of the raznochintsi who were to

    

completely oust the nobility from our emancipation movement. The famous
Letter to
Gogol,[5] which summed up Belinsky’s literary activities, was one of
the finest productions of the illegal democratic press, which has to this
day lost none of its great and vital significance.  

With the fall of the serf-owning system, the raznochintsi
emerged as the chief actor from among the masses in the movement for
emancipation in general, and in the democratic illegal press in
particular.
Narodism,[6] which corresponded to the raznochintsi point of
view, became the dominant trend. As a social trend, it never succeeded in
dissociating itself from liberalism on the right and from anarchism on the
left. But Chernyshevsky, who, after Herzen, developed the Narodnik views,
made a great stride forward as compared with Herzen. Chernyshevsky was a
far more consistent and militant democrat, his writings breathing the
spirit of the class struggle. He resolutely pursued the line of exposing
the treachery of liberalism, a line which to this day is hateful to the
Cadets and liquidators. He was a remarkably profound critic of capitalism
despite his utopian socialism.  

The sixties and seventies saw quite a number of illegal publications,
militant-democratic and utopian-socialist in content, which had started to
circulate among the “masses”. Very prominent among the personalities of
that epoch were the workers Pyotr Alexeyev, Stepan Khalturin, and
others. The proletarian-democratic current, however, was unable to free
itself from the main stream of Narodism; this became possible only after
Russian Marxism took ideological shape (the Emancipation of Labour group,
1883), and a steady workers’ movement, linked with Social-Democracy, began
(the St. Petersburg strikes of 1895–96).  

But before passing to this period, from which the appearance of the
workers’ press in Russia really dates, we shall quote figures which
strikingly illustrate the class differences between the movements
of the three periods referred to. These figures show the classification of
persons charged with state (political) crimes according to social estate or
calling

       (class).[1]

For every 100 such persons there were: 
    

    




 
Nobles
Urban petty bourgeois and peasants
Peasants
Workers
Intellectuals

In the nobility or feudal period (1827–46), the nobles, who were an
insignificant minority of the population, accounted for the vast majority
of the “politicals” (76%). In the Narodnik, raznochintsi period
(1884–90; unfortunately, figures for the sixties and seventies are not
available), the nobles dropped to second place, but still provided quite a
high percentage (30.6%). Intellectuals accounted for the overwhelming
majority (73.2%) of participants in the democratic movement.  

In the 1901–03 period, which happened to be the period of the first
political Marxist newspaper, the old Iskra, workers (46.1%)
predominated over intellectuals (36.7%) and the movement became
wholly democratised (10.7% nobles and 80.9% “non-privileged” people).


Running ahead, we see that in the period of the first mass movement
(1905–08) the only change was that the intellectuals (28.4% as
against 36.7%) were displaced by peasants (24.2% as against 9.0%).  

Social-Democracy in Russia was founded by the Emancipation of Labour
group, which was formed abroad in 1883. The writings of this group, which
were printed abroad and uncensored, were the first systematically to
expound and draw all the practical conclusions from the ideas of Marxism,
which, as the experience of the entire world has shown, alone ex press the
true essence of the working-class movement and its aims. For the twelve
years between 1883 and 1895, practically the only attempt to establish a
Social-Democratic workers’ press in Russia was the publication in
St. Petersburg in 1885 of the Social-Democratic newspaper Rabochy;
it was of course illegal, but only two issues appeared. Owing to the
absence of a mass working-class movement, there was no scope for the wide
development of a workers’ press.  

The inception of a mass working-class movement, with the participation
of Social-Democrats, dates from 1895–96,

    

the time of the famous St. Petersburg strikes. It was then that a workers’
press, in the real sense of the term, appeared in Russia. The chief
publications in those days were illegal leaflets, most of them hectographed
and devoted to “economic” (as well as non-economic) agitation, that is,
to the needs and demands of the workers in different factories and
industries. Obviously, this literature could not have existed without the
advanced workers’ most active participation in the task of compiling and
circulating it. Among St. Petersburg workers active at the time mention
should be made of Vasily Andreyevich Shelgunov, who later became blind and
was unable to carry on with his former vigour, and Ivan Vasilyevich
Babushkin, an ardent Iskrist (1900–03) and Bolshevik (1903–05), who was
shot for taking part in an uprising in Siberia late in 1905 or early in
1906.  

Leaflets were published by Social-Democratic groups, circles and
organisations, most of which, after the end of 1895, became known as
“Leagues of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class”. The
“Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party” was founded in 1898 at a
congress of representatives of local Social-Democratic
organisations.[7] 

After the leaflets, illegal working-class newspapers began to appear;
for example, in 1897 St. Petersburg Rabochy
Listok[8] appeared in St. Petersburg, followed by Rabochaya
Mysl, which was shortly afterwards transferred abroad. Since then,
almost right up to the revolution, local Social-Democratic newspapers came
out illegally; true, they were regularly suppressed, but reappeared again
and again all over Russia.  

All in all, the workers’ leaflets and Social-Democratic newspapers of
the time—i.e., twenty years ago—were the direct forerunners of the
present-day working-class press:
the same factory “exposures”, the same reports on the “economic”
struggle, the same treatment of the tasks of the working-class movement
from the standpoint of Marxist principles and consistent democracy, and
finally, the same two main trends—the Marxist and the
opportunist—in the working-class press.  

It is a remarkable fact, one that has not been duly appreciated to this
day, that as soon as the mass working-class movement arose in
Russia (1895–96), there at once

    

appeared the division into Marxist and opportunist trends—a division
which has changed in form and features, etc., but which has remained
essentially the same from 1894 to 1914. Apparently, this particular kind of
division and inner struggle among Social-Democrats has deep social and
class roots.  

The Rabochaya Mysl, mentioned above, represented the
opportunist trend of the day, known as Economism. This trend
became apparent in the disputes among the local leaders of the
working-class movement as early as 1894–95. And abroad, where the
awakening of the Russian workers led to an efflorescence of
Social-Democratic literature as early as 1896, the appearance and rallying
of the Economists ended in a split in the spring of 1900 (that is, prior to
the appearance of Iskra, the first issue of which came off the
press at the very end of 1900).  

The history of the working-class press during the twenty years
1894–1914 is the history of the two trends in Russian Marxism and Russian
(or rather all-Russia) Social-Democracy. To understand the history
of the working-class press in Russia, one must know, not only and not so
much the names of the various organs of the press—names which convey
nothing to the present-day reader and simply confuse him—as the
content, nature and ideological line of the different sections of
Social-Democracy.  

The chief organs of the Economists were Rabochaya Mysl
(1897–1900) and Rabocheye Dyelo (1898–1901). Rabocheye
Dyelo was edited by B. Krichevsky, who later went over to the
syndicalists, A. Martynov, a prominent Menshevik and now a liquidator, and
Akimov, now an “independent Social-Democrat” who in all essentials agrees
with the liquidators.  

At first only Plekhanov and the whole Emancipation of Labour group (the
journal
Rabotnik,[9] etc.) fought the Economists, and then
Iskra joined the fight (from 1900 to August 1903, up to the time
of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.). What, exactly, was the essence
of Economism?  

In word, the Economists were all for a mass type of working-class
movement and independent action by the workers, emphasising the paramount
significance of “economic” agitation and urging moderation or gradualness
in passing

    

over to political agitation. As the reader sees, these are exactly the same
catchwords that the liquidators flaunt today. In practice, however, the
Economists pursued a liberal-labour policy, the gist of which was tersely
ex pressed by S. N. Prokopovich, one of the Economist leaders at that time,
in the words: “economic struggle is for the workers, political struggle is
for the liberals”. The Economists, who made the most noise about the
workers’ independent activity and the mass movement, were in practice an
opportunist and petty-bourgeois intellectual wing of the working-class
movement.  

The overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers, who in
1901–03 accounted for 46 out of every 100 persons charged with state
crimes, as against 37 for the intelligentsia, sided with the old
Iskra, against the opportunists. Iskra’s three years of
activity (1901–03) saw the elaboration of the Social-Democratic Party’s
Programme, its main tactics, and the forms in which the workers’ economic
and political struggle could be combined on the basis of consistent
Marxism. During the pre-revolutionary years, the growth of the workers’
press around Iskra and under its ideological leadership assumed
enormous proportions. The number of illegal leaflets and unlicensed
printing-presses was exceedingly great, and increased rapidly all over
Russia.  

Iskra’s complete victory over Economism, the victory of
consistent proletarian tactics over opportunist-intellectualist tactics in
1903, still further stimulated the influx of “fellow-travellers” into the
ranks of Social-Democracy; and opportunism revived on the soil of
Iskrism, as part of it, in the form of “Menshevism”.  

Menshevism took shape at the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. (August 1903), originating from the minority of the
Iskrists (hence the name

      Menshevism[2]

)

and from all the opportunist opponents of Iskra. The Mensheviks
reverted to Economism in a slightly renovated form, of course; headed by
A. Martynov, all the Economists who had remained in the movement flocked to
the ranks of the Mensheviks.  
 

The new Iskra, which from November 1903 appeared under a new
editorial board, became the chief organ of Menshevism. “Between the old
Iskra and the new lies a gulf”, Trotsky, then an ardent
Menshevik, frankly declared. Vperyod and
Proletary[10] (1905) were the chief Bolshevik newspapers, which
upheld the tactics of consistent Marxism and remained faithful to the old
Iskra.  

From the point of view of real contact with the masses and as an
expression of the tactics of the proletarian masses, 1905–07, the years of
revolution, were a test of the two main trends in Social-Democracy and in
the working-class press—the Menshevik and Bolshevik trends. A legal
Social-Democratic press could not have appeared all at once in the autumn
of 1905 had the way not been paved by the activities of the advanced
workers, who were closely connected with the masses. The fact that the
legal Social-Democratic press of 1905, 1906 and 1907 was a press of
two trends, of two groups, can only be accounted for by the
different lines in the working-class movement at the time—the
petty-bourgeois and the proletarian.  

The workers’ legal press appeared in all three periods of the upswing
and of relative “freedom”, namely, in the autumn of 1905 (the Bolsheviks’
Novaya
Zhizn,[11] and the Mensheviks’
Nachalo[12]—we name only the chief of the many publications);
in the spring of 1906 (Volna,
Ekho,[13] etc., issued by the Bolsheviks, Narodnaya
Duma[14] and others, issued by the Mensheviks); and in the spring
of 1907.  

The essence of the Menshevik tactics of the time was recently expressed
by L. Martov in these words:
“The Mensheviks saw no other way by which the proletariat could take a
useful part in that crisis except by assisting the bourgeois liberal
democrats in their attempts to eject the reactionary section of the
propertied classes from political power—but, while rendering this
assistance, the proletariat was to maintain its complete political
independence.” (Among Books by Rubakin, Vol. II, p. 772.) In
practice, these tactics of “assisting” the liberals amounted to making
the workers dependent on them; in practice they were
liberal-labour tactics. The Bolsheviks’ tactics, on the contrary, ensured
the independence of the proletariat in the bourgeois crisis, by fighting to
bring that crisis to a head, by exposing

    

the treachery of liberalism, by enlightening and rallying the petty
bourgeoisie (especially in the countryside) to counteract that treachery.


It is a fact—and the Mensheviks themselves, including the present-day
liquidators, Koltsov, Levitsky, and others, have repeatedly admitted
it—that in those years (1905–07) the masses of the workers followed the
lead of the Bolsheviks. Bolshevism expressed the proletarian essence of the
movement, Menshevism was its opportunist, petty-bourgeois intellectual
wing.  

We cannot here give a more detailed characterisation of the content and
significance of the tactics of the two trends in the workers’ press. We can
do no more than accurately establish the main facts and define the main
lines of historical development.  

The working-class press in Russia has almost a century of history
behind it; first, the pre-history, i.e., the history, not of the
labour, not of the proletarian, but of the “general democratic”,
i.e., bourgeois-democratic movement for emancipation, followed by its own
twenty-year history of the proletarian movement, proletarian democracy or
Social-Democracy.  

Nowhere in the world has the proletarian movement come into being, nor
could it have come into being, “all at once”, in a pure class form,
ready-made, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter. Only through long
struggle and hard work on the part of the most advanced workers, of all
class-conscious workers, was it possible to build up and strengthen the
class movement of the proletariat, ridding it of all petty-bourgeois
admixtures, restrictions, narrowness and distortions. The working class
lives side by side with the petty bourgeoisie, which, as it becomes ruined,
provides increasing numbers of new recruits to the ranks of the
proletariat. And Russia is the most petty-bourgeois, the most philistine of
capitalist countries, which only now is passing through the period of
bourgeois revolutions which Britain, for example, passed through in the
seventeenth century, and France in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries.  

The class-conscious workers, who are now tackling a job that is near
and dear to them, that of running the working-class

    

press, putting it on a sound basis and strengthening and developing it,
will not forget the twenty-year history of Marxism and the
Social-Democratic press in Russia.  

A disservice is being done to the workers’ movement by those of its
weak-nerved friends among the intelligentsia who fight shy of the internal
struggle among the Social-Democrats, and who fill the air with cries and
calls to have nothing to do with it. They are well-meaning but futile
people, and their outcries are futile.  

Only by studying the history of Marxism’s struggle against opportunism,
only by making a thorough and detailed study of the manner in which
independent proletarian democracy emerged from the petty-bourgeois
hodge-podge can the advanced workers decisively strengthen their own
class-consciousness and their workers’ press.

[2]
The Russian word Menshevism is derived from menshinstvo, the
English for which is minority—Ed.  
 



[3]
Decembrists—Russian revolutionaries of the nobility who
fought against serfdom and the autocracy. They raised an armed revolt on
December 14, 1825.





[4]
Kolokol (The Bell)—a political journal published
under the motto Vivos voco! (I call on the living!) by
A. I. Herzen and N. P. Ogaryov from July 1, 1857 to April 1865 in London,
and from May 1865 to July 1867 in Geneva. Published as a monthly and for
some time as a fortnightly, it put out 245 issues. In 1868 the journal was
published in French (15 issues in all) with an occasional supplement in
Russian. Kolokol, which was published in 2,500 copies and
circulated throughout Russia, exposed the tyranny of the autocracy, the
extortion and embezzlement practised by the government officials, and the
ruthless exploitation of the peasants by the landlords. Kolokol
addressed revolutionary calls to the masses, rousing them to the struggle
against the tsarist government and the ruling classes.  

The leading organ of the revolutionary uncensored press and the
precursor of the working-class press in Russia, Kolokol played an
important role in the development of the general democratic and
revolutionary movement, in the struggle against the autocracy and serfdom.





[5]
Belinsky’s Letter to Gogol was written in July 1847, and first
published in 1855 in Herzen’s Polyarnaya Zvezda (The Pole
Star).





[6]
Narodism—a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian
revolutionary movement, which arose between the sixties and seventies of
the nineteenth century. The Narodniks were out to abolish the autocracy

   

and hand over the landed estates to the peasantry. At the same time they
denied the tendency towards the development of capitalist relations in
Russia, and consequently, considered the peasantry, not the proletariat,
the principal revolutionary force. They regarded the village commune as the
embryo of socialism. In their endeavour to rouse the peasants to the
struggle against the autocracy, the Narodniks went into the villages,
“among the people”, but they met no support there.  

In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks adopted a policy of
conciliation with tsarism. They expressed the interests of the kulaks and
waged a fierce struggle against Marxism.





[7]
The reference is to the First Congress of the R. S. D. L. P.
held in Minsk on March 1–3 (13–15), 1898. The Congress was attended by
nine delegates from six organisations: the St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Ekaterinoslav and Kiev Leagues of Struggle for the Emancipation of the
Working Class, from the Kiev Rabochaya Gazeta group and from the
Bund. The Congress elected a Central Committee of the Party, confirmed
Rabochaya Gazeta as the Party’s official organ, published a
Manifesto, and proclaimed the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad the
foreign representative of the Party.  

The First Congress of the R. S. D. L. P. was significant in that it
adopted decisions and a Manifesto proclaiming the establishment of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, thereby playing an important role
in the matter of revolutionary propaganda. The Congress, however, did not
adopt a Programme or draft Party Rules. The Central Committee elected at
the Congress was soon arrested and the printing-press of Rabochaya
Gazeta was seized, thus making it impossible for the Congress to unite
and establish contact between the various Marxist circles and
organisations. There was no single central leadership and no single line in
the work of the local organisations.





[8]
St. Petersburg Rabochy Listok (St. Petersburg Workers’
Bulletin)—organ of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the
Emancipation of the Working Class. Two issues appeared—No. 1 in February
(dated January) 1897 mimeographed in Russia in 300—400 copies, and No. 2
in September 1897 in Geneva in printed form.  

The newspaper put forward the task of combining the economic struggle
of the working class With broad political demands, and stressed the need
for creating a workers’ party.





[9]
Rabotnik (The Worker)—a non-periodical symposium
published abroad in 1896-99 by the Union of Russian Social-Democrats under
the editorship of the Emancipation of Labour group. The symposium was
issued on the initiative of Lenin who, during his journey abroad in 1895,
made arrangements with Plekhanov and Axelrod for the symposium to be edited
and published by the Emancipation of Labour group. On his return to Russia
Lenin did much to organise support for this publication and have articles
and correspondence

   

sent to it from Russia. Before his arrest in December 1895 Lenin had
prepared and forwarded to Rabotnik an obituary article “Frederick
Engels” and several items of correspondence, some of which (those from
A. A. Vaneyev, M. A. Silvin, and S. P. Shesternin) were published in
No. 1–2 and No. 5–6 of the symposium.  

Altogether six issues of Rabotnik were published in three
books, and 10 issues of Listok Rabotnika.





[10]
Vperyod (Forward)—an illegal Bolshevik weekly published in
Geneva from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1905) to May 5(18),
1905. Eighteen issues were put out. Its organiser, manager and guiding
spirit was Lenin. Other members of the editorial board were V. V. Vorovsky,
A. V. Lunacharsky, and M. S. Olminsky. All correspondence, including that
of the local committees in Russia; was handled by N. K. Krupskaya. Lenin
defined the content of the newspaper in the following words: =

“The line of Vperyod is the line of the old
‘Iskra’. In the name of the old Iskra, Vperyod
resolutely combats the new Iskra.” (See present edition, Vol. 8,
p. 130.) Besides leading articles, Lenin wrote numerous paragraphs for
Vperyod and rewrote items of correspondence. Some articles were
written by Lenin in co-operation with other members of the editorial board
(Vorovsky, Olminsky and others). Over sixty articles and minor items by
Lenin were published in Vperyod. Some issues of the newspaper,
e. g., Nos. 4 and 5, which dealt with the events of January 9(22), 1905,
and the beginning of the revolution in Russia, were written almost entirely
by Lenin. His articles in Vperyod were often reprinted in the
local Bolshevik press and published in the form of leaflets and pamphlets.


The outstanding role which the newspaper played in combating
Menshevism, reasserting the Party principle, formulating and elucidating
the issues posed by the rising revolution, and fighting for a congress to
be convened, was acknowledged in a special resolution of the Third Party
Congress, which recorded a vote of thanks to the editorial hoard. By a
decision of the Third Congress the newspaper Vperyod was
superceded by Proletary.  

Proletary (The Proletarian)—an illegal Bolshevik
weekly, Central Organ of the R. S. D. L. P., founded in accordance with a
resolution of the Third Party Congress. By a decision of the plenary
meeting of the Party Central Committee of April 27 (May 10), 1905, Lenin
was appointed Editor-in-Chief. Proletary was published in Geneva
from May 14 (27) to November 12 (25), 1905. Twenty-six issues were put out.


Proletary carried on the line of the old, Leninist,
Iskra and preserved complete continuity with the Bolshevik
newspaper Vperyod.  

Lenin wrote about ninety articles and paragraphs for the newspaper. His
articles determined the paper’s political character, its ideological
message and Bolshevik trend. Lenin bore a heavy burden of the work on the
newspaper as manager and editor, receiving regular assistance from the
other members of the editorial board—Vorovsky, Lunacharsky and Olminsky.



Proletary reacted immediately to all important events in the
Russian and international labour movement, and waged a relent less struggle
against the Mensheviks and other opportunist revisionist elements. The
newspaper did a great deal to propagandise the decisions of the Third Party
Congress, and played an important part in rallying the Bolsheviks
organisationally and ideologically. Proletary consistently
advocated revolutionary Marxism and formulated all the basic issues
involved in the rising revolution in Russia. The newspaper highlighted the
events of 1905 and roused the broad masses of the working people to the
struggle for the victory of the revolution.  

Proletary gave a good deal of attention to the local
Social-Democratic organisations. Some of Lenin’s articles in this newspaper
were reprinted by the local Bolshevik newspapers and distributed in leaflet
form. Proletary suspended publication shortly after Lenin’s
departure for Russia early in November 1905. The last two issues (Nos. 25
and 26) were edited by Vorovsky, but even these contained several articles
by Lenin, which were published after his departure from Geneva.





[11]
Novaya Zhizn (New Life)—the first legal Bolshevik
newspaper, published as a St. Petersburg daily from October 27 (November 9)
to December 3 (16), 1905. Lenin took over the editorship upon his return to
Russia early in November. Novaya Zhizn was virtually the Central
Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. Closely associated with the paper were
V. V. Vorovsky, M. S. Olminsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and others. Maxim Gorky
was an active contributor to the paper, to which he gave substantial
financial aid.  

Issue No. 9 of the paper for November 10, 1905 carried Lenin’s first
article “The Reorganisation of the Party”, which was followed by more
than ten articles from his pen. The paper’s circulation reached 80 000,
despite constant persecution. Fifteen of the paper’s twenty-seven issues
were confiscated and destroyed. It was banned after publication of issue
No. 27 on December 2 (15), No. 28 being put out illegally.





[12]
Nachalo (The Beginning)—a legal Menshevik daily
published in St. Petersburg from November 13 (26) to December 2 (15),
1905. Sixteen issues came out. The editors and publishers of the news paper
were D. M. Herzenstein and S. N. Saltykov, and among the contributors were
P. B. Axelrod, F. I. Dan, L. G. Deutsch, N. I.Yordansky, L. Martov, and
A. N. Potresov.





[13]
Volna (The Wave)—a legal Bolshevik daily published
in St. Petersburg from April 26 (May 9) to May 24 (June 6),
1906. Twenty-five issues were put out. Beginning with No. 9 for May 5 (15),
1906 (after the close of the Fourth Congress and Lenin’s arrival from
Stockholm) the paper was virtually edited by Lenin. Some twenty-five
articles by him were published in the paper. Others on the editorial staff
were V. V. Vorovsky and M. S. Olminsky. Volna was subjected to
frequent police repressions and was eventually

   

closed down by the tsarist government. Its place was taken by the legal
Bolshevik paper Vperyod.  

Ekho (The Echo)—a legal Bolshevik daily published
in St. Petersburg from June 22 (July 5) to July 7 (20), 1906 in place of
the suppressed newspaper Vperyod. Fourteen issues were put
out. Actually the paper was edited by Lenin, whose articles appeared in
every issue. Lenin also conducted the “Book and Magazine” section.  

Almost every issue of the newspaper was subjected to repressions,
twelve of the fourteen issues being seized by the police.





[14]
Narodnaya Duma (People’s Duma)—a Menshevik daily
published in St. Petersburg in March–April 1907 in place of the suppressed
Russkaya Zhizn. Twenty-one issues of the paper came out.

Karl Legien, one of the most prominent and responsible
representatives of the German trade unions, recently published a report of
his visit to America in the form of a rather bulky hook entitled The
Labour Movement in America.  

As a very prominent representative of the international as well as
German trade union movement, K. Legien gave his visit the nature of a
special occasion, one of state-importance, one might say. For years he
conducted negotiations on this visit with the Socialist Party of America
and the American Federation of Labour, the labour-union organisation led by
the famous (or rather infamous) Gompers. When Legien heard that Karl
Liebknecht was going to America, he refused to go at the same time “so as
to avoid the simultaneous appearance in the United States of two spokesmen
whose views on the party’s tactics and on the importance and value of
certain branches of the labour movement did not entirely coincide”.  

K. Legien collected a vast amount of material on the labour-union
movement in America, but failed to digest it in his book, which is
cluttered up with patchy descriptions of his journey, trivial in content
and trite in style. Even the labour-union rules of America, in which Legien
was particularly interested, are not studied or analysed, but merely
translated incompletely and without system.  

There was a highly instructive episode in Legien’s tour, which
strikingly revealed the two tendencies in the inter national and
particularly in the German labour movement.  

Legien visited the chamber of deputies of the United States, known as
the Congress. Brought up in the police-ridden Prussian state, he was favourably impressed by the democratic customs of
the Republic, and he remarks with understandable pleasure that in America
the government provides every congressman not only with a private office
fitted with all modern conveniences, but also with a paid secretary to help
him cope with a congressman’s manifold duties. The simplicity and easy
manners of the congressmen and the Speaker of the House were in striking
contrast with what Legien had seen in European parliaments, and especially
in Germany. In Europe, a Social-Democrat could not even think of delivering
to a bourgeois parliament at an official session a speech of greeting! But
in America this was done very simply, and the name of Social-Democrat did
not frighten anybody... except that Social-Democrat himself!


We have here an example of the American bourgeois method of killing
unsteady socialists with kindness, and the German opportunist method of
renouncing socialism in deference to the “kindly”, suave and democratic
bourgeoisie.  

Legien’s speech of greeting was translated into English (democracy was
not in the least averse to hearing a “foreign” language spoken in its
parliament); all two hundred odd congressmen shook hands in turn with
Legien as the “guest” of the Republic, and the speaker expressed his
thanks.  


   “The form and content of my speech of greeting,” writes
   Legien, “were sympathetically received by the socialist press both in the
   United States and Germany. Certain editors in Germany, however, could not
   resist pointing out that my speech proved once again what an impossible
   task it is for a Social-Democrat to deliver a Social-Democratic speech to a
   bourgeois audience. Well, in my place, these editors would, no doubt, have
   delivered a speech against capitalism and in favour of a mass strike, but I
   considered it important to emphasise to this parliament that the
   Social-Democratic and industrially organised workers of Germany want peace
   among the nations, and through peace, the development of culture to the
   highest degree attainable.”  


Poor “editors”, whom our Legien has annihilated with his
“statesmanlike” speech! The opportunism of trade union leaders in
general, and of Legien in particular, has long been common knowledge in the
German labour movement, and has been duly appraised by a great many
class-conscious workers. But with us in Russia, where far too much is spoken about the
“model” of European socialism with precisely the worst, most
objectionable features of this “model” being chosen, it would be
advisable to deal with Legien’s speech in somewhat greater detail.  

When he addressed the highest body of representatives of capitalist
America, this leader of a two-million-strong army of German trade
unionists—namely, the Social-Democratic trade unions—this member of the
Social-Democratic group in the German Reichstag, delivered a purely
liberal, bourgeois speech. Needless to say, not a single liberal, not even
an Octobrist, would hesitate to subscribe to a speech about “peace” and
“culture”.  

And when German socialists remarked that this was not a
Social-Democratic speech, this “leader” of capital’s wage-slaves treated
them with scathing contempt. What are “editors” compared to a “practical
politician” and collector of workers’ pennies! Our philistine Narcissus
has the same contempt for editors as the police panjandrums in a certain
country have for the third
element.[1] 

“These editors” would no doubt have delivered a speech “against
capitalism”.  

Just think what this quasi-socialist is sneering at! He is sneering at
the idea that a socialist should think it necessary to speak
against capitalism. To the “statesmen” of German opportunism
such an idea is utterly alien; they talk in such a way as not to
offend “capitalism”. Disgracing themselves by this servile
renunciation of socialism, they brag of their disgrace.  

Legien is not just anybody. He is a representative of the army of trade
unions, or rather, the officers’ corps of that army. His speech was no
accident, no slip of the tongue, no casual whimsy, no blunder of a
provincial German office clerk overawed by American capitalists, who were
polite and revealed no trace of police arrogance. If it were only
this, Legien’s speech would not be worthy of note.  

But it was obviously not that.  

At the International Congress in Stuttgart, half the German delegation
turned out to be sham socialists of this type, who voted for the
ultra-opportunist resolution on the colonial
question.[2] 
 

Take the German magazine Sozialistische (??)
Monatshefte[3] and you will always find in it utterances by
men like Legien, which are thoroughly opportunist, and have
nothing in common with socialism, utterances touching on
all the vital issues of the labour movement.  

The “official” explanation of the “official” German party is that
“nobody reads” Sozialistische Monatshefte, that it has no
influence, etc.; but that is not true. The Stuttgart “incident”
proved that it is not true. The most prominent and responsible people,
members of parliament and trade union leaders who write for
Sozialistische Monatshefte, constantly and undeviatingly propagate
their views among the masses.  

The “official optimism” of the German party has long been noted in
its own camp by those people who earned Legien’s appellation of “these
editors”—an appellation contemptuous from the point of view of the
bourgeois and honourable from the point of view of a socialist. And the
more often the liberals and the liquidators in Russia (including Trotsky,
of course) attempt to transplant this amiable characteristic
to our soil, the more determinedly must they be resisted.  

German Social-Democracy has many great services to its credit. Thanks
to Marx’s struggle against all the Höchbergs, Dührings, and Co., it
possesses a strictly formulated theory, which our Narodniks vainly try to
evade or touch up along opportunist lines. It has a mass organisation,
newspapers, trade unions, political associations—that same mass
organisation which is so definitely building up in our country in the shape
of the victories the Pravda Marxists are winning everywhere—in
Duma elections, in the daily press, in Insurance Board elections, and in
the trade unions. The attempts of our liquidators, whom the workers have
“removed from office”, to evade tho question of the growth of this mass
organisation in Russia in a form adapted to Russian conditions are as vain
as those of the Narodniks, and imply a similar intellectualist
breakaway from the working-class movement.  

But the merits of German Social-Democracy are merits, not because of
shameful speeches like those delivered by Legien or the “utterances” (in
the press) by the contributors to Sozialistische Monatshefte, but despite them. We must
not try to play down the disease which the German party is
undoubtedly suffering from, and which reveals itself in phenomena of this
kind; nor must we play it down with “officially optimistic” phrases. We
must lay it bare to the Russian workers, so that we may learn from the
experience of the older movement, learn what should not be copied from it.


 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the tsarist bureaucracy’s attitude towards the
democratic Zemstvo personnel —doctors, technicians, statisticians,
teachers, agriculturists, etc., called the “third element” in a speech
made in 1900 by the Samara Deputy Governor-General Kondoidi. The expression
was subsequently used in literature to designate the Zemstvo democratic
intelligentsia.





[2]
Lenin refers to the International Socialist Congress in
Stuttgart (the Seventh Congress of the Second International) held in
August 1907. One of the principal items on the agenda was the colonial
question, over which a sharp struggle was waged at the Congress. The
opportunist section of the Congress moved a resolution justifying colonial
conquests. The Dutch “socialist” Van Kol made a statement to the effect
that in future socialists should go to “the savage peoples” not only with
machines and other achievements of culture, but with weapons in their
hands. The opportunist draft resolution was supported by the majority of
the German delegation. Only as a result of the efforts of the Russian and
Polish socialists, a small part of the German, French and British
socialists, as well as of all the socialists of the small countries owning
no colonies, was this resolution defeated, and amendments adopted to it
which practically changed its whole tenor. The resolution on the colonial
question adopted by the Congress plainly and unreservedly condemned every
kind of colonial policy.

Sozialistische Monatshefte (Socialist Monthly)—the
chief organ of the German opportunists and a mouthpiece of international
revisionism, published in Berlin from 1897 to 1933. During World War I
(1914–18) it took a social-chauvinist stand.

This bulky tome of 930 large pages of very small type, printed partly
in double columns, is an “attempt to review Russian book treasures in
connection with the history of scientific-philosophical and literary-social
ideas”. Thus runs the subtitle of the book.  

The second volume, which we are here reviewing, covers the various
fields of the social sciences. This includes, among others, socialism in
Western Europe as well as in Russia. A publication of this type is
obviously of great interest, and the author’s plan is on the whole a
correct one. It is really impossible to give a sensible “review
of Russian book treasures” and a “work of reference” for self-education
and libraries otherwise than in connection with the history of ideas. What
is needed here is “preliminary remarks” to every section (these the
author provides) with a general survey of the subject and an accurate
summary of each ideological trend, as well as a list of books for
the particular section and for each ideological trend.  

The author and his numerous collaborators, as mentioned in the preface,
have expended an enormous amount of labour and started an extremely
valuable undertaking, which deserves from us the cordial wish that it may
grow and develop in scope and depth. Very valuable, among other things, is
the fact that the author excludes neither foreign publications nor
publications that have been prosecuted. No decent library can dispense with
Mr. Rubakin’s work.  

The faults of this book are its author’s eclecticism and the fact that
he does not sufficiently enlist, or rather, that

    

he has barely begun to enlist, the co-operation of specialists on definite
subjects.  

The first fault is perhaps due to the author’s peculiar aversion for
“polemics”. In his preface, Mr. Rubakin says:
“Never in my life have I taken part in any polemics, for I believe that in
the overwhelming majority of cases polemics are one of the best means of
obscuring the truth with all sorts of human emotions.” The author does not
realise, for one thing, that there has never been, nor can there be, any
human search for truth without “human emotions”. The author
forgets, secondly, that he has set out to review “the history of ideas”,
and the history of ideas is that of the succession, and
consequently of the conflict of ideas.  

One of the two—either we ignore the conflict of ideas, in
which case it is rather difficult to undertake a review of its history (let
alone participate in this conflict), or else we abandon the claim
“never to take part in any polemics”. For example: I turn to
Mr. Rubakin’s “preliminary remarks” on the theory of political economy
and at once see that the author escapes from this dilemma firstly by means
of veiled polemics (a form that has all the demerits of polemics
and none of its great merits), and, secondly, by defending eclecticism.


In his outline of Bogdanov’s Short Course, Mr. Rubakin
“ventures”, to note the “interesting” similarity between one of the
deductions made by the “Marxist” author and “N. K. Mikhailovsky’s
well-known formula of progress” (p. 815).  

0, Mr. Rubakin, who says, “Never in my life have I taken part in any
polemics”....  

On the preceding page he eulogises the “strictly scientific method,
profound analysis and critical attitude towards extremely important
theories” of—who would you think?—that exemplary eclecticist
Mr. Tugan-Baranovsky! Mr. Rubakin himself is compelled to admit that this
professor is somewhat of an adherent of Marxism, somewhat of an adherent of
Narodism and somewhat of an adherent of the “theory of marginal
utility”,[2] and yet calls him a “socialist”! Does not writing a
monstrous thing like this amount to indulging in polemics of the
worst kind against socialism?  
 

Had Mr. Rubakin divided the 14,000 odd words (i.e., a whole pamphlet)
which he wrote as an introduction to the literature on political economy,
into four parts, and had he arranged to have them written by, say, a
Black-Hundred-man, a liberal, a Narodnik, and a Marxist, we would have had
a more public polemic, and 999 readers out of a thousand would
have discovered the truth a thousand times more easily and quickly.  

Mr. Rubakin has resorted to this kind of device—that of enlisting the
co-operation of representatives of “polemics”—in the question of
Bolshevism and Menshevism, and devoted half a page to
  me[1]

and another half to L. Martov. As far as I am concerned, I am quite
satisfied with L. Martov’s exposition, for example, with his admission that
liquidationism amounts to attempts “at creating a legal workers’ party”,
and to “a negative attitude to surviving underground organisations”
(pp. 771–72), or with his admission that “Menshevism saw no other way in
which the proletariat could take a useful part in the crisis” (i.e., that
of 1905) “except by helping the bourgeois liberal democrats in their
attempts to eject the reactionary section of the propertied classes from
political power—but while rendering this assistance, the proletariat was
to maintain its complete political independence” (772).  

As soon as Mr. Rubakin continues this outline of Menshevism on his own,
he falls into error—for example, his assertion that Axelrod
“withdrew” from liquidationism together with Plekhanov
(772). While we do not blame Mr. Rubakin very much for such errors, which
are inevitable in the initial stages of a work of this varied and
compilatory nature, yet we cannot help wishing that the author would more
often employ the method of enlisting the co-operation of representatives of
the different trends in all fields of knowledge. This would make
for greater accuracy and completeness of the work, as well as for its
impartiality; only eclecticism and veiled polemics stand
to lose by this.

[2]
The theory of “marginal utility” was advanced by
the Austrian school at the end of the nineteenth century in opposition to
the Marxian theory of labour value. This school was a species of vulgar
political economy, but unlike some of the latter’s exponents, it determined
the value of a commodity, not simply by its utility, but by the utility of
the final (marginal) unit of stock of the given

   

commodity which satisfies the least urgent needs of a person. In substance,
the theory of “marginal utility”, like the sum total of the economic and
philosophical tenets of the Austrian school, was merely an attempt to gloss
over the essential nature of exploitation under capitalism.

Headers of our paper are aware what a great deal of controversy and
conflict liquidationism is causing in the working class movement of Russia
today. We have repeatedly pointed out that every class-conscious worker (in
a sense, we would even say every politically-conscious democrat) must have
a clear and definite understanding of liquidationism.  

Nonetheless, our opponents in both Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta
and Nasha Zarya not only fail to publish in full and explain to
their readers the gist of the official decisions dealing with
liquidationism (for example, from the texts of 1908 and 1910), but, what is
far worse and far more harmful, they either flatly “deny” the existence
of liquidationism, or else mouth incoherent irrelevancies, instead
of accurately reporting the decision unanimously adopted in
1910.  

We therefore consider it necessary to take advantage of such a rare
occasion as that afforded by L. Martov himself, who has given in
the press an astonishingly (for this writer) exact and truthful definition
or description of liquidationism.  

In Volume II of N. Rubakin’s well-known book Among Books
(second edition, Moscow, 1913, p. 771) we find that Mr. Rubakin has
published without the slightest alteration a letter from L. Martov replying
to Mr. Rubakin’s request “to set forth the gist and history of
Menshevism”. In this letter L. Martov writes literally the following: 


   “After the social movement was crushed, the same
   tendency of the Mensheviks [namely, the tendency “to start party
   construction anew in a more definite class-socialist spirit or to give
   Social-Democracy a new basis for its radical self-reformation”] towards
   the organisational reform of the Party found expression in increased
   activities aimed at the formation of all kinds of non-party labour
   organisations—trade unions, self-education societies (in some cases,
   co-operative

    

   societies), etc., and in attempts, through these societies, to form a
   legal workers’ party, or organised outposts of it [in the course of
   the controversy, those who took part in these attempts were dubbed
   “legalists” or “liquidators” because of their negative
   attitude towards the surviving underground organisations].”  


This is all that Martov had to say about liquidationism. We have
underlined the principal passages. We shall not dwell on the minor
misstatement that it was only “in the course of the controversy” and that
only “those who took part in these attempts” who were called liquidators;
as a matter of fact, the general Marxist, official decision of 1908, which
is binding on all Marxists, speaks of liquidationism as a definite
trend. But that is a relatively minor point.  

The major point is that L. Martov has here unwittingly revealed that he
understands and knows what liquidationism is.  

Attempts to form a legal workers’ party and of course advocacy and
defence of this idea; a negative attitude to wards the organisations of the
“old type” which still survive (and, naturally, may arise anew)—such is
the crux of the matter, which Nasha Zarya, Luch, and
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta have tried a thousand times to confuse,
obscure and deny.  

The reader who gives thought to the significance of the facts we have
quoted will realise why the mere mention of “unity” by the liquidators is
capable of arousing, in class-conscious workers, either violent indignation
and protest, or (according to their mood) scathing ridicule. One can
conceive of an advocate of the legal-party idea sincerely and honestly
repudiating the “underground”, if those are his convictions. But one
cannot conceive of sincere and honest talk about “unity” on the
part of those who contribute to Nasha Zarya or Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta. To write for these journals means, in
effect, to fight against the “underground” and for
a legal party, which they continue to advocate and stand up for.  

Therefore, when the International Socialist Bureau, in December 1913,
brought up the question of ascertaining the conditions on which unity could
be achieved in Russia, the organised Marxists in St. Petersburg and Moscow
at once

    

publicly declared that the primary and basic condition was emphatic and
unqualified rejection of liquidationism, a complete and radical change in
the entire trend of the Nasha Zarya and Luch
group. The Luch people answered, also publicly (both F. D. and
L.M.), that they did not agree with this.  

That being the case, it is obvious that people who talk about “unity”
with this group, which persists in its liberal ideas, are deceiving both
themselves and others. Real unity has already been developed and will
continue to be developed among the majority of the class-conscious workers,
who have rallied round the Marxist decisions and round the entire Marxist
body, against this splitting group.

Liquidationism is an issue of vital importance, not only to
labour democracy but to Russian democracy generally. When our democratic
press tries to sidestep this issue, or skim over it as a “private
controversy” among Marxists, it merely reveals a desire to evade an
appraisal of the cardinal political problems of our day. For the question
of liquidationism is one of our entire appraisal of the June Third system,
and, in broader terms, of our counter-revolution generally. It is a
question of the basic tasks and methods of the democrats.  

No one, I believe, has questioned the fact that the latest period of
Russian history, beginning approximately with 1908, has been marked not
only by the extreme intensification of reaction’s persecution of everything
democratic, but by profound ideological disunity and disintegration, which
has affected the proletariat as well as all bourgeois-democratic
elements. But whereas everyone acknowledges this obvious fact,
only the Marxists have set themselves the clear and immediate task of
precisely defining the class roots and class implications
of this disunity and disintegration. Without such a definition there can be
no conscious choice of tactics.  

Work in that direction started in our Marxist press abroad in 1908,
i.e., as soon as disunity became a fact. The Marxists could not accept this
disunity, as the liberals had done, nor could they confine themselves to
subjectively condemning it, as even the best (in the democratic sense) of
the Narodniks had done. The social trends called for a socio economic,
i.e., class explanation.  
 

December 1908 saw an explanation of the substance of Liquidationism
given in the Bolshevik press and endorsed by a Party decision which was
binding on all. The spring of 1909 saw a formal break between the
Bolsheviks (as represented by their leading body) and the so-called
     Vperyodists,[1]

who accepted
otzovism[6] or considered it a “legitimate trend” and defended
“god-building” and the reactionary philosophy of

      Machism.[2]

This break revealed the main features of “Left liquidationism”, its
leaning towards anarchism, just as Right liquidationism, or liquidationism
proper, leans towards liberalism.  

By January 1910 this Marxist analysis of the present disunity and
disintegration, nine-tenths of which had been given by the Bolshevik press
abroad, was so complete and the facts so irrefutably established, that
all Marxists, representatives of all trends (including
both the liquidators and the Vperyodists) were compelled
unanimously to acknowledge, in the decisions of January 1910, that
both the liquidationist and Vperyodist “deviations” were
manifestations of bourgeois influence on the proletariat.  

A glance at the situation in the non-Marxist movement will be enough to
make one realise the social significance of this Marxist analysis and
Marxist decision. Among the liberals we find the extreme Vekhist
liquidationism and confusion, which persists to this day, on the
question of whether the methods of 1905 have been abandoned or not. Among
the Left Narodniks we find extreme liquidationist pronouncements,
beginning with the Paris publications of 1908–11, the nebulous
liquidationism of
Pochin[7] and ending with the liquidationist mouthings of
Savinkov-Ropshin and Chernov in Zavety. On the other hand, the
Left Narodniks’ official otzovism continues to erode and weaken their
ranks.  

The objective validity of the Marxist analysis was confirmed by the
fact that in the course of the five odd years since 1908 all
progressive trends of social thought have been constantly coming up against
these selfsame liquidationist and Narodnik errors, these
selfsame questions of applying old methods to the solution of old but still

    

unresolved problems, and of marshalling our forces in a new situation and
with new methods.  

At the beginning of the June Third period, Marxist analysis helped to
reveal the theoretical deviations towards liquidationism and otzovism. Now,
at the close of the period, we see how, even in the open arena, in full
sight of everybody, the vast majority of class-conscious workers of Russia
have rallied around the Marxists, while both flanks of the
democratic press, which seeks to influence the proletariat, are preoccupied
with petty-bourgeois liquidationism and petty-bourgeois Narodism. Not so
long ago the Left-Narodnik Severnaya Mysl (No. 1) carried the
following report from a Mr. Braines on the social insurance campaign in
Riga: 


   “The boycottist trend is a p parent only among the
   shoemakers, where boycottist groups have been formed. Unfortunately, the
   Narodniks are the leading spirits in these groups.” (Quoted in the article
   “Narodism and Liquidationism as Disintegrating Elements in the
   Working-Class
     Movement”,[3]

   in Proletarskaya Pravda No. 12, for December 20, 1913.)  


The same paper had to admit that: 


   “To the honour of the Marxists be it said that they
   enjoy considerable influence at present in the unions [i.e., the trade
   unions] whereas we Left Narodniks work in them without a definite plan, and
   for that reason our influence is scarcely felt.” (Ibid.)  


The doctrinal feebleness of the Left Narodniks, who combine the
new-fangled opportunism of the European philistines with the purely Russian
philistine defence of “labouring” proprietors, is naturally complemented
by tactical feebleness and vacillation. Nothing remains of the old
Left-Narodnik party except vacillation, and the same applies to the
liquidators. Defeated in the working-class movement, these petty-bourgeois
trends had no choice but to form a bloc against the Marxists.


It has been a steady descent. From advocacy of a legal party, from the
speeches of the Potresovs and the Yushkeviches, with their renouncement of
the idea of hegemony and of Marxism, the liquidators have sunk to a direct
struggle against the Marxist party. Here is what a St. Petersburg
Left Narodnik wrote the other day in Stoikaya Mysl (No. 5): 
 


   “As soon as we came into the hall (where the election of
   the Insurance Board was taking place) the narrow factional stand taken by
   the Pravdists at once became clear. But we do not lose hope. Together with
   the liquidators we are drawing up a non-factional list that will give us
   one seat on the Board and two alternate seats.” (Quoted from Put
   Pravdy No. 38, for March 16, 1914.)  


Petty-bourgeois democrats of all trends who wish to corrupt the workers
with bourgeois influence—unite against the Marxists! The silly word
“non-factional”, which fascinates people who are incapable of thinking
and learning, is so convenient and pleasing a word for the philistine! But
the hoc with the Left Narodniks was no help to the poor liquidators, and
never can be. The class-conscious workers elected to the Insurance Board
only Marxists, opponents of liquidationism.  

Grouplets of non-Party Intellectuals, who seek to subject the workers
to bourgeois policy and bourgeois ideology, have now taken definite shape
in Russia: the liquidators and the Left Narodniks. For nearly twenty years,
ever since Economism first appeared on the scene (1894–95), the ground has
been laid for this alliance of opportunists from among the
near-Party Marxists with the Narodniks, against consistent
Marxism. It is high time to face the facts squarely and say firmly and
emphatically: the Marxist working-class movement in Russia is being built,
and can be built, only in a struggle against liquidationism and
Narodism.  

All over the world, in every capitalist society, the proletariat is
inevitably connected with the petty bourgeoisie by a thousand ties, and
everywhere the period of formation of workers’ parties was attended by its
more or less prolonged and persistent ideological and political subjection
to the bourgeoisie. This is common to all capitalist countries, but it
assumes different forms in different countries, depending on historical and
economic factors: In Britain, in conditions of complete political freedom
and with the country enjoying a long period of monopoly, the liberal
bourgeoisie was for decades able to corrupt and ideologically enslave the
majority of class-conscious workers. In France, the traditions of
republican petty-bourgeois radicalism have been converting very many
workers into supporters of the “Radical”

    

bourgeois party, or of equally bourgeois anarchism. In Germany, half a
century ago, the workers still followed the liberal Schulze-Delitzsch and
were taken in by the “national liberal” (“Royal-Prussian”)
opportunistic vacillation of Lassalle and Schweitzer, while today hundreds
of thousands of workers follow the Catholic “centre”, with its sham
“democracy”.  

In Russia, the bourgeois-democratic solution of the peas ant
question has not been completed to this day. It is therefore not surprising
to see petty-bourgeois Narodism parading as “socialism”. Russia is the
most petty bourgeois of all capitalist countries. Consequently, as
soon as Marxism became a mass social trend in Russia,
intellectualist petty-bourgeois opportunism made itself felt, first in the
form of Economism and “legal Marxism” (1895-1902), later in the form of
      Menshevism[4]

(1903-08), and finally in the form of liquidationism (1908–14).  

Liquidationism has now reached full maturity, a complete break with the
Marxist workers’ party. If Mr. L. M., the most
“Left” of the liquidators—and the most adroit in producing evasive
formulas—writes: 


   “experience has shown that the ‘legal workers’ party’ is
   not a reactionary dream, for such a party, in a certain sense,
   exists in Russia at present...” (L. M.’s italics; Nasha
   Zarya No. 2, 1914, p. 83), 


then it should be clear to all that it is
absurd and preposterous even to think of the possibility of
“uniting” or “reconciling” such a group with the Marxist
workers’ party.  

Only hopelessly empty-headed people can now talk of the Marxist
workers’ party “uniting” with such a group, with that of
Nasha Zarya and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta group.  
 

Class divisions in Russia in 1914 are in every respect more politically
definite and sharper than they were in 1904. At that time it was only the
landed nobility that showed no cleavage, and the salon liberalism of some
of its representatives frightened even the old regime. At that time, this
regime considered the muzhik such a reliable pillar of law and order that
it allowed him a very large measure of influence in the Bulygin and Witte
Dumas.[8] At that time, Guchkov-Milyukov-Peshekhonov liberalism and
democracy could still present a single and uniform school of thought. At
that time Menshevism wanted to be—and in effect was—an
inner-Party trend, one that sought to defend opportunist slogans
in “programmatic discussions” within the workers’ party.  

Present-day liquidationism has since then moved miles to the right. It
has quitted the Party, shaken the dust of the “underground” from its
feet, and is a closely knit anti-partyist centre of journalists writing for
the legal liberal and liquidationist press, men whom the workers have
removed from every office in all working-class organisations and
societies. To compare this liquidationism with the Menshevism of
1903–07 is to allow oneself to be blinded and deafened by old names and
catchwords, and to have absolutely no understanding of the evolution of
class and party relations in Russia during the past ten years.  

Present-day liquidationism, that of 1914, is the same as the
Tovarishch group of
1907.[9] 

It is quite natural that in exile and emigration, where people are so
out of touch with real conditions, so immured in memories of the past, of
the events of seven or ten years ago, one comes across dozens of these
“have-beens”, who dream of “unity” between the workers’ party and the
group of Messrs. L. M., F. D., Potresov, Yezhov, Sedov and Co. And there
are also very many of these “have-beens”, but of a poorer moral calibre,
among intellectuals associated with the workers’ party in 1904–07 and now
holding “cushy jobs” in various legal organisations.  

No less natural is it that among Russian working-class youth of today
all these dreams and all this talk of complacent individuals about
“unity” of liquidators and the workers’ party produce either Homeric and
most impolite

    

laughter, or else bewilderment and pity for these intellectualist
Manilovs. This is perfectly natural, for our present-day working-class
youth have seen the liquidators desert the Party, seen their
flight from the “defunct Party cells”, beard their renegade
speeches about the “underground” and the harmfulness of “boosting the
illegal Press” (see statement in Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta,
March 13, 1914), have been obliged to combat the bloc of this
gentry both with the Narodniks and with the non-party element at a number
of congresses, in the elections to the Fourth Duma, at a number of meetings
of workers’ societies, and in the elections to the Insurance Board, and
have been obliged to remove these individuals from office
in every workers’ organisation.  

Let Trotsky, in Borba, cast imploring looks at Skobelev and
Chkheidze; let contributors to the Paris newspaper Za
     Partiyu[5]
[10]

look with hope and trust to
Buryanov[11]; let them reiterate all this talk about “unity”—their
words now have a ring of sadness and irrelevancy.  

To preach “unity” between Marxists and people who claim that a
“legal workers’ party is not a reactionary dream etc,, one has to be
either fantastically stupid, or else have no knowledge and no understanding
whatever of the Russian working-class movement and of the position in the
local organisations, or else one has to long for such a pleasant
“pendulum” state of affairs in which—who knows!—Trotsky (or some
other “non-factionalist”) will be invited to engineer non-factional”
unity “on an equal basis” between the group that contribute to Nasha
Zarya, Dyen and Kievskaya Mysl and the groups of
Marxist workers. What a sweet and delightful prospect!  

But real life, the real history of the attempts to “unite” with the
liquidators, reveals something very far removed from this sweet and
delightful prospect. There was a serious and concerted effort to unite with
the liquidators in January 1910, but it was wrecked by the
liquidators. There was unity of all groups and grouplets with the
liquidators against the hateful Conference of January 1912. This was

    

ardent and passionate unity based on the most passionate (and violently
abusive) invective against that Conference, with both Trotsky and the
Za Partiyu contributors and, of course, all the Vperyodists taking
part in this “union”. If the evil Leninist splitters were really an
obstacle to unity, then real unity would have blossomed forth immediately
after the joint statement against the Leninists, which these groups and the
liquidators published in Vorw\"arts in March 1912!  

But, alas, these queer unity-builders have since then—since the
workers in Russia, having inaugurated Pravda in April, proceeded
to unite the hundreds and thousands of workers’ groups in all parts of the
country on a basis of loyalty to the Party—these queer unity-builders
have, ever since March 1912, displayed ever greater disunity amongst
themselves! By August 1912 the famous “August bloc” of the liquidators
was formed without the Vperyodists and without
“Za Partiyu”.  

The next eighteen months saw the growth, maturity and ultimate
consolidation o-f the unity of workers’ groups in Russia, in all
legal working-class societies, in all the trade unions and organisations
and in a good many newspapers and organs, with the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma, which is prepared to carry out
the will of the majority of the workers.  

But what of our “unity-builders”?  

Oh, their “unity” efforts have been so felicitous and successful that
instead of one Vperyod group there are now two (not
counting Bogdanov, the empirio-monist whom some take for a third
Vperyod
group[12]); instead of a single Trotsky-and-liquidator paper
(Luch), there is now, in addition, Trotsky’s own organ,
Borba, which this time promises genuine “non-factionalism”. And
besides Trotsky’s timid withdrawal from the liquidator ranks, there has
been a complete and resolute withdrawal from them of all the organised
Lettish Marxists, who, despite their strict neutrality and
non-factionalism, forthrightly declared at their 1914 Congress: 

“The conciliators (participants in the August bloc)
have themselves fallen into ideological and political dependence on the
liquidators”!  
 

From March 1912, when everyone united with the liquida tots
against the evil “Leninist splitters”, up to March 1914, when the
fictitious “August bloc” finally fell to pieces, it became abundantly
clear that the real unity of the Marxist workers (in Russia, not in Paris
or Vienna) is proceeding, and will only proceed, in opposition to
the liquidationist group and regardless of the empty talk about
“unity” with the advocates of a “legal workers’ party”.  

Thousands of workers’ groups openly and publicly rallying around the
Marxist paper—here is living proof of genuine unity and its
development. Based on the principles evolved by the Marxists at the
beginning of the June Third period, this unity has enabled us—a
hundredfold more successfully than anyone else has done—to utilise every
legal opportunity, to utilise it in the spirit of a ruthless war
against the ideas that condemn the “boosting of the illegal press”, or
accept advocacy of “a legal party”, or renounce hegemony, or relegate to
the background the
“pillars”,[13] etc., etc.  

And only such unity, based on these principles, indicates the correct
path to the Russian working class.

The liquidationist historians present a ludicrous spectacle indeed when
they have to dodge and manoeuvre in order to disguise the
unpleasant but irrefutable fact that Menshevism (and liquidationism even
more so) emerged Thorn the very Economism, Bundism and “legal
Marxism” against which the old Iskra, builder of the
working-class party in Russia, fought for three years. See, for
instance, Mr. Potresov’s pamphlet on Axelrod. Mr. Potresov has tried just
as zealously and just as unsuccessfully to disguise and conceal
the fact that in his “Zemstvo campaign
plan”[14] Axelrod urged us not to frighten the liberals
away. Incidentally, even the Menshevik Plekhanov has fully admitted the
historical (in addition to theoretical) kinship between liquidationism, and
Economism and “legal Marxism”.  —Lenin

[6]
Otzovism (from the Russian word meaning “withdrawal”)—an
opportunist trend which arose among the Bolsheviks after the defeat of the
Revolution of 1905–07. The otzovists believed that under the prevailing
conditions of reaction the Party should conduct only illegal
activities. They demanded the withdrawal of the Social-Democratic deputies
from the Duma, and refused to take p art in the work of the trade unions
and other mass legal and semi-legal organisations. The otzovists’ policy
tended towards divorcing the Party from the masses and turning in into a
sectarian organisation.





[7]
Pochin (Initiative)—a journal of the
Narodnik-liquidationist trend run by a group of
Socialist-Revolutionaries. Only a single issue was published in June 1912
in Paris.




[14]
In the autumn of 1904 the editors of the Menshevik Iskra
published a letter stating that the chief task of the Social-Democrats was
to bring “organised pressure to bear on the bourgeois opposition” by
presenting demands to the government through the bourgeois liberals and
Zemstvo people. This “Zemstvo campaign plan” clearly revealed the
Mensheviks’ lack of faith In the proletariat’s strength, in its ability to
wage a political struggle and take independent revolutionary action. From
organisational opportunism the Mensheviks passed on to tactical
opportunism, the “Zemstvo campaign plan” being the first step in this
direction. A detailed analysis and criticism of the Mensheviks’ plan is
given by Lenin in “The Zemstvo Campaign and Iskra’s Plan”. (See
present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 497–518.)





[8]
The Bulygin Duma—a consultative Duma, the law for the
convocation of which was drafted by A. G. Bulygin, Minister of the Interior
on instructions from the tsar. The tsar’s Manifesto introducing the State
Duma and the regulations governing the elections to it was published on
August 6 (19), 1905. Only land lords, capitalists and a limited number of
peasant householders were granted the right to vote in the Duma
elections. The Bolsheviks boycotted the Bulygin Duma. The government failed
to convene it—it was swept away by the October general political strike.


The Witte Duma—the First Duma convened on April 27 (May 10),
1906, under the regulations drawn up by S. Y. Witte, Chairman of the
Council of Ministers.  

Four hundred and seventy-eight deputies were elected to the First Duma,
of whom 179 were Cadets, 63 Autonomists (including members of the Polish
kolo, and Ukrainian, Estonian, Lettish,

   

Lithuanian and other bourgeois-national groups), 16 Octobrists,
105 non-party people, 97 Trudoviks and 18 Social-Democrats. Thus, over a
third of the seats in the Duma were held by the Cadets.  

The high point of the First Duma deliberations was the agrarian
question. Two basic agrarian programmes were put forward in the Duma—the
Cadets’ Bill signed by 42 deputies, and the Trudoviks’ Bill known as the
“Bill of the 104”. In contrast with the Trudoviks, the Cadets wanted to
preserve landlordism, allowing alienation with compensation “at a fair
price” of only those landed estates which were chiefly cultivated by the
peasants’ implements or were rented out.  

The First Duma was dissolved by the tsarist government on July 8 (21),
1906.





[9]
Tovarishch (Comrade)—a bourgeois daily published in
St. Petersburg from March 15 (28), 1906 to December 30, 1907 (January 12,
1908). Though formally the organ of no particular party, it was in fact the
mouthpiece of the Left Cadets. Mensheviks also contributed to the paper.





[10]
Za Partiyu (For the Party)—a paper of the pro-Party
Mensheviks and conciliators published non-periodically in Paris from
April 16 (29), 1912, to February 1914. Five issues were published. Among
the contributors were G.V. Plekhanov, S.A. Lozovsky, and A.I. Lyubimov. The
paper, which was circulated chiefly abroad, expressed the views, in the
main, of the Paris group of Plekhanovites.





[11]
Buryanov, A. F.—member of the Fourth Duma, and one of the
Menshevik Seven.





[12]
Vperyod groups—see Lenin’s article “The Vperyodists and the
Vperyod group”. (See pp. 487–93 of this volume.)

A good deal has already been said in the newspapers about
the famous Duma session of April 22 at Which all the Social-Democrats and
Trudoviks were
ejected.[1] However, the full implications of this event have not yet
been sufficiently explained.  

Every political crisis, whatever its outcome, is useful in that it
brings to light things that have been hidden, reveals the forces operating
in politics, exposes deception and self-deception, catch-phrases and
fictions, and affords striking demonstration of “things as they
are”, by forcibly driving them home.  

All the democratic members of the Duma, both Social-Democrats and
Trudoviks, were suspended for fifteen sessions and ejected, most of them by
armed force. This was done in deference to those who, by taking measures
against Chkheidze, clearly revealed their “firm” intention of taking a
step (or rather, a dozen steps at once) towards the right. The Rights and
Octobrists, plus some of the Progressists, i.e., the bourgeois
liberals, who are in close, in fact, inseparable league with the Cadets,
voted for this ejection.  

The Cadets abstained! This abstention by a party which claims to be
democratic admirably revealed—by no means for the first time—the true
nature of the Cadet gentry’s liberalism. The Fourth Duma prepares to expel
Chkheidze, then the other Social-Democrats, and then all the democrats, and
starts by suspending them, yet the “leaders” of the liberal opposition
abstain front voting! No matter how many gallons of ink the
liberals and Cadets may afterwards use up to invent sophisms and evasions
such as: we merely disapproved of the “form” of the Social-Democrats’
speeches,

    

etc.—the crux of the matter will remain clear to anybody who does not
wish to deceive himself.  

Abstaining from voting when Goremykin, Rodzyanko and their majority
expelled the democratic deputies actually implied tacit support, moral
approval and political endorsement of Goremykin and Rodzyanko and their
majority.  

One cannot agree with the point of view expressed by L. M. in
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta, No. 61, who wrote that the “Duma
majority headed by the Octobrists have committed political suicide”. That
is the point of view of a Left liberal, not of a democrat, and certainly
not of a Social-Democrat.  

The Duma majority and the Octobrists have not committed suicide at
all. All of them are deliberate counter-revolutionaries, deliberate
participants in the June Third bloc and in the Stolypin system, deliberate
enemies of democracy. Since they recognise Goremykin as their political
leader, why is it suicide for them to follow this leader against their
class enemies, against the representatives of democracy, who are
notoriously hostile to the Octobrists?  

What is the purpose of these turgid and utterly false phrases about
“suicide”? Such phrases assume that the Octobrists are
not the enemies of democracy, i. e., assume something that is
disgustingly false. These phrases resemble the vulgar democratism of those
misguided Left Narodniks who often shouted that the Third and the Fourth
Duma were a “pasteboard” institution, a house of cards. The Octobrists’
vote for Goremykin, Maklakov and Shcheglovitov could have been considered
suicidal only if the Octobrists had expressed the “will of the
people”. Actually, however, they express the “will” of those
sections of the big bourgeoisie and the landlords which stand in mortal
fear of the people.  

No, let us face the truth squarely. In politics that is always the best
and the only correct attitude.  

And the truth is that the Duma events of April 22 shattered and killed
the remnants of constitutional and legalistic illusions. The
counter-revolutionary bloc of Purishkevich, Rodzyanko and the “Left”
Octobrists, plus a section of the Progressists, came out against democracy
bluntly,

    

openly, determinedly, in soldier fashion (not in the metaphorical,
but in the literal sense of this last term, for soldiers were called into
the Duma). The counter-revolutionary liberals, Milyukov and Co.,
abstained from voting. This could only have been expected after
all that has happened in the Third and the Fourth Duma, after all that
happened in the first decade of the twentieth century.  

Well, the less self-deception there is, the better for the people. What
has the country gained from the Duma events of April 22? It has gained by
losing another particle of illusions that are detrimental to the cause of
freedom in this country.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
At the session of the Duma on April 22 (May 5), 1914, the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group (the Bolshevik Six), the Social-Democratic
group (the Mensheviks) and the Trudoviks moved that the budget debates
should be adjourned pending the adoption of the Bill on the freedom of
speech for deputies.  

This motion was defeated by a majority of the Duma. Thereupon the
Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Trudoviks used obstructionist tactics during the
speech of Goremykin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Rodzyanko,
Chairman of the Duma, retorted by suspending all the Social-Democrats and
the Trudoviks from the Duma for fifteen sessions. In reply St. Petersburg
and Moscow workers held strikes of protest.

The profound ideological change that has taken place among
the opposition, or progressive, sections of the people is an
extremely important and distinctive feature of post-revolutionary
Russia. To forget this distinctive feature is to prevent oneself from
understanding the Russian revolution and its character, as well as the
tasks of the working class in our time.  

The ideological change among the liberal bourgeoisie is expressed in
the rise of an anti-democratic trend (Struve, Izgoyev and V. Maklakov
openly, the rest of the Cadets secretly, “bashfully”).  

Among the democrats this change is expressed in the utter ideological
confusion and vacillation that prevail among both the Social-Democrats
(proletarian democrats) and the Socialist-Revolutionaries (bourgeois
democrats). Even the best representatives of democracy confine themselves
to bewailing this confusion, vacillation and back sliding. The
Marxists, however, look for the class roots of this
social phenomenon.  

The chief symptom of this break-down is liquidationism, which as far
back as 1908 was officially defined as “an attempt by a certain part of
the intelligentsia to liquidate” the “underground”, and to
“substitute” for it a legal workers’ party, a definition that was
endorsed by “the entire Marxist
body”.[2] At the last official meeting of leading Marxists held in
January 1910, which was attended by representatives of all
“trends” and groups, there was not a single person who protested
against the condemnation of liquidationism as a manifestation of
bourgeois influence on the proletariat. This condemnation, which was
also an

    

explanation of the class roots of liquidationism, was adopted
unanimously.  

Over four years have passed since then, and the vast experience of the
mass working-class movement has provided a thousand proofs that this
appraisal of liquidationism is correct.  

The facts have shown that, between them, the theory of Marxism and the
practical experience of the mass working-class movement have killed
liquidationism, which is a bourgeois and anti-workers’ trend. It is
sufficient to recall how, in a single month, March 1914, Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta vilified the “illegal press” (issue of March 13),
and demonstrations (Mr. Gorsky in the issue of April 11), and how Bulkin,
in perfect imitation of the liberals, vilified the “underground”
(Nasha Zarya No. 3), how the notorious L. M., on behalf
of the editors of Nasha Zarya, fully supported Bulkin on this
point and argued the case for “building a legal workers’ party”—it is
sufficient to recall all this to understand why the attitude of the
class-conscious workers towards liquidationism cannot be anything
else than that of ruthless condemnation and complete boycott of the
liquidators.  

But here a very important question crops up: How did this trend arise
historically?  

It arose in the course of the twenty years’ history of
Marxism’s ties with the mass working-class movement in Russia. Up to
1894–95 there were no such ties. The Emancipation of Labour group only
laid the theoretical foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and
took the first step towards the working-class movement.  

It was only the propaganda of 1894–95 and the strikes of 1895–96 that
established firm and inseverable ties between Social-Democracy and the mass
working-class movement. And immediately an ideological struggle
commenced between the two trends of Marxism: the struggle between the
Economists and the consistent Marxists or (later) Iskrists (1895–1902),
the struggle between the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks (1903–08), and the
struggle between the liquidators and the Marxists (1908–14).  

Economism and liquidationism are two different forms of the same
petty-bourgeois, intellectualist opportunism that

    

has existed for twenty years. That there is a personal as well as
ideological connection between all these forms of opportunism is an
undoubted fact. It is sufficient to mention the name of the leader of the
Economists, A. Martynov, who subsequently became a Menshevik and is now a
liquidator. It is sufficient to call a witness like G. V. Plekhanov, who,
on very many
       points,[1]

stood close to the Mensheviks, but nevertheless openly admitted that the
Mensheviks absorbed intellectualist opportunist elements into their ranks,
and that the liquidators continued the errors of Economism and were
disrupters of the workers’ party.  

People who (like the liquidators and Trotsky) ignore or falsify this
twenty years’ history of the ideological struggle in the working-class
movement do tremendous harm to the workers.  

A worker who takes an anythingarian attitude towards the history of his
own movement cannot be considered class-conscious. Of all the capitalist
countries, Russia is one of the most backward and most petty
bourgeois. That is why the mass working-class movement gave rise
to a petty-bourgeois, opportunist wing in that movement, not by
chance, but inevitably.  

The progress made during these twenty years in ridding the
working-class movement of the influence of the bourgeoisie, of the
influence of Economism and of liquidationism, has been
tremendous. For the first time, a real, proletarian foundation for
a real Marxist party is being securely laid. It is generally admitted, even
the opponents of the Pravdists

    

are compelled to admit—the facts compel them to admit it!—that among
class-conscious workers the Pravdists constitute the overwhelming
majority. What the Marxist “plenum” of January 1910 recognised
theoretically (that liquidationism is “bourgeois influence on the
proletariat”), the class-conscious workers have been putting into practice
during the past four years; they have secured practical recognition of it
by weakening the liquidators, by removing them from office, by reducing
liquidationism to a group of legal, opportunist publicists standing outside
the mass working-class movement.  

During this twenty-year-old conflict of ideas the working-class
movement in Russia has been growing in scope and strength and steadily
maturing. It has defeated Economism; the flower of the class-conscious
proletariat have sided with the Iskrists. At every decisive stage in the
revolution they have left the Mensheviks in the minority: even
Levitsky himself has had to admit that the masses of the workers
sided with the Bolsheviks.  

And, finally, it has now defeated liquidationism and, as a result, has
taken the correct road of the broad struggle—illumined by Marxist theory
and summed up in uncurtailed slogans—of the advanced class for the
advanced historical aims of mankind.  

 
Notes
 

[1]
Why do we say “on very many points”? Because Plekhanov occupied a
special position, and departed from Menshevism many
times:
(1) at the 1903 Congress Plekhanov fought the opportunism of the
Mensheviks;
(2) after the Congress Plekhanov edited Nos. 46–51 of Iskra, also
in opposition to the Mensheviks;
(3) in 1904 Plekhanov defended Axelrod’s plan for a Zemstvo campaign in
such a way that he passed over its chief mistakes in silence;
(4) in the spring of 1905 Plekhanov left the Mensheviks;
(5) in 1906, after the dissolution of the First Duma, the stand Plekhanov
took was not at all a Menshevik one (see
Proletary,[3] August 1906); (present edition, Vol. 11,
pp. 179–83.—Ed.);
(6) at the London Congress in 1907—as Cherevanin relates—Plekhanov
opposed the “organisational anarchism” of the Mensheviks. One must know
these facts in order to understand why the Menshevik Plekhanov so long and
so resolutely fought liquidationism and denounced it.  —Lenin
 



[2]
This refers to the Fifth Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (the All-Russia
Conference 1908). (See Note 52.)





[3]
Proletary (The Proletarian)—a Bolshevik illegal
newspaper, published from August 21 (September 3), 1906 to November 28
(December 11), 1909 under the editorship of Lenin. Fifty issues were
published. Active collaborators on the paper were M. F. Vladimirsky,
V. V. Vorovsky, I. F. Dubrovinsky, A. V. Lunacharsky and others. The first
twenty issues were prepared for the press and set up in Vyborg, but as
conditions for the publication of an illegal organ in Russia became
extremely difficult, further publication was transferred abroad (Geneva and
Paris).  

Proletary was virtually the Central Organ of the
Bolsheviks. Most of the work on the paper was done by Lenin, several of
whose articles appeared in a most every issue. Proletary published
over a hundred articles and paragraphs by Lenin an the most important
issues of the revolutionary struggle of the working class. The paper dealt
with tactical and political questions of general interest and carried
reports on the activities of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., the
decisions of conferences and plenary meetings of the C.C., letters of the
C.C. on various questions of Party activities, and a number of other
documents. A supplement to No. 46 of the newspaper published a report on
the conference of the extended Editorial Board of Proletary, as
well as the resolutions of that meeting, which was held in Paris on June
8--17 (21–30), 1909. The newspaper was in close touch with the local Party
organisations.  

During the years of the Stolypin reaction Proletary played an
outstanding role in safeguarding and strengthening the Bolshevik
organisations, in fighting the liquidators, otzovists, ultimatumists and
god-builders.  

Publication of the newspaper ceased in 1910 in accordance with the
decision of the January Plenum of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P.

1.
The boundaries of Russia’s administrative divisions, rural and urban
(villages, volosts, uyezds, gubernias, parts and sections of towns,
suburbs, etc.), shall be re vised on the basis of a register of present-day
economic conditions and the national composition of the population.  

2.
This register shall be made by commissions elected by the local population
on the basis of universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot with
proportional representation; national minorities too small (under
proportional representation) to elect one commission member shall elect a
commission member with a consultative voice.  

3.
The new boundaries shall be endorsed by the central parliament of the
country.  

4.
Local self-government shall be introduced in all areas of the country
without exception, on the basis of universal, direct and equal suffrage by
secret ballot with proportional representation; areas with specific
geographical, living or economic conditions or a special national
composition of the population shall have the right to form autonomous
regions with autonomous regional Diets.  

5.
The limits of jurisdiction exercised by the autonomous Diets and local
self-governing bodies shall be determined by the central parliament of the
country.  

6.
All nations in the state are absolutely equal, and all privileges enjoyed
by any one nation or any one language are held to be inadmissible and
anti-constitutional.  
 

7.
The local self-governing bodies and autonomous Diets shall determine the
language in which business is to be conducted by state and public
establishments in a given area or region, all national minorities having
the right to demand absolute safeguards for their language on the basis of
the principle of equality, for example, the right to receive replies from
state and public establishments in the language in which they are
addressed, etc. Measures by Zemstvos, towns, etc., which infringe the
equality of languages enjoyed by the national minorities in financial,
administrative, legal and all other fields, shall be considered non-valid
and subject to repeal on a protest filed by any citizen of the state,
regardless of domicile.  

8.
Each self-governing unit of the state, rural and urban, shall elect, on the
basis of universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot with
proportional representation, boards of education to take care, wholly and
autonomously, of expenditures on all the cultural and educational needs of
the population subject to the control and management of the town and
Zemstvo bodies.  

9.
In territorial units with a mixed population the number of members on the
boards of education shall not be less than twenty. This number (20) may be
increased by order of the self-governing bodies and autonomous Diets. Areas
shall be considered as having a mixed population where a national minority
constitutes up to five per cent of the population.  

10.
Every national minority of a given self-governing unit that is too small to
elect, under proportional representation, one member of the board of
education shall be entitled to elect a member with a consultative voice.


11.
The proportional share of the funds expended on the cultural and
educational needs of the national minorities in a given area shall not be
less than the proportional share of the national minorities in the whole
population of the given area.  

12.
A census of the population, with due account of the native language of
citizens, shall be carried out every ten years throughout the state, and
every five years in regions and areas with a mixed population.  
 

13.
All measures by boards of education which in any way infringe the complete
equality of nations and languages of the local population or the
proportionality of expenditures on cultural and educational needs in
conformity with the share of the national minorities in the population,
shall be considered non-valid and subject to repeal on a protest of any
citizen of the state, regardless of domicile.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Bill on the Equality of Nations and the Safeguarding of the Rights
of National Minorities was drafted by Lenin for introduction to the
Fourth Duma by the Bolshevik group.  

The plan of the Bill was outlined in a letter to S. 0. Shahumyan, dated
May 6 (19), 1914, from Lenin who attached special importance to the
introduction of this Bill in the Duma. “In this way”, he wrote, “I
believe we can popularly explain the stupidity of cultural-national
autonomy and crush the votaries of this folly once for all.”


The Bill was not introduced.

There are certain winged words which most aptly express
rather complex phenomena. Among these should undoubtedly be included the
statement made by a certain landlord, member of the Right majority in the
Duma, in connection with Goremykin’s speech during the historic session of
April 22.  

“How nice it would be to have squire Goremykin for a
neighbour!”  

These words, uttered on the day the workers’ and peasants’ deputies
were ejected from the Duma, are a very useful reminder now that these
deputies have resumed their seats. These words admirably describe the force
which the democrats have to contend with within the Duma and outside it.


The petty squire who uttered these winged words spoke them in jest but
he unwittingly voiced a truth that was more serious and profound than he
had intended. Indeed, take the whole of this Fourth Duma, the whole of this
majority of Rights and Octobrists, and all the “bigwigs” in the Council
of State—what are they all if not “neighbouring squires”?  

In Russia 194 privy councillors own 3,103,579 dessiatines of land, an
average of over 20,000 dessiatines per privy councillor. And all the big
landowners in Russia, numbering less than 30,000, own 70,000,000
dessiatines of land. It is this class that forms the majority in the Duma,
in the Council of State and among high government officials, to say nothing
of the Zemstvo and local administrations. They are all “neighbouring
squires”.  

In our capitalist age these “neighbouring squires” are increasingly
becoming factory owners, distillers, sugar manufacturers, and so forth;
they are increasingly becoming shareholders in all kinds of commercial,
industrial, financial,

    

and railway undertakings. The highest nobility are becoming closely
interwoven with the big bourgeoisie.  

These “neighbouring squires” are the best class organisation
in Russia, for they are organised, not only as neighbours, not only in
associations, but also as a state force. They occupy all the most important
institutions in the land, which are fashioned “in their own image”, to
suit their own “needs” and interests. True, our state system has very
important features of its own, attributable to the military history of
Russia, and so forth, features which may sometimes displease even the class
of the landed gentry. Nevertheless, by and large, the Great-Russian landed
gentry set a splendid pattern of class organisation!  

Our bourgeoisie make little use of this pattern. They dare not think,
for example, of organising their own class into a state power. But
the proletariat, organising as a class, has never forgotten and never will
forget the splendid pattern set by the “neighbouring squires”....

The more the working-class movement develops and the
greater unity it shows in action, the louder do the intellectualist
grouplets, who are isolated from the masses, shout about “factionalism”,
“Pravdist contagion”, “factional blindness”, and so forth. These people
little suspect that in doing so they are issuing themselves with a
testimonium paupertatis. What they take for a sort of natural
calamity, which can only be loudly bewailed, is really a sign of the
maturity and consistency of our working-class movement.  

Nothing has exposed the gross falsity of these intellectualist outcries
against the workers’ “factionalism” so much as the recent open elections
of the workers’ insurance representatives.  

Take the Narodnik newspaper Mysl
Truda.[1] After all the insurance elections in
St. Petersburg are over, we read in the issue of that paper for April 20 a
ranting article which, with a serious air, argues that on no account must
there be any “yielding to the factional coercion [!] of the Pravdists”.


Factional coercion! What presumption on the part of this Narodnik paper
to make such a demagogic statement!  

Just think, reader. Open elections by the workers take place. The
workers hold an opinion poll among themselves as to the political trends of
the participants. The following unchallenged figures of the political
composition of the electors are published for general information:
Pravdists 37, liquidators 7, Narodniks 4, and unspecified 5. The workers,
naturally, elect a majority of Pravdists. (The minority, too, was
represented—the Mensheviks, not the liquidators.) And after this the
Narodnik newspaper makes an uproar about “factional coercion 
 

You are simply making yourselves look ridiculous, Narodnik
gentlemen. What you have done is to clearly demonstrate how utterly
meaningless that threadbare cliché
“factionalism” is. You have overlooked two simple figures—37 and
4. Only 4 out of 53 worker electors were Narodniks, that is, a mere 7
per cent. Apparently, the Narodniks think the workers ought to elect their
representatives not by a majority vote, but by a minority. To
please the Narodniks, 37 worker electors should have been equated with
4. Thirty-seven equals four—that, strictly speaking, is what the good
“non-factional” Narodniks are trying to din into the workers. No wonder
the workers cannot make head or tail of this profound Narodnik wisdom.


There is a limit to everything, “non-factional” Narodniks. By
shouting about the “factional coercion”, of the majority when you have 4
electors out of 53 you are only proving one thing, namely, that you do not
respect the will of the majority, that in raving against “factionalism”
you are trying to thwart the will of the vast majority of the
workers. You, and you alone, are actually trying to practice coercion
of the overwhelming majority by an insignificant minority.  

By pursuing the paltry and unprincipled policy of a coterie that is
isolated from the masses, you, with your ranting against “factional
coercion”, are trying to act upon the workers’ nerves and to
extort from them, by this unbecoming trick, satisfaction of your
parochial interests. If there is any “factionalism” of the worst possible
kind, it is exemplified in the behaviour of the liquidator and Narodnik
circles, who are trying to thwart the will of the workers.  

We see the same picture in connection with the insurance elections in
so big a centre as Riga.  

A meeting of the sick benefit societies is held to nominate candidates
for the Gubernia Insurance Board. Twenty-one sick benefit societies are
represented. There is a sharp struggle of political trends. On one
side—the liquidators, Narodniks, non-party people and several trade
unions. On the other—the Pravdists. Lots of speakers from both sides take
the floor. In the end the Pravdist list of candidates receives 44 votes,
while the bloc of all the others receives 20. (These figures are from the
same source—Mysl
    

Truda No. 2.) The Pravdists thus have a majority of over
two-thirds.  

After this the Narodniks again start their plaint about
“factionalism” and “factional coercion”.  

Notice the word-juggling. The Narodniks, as we know, have never been a
section of Social-Democracy. The Narodniks and the
Social-Democrats have always been two separate parties,
with programmes, tactics and organisations of their own. The struggle
between the Social-Democrats and the Narodniks is a struggle between
political parties, not a struggle between sections of a
party. “Factionalism” has nothing to do with it.  

It is clear enough that in vociferating against “factionalism” the
liquidators and “conciliators” are merely playing into the hands of the
enemies of the workers’ party, are merely sowing chaos and
disunity, are confusing terms, and bamboozling the workers.  

The outcry against “factionalism” has become a system. The enemies of
the Marxists are deliberately using it to bamboozle the workers. When some
decision adopted by the workers is not to the liking of some intellectual
or group of intellectuals, the outcry is raised, “Help! ‘Factionalism’!
Help! ‘Factional coercion’!”  

You will astonish nobody with that sort of thing, gentlemen. When the
splitter and liberal, F. D., in Severnaya Likvidatorskaya
Gazeta[2] calls God to witness in every other line that he is for
“unity”; when Trotsky in his super-intellectual highbrow mouthpiece rants
about “factional emancipation”; when the petty-bourgeois quasi-socialists
of Mysl Truda asseverate that they stand for unity, the workers
tell them: whoever stands for true unity of the working-class movement must
submit to the majority of the class-conscious workers and not dare oppose
the Marxist programme and Marxist tactics.

The more strongly the working-class movement develops the
more frantic are the attempts by the bourgeoisie and the feudalists to
suppress it or break it up. Both these methods—suppression by force and
disintegration by bourgeois influence—are constantly employed all over
the world, in all countries, and one or another of these methods is adopted
alternately by the different parties of the ruling classes.  

In Russia, particularly after 1905, when the more intelligent members
of the bourgeoisie realised that brute force alone was ineffective, all
sorts of “progressive” bourgeois parties and groups have been more and
more often resorting to the method of dividing the workers by
advocating different bourgeois ideas and doctrines designed to weaken the
struggle of the working class.  

One such idea is refined nationalism, which advocates the division and
splitting up of the proletariat on the most plausible and specious
pretexts, as for example, that of protecting the interests of “national
culture”, “national autonomy, or independence”, and so on, and so forth.


The class-conscious workers fight hard against every kind of
nationalism, both the crude, violent, Black-Hundred nationalism, and that
most refined nationalism which preaches the equality of nations
together with ... the splitting up of the workers’ cause,
the workers’ organisations and the working-class movement according
to nationality. Unlike all the varieties of the nationalist
bourgeoisie, the class conscious workers, carrying out the decisions of the
recent (summer 1913) conference of the Marxists, stand, not only for the
most complete, consistent and fully applied equality
    

of nations and languages, but also for the amalgamation of the
workers of the different nationalities in united proletarian
organisations of every kind.  

Herein lies the fundamental distinction between the national programme
of Marxism and that of any bourgeoisie, be it the most “advanced”.  

Recognition of the equality of nations and languages is important to
Marxists, not only because they are the most consistent democrats. The
interests of proletarian solidarity and comradely unity in the workers’
class struggle call for the fullest equality of nations with a view to
removing every trace of national distrust, estrangement, suspicion and
enmity. And full equality implies the repudiation of all privileges for any
one language and the recognition of the right of
self-determination for all nations.  

To the bourgeoisie, however, the demand for national equality very
often amounts in practice to advocating national exclusiveness and
chauvinism; they very often couple it with advocacy of the
division and estrangement of nations. This is absolutely
incompatible with proletarian internationalism, which advocates,
not only closer relations between nations, but the
amalgamation of the workers of all nationalities in a given state
in united proletarian organisations. That is why Marxists
emphatically condemn so-called “cultural-national autonomy”, i. e., the
idea that educational affairs should be taken out of the hands of
the state and transferred to the respective nationalities. This
plan means that in questions of “national culture” educational affairs
are to be split up in national associations according to the
nationalities in the given state federation, each with its own
separate Diet, educational budgets, school boards, and educational
institutions.  

This is a plan of refined nationalism, which corrupts and divides the
working class. To this plan (of the Bundists, liquidators and Narodniks,
i. e., of the various petty-bourgeois groups), the Marxists contrapose the
principle of complete equality of nations and languages and go to the
extent of denying the necessity of an official language; at the same time
they advocate the closest possible relations between the nations, uniform
state institutions for all nations, uniform school boards, a
uniform education policy

    

(secular education!) and the unity of the workers of the different nations
in the struggle against the nationalism of every national
bourgeoisie, a nationalism which is presented in the form of the
slogan “national culture” for the purpose of deceiving simpletons.  

Let the petty-bourgeois nationalists—the Bundists, the liquidators,
the Narodniks and the writers for Dzvin—openly advocate their principle
of refined bourgeois nationalism; that is their right. But they should not
try to fool the workers, as Madam
V. 0.[1] does, for example, in issue No. 35 of Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta, where she assures her readers that Za Pravdu is
opposed to instruction in schools being given in the native
languages!  

That is gross slander. The Pravdists not only recognise this right, but
are more consistent in recognising it than anyone else. The
Pravdists, who identified themselves with the conference of Marxists, which
declared that no compulsory official language was necessary, were
the first in Russia to recognise fully the right to use
the native language!  

It is crass ignorance to confuse instruction in the native language
with “dividing educational affairs within a single state according to
nationality”, with “cultural-national autonomy”, with “taking
educational affairs out of the hands of the state”.  

Nowhere in the world are Marxists (or even democrats) opposed to
instruction being conducted in the native language. And nowhere in the
world have Marxists adopted the programme of “cultural-national
autonomy”; Austria is the only country in which it was
proposed.  

The example of Finland, as quoted by Madam V. 0., is an argument
against herself, for in that country the equality of nations and
languages (which we recognise unreservedly and more consistently than
anybody) is recognised and carried out, but there is no question there
about taking educational affairs out of the hands of the state, about
separate national associations to deal with all educational affairs, about
partitioning up the school system of a country with national barriers, and
so forth.

The present political situation in Russia is marked by the
growth of the strike movement in general, as well as by an increase in the
number of political strikes (for example, May 1st strikes), and by the
growth of the Pravdist trend among the workers (the Insurance Board
elections in the two capitals, and the election of the All-Russia Insurance
Board provided additional proof, of this).  

The connection between the nature of the working-class movement and the
trend which the overwhelming majority of class-conscious workers have
recognised as their own is obvious and requires no special
explanation.  

Another feature of the present political situation is the fact that a
“Left bloc” is taking exceptionally clear and distinct shape, i.e., the
emergence of joint action by proletarian and bourgeois democrats (Trudoviks
and liquidators) against both the Purishkeviches and treacherous bourgeois
liberalism. The obstruction organised by the Left in the Duma, and the
suspension of the Social-Democrats and Trudoviks by the votes of the
Rights, the Octobrists and a section of the Progressists, with the Cadets
abstaining from voting, have clearly shown what this “Left bloc”
is. Proletarian democrats have not weakened their independence by a jot,
nor have they retreated from their proletarian, Pravdist line. The only
ones to support this line against the liberals have been the Trudoviks and
liquidators, although they both often waver and incline towards the
liberals.  

Lastly, the present political situation is marked by vacillation and
discontent among the bourgeois classes. This was expressed in the speeches
and resolutions of the Commercial and Industrial Congress. They revealed
obvious discontent

    

with the government, and an obvious mood of opposition.  

This also found expression in the anti-Cabinet motion adopted in the
Duma by the Octobrists—the Zemstvo people and the liberals—during the
debate on the estimates of the Ministry of the Interior. Jubilant at the
Octobrists having adopted “their” point of view, the Cadets forget to add
that they themselves had adopted the Octobrist point of view!


The resolution adopted by the Fourth Duma expresses a quite definite
counter-revolutionary and imperialist point of view. In this resolution the
government’s policy is condemned because 


   “administrative tyranny all over the country is causing
   discontent and unrest among large, tranquil [i. e., bourgeois reactionary
   and landlord] sections of the population, and is thereby stimulating the
   rise and growth of anti-government tendencies”.  


The Octobrists are referring to democracy. The Cadets have again and
again publicly renounced democracy. So much the better, for they never have
been, and never can be, democrats; they merely deceived democracy when they
undertook to represent it. Democracy in Russia cannot take a single step
forward unless it sees through the bourgeois liberal frauds perpetrated by
the Cadets.  

To sum up.  

Continued growth of the working-class movement. Greater unity between
the majority of the workers and Pravdism.  

Definite emergence of a “Left bloc”, expressed in joint action by
proletarian and bourgeois democrats (Trudoviks and liquidators) against the
Rights and against the Cadets.  

Disintegration, vacillation, mutual distrust and discontent within the
Third of June system, among the land lords and reactionary
bourgeoisie. “They” accuse one another—the Purishkeviches accuse the
liberals, and the liberals the Purishkeviches—of encouraging and
accelerating the new revolution.  

Such is the situation.

In the course of their movement’s progress, the
class-conscious workers constantly look back on the road this movement has
travelled and constantly consider whether it is the right one, and whether
it can possibly be improved.  

Of all the classes in Russia, not a single one, not even the educated
and wealthy bourgeoisie, discusses its tactics, that is, the direction and
the methods of its movement, so outspokenly, clearly, and as far as
possible openly as the working class does. Only people who are
shallow-minded or who fear the participation of the broad masses in
politics can think that the open and heated controversies over tactics that
are constantly to be seen in the working-class press are inappropriate or
unnecessary. As a matter of fact, it is these heated controversies that
help and teach all the workers to discuss their own, labour, policy from
every angle, and to evolve a firm, distinct and definite class line for the
movement.  

The workers employed at the Stationery Office recently gave a very
convincing demonstration of what the attitude of the class-conscious
workers is, and should be, towards controversies over tactics.  

In Put Pravdy No. 68, they wrote: “We wish to point out to
comrades in the Stationery Office who responded to the call of the
supporters of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta, and made equal
collections for both newspapers in the belief that this was a step towards
unity, that we consider this step wrong, one that will not lead to the
unity of the working-class movement, but, on the contrary, will put off

    

the day when the workers will unite under the single banner of Marxism. Let
us take the following example. Let us assume that two men are arguing
heatedly over a question that concerns us, that this argument annoys us,
and we want to put a stop to it. What should we do under the circumstances?
Clearly, we should ascertain which of the two is in the right and take his
side; the one who is wrong will then see that he is mistaken, or, if he
does not see his mistake, will peter out and stop arguing. But if we
support and encourage both disputants, the argument will never cease.”


This is what the workers of the Stationery Office wrote. Their simple
explanation, which every worker understands, is unassailable.  

“Equal” assistance or the desire to merge, or “unite, all
trends” (which, incidentally, is what Duma sympathisers with
liquidationism are saying) actually amounts to a desire to order the
workers about from outside in the belief that the workers themselves are
unable to “grasp these things”. Any little group of intellectuals can
publish a pamphlet or a paltry journal, and proclaim themselves a
“trend”, as, for example, the group of the anti-Marxist philosopher
Bogdanov, or Trotsky’s group, or N. N. Himmer’s, which vacillates between
the Narodniks and the Marxists, and so forth.  

There are any number of “trends”, and the workers are told: help them
all “equally”, recognise “all trends”!  

Naturally, any worker who is at all class-conscious will ask: What is
the argument about? About my struggle? About my policy
and tactics? About my Party?  

If so, then I will work it all out for myself, gentlemen, and I will
proclaim as my own only those tactics I approve of and agree with.


This is as clear as daylight.  

It is only because there is no free press in Russia and because there
are still lots of workers (especially in the provinces) who have seen one
or another working-class newspaper for the first time and are as yet quite
“unable to grasp” the problems of working-class policy—it is only
because of this that it is possible in Russia for the intellectuals to try
to run the workers by appealing

    

to them to recognise “all trends” and to assist them “equally”.  

In the market-place it often happens that the vendor who shouts loudest
and calls God to witness is the one with the shoddiest goods for sale.


In the market-place of intellectualist fuss and bustle it often happens
that those who shout loudest against running the workers are the very
intellectuals who try to do so and proclaim the formation of a countless
number of anti-Marxist and anti-proletarian “trends”.  

Take St. Petersburg. No man in his right mind can deny that, compared
with the provinces, the workers in St. Petersburg are more cultured and
intelligent, more accustomed to and capable of independently “grasping”
all questions connected with the theory of Marxism and the practice of the
working-class movement.  

What do we find there?  

The St. Petersburg workers did grasp the question, and
recognised the Pravdist trend as the right one.  

The overwhelming majority of the workers in St. Petersburg declared in
favour of Pravdism and proved by action that they recognise only
this “trend” as their own.  

In the provinces the Pravdists preponderate to a lesser extent, but
even so they still do preponderate. This has been proved during the last
two years by the facts about the workers’ groups, facts which are
“unpalatable” to the opponents of Pravdism, but which remain facts for
all that.  

The majority of class-conscious workers discussed the question, weighed
the arguments for and against the various tactics, and recognised the
Pravdist tactics as their own. Attempts to thwart and to disrupt
the unity and will of this majority of workers are now being made by the
founders of the intellectualist “trends” of liquidationism, Trotskyism
(Borba), the mixture of Narodism and Marxism (Mr. Himmer’s
Sovremennik[1]), and others.  

We are convinced that all these intellectualist “trends”, preaching
anti-Marxist ideas or urging concessions to them, will fall to the ground
upon impact with the class-consciousness and the will of the advanced
Marxist workers, The example of St. Petersburg confirms our conviction.

 

It is highly amusing to hear the intellectualist founders of groups and
“trends” that are trying to disrupt the unity of the workers vociferating
about “unity”. They are against unity of the workers, which has been
achieved in fact, and are for unity of the intellectualist trends, which is
promised in word.

The Left Narodniks in Stoikaya Mysl No. 20, and
the Narodniks in Russkoye Bogatstvo No. 4, have attacked the
Narodnik Russkiye Vedomosti for having declared in favour of the
freedom of mobilisation, i.e., the purchase, sale, and mortgaging of
allotment land.  

This question is interesting because it strikingly confirms the Marxist
appraisal of the extremely backward and reactionary character of Narodnik
theory. The practical significance of this question is another reason for
us to deal with it.  

In a society in which commodity production prevails, every small farmer
is inevitably and increasingly drawn into the sphere of exchange
and becomes increasingly dependent on the market, not only the
local and national, but the world market as well. Each day of
economic progress throughout the world, each mile of new railway laid, each
new rural worker who migrates to the town or goes to work in a factory in
search of “earnings”, each new agricultural machine that is introduced,
in short, literally each step in world economic life draws the most remote
localities into the sphere of exchange. Millions and millions of phenomena
observed day by day prove that production for exchange, commodity
production, capitalism, are growing in all parts of the world, and all
countries without exception. That production for exchange and simple
commodity production are evolving into capitalism is another phenomenon con
firmed by millions and millions of daily economic observations in every
village, in every trade, and in every handicraft.  

Clearly, every peasant who finds himself in this milieu of
world economy is a commodity producer and with every

    

day becomes more and more dependent on the market, selling his products,
buying implements of production and articles of consumption, hiring
labourers, or hiring himself out as a labourer. Under these circumstances;
since land is private property, freedom to buy, sell and mortgage land is
an essential condition for the development of capitalism. Attempts to
restrict this freedom can lead to nothing except a thousand and one devices
for evading the law, to a thou sand and one obstacles in the form of red
tape and bureaucracy, to the deterioration of the conditions of
the peasants. Attempts to check world capitalism by means of laws or
regulations restricting freedom to mobilise the land are just as witless as
are attempts to stop a train by means of a wattle fence. To defend such
attempts means defending serf bondage, stagnation and decay in the
rural areas.  

Anyone who has learnt the ABC of political economy knows that Russia is
undergoing a change-over from the system of serf-ownership to capitalism.


There is no “third” system of national economy in
Russia. Both the serf-owning system and capitalism signify the exploitation
of labour; in this sense both systems signify “the noose and
bondage”. But the characteristic features of the serf-owning system are:
age-long stagnation, downtrodden and ignorant toilers, and a low level of
labour productivity. The characteristic features of capitalism are: very
rapid economic and social development, an enormous increase in the
productivity of labour, elimination of the slave mentality among the
toilers and the awakening of their ability to unite and to take an
intelligent part in the affairs of life.  

Hence, to call capitalism a noose and bondage, and at the same time to
advocate, as the Narodniks do, retarding the development
of capitalism, means, in fact, defending the survivals of serfdom,
barbarism and stagnation.  

Marxists have always called and will always call the Left Narodniks
“socialist-reactionaries”, for advocating restrictions to the freedom of
mobilisation.  

We advise class-conscious workers to give battle to the Left Narodniks
and all other kinds of Narodniks, precisely on this question! It can safely
be said that the Left Narodniks will be backed by dotards, who, in addition
to defending

    

restrictions to the freedom of mobilisation, defend belief in the devil,
servility, flogging, cohabitation with daughters-in-law, and
“instructing” the womenfolk with a cudgel.  

We, on the other hand, will have the backing of the entire fresh and
literate young generation, who do not believe in devils. It is sufficient
to quote just one passage from Mr. Peshekhonov to have this generation
treat such people in the way they deserve.  


   “I said,” writes Mr. Peshekhonov, “that the peasants
   are not able to make sufficiently sensible use of mortgage loans. And this,
   of course, is quite understandable, since labour economy does not permit
   it....”  


The peasants are not “sensible”, if you please! The feudalists and
liberal government officials are “able”, if you please, to decide
for the peasant!  

This, then is the interesting, practical, small but plain question that
concerns us closely. This is the sort of question on which the
Left-Narodnik gentlemen should be ridiculed at every meeting attended by
alert and politically-conscious peasants.  

“Labour” economy is the empty, sentimental catchword of the
intellectual. Every peasant knows perfectly well that you cannot live
without buying and selling. This simple fact scatters to the winds all talk
about “labour” economy.  
 *     *  * 

The Left Narodniks throw dust in the eyes of the “muzhik” by
confusing the question of freedom of mobilisation with the advocacy of
“taking the land out of commodity circulation and converting it into
public property” (Stoikaya Mysl No. 20).  

In the first place, only crass ignoramuses can be unaware of the fact
that “converting the land into public property” does not mean
taking the land out of commodity circulation, but the opposite; it
means drawing it into that circulation more freely and rapidly,
and on a larger scale.  

Learn the political economy of Marx, Messrs. the
“socialist-reactionaries”!  

Secondly, as Marx demonstrated and proved, the radical
bourgeoisie can put forward, and have often put forward,

    

the demand for the “conversion of the land into public property”. This
cannot be disputed. But only a conservative bourgeois, not a radical, can
think that this conversion can be facilitated by the advocacy of
feudal restrictions to the freedom of mobilisation.  

As long as land is private property, any constraints imposed upon its
mobilisation are harmful and reactionary. There is no way of achieving the
ideals of labour democracy other than by ensuring the most rapid
elimination of the traces of serfdom and the most rapid development of
capitalism.  
 *     *  * 

Marxists have always said and now repeat that the peasants’ democratic
views must be divested of feudal survivals. The Narodniks deserve
support only insofar as they oppose serfdom and support
democracy. But insofar as they defend oppression and backwardness,
petty-bourgeois narrow-mindedness and selfishness, they are the greatest of
reactionaries.

In their numerous articles concerning Malinovsky’s
resignation,[1] the liquidators assert, among other slanderous things,
that Malinovsky was brought into prominence only by the “splitting
activities” of the Pravdists, that Malinovsky was a political
“weathercock”, and so on and so forth.  

Below we quote, word for word, an editorial article in the
liquidationist newspaper Luch, which the liquidators published the
day after Malinovsky was elected to the Duma, i.e., at a time when the
liquidators did not yet have to stoop to foul lies in their struggle
against their opponents.  

The following is the full text of the article (Luch,
October 28, 1912, No. 37): 
R. V. MALINOVSKY
(Deputy representing the Moscow workers)


The deputy elected by the workers of the Moscow Gubernia
   is Roman Malinovsky, former secretary of the St. Petersburg Metalworkers’
   Union. In his person the Social-Democratic group in the Duma acquires for
   the first time a prominent practical worker in the trade union movement,
   who in the grim years of reaction played an active part in the legal
   working-class organisations.  

Malinovsky has been a member of the Union since its
   foundation on May 1, 1906. At the beginning of 1907 he was elected
   Secretary of the Union and held that responsible post continuously until
   November 1909, when lie was arrested at a preliminary meeting of the first
   workers’ delegation to the Temperance Congress. Deportation from
   St. Petersburg interrupted his activities in the Union, but he continued to
   maintain ideological contact with the organisation.  

The years of Malinovsky’s secretaryship was a period in
   the life of the Union in which it had to contend, not only with severe
   external conditions, but also with the apathy of the workers
   themselves. Malinovsky’s personal example served as an effective weapon
   against this “internal enemy”.  
 

His energy seemed inexhaustible. He undertook the
   responsible task of leading a strike with the same ardour as he carried out
   the painstaking work of organisation.  

And, what is most, important, Malinovsky always strove to
   link up this day-by-day work with the general tasks of the working-class
   movement in the struggle around the problems of the day, never losing sight
   of the ultimate aim.  

Trade union work took up a great deal of Malinovsky’s
   time and energies, but his activities did not end there. In one degree or
   another he has participated in all the workers’ actions of the past few
   years. He represented the St. Petersburg workers at the Co-operative
   Congress in Moscow in 1908. At Easter 1909, he represented the
   St. Petersburg metalworkers at the First Congress of Factory Panel Doctors,
   where he read a paper on old age and disability insurance. The metalworkers
   also elected him their delegate to the Temperance Congress, but his arrest
   prevented him from attending.  

In Moscow Malinovsky’s activities have of necessity been
   more restricted. But here, too, he has not been idle; he took an active
   part in the preparations for the Second Congress of Factory Panel Doctors,
   and at one time was closely associated with the workers’ co-operative
   movement, etc 

The new Moscow deputy has always shown a lively interest
   in the political working-class movement too.  

In his convictions he is a Bolshevik. But this did not
   prevent him in 1908, when, after the London Congress, the Bolsheviks tried
   to secure Party representation on the executives of the trade unions, from
   opposing his political friends for the sake of unity of the trade union
   movement. It did not prevent him at the First Congress of Factory Panel
   Doctors from protesting against the disruptive conduct of the Moscow
   Bolsheviks in the interests of unity of the workers’ delegation.  

There is every reason to believe that the activities of
   the new workers’ deputy will be as fruitful in the political field as they
   have been in the trade union movement.  


Such were the complimentary terms in which the liquidators
themselves wrote about the Bolshevik Malinovsky two years ago. Could
they have written otherwise, considering the work that Malinovsky was doing
in the sight of all the workers?  Even the liquidators, who at
that time were already his political opponents, could not but treat him
with pro found respect. They spoke of his preceding activities, which had
already brought him to the fore, in terms that were most flattering to
Malinovsky. They held him up as an example to others, There was not a word
about his being a “weathercock”. Nor was the fairy-tale yet invented that
ho had been returned to the Duma as a candidate of liquidationist
“unity”.  
 

A fortnight later the first meeting of the united Social-Democratic
group in the Duma was held. The liquidators themselves unanimously elected
Malinovsky as the vice-chairman of the group, in exactly the same way as
they had previously supported his candidacy as chairman of workers’
delegations to public congresses (the Congress of Factory Panel Doctors,
for example), and so forth. After the Duma elections, the most prominent
member of the August bloc (the pillar of today’s journal Borba)
wrote letters to Malinovsky couched in the most flattering terms, in which
he all but called him a future Bebel.  

But when it was discovered that Malinovsky sharply opposed
liquidationism, when he took a step which he him self shortly afterwards
had to admit was a profoundly erroneous one, the liquidators poured upon
the ex-deputy, upon whom they had previously showered their praise, the
filthiest slander they could collect in the garbage heaps of the
Black-Hundred newspapers.  

Everybody knows that with his political background and talents
Malinovsky could have played an important role in any political group, and
that the liquidators would have honoured him had he associated himself with
them. But the liquidators are not ashamed to say that Malinovsky was pushed
into the forefront by the “split”.  

It makes one blush with shame to see people using a man’s
private misfortune in their struggle against a hostile political trend. We
have no desire to compare Malinovsky with
Khrustalev[2] but what would the liquidators have said, after what
happened to Khrustalev, had their political opponents made the fate of this
one man an excuse for discrediting Menshevism, and “used” the Khrustalev
case against the entire Menshevik trend? And yet it is common knowledge
that Khrustalev was a Menshevik, that he was their prominent representative
at the London Congress, in the press, and so forth. It is common knowledge
that at one time the Mensheviks were proud of Khrustalev.  

The Pravdists have no lack of political opponents; but not a
single hostile newspaper—with the exception, perhaps, of the
Dubrovinites and Purishkevich’s paper—has sunk so low as the
liquidationist newspaper has sunk these days. Even the liberals have
behaved far more decently.  
 

To hurl the most incredible insults at an opponent and then to end up
with a long-winded appeal for ... unity with this very slandered
opponent—such are the mean, canting and despicable tactics of all these
Martovs and Dans.  

Their disgusting conduct in connection with Malinovsky’s resignation
should open the eyes even of the blind.

R.S.D.L.P. Duma group, from the Fourth Duma. For this act of
disorganisation and for deserting his post, Malinovsky was expelled from
the Party. Eventually, it was discovered that Malinovsky was an agent
provocateur. He was tried by the Supreme Tribunal of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee in 1918 and sentenced to be shot.

In an article which attracted the attention of the
class-conscious workers, An, leader of the Caucasian liquidators, recently
announced that he disagreed with Luch and its successors,
disagreed with their opportunist tactics.  

This statement implies the break-up of the “August bloc”, a
fact no subterfuges or tricks can refute.  

At present, however, We wish to draw the readers’ attention to
something else, namely, to An’s argument about Russia’s two paths of
development. He writes: 


   “Luch bases its tactic on the possibility of
   reform, it aims at reform. Pravda bases its tactic on a ‘storm’,
   it aims at a break-up.”  


From this An draws the conclusion that the two tactics have to
be united. This conclusion is wrong. It is not a Marxist conclusion.  

Let us examine the matter.  

By what is Russia’s path, the nature and speed of her
development, determined?  

By the alignment of social forces, by the resultant of the class
struggle.  

That is obvious.  

What social forces operate in Russia? What is the line of the class
struggle?  

Russia is a capitalist country; she cannot but develop
capitalistically. Russia is now undergoing a bourgeois-democratic
transformation, a release from the serf-owning system, emancipation. Under
conditions of world capitalism Russia’s emancipation is inevitable. What we
do not yet know is the resultant of the social forces that are working
towards emancipation. These forces, in the main, are:
1) bourgeois monarchist liberalism (the capitalists and some of the
landlords of the Progressist, Cadet and partly Octobrist

    

parties);
2) the bourgeois democrats (the peasantry, urban petty bourgeois,
intellectuals, and so on);
3) the proletariat.  

Each of these classes acts—we take only the action of the masses, of
course—in line with the economic position of the given class. There can
be only one resultant.  

In what sense, then, can we speak of Russia’s two paths? Only in the
sense that, until the outcome of the struggle, we do not and shall not know
this resultant, which will approach one of the two simplest and
clearest lines visible at once to everybody. The first line is “reform”,
the second a “storm”.  

Reform is the name given to changes which leave the power in the
country in the hands of the old ruling class. Changes of the opposite order
are called “storms”. The class interests of bourgeois liberalism demand
only reforms, since the bourgeoisie is more afraid of “storms”
than of reaction, and wishes to keep the old feudalist institutions (the
bureaucracy, two chambers, and so on) as protection against the
workers. The peasantry in all countries of the world without exception,
Russia included, vacillates, in the matter of bourgeois-democratic reform,
between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Such vacillation is
inevitable, since the peasants are opposed to the landlords and serfdom
while themselves being petty proprietors and petty bourgeois.  

As for the proletariat, its interests, which coincide with those of the
vast majority of the population, of all the exploited, move in a direction
that is not reformist, along a path which is described in Russia
as that of the “three pillars”.  

If the majority of the peasants and the population follow the liberals,
the “path” will be the worst, the least advantageous to the workers and
the exploited, and the most painful to them. If the majority of the
peasants and the population follow the workers, the reverse will be the
case. One resultant or the other will be fully revealed only by the final
outcome of the struggle.  

We now see the true implications of An’s vague and confused
argument. He has sensed rather than understood the liquidators’ opportunism
and their betrayal of the working class.  
 

The liquidators are reformists. They pursue, in effect, a
liberal-labour, not a Marxist workers’ policy. They are trying to
subordinate the workers to the bourgeoisie.  

The Pravdists are pursuing a Marxist and proletarian policy by
defending the interests of the working class in the matter of transforming
Russia. Do the Pravdists over look the possibilities of reform? This
question is easily answered by referring to the facts. Take insurance
reform, which is something real, and not dreamt up. Everyone sees that the
Pravdists seized on this ten times more strongly than the liquidators did:
see Voprosy
Strakhovania[1] and the results of the elections to the All-Russia
Insurance Board.  

Take the “partial demands” of the economic struggle during
strikes. Everyone knows that the Pravdists are conducting this real and not
dreamt-up campaign a thousand times more intensely and energetically.  

If there were a group that denied the use of reforms and partial
improvements, we could not join it, because that would be a
non-Marxist policy, a policy harmful to the workers.  

Neither could we join the liquidators, because repudiation and abuse of
the “underground”, repudiation and relegation of the two “pillars”, the
advocacy in present-day Russia of a struggle for a legal party and the
possibility of political reforms—all this is a betrayal of the working
class, desertion to the bourgeoisie.  

The Pravdists, in the words of An, “aim at a storm and break-up”
but, as the facts show, miss no opportunity, how ever slight, of supporting
real reforms and partial improvements and explaining to the masses the sham
of reformism. This is the only correct, the only truly Marxist tactic, and
that is why it has been adopted by the overwhelming majority of the
class-conscious workers throughout Russia (this has been proved by the
facts, by the number of workers’ groups).  

Only adherents of petty-bourgeois democracy, the Narodniks and the
liquidators, are vainly fighting against the workers, against Pravdism.

October 1913 to March 1918. It worked not only for the achievement of
workers’ unsurance but for the Bolshevik
“uncurtailed slogans” of an eight-hour day, confiscation of the landed
estates and a democratic republic. Prominent insurance campaigners—the
Bolsheviks N. A. Skripnik, P. I. Stu&cwhattheka, A. N. Vinokurov,

Plekhanov, as we know, has often found himself in an
awkward fix on questions of tactics and organisation. During the past
eleven years (since the autumn of 1903, when he went over from the
Bolsheviks to the Mensheviks) he has repeatedly and comically made a muddle
of these questions.  

He is beginning to get muddled again, a sad circumstance we feel
obliged to acquaint our readers with. But first of all, we will recall the
great service that Plekhanov rendered during the difficult years
(1909–11). He praised the “underground” and staunchly supported the
Party decisions on combating liquidationism. He exposed the, opportunism of
the liquidators and their revival of Economism (a bourgeois trend in
Marxism in 1894–1902). He showed that, by repudiating the “underground”,
the liquidators were betraying the Party. He quite rightly explained that
“Mr. Potresov” was a Judas, and that the apostles were stronger
without Judas than with him.  

These were clear, definite and integral ideas, fully in keeping with
the decisions of 1908 and 1910.  

But look at Plekhanov’s new volte-face. In the newspaper
Yedinstvo[1] he now denounces the Pravdists for their
“factionalism” and “usurpation”, and asserts that we have “not one
working-class press but two”.  

This is not very literate, but the meaning is clear. A liquidationist
newspaper is declared a working-class newspaper! Fancy that! And yet this
selfsame Plekhanov had argued that the resolution declaring liquidationism
to be a manifestation of bourgeois influence on the proletariat
was a correct one.  

It is useless for Plekhanov to try to forget this. The workers will
only ridicule such forgetfulness.  
 

The liquidationist press is not a workers’ press, but one that
serves as a vehicle of bourgeois influence on the
proletariat. This has been definitely and clearly stated in the
decision of the “entire Marxist
body”,[2] and the liquidators are to this day strikingly corroborating
it (see, for example, the concordant remarks of Bulkin and Martov
against the “underground” in Nasha Zarya, 1914, No. 3).


What is the meaning of Plekhanov’s appeals for unity with the
liquidators?  Unity with the group of publicists who repudiate the
“underground” in true Potresov style? To advocate such unity one must
advocate repudiation of the “underground”!  

Plekhanov has got into such a muddle that he does not know where he
stands.  

The liquidators have made it abundantly clear in Nasha Zarya,
in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta (run by F. D. and L. M.) and through
the agency of Chkheidze and Co., that they stand their ground,
i. e., they defend Potresov and tolerate abuse of the “underground”. They
defend the idea of a legal workers’ party.  

But Plekhanov condemns liquidationism as a crime against the Party
while at the same time advocating “unity” with the liquidators.  

We can only smile at this.  

The Pravdists warmly welcome all workers who really want to recognise
the “form” which Potresov rejects; as for the empty phrases about
“unity” with the opponents of the “underground”, they regard them as
empty phrases from people who know not what they want.  

The Pravdists calmly meet the charge of being “usurpers” by saying:
Does not one who is fond of declaiming, who is fond of phrases and dreads
the facts, resemble a usurper and impostor? Plekhanov lives
abroad; why is he so modestly reticent about the fact that from August 1912
to May 1914 the liquidators have not published a single
issue of their newspaper abroad? Neither have they published
a single factual reference to “organisations” which Plekhanov
too has defended.  

The opponents of the liquidators, however, have published a number of
factual references to all localities in Russia, in a
number of issues.  
 

Plekhanov says nothing about these facts, because the facts refute his
phrases.  

Take the openly verifiable data published in Russia. During two full
years, 1912 and 1913, the Pravdists united (and proved this by
group collections) 2,801 workers’ groups; the liquidators united
750. If we add 1914, from February 1 to May 6 (preliminary
estimate), we shall have 5,302 as against 1,382.  

The Pravdists have a majority of about four-fifths!  

Naturally, the only thing that people who dread the facts can
do is to keep on uttering phrases.  

Around the precise and clear decisions, thrice supplemented and
verified by the representatives of the workers (in January 1912 and in
February and the summer of 1913), the Pravdists united four-fifths
of the class-conscious workers in Russia. These decisions have been
amplified in hundreds of articles and have been put into effect.  

Now these are not phrases, not fables, not anecdotes about goitres and
savages (Plekhanov is still retailing old jokes!) but facts. This
is real unity, unity of the workers, who have tested
their tactics by experience.  

To slightingly call these tactics “Leninist”—tactics which have
been approved by thousands of workers—is only a compliment to Lenin, but
it does not do away with the 5,000 workers’ groups, with their
unity, or with their Party.  

The catchwords “factionalism”, “fragmentation”, “disintegration”,
and so forth, apply to Plekhanov and his present-day friends. Look at the
list of contributors to the intellectualist Narodnik journal
Sovremennik, published on page 1 of Plekhanov’s
Yedinstvo. Here we have Himmer and Co. who preach
anti-Marxist ideas. Plekhanov was right when he described them as
the ideas of “socialist-reactionaries”. Here we have the
god-builders and Machists: Bogdanov, Bazarov and Lunacharsky. Here we have
the liquidators: Dan, Martov and Cherevanin (for some reason Potresov,
mentioned in No. 66 of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta, is missing from
the list). Here also we have the liberal Bogucharsky, and so forth.  

And in this Sovremennik, which lacks the faintest trace of
anything working-class, Mr. Himmer openly boasts that

    

Plekhanov is in favour of unity with him! But Plekhanov is silent.


Is it not time to doff the mask, before the workers tear it off,
perhaps rudely!  Among intellectualist anti-Marxist circles, among
the flotsam of bourgeois democracy—this is where poor Plekhanov has
accidentally landed. This is where you will find chaos, disintegration and
tiny factions, which are opposing the unity achieved in the course of two
years by thousands of workers’ groups of the Pravdist trend.  

We are sorry for Plekhanov. Considering the struggle he waged against
the opportunists, Narodniks, Machists and liquidators, he deserves a better
fate. We shall, however, continue to build up the unity of the workers’
groups—already built to the extent of four-fifths—which pursue definite
tactics tested by experience.  

We shall accept anybody and everybody who renounces liquidationism; the
door is not locked.  

With the example of Trotsky’s Borba and Plekhanov’s
Yedinstvo before our eyes, we shall show the deplorable and
ridiculous vacillations of the intellectualist grouplets which, cut off
from the working-class movement, keep on vacillating, swing to one side one
day and to the other side the next, from the weak-kneed intellectual
Potresov to the weak kneed intellectual Himmer.  

This is a sad spectacle, but one that is inevitable in a
petty-bourgeois country in the epoch of bourgeois-democratic
transformations.

Our government considers its new agrarian policy—that of
stepping up the destruction of the village communes by means of the rural
superintendents[3] and of encouraging the otrub system—a
highly effective weapon in its struggle against the revolution. Already in
1906, soon after the revolution, the Council of the United
Nobility[4] called upon the government to introduce private
landownership among the peasantry so as to create, as quickly as possible,
a class of rich peasants that would side with the landlords against the
peasant masses. Stolypin immediately adopted the policy recommended by the
Council of the United Nobility. The landlord parties in the Third Duma, the
Rights and the Octobrists, whole-heartedly supported this new agrarian
policy, which they regarded, not only as an effective means of combating
the revolution, but as a great advance towards the European economic
system, a step towards eliminating the survivals of serfdom.  

As is known, the praises of the new agrarian policy, which is
represented as an instrument of “emancipation”, have been sung in a
thousand different keys in the governmental, Right, and Octobrist press.


It is from this standpoint that I wish, in my speech, to deal with the
principles underlying the government’s policy on the agrarian
question. We are told on every hand that the number of land plots
“registered” as private property and the number of otrubs are
increasing. But nothing is said about the extent to which bondage and
feudal relations still exist in our rural districts. Yet that is the crux
of the matter. We are promised a “European” reform of our backward
agriculture, with the class of the feudalist Purishkeviches

    

retaining full economic and political power. The promises remain promises,
but what is the state of affairs in the countryside today, after
all the progress the government boasts of? To what extent are the peasant
masses still borne down by bondage and feudalist oppression?  

To answer this question I shall call to witness a journal whose editor
recently won well-merited and enthusiastic praise from Anthony, Bishop
of Volhynia himself, and, of course, from writers like Rozanov of
Novoye Vremya, who are notoriously reactionary and notoriously
ready to serve the government. This is not a “Left” journal, God forbid!
It is a journal run by people who have echoed all the abuse and
vituperation the reactionaries heap on the revolution. It is a journal
which stands up stoutly for clericalism and the sanctity of landlord
property. You probably guess that I am referring to Russkaya Mysl.


This journal, by way of exception, spoke the truth and quoted figures,
precise figures, showing the extent to which things like
métayage and winter hiring are practised in
Russia. Everybody knows that these are common everyday features in our
countryside. But “everybody” prefers to speak about everything under the
sun except these everyday features.  


   “Winter hiring,” writes this journal, “is this not
   absurd in our age, the age of electricity and aeroplanes? And yet this form
   of slavery and bondage continues to flourish to this day, like a leech on
   the body of the nation.... Winter hiring has preserved in all its freshness
   the feudal term of ‘bonded’ peasants.”  


This appraisal of winter hiring is not mine, but that of a journal
notorious for its hatred of revolution. Slavery, bondage, serfdom—this is
what quite “loyal” people are compelled to call “the order of
things” existing in our countryside.  

In winter hiring: 


   “the peasant accepts the hardest conditions, as little
   as a half and a third of the pay he usually receives in spring and summer
   hiring. In winter he gets paid as much per dessiatine for ploughing (three
   times), sowing, reaping or mowing, binding, and carting to the threshing
   shed as he does in summer only for harvesting (reaping and binding).”
   


How many peasants abide in this state of serfdom, bondage and slavery?

 


   “According to local reports, in the spring of
   1913 the number of ‘bonded’ households in some villages of the
   South-West was as much as 48 per cent of the total, in Mogilev Gubernia 52
   per cent, and in Chernigov Gubernia 56 per cent.”  


And this, mind you, refers to the spring of 1913! This is after the
harvest of 1912! This was during the alleged sensational successes of the
so-called “land organisation”, which the government is boasting of and
proclaiming from the house-tops!  

What else, after that, can you call this notorious “land
organisation” but a whited sepulchre, which masks the same old serfdom?


Half the peasant households are “bonded”, enslaved through dire
poverty. Hunger, hunger even during a good crop year, makes the peasants
give their labour in thrall to the landlord in winter for a third of the
pay. In practice, this amounts to a continuation of the corvée, of
serfdom, because the very essence of serfdom is preserved in the shape of a
pauperised, starving, ruined peasant, who, even in the best year, is
compelled to till the landlord’s land with his poor implements and
half-starved animals on terms of “winter hiring”.  

Let the number of plots registered as private property increase. This
may even be a useful measure in regard to those proletarians who will rid
themselves of a burden and be freer to fight for liberty and socialism.


But, obviously, no “registrations”, no “blessings” of private
ownership can help those millions of households, those tens of millions of
peasants, who have nowhere to go to from the village and are
compelled to give themselves in winter in thrall to the landlords.  

These peasants are bound to strive towards a transfer of all the landed
estates into their hands without payment, for this is the only way
out for them, the only escape from hopeless enslavement. Communal
landownership has nothing to do with it. Both the homesteader and the
fullest “individual proprietor” will, like the commune peasant, remain
for ever downtrodden slaves if they are unable to make their crop last
longer than St. Nicholas
       Day[1]

and

    

are compelled to borrow from the landlord on usurious terms.  

It is absurd, as far as these tens of millions of peasants are
concerned, to speak about the “progress” of farming, about a “rising
level of agriculture”, about improved methods of working the land, and so
forth. What improved methods can there be when dire poverty makes the
peasant hire himself out to the landlord at a third of the pay, while in
the summer his own grain is spilling because in the summer the police will
drag him away to work for the “squire” in payment for the
advances of grain or money he has had from him!  

And the landlord, who advances grain or money for winter hiring, is
quite unlike the “European” employer, or any capitalist employer for that
matter. He is not an employer, but a usurer or a feudal lord. Improved
methods are not only unnecessary under such a “system of farming”, but
positively undesirable. They are both unnecessary and
detrimental to it. A ruined, pauperised, starving peasant with
half-starved animals and wretched implements—that is what this landlord
system of farming needs, a system that is perpetuating
the backwardness of Russia and the misery of the peasants. With the bulk of
the peasant population living under such conditions of serf dependence,
these conditions would continue for decades to come, until the peasants
liberated themselves from this yoke; for the creation of a small minority
of rich “otrub farmers”, or the establishment of private
holdings and their sale by the proletarians, would have no effect whatever
on the enslaved position of the peasant masses.  

This is what the praisers of the new, Stolypin agrarian policy forget,
or rather try to forget, try to obscure and screen. They all sing in chorus
that this policy means “progress”, but what they do not say is
that this progress affects a very small minority and is proceeding at a
snail’s pace, while the majority are in the same old state of
bondage and serfdom.  

The number of otrub farmers is increasing, more machines are
being imported into Russia, grass cultivation is developing, and the number
of co-operative societies in the rural districts is growing. All that is
true, defenders of the government!

    

But there is the reverse of the medal, which you are trying to conceal. For
all this much-vaunted progress, most of the peasants are still in a state
of feudal slavery. That is what makes all this “progress” so
meager and precarious; that is what makes famines
inevitable; that is what makes the home market so weak and wretched; that
is what enables oppression and tyranny to maintain such a firm hold, and
that is what increases the inevitability of another agrarian
revolution, because all the greater is the contradiction between an age of
aeroplanes, electricity and automobiles, and “winter hiring” or
“métayage”.  

And here are the latest figures on métayage in Russia,
given in the journal, approved of by Anthony of Volhynia. The peasants’
crops cultivated on the métayer system amounted to 21 per cent of
the crops on their own lands in the Central gubernias, to 42 per cent in
the Lake gubernias, and to 68 per cent in the North-Western gubernias! The
corresponding figures for grass mowing are 50 per cent in the Central
gubernias, and 110-185 per cent in the Lake, Trans-Volga and North-Western
gubernias!  

Thus, métayer haymaking predominates over the peasants’
own haymaking in three vast regions of Russia!  

What is the “métayer system”?  


   “The peasant, using the landlord’s land but his own
   seeds, does all the cultivation and harvesting down to carting the sheaves
   to the threshing shed, and takes only half the crop for himself. The hay
   meadows are worked on a “one-third” system, the
   métayer taking one haycock to every two that go to the landlord.”
   


But that is not all.  


   “In some cases (especially in Minsk and Chernigov
   gubernias), the métayer, in addition to paying for the land with
   half the crop, and for the hay with two-thirds of the crop, is obliged
   to work gratis on the owner’s farm for one or two weeks, in most cases with
   his own horse, or with one of his children.”  


What is this if not the corvée, pure and simple? What is this if
not the ancient serf system of farming?  

There is nothing new in these figures whatever. On the contrary—they
reveal to us the hoary past, which has survived in all its monstrous
aspects side by side with the “new” agrarian policy. Anyone in
touch with rural life has long been aware of the existence of this hoary
past. Statisticians

    

and observers of country life have written dozens and hundreds of hooks
about that past. And that hoary past predominates to this day, perpetuating
the scandalous backwardness and scandalous tyranny that reign in Russia.


No laws can put a stop to this serfdom so long as the bulk of the land
remains the property of the all-powerful landlords. No “private
landownership” in place of the “communes” of downtrodden peasants can be
of any help.  

According to the official statistics on landownership for 1905
published by the Ministry of the Interior less than 30,000
landlords in European Russia own seventy million dessiatines of
land.

to protect the autocratic system, the big landed estates, and the
privileges of the nobility. Lenin called the Council of the United Nobility
“a council of united feudalists”. The Council virtually became a
semi-government body, which dictated to the government legislative measures
aimed at protecting the interests of the feudalists. A considerable number
of its members were members of the Council of State and of the leading
centres of the Black-Hundred organisations.

“The workers are tired of splits. The workers want
unity. The workers are disgusted at the fact that the split sometimes even
takes the form of brawling....”  

Such and similar statements can sometimes be heard from workers.  

The workers do need unity. And the important thing to remember is that
nobody but themselves will “give” them unity, that nobody
can help them achieve unity. Unity cannot be “promised”—that would
be vain boasting, self-deception; unity cannot be “created” out of
“agreements” between intellectualist groups. To think so is a profoundly
sad, na\"ive, and ignorant delusion.  

Unity must be won, and only the workers, the class-conscious
workers themselves can win it—by stubborn and persistent effort.  

Nothing is easier than to write the word “unity” in yard-long
letters, to promise it and to “proclaim” oneself an advocate of unity. In
reality, however, unity can be furthered only by the efforts and
organisation of the advanced workers, of all the class-conscious
workers.  

Unity without organisation is impossible. Organisation is impossible
unless the minority bows to the majority.  

These are incontestible truths. Nobody will question them. The
only—only!—thing is to put them into effect. That is not easy. That
requires effort, perseverance, the solidarity of all class-conscious
workers. But without that effort there is no use talking about
working-class unity.  

The resolution adopted by the Amsterdam International Congress presses
for the unity of the workers’ parties in all
countries.[1] This resolution is correct. It demands the unity
of the workers, but with us attempts are being made to

    

substitute for it the unity of intellectualist groups which refuse to
bow to the will of the workers!  

It would be ridiculous, were it not so sad.  

During the last two-and-a-half years (since January 1, 1912), the
majority of the class-conscious workers all over Russia have, in fact,
united around the Pravdist decisions adopted in January 1912, in
February 1913 and in the sum mer of 1913. This is proved by precise figures
showing the number of workers’ groups in which collections have been made
for various newspapers. The various intellectualist groups which cannot
find any backing among the mass of the workers may ignore these figures and
pass them over in silence, but they cannot do away with them. It only shows
that the various intellectualist groups are cut off from the masses of the
workers and are afraid of the truth.  

The number of workers’ groups in which collections were made for
newspapers in St. Petersburg: 





 
Pravdist
Liquida- tionist




For the two full years, 1912 and 1913 . . . . . .   
2,801
750


For half of 1914 (January 1 to May 13) . . . . . .  
2,873
671


   Total . . . . . . . . 
5,674
1,421




These figures, which have been published many times and have never been
revised or challenged, show that the liquidators have the support of
only one-fifth of the class-conscious workers (and their figures
include all their allies:
the Caucasians, Trotskyists, Bundists and the Letts; their allies are now
falling away from them; the Letts have already done so).


Thus, four-fifths of the workers have accepted the Pravdist decisions
as their own, have approved of Pravdism, and actually
rallied around Pravdism.  

Now this is real unity of the workers, not of intellectualist
groups, unity in deed, not merely in word, unity as a result of
two-and-a-half years of effort in the working-class movement all over
Russia, not a mere promise of unity.  

It is for this unity, for submission to this four-fifths majority of
the workers, that we must go on fighting. There is not, nor can there
be, any other way to unity. The workers are not infants to believe
that this four-fifths majority will

    

allow the minority of one-fifth, or intellectuals who have no workers’
backing at all, to flout the will of the majority of the workers!
The very idea is ridiculous and absurd.  

Let those who want to abuse the Pravdists and call them “usurpers” do
so. Let this abuse unite the liquidators, Plekhanov, Trotsky, the
Vperyodists, the Bundists, and anybody else who pleases. This is abuse
coming from impotent little groups, who are angry at their own
impotence. This clamour for “unity” on the part of impotent little
groups, which have cut themselves off from the masses of the workers, is
sheer hypocrisy, for it is they who are violating unity, it is
they who are flouting the will of the majority by their splitting
tactics.  

These groups are striving in vain. Their abuse is not worth taking
notice of. The Pravdist workers are building up and will continue to build
up the unity of the workers, despite all vituperation from angry
but impotent intellectualist groups.

A recent issue of Der
Kampf,[2] the Austrian
Social-Democratic monthly, contained a sensational paragraph signed F. A.,
stating that Eduard Bernstein, leader of the German opportunists, had
renounced his revisionist, opportunist views and returned to Marxism.  

Revisionism—revision of Marxism—is today one of the chief
manifestations, if not the chief, of bourgeois influence on the proletariat
and bourgeois corruption of the workers. That is why Eduard Bernstein, the
opportunist leader, has won such world-wide notoriety.  

And now we are told that Bernstein has returned to Marxism. This piece
of news should seem strange to anyone at all familiar with German
Social-Democratic literature. Sozialistische
  Monatshefte,[1]

the principal organ of the opportunists, is still published and continues
to preach purely bourgeois views which, in effect, amount to a complete
betrayal of socialism. And Bernstein continues to be a leading contributor
to the journal. What can the matter be?  

It appears that Bernstein gave a lecture in Budapest in which,
according to a local paper, he renounced revisionism.  

F. A., the Austrian author, has proved exceedingly gullible and
imprudent in hastening to proclaim to the world that Bernstein has revised
his views. But the liquidator V. Levitsky, one of the leading opportunist
contributors to the opportunist journal Alaska Zarya (the
Menshevik Plekhanov has dubbed it the Russian “Socialist
Monthly”) has proved more imprudent still: in Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta (April 3, No. 46) he published a lengthy article under the
resonant title of “From Revisionism to Marxism”, based wholly on
F. A.’s report.  
 

Mr. Levitsky did not even wait for Bernstein’s lecture to appear in the
press. A fool’s haste is no speed.  

On learning what world-wide “fame” his Budapest lecture had won,
Bernstein wrote a letter to the Brussels Social-Democratic paper
Le Peuple[3] on April 11 (new style) in which he bluntly
declared: “The report in Der Kampf is absolutely without
foundation. I said nothing new in Budapest and did not recant any of the
views expressed in Premises of Socialism [Bernstein’s chief
opportunist work]. The report of my lecture in the Budapest paper simply
confused my words with the remarks of the reporter!”  

The whole affair proved an ordinary newspaper hoax.  

It did, however, reveal the deplorable proneness of some Austrian (only
Austrian?) Social-Democrats to disguise opportunism and proclaim
its disappearance.  

Excessive zeal has carried Mr. Levitsky to preposterous lengths. He
writes in Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta: “With the reversion [?] to
Marxism of the father [?] of revisionism, Bernstein, revisionism within the
German Social-Democratic movement has been killed for good [!?].”  

Every word here is a gem: there has been no reversion, Bernstein is no
father, revisionism has not been killed.  


   “In Russia,” the zealous Mr. Levitsky writes,
   “revisionism has ceased to be a modish doctrine even among the Left
   Narodniks, who at one time were inclined to fall back on it in their fight
   against Marxism. Within the Russian Social-Democratic movement revisionism
   had no influence whatever, despite the attempts of some writers to
   transplant it to Russian soil.”  


Every word here is an untruth. On all major issues the Left
Narodniks even now “fall back on” the revisionist “doctrines”. That is
proved by every issue of Russkoye Bogatstvo and Zavety,
by every issue of Stoikaya Mysl. Glossing over the opportunism of
the Left Narodniks can only cause harm.  

There has been some revisionist influence within Russian
Social-Democracy since the very beginning of the mass
working-class and mass Social-Democratic movement in 1895–96. Does
Mr. Levitsky mean to say he has not heard of the struggle which consistent
Marxists and adherents of the old Iskra waged for many years
against the Economists? Does he mean to say he has not heard of the Party
resolutions and

    

the numerous articles written during that period, affirming, proving and
explaining that Economism was the Russian form of revisionism and
opportunism? Does Mr. Levitsky mean to say he has forgotten about
Mr. A. Martynov, a leading liquidator of today, and a leading Economist of
yesterday?  

Mr. Levitsky denies revisionism in order to disguise his own
revisionism. We would remind him only of the four following facts:
1) Was it not the Menshevik Plekhanov who declared in the press in 1909–10
that the Mensheviks had absorbed into their ranks quite a number of
opportunist elements?
2)Was it not the same Plekhanov who demonstrated the opportunist nature of
the liquidationist “light-for-legality” slogan?
3) Was it not several anti-liquidationist Mensheviks who
demonstrated the connection between liquidationism and Economism?
=

4) Is it not opportunism to renounce, as Koltsov does, “two pillars” (out
of the three) as unsuitable for agitation?  

These four facts alone—and forty-four more could be cited—are clear
proof that the Economism of 1895–1902, the Menshevism of 1903–08 and the
liquidationism of 1908–14, all represent the Russian form or species of
opportunism and revisionism, no more and no less.

 The questions of the present-day working-class movement are
in many respects vexed questions, particularly for representatives of that
movement’s recent past (i. e., of the stage which historically has just
drawn to a close). This applies primarily to the questions of so-called
factionalism, splits, and so forth. One often hears intellectuals in the
working-class movement making nervous, feverish and almost hysterical
appeals not to raise these vexed questions. Those who have experienced the
long years of struggle between the various trends among Marxists since
1900—01, for example, may naturally think it superfluous to repeat many of
the arguments on the subject of these vexed questions.  

 But there are not many people left today who took part in the
fourteen-year-old conflict among Marxists (not to speak of the eighteen- or
nineteen-year-old conflict, counting from the moment the first symptoms of
Economism appeared). The vast majority of the workers who now make up the
ranks of the Marxists either do not remember the old conflict, or have
never heard of it. To the overwhelming majority (as, incidentally, was
shown by the opinion poll held by our
journal[5]), these vexed questions are a matter of exception ally great
interest. We therefore intend to deal with these questions, which have been
raised as it were anew (and for the younger generation of the
workers they are really new) by Trotsky’s “non-factional workers’
journal”, Borba.  
I. “FACTIONALISM”

 Trotsky calls his new journal “non-factional”. He puts this word in
the top line in his advertisements; this word is stressed by him in every
key, in the editorial articles of Borba itself, as well as in the
liquidationist Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta, which carried an
article on Borba by Trotsky before the latter began publication.



 What is this “non-factionalism”?  

 Trotsky’s “workers’ journal” is Trotsky’s journal for
workers, as there is not a trace in it of either workers’ initiative, or
any connection with working-class organisations. Desiring to write in a
popular style, Trotsky, in his journal for workers, explains for the
benefit of his readers the meaning of such foreign words as “territory”,
“factor”, and so forth.  

 Very good. But why not also explain to the workers the meaning of the
word “non-factionalism”? Is that word more intelligible than the
words “territory” and “factor”?  

 No, that is not the reason. The reason is that the label
“non-factionalism” is used by the worst representatives of the worst
remnants of factionalism to mislead the younger generation of
workers. It is worth while devoting a little time to explaining this.  

 Group-division was the main distinguishing feature of the
Social-Democratic Party during a definite historical period. Which period?
From 1903 to 1911.  

 To explain the nature of this group-division more clearly we must
recall the concrete conditions that existed in, say, 1906—07. At that time
the Party was united, there was no split, but group-division existed,
i. e., in the united Party there were virtually two groups, two
virtually separate organisations. The local workers’ organisations were
united, but on every important issue the two groups devised two sets of
tactics. The advocates of the respective tactics disputed among themselves
in the united workers’ organisations (as was the case, for example, during
the discussion of the slogan: a Duma, or Cadet, Ministry, in 1906, or
during the elections of delegates to the London Congress in 1907), and
questions were decided by a majority vote. One group was defeated
at the Stockholm Unity Congress (1906), the other was defeated at the
London Unity Congress (1907).  

 These are commonly known facts in the history of organised Marxism in
Russia.  

 It is sufficient to recall these commonly known facts to realise what
glaring falsehoods Trotsky is spreading.  

 For over two years, since 1912, there has been no factionalism
among the organised Marxists in Russia, no disputes over tactics in
united organisations, at united conferences and
congresses. There is a complete break between the

 

Party, which in January 1912 formally announced that the liquidators do
not belong to it, and the liquidators. Trotsky often calls this state
of affairs a “split”, and we shall deal with this appellation separately
later on. But it remains an undoubted fact that the term “factionalism”
deviates from the truth.  

 As we have said, this term is a repetition, an uncritical,
unreasonable, senseless repetition of what was true yesterday,
i. e., in the period that has already passed. When Trotsky talks to us
about the “chaos of factional strife” (see No. 1, pp. 5, 6, and many
others) we realise at once which period of the past his words
echo.  

 Consider the present state of affairs from the viewpoint of the young
Russian workers who now constitute nine-tenths of the organised Marxists in
Russia. They see three mass expressions of the different views, or
trends in the working-class movement: the Pravdists, gathered around a
newspaper with a circulation of 40,000; the liquidators (15,000
circulation) and the Left Narodniks (10,000 circulation). The circulation
figures tell the reader about the mass character of a given tenet.


 The question arises; what has “chaos” got to do with it? Everybody
knows that Trotsky is fond of high-sounding and empty phrases. But the
catchword “chaos” is not only phrase-mongering; it signifies
also the transplanting, or rather, a vain attempt to transplant,
to Russian soil, in the present period, the relations that existed
abroad in a bygone period. That is the whole point.  

 There is no “chaos” whatever in the struggle between the Marxists and
the Narodniks. That, we hope, not even Trotsky will dare to
deny. The struggle between the Marxists and the Narodniks has been going on
for over thirty years, ever since Marxism came into being. The cause of
this struggle is the radical divergence of interests and viewpoints of two
different classes, the proletariat and the peasantry. If there is any
“chaos” anywhere, it is only in the heads of cranks who fail to
understand this.  

 What, then, remains? “Chaos” in the struggle between the Marxists and
the liquidators? That, too, is wrong, for a struggle against a
trend, which the entire Party recognised as a trend and condemned
as far back as 1908, cannot be

 

called chaos. And everybody who has the least concern for the history of
Marxism in Russia knows that liquidationism is most closely and inseverably
connected, even as regards its leaders and supporters, with Menshevism
(1903—08) and Economism (1894—1903). Consequently, here, too, we have a
history extending over nearly twenty years. To regard the history of one’s
own Party as “chaos” reveals an unpardonable empty-headedness.  

 Now let us examine the present situation from the point of
view of Paris or Vienna. At once the whole picture
changes. Besides the Pravdists and liquidators, we see no less
than five Russian groups claiming membership of one and the same
Social-Democratic Party: Trotsky’s group, two Vperyod groups, the
“pro-Party Bolsheviks” and the “pro-Party
Mensheviks”.[6] All Marxists in Paris and in Vienna (for the purpose
of illustration I take two of the largest centres) are perfectly well aware
of this.  

 Here Trotsky is right in a certain sense; this is indeed
group-division, chaos indeed!  

 Groups within the Party, i. e., nominal unity (all claim to
belong to one Party) and actual disunity (for, in fact, all the groups are
independent of one another and enter into negotiations and agreements with
each other as sovereign powers).  

“Chaos”, i. e., the absence of
(1) objective and verifiable proof that these groups are linked with the
working-class movement in Russia and
(2) absence of any data to enable us to judge the actual ideological and
political physiognomy of these groups. Take a period of two full
years—1912 and 1913. As everybody knows, this was a period of the revival
and upswing of the working-class movement, when every trend or tendency of
a more or less mass character (and in politics this mass character
alone counts) could not but exercise some influence on the Fourth
Duma elections, the strike movement, the legal newspapers, the trade
unions, the insurance election campaign, and so on. Throughout those two
years, not one of these five groups abroad asserted itself in the slightest
degree in any of the activities of the mass working-class movement
in Russia just enumerated!  

 That is a fact that anybody can easily verify.  


 And that fact proves that we were right in calling Trotsky a
representative of the “worst remnants of factionalism”.  

 Although he claims to be non-factional, Trotsky is known to everybody
who is in the least familiar with the working-class movement in Russia as
the representative of “Trotsky’s faction”. Here we have
group-division, for we see two essential symptoms of it:
(1) nominal recognition of unity and
(2) group segregation in fact. Here there are remnants of group-division,
for there is no evidence whatever of any real connection with the mass
working-class movement in Russia.  

 And lastly, it is the worst form of group-division, for there is
no ideological and political definiteness. It cannot be denied
that this definiteness is characteristic of both the Pravdists (even our
determined opponent L. Martov admits that we stand “solid and
disciplined” around universally known formal decisions on all questions)
and the liquidators (they, or at all events the most prominent of them,
have very definite features, namely, liberal, not Marxist).  

 It cannot be denied that some of the groups which, like Trotsky’s,
really exist exclusively from the Vienna-Paris, but by no means from the
Russian, point of view, possess a degree of definiteness. For example, the
Machist theories of the Machist Vperyod group are
definite; the emphatic repudiation of these theories and defence of
Marxism, in addition to the theoretical condemnation of liquidationism, by
the “pro-Party Mensheviks”, are definite.  

 Trotsky, however, possesses no ideological and political definiteness,
for his patent for “non-factionalism”, as we shall soon see in greater
detail, is merely a patent to flit freely to and fro, from one
group to another.  

 To sum up: 

1)
 Trotsky does not explain, nor does he understand, the historical
significance of the ideological disagreements among the various
Marxist trends and groups, although these disagreements run through the
twenty years’ history of Social Democracy and concern the fundamental
questions of the present day (as we shall show later on); 

2)
 Trotsky fails to understand that the main specific features of
group-division are nominal recognition of unity and actual
disunity; 


3)
 Under cover of “non-factionalism” Trotsky is championing the interests of
a group abroad which particularly lacks definite principles, and has no
basis in the working-class movement in Russia.  

 All that glitters is not gold. There is much glitter and sound in
Trotsky’s phrases, but they are meaningless.  
II. THE SPLIT

“Although there is no group-division, i. e., nominal recognition of
unity, but actual disunity, among you, Pravdists, there is something worse,
namely, splitting tactics,” we are told. This is exactly what Trotsky
says. Unable to think out his ideas or to get his arguments to hang
together, he rants against group-division at one moment, and at the next
shouts: “Splitting tactics are winning one suicidal victory after
another”. (No. 1, p. 6.)  

 This statement can have only one mending: “The Pravdists are
winning one victory after another” (this is an objective, verifiable fact,
established by a study of the mass working-class movement in Russia during,
say, 1912 and 1913), but I, Trotsky, denounce the Pravdists
(1) as splitters, and
(2) as suicidal politicians.  

 Let us examine this.  

 First of all we must express our thanks to Trotsky. Not long ago (from
August 1912 to February 1914) he was at one with F. Dan, who, as is well
known, threatened to “kill” anti-liquidationism, and called upon
others to do so. At present Trotsky does not threaten to “kill” our trend
(and our Party—don’t be angry, Citizen Trotsky, this is true!), he only
prophesies that it will kill itself!  

 This is much milder, isn’t it? It is almost “non-factional”, isn’t
it?  

 But joking apart (although joking is the only way of retorting mildly
to Trotsky’s insufferable phrase-mongering).  

“Suicide” is a mere empty phrase, mere “Trotskyism”.  

 Splitting tactics are a grave political accusation. This accusation is
repeated against us in a thousand different keys by the liquidators and by
all the groups enumerated above, who, from the point of view of Paris and
Vienna, actually exist.  


 And all of them repeat this grave political accusation in an amazingly
frivolous way. Look at Trotsky. He admitted that “splitting tactics are
winning [read: the Pravdists are winning] one suicidal victory after
another”. To this he adds: 


   “Numerouss advanced workers, in a state of utter
   political bewilderment, themselves often become active agents of a
   split.”  (No. 1, p. 6.)  


 Are not these words a glaring example of irresponsibility on this
question?  

 You accuse us of being splitters when all that we see in front of us in
the arena of the working-class movement in Russia is liquidationism. So you
think that our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong? Indeed,
all the groups abroad that we enumerated above, no matter how much
they may differ from each other, are agreed that our attitude towards
liquidationism is wrong, that it is the attitude of “splitters”. This,
too, reveals the similarity (and fairly close political kinship) between
all these groups and the liquidators.  

 If our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong in theory, in
principle, then Trotsky should say so straightforwardly, and state
definitely, without equivocation, why he thinks it is wrong. But
Trotsky has been evading this extremely important point for years.


 If our attitude towards liquidationism has been proved wrong in
practice, by the experience of the movement, then this experience should be
analysed; but Trotsky fails to do this either. “Numerous advanced
workers,” he admits, “become active agents of a split” (read:
active agents of the Pravdist line, tactics, system and organisation).


 What is the cause of the deplorable fact, which, as Trotsky admits, is
confirmed by experience, that the advanced workers, the
numerous advanced workers at that, stand for Pravda?


 It is the “utter political bewilderment” of these advanced workers,
answers Trotsky.  

 Needless to say, this explanation is highly flattering to Trotsky, to
all five groups abroad, and to the liquidators. Trotsky is very fond of
using, with the learned air of the expert, pompous and high-sounding
phrases to explain

 

historical phenomena in a way that is flattering to Trotsky. Since
“numerous advanced workers” become “active agents” of a political and
Party line which does not conform to Trotsky’s line, Trotsky settles the
question unhesitatingly, out of hand: these advanced workers are “in a
state of utter political bewilderment”, whereas he, Trotsky, is evidently
“in a state” of political firmness and clarity, and keeps to the right
line!... And this very same Trotsky, beating his breast, fulminates against
factionalism, parochialism, and the efforts of intellectuals to impose
their will on the workers!  

 Reading things like these, one cannot help asking oneself:
is it from a lunatic asylum that such voices come?  

 The Party put the question of liquidationism, and of condemning it,
before the “advanced workers” as far back as 1908, while the question of
“splitting” away from a very definite group of liquidators (namely, the
Nasha Zarya group), i. e., that the only way to build up the Party
was without this group and in opposition to it—this question was
raised in January 1912, over two years ago. The overwhelming majority of
the advanced workers declared in favour of supporting the
“January (1912) line”. Trotsky himself admits this fact when he talks
about “victories” and about “numerous advanced workers”. But Trotsky
wriggles out of this simply by hurling abuse at these advanced
workers and calling them “splitters” and “politically bewildered”!


 From these facts sane people will draw a different conclusion. Where
the majority of the class-conscious workers have rallied around
precise and definite decisions, there we shall find unity of
opinion and action, there we shall find the Party spirit, and the Party.


 Where we see liquidators who have been “removed from office” by the
workers, or half a dozen groups outside Russia, who for two years have
produced no proof that they are connected with the mass working-class
movement in Russia, there, indeed, we shall find bewilderment and
splits. In now trying to persuade the workers not to carry out
the decisions of that “united whole”, which the Marxist Pravdists
recognise, Trotsky is trying to disrupt the movement and cause a
split.  


 These efforts are futile, but we must expose the arrogantly conceited
leaders of intellectualist groups, who, while causing splits themselves,
are shouting about others causing splits; who, after sustaining utter
defeat at the hands of the “advanced workers” for the past two years
or more, are with incredible insolence flouting the decisions and
the will of these advanced workers and saying that they are
“politically bewildered”. These are entirely the methods of
Nozdrev,[7] or of “Judas”
Golovlyov.[8] 

 In reply to these repeated outcries about a split and in fulfilment of
my duty as a publicist, I will not tire of repeating precise,
unrefuted and irrefutable figures. In the Second Duma, 47 per cent of the
deputies elected by the worker curia were Bolsheviks, in the Third Duma 50
per cent were Bolsheviks, and in the Fourth Duma 67 per cent.  

 There you have the majority of the “advanced workers”, there you have
the Party; there you have unity of opinion and action of the majority of
the class-conscious workers.  

 To this the liquidators say (see Bulkin, L. M., in Nasha Zarya
No. 3) that we base our arguments on the Stolypin curias. This is a foolish
and unscrupulous argument. The Germans measure their successes by the
results of elections conducted under the Bismarckian electoral law, which
excludes women. Only people bereft of their senses would reproach the
German Marxists for measuring their successes under the existing
electoral law, without in the least justifying its reactionary
restrictions.  

 And we, too, without justifying curias, or the curia system, measured
our successes under the existing electoral law. There were curias
in all three (Second, Third and Fourth) Duma elections; and within
the worker curia, within the ranks of Social-Democracy, there was
a complete swing against the liquidators. Those who do not wish to
deceive themselves and others must admit this objective fact, namely, the
victory of working-class unity over the liquidators.  

 The other argument is just as “clever”: “Mensheviks and liquidators
voted for (or took part in the election of) such and-such a Bolshevik.”
Splendid! But does not the same thing apply to the 53 per cent
non-Bolshevik deputies re turned to the Second Duma, and to the 50 per cent
returned

 

to the Third Duma, and to the 33 per cent returned to the Fourth Duma?


 If, instead of the figures on the deputies elected, we could obtain the
figures on the electors, or workers’ delegates, etc., we would gladly quote
them. But these more detailed figures are not available, and
consequently the “disputants” are simply throwing dust in people’s eyes.


 But what about the figures of the workers’ groups that assisted the
newspapers of the different trends? During two years (1912 and
1913), 2,801 groups assisted Pravda, and 750 assisted
    Luch.[1]

These figures are verifiable and nobody has attempted to disprove them.


 Where is the unity of action and will of the majority of the
“advanced workers”, and where is the flouting of the will of the
majority?  

 Trotsky’s “non-factionalism” is, actually, splitting tactics, in that
it shamelessly flouts the will of the majority of the workers.  
III. THE BREAK-UP OF THE AUGUST BLOC

 But there is still another method, and a very important one, of
verifying the correctness and truthfulness of Trotsky’s accusations about
splitting tactics.  

 You consider that it is the “Leninists” who are splitters? Very well,
let us assume that you are right.  

 But if you are, why have not all the other sections and groups proved
that unity is possible with the liquidators without the
“Leninists”, and against the “splitters”?... If we are
splitters, why have not you, uniters, united among yourselves, and with the
liquidators? Had you done that you would have proved to the workers by
deeds that unity is possible and beneficial!...  

 Let us go over the chronology of events.  

 In January 1912, the “Leninist” “splitters” declared that they were
a Party without and against the liquidators.  

 In March 1912, all the groups and “factions”: liquidators,
Trotskyists, Vperyodists, “pro-Party Bolsheviks” and “pro-Party

 

Mensheviks”, in their Russian news sheets and in the columns of the German
Social-Democratic newspaper Vorw\"arts, united against these
“splitters”. All of them unanimously, in chorus, in unison and in one
voice vilified us and called us “usurpers”, “mystifiers”, and other no
less affectionate and tender names.  

 Very well, gentlemen! But what could have been easier for you than to
unite against the “usurpers” and to set the “advanced workers”
an example of unity? Do you mean to say that if the advanced
workers had seen, on the one hand, the unity of all against the usurpers,
the unity of liquidators and non-liquidators, and on the other,
isolated “usurpers”, “splitters”, and so forth; they would not
have supported the former?  

 If disagreements are only invented, or exaggerated, and so forth, by
the “Leninists”, and if unity between the liquidators, Plekhanovites,
Vperyodists, Trotskyists, and so forth, is really possible, why
have you not proved this during the past two years by your own
example?  

 In August 1912, a conference of “uniters” was
convened. Disunity started at once: the Plekhanovites refused to
attend at all; the Vperyodists attended, but walked out after protesting
and exposing the fictitious character of the whole business.  

 The liquidators, the Letts, the Trotskyists (Trotsky and Semkovsky),
the Caucasians, and the Seven “united”. But did they? We stated at the
time that they did not, that this was merely a screen to cover up
liquidationism. Have the events disproved our statement?  

 Exactly eighteen months later, in February 1914, we found: 

1.
 that the Seven was breaking up. Buryanov had left them.  

2.
 that in the remaining new “Six”, Chkheidze and Tulyakov, or somebody
else, could not see eye to eye on the reply to be made to Plekhanov. They
stated in the press that they would reply to him, but they could
not.  

3.
 that Trotsky, who for many months had practically vanished from the columns
of Luck, had broken away, and had started “his own”
journal, Borba. By calling this journal “non-factional”, Trotsky
clearly (clearly to those who

 

are at all familiar with the subject) intimates that in his, Trotsky’s,
opinion, Nasha Zarya and Luch had proved to be
“factional”, i. e., poor uniters.  

 If you are a uniter, my dear Trotsky, if you say that it is possible to
unite with the liquidators, if you and they stand by the “fundamental
ideas formulated in August 1912” (Borba No. 1, p. 43, Editorial
Note), why did not you yourself unite with the liquidators in
Nasha Zarya and Luch?  

 When, before Trotsky’s journal appeared, Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta published some scathing comment stating that the physiognomy of
this journal was “unclear” and that there had been “quite a good deal of
talk in Marxist circles” about this journal, Put Pravdy
       (No. 37)[2]

was naturally obliged to expose this falsehood. It said: “There has been
talk in Marxist circles” about a secret memorandum written by Trotsky
against the Luch group; Trotsky’s physiognomy and his
breakaway from the August bloc were perfectly “clear”.  

4.
 An, the well-known leader of the Caucasian liquidators, who had attacked
L. Sedov (for which he was given a public wigging by F. Dan and Co.), now
appeared in Borba. It remains “unclear” whether the Caucasians
now desire to go with Trotsky or with Dan.  

5.
 The Lettish Marxists, who were the only real organisation in the “August
bloc”, had formally withdrawn from it, stating (in 1914)
in the resolution of their last Congress that: 


   “the attempt on the part of the conciliators to
   unite at all costs with the liquidators (the August Conference of 1912)
   proved fruitless, and the uniters themselves became ideologically and
   politically dependent upon the liquidators.”  


 This statement was made,after eighteen months’ experience, by an
organisation which had itself been neutral and had not
desired to establish connection with either of the two
centres. This decision of neutrals should carry all the more
weight with Trotsky!  

 Enough, is it not?  

 Those who accused us of being splitters, of being unwilling or unable
to get on with the liquidators, were themselves
 

unable to get on with them. The August bloc proved to be a fiction and
broke up.  

 By concealing this break-up from his readers, Trotsky is deceiving
them.  

 The experience of our opponents has proved that we are right, has
proved that the liquidators cannot be co-operated with.  
IV. A CONCILIATOR’S ADVICE TO THE “SEVEN”

 The editorial article in issue No. 1 of Borba entitled “The
Split in the Duma Group” contains advice from a conciliator to the seven
pro-liquidator (or inclining towards liquidationism) members of the
Duma. The gist of this advice is contained in the following words: 


   “first of all consult the Six whenever it is necessary
   to reach an agreement with other groups....” (P. 29.)  


 This is the wise counsel which, among other things, is evidently the
cause of Trotsky’s disagreement with the liquidators of Luch. This
is the opinion the Pravdists have held ever since the outbreak of the
conflict between the two groups in the Duma, ever since the resolution of
the Summer (1913) Conference was adopted. The Russian Social-Democratic
Labour group in the Duma has reiterated in the press, even after
the split, that it continues to adhere to this position, in spite of the
repeated refusals of the Seven.  

 From the very outset, since the time the resolution of the Summer
Conference was adopted, we have been, and still are, of the opinion that
agreements on questions concerning activities in the Duma
are desirable and possible; if such agreements have been repeatedly arrived
at with the petty-bourgeois peasant democrats (Trudoviks), they are all the
more possible and necessary with the petty-bourgeois, liberal-labour
politicians.  

 We must not exaggerate disagreements, but we must face the facts: the
Seven are men, leaning towards liquidationism, who yesterday entirely
followed the lead of Dan, and whose eyes today are travelling longingly
from Dan to Trotsky and back again. The liquidators are a group of
legalists who have broken away from the Party and are pursuing a liberal-

 

labour policy. Since they repudiate the “underground”, there can be no
question of unity with them in matters concerning Party organisation and
the working-class movement. Who ever thinks differently is badly mistaken
and fails to take into account the profound nature of the changes that have
taken place since 1908.  

 But agreements on certain questions with this group, which
stands outside or on the fringe of the Party, are, of course, permissible:
we must always compel this group, too, like the Trudoviks, to
choose between the workers’ (Pravdist) policy and the liberal policy. For
example, on the question of fighting for freedom of the press the
liquidators clearly revealed, vacillation between the liberal formulation
of the question, which repudiated, or overlooked, the illegal press, and
the opposite policy, that of the workers.  

 Within the scope of a Duma policy in which the most important
extra-Duma issues are not directly raised, agreements with the
seven liberal-labour deputies are possible and desirable. On this point
Trotsky has shifted his ground from that of the liquidators
to that of the Party Summer (1913) Conference.  

 It should not be forgotten, however, that to a group standing outside
the Party, agreement means something entirely different from what Party
people usually understand by the term. By “agreement” in the Duma,
non-Party people mean “drawing up a tactical resolution, or
line”. To Party people agreement is an attempt to enlist others
in the work of carrying out the Party line.  

 For example, the Trudoviks have no party. By agreement they understand
the “voluntary”, so to speak, “drawing up” of a line, today with the
Cadets, tomorrow with the Social-Democrats. We, however, understand
something entirely different by agreement with the Trudoviks. We have Party
decisions on all the important questions of tactics, and we shall never
depart from these decisions; by agreement with the Trudoviks we mean
winning them over to our side, convincing them that we
are right, and not rejecting joint action against the Black
Hundreds and against the liberals.  

 How far Trotsky has forgotten (not for nothing has he associated with
the liquidators) this elementary difference

 

between the Party and non-Party point of view on agreements, is shown by
the following argument of his: 


   “The representatives of the International must bring
   together the two sections of our divided parliamentary group and jointly
   with them ascertain the points of agreement and points of
   disagreement.... A detailed tactical resolution formulating the principles
   of parliamentary tactics may he drawn up....”  (No. 1, pp. 29—30.)  


 Here you have a characteristic and typical example of the
liquidationist presentation of the question! Trotsky’s journal forgets
about the Party; such a trifle is hardly worth remembering!  

 When different parties in Europe (Trotsky is fond of inappropriately
talking about Europeanism) come to an agreement or unite, what they do is
this: their respective representatives meet and first of all ascertain the
points of disagreement (precisely what the International proposed in
relation to Russia, without including in the resolution Kautsky’s
ill-considered statement that “the old Party no longer
exists”[9]). Having ascertained the points of disagreement, the
representatives decide what decisions (resolutions, conditions,
etc.) on questions of tactics, organisation, etc., should be submitted
to the congresses of the two parties. If they succeed in drafting
unanimous decisions, the congresses decide whether to adopt them or not. If
differing proposals are made, they too are submitted for final
decision to the congresses of the two parties.  

 What appeals to the liquidators and Trotsky is only the
European models of opportunism, but certainly not the models of
European partisanship.  

“A detailed tactical resolution” will be drawn up by the members of
the Duma! This example should serve the Russian “advanced workers”, with
whom Trotsky has good reason to be so displeased, as a striking
illustration of the lengths to which the groups in Vienna and Paris—who
persuaded even Kautsky that there was “no Party” in Russia—go in their
ludicrous project-mongering. But if it is some times possible to fool
foreigners on this score, the Russian “advanced workers” (at the risk of
provoking the terrible Trotsky to another outburst of displeasure) will
laugh in the faces of these project-mongers.  


“Detailed tactical resolutions,” they will tell them, “are drawn up
among us (we do not know how it is done among you lion-Party people) by
Party congresses and conferences, for example, those of 1907, 1908, 1910,
1912 and 1913. We shall gladly acquaint uninformed foreigners, as well as
forgetful Russians, with our Party decisions, and still more gladly ask the
representatives of the Seven, or the August bloc members, or Left-wingers
or anybody else, to acquaint us with the resolutions of their congresses,
or conferences, and to bring up at their next congress the definite
question of the attitude they should adopt towards our resolutions, or
towards the resolution of the neutral Lettish Congress of 1914, etc.”


 This is what the “advanced workers” of Russia will say to the various
project-mongers, and this has already been said iii the Marxist
press, for example, by the organised Marxists of St. Petersburg. Trotsky
chooses to ignore these published terms for the liquidators? So much the
worse for Trotsky. It is our duty to warn our readers how ridiculous that
“unity” (the August type of “unity”?) project-mongering is which
refuses to reckon with the will of the majority of the class-conscious
workers of Russia.  
V. TROTSKY’S LIQUIDATIONIST VIEWS

 As to the substance of his own views, Trotsky contrived to say as
little as possible in his new journal. Put Pravdy (No. 37) has
already commented on the fact that Trotsky has not said a word either on
the question of the “underground” or on the slogan of working for a legal
party,
 etc.[3]

That, among other things, is why we say that when attempts are made to form
a separate organisation which is to have no ideological and
political physiognomy, it is the worst form of factionalism.  

 Although Trotsky has refrained from openly expounding his views, quite
a number of passages in his journal show what kind of ideas he has been
trying to smuggle in.  

 In the very first editorial article in the first issue of his journal,
we read the following: 



   “The pre-revolutionary Social-Democratic Party in our
   country was a workers’ party only in ideas and aims. Actually, it
   was an organisation of the Marxist intelligentsia, which led the awakening
   working class.” (5.)  


 This is the old liberal and liquidationist tune, which is really the
prelude to the repudiation of the Party. It is based on a
distortion of the historical facts. The strikes of 1895—96 had already
given rise to a mass working-class movement, which both in ideas
and organisation was linked with the Social-Democratic movement. And in
these strikes, in this economic and non-economic agitation, the
“intelligentsia led the working class”!?  

 Or take the following exact statistics of political offences in the
period 1901—03 compared with the preceding period.  


Occupations of participants in the emancipation movement prosecuted for political offences (per cent)


Period
Agriculture
Industry and commerce
Liberal professions and students
No definite occupation, and no occupation




1884—90 
7.1
15.1
53.3
19.9


1901—03 
9.0
46.1
28.7
8.0




 We see that in the eighties, when there was as yet no Social-Democratic
Party in Russia, and when the movement was “Narodnik”, the intelligentsia
predominated, accounting for over half the participants.  

 But the picture underwent a complete change in 1901—03, when a
Social-Democratic Party already existed, and when the old Iskra
was conducting its work. The intelligentsia were now a minority
among the participants of the movement; the workers (“industry
and commerce”) were far more numerous than the intelligentsia, and the
workers and peasants together constituted more than half the total.  

 It was precisely in the conflict of trends within the Marxist movement
that the petty-bourgeois intellectualist wing of the
Social-Democracy made itself felt, beginning with Economism (1895—1903)
and continuing with Menshevism (1903—1908) and liquidationism
(1908—1914). Trotsky

 

repeats the liquidationist slander against the Party and is afraid to
mention the history of the twenty years’ conflict of trends within the
Party.  

 Here is another example.  


   “In its attitude towards parliamentarism, Russian
   Social-Democracy passed through the same three stages ... [as in other
   countries] ...  first ‘boycottism’ ... then the acceptance in principle of
   parliamentary tactics, but ... [that magnificent “but”, the “but” which
   Shchedrin translated as: The ears never grow higher than the forehead,

never![4]]...

   for purely agitational purposes ... and lastly, the presentation from the
   Duma rostrum ... of current demands....”  (No. 1, p. 34.)  


 This, too, is a liquidationist distortion of history. The distinction
between the second and third stages was invent ed in order to smuggle in a
defence of reformism and opportunism. Boycottism as a stage in “the
attitude of Social-Democracy towards parliamentarism” never existed
either in Europe (where anarchism has existed and continues to
exist) or in Russia, where the boycott of the Bulygin Duma, for example,
applied only to a definite institution, was never linked
with “parliamentarism”, and was engendered by the peculiar nature of the
struggle between liberalism and Marxism for the continuation of the
onslaught. Trotsky does not breathe a word, about the way this struggle
affected the conflict between the two trends in Marxism!  

 When dealing with history, one must explain concrete questions and the
class roots of the different trends; anybody who wants to make a Marxist
study of the struggle of classes and trends over the question of
participation in the Bulygin Duma, will see therein the roots of the
liberal-labour policy. But Trotsky “deals with” history only in order to
evade concrete questions and to invent a justification,
or a semblance of justification, for the present-day opportunists!  


   “Actually, all trends,” he writes, “employ the same
   methods of struggle and organisation.” “The outcries about the liberal
   danger in our working-class movement are simply a crude and sectarian
   travesty of reality.” (No. 1, pp. 5 and 35.)  


 This is a very clear and very vehement, defence of the liquidators. But
we will take the liberty of quoting at least

 

one small fact, one of the very latest. Trotsky merely slings words about;
we should like the workers themselves to ponder over the facts.  

 It is a fact that Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta for March 13
wrote the following: 


   “Instead of emphasising the definite and concrete
   task that confronts the working class, viz., to compel the Duma to throw
   out the bill [on the press], a vague formula is
   proposed of fighting for the ‘uncurtailed slogans’, and at the same time
   the illegal press is widely advertised, which can only lead to the
   relaxation of the workers’ struggle for their legal press.”  


 This is a clear, precise and documentary defence of the liquidationist
policy and a criticism of the Pravda policy. Well, will any
literate person say that both trends employ “the same methods of struggle
and organisation” on this question? Will any literate person say that the
liquidators are not pursuing a liberal-labour policy on
this question, that the liberal menace to the working-class movement is
purely imaginary?  

 The reason why Trotsky avoids facts and concrete references is because
they relentlessly refute all his angry outcries and pompous phrases. It is
very easy, of course, to strike an attitude and say: “a crude and
sectarian travesty”. Or to add a still more stinging and pompous
catch-phrase, such as “emancipation from conservative factionalism”.


 But is this not very cheap? Is not this weapon borrowed from the
arsenal of the period when Trotsky posed in all his splendour before
audiences of high-school boys?  

 Nevertheless, the “advanced workers”, with whom Trotsky is so angry,
would like to be told plainly and clearly:
Do you or do you not approve of the “method of struggle and organisation”
that is definitely expressed in the above-quoted appraisal of a definite
political campaign? If you do, then you are pursuing a liberal-labour
policy, betraying Marxism and the Party; to talk of “peace” or of
“unity” with such a policy, with groups which pursue
such a policy, means deceiving yourself and others.  

 If not, then say so plainly. Phrases will not astonish, satisfy or
intimidate the present-day workers.  

 Incidentally, the policy advocated by the liquidators in the
above-quoted passage is a foolish one even from the

 

liberal point of view, for the passage of a bill in the Duma depends on
“Zemstvo-Octobrists” of the type of Bennigsen, who has already shown his
hand in the committee.  
 *     *  * 

 The old participants in the Marxist movement in Russia know Trotsky
very well, and there is no need to discuss him for their benefit. But the
younger generation of workers do not know him, and it is therefore
necessary to discuss him, for he is typical of all the five groups abroad,
which, in fact, are also vacillating between the liquidators and the Party.


 In the days of the old Iskra (1901—03), these waverers, who
flitted from the Economists to the Iskrists and back again, were dubbed
“Tushino turncoats” (the name given in the Troublous Times in Rus to
fighting men who went over from one camp to
another[10]).  

 When we speak of liquidationism we speak of a definite ideological
trend, which grew up in the course of many years, stems from Menshevism and
Economism in the twenty years’ history of Marxism, and is connected with
the policy and ideology of a definite class—the liberal bourgeoisie.


 The only ground the “Tushino turncoats” have for claiming that they
stand above groups is that they “borrow” their ideas from one group one
day and from another the next day. Trotsky was an ardent Iskrist in
1901—03, and Ryazanov described his role at the Congress of 1903 as
“Lenin’s cudgel”. At the end of 1903, Trotsky was an ardent Menshevik,
i. e., he deserted from the Iskrists to the Economists. He said that
“between the old Iskra and the new lies a gulf”. In 1904—05, he
deserted the Mensheviks and occupied a vacillating position, now
co-operating with Martynov (the Economist), now proclaiming his absurdly
Left “permanent revolution” theory. In 1906—07, he approached the
Bolsheviks, and in the spring of 1907 he declared that he was in agreement
with Rosa Luxemburg.  

 In the period of disintegration, after long “non-factional”
vacillation, he again went to the right, and in August 1912, he entered
into a bloc with the liquidators. He has now

 

deserted them again, although in substance he reiterates their
shoddy ideas.  

 Such types are characteristic of the flotsam of past historical
formations, of the time when the mass, working-class movement in Russia was
still dormant, and when every group had “ample room” in which to pose as
a trend, group or faction, in short, as a “power”, negotiating
amalgamation with others.  

 The younger generation of workers should know exactly whom they are
dealing with, when individuals come before them with incredibly pretentious
claims, unwilling absolutely to reckon with either the Party
decisions, which since 1908 have defined and established our attitude
towards liquidationism, or with the experience of the present-day
working-class movement in Russia, which has actually brought about the
unity of the majority on the basis of full recognition of the
aforesaid decisions.

 Pro-Party Mensheviks—headed by Plekhanov, came out against
the liquidators during the period of reaction. While taking a Menshevik
stand, the Plekhanovites at the same time stood for the preservation and
strengthening of the illegal Party organisation and therefore stood for a
bloc with the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov broke the bloc with the Bolsheviks at
the end of 1911. Under the guise of fighting “factionalism” and the split
in the R.S.D.L.P. be attempted to reconcile the Bolsheviks with the

 At the December meeting of the International Socialist Bureau (held in
London on December 13—14, 1913) a resolution was adopt ed instructing the
Executive of the International Socialist Bureau to call a meeting of
representatives of “all factions of the labour movement in Russia,
including Russian Poland, who recognise the Party Programme or whose
programme corresponds with that of the Social-Democrats, for a mutual
exchange o opinions (Aussprache) on points of disagreement”. In
seconding this resolution, Kautsky, in his speech of December 14, stated
that the old Social-Democratic Party in Russia was dead. It had to be
re-established on the basis of the Russian workers’ urge for unity. In his
article “A Good Resolution and a Bad Speech”, Lenin examined this
resolution and called Kautsky’s speech monstrous. (See present edition,
Vol. 19, pp. 528—30.)

 The Troublous Times—a term used in pre-revolutionary Russian
historiography to denote the period of the peasant war and the struggle of
the Russian people against the Polish and Swedish intervention in the early
seventeenth century.  

 In 1608 the Polish troops under Pseudo-Dmitry II, a henchman of the
Polish landed gentry who posed as the younger son of the Russian tsar Ivan
the Terrible, invaded Russia, and reached the outskirts of Moscow, where
they encamped in Tushino. A government headed by Pseudo-Dmitry was formed
in Tushino in opposition to the government of Moscow. Some of the Russian
nobles and boyar aristocracy deserted one camp for another in an effort to
keep in with the winning side. These deserters were called “Tushino
turncoats”.

One cannot but welcome Mr. Drozdov’s initiative in raising,
in his pamphlet, an extremely interesting and important question. The
author has taken the figures of the daily wages (expressed in terms both of
money and of grain), the rye crop yield on private landlord fields during
1902–04, and the annual figures for the period 1905–10, and compared
these data for different parts of European Russia.  

The author found the biggest pay rises for 1905 in the south-western
region (a ten per cent rise compared with 1902–04). The average increase
for Russia was 1.2 per cent in 1905, and 12.5 per cent in 1906. From this
the author draws the conclusion that wages rose most in regions in which
agricultural capitalism is most developed, and the strike form of struggle
(as distinct from what is known as the “riot and wreck” form) is most
widespread. Strictly speaking, these figures are inadequate to support this
conclusion. For example, the second highest rise in wages occurred in 1905
in the Urals region (a rise of 9.68 per cent, as against 10.35 per cent in
the south-western region). If we take average wages for the whole
of the post-revolutionary period, i. e., 1905–10, we shall get an index
number of 110.3 (taking 1902–04 at 100) in the south-western region, and
121.7 in the Urals. The author, as it were, makes an “exception” for the
Urals, on the basis of my book The Development of Capitalism. But
in that book I made an exception for the Urals in studying workers’ mass
migration, not the level of wages in

       general.[1]

The author’s reference

    

to my book, therefore, is wrong. Nor can his reference to the very small
percentage of private landlord farming in the

Urals[2]

be regarded as satisfactory. The author should have taken the more detailed
gubernia figures and compared the rise in wages with the figures showing
the relative strength of the agrarian movement in general, and of
its strike form, “riot and wreck” form, and so on.  

On the whole, the money wages of agricultural labourers throughout
Russia rose most between 1905 and 1906. Taking the wages of
1902–04 at 100, the index number for 1905 and 1906 will be 101.2 and 112.5
respectively. The index numbers for the ensuing four years are: 114.2,
113.1, 118.4 and 119.6. It is clear that with the general rise in
money wages as a result of the revolution, we see the direct and
predominating influence of the struggle of 1905–06.  

Referring our readers to Mr. Drozdov’s excellent pamphlet for the
details, we shall observe here that the author has no grounds whatever for
describing as “manifestly impracticable” those demands of the peasants
which virtually amounted to “smoking out the landlords” (p. 30). Equally
groundless and unreasoned is his statement that in the “riot and wreck”
regions the “struggle was waged for equalised land tenure, and, in
general, for other equally petty-bourgeois, utopian demands”
(p. 38). Firstly, the peasants fought, not only for land tenure, but for
landownership (“smoking out”); secondly, they fought, not for equalised
tenure, hut for the transfer to them of the landed estates—that is
something entirely different. Thirdly, what was and remains utopian is the
subjective hopes (and “theories”) of the Narodniks in
the matter of “equality”, “socialisation”, “taking the land out of
commercial circulation”, and similar nonsense; but there was nothing
“utopian” in the petty-bourgeois masses “smoking out” the
feudalists. The author con fuses the objective historical significance of
the peasants’ struggle for land—a struggle that was progressive-bourgeois
and radical-bourgeois—with the subjective theories and hopes of the
Narodniks, which were, and still are, utopian

    

and reactionary. Such confusion is profoundly erroneous, undialectical and
unhistorical.  

Comparing the averages for 1891–1900 with those for 1901–10, the
author draws the general conclusion that daily money wages all
over Russia rose by 25.5 per cent, while real wages, expressed in
terms of grain, rose only by 3.9 per cent, i. e., underwent hardly
any change at all. We would remark that, arranged to reflect money-wage
rises during the above-mentioned decades, the order of the various regions
is as follows: Lithuania 39 per cent, the Volga area 33 per cent, the Urals
30 per cent, the Ukraine 28 per cent, the central agricultural region 26
per cent, etc.  

In conclusion, the author compares the rise in agricultural labourers’
wages during the past two decades (1891–1900 and 1901–10) with the rise
in ground-rent. It appears that for the whole of Russia, average wages rose
from 52.2 kopeks per day to 66.3 kopeks, i.e., by 27 per cent. However, the
price of land—it is well known that the price of land is capitalised
rent—rose from 69.1 rubles per dessiatine to 132.4 rubles, that
is, by 91 per cent. In other words, wages rose by one-fourth, while
ground-rent almost doubled!  

“And this circumstance,” the author rightly concludes, “signifies
only one thing, namely: the deterioration in the relative standard of
living of the agricultural labourers in Russia, with a simultaneous
relative rise in the standard of living of the landowning class.... The
social gulf between the landlord class and the class of wage-labourers is
steadily widening.”

In this connection the author puts the northern region on a par with
the Urals. But in the northern region, wages in 1905 dropped by six
per cent, and in 1906 showed only an eight per cent rise.  —Lenin

In Put Pravdy No. 63, the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group made a last attempt to ascertain whether the
six deputies (the Chkheidze group) now intend—after the vast majority of
the class-conscious workers have condemned their alliance with the
liquidators—to take steps towards an agreement with the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group in the
Duma.[1] 

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group asked the
“Social-Democratic group” whether it now intended unreservedly
to recognise the decisions of the entire Marxist body of 1903 (the
Programme) and of 1908–10 (condemnation of the liquidators). Why the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour group put this question in the forefront,
is clear. The decisions of 1903, 1908 and 1910 were adopted prior to
any splits between the Marxists and the liquidators. These decisions
are the banner of all Marxists. If any agreement between the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group and the “Social-Democratic group” is at
all possible, then it is of course possible only on the basis of the
unqualified recognition of these decisions, which were adopted before the
split.  

In issue No. 2 of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, the Chkheidze group
published an “Open Reply” in which clarity is at last achieved and which
therefore deserves the most serious attention from all workers who
seriously try to understand the causes of the disagreements, and want
genuine unity.  
1. THE PROGRAMME AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION

At the Marxist Congress which drew up the Programme (1903),
the Bundists (Jewish liquidators) proposed that a demand be included in the
Programme for “the establishment

    

of institutions that will guarantee them complete freedom of cultural
development”. This was opposed by the present-day liquidators Martynov,
Martov and Koltsov. They argued, quite correctly, that this demand ran
counter to the international principles of Social-Democracy. This demand
was rejected by all votes against the vote of the Bundists (see
the Minutes).  

Marxists assert that the “establishment of institutions” is the same
“cultural-national autonomy”, which Social-Democracy rejects.  

In their “Open Reply” the six deputies assert the contrary. They say:
we advocated the “establishment of institutions”, but we did not advocate
cultural-national autonomy.  

Very well, we say in reply; let us assume for a moment that
the two are not the same. But the Congress also rejected the
“establishment of institutions”. You know that perfectly
well. You know that, to please the nationalists, you have retreated
from the Programme. It was for this violation of the Programme that
the Bundists, whose proposals the Congress rejected, complimented you.


After the Social-Democratic group made its declaration at the opening
of the Fourth Duma, they wrote: 


   “It may be pointed out that the formula of the
   Social-Democrats [i. e., liquidators] lacked clarity. That is quite
   true. But the important thing is that the workers’ deputies
   [i. e., Chkheidze’s supporters] abandoned the rigid point of view
   on which the official theory on the national question is based.”
   (Zeit No. 9, editorial, column 3.)  


The “official theory” is nothing more nor less than the
Programme. The Bundists compliment Chkheidze and his friends for
infringing the Programme. The Russian Social-Democratic Labour
group asked: Is the “Social-Democratic group” willing to retract this
infringement of the Programme?  

The reply was clear: “This formula [i. e., establishment of
institutions] contains absolutely nothing that the Social-Democratic group
should retract” (cf. “Open Reply”).  

We refuse to retract this infringement of the Programme—such was the
reply of the “Social-Democratic group”.  
    

2. THE DECISION OF 1908

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group next asked the
“Social-Democratic group” whether it was willing to recognise the 1908
decision of the Marxists, which was recently endorsed also by the Lettish
conciliators.  

This decision reads as follows: 


   “Liquidationism is an attempt on the part of a certain
   section of the Party intelligentsia to liquidate [i. e., to dissolve,
   destroy, abolish, put an end to] the existing Party organisation, and to
   substitute for it an amorphous federation acting within legal hounds
   [i. e., within the law, in open existence] at all costs, even at the cost
   of openly abandoning the programme, tactics and traditions [i. e., the
   preceding experience] of the Party.”  


And this decision goes on to say that “it is necessary to wage a
most relentless ideological and organisational struggle against these
liquidationist attempts” (cf. Report,
p. 38).[2] 

This decision was adopted by the united Marxist body in the presence of
representatives of all groups, including the liquidators (Dan, Axelrod and
others), the Bundists, and so forth. It was adopted in December 1908,
before there were any splits.  

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group asked the Chkheidze group
whether it accepted this 1908 decision, which condemned
liquidationism.  

What did the Chkheidze group say in reply?  

Not a word! Not a sound! It treated the decision of 1908 as
though it did not exist. Incredible, but a fact. And this silence is more
eloquent than words. It reveals an incredibly arrogant disregard
for decisions. Decisions that are not to my liking are simply
non-existent—such are the ethics of the liquidationist deputies.  

The latter acted in the same way when it came to accepting deputy
Jagiello into the group. It was pointed out to them that the 1908 decision
rejected “unity” with Jagiello’s non-Social-Democratic party. But to this
they replied that in 1907, i. e., a year before this decision was adopted,
the Social-Democratic group in the Second Duma had accepted as members the
Lithuanian deputies who were unquestionably Social-Democrats. This means
openly mocking at decisions.  
    

3. THE 1910 DECISION

This decision reads as follows: 


   “The historical situation in the Social-Democratic
   movement in the period of bourgeois counter-revolution inevitably gives
   rise—as a manifestation of the bourgeois influence on the
   proletariat—on the one hand, to repudiation of the illegal
   Social-Democratic Party, belittling of its role and importance, and
   attempts to whittle down the programmatic and tactical tasks and the
   slogans of consistent Social-Democracy, etc., and on the other hand, to
   repudiation of Social-Democratic activities in the Duma and of the
   utilisation of legal possibilities, failure to understand the importance of
   either, inability to apply consistent Social-Democratic tactics to the
   specific historical conditions prevailing at the present time, etc.  

   “An inalienable element of Social-Democratic tactics
   under these conditions is the elimination of both these deviations by
   extending and intensifying Social-Democratic activities in all fields of
   the proletarian class struggle, and explanation of the dangers of these
   deviations.”  


This decision was adopted unanimously, prior to any splits, in
the presence of representatives of all groups. It condemns
liquidationism and otzovism.  

The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group asked the
“Social-Democratic group” whether it recognised that decision. The latter
replied: “The 1910 decisions do not even contain the word
liquidationism”.  

The “word” is not there! But whom did the entire Marxist
body have in mind when it condemned the “repudiation of the illegal
Social-Democratic Party, the belittling of its role and importance”? Whom
if not the liquidators?  

Lastly, we have a most authentic document, published three years ago
and refuted by nobody, a document emanating from all the “national”
Marxists (Letts, Bundists and Poles), and from Trotsky (the liquidators
cannot imagine better witnesses). This document plainly states that “it
would in fact be desirable to call the trend mentioned in the resolution
liquidationism, which must be combated....”  

How can the deputies have the effrontery to mislead the workers in this
unblushing manner?  

The “Social-Democratic group” refuses to recognise the 1910
decisions! Instead, it declares that it is in “complete agreement” with
the liquidationist Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta.  
 

The 1903, 1908 and 1910 decisions of the entire Marxist body do not
exist for the liquidationist deputies. For them only the “decisions” of
the liquidationist newspaper exist.  
4. “TRENDS”

While flouting direct decisions and ignoring the will of the workers,
the “Social-Democratic group” dilates on the usefulness of all “trends
of Marxism”.  

Marxists all over the world take the workers’ organisations as
their basis. In our country, however, some people want to take elusive
“trends” as their basis. In Germany and in fact all over the world, the
Social-Democrats unite the workers, their local cells,
organisations and groups. In our country, some people want to unite
“trends”.  

“All trends among the Marxists”! But among the liquidators alone
there are at least two “trends”: Borba and Nasha Rabochaya
Gazeta, disputing with each other as to which of them is the best
custodian of the “August precepts”.  

The idea of uniting ten “trends”, all of them isolated from the
masses, is hopeless. The idea of uniting all workers willing to
build up the entire Marxist body is a great cause, which is being
accomplished before our very eyes with the ardent support of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group.  
 *     *  * 

Clarity has been achieved. The overwhelming majority of the workers
(see the returns of the insurance elections, group collections and the
correspondence between the workers’ groups and the two groups in the Duma)
have declared in favour of the Marxists, in favour of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group, and against the liquidators. The August
bloc has broken down; the Lettish Social-Democrats and Buryanov have left
them, and the supporters of An and of Borba are leaving them; the
six deputies grouped around Chkheidze have joined the worst and
most liquidationist fragment of the August bloc.  

The workers must draw their own conclusions.  

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Put Pravdy No. 50, for March 30 (April 12), 1914 published the
resolution of the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish
Region concerning the split in the Social-Democratic group in the Fourth
Duma. The resolution stressed the need for unity of the Duma
Social-Democratic group on the basis of acceptance of the Programme and
Rules of the Party and the Party decisions. (See pp. 177–51 of this
volume.)  

In connection with this resolution of the Lettish Congress, the same
issue of Put Pravdy published an “Open Enquiry” to the
Menshevik’ deputies as to their attitude towards the principles advanced by
the Lettish workers. This enquiry of the Bolshevik newspaper was ignored by
the Mensheviks. Thereupon, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in
the Duma published an “Open Letter” in Put Pravdy No. 63 for
April 17, 1914 in which they demanded from the Mensheviks a clear and
definite reply to the question put to them.  

The “Open Letter” evoked an “Open Reply” by the Mensheviks, which
was published in Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, May 4 (17). This reply is
dealt with in the present article.

Lenin is quoting the resolution of the Fifth All-Russia Conference of
the R.S.D.L.P.—the “All-Russia Conference of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party. (In December 1908.)” It was published by

When Marxists say that certain groups, are adventurist,
they have in mind the very definite and specific social and historical
features of a phenomenon, one that every class-conscious worker should be
familiar with.  

The history of Russian Social-Democracy teems with tiny groups, which
sprang up for an hour, for several months, with no roots whatever among the
masses (and politics without the masses are adventurist politics), and with
no serious and stable principles. In a petty-bourgeois country, which is
passing through a historical period of bourgeois reconstruction, it is
inevitable that a motley assortment of intellectuals should join
the workers, and that these intellectuals should attempt to form all kinds
of groups, adventurist in character in the sense referred to above.  

Workers who do not wish to be fooled should subject every group to the
closest scrutiny and ascertain how serious its principles are, and what
roots it has in the masses. Put no faith in words; subject everything to
the closest scrutiny—such is the motto of the Marxist workers.  

Let us recall the struggle between Iskrism and Economism in
1895–1902. These were two trends of Social-Democratic thought. One of them
was proletarian and Marxist, which had stood the test of the three years’
campaign conducted by Iskra, and been tested by all advanced
workers, who recognised as their own the precisely and clearly formulated
decisions on Iskrist tactics and organisation. The other, Economism, was a
bourgeois, opportunist trend, which strove to subordinate the
workers to the liberals.  

Besides these two important trends, there were a host of small and
rootless groups (Svoboda,

Borba,[1] the group

    

that published the Berlin leaflets, and so forth). These have long been
forgotten. Though there were no few honest and conscientious
Social-Democrats in these groups, they proved adventurist in the
sense that they had no stable or serious principles, programme,
tactics, organisation, and no roots among the masses.  

It is thus, and only thus—by studying the history of the movement, by
pondering over the ideological significance of definite theories, and by
putting phrases to the test of facts—that serious people should appraise
present-day trends and groups.  

Only simpletons put faith in words.  

Pravdism is a trend which has given precise Marxist answers and
resolutions (of 1908, 1910, 1912 and 1913—in February and in the summer)
on all questions of tactics, organisation and programme. The continuity of
these decisions since the time of the old Iskra (1901–03), let
alone the London (1907) Congress, has been of the strictest. The
correctness of these decisions has been proved by the five or six years’
(1908–14) experience of all the advanced workers, who have accepted these
decisions as their own. Pravdism has united four-fifths of the
class-conscious workers of Russia (5,300 Social-Democratic workers’ groups
out of 6,700 in two-and-a-half years).  

Liquidationism is a trend with a history that goes back almost twenty
years, for it is the direct continuation of Economism (1895–1902) and the
offspring of Menshevism (1903–08). The liberal-bourgeois roots and the
liberal-bourgeois content of this trend have been recognised in official
decisions (1908 and 1910; small wonder that the liquidators are afraid even
to publish them in full!). The liquidators’ liberal ideas are all linked up
and of a piece:
down with the “underground”, down with the “pillars”, for an open
party, against the “strike craze”, against the higher forms of the
struggle, and so forth. In liberal-bourgeois “society” the liquidators
have long enjoyed the strong sympathy of the Cadets and of the non-Party
(and near-Party) intellectuals. Liquidationism is a serious trend, only not
a Marxist, not a proletarian trend, but a liberal-bourgeois one. Only
witless people can talk about “peace” with the liquidators.  
 

Now take the other groups which pose as “trends”. We shall enumerate
them:
1) the Vperyod group plus Alexinsky;
2) ditto plus Bogdanov;
3) ditto plus Voinov;
4) the Plekhanovites;
5) the “pro-Party Bolsheviks” (actually conciliators: Mark Sommer and his
crowd);
6) the Trotskyists (i. e., Trotsky even minus Semkovsky);
7) the “Caucasians” (i. e., An minus the Caucasus).  

We have enumerated the groups mentioned in the press. In
Russia and abroad they have stated that they want to be separate
“trends” and groups. We have tried to list all the Russian groups,
omitting the non-Russian.  

All these groups, without exception, represent sheer adventurism.  

“Why? Where is the proof?” the reader will ask.  

Proof is provided by the history of the last decade (1904–14), which
is most eventful and significant. During these ten years members of these
groups have displayed the most helpless, most pitiful, most ludicrous
vacillation on serious questions of tactics and organisation, and have
shown their utter inability to create trends with roots among the
masses.  

Take Plekhanov, the best of them. The services he rendered in the past
were immense. During the twenty years between 1883 and 1903 he wrote a
large number of splendid essays, especially those against the opportunists,
Machists and Narodniks.  

But since 1903 Plekhanov has been vacillating in the most ludicrous
manner on questions of tactics and organisation:
1) 1903, August—a Bolshevik;
2) 1903, November (Iskra No. 52)—in favour of peace with the
“opportunist” Mensheviks;
3) 1903, December—a Menshevik, and an ardent one;
4) 1905, spring—after the victory of the Bolsheviks—in favour of
“unity” between “brothers at strife”;
5) the end of 1905 till mid-1906—a Menshevik;
6) mid-1906—started, on and off, to move away from the Mensheviks, and in
London, in 1907, censured them (Cherevanin’s admission) for their
“organisational anarchism”;
7) 1908—a break with the liquidators;
8) 1914—a new turn towards the liquidators.
Plekhanov advocates “unity” with them, without being able to utter an
intelligible word to explain on what terms this unity is to be
achieved, why unity with Mr. Potresov

    

has become possible, and what guarantees there are that any terms agreed to
will be carried out.  

After a decade of such experience we can safely say that Plekhanov is
capable of producing ripples, but he has not produced, nor will he ever
produce, a “trend”.  

We quite understand the Pravdists, who willingly published Plekhanov’s
articles against the liquidators. They could not very well reject articles
which, in full accord with the decisions of 1908–10, were directed against
the liquidators. Now Plekhanov has begun to repeat—with the liquidators,
with Bogdanov and the rest—phrases about the unity of “all trends”. We
emphatically condemn this line, which should be relentlessly combated.


Nowhere in the world do the workers’ parties unite groups of
intellectuals and “trends”; they unite workers on the following
terms:
(1) recognition and application of definite Marxist decisions on questions
of tactics and organisation;
(2) submission of the minority of class-conscious workers to the majority.


This unity, on the basis of absolute repudiation of the opponents of
the “underground”, was achieved by the Pravdists in the course of
two-and-a-half years (1912–14) to the extent of four-fifths. Witless
people may abuse the Pravdists and call them factionalists, splitters, and
so forth, but these phrases and abuse will not wipe out the unity of the
workers....  

Plekhanov now threatens to destroy this unity of the majority. We
calmly and firmly say to the workers: put no faith in words. Put them to
the test of facts, and you will see that every step taken by every one of
the above-mentioned adventurist groups more and more glaringly reveals
their helpless and pitiful vacillation.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
The Svoboda (Freedom) group was founded by
Y. 0. Zelensky (Nadezhdin) in May 1901. It called itself the
“revolutionary-socialist” group, and published the journal
Svoboda in Switzerland (of which two issues appeared—No. 1 in
1901, and No. 2 in 1902). The group also published: “Eve of the
Revolution. A Review of Questions of Theory and Tactics
No. 1, a periodical Otkliki (Comments) No. 1, a programmatic
pamphlet The Revival of Revolutionism in Russia and others. The
Svoboda group preached the ideas of terrorism and Economism, acted
in concert with the St. Petersburg Economists against Iskra and
the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. The group ceased to exist in
1903.  

The Borba (Struggle) group was formed in Paris in the
summer of 1900 and consisted of D. B. Ryazanov, Y. M. Steklov, and
E. L. Gurevich. The name Borba was adopted by the group in
May 1901. In its publications the group distorted the revolutionary theory
of Marxism, which it interpreted in a doctrinaire and scholastic spirit,
and was opposed to Lenin’s organisational principles of Party building. In
view of its deviations from Social-Democratic views and tactics, its
disruptive activities and lack of contact with the Social-Democratic
organisations in Russia, the group was not allowed to attend the Second
Congress. By a decision of the Second Congress of the R. S. D. L. P. the
Borba group was dissolved.

What worker does not remember the noise the liquidators
raised when, in a special issue of our newspaper, we acquainted the reader
with the latest decisions of the Lettish Marxists and remarked that the
Letts had paid tribute to the spirit of compromise while at the same time
dealing a death blow at the liquidationist August
bloc.[1]


The liquidators have used every means in their power to challenge this
conclusion. All the resourcefulness of Martov, all the ... truthfulness of
Dan, all the wit and brilliant literary talent of Semkovsky and
Yonov—everything has been mobilised for this purpose. The liquidators
have been determined at all cost to “prove” that the Lettish Congress did
not condemn the liquidators, did not come out against the August bloc,, and
so on and so forth. In a word, “It’s not me, it’s not my horse, I’m not
the
      driver”.[2]


Now, after a lapse of only two or three months, the journal of the
liquidators themselves (Nasha Zarya No. 4) has published an
article by Mr. Weiss, the most “prominent” Lettish liquidator, who
fully confirms our own appraisal of events.  

Mr. Weiss is a most vigorous opponent of ours. He heaps harsh
“criticism” on the Russian “Leninists” and the Lettish
majority. However, he has the courage to openly admit defeat, while
promising to go on fighting for his liquidationist views. He does not shift
and shuffle; he does not, like Semkovsky, try to prove that white is black
and vice versa. One may sharply dispute with such an opponent,

    

but he nevertheless commands respect for not having recourse to the trivial
methods of the Semkovskys.  

Mr Weiss writes: 


   “The predominant tendency there [at the Congress] among
   the Lettish Marxists, by a majority of one, and, on some questions, a
   majority of two votes, was one of sympathy ... with the ‘Lenin circle’.”
   

   “The Fourth Congress of the Lettish Marxists is an
   attempt to revert to the old ... Bolshevik ideology.”  

   “The resolution on the Duma group was adopted
   unanimously. It was a big concession on the part of the minority
   of the Congress [that is, a concession to the “Leninists”].”  

   “The Lenin circle can count on the official support of
   the Letts”, and so on.  


The writer makes the reservation that “the minority succeeded somewhat
in marring Lenin’s triumph”. He calls (and rightly so!)  “curious” the
concessions made by the majority to the conciliators.  

But he clearly and unequivocally recognises the fact that the Congress
took an anti-liquidationist stand, and, on the main issue, took sides with
the Pravdists.  

It is the same old story. For two or three months the liquidators raise
a hullabaloo, only to admit afterwards that it was we who correctly
presented the facts in the first instance.  

To what lengths the liquidators sometimes go in their striving to
“explain” unpalatable Party decisions can be seen from the following. In
December 1908, as is known, the all-Russia conference of Marxists
rejected the proposal to amalgamate with Jagiello’s party (the
P.S.P.). This was done in the most emphatic form—by proceeding with the
agenda without debating the motion for amalgamation with the
non-Social-Democratic party of deputy Jagiello. At their Congress in 1914,
the Letts endorsed all the decisions adopted in 1908, thereby declaring
their refusal to have the non-Social-Democrat Jagiello admitted to the
Social-Democratic group. This decision is most unpalatable to the
liquidators.  

And yet in Zeit, the newspaper of the Jewish liquidators, we
find this decision “explained” in the following manner: 


   “What does proceeding with the agenda mean? It means
   that the meeting does not want to put the motion to the vote, does not want

    

   either to reject or adopt it. In such cases it calls the next business. The
   question of amalgamation with the Jagiello trend was simply left open [!]
   at the meeting of 1908.” (Zeit No. 17.)  


Is not such an “explanation” of Party decisions sheer... impudence?


When the liquidators’ proposal for amalgamation with the Jagiello trend
was rejected, F. Dan wrote at the time (in 1908) in his official press
report: 


   “At the proposal of the Polish delegation [the Polish
   Social-Democrats] the conference refused even to discuss our resolution and
   passed on to the next business. In this minor fact, circle intolerance and
   circle habits of thought have apparently reached their uttermost limit.”
   (F. Dan’s Report, p. 45.)  


F. Dan used this strong language because he knew that proceeding with
the agenda meant a flat rejection of the proposal for amalgamation
with Jagiello’s non-Social-Democratic party. And now this flat rejection is
“explained” to us as meaning that the question has been “left open”,
and that everyone is free to decide it in his own way! This is really the
last straw in the flouting of Marxist decisions.  

No amount of wriggling will help the liquidators. The Marxist line has
been endorsed by life itself. Events in the Lettish Social-Democratic
movement confirm this no less strikingly than the entire course of the
working-class movement throughout Russia does.

There is nothing more important to class-conscious workers
than to have an understanding of the significance of their
movement and a thorough knowledge of it. The only source of
strength of the working-class movement—and an invincible one at that—is
the class-consciousness of the workers and the broad scope of
their struggle, that is, the participation in it of the masses of
the wage-workers.  

The St. Petersburg Marxist press, which has been in existence for
years, publishes exclusive, excellent, indispensable and easily verifiable
material on the scope of the working-class movement and the various trends
predominating in it. Only those who wish to conceal the truth can ignore
this material, as the liberals and liquidators do.  

Complete figures concerning the collections made for the Pravdist
(Marxist) and liquidationist newspapers in St. Petersburg for the period
between January 1 and May 13, 1914, have been compiled by Comrade
V.A.T.[3] We publish his table below in full, and shall quote round
figures in the body of this article as occasion arises, so as not to burden
the reader with statistics.  

The following is Comrade V.A.T.’s table. (See pp. 364–65.) First of
all we shall deal with the figures showing the number of workers’
groups. These figures cover the whole period of existence of the Pravdist
and liquidationist newspapers. Number of workers’ groups:

The total number of groups is 7,095. Of course, there are groups which
made several collections, but separate data for these are not available.


We see that only one-fifth of the total number of workers’
groups are in sympathy with the liquidators. In two-and-a-half years,
Pravdism, Pravdist decisions and Pravdist tactics have united
four-fifths of Russia’s class-conscious workers. This fact of workers’
unity can well bear comparison with the phrases about “unity” uttered by
the various grouplets of intellectuals, the Vperyodists, Plekhanovites,
Trotskyists, etc., etc.  

Let us compare the figures for 1913 and 1914 (those for 1912 are not
comparable, because Pravda appeared in April, and Luch
five months later). We shall find that the number of Pravdist groups has
grown by 692, i. e., 31.7 per cent, whereas the liquidationist
groups have gone up by 10, i. e., 1.5 per cent. Hence, the
workers’ readiness to support the Pravdist newspapers has grown 20
times as last as their readiness to support the liquidationist
newspapers.  

Let us see how the workers in various parts of Russia are divided
according to trend:

     {

86
14


Moscow . . . . . . . .    
83
17


Provinces . . . . . . .

32




The inference is clear: the more politically developed the masses of
the workers are, and the higher their level of class-consciousness and
political activity, the higher is the number of Pravdists among
them. In St. Petersburg the liquidators have been almost completely
dislodged (fourteen out of a hundred); they still have a precarious hold in
the provinces (32 out of 100), where the masses are politically less
educated.  

It is highly instructive to note that figures from an entirely
different source, namely, those giving the number of workers’ delegates
elected during the Insurance Board elections, tally to a remarkable degree
with those of the workers’ groups. During the election of the Metropolitan
Insurance Board, 37 Pravdist and 7 liquidationist delegates were

    

elected, i. e., 84 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. Of the total
number of delegates elected, the Pravdists constituted 70 per cent (37 out
of 53), and at the election of the All-Russia Insurance Board they
obtained 47 out of 57, i. e., 82 per cent. The liquidators, non-party
people and Narodniks form a small minority of workers, who still remain
under bourgeois influence.  

To proceed. The following are interesting figures on the average
amounts collected by workers groups:

 Provinces . . . . . . .

The Pravdist groups show a natural, understandable and, so to speak,
normal tendency: the average contribution from the average workers’ group
rises with the increase in the average earnings of the working masses.


In the case of the liquidators, we see, apart from the spurt in the
Moscow groups (of which there are only 25 in all!), that the average
contributions from the provincial groups are higher than those
from the St. Petersburg groups! How are we to explain this odd phenomenon?


Only a more detailed analysis of the figures could provide a
satisfactory reply to this question, but that would be a laborious
task. Our conjecture is that the liquidators unite the minority of the
higher-paid workers in certain sections of industry. It has been observed
all over the world that such workers cling to liberal and opportunist
ideas. In St. Petersburg, the longest to put up with the liquidators were
the printing workers, and it was only during the last elections in their
Union, on April 27, 1914, that the Pravdists won half the seats on the
Executive and a majority of the seats for alternate members. In all
countries the printers are most inclined towards opportunism, and some
grades among them are highly paid workers.  

If our conclusion about the minority of the workers, the labour
aristocracy, being in sympathy with the liquidators

    

is merely conjectural, there can be no doubt whatever where
individuals are concerned. Of the contributions made by
non-workers, more than half came from individuals (531 out of 713
in our case, 266 out of 453 in the case of the liquidators). The average
contribution from this source in our case is R.1.97 whereas among the
liquidators it is R.6.05! 

In the first case, the contributions obviously came from lower-paid
office workers, civil servants, etc., and from the petty-bourgeois elements
of a semi-proletarian character. In the case of the liquidators, however,
we see that they have rich friends among the bourgeoisie.  

These rich friends from among the bourgeoisie take still more definite
shape as “groups of adherents, friends, etc.” These groups collected
R.458.82 for us, i. e., two per cent of the total sum collected, the
average donation per group being R.10.92, which is only half as much again
as the average donation of workers’ groups. For the liquidators, however,
these groups collected R.2,450.60, i. e., over 20 per cent of the
total sum collected, the average donation per group being R.45.39,
i. e., six times the average collected by workers’ groups!  

To this we add the collections made abroad, where bourgeois students
are the main contributors. We received R.49.79 from this source, i. e.,
less than one-fourth of one per cent; the liquidators received R.1,709.17,
i. e., 14 per cent.  

If we add up individuals, “adherents and friends”, and collections
made abroad, the total amount collected from these sources will be as
follows: 

Pravdists—R.1,555.23, i. e., 7 per cent of the total
collections.  

Liquidators—R.5,768.09, i. e., 48 per cent of the total
collections.  

From this source we received less than one-tenth of what we received
from the workers’ groups (R.18,934). This source gave the liquidators
more than they received from the workers’ groups (R.5,296)!  

The inference is clear: the liquidationist newspaper is not a
workers’ but a bourgeois newspaper. It is run mainly on funds
contributed by rich friends from among the bourgeoisie.  
 

As a matter of fact, the liquidators are far more dependent upon the
bourgeoisie than our figures show. The Pravdist newspapers have
frequently published their financial re ports for public
information. These reports have shown that our newspaper, by adding
collections to its income, is paying its way. With a circulation of 40,000
(the average for May 1914), this is understandable, in spite of
confiscations and a dearth of advertisements. The liquidators, however,
published their report only once (Luch No. 101), showing
a deficit of 4,000 rubles. After this, they adopted the usual bourgeois
custom of not publishing reports. With a circulation of 15,000, their
newspaper cannot avoid a deficit, and evidently this is covered again and
again by their rich friends from among the bourgeoisie.  

Liberal-labour politicians like to drop hints about an “open
workers’ party”, but they do not like to reveal to genuine
workers their actual dependence upon the bourgeoisie! It is left for us,
“underground” workers, to teach the liquidator-liberals the benefit of
open reports....  

The overall ratio of worker and non-worker collections is as follows:

The Pravdists get one-seventh of their aid collections from the
bourgeoisie and, as we have seen, from its most democratic and least
wealthy sections. The liquidationist undertaking is largely a
bourgeois undertaking, which is supported only by a minority of the
workers.  

The figures concerning the sources of funds also reveal to us the class
status of the readers and buyers of the newspapers.  

Voluntary contributions are made only by regular readers, who most
intelligently sympathise with the trend of the given newspaper. In its
turn, the trend of the given news paper willy-nilly “adapts itself” to
the more “influential” section of its reading public.  
 

The deductions that follow from our figures are, first, theoretical,
i. e., such as will help the working class to understand the conditions of
its movement, and secondly, practical deductions, which will give us direct
guidance in our activities.  

It is sometimes said that there is not one working-class press in
Russia, but two. Even Plekhanov repeated this statement not long ago. But
that is not true. Those who say this betray sheer ignorance, if not a
secret desire to help the liquidators spread bourgeois influence among the
workers. Long ago and repeatedly (for example, in 1908 and 1910), the Party
decisions clearly, definitely, and directly pointed to the bourgeois nature
of liquidationism. Articles in the Marxist press have explained this truth
hundreds of times.  

The experience of a daily newspaper, which openly appeals to the
masses, was bound to disclose the real class character of
the liquidationist trend. And that is what it did. The
liquidationist newspaper has indeed proved to be a bourgeois undertaking,
which is supported by a minority of the workers.  

Moreover, let us not forget that almost up to the spring of 1914 the
liquidationist newspaper was the mouthpiece of the August bloc. It was only
lately that the Letts with drew from it, and Trotsky, Em-El, An,
Buryanov and Yegorov have left, or are leaving, the liquidators. The
break-up of the bloc is continuing. The near future is bound to reveal
still more clearly the bourgeois character of the liquidationist
trend and the sterility of the intellectualist grouplets,
such as the Vperyodists, Plekhanovites, Trotskyists, etc.  

The practical deductions may be summed up in the following points: 

1)
5,674 workers’ groups united by the Pravdists in less than two-and-a-half
years is a fairly large number, considering the harsh conditions obtaining
in Russia. But this is only a beginning. We need, not thousands, but tens
of thousands of workers’ groups. We must intensify our activities
tenfold. Ten rubles collected in kopeks from hundreds of workers are more
important and valuable, both from the ideological and organisational point
of view, than a hundred rubles from rich friends among the bourgeoisie.

    

Even from the financial aspect, experience goes to prove that it is
possible to run a well-established workers’ newspaper with the aid of
workers’ kopeks, but impossible to do so with the aid of bourgeois
rubles. The liquidationist under taking is a bubble, which is bound to
burst.  

2)
We lag behind in the provinces, where 32 per cent of the workers’ groups
support the liquidators! Every class-conscious worker must exert every
effort to put an end to this lamentable and disgraceful state of
affairs. We must bring all our weight to bear in the provinces.  

3)
The rural workers are apparently still almost untouched by the
movement. Difficult as work in this field may be, we must press forward
with it in the most vigorous manner.  

4)
Like a mother who carefully tends a sick child and gives it better
nourishment,, the class-conscious workers must take more care of the
districts and factories where the workers are sick with
liquidationism. This malady, which emanates from the bourgeoisie, is
inevitable in a young working-class movement, but with proper care and
persistent treatment, it will pass without any serious after effects. To
provide the sick workers with more plentiful nourishment in the shape of
Marxist literature, to explain more carefully and in more popular form the
history and tactics of the Party and the meaning of the Party decisions on
the bourgeois nature of liquidationism, to explain at greater length the
urgent necessity of proletarian unity, i. e., the submission of the
minority of the workers to the majority, the submission of the one-fifth to
the four-fifths of the class-conscious workers of Russia—such are some of
the most important tasks confronting us.

Marxists have repeatedly spoken about the importance of the
free mobilisation (i.e., the buying, selling and mortgaging) of peasant
land. This real and, practical problem affords a striking illustration of
the petty-bourgeois and even positively reactionary character of
our Narodniks.  

All Narodniks, from the semi-Cadets of Russkoye Bogatstvo
(“Social-Cadets” as Chernov, Vikhlayev and similar people once rightly
called them) to the ultra-“Left” Narodniks of Stoikaya Mysl, are
opposed to the free mobilisation of peasant land in general, and of
allotment land in particular.  

The Marxists, however, openly state in their Programme that
they will “always and invariably oppose any attempt to check the
course of economic progress”.  

The economic development of Russia, as of the whole world, proceeds
from feudalism to capitalism, and through large-scale, machine, capitalist
production to socialism.  

Pipe-dreaming about a “different” way to socialism other than that
which leads, through the further development of capitalism,
through large-scale, machine, capitalist production, is, in
Russia, characteristic either of the liberal gentlemen, or of the backward,
petty proprietors (the petty bourgeoisie). These dreams, which still clog
the brains of the Left Narodniks, merely reflect the backwardness
(reactionary nature) and feebleness of the petty bourgeoisie.  

Class-conscious workers all over the world, Russia included, are
becoming more and more convinced of the correctness of Marxism, for life
itself is proving to them that only large-scale, machine production rouses
the workers, enlightens and organises them, and creates the
objective conditions for a mass movement.  
 

When Put Pravdy reaffirmed the well-known Marxist axiom that
capitalism is progressive as compared with
      feudalism,[1]

and that the idea of checking the development of capitalism is a utopia,
most absurd, reactionary, and harmful to the working people,
Mr. N. Rakitnikov, the Left Narodnik (in Smelaya Mysl No. 7),
accused Put Pravdy of having undertaken the “not very honourable
task of putting a gloss upon the capitalist noose”.  

Anyone interested in Marxism and in the experience of the international
working-class movement would do well to pander over this! One rarely meets
with such amazing ignorance of Marxism as that displayed by
Mr. N. Rakitnikov and the Left Narodniks, except perhaps among bourgeois
economists.  

Can it be that Mr. Rakitnikov has not read Capital, or The
Poverty of Philosophy, or The Communist Manifesto? If he has
not, then it is pointless to talk about socialism. That will be a
ridiculous waste of time.  

If he has read them, then he ought to know that the
fundamental idea running through all Marx’s works, an
idea which since Marx has been confirmed in all countries, is that
capitalism is progressive as compared with feudalism. It is in
this sense that Marx and all Marxists “put a gloss” (to use Rakitnikov’s
clumsy and stupid expression) “upon the capitalist noose”!  

Only anarchists or petty-bourgeois, who do not under stand the
conditions of historical development, can say:
a feudal noose or a capitalist one—it makes no difference, for both are
nooses! That means confining oneself to condemnation, and failing
to understand the objective course of economic development.  

Condemnation means our subjective dissatisfaction. The objective course
of feudalism’s evolution into capitalism enables millions of
working people—thanks to the growth of cities, railways, large factories
and the migration of workers—to escape from a condition of
feudal torpor. Capitalism itself rouses and organises them.  

Both feudalism and capitalism oppress the workers and strive to keep
them in ignorance. But feudalism can keep,

    

and for centuries has kept, millions of peasants in a down trodden
state (for example, in Russia from the ninth to the nineteenth century, in
China for even more centuries). But capitalism cannot keep the
workers in a state of immobility, torpor, downtroddenness and ignorance.


The centuries of feudalism were centuries of torpor for the working
people.  

The decades of capitalism have roused millions of wage-workers.  

Your failure to understand this, gentlemen of the Left Narodnik
fraternity, shows that you do not understand a thing about socialism, or
that you are converting socialism from a struggle of millions engendered by
objective conditions into a benevolent old gentleman’s fairy-tale!  

To advocate the slightest restriction of the freedom to
mobilise allotment land actually amounts to becoming a
reactionary, an abettor of the feudalists.  

Restriction of the freedom to mobilise allotment land retards
economic development, hinders the formation, growth, awakening and
organisation of the wage-worker class, worsens the conditions of
the workers and peasants, and increases the influence of the
feudalists.  

The Peshekhonovs and Rakitnikovs are in fact abettors of
precisely these “categories”, when they advocate restriction of the
freedom to mobilise peasant land.

The agrarian question in Russia is of tremendous importance at the
present time. It is common knowledge that this question has been given
front-rank prominence, not only by the broad masses of the people, but also
by the government.  

Historically, the movement of 1905 was characterised precisely by the
fact that the vast majority of the population in Russia, namely, the
peasantry, made the agrarian question a key issue. Both the
liberal-bourgeois party and the workers’ party took this fact into
consideration in their respective programmes. On the other hand, when the
government, in its June Third regime, brought about an alliance between the
landlords and the upper stratum of the bourgeoisie, it made the agrarian
question the pivot of its policy (the forcible destruction of communal
landownership and the conversion of allotment land into private property,
mainly in the homestead system).  

What is the economic essence of the agrarian question in Russia? It is
the reorganisation of Russia on bourgeois-democratic lines. Russia has
become a capitalist, bourgeois country, but the system of landownership in
this country has to a very large degree remained feudal, as regards both
landlordism and peasant allotment ownership. In very many cases the system
of land economy has remained feudal: labour service and the corvée,
under which the semi ruined, pauperised, and starving petty proprietors
rent land, grassland and pastures and borrow money from the landlords, with
the obligation to repay the debt by working on the “squire’s” land.  

The more feudalist rural Rus lags behind
industrial, commercial, capitalist Russia, the more complete will be

    

the inevitable break-up of the ancient, feudalist system of landownership,
both landlordism and allotment ownership.  

The landlords tried to effect this break-up in the land lord fashion,
to suit the interests of the landlords, retaining their own landed estates,
and helping the kulaks to grab the peasants’ land. The majority of the
peasants tried to do this in peasant fashion, to suit the interests of the
peasants.  

In either case the reform remains bourgeois in character. In
his Poverty of Philosophy, in Capital, and in
Theories of Surplus-Value, Marx amply proved that the
bourgeois economists often demanded the nationalisation
of the land, i.e., the conversion of all land into public property, and
that this measure was a fully bourgeois measure. Capitalism will
develop more widely, more freely and more quickly from such a measure. This
measure is very progressive and very democratic. It will do away completely
with serfdom, will break the monopoly in land, and will abolish
absolute rent (the existence of which the liquidator P. Maslov,
trailing in the wake of bourgeois scholars, erroneously denies). It will
speed up the development of the productive forces in agriculture and purge
the class movement among the wage-workers.  

But, we repeat, this is a bourgeois-democratic measure. Like
Mr. V—dimov in Smelaya Mysl, the Left Narodniks persist in
calling the bourgeois nationalisation of the land
“socialisation” and persistently ignore Marx’s comprehensive
explanations of what nationalisation of land under capitalism implies.


The Left Narodniks persist in reiterating the purely bourgeois theory
of “labour economy” and its development under “socialisation”, whereas,
in fact, with the nationalisation of the land, it is capitalist
landownership in its purest form, free of feudalism, that will inevitably
develop more widely and quickly.  

The catchword of “socialisation of the land” merely denotes the Left
Narodniks’ utter failure to grasp the principles of Marx’s political
economy, and the fact that they are going over (stealthily, by fits and
starts, and often unconsciously) to the side of bourgeois political
economy.  
 

Marx advised class-conscious workers, while forming a clear idea of the
bourgeois character of all agrarian reforms under capitalism (including the
nationalisation of the land), to support bourgeois-democratic reforms as
against the feudalists and serfdom. But Marxists cannot confuse bourgeois
measures with socialism.

Can abusive language have political significance?—the
reader will ask.  

Undoubtedly. Here is an example taken from a field all class-conscious
workers are interested in.  

We, Pravdists, are abused for “usurpers”, people who seize power
illegally. In March 1912, the Plekhanovites, Vperyodists,
Trotskyists, the liquidators, and a host of other groups “united” to
abuse us in this way.  

Now, in June 1914, after a lapse of two odd years, the
supporters of Yedinstvo, the liquidators, Vperyodists, Trotskyists
and probably a dozen other groups, are once more “uniting” to
abuse us.  

To help the reader grasp the political significance of this
vituperation, we ask him to recall certain elementary things that the
supporters of Yedinstvo and Co. are trying to “talk away” with
their clamour and abuse.  

“They” have all declared the Conference of January 1912 to be an act
of usurpation, illegal seizure of power. That Conference, they argue, had
no right to call itself the supreme organ of the entire Marxist body.  

Splendid, gentlemen! But see how the political facts expose
the inanity and falsity of your phrases.  

Let us assume that you are right, and that the Conference of
January 1912 was an “illegal seizure of power”. What follows from that?


It follows that all the groups, trends and circles, and all the
Social-Democrats who resented this “illegal seizure of power”, should
have stood up for the “law”. Is that not so? They should have
united, not only to vilify the usurpers, but also to overthrow
them.  
 

This would seem indisputable, would it not?  

It would seem that the brave Plekhanov, the courageous Trotsky, the
bold Vperyodists and the noble liquidators could not have united
to abuse the usurpers without also uniting for the purpose of
overthrowing the usurpers.  

If our heroes had not done that, they would have shown themselves to be
mere windbags, would they not?  

And what had to be done to overthrow the “usurpers”?  

All that the noble protestants against usurpation had to do was to get
together without the usurpers, condemn them, and show the workers
a practical example, a fact—a fact and not promises,
deeds and not phrases—of what legitimate bodies are like, as distinct
from usurpatory ones.  

Only a person who regards all class-conscious workers in Russia as
idiots could fail to agree that what these workers would have done, on
seeing the united activities of the noble protestants against the
“usurpers”, would be to support these protestants, throw out the
usurpers, and treat them with ridicule and scorn!  

Clear enough, it would seem?  

One would think it absolutely indisputable that it was the bounden
duty, not only of every Marxist, but of every self-respecting
democrat, to unite with all opponents of “usurpation”, with the purpose
of overthrowing the usurpers.  

But actually?  

What actually happened?  

What happened two years after our noble opponents of
“usurpation” took the field against the usurpers?  

What happened was that the “usurpers” united 4/5 (four
fifths) of all the class-conscious workers of Russia around their
decisions.  

For two-and-a-half years, from January 1, 1912, to May 13, 1914, the
Pravdist newspapers received financial support from 5,674 workers’ groups,
while the noble opponents of “usurpation”, the liquidators and their
friends, received the support of 1,421 workers’ groups.  

The “usurpers” brought about the unity of four-fifths of the
workers of Russia, not merely in word, but in deed.  

The noble enemies of “usurpation”, however, went up in smoke, for
their August bloc collapsed; Trotsky, the Letts,

    

the Caucasian leaders, etc., fell away in separate little groups,
which, in the actual movement, proved to be mere cyphers, both
individually and collectively.  

How is this miracle to be explained?  

How could four-fifths of the workers stand for vile
“usurpation” against the numerous, manifold, noble enemies of
usurpation who represented “a multitude of trends”?  

Reader, this could and had to happen for the following reason: in
politics abusive language often serves as a screen for utter lack of
principles and sterility, impotence, angry impotence, on the part of those
who use such language.  

That is all there is to it.  

But in spite of all the abuse that is heaped on the Pravdists,
“usurpers”, Leninists, etc., the class-conscious workers are uniting, and
will continue to uniter around the principles and tactics of consistent
Marxism. Despite all this kind of language, they recognise unity only
from below, the unity of the workers based on condemnation of
liquidationism, on acceptance of all the decisions of the “entire
Marxist body”. The subordination of the minority to the majority, not
compromise with intellectualist groups—only this can serve as the
principle of the working-class movement.

There can be no more important duty for class-conscious
workers than that of getting to know their class movement, its
nature, its aims and objects, its conditions and practical forms. That is
because the strength of the working-class movement lies entirely in its
political consciousness, and its mass character. At each step in
its development, capitalism increases the number of proletarians, wage
workers; it rallies, organises and enlightens them, and in this way moulds
a class force that must inevitably march towards its goal.  

The Marxists’ programme and their decisions on tactics, as constantly
expounded in the press, help the masses of the workers to understand the
nature, aims and objects of the movement.  

The struggle between the various trends in the working-class movement
of Russia has deep class roots. The two “trends” which are fighting
Marxism (Pravdism) in the working-class movement of Russia and which,
because of their mass form and their roots in history, deserve to be called
“trends”, i.e., Narodism and liquidationism, express the bourgeoisie’s
influence on the proletariat. This has been explained many times by the
Marxists and acknowledged in a number of decisions adopted by them in
regard to the Narodniks (the fight against whom has been going on for
thirty years) and in regard to the liquidators (the history of
liquidationism goes back about twenty years, for liquidationism is the
direct continuation of Economism and Menshevism).  
 

More objective data on the strength of the different trends in
Russia’s working-class movement are now steadily accumulating. Every
effort must be made to collect, verify and study these objective data
concerning the behaviour and moods, not of individuals or groups, but of the
masses, data taken from different and hostile newspapers, data
that are verifiable by any literate person.


Only from such data can one learn and study the movement of one’s
class. One of the greatest, if not the greatest, faults (or crimes against the
working class) of the Narodniks and liquidators, as well as of the various
groups of intellectuals such as the Vperyodists, Plekhanovites and Trotskyists,
is their subjectivism. At every step they try to pass off their
desires, their “views”, their appraisals of the situation and their
“plans”, as the will of the workers, the needs of the working-class
movement. When they talk about “unity”, for example, they
majestically ignore the experience acquired in creating the genuine
unity of the majority of Russia’s class-conscious workers in the
course of two-and-a-half years, from the beginning of 1912 to the middle of
1914.


Let us then tabulate the available objective data on the strength of
the various trends in the working-class movement. Those who believe in
subjective appraisals and promises are free to go to the
“groups”. We invite only those who desire to study objective
figures. Here they are:

First of all we shall briefly explain the above figures and then draw
the conclusions that follow from them.  

It will be best to make the explanations point by point.  

Point 1.
Figures showing the number of electors and delegates elected are not
available. To complain about our using “curia” figures is simply
ridiculous, for no other are available. The German Social-Democrats measure
their successes under the Bismarck electoral law, which excludes women and
thereby creates a “male” curia!  

Point 2.
The number of workers’ groups which pay and not only “sign resolutions”
is the most reliable and true criterion, not only of the strength of the
trend, but also of its state of organisation and its Party spirit.  

That is why the liquidators and the “groups” betray such subjective
dislike for this criterion.  

The liquidators argued: We have also a Yiddish and a Georgian
newspapers, but the Pravda stands alone. That is not
true. Firstly, the Estonian and Lithuanian newspapers are
Pravdist.[4] Secondly, if we take the provinces, is it permissible to
forget Moscow?  During 1913 the Moscow workers’
newspaper[5] rallied, united 390 workers’ groups
(Rabochy No. 1, p. 19), whereas the Yiddish newspaper
Zeit, from issue No. 2 (December 29, 1912) to June 1, 1914, united
296 workers’ groups (of these 190 were united up to

    

March 20, 1914, and 106 from March 20 to June 1, 1914). Thus, Moscow alone
amply “covered” the liquidators’ subjective reference to Zeit!


We invite the Georgian and Armenian comrades to collect data on the
liquidators’ newspapers in the Caucasus. How many workers’ groups are
there? Objective data covering all aspects are needed.  

Mistakes in counting the groups may have been made, but only in
individual cases. We invite everybody to verify the figures and correct
them.  

Points 3 and 4
require no explanation. It would be desirable to initiate an enquiry for
the purpose of collecting new data from the provinces.  

Point 5.
The 2,985 liquidator signatures include 1,086 Bundist and 719
Caucasian signatures. It is desirable that the local comrades verify these
figures.  

Point 6.
The treasurers of the two groups publish reports of all funds each
group receives for various objects. These figures serve as an exact and
objective index of contacts with the workers.  

Point 7.
Circulation of newspapers. The figures were collected and published by
E. Vandervelde but hushed up by the liquidators and the liberals
(Kievskaya Mysl). “Subjectivism.” It is desirable that fuller
figures be collected, if only for one month.  

Points 8 and 9.
Here we have an objective illustration of the liquidators’ renunciation of
the “underground”, i. e., of the Party. But from January 1 to May 13,
1914, receipts from abroad gave the Pravdists R.49.79 (one-fourth of one
per cent) and the liquidators R.1,709.17 (fourteen per cent). Don’t say,
“I can’t”; say, “I don’t want to”!  

Points 10 to 14.
These are objective evidence of the dependence of the liquidators and
Narodniks on the bourgeoisie, evidence of their bourgeois
character. Subjectively, the liquidators and Narodniks are
“socialists” and “Social Democrats”. Objectively, both as
regards the substance of their ideas as well as the
experience of the mass movement, they are groups of bourgeois
intellectuals, which are splitting the minority of workers away from the
workers’ party.  

We especially draw our readers’ attention to the way in which the
liquidators fake workers’ correspondence. This

    

is an unprecedented and downright fraud! Let all Marxists in the localities
expose this fraud and collect objective data (see Trudovaya Pravda
No. 12, June 11,
1914[6]).  

Point 15.
These figures are particularly important and ought to be supplemented and
verified by means of a separate enquiry. We have taken the figures from
Sputnik Rabochego, Priboi Publishers, St. Petersburg,
1914.[7] Among the unions included in the liquidators’ list were the
Clerks’ Union, the Draftsmen’s Union, and the Druggist Employees’ Union (at
the last election of the Executive of the Printers’ Union on April 27,
1914, half the members of the Executive and more than half of the alternate
members elected were Pravdists). The Narodnik list of unions includes the
Bakers’ Union and the Case-Makers’ Union. Aggregate membership about
22,000.  

Of the thirteen unions in Moscow, ten are Pravdist and three
indefinite, although they are closer to the Pravdists. There is not a
single liquidationist or Narodnik union in Moscow.  

The conclusions to be drawn from these objective data are that Pravdism
is the only Marxist, proletarian trend, really independent of the
bourgeoisie, and has organised and united over four-fifths of the
workers (in 1914, 81.1 per cent of the workers’ groups as compared with the
liquidators). Liquidationism and Narodism are undoubtedly
bourgeois-democratic, not working-class trends.  

The correctness of the Pravdists’ programmatic, tactical and
organisational ideas, their decisions and line has been wholly and
splendidly confirmed by the experience of the mass movement in 1912, 1913
and half of 1914. From our conviction that we are on the right road we
should draw the strength for still greater efforts.

The article “Objective Data on the Strength of the Various Trends
in the Working-Class Movement” was written by Lenin on the basis of a
wide range of facts and figures, carefully collected and analysed,
concerning money collections for the workers’ press, which served as
objective evidence of the strength of the various trends in the
working-class movement in Russia. The Central Party Archive of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the Central Committee of the
C.P.S.U. has in its possession the manuscripts of Lenin’s computations of
the collections made by the newspaper Pravda, the number of
workers’ groups united by the newspaper Zeit and their
contributions, the computations to the table given in the article (See
pp.382–85 of this volume),and tabulated figures showing what collections
were made for the various newspapers and where they were made. The original
draft conspectus and a synopsis of the article are also to be found in the
Archive. The figures quoted in this article ware used by Lenin in
subsequent articles.

This refers to T&owhatthe&owhatthe H\"a\"al (The Voice
of Labour), an Estonian newspaper of a Pravdist trend, which appeared
in Narva three times a

   

week from January to May 1914, and the Lithuanian weekly Flints
(The Wave), published in Riga in 1913–14.





[5]
This refers to the legal workers’ newspaper Nash Put (Our Way)
published in Moscow, the first issue appearing on August 25 (September 7),
1913. Lenin took an active pert in the newspaper, sending his articles
simultaneously to Pravda and Nash Put. The latter
published a number of articles by Lenin, namely: “The Russian Bourgeoisie
and Russian Reformism”, “The Role of Social Estates and Classes in the
Liberation Movement”, “Class War in Dublin”, “A Week After the Dublin
Massacre”, “Questions of Principle in Politics”, “Harry Quelch” and
others.  

Other contributors to the newspaper were Maxim Gorky, Demyan Bedny,
M. S. Olminsky, I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov, and the Bolshevik deputies in the
Fourth Duma A. Y. Badayev, F. N. Samoilov, and N. R. Shagov.  

Nash Put was very popular among the workers, as many as 395
workers’ groups supporting the newspaper with money contributions. The
newspaper was persistently persecuted by the police and closed down on
September 12 (25), 1913, after publishing 16 issues. The Moscow workers
struck in protest against its suppression, but the paper was unable to
resume publication.





[6]
The newspaper Trudovaya Pravda No. 12 for June 11, 1914,
published a paragraph entitled “How Does It Happen?”, in which it quoted
a number of instances of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, the organ of the
liquidators, reprinting, under the guise of workers’ correspondence,
information from the bourgeois newspapers which distorted the facts of
reality in working-class life.

“Strikes in Russia”. (See present edition, Vol. 19, p. 385.)

Throughout the world a section of the workers, as is well
known, still follows the lead of various bourgeois parties. During the
period of bourgeois-democratic reform in Russia, a minority of the
class-conscious workers still follows the lead of the bourgeois group of
liquidationist writers, and of the bourgeois-democratic Narodnik trend.


It has been reiterated many times in precise, clearly formulated and official
decisions of the Marxists (1903, 1907 and
1913)[2] that the entire Narodnik trend, including the Left Narodniks,
is a bourgeois (peasant) democracy in Russia. That some of the workers
should follow the lead of the Left Narodniks, who describe radical
peasant (but in substance downright bourgeois) demands as
“socialism”, is quite natural in a capitalist country during an intense
movement against survivals of serfdom.  

But exactly which section of the class-conscious workers follows the
lead of the Left Narodniks?  

Sovremennik, one of the most unprincipled intellectualist
journals, which (on the basis of false phrases) “unites” the Left
Narodniks, Plekhanov, and Mr. Potresov and Co., recently stated that
“about” one-third of the workers follow the lead of the Left Narodniks.


This is a barefaced, deliberate lie, like those commonly uttered by the
liquidators.  

As far as we know, only three sets of objective data showing the degree
of influence the Left Narodniks exercise among the workers are
available. These are, firstly, the circulation figures of the
newspapers. Secondly, the figures showing the number of workers’ groups
which have collected funds.

    

Thirdly, the figures showing the number of delegates elected to the
Metropolitan Insurance Board.  

We shall compare these data, which differ from the bare faced lies of
Martov, Himmer and Co. in that anybody can find them in open and
public sources appertaining to the different parties, and verify
them.

The circulation figures are the most “favourable” to the bourgeois
groups (the liquidators and Left Narodniks). But the liquidator and
Left-Narodnik newspapers are bourgeois newspapers, not
working-class!  This is proved by the figures of the funds collected (from
January 1 to May 13, 1914). The liquidators’ reports show that 56 per cent
of their total collections came from non-workers (Trudovaya
Pravda
       No. 15).[1]

In the case of the Left Narodniks, 50 per cent of their collections came
from this source. More over, as far as is known, the Left Narodniks have
never published the financial reports of their newspaper, which, like that
of the liquidators, is evidently maintained by rich friends from among
the bourgeoisie.  
 

The Pravdist newspaper is the only working-class newspaper. Both the
liquidationist and the Left-Narodnik news papers are bourgeois
newspapers. No lie can refute this objective fact.  

The figures of the workers’ groups approach most closely and exactly to
European party membership figures.  

The number of Left-Narodnik groups is growing very rapidly (it has
doubled in the course of the year) and now constitutes 12.8 per cent of the
total groups of all the newspapers. Their number is growing at the
expense of the liquidators, for the number of the latter’s groups is
almost at a standstill (an increase of only ten groups in the first half of
1914 at a time when the working-class movement showed an enormous growth)
and their percentage is diminishing:
from 21.3 per cent to 16.6 per cent.  

By their opportunism and renunciation of the Party, the liquidators are
pushing their working-class supporters towards the other, more
“radical” (in word) bourgeois group.  

Between 1913 and 1914, the Pravdists obtained 692 new groups, the
liquidators 10, and the Left Narodniks 260. In percentages the increases
are: Pravdists plus 31.7, liquidators plus 1.5, Left Narodniks plus 100
(small figures always increase faster than big ones; for example, if
Plekhanov has nine workers’ groups and, by the time of Vienna—and for
Vienna[3]—there will be 27 or 45, the percentage increase will be
plus 200, or plus 400).  

The Insurance Board election figures apply only to St. Petersburg. It
should be said that in 1914 the Left Narodniks in St. Petersburg are
ahead of the liquidators as far as collection by workers’ groups
is concerned.  

Thus, between January 1 and May 13, 1914, the Pravdists in
St. Petersburg received contributions from 2,024 workers’ groups, the
liquidators from 308 and the Left Narodniks from 391 groups. The
percentages are: Pravdists 74.3, liquidators 11.4, Left Narodniks 14.3.


Like the true opportunists they are, our liquidators reacted to this
increase in strength of the Left Narodniks, not by intensifying their
struggle for the principles of Marxism, but by entering into a bloc with
the Left Narodniks against the Marxists (Pravdists)!  
 

The Left Narodniks, in Sovremennik, openly advocate such an
alliance on behalf of all their leaders; but the liquidators lack the
courage to explain their conduct to the workers openly and
straightforwardly. They do it in an underhand way. They are genuine Cadets.


For example. Recently, the Left-Narodnik newspaper (Zhivaya Mysl
Truda No. 3, June 15, 1914) published an article entitled “The
Insurance Delegates Elections at the Aivaz Works”. In this article we
read: ... “Of necessity, the Aivaz workers will be offered a choice of two
lists:
one, a joint Menshevik and Left-Narodnik list ... the other a
Pravdist list....” (Our italics.)  

Alliance with the liquidators is interpreted in this article by the
Left Narodniks as the principle of co-operation among all
“socialist” trends, i. e., the liquidators are alleged to have
renounced not only the resolution of 1907, which defined the Left Narodniks
as a bourgeois trend, but also the resolution of 1903 proposed by Axelrod.


Marxists regard the increase in the Left Narodniks’ strength as a
symptom, or presage, of a revival among the peasantry which, of course, is
enough to “turn the heads” of non-class-conscious proletarians and
petty-bourgeois intellectuals. As far as we Marxists are concerned, this
fact will only stimulate our efforts in advocating Marxism as against
petty-bourgeois Narodism.  

Fellow-workers! Put less faith in promises and fairy-tales! Study more
closely the objective data on your own working-class movement and
on how the bourgeois ideas and the bourgeois practices of the liquidators
and Left Narodniks influence a minority of the workers.

follows: =

1) The high cost of living, =

questions: (a) the Eastern question, (b) compulsory courts of arbitration

The number of delegates was not to exceed the number of votes of the
given country by more than sixfold. Russia had 20 votes, consequently not
more than 120 delegates for both subsections of the Social-Democrats and
the Left Narodniks and for the trade unions.  

The question of the International Socialist Congress in Vienna was
discussed at the Poronin meeting of the C. C. and Party workers. Lenin made
a report on this question, and proposed that every effort be made to send a
majority of Social-Democratic worker delegates to the Vienna Congress.


Election of delegates to the International Socialist Congress was
practically completed by the end of July 1914, but the out break of war
prevented the Congress from convening.

## What Is Meant




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 1. WHAT IS MEANT BY THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF NATIONS?








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination





Clause 9  of the Russian Marxists’ Programme, which deals
with the right of nations to self-determination, has (as we have already
pointed out in
      Prosveshcheniye)[1]

given rise lately to a crusade on the part of the opportunists. The Russian
liquidator Semkovsky, in the St. Petersburg liquidationist newspaper, and
the Bundist Liebman and the Ukrainian nationalist-socialist Yurkevich in
their respective periodicals have violently attacked this clause and
treated it with supreme contempt. There is no doubt that this campaign of a
motley array of opportunists against our Marxist Programme is closely
connected with present-day nationalist vacillations in general. Hence we
consider a detailed examination of this question timely. We would mention,
in passing, that none of the opportunists named above has offered a single
argument of his own; they all merely repeat what Rosa Luxemburg said in her
lengthy Polish article of 1908–09, “The National Question and
Autonomy”. In our exposition we shall deal mainly with the “original”
arguments of this last-named author.  

1. WHAT IS MEANT BY THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF
NATIONS?

Naturally,  this is the first question that arises when any attempt is
made at a Marxist examination of what is known as self-determination. What
should be understood by that term? Should the answer be sought in legal
definitions deduced from all sorts of “general concepts” of law? Or is it
rather to be sought in a historico-economic study of the national
movements?  

It  is not surprising that the Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches did
not even think of raising this question,

 

and shrugged it off by scoffing at the “obscurity” of the Marxist
Programme, apparently unaware, in their simplicity, that the
self-determination of nations is dealt with, not only in the Russian
Programme of 1903, but in the resolution of the London International
Congress of 1896 (with which I shall deal in detail in the proper
place). Far more surprising is the fact that Rosa Luxemburg, who declaims a
great deal about the supposedly abstract and metaphysical nature of the
clause in question, should herself succumb to the sin of abstraction and
metaphysics. It is Rosa Luxemburg herself who is continually lapsing into
generalities about self-determination (to the extent even of philosophising
amusingly on the question of how the will of the nation is to be
ascertained), without any where clearly and precisely asking herself
whether the gist of the matter lies in legal definitions or in the
experience of the national movements throughout the world.  

A precise formulation of this question, which no Marxist can avoid,
would at once destroy nine-tenths of Rosa Luxemburg’s arguments. This is
not the first time that national movements have arisen in Russia, nor are
they peculiar to that country alone. Throughout the world, the period of
the final victory of capitalism over feudalism has been linked up with
national movements. For the complete victory of commodity production, the
bourgeoisie must capture the home market, and there must be politically
united territories whose population speak a single language, with all
obstacles to the development of that language and to its consolidation in
literature eliminated. Therein is the economic foundation of national
movements. Language is the most important means of human intercourse. Unity
and unimpeded development of language are the most important conditions for
genuinely free and extensive commerce on a scale commensurate with modern
capitalism, for a free and broad grouping of the population in all its
various classes and, lastly, for the establishment of a close connection
between the market and each and every proprietor, big or little, and
between seller and buyer.  

Therefore,  the tendency of every national movement is towards the
formation of national states, under which these requirements of
modern capitalism are best satisfied. The

 

most profound economic factors drive towards this goal, and, therefore, for
the whole of Western Europe, nay, for the entire civilised world, the
national state is typical and normal for the capitalist period.


Consequently,  if we want to grasp the meaning of self-determination of
nations, not by juggling with legal definitions, or “inventing” abstract
definitions, but by examining the historico-economic conditions of the
national movements, we must inevitably reach the conclusion that the
self-determination of nations means the political separation of these
nations from alien national bodies, and the formation of an independent
national state.  

Later  on we shall see still other reasons why it would be wrong to
interpret the right to self-determination as meaning-anything but the right
to existence as a separate state. At present, we must deal with Rosa
Luxemburg’s efforts to “dismiss” the inescapable conclusion that profound
economic factors underlie the urge towards a national state.  

Rosa  Luxemburg is quite familiar with Kautsky’s pamphlet
Nationality and Internationality. (Supplement to Die Neue
Zeit[2] No.11, 1907–08; Russian translation in the journal
Nauchnaya
Mysl,[3] Riga, 1908.) She is aware that, after carefully analysing
the question of the national state in §4 of that pamphlet, Kautsky
arrived at the conclusion that Otto Bauer “underestimates the
strength of the urge towards a national state” (p. 23 of the
pamphlet). Rosa Luxemburg herself quotes the following words of Kautsky’s:


“The  national state is the form most suited to present-day
conditions, [i. e., capitalist, civilised, economically progressive
conditions, as distinguished from medieval, pre-capitalist, etc.]; it is
the form in which the state can best fulfil its tasks” (i. e., the tasks
of securing the freest, widest and speediest development of capitalism). To
this we must add Kautsky’s still more precise concluding remark that states
of mixed national composition (known as multi national states, as distinct
from national states) are “always those whose internal constitution has
for some reason or other remained abnormal or underdeveloped”
(backward). Needless to say, Kautsky speaks of abnormality exclusively in
the sense of lack of conformity with what is best adapted to the
requirements of a developing capitalism.  


The  question now is: How did Rosa Luxemburg treat these
historico-economic conclusions of Kautsky’s? Are they right or wrong? Is
Kautsky right in his historico-economic theory, or is Bauer, whose theory
is basically psychological? What is the connection between Bauer’s
undoubted “national opportunism”, his defence of cultural-national
autonomy, his nationalistic infatuation (“an occasional emphasis on the
national aspect”, as Kautsky put it), his “enormous exaggeration of the
national aspect and complete neglect of the international aspect”
(Kautsky)—and his underestimation of the strength of the urge to create a
national state?  

Rosa  Luxemburg has not even raised this question. She has not noticed
the connection. She has not considered the sum total of Bauer’s
theoretical views. She has not even drawn a line between the
historico-economic and the psychological theories of the national
question. She confines herself to the following remarks in criticism of
Kautsky: 


   “This  ‘best’ national state is only an abstraction,
   which can easily be developed and defended theoretically, but which does
   not correspond to reality.” (Przeglad
   Socjaldemokratyczny, 1908, No. 6, p. 499.)  


And  in corroboration of this emphatic statement there follow arguments
to the effect that the “right to self-determination” of small nations is
made illusory by the development of the great capitalist powers and by
imperialism. “Can one seriously speak,” Rosa Luxemburg exclaims, “about
the ‘self-determination’ of the formally independent Montenegrins,
Bulgarians, Rumanians, Serbs, Greeks, partly even the Swiss, whose
independence is itself a result of the political struggle and the
diplomatic game of the ‘concert of Europe’?!” (P. 500.) The state that
best suits these conditions is “not a national state, as Kautsky believes,
but a predatory one”. Some dozens of figures are quoted relating to the
size of British, French and other colonial possessions.  

After  reading such arguments, one cannot help marvelling at the
author’s ability to misunderstand the how and the why of
things. To teach Kautsky, with a serious mien, that small states are
economically dependent on big ones, that a struggle is raging among the
bourgeois states for the predatory suppression of other nations, and that
imperialism

 

and colonies exist—all this is a ridiculous and puerile attempt to be
clever, for none of this has the slightest bearing on the subject. Not only
small states, but even Russia, for example, is entirely dependent,
economically, on the power of the imperialist finance capital of the
“rich” bourgeois countries. Not only the miniature Balkan states, but
even nineteenth-century America was, economically, a colony of Europe, as
Marx pointed out in
Capital.[4] Kautsky, like any Marxist, is, of course, well
aware of this, but that has nothing whatever to do with the question of
national movements and the national state.  

For  the question of the political self-determination of nations and
their independence as states in bourgeois society, Rosa Luxemburg has
substituted the question of their economic independence. This is just as
intelligent as if someone, in discussing the programmatic demand for the
supremacy of parliament, i. e., the assembly of people’s representatives,
in a bourgeois state, were to expound the perfectly correct conviction that
big capital dominates in a bourgeois country, whatever the regime in it.


There  is no doubt that the greater part of Asia, the most densely
populated continent, consists either of colonies of the “Great Powers”,
or of states that are extremely dependent and oppressed as nations. But
does this commonly-known circumstance in any way shake the undoubted fact
that in Asia itself the conditions for the most complete development of
commodity production and the freest, widest and speediest growth of
capitalism have been created only in Japan, i. e., only in an independent
national state? The latter is a bourgeois state, and for that reason has
itself begun to oppress other nations and to enslave colonies. We cannot say
whether Asia will have had time to develop into a system of independent
national states, like Europe, before the collapse of capitalism, but it
remains an undisputed fact that capitalism, having awakened Asia, has
called forth national movements everywhere in that continent, too; that the
tendency of these movements is towards the creation of national states in
Asia; that it is such states that ensure, the best conditions for the
development of capitalism. The example of Asia speaks in favour of
Kautsky and against Rosa Luxemburg.  


The  example of the Balkan states likewise contradicts her, for anyone
can now see that the best conditions for the development of capitalism in
the Balkans are created precisely in proportion to the creation of
independent national states in that peninsula.  

Therefore,  Rosa Luxemburg notwithstanding, the example of the whole of
progressive and civilised mankind, the example of the Balkans and that of
Asia prove that Kautsky’s proposition is absolutely correct: the national
state is the rule and the “norm” of capitalism; the multi-national state
represents backwardness, or is an exception. From the standpoint of
national relations, the best conditions for the development of capitalism
are undoubtedly provided by the national state. This does not mean, of
course, that such a state, which is based on bourgeois relations, can
eliminate the exploitation and oppression of nations. It only means that
Marxists cannot lose sight of the powerful economic factors that
give rise to the urge to create national states. It means that
“self-determination of nations” in the Marxists’ Programme
cannot, from a historico-economic point of view, have any other
meaning than political self-determination, state independence, and the
formation of a national state.  

The  conditions under which the bourgeois-democratic demand for a
“national state” should be supported from a Marxist, i. e.,
class-proletarian, point of view will be dealt with in detail below. For
the present, we shall confine ourselves to the definition of the
concept of “self-determination”, and only note that Rosa
Luxemburg knows what this concept means (“national state”),
whereas her opportunist partisans, the Liebmans, the Semkovskys, the
Yurkeviches, do not even know that!

W. Liebknecht R. Luxemburg, F. Mehring, Clara Zetkin, G. V. Plekhanov and
P. Lafargue. Beginning with the late nineties, after the death of Engels,
the journal regularly published articles by revisionists, including a
series of articles by E. Bernstein “Problems of Socialism”, which
launched a revisionists’ campaign against Marxism. During World War I the
journal took a centrist stand and supported the social-chauvinists.

## Historically
      Concrete Presentation




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 2. THE HISTORICALLY CONCRETE PRESENTATION OF THE QUESTION








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



2. THE HISTORICALLY CONCRETE PRESENTATION OF THE
QUESTION

The  categorical requirement of Marxist theory in investigating any
social question is that it be examined within definite historical
limits, and, if it refers to a particular country (e. g., the national
programme for a given country), that account be taken of the specific
features

 

distinguishing that country from others in the same historical epoch.  

What  does this categorical requirement of Marxism imply in its
application to the question under discussion?  

First  of all, it implies that a clear distinction must be drawn between
the two periods of capitalism, which differ radically from each other as
far as the national movement is concerned. On the one hand, there is the
period of the collapse of feudalism and absolutism, the period of the
formation of the bourgeois-democratic society and state, when the national
movements for the first time become mass movements and in one way or
another draw all classes of the population into politics through
the press, participation in representative institutions, etc. On the other
hand, there is the period of fully formed capitalist states with a
long-established constitutional regime and a highly developed antagonism
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie—a period that may be called
the eve of capitalism’s downfall.  

The  typical features of the first period are: the awakening of national
movements and the drawing of the peasants, the most numerous and the most
sluggish section of the population, into these movements, in connection
with the struggle for political liberty in general, and for the rights of
the nation in particular. Typical features of the second period are: the
absence of mass bourgeois-democratic movements and the fact that developed
capitalism, in bringing closer together nations that have already been
fully drawn into commercial intercourse, and causing them to intermingle to
an increasing degree, brings the antagonism between internationally united
capital and the international working-class movement into the forefront.


Of  course, the two periods are not walled off from each other; they are
connected by numerous transitional links, the various countries differing
from each other in the rapidity of their national development, in the
national make up and distribution of their population, and so on. There can
be no question of the Marxists of any country drawing up their national
programme without taking into account all these general historical and
concrete state conditions.


It  is here that we come up against the weakest point in Rosa
Luxemburg’s arguments. With extraordinary zeal, she embellishes her article
with a collection of hard words directed against §9 of our Programme,
which she declares to be “sweeping”, “a platitude”, “a metaphysical
phrase”, and so on without end. It would be natural to expect an author
who so admirably condemns metaphysics (in the Marxist sense, i.e.,
anti-dialectics) and empty abstractions to set us an example of how to make
a concrete historical analysis of the question. The question at issue is
the national programme of the Marxists of a definite country—Russia, in a
definite period—the beginning of the twentieth century. But does Rosa
Luxemburg raise the question as to what historical period Russia
is passing through, or what are the concrete features of the
national question and the national movements of that particular
country in that particular period?  

No,  she does not! She says absolutely nothing about it! In her
work you will not find even the shadow of an analysis of how the national
question stands in Russia in the present historical period, or of
the specific features of Russia in this particular respect!  

We  are told that the national question in the Balkans is presented
differently from that in Ireland; that Marx appraised the Polish and Czech
national movements in the concrete conditions of 1848 in such and such a
way (a page of excerpts from Marx); that Engels appraised the struggle of
the forest cantons of Switzerland against Austria and the Battle of
Morgarten which took place in 1315 in such and
such a way (a page of quotations from Engels with the appropriate comments
from Kautsky); that Lassalle regarded the peasant war in Germany of the
sixteenth century as reactionary, etc.  

It  cannot be said that these remarks and quotations have any novelty
about them, but at all events it is interesting for the reader to be
occasionally reminded just how Marx, Engels and Lassalle approached the
analysis of concrete historical problems in individual countries. And a
perusal of these instructive quotations from Marx and Engels reveals most
strikingly the ridiculous position Rosa Luxemburg has placed herself in,
she preaches eloquently and

 

angrily the need for a concrete historical analysis of the national
question in different countries at different times, but she does not
make the least attempt to determine what historical stage in
the development of capitalism Russia is passing through at the
beginning of the twentieth century, or what the specific features
of the national question in this country are. Rosa Luxemburg gives examples
of how others have treated the question in a Marxist fashion, as
if deliberately stressing how often the road to hell is paved with good
intentions and how often good counsel covers up unwillingness or inability
to follow such advice in practice.  

Here  is one of her edifying comparisons. In protesting against the
demand for the independence of Poland, Rosa Luxemburg refers to a pamphlet
she wrote in 1898, proving the rapid “industrial development of Poland”,
with the latter’s manufactured goods being marketed in Russia. Needless to
say, no conclusion whatever can be drawn from this on the question of the
right to self-determination; it only proves the disappearance of
the old Poland of the landed gentry, etc. But Rosa Luxemburg always passes
on imperceptibly to the conclusion that among the factors that unite Russia
and Poland, the purely economic factors of modern capitalist relations now
predominate.  

Then  our Rosa proceeds to the question of autonomy, and though her
article is entitled “The National Question and Autonomy” in
general, she begins to argue that the Kingdom of Poland has an
exclusive right to autonomy (see Prosveshcheniye, 1913,
No. 12[1]).

To support Poland’s right to autonomy, Rosa Luxemburg evidently judges the
state system of Russia by her economic, political and sociological
characteristics and everyday life—a totality of features which, taken
together, produce the concept of “Asiatic
despotism”. (Przeglad No. 12, p. 137.)  

It  is generally known that this kind of state system possesses great
stability whenever completely patriarchal and pre-capitalist features
predominate in the economic system and where commodity production and class
differentiation are scarcely developed. However, if in a country

 

whose state system is distinctly pre-capitalist in character there
exists a nationally demarcated region where capitalism is rapidly
developing, then the more rapidly that capitalism develops, the greater
will be the antagonism between it and the pre-capitalist state system, and
the more likely will be the separation of the progressive region from the
whole—with which it is connected, not by “modern capitalistic”, but by
“Asiatically despotic” ties.  

Thus,  Rosa Luxemburg does not get her arguments to hang together even
on the question of the social structure of the government in Russia with
regard to bourgeois Poland; as for the concrete, historical, specific
features of the national movements in Russia—she does not even raise that
question.  

That  is a point we must now deal with.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



3. THE CONCRETE FEATURES OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION IN
RUSSIA, AND RUSSIA’S BOURGEOIS-DEMOCRATIC REFORMATION


   “Despite  the elasticity of the principle of ‘the right
   of nations to self-determination’, which is a mere platitude, and,
   obviously, equally applicable, not only to the nations inhabiting Russia,
   but also to the nations inhabiting Germany and Austria, Switzerland and
   Sweden, America and Australia, we do not find it in the programmes of any
   of the present-day socialist parties....” (Przeglad
   No. 6, p. 483.)  


This  is how Rosa Luxemburg opens her attack upon §9 of the Marxist
programme. In trying to foist on us the conception that this clause in the
programme is a “mere platitude”, Rosa Luxemburg herself falls victim to
this error, alleging with amusing boldness that this point is, “obviously,
equally applicable” to Russia, Germany, etc.  

Obviously,  we shall reply, Rosa Luxemburg has decided to make her
article a collection, of errors in logic that could be used for schoolboy
exercises. For Rosa Luxemburg’s tirade is sheer nonsense and a mockery of
the historically concrete presentation of the question.  

If  one interprets the Marxist programme in Marxist fashion, not in a
childish way, one will without difficulty grasp the fact that it refers to
bourgeois-democratic national movements. That being the case, it is
“obvious” that this

 

programme “sweepingly”, and as a “mere platitude”, etc., covers
all instances of bourgeois-democratic national movements. No less
obvious to Rosa Luxemburg, if she gave the slightest thought to it, is the
conclusion that our programme refers only to cases where such a
movement is actually in existence.  

Had  she given thought to these obvious considerations, Rosa Luxemburg
would have easily perceived what non sense she was talking. In accusing
us of uttering a “platitude” she has used against us
the argument that no mention is made of the right to self-determination in
the programmes of countries where there are no bourgeois-democratic
national movements. A remarkably clever argument!  

A  comparison of the political and economic development of various
countries, as well as of their Marxist programmes, is of tremendous
importance from the standpoint of Marxism, for there can be no doubt that
all modern states are of a common capitalist nature and are therefore
subject to a common law of development. But such a comparison must be drawn
in a sensible way. The elementary condition for comparison is to find out
whether the historical periods of development of the countries concerned
are at all comparable. For instance, only absolute ignoramuses
(such as Prince Y. Trubetskoi in Russkaya Mysl) are capable of
“comparing” the Russian Marxists’ agrarian programme with the programmes
of Western Europe, since our programme replies to questions that concern
the bourgeois-democratic agrarian reform, whereas in the Western
countries no such question arises.  

The  same applies to the national question. In most Western countries it
was settled long ago. It is ridiculous to seek an answer to non-existent
questions in the programmes of Western Europe. In this respect Rosa
Luxemburg has lost sight of the most important thing—the difference
between countries, where bourgeois-democratic reforms have long been
completed, and those where they have not.  

The  crux of the matter lies in this difference. Rosa Luxemburg’s
complete disregard of it transforms her verbose article into a collection
of empty and meaningless platitudes.  

The  epoch of bourgeois-democratic revolutions in Western, continental
Europe embraces a fairly definite period,

 

approximately between 1789 and 1871. This was precisely the period of
national movements and the creation of national states. When this period
drew to a close, Western Europe had been transformed into a settled system
of bourgeois states, which, as a general rule, were nationally uniform
states. Therefore, to seek the right to self-determination in the
programmes of West-European socialists at this time of day is to betray
one’s ignorance of the ABC of Marxism.  

In  Eastern Europe and Asia the period of bourgeois-democratic
revolutions did not begin until 1905. The revolutions in Russia, Persia,
Turkey and China, the Balkan wars—such is the chain of world events of
our period in our “Orient”. And only a blind man could fail to
see in this chain of events the awakening of a whole series of
bourgeois-democratic national movements which strive to create nationally
independent and nationally uniform states. It is precisely and solely
because Russia and the neighbouring countries are passing through this
period that we must have a clause in our programme on the right of nations
to self-determination.  

But  let us continue the quotation from Rosa Luxemburg’s article a
little more. She writes: 


   “In  particular, the programme of a party which is operating in a state
   with an extremely varied national composition, and for which the national
   question is a matter of first-rate importance—the programme of the
   Austrian Social-Democratic Party—does not contain the principle of the
   right of nations to self-determination.” (Ibid.)  


Thus,  an attempt is made to convince the reader by the example of
Austria “in particular”. Let us examine this example in the light of
concrete historical facts and see just how sound it is.  

In  the first place, let us pose the fundamental question of the
completion of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. In Austria, this
revolution began in 1848 and was over in 1867. Since then, a more or less
fully established bourgeois constitution has dominated, for nearly half a
century, and on its basis a legal workers’ party is legally functioning.


Therefore,  in the internal conditions of Austria’s development (i. e.,
from the standpoint of the development of capitalism in Austria in general,
and among its various nations in particular), there are no factors
that produce

 

leaps and bounds, a concomitant of which might be the formation of
nationally independent states. In assuming, by her comparison, that Russia
is in an analogous position in this respect, Rosa Luxemburg not only makes
a fundamentally erroneous and anti-historical assumption, but also
involuntarily slips into liquidationism.  

Secondly,  the profound difference in the relations between the
nationalities in Austria and those in Russia is particularly important for
the question we are concerned with. Not only was Austria for a long time a
state in which the Germans preponderated, but the Austrian Germans laid
claim to hegemony in the German nation as a whole. This “claim”, as Rosa
Luxemburg (who is seemingly so averse to commonplaces, platitudes,
abstractions...) will perhaps be kind enough to remember, was shattered in
the war of 1866. The German nation predominating in Austria found itself
outside the pale of the independent German state which finally
took shape in 1871. On the other hand, the Hungarians’ attempt to create an
independent national state collapsed under the blows of the Russian serf
army as far back as 1849.  

A  very peculiar situation was thus created—a striving on the part of
the Hungarians and then of the Czechs, not for separation from Austria,
but, on the contrary, for the preservation of Austria’s integrity,
precisely in order to preserve national independence, which might have been
completely crushed by more rapacious and powerful neighbours! Owing to this
peculiar situation, Austria assumed the form of a dual state, and she is
now being transformed into a triple state (Germans, Hungarians, Slays).


Is  there anything like this in Russia? Is there in our country a
striving of the “subject peoples” for unity with the Great Russians in
face of the danger of worse national oppression?  

One  need only pose this question in order to see that the comparison
between Russia and Austria on the question of self-determination of nations
is meaningless, platitudinous and ignorant.  

The  peculiar conditions in Russia with regard to the national question
are just the reverse of those we see in Austria. Russia is a state with a
single national centre—

 

Great Russia. The Great Russians occupy a vast, unbroken stretch of
territory, and number about 70,000,000. The specific features of this
national state are: first, that “subject peoples” (which, on the whole,
comprise the majority of the entire population—57 per cent) inhabit the
border regions; secondly, the oppression of these subject peoples is much
stronger here than in the neighbouring states (and not even in the European
states alone); thirdly, in a number of cases the oppressed nationalities
inhabiting the border regions have compatriots across the border, who enjoy
greater national independence (suffice it to mention the Finns, the Swedes,
the Poles, the Ukrainians and the Rumanians along the western and southern
frontiers of the state); fourthly, the development of capitalism and the
general level of culture are often higher in the non-Russian border regions
than in the centre. Lastly, it is in the neighbouring Asian states that we
see the beginning of a phase of bourgeois revolutions and national
movements which are spreading to some of the kindred nationalities within
the borders of Russia.  

Thus,  it is precisely the special concrete, historical features of the
national question in Russia that make the recognition of the right of
nations to self-determination in the present period a matter of special
urgency in our country.  

Incidentally,  even from the purely factual angle, Rosa Luxemburg’s
assertion that the Austrian Social-Democrats’ programme does not contain
any recognition of the right of nations to self-determination is
incorrect. We need only open the Minutes of the Brünn Congress, which
adopted the national

programme,[1] to find the statements by the Ruthenian Social-Democrat
Hankiewicz on behalf of the entire Ukrainian (Ruthenian) delegation (p. 85
of the Minutes), and by the Polish Social-Democrat Reger on behalf of the
entire Polish delegation (p. 108), to the effect that one of the
aspirations of the Austrian Social-Democrats of both the above-mentioned
nations is to secure national unity, and the freedom and independence of
their nations. Hence, while the Austrian Social-Democrats did not include
the right of nations to self-determination directly in their programme,
they did nevertheless allow the demand for national independence to be
advanced by sections of the

 

party. In effect, this means, of course, the recognition of the right of
nations to self-determination! Thus, Rosa Luxemburg’s reference to Austria
speaks against Rosa Luxemburg in all respects.

## Practicality




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 4. 'PRACTICALITY' IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



4. “PRACTICALITY” IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION

Rosa  Luxemburg’s argument that §9 of our Programme contains
nothing “practical” has been seized upon by the opportunists. Rosa
Luxemburg is so delighted with this argument that in some parts of her
article this “slogan” is repeated eight times on a single page.  

She  writes: §9 “gives no practical lead on the day-by-day policy
of the proletariat, no practical solution of national problems”.  

Let  us examine this argument, which elsewhere is formulated in such a
way that it makes §9 look quite meaningless, or else commits us to
support all national aspirations.  

What  does the demand for “practicality” in the national question
mean?  

It  means one of three things: support for all national aspirations; the
answer “yes” or “no” to the question of secession by any nation; or
that national demands are in general immediately “practicable”.  

Let  us examine all three possible meanings of the demand for
“practicality”.  

The  bourgeoisie, which naturally assumes the leadership at the start of
every national movement, says that support for all national aspirations is
practical. However, the proletariat’s policy in the national question (as
in all others) supports the bourgeoisie only in a certain direction, but it
never coincides with the bourgeoisie’s policy. The working class supports
the bourgeoisie only in order to secure national peace (which the
bourgeoisie cannot bring about completely and which can be achieved only
with complete democracy), in order to secure equal rights and to
create the best conditions for the class struggle. Therefore, it is in
opposition to the practicality of the bourgeoisie that the
proletarians advance their principles in the national question;
they always give the bourgeoisie only conditional support. What
every bourgeoisie is out for in the national

 

question is either privileges for its own nation, or exceptional
advantages for it; this is called being “practical”. The proletariat is
opposed to all privileges, to all exclusiveness. To demand that it should
be “practical” means following the lead of the bourgeoisie, falling into
opportunism.  

The  demand for a “yes” or “no” reply to the question of secession
in the case of every nation may seem a very “practical” one. In reality
it is absurd; it is metaphysical in theory, while in practice it leads to
subordinating the proletariat to the bourgeoisie’s policy. The bourgeoisie
always places its national demands in the forefront, and does so in
categorical fashion. With the proletariat, however, these demands are
subordinated to the interests of the class struggle. Theoretically, you
cannot say in advance whether the bourgeois-democratic revolution will end
in a given nation seceding from another nation, or in its equality with the
latter; in either case, the important thing for the proletariat is
to ensure the development of its class. For the bourgeoisie it is important
to hamper this development by pushing the aims of its “own” nation before
those of the proletariat. That is why the proletariat confines itself, so
to speak, to the negative demand for recognition of the right to
self-determination, without giving guarantees to any nation, and without
undertaking to give anything at the expense of another nation.


This  may not be “practical”, but it is in effect the best guarantee
for the achievement of the most democratic of all possible solutions. The
proletariat needs only such guarantees, whereas the bourgeoisie of
every nation requires guarantees for its own interest, regardless
of the position of (or the possible disadvantages to) other nations.  

The  bourgeoisie is most of all interested in the “feasibility” of a
given demand—hence the invariable policy of coming to terms with the
bourgeoisie of other nations, to the detriment of the proletariat. For the
proletariat, however, the important thing is to strengthen its class
against the bourgeoisie and to educate the masses in the spirit of
consistent democracy and socialism.  

This  may not be “practical” as far as the opportunists are concerned,
but it is the only real guarantee, the guarantee

 

of the greater national equality and peace, despite the feudal landlords
and the nationalist bourgeoisie.  

The  whole task of the proletarians in the national question is
“unpractical” from the standpoint of the nationalist bourgeoisie
of every nation, because the proletarians, opposed as they are to
nationalism of every kind, demand “abstract” equality; they demand, as a
matter of principle, that there should be no privileges, however
slight. Failing to grasp this, Rosa Luxemburg, by her misguided eulogy of
practicality, has opened the door wide for the opportunists, and especially
for opportunist concessions to Great-Russian nationalism.  

Why  Great-Russian? Because the Great Russians in Russia are an
oppressor nation, and opportunism in the national question will of course
find expression among oppressed nations otherwise than among oppressor
nations.  

On  the plea that its demands are “practical”, the bourgeoisie of the
oppressed nations will call upon the proletariat to support its aspirations
unconditionally. The most practical procedure is to say a plain “yes” in
favour of the secession of a particular nation rather than in
favour of all nations having the right to secede!  

The  proletariat is opposed to such practicality. While recognising
equality and equal rights to a national state, it values above all and
places foremost the alliance of the proletarians of all nations, and
assesses any national demand, any national separation, from the
angle of the workers’ class struggle. This call for practicality is in
fact merely a call for uncritical acceptance of bourgeois aspirations.


By  supporting the right to secession, we are told, you are supporting
the bourgeois nationalism of the oppressed nations. This is what Rosa
Luxemburg says, and she is echoed by Semkovsky, the opportunist, who
incidentally is the only representative of liquidationist ideas on this
question, in the liquidationist newspaper!  

Our  reply to this is: No, it is to the bourgeoisie that a “practical”
solution of this question is important. To the workers the important thing
is to distinguish the principles of the two trends. Insofar
as the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nation fights the oppressor, we
are always, in every case,

 

and more strongly than anyone else, in favour, for we are the
staunchest and the most consistent enemies of oppression. But insofar as
the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nation stands for its own
bourgeois nationalism, we stand against. We fight against the privileges
and violence of the oppressor nation, and do not in any way condone
strivings for privileges on the part of the oppressed nation.  

If,  in our political agitation, we fail to advance and advocate the
slogan of the right to secession, we shall play into the hands,
not only of the bourgeoisie, but also of the feudal landlords and the
absolutism of the oppressor nation. Kautsky long ago used this
argument against Rosa Luxemburg, and the argument is indisputable. When, in
her anxiety not to “assist” the nationalist bourgeoisie of Poland, Rosa
Luxemburg rejects the right to secession in the programme of the
Marxists in Russia, she is in fact assisting the
Great-Russian Black Hundreds. She is in fact assisting opportunist
tolerance of the privileges (and worse than privileges) of the Great
Russians.  

Carried  away by the struggle against nationalism in Poland, Rosa
Luxemburg has forgotten the nationalism of the Great Russians, although it
is this nationalism that is the most formidable at the present
time. It is a nationalism that is mere feudal than bourgeois, and is the
principal obstacle to democracy and to the proletarian struggle. The
bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general
democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is
this content that we unconditionally support, At the same time we
strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness;
we fight against the tendency of the Polish bourgeois to oppress the Jews,
etc., etc.  

This  is “unpractical” from the standpoint of the bourgeois and the
philistine, but it is the only policy in the national question that is
practical, based on principles, and really promotes democracy, liberty and
proletarian unity.  

The  recognition of the right to secession for all; the appraisal of
each concrete question of secession from the point of view of removing all
inequality, all privileges, and all exclusiveness.  


Let  us consider the position of an oppressor nation. Can a nation be
free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot. The interests of the freedom
of the Great-Russian population[1]

require a struggle against such oppression. The long, centuries-old history
of the suppression of the movements of the oppressed nations, and the
systematic propaganda in favour of such suppression coming from the
“upper” classes have created enormous obstacles to the cause of freedom
of the Great-Russian people itself, in the form of prejudices, etc.  

The  Great-Russian Black Hundreds deliberately foster these prejudices
and encourage them. The Great-Russian bourgeoisie tolerates or condones
them. The Great-Russian proletariat cannot achieve its own aims or
clear the road to its freedom without systematically countering these
prejudices.  

In  Russia, the creation of an independent national state remains, for
the time being, the privilege of the Great-Russian nation alone. We, the
Great-Russian proletarians, who defend no privileges whatever, do not
defend this privilege either. We are fighting on the ground of a definite
state; we unite the workers of all nations living in this state; we cannot
vouch for any particular path of national development, for we are marching
to our class goal along all possible paths.  

However,  we cannot move towards that goal unless we combat all
nationalism, and uphold the equality of the various nations. Whether the
Ukraine, for example, is destined to form an independent state is a matter
that will be determined by a thousand unpredictable factors. Without
attempting idle “guesses”, we firmly uphold something that is
beyond doubt: the right of the Ukraine to form such a state. We respect
this right; we do not uphold the privileges of Great Russians with regard
to Ukrainians; we educate the masses in the spirit of recognition
of that right, in the spirit of rejecting state privileges for any
nation.  


In  the leaps which all nations have made in the period of bourgeois
revolutions, clashes and struggles over the right to a national state are
possible and probable. We proletarians declare in advance that we are
opposed to Great-Russian privileges, and this is what guides our
entire propaganda and agitation.  

In  her quest for “practicality” Rosa Luxemburg has lost sight of the
principal practical task both of the Great-Russian proletariat and
of the proletariat of other nationalities:
that of day-by-day agitation and propaganda against all state and national
privileges, and for the right, the equal right of all nations, to their
national state. This (at present) is cut principal task in the national
question, for only in this way can we defend the interests of democracy and
the alliance of all proletarians of all nations on an equal footing.  

This  propaganda may be “unpractical” from the point of view of the
Great-Russian oppressors, as well as from the point of view of the
bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations (both demand a definite
“yes” or “no”, and accuse the Social-Democrats of being “vague”). In
reality it is this propaganda, and this propaganda alone, that ensures the
genuinely democratic, the genuinely socialist education of the masses. This
is the only propaganda to ensure the greatest chances of national peace in
Russia, should she remain a multi-national state, and the most peaceful
(and for the proletarian class struggle, harmless) division into separate
national states, should the question of such a division arise.  

To  explain this policy—the only proletarian policy—in the national
question more concretely, we shall examine the attitude of Great-Russian
liberalism towards the “self-determination of nations”, and the example
of Norway’s secession from Sweden.

## Liberal
      Bourgeoisie and the Socialist Opportunists




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 5. THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE AND THE SOCIALIST OPPORTUNISTS IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



5. THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE AND THE SOCIALIST OPPORTUNISTS
IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION

We  have seen that the following argument is one of Rosa Luxemburg’s
“trump cards” in lies struggle against the programme of the Marxists in
Russia: recognition of the right

 

to self-determination is tantamount to supporting the bourgeois nationalism
of the oppressed nations. On the other hand, she says, if we take this
right to mean no more than combating all violence against other nations,
there is no need for a special clause in the programme, for
Social-Democrats are, in general, opposed to all national oppression and
inequality.  

The  first argument, as Kautsky irrefutably proved nearly twenty years
ago, is a case of blaming other people for one’s own nationalism; in her
fear of the nationalism of the bourgeoisie of oppressed nations, Rosa
Luxemburg is actually playing into the hands of the Black-Hundred
nationalism of the Great Russians! Her second argument is actually a timid
evasion of the question whether or not recognition of national equality
includes recognition of the right to secession. If it does, then Rosa
Luxemburg admits that, in principle, §9 of our Programme is
correct. If it does not, then she does not recognise national
equality. Shuffling and evasions will not help matters here!  

However,  the best way to test these and all similar arguments is to
study the attitude of the various classes of society towards this
question. For the Marxist this test is obligatory. We must proceed from
what is objective; we must examine the relations between the classes on
this point. In failing to do so, Rosa Luxemburg is guilty of those very
sins of metaphysics, abstractions, platitudes, and sweeping statements,
etc., of which she vainly tries to accuse her opponents.  

We  are discussing the Programme of the Marxists in Russia,
i.e., of the Marxists of all the nationalities in Russia. Should we not
examine the position of the ruling classes of Russia?  

The  position of the “bureaucracy” (we beg pardon for this inaccurate
term) and of the feudal landlords of our united-nobility type is well
known. They definitely reject both the equality of nationalities and the
right to self determination. Theirs is the old motto of the days of
serfdom: autocracy, orthodoxy, and the national essence—the last term
applying only to the Great-Russian nation. Even the Ukrainians are declared
to be an “alien” people and their very language is being suppressed.



Let  us glance at the Russian bourgeoisie, which was “called upon” to
take part—a very modest part, it is true, but nevertheless some part—in
the government, under the “June Third” legislative and administrative
system. It will not need many words to prove that the Octobrists are
following the Rights in this question. Unfortunately, some Marxists pay
much less attention to the stand of the Great-Russian liberal bourgeoisie,
the Progressists and the Cadets. Yet he who fails to study that stand and
give it careful thought will inevitably flounder in abstractions and
groundless statements in discussing the question of the right of nations to
self-determination.  

Skilled  though it is in the art of diplomatically evading direct
answers to “unpleasant” questions, Rech, the principal organ of
the Constitutional-Democratic Party, was compelled, in its controversy with
Pravda last year, to make certain valuable admissions. The trouble
started over the All-Ukraine Students’ Congress held in Lvov in the summer
of
1913.[4] Mr. Mogilyansky, the “Ukrainian expert” or Ukrainian
correspondent of Rech, wrote an article in which he poured
vitriolic abuse (“ravings”, “adventurism”, etc.) on the idea that the
Ukraine should secede, an idea which Dontsov, a nationalist-socialist, had
advocated and the above-mentioned congress approved.  

While  in no way identifying itself with Mr. Dontsov, and declaring
explicitly that he was a nationalist-socialist and that many Ukrainian
Marxists did not agree with him, Rabochaya Pravda stated that the
tone of Rech, or, rather, the way it formulated the
question in principle, was improper and reprehensible for a
Great-Russian democrat, or for anyone desiring to pass as a
      democrat.[1]

Let Rech repudiate the Dontsovs if it likes, but, from the
standpoint of principle, a Great-Russian organ of democracy, which it
claims to be, cannot be oblivious of the freedom to secede, the
right to secede.  

A  few months later, Rech, No. 331, published an
“explanation” from Mr. Mogilyansky, who had learned from the Ukrainian
newspaper
Shlyakhi,[5] published in Lvov, of Mr. Dontsov’s reply, in
which, incidentally, Dontsov

 

stated that “the chauvinist attacks in Rech have been properly
sullied [branded?] only in the Russian Social-Democratic press”. This
“explanation” consisted of the thrice-repeated statement that “criticism
of Mr. Dontsov’s recipes” “has nothing in common with the repudiation of
the right of nations to self-determination”.  


   “It  must be said,” wrote Mr. Mogilyansky, “that even
   ‘the right of nations to self-determination’ is not a fetish [mark this!]
   beyond criticism: unwholesome conditions in the life of nations may give
   rise to unwholesome tendencies in national self-determination, and the fact
   that these are brought to light does not mean that the right of nations to
   self-determination has been rejected.”  


As  you see, this liberal’s talk of a “fetish” was quite in keeping
with Rosa Luxemburg’s. It was obvious that Mr. Mogilyansky was trying to
evade a direct reply to the question whether or not he recognised the right
to political self-determination, i. e., to secession.  

The  newspaper Proletarskaya Pravda, issue No. 4, for
December 11, 1913, also put this question point-blank to
Mr. Mogilyansky and to the Constitutional-Democratic
   Party.[2]


Thereupon  Rech (No. 340) published an unsigned, i.e.,
official, editorial statement replying to this question. This reply boils
down to the following three points: 

1)
§11 of  the Constitutional-Democratic Party’s programme speaks bluntly,
precisely and clearly of the “right of nations to free cultural
self-determination”.  

2)
Rech  affirms that Proletarskaya Pravda “hopelessly
confuses” self-determination with separatism, with the secession of a
given nation.  

3)
“Actually,  the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the
right of ‘nations to secede’ from the Russian state.” (See the
article “National-Liberalism and the Right of Nations to
Self-Determination”, in Proletarskaya Pravda No. 12, December 20,
1913.[3]

)



Let  us first consider the second point in the Rech
statement. How strikingly it shows to the Semkovskys, Liebmans, Yurkeviches
and other opportunists that the hue and cry

 

they have raised about the alleged “vagueness”, or “indefiniteness”, of
the term “self-determination” is in fact, i. e., from the
standpoint of objective class relationships and the class struggle in
Russia, simply a rehash of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie’s
utterances!  

Proletarskaya  Pravda put the following three
questions to the enlightened “Constitutional-Democratic” gentlemen of
Rech:
(1) do they deny that, throughout the entire history of international
democracy, and especially since the middle of the nineteenth
century, self-determination of nations has been understood to mean precisely
political self-determination, the right to form an independent national
state?
(2) do they deny that the well-known resolution adopted by the
International Socialist Congress in London in 1896 has the same meaning?
and
(3) do they deny that Plekhanov, in writing about self-determination as far
back as 1902, meant precisely political self-determination? When
Proletarskaya Pravda posed these three questions, the Cadets
fell silent!  

Not  a word did they utter in reply, for they had nothing to say. They
had to admit tacitly that Proletarskaya Pravda was absolutely
right.  

The  liberals’ outcries that the term “self-determination” is vague
and that the Social-Democrats “hopelessly confuse” it with separatism are
nothing more than attempts to confuse the issue, and evade
recognition of a universally established democratic principle. If the
Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches were not so ignorant, they would be
ashamed to address the Workers in a liberal vein.  

But  to proceed. Proletarskaya Pravda compelled Rech
to admit that, in the programme of the Constitutional-Democrats, the term
“cultural” self-determination means in effect the repudiation of
political self-determination.  

“Actually,  the Cadets have never pledged themselves to advocate the
right of ‘nations to secede’ from the Russian state”—it was not without
reason that Proletarskaya Pravda recommended to Novoye
Vremya and Zemshchina these words from Rech as an
example of our Cadets’ “loyalty”. In its issue No. 13563, Novoye
Vremya, which never, of course, misses an opportunity of mentioning
“the Yids” and taking digs at the Cadets, nevertheless stated: 



   “What,  to the Social-Democrats, is an axiom of political
   wisdom [i.e., recognition of the right of nations to self-determination,
   to secede], is today beginning to cause disagreement even among the
   Cadets.”  


By  declaring that they “have never pledged themselves to advocate the
right of nations to secede from the Russian state”, the Cadets have, in
principle, taken exactly the same stand as Novoye Vremya. This is
precisely one of the fundamentals of Cadet national-liberalism, of
their kinship with the Purishkeviches, and of their dependence, political,
ideological and practical, on the latter. Proletarskaya Pravda
wrote: “The Cadets have studied history and know only too well what—to
put it mildly—pogrom-like actions the practice of the ancient right of
the Purishkeviches to ‘grab ’em and hold ’em’ has often led to.” Although
perfectly aware of the feudalist source and nature of the Purishkeviches’
omnipotence; the Cadets are, nevertheless, taking their stand on the
basis of the relationships and frontiers created by that very
class. Knowing full well that there is much in the relationships and
frontiers created or fixed by this class that is un-European and
anti-European (we would say Asiatic if this did not sound undeservedly
slighting to the Japanese and Chinese), the Cadets, nevertheless, accept
them as the utmost limit.  

Thus,  they are adjusting themselves to the Purishkeviches, cringing to
them, fearing to jeopardise their position, protecting them from the
people’s movement, from the democracy. As Proletarskaya Pravda
wrote: “In effect, this means adapting oneself to the interests of the
feudal-minded landlords and to the worst nationalist prejudices of the
dominant nation, instead of systematically combating those prejudices.”


Being  men who are familiar with history and claim to be democrats, the
Cadets do not even attempt to assert that the democratic movement, which is
today characteristic of both Eastern Europe and Asia and is striving to
change both on the model of the civilised capitalist countries, is bound to
leave intact the boundaries fixed by the feudal epoch, the epoch of the
omnipotence of the Purishkeviches and the disfranchisement of wide strata
of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie.  


The  fact that the question raised in the controversy between
Proletarskaya Pravda and Rech was not merely a literary
question, but one that involved a real political issue of the day, was
proved, among other things, by the last conference of the
Constitutional-Democratic Party held on March 23–25, 1914; in the official
report of this conference in Rech (No. 83, of March 26, 1914) we
read: 


   “A  particularly lively discussion also took place on
   national problems. The Kiev deputies, who were supported by N. V. Nekrasov
   and A. M. Kolyubakin, pointed out that the national question was becoming a
   key issue, which would have to he faced up to more resolutely than
   hitherto. F. F. Kokoshkin pointed out, however [this “however” is like
   Shchedrin’s “but”—“the ears never grow higher than the forehead,
   never!”] that both the programme and past political experience demanded
   that ‘elastic formulas’ of ‘political self-determination of nationalities’
   should be handled very carefully.”  


This  most remarkable line of reasoning at the Cadet conference deserves
serious attention from all Marxists and all democrats. (We will note in
parentheses that Kievskaya Mysl, which is evidently very well
informed and no doubt presents Mr. Kokoshkin’s ideas correctly, added that,
of course, as a warning to his opponents, he laid special stress on the
danger of the “disintegration” of the state.)  

The  official report in Rech is composed with consummate
diplomatic skill designed to lift the veil as little as possible and to
conceal as much as possible. Yet, in the main, what took place at the Cadet
conference is quite clear. The liberal-bourgeois delegates, who were
familiar with the state of affairs in the Ukraine, and the “Left” Cadets
raised the question precisely of the political self-determination
of nations. Otherwise, there would have been no need for Mr. Kokoshkin to
urge that this “formula” should be “handled carefully”.  

The  Cadet programme, which was of course known to the delegates at the
Cadet conference, speaks of “cultural”, not of political
self-determination. Hence, Mr. Kokoshkin was defending the
programme against the Ukrainian delegates, and against
the Left Cadets; he was defending “cultural” self-determination as
opposed to “political” self-determination. It is perfectly clear
that in opposing “political” self-determination, in playing up the danger
of the

 

“disintegration of the state”, and in calling the formula “political
self-determination” an “elastic” one (quite in keeping with
Rosa Luxemburg!), Mr. Kokoshkin was defending Great-Russian
national-liberalism against the more “Left” or more democratic elements
of the Constitutional-Democratic Party and also against the Ukrainian
bourgeoisie.  

Mr. Kokoshkin  won the day at the Cadet conference, as is evident from
the treacherous little word “however” in the Rech report;
Great-Russian national-liberalism has triumphed among the Cadets. Will not
this victory help to clear the minds of those misguided individuals among
the Marxists in Russia who, like the Cadets, have also begun to fear the
“elastic formulas of political self-determination of nationalities”?


Let  us, “however”, examine the substance of Mr. Kokoshkin’s line of
thought. By referring to “past political experience” (i.e., evidently,
the experience of 1905, when the Great-Russian bourgeoisie took alarm for
its national privileges and scared the Cadet Party with its fears), and
also by playing up the danger of the “disintegration of the state”,
Mr. Kokoshkin showed that he understood perfectly well that political
self-determination can mean nothing else but the right to secede and form
an independent national state. The question is—how should Mr. Kokoshkin’s
fears be appraised in the light of democracy in general, and the
proletarian class struggle in particular?  

Mr. Kokoshkin  would have us believe that recognition of the right to
secession increases the danger of the “disintegration of the state”. This
is the viewpoint of Constable Mymretsov, whose motto was “grab ’em and
hold ’em”. From the viewpoint of democracy in general, the very opposite
is the case: recognition of the right to secession reduces the
danger of the “disintegration of the state”.  

Mr. Kokoshkin  argues exactly like the nationalists do. At their last
congress they attacked the Ukrainian “Mazeppists”. The Ukrainian
movement, Mr. Savenko and Co. exclaimed, threatens to weaken the ties
between the Ukraine and Russia, since Austrian Ukrainophilism is
strengthening the Ukrainians’ ties with Austria! It remains unexplained why
Russia cannot try to “strengthen” her ties with the

 

Ukrainians through the same method that the Savenkos blame Austria
for using, i.e., by granting the Ukrainians freedom to use their own
language, self-government and an autonomous Diet.  

The  arguments of the Savenkos and Kokoshkins are exactly alike, and
from the purely logical point of view they are equally ridiculous and
absurd. Is it not clear that the more liberty the Ukrainian nationality
enjoys in any particular country, the stronger its ties with that country
will be? One would think that this truism could not be disputed without
totally abandoning all the premises of democracy. Can there be greater
freedom of nationality, as such, than the freedom to secede, the freedom to
form an independent national state?  

To  clear up this question, which has been so confused by the liberals
(and by those who are so misguided, as to echo them), we shall cite a very
simple example. Let us take the question of divorce. In her article Rosa
Luxemburg writes that the centralised democratic state, while conceding
autonomy to its constituent parts, should retain the most important
branches of legislation, including legislation on divorce, under the
jurisdiction of the central parliament. The concern that the central
authority of the democratic state should retain the power to allow divorce
can be readily understood. The reactionaries are opposed to freedom of
divorce; they say that it must be “handled carefully”, and loudly declare
that it means the “disintegration of the family”. The democrats, however,
believe that the reactionaries are hypocrites, and that they are actually
defending the omnipotence of the police and the bureaucracy, the privileges
of one of the sexes, and the worst kind of oppression of women. They
believe that in actual fact freedom of divorce will not cause the
“disintegration” of family ties, but, on the contrary, will strengthen
them on a democratic basis, which is the only possible and durable basis in
civilised society.  

To  accuse those who support freedom of self-determination, i. e.,
freedom to secede, of encouraging separatism, is as foolish and
hypocritical as accusing those who advocate freedom of divorce of
encouraging the destruction of family ties. Just as in bourgeois society
the defenders of privilege

 

and corruption, on which bourgeois marriage rests, oppose freedom of
divorce, so, in the capitalist state, repudiation of the right to
self-determination, i. e., the right of nations to secede, means nothing
more than defence of the privileges of the dominant nation and police
methods of administration, to the detriment of democratic methods.  

No  doubt, the political chicanery arising from all the relationships
existing in capitalist society sometimes leads members of parliament and
journalists to indulge in frivolous and even nonsensical twaddle about one
or another nation seceding. But only reactionaries can allow themselves to
be frightened (or pretend to be frightened) by such talk. Those who stand
by democratic principles, i.e., who insist that questions of state be
decided by the mass of the population, know very well that there is a
“tremendous
distance”[6] between what the politicians prate about and what the
people decide. From their daily experience the masses know perfectly well
the value of geographical and economic ties and the advantages of a big
market and a big state. They will, therefore, resort to secession only when
national oppression and national friction make joint life absolutely
intolerable and hinder any and all economic intercourse. In that case, the
interests of capitalist development and of the freedom of the class
struggle will be best served by secession.  

Thus,  from whatever angle we approach Mr. Kokoshkin’s arguments, they
prove to be the height of absurdity and a mockery of the principles of
democracy. And yet there is a modicum of logic in these arguments, the
logic of the class interests of the Great-Russian bourgeoisie. Like most
members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, Mr. Kokoshkin is a lackey
of the money-bags of that bourgeoisie. He defends its privileges in
general, and its state privileges in particular. He defends them
hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with Purishkevich, the only
difference being that Purishkevich puts more faith in the feudalist cudgel,
while Kokoshkin and Co. realise that this cudgel was badly damaged in 1905,
and rely more on bourgeois methods of fooling the masses, such as
frightening the petty bourgeoisie and the peasants with the spectre of the
“disintegration of the state”, and deluding them with phrases

 

about blending “people’s freedom” with historical tradition, etc.  

The  liberals’ hostility to the principle of political
self-determination of nations can have one, and only one, real class
meaning: national-liberalism, defence of the state privileges of the
Great-Russian bourgeoisie. And the opportunists among the Marxists in
Russia, who today, under the Third of June regime, are against the right of
nations to self-determination—the liquidator Semkovsky, the Bundist
Liebman, the Ukrainian petty-bourgeois Yurkevich—are actually
following in the wake of the national-liberals, and corrupting the working
class with national-liberal ideas.  

The  interests of the working class and of its struggle against
capitalism demand complete solidarity and the closest unity of the workers
of all nations; they demand resistance to the nationalist policy of the
bourgeoisie of every nationality. Hence, Social-Democrats would be
deviating from proletarian policy and subordinating the workers to the
policy of the bourgeoisie if they were to repudiate the right of nations to
self-determination, i.e., the right of an oppressed nation to secede, or
if they were to support all the national demands of the bourgeoisie of
oppressed nations. It makes no difference to the hired worker whether he is
exploited chiefly by the Great-Russian bourgeoisie rather than the
non-Russian bourgeoisie, or by the Polish bourgeoisie rather than the
Jewish bourgeoisie, etc. The hired worker who has come to understand his
class interests is equally indifferent to the state privileges of the
Great-Russian capitalists and to the promises of the Polish or Ukrainian
capitalists to set up an earthly paradise when they obtain state
privileges. Capitalism is developing and will continue to develop, anyway,
both in integral states with a mixed population and in separate national
states.  

In  any case the hired worker will be an object of
exploitation. Successful struggle against exploitation requires that the
proletariat be free of nationalism, and be absolutely neutral, so to speak,
in the fight for supremacy that is going on among the bourgeoisie of the
various nations. If the proletariat of any one nation gives the slightest
support to the privileges of its “own” national bourgeoisie, that will
inevitably rouse distrust among the proletariat of

 

another nation; it will weaken the international class solidarity of the
workers and divide them, to the delight of the bourgeoisie. Repudiation of
the right to self-determination or to secession inevitably means, in
practice, support for the privileges of the dominant nation.  

We  will get even more striking confirmation of this if we take the
concrete case of Norway’s secession from Sweden.

## Norway's Secession




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 6. NORWAY'S SECESSION  SWEDEN








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



6. NORWAY’S SECESSION  SWEDEN

Rosa  Luxemburg cites precisely this example, and discusses it as
follows: 


   “The  latest event in the history of federative
   relations, the secession of Norway from Sweden—which at the time was
   hastily seized upon by the social-patriotic Polish press (see the Cracow
   Naprzod[2]) as a gratifying sign of the strength and
   progressive nature of the tendency towards state secession—at once
   provided striking proof that federalism and its concomitant, separation,
   are in no way an expression of progress or democracy. After the so-called
   Norwegian ‘revolution’, which meant that the Swedish king was deposed and
   compelled to leave Norway, the Norwegians coolly proceeded to choose
   another king, formally rejecting, by a national referendum, the proposal to
   establish a republic. That which superficial admirers of all national
   movements and of all semblance of independence proclaimed to be a
   ‘revolution’ was simply a manifestation of peasant and petty-bourgeois
   particularism, the desire to have a king ‘of their own’ for their money
   instead of one imposed upon them by the Swedish aristocracy, and was,
   consequently, a movement that had absolutely nothing in common with
   revolution. At the same time, the dissolution of the union between Sweden
   and Norway showed once more to what extent, in this case also, the
   federation which had existed until then was only an expression of purely
   dynastic interests and, therefore, merely a form of monarchism and
   reaction.” (Przeglad.)  


That  is literally all that Rosa Luxemburg has to say on this score!
Admittedly, it would have been difficult for her to have revealed the
hopelessness of her position more saliently than she has done in this
particular instance.  

The  question was, and is: do the Social-Democrats in a mixed national
state need a programme that recognises the right to self-determination or
secession?  

What  does the example of Norway, cited by Rosa Luxemburg, tell us on
this point?  

Our  author twists and turns, exercises her wit and rails at
Naprzod, but she does not answer the question! Rosa

 

Luxemburg speaks about everything under the sun so as to avoid saying a
single word about the actual point at issue!  

Undoubtedly,  in wishing to have a king of their own for their money,
and in rejecting, in a national referendum, the proposal to establish a
republic, the Norwegian petty bourgeoisie displayed exceedingly bad
philistine qualities. Undoubtedly, Naprzod displayed
equally bad and equally philistine qualities in failing to notice this.


But  what has all this to do with the case?  

The  question under discussion was the right of nations to
self-determination and the attitude to be adopted by the socialist
proletariat towards this right!  Why, then, does not Rosa Luxemburg answer
this question instead of beating about the bush?  

To  a mouse there is no stronger beast than the cat, it is said. To Rosa
Luxemburg there is evidently no stronger beast than the
“Fracy”. “Fracy” is the popular term for the “Polish Socialist
Party”, its so-called revolutionary section, and the Cracow newspaper
Naprzod shares the views of that “section”. Rosa
Luxemburg is so blinded by her fight against the nationalism of that
“section” that she loses sight of everything except
Naprzod.  

If  Naprzod says “yes”, Rosa Luxemburg considers it
her sacred duty to say an immediate “no”, without stopping to think that
by so doing she does not reveal independence of Naprzod,
but, on the contrary, her ludicrous dependence on the “Fracy” and her
inability to see things from a view point any deeper and broader than that
of the Cracow ant hill. Naprzod, of course, is a wretched
and by no means Marxist organ; but that should not prevent us from properly
analysing the example of Norway, once we have chosen it.  

To  analyse this example in Marxist fashion, we must deal, not with the
vices of the awfully terrible “Fracy”, but, first, with the concrete
historical features of the secession of Norway from Sweden, and secondly,
with the tasks which confronted the proletariat of both countries
in connection with this secession.  

The  geographic, economic and language ties between Norway and Sweden
are as intimate as those between the Great Russians and many other Slav
nations. But the union between Norway and Sweden was not a voluntary one,
and

 

in dragging in the question of “federation” Rosa Luxemburg was talking at
random, simply because she did not know what to say. Norway was
ceded to Sweden by the monarchs during the Napoleonic wars,
against the will of the Norwegians; and the Swedes had to bring troops into
Norway to subdue her.  

Despite  the very extensive autonomy which Norway enjoyed (she had her
own parliament, etc.), there was constant friction between Norway and
Sweden for many decades after the union, and the Norwegians strove hard to
throw off the yoke of the Swedish aristocracy. At last, in August 1905,
they succeeded: the Norwegian parliament resolved that the Swedish king was
no longer king of Norway, and in the referendum held later among the
Norwegian people, the overwhelming majority (about 200,000 as against a few
hundred) voted for complete separation from Sweden. After a short period of
indecision, the Swedes resigned themselves to the fact of secession.  

This  example shows us on what grounds cases of the secession of nations
are practicable, and actually occur, under modern economic and political
relationships, and the form secession sometimes assumes under
conditions of political freedom and democracy.  

No  Social-Democrat will deny—unless he would profess indifference to
questions of political freedom and democracy (in which case he is naturally
no longer a Social-Democrat)—that this example virtually proves
that it is the bounden duty of class-conscious workers to conduct
systematic propaganda and prepare the ground for the settlement of
conflicts that may arise over the secession of nations, not in the
“Russian way”, but only in the way they were settled in 1905
between Norway and Sweden. This is exactly what is meant by the demand in
the programme for the recognition of the right of nations to
self-determination. But Rosa Luxemburg tried to get around a fact that was
repugnant to her theory by violently attacking the philistinism of the
Norwegian philistines and the Cracow Naprzod; for she
understood perfectly well that this historical fact completely
refutes her phrases about the right of nations to self-determination
being a “utopia”, or like the right “to eat off gold plates”, etc. Such
phrases only express a smug and opportunist belief in the

 

immutability of the present alignment of forces among the nationalities of
Eastern Europe.  

To  proceed. In the question of the self-determination of nations, as in
every other question, we are interested, first and foremost, in the
self-determination of the proletariat within a given nation. Rosa Luxemburg
modestly evaded this question too, for she realised that an analysis of it
on the basis of the example of Norway, which she herself had chosen, would
be disastrous to her “theory”.  

What  position did the Norwegian and Swedish proletariat take, and
indeed had to take, in the conflict over secession? After Norway
seceded, the class-conscious workers of Norway would naturally have voted
for a republic,[1]

and if some socialists voted otherwise it only goes to show how much dense,
philistine opportunism there sometimes is in the European socialist
movement. There can be no two opinions about that, and we mention the point
only because Rosa Luxemburg is trying to obscure the issue by speaking
off the mark. We do not know whether the Norwegian socialist
programme made it obligatory for Norwegian Social-Democrats to hold
particular views on the question of secession. We will assume that it did
not, and that the Norwegian socialists left it an open question as to what
extent the autonomy of Norway gave sufficient scope to wage the class
struggle freely, or to what extent the eternal friction and conflicts with
the Swedish aristocracy hindered freedom of economic life. But it cannot be
disputed that the Norwegian proletariat had to oppose this aristocracy and
support Norwegian peasant democracy (with all its philistine limitations).


And  the Swedish proletariat? It is common knowledge that the Swedish
landed proprietors, abetted by the Swedish clergy, advocated war against
Norway. Inasmuch as Norway was much weaker than Sweden, had already
experienced a Swedish invasion, and the Swedish aristocracy carries
enormous

 

weight in its own country, this advocacy of war presented a grave
danger. We may be sure that the Swedish Kokoshkins spent much time and
energy in trying to corrupt the minds of the Swedish people by appeals to
“handle” the “elastic formulas of political self-determination of
nations carefully”, by painting horrific pictures of the danger of the
“disintegration of the state” and by assuring them that “people’s
freedom” was compatible with the traditions of the Swedish
aristocracy. There cannot be the slightest doubt that the Swedish
Social-Democrats would have betrayed the cause of socialism and democracy
if they had not fought with all their might to combat both the landlord and
the “Kokoshkin” ideology and policy, and if they had failed to demand,
not only equality of nations in general (to which the Kokoshkins
also subscribe), but also the right of nations to self-determination,
Norway’s freedom to secede.  

The  close alliance between the Norwegian and Swedish workers, their
complete fraternal class solidarity, gained from the Swedish
workers’ recognition of the right of the Norwegians to secede. This
convinced the Norwegian workers that the Swedish workers were not infected
with Swedish nationalism, and that they placed fraternity with the
Norwegian proletarians above the privileges of the Swedish bourgeoisie and
aristocracy. The dissolution of the ties imposed upon Norway by the
monarchs of Europe and the Swedish aristocracy strengthened the ties
between the Norwegian and Swedish workers. The Swedish workers have proved
that in spite of all the vicissitudes of bourgeois
policy—bourgeois relations may quite possibly bring about a repetition of
the forcible subjection of the Norwegians to the Swedes!—they will be
able to preserve and defend the complete equality and class solidarity of
the workers of both nations in the struggle against both the Swedish and
the Norwegian bourgeoisie.  

Incidentally,  this reveals how groundless and even frivolous are the
attempts sometimes made by the “Fracy” to “use” our disagreements with
Rosa Luxemburg against Polish Social-Democracy. The “Fracy” are not a
proletarian or a socialist party, but a petty-bourgeois nationalist party,
something like Polish Social-Revolutionaries. There never has been, nor
could there be, any question of unity between

 

the Russian Social-Democrats and this party. On the other hand, no Russian
Social-Democrat has ever “repented” of the close relations and unity that
have been established with the Polish Social-Democrats. The Polish
Social-Democrats have rendered a great historical service by creating the
first really Marxist, proletarian party in Poland, a country imbued with
nationalist aspirations and passions. Yet the service the Polish
Social-Democrats have rendered is a great one, not because Rosa Luxemburg
has talked a lot of nonsense about §9 of the Russian Marxists’
Programme, but despite that sad circumstance.  

The  question of the “right to self-determination” is of course not so
important to the Polish Social-Democrats as it is to the Russian. It is
quite understandable that in their zeal (sometimes a little excessive,
perhaps) to combat the nationalistically blinded petty bourgeoisie of
Poland the Polish Social-Democrats should overdo things. No Russian Marxist
has ever thought of blaming the Polish Social-Democrats for being opposed
to the secession of Poland. These Social-Democrats err only when, like
Rosa Luxemburg, they try to deny the necessity of including the recognition
of the right to self-determination in the Programme of the Russian
Marxists.  

Virtually,  this is like attempting to apply relationships,
understandable by Cracow standards, to all the peoples and nations
inhabiting Russia, including the Great Russians. It means being “Polish
nationalists the wrong way round”, not Russian, not international
Social-Democrats.  

For  international Social-Democracy stands for the recognition of the
right of nations to self-determination. This is what we shall now proceed
to discuss.

Since  the majority of the Norwegian nation was in favour of a monarchy

generally speaking, confronted with the alternative: either revolution, if
conditions were ripe for it, or submission to the will of the majority and
prolonged propaganda and agitation work.  —Lenin

## London International
      Congress




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 7. THE RESOLUTION OF THE LONDON INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS, 1896








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



7. THE RESOLUTION OF THE LONDON INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS, 1896

This  resolution reads: 


   “This  Congress declares that it stands for the full
   right of all nations to self-determination
   [Selbstbestimmungsrecht] and expresses its sympathy for the
   workers of ever country now suffering under the yoke of military, national
   or other absolutism. This Congress calls upon the workers of all these
   countries to join the ranks of the class-conscious
   [Klassenbewusste—those who understand their

 

   class interests] workers of the whole world in order jointly to fight for
   the defeat of international capitalism and for the achievement of the aims
   of international
 Social-Democracy.”[1]



As  we have already pointed out, our opportunists—Semkovsky, Liebman
and Yurkevich—are simply unaware of this resolution. But Rosa Luxemburg
knows it and quotes the full text, which contains the same expression as
that contained in our programme, viz., “self-determination”.  

How  does Rosa Luxemburg remove this obstacle from the path of her
“original” theory?  

Oh,  quite simply ... the whole emphasis lies in the second part of the
resolution ... its declarative character ... one can refer to it only by
mistake!  

The  feebleness and utter confusion of our author are simply
amazing. Usually it is only the opportunists who talk about the consistent
democratic and socialist points in the programme being mere declarations,
and cravenly avoid an open debate on them. It is apparently not without
reason that Rosa Luxemburg has this time found herself in the deplorable
company of the Semkovskys, Liebmans and Yurkeviches. Rosa Luxemburg does
not venture to state openly whether she regards the above resolution as
correct or erroneous. She shifts and shuffles as if counting on the
inattentive or ill-informed reader, who forgets the first part of the
resolution by the time he has started reading the second, or who has never
heard of the discussion that took place in the socialist press
prior to the London Congress.  

Rosa  Luxemburg is greatly mistaken, however, if she imagines that, in
the sight of the class-conscious workers of Russia, she can get away with
trampling upon the resolution of the International on such an important
fundamental issue, without even deigning to analyse it critically.  

Rosa  Luxemburg’s point of view was voiced during the discussions which
took place prior to the London Congress, mainly in the columns of Die
Neue Zeit, organ of the German

 

Marxists; in essence this point of view was defeated in the
International! That is the crux of the matter, which the Russian
reader must particularly bear in mind.  

The  debate turned on the question of Poland’s independence. Three
points of view were put forward: 

1.
That  of the “Fracy”, in whose name Haecker spoke. They wanted the
International to include in its own programme a demand for the
independence of Poland. The motion was not carried and this point of view
was defeated in the International.  

2.
Rosa  Luxemburg’s point of view, viz., the Polish socialists should not
demand independence for Poland. This point of view entirely precluded the
proclamation of the right of nations to self-determination. It was likewise
defeated in the International.  

3.
The  point of view which was elaborated at the time by K. Kautsky, who
opposed Rosa Luxemburg and proved that her materialism was extremely
“one-sided”; according to Kautsky, the International could not at the
time make the independence of Poland a point in its programme; but the
Polish socialists were fully entitled to put forward such a demand. From
the socialists’ point of view it was undoubtedly a mistake to ignore the
tasks of national liberation in a situation where national oppression
existed.  

The  International’s resolution reproduces the most essential and
fundamental propositions in this point of view:
on the one hand, the absolutely direct, unequivocal recognition of the full
right of all nations to self-determination; on the other hand, the equally
unambiguous appeal to the workers for international unity in their
class struggle.  

We  think that this resolution is absolutely correct, and that, to the
countries of Eastern Europe and Asia at the beginning of the twentieth
century, it is this resolution, with both its parts being taken as an
integral whole, that gives the only correct lead to the proletarian class
policy in the national question.  

Let  us deal with the three above-mentioned viewpoints in somewhat
greater detail.  

As  is known, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels considered it the bounden
duty of the whole of West-European democracy, and still more of
Social-Democracy, to give active support to

 

the demand for Polish independence. For the period of the 1840s and 1860s,
the period of the bourgeois revolutions in Austria and Germany, and the
period of the “Peasant Reform” in
Russia,[3] this point of view was quite correct and the only one that
was consistently democratic and proletarian. So long as the masses of the
people in Russia and in most of the Slav countries were still sunk in
torpor, so long as there were no independent, mass, democratic
movements in those countries, the liberation movement of the
gentry in Poland assumed an immense and paramount importance from
the point of view, not only of Russian, not only of Slav, but of European
democracy as a
whole.[2]
[4]


But  while Marx’s standpoint was quite correct for the forties, fifties
and sixties or for the third quarter of the nineteenth century, it has
ceased to be correct by the twentieth century. Independent democratic
movements, and even an independent proletarian movement, have arisen in
most Slav countries, even in Russia, one of the most backward Slav
countries. Aristocratic Poland has disappeared, yielding place to
capitalist Poland. Under such circumstances Poland could not but lose her
exceptional revolutionary importance.  

The  attempt of the P.S.P. (the Polish Socialist Party, the present-day
“Fracy”) in 1896 to “establish” for all time the point of view Marx had
held in a different epoch was an attempt to use the
letter of Marxism against the spirit of Marxism. The
Polish Social-Democrats were therefore quite right in attacking the extreme
nationalism of the Polish petty bourgeoisie and pointing out that the
national question was of secondary importance to Polish workers, in

 

creating for the first time a purely proletarian party in Poland and
proclaiming the extremely important principle that the Polish and the
Russian workers must maintain the closest alliance in their class struggle.


But  did this mean that at the beginning of the twentieth century the
International could regard the principle of political self-determination of
nations, or the right to secede, as unnecessary to Eastern Europe and Asia?
This would have been the height of absurdity, and (theoretically)
tantamount to admitting that the bourgeois-democratic reform of the
Turkish, Russian and Chinese states had been consummated; indeed it would
have been tantamount (in practice) to opportunism, towards absolutism.


No.  At a time when bourgeois-democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe
and Asia have begun, in this period of the awakening and intensification of
national movements and of the formation of independent proletarian parties,
the task of these parties with regard to national policy must be twofold:
recognition of the right of all nations to self-determination, since
bourgeois-democratic reform is-not yet completed and since working-class
democracy consistently, seriously and sincerely (and not in a liberal,
Kokoshkin fashion) fights for equal rights for nations; then, a close,
unbreakable alliance in the class struggle of the proletarians of all
nations in a given state, throughout all the changes in its history,
irrespective of any reshaping of the frontiers of the individual states by
the bourgeoisie.  

It  is this twofold task of the proletariat that the 1896 resolution of
the International formulates. That is the substance, the underlying
principle, of the resolution adopted by the Conference of Russian Marxists
held in the summer of 1913. Some people profess to see a “contradiction”
in the fact that while point 4 of this resolution, which recognises the
right to self-determination and secession, seems to “concede” the maximum
to nationalism (in reality, the recognition of the right of all
nations to self-determination implies the maximum of democracy and
the minimum of nationalism), point 5 warns the workers against the
nationalist slogans of the bourgeoisie of any nation and demands the unity
and amalgamation of the workers of all nations in internationally united
proletarian organisations. But this is a “contradiction”

 

only for extremely shallow minds, which, for instance, cannot grasp why the
unity and class solidarity of the Swedish and the Norwegian proletariat
gained when the Swedish workers upheld Norway’s freedom to secede
and form an independent state.

It  would be a very interesting piece of historical research to compare
the position of a noble Polish rebel in 1863 with that of the all-Russia
revolutionary democrat, Chernyshevsky, who (like Marx), was able to
appreciate the importance of the Polish movement, and with that of the
Ukrainian petty bourgeois Dragomanov, who appeared much later and expressed
the views of a peasant, so ignorant and sluggish, and so attached to his
dung heap, that his legitimate hatred of the Polish gentry blinded him to
the significance which their struggle had for all-Russia
democracy. (Cf. Dragomanov, Historical Poland and Great-Russian
Democracy.) Dragomanov richly deserved the fervent kisses which were
subsequently bestowed on him by Mr. P. B. Struve, who by that time had
become a national-liberal.  —Lenin

Lenin  is referring to the Polish national liberation insurrection of
1863–64 against the yoke of the tsarist autocracy. The original cause of
the rising was the tsarist government’s decision to carry out a special
recruitment aimed at removing the revolutionary-minded youth
en masse from the cities. At first the rising was led by a Central
National Committee formed by the petty-nobles’ party of the “Reds” in
1862. Its programme demanding national independence for Poland, equal
rights for all men in the land, irrespective of religion or birth, transfer
to the peasants of the land tilled by them with full right of ownership and
without redemption payments, abolition of the corvée, compensation
for the landlords for the alienated lands out of the state funds, etc.,
attracted to the uprising diverse sections of the Polish
population—artisans, workers, students, intellectuals from among the
gentry, part of the peasantry and the clergy.  

In  the course of the insurrection, elements united around the party of
the “Whites” (the party of the big landed aristocracy and the big
bourgeoisie) joined it with the intention of using it in their own
interests and, with the help of Britain and France, securing a profitable
deal with the tsarist government.  

The  attitude of the revolutionary democrats of Russia towards the
rebels was one of deep sympathy, the members of Zemlya i Volya
secret society associated with N. G. Chernyshevsky trying to give them
every possible assistance. The Central Committee of Zemlya i Volya
issued an appeal “To the Russian Officers and Soldiers”, which was
distributed among the troops sent to suppress the
insurrection. A. I. Herzen and N. P. Ogaryov published a

   

number of articles in Kolokol devoted to the struggle of the
Polish people, and rendered material aid to the rebels.  

Owing  to the inconsistency of the party of the “Reds”, which failed
to hold the revolutionary initiative, the leadership of the uprising passed
into the hands of the “Whites”, who betrayed it. By the summer of 1864,
the insurrection was brutally crushed by the tsarist troops.  

Marx  and Engels, who regarded the Polish insurrection of 1863–64 as a
progressive movement, were fully in sympathy with it and wished the Polish
people victory in its struggle for national liberation. On behalf of the
German emigrant colony in London, Marx wrote an appeal for aid to the
Poles.

## Utopian Karl Marx
      and the Practical Rosa Luxemburg




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 8. THE UTOPIAN KARL  AND THE PRACTICAL ROSA LUXEMBURG








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



8. THE UTOPIAN KARL  AND THE PRACTICAL ROSA
LUXEMBURG

Calling  Polish independence a “utopia” and repeating this
ad nauseam, Rosa Luxemburg exclaims ironically: Why not raise the
demand for the independence of Ireland?  

The  “practical” Rosa Luxemburg evidently does not know what Karl
Marx’s attitude to the question of Irish independence was. It is worth
while dwelling upon this, so as to show how a concrete demand for
national independence was analysed from a genuinely Marxist, not
opportunist, standpoint.  

It  was Marx’s custom to “sound out” his socialist acquaintances, as
he expressed it, to test their intelligence and the strength of their
convictions.[3] After making the acquaintance of Lopatin, Marx wrote to
Engels on July 5, 1870, expressing a highly flattering opinion of the young
Russian socialist but adding at the same time: 

“Poland  is his weak point. On this point he speaks quite like
an Englishman—say, an English Chartist of the old school—about
Ireland.”[4] 

Marx  questions a socialist belonging to an oppressor nation about his
attitude to the oppressed nation and at once reveals a defect
common to the socialists of the dominant nations (the English and
the Russian): failure to understand their socialist duties towards the
downtrodden nations, their echoing of the prejudices acquired from the
bourgeoisie of the “dominant nation”.  

Before  passing on to Marx’s positive declarations on Ireland, we must
point out that in general the attitude of Marx and Engels to the national
question was strictly critical, and that they recognised its historically
conditioned importance. Thus, Engels wrote to Marx on May 23, 1851, that
the study of history was leading him to pessimistic conclusions in regard
to Poland, that the importance of Poland was

 

temporary—only until the agrarian revolution in Russia. The role of the
Poles in history was one of “bold (hotheaded) foolishness”. “And one
cannot point to a single instance in which Poland has successfully
represented progress, even in relation to Russia, or done anything at all
of historical importance.” Russia contains more of civilisation,
education, industry and the bourgeoisie than “the Poland of the indolent
gentry”. “What are Warsaw and Cracow compared to St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Odessa!” Engels had no faith in the success of the Polish gentry’s
insurrections.  

But  all these thoughts, showing the deep insight of genius, by no means
prevented Engels and Marx from treating the Polish movement with the most
profound and ardent sympathy twelve years later, when Russia was still
dormant and Poland was seething.  

When  drafting the Address of the International in 1864, Marx wrote to
Engels (on November 4, 1864) that he had to combat Mazzini’s nationalism,
and went on to say: “Inasmuch as international politics occurred in the
Address, I spoke of countries, not of nationalities, and denounced Russia,
not the minores gentium.” Marx had no doubt as to the subordinate
position of the national question as compared with the “labour
question”. But his theory is as far from ignoring national movements as
heaven is from earth.  

Then  came 1866. Marx wrote to Engels about the “Proudhonist clique”
in Paris which “declares nationalities to be an absurdity, attacks
Bismarck and Garibaldi. As polemics against chauvinism their doings are
useful and explicable. But as believers in Proudhon (Lafargue and Longuet,
two very good friends of mine here, also belong to them), who think all
Europe must and will sit quietly on their hind quarters until the gentlemen
in France abolish poverty and ignorance—they are grotesque.” (Letter of
June 7, 1866.)  

“Yesterday,”  Marx wrote on June 20, 1866, “there Was a discussion in
the International Council on the present war.... The discussion wound up,
as was to be foreseen, with ‘the question of nationality’ in general and
the attitude we take towards it.... The representatives of ‘Young France’
(non workers) came out with the announcement that all
nationalities and even nations were ‘antiquated prejudices’. Proudhonised
Stirnerism.... The whole world waits until the

 

French are ripe for a social revolution.... The English laughed very much
when I began my speech by saying that our friend Lafargue and others, who
had done away with nationalities, had spoken ‘French’ to us, i. e., a
language which nine-tenths of the audience did not understand. I also
suggested that by the negation of nationalities he appeared, quite
unconsciously, to understand their absorption by the model French nation.”


The  conclusion that follows from all these critical remarks of Marx’s
is clear: the working class should be the last to make a fetish of the
national question, since the development of capitalism does, not
necessarily awaken all nations to independent life. But to brush
aside the mass national movements once they have started, and to refuse to
support what is progressive in them means, in effect, pandering to
nationalistic prejudices, that is, recognising “one’s own
nation” as a model nation (or, we would add, one possessing the exclusive
privilege of forming a
       state).[1]


But  let us return to the question of Ireland.  

Marx’s position on this question is most clearly expressed in the
following extracts from his letters: 

“I  have done my best to bring about this demonstration of the English
workers in favour of Fenianism.... I used to think the separation of
Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable, although after
the separation there may come federation.” This is what Marx wrote to
Engels on November 2, 1867.  

In  his letter of November 30 of the same year he added: 

“...what  shall we advise the English workers? In my opinion
they must make the Repeal of the Union” [Ireland with England,
i.e., the separation of Ireland from England] (in short, the affair of
1783, only democratised and adapted to the conditions of the time) an
article of their pronunziamento. This is the only legal and
therefore only possible form of Irish emancipation which can be admitted in
the programme of an English party. Experience must show later

 

whether a mere personal union can continue to subsist between the two
countries....  

“...What  the Irish need is: 

“1)
Self-government  and independence from England; 

“2)
An  agrarian revolution....”  

Marx  attached great importance to the Irish question and delivered
hour-and-a-half lectures on this subject at the German Workers’ Union
(letter of December 17, 1867).  

In  a letter dated November 20, 1868, Engels spoke of “the hatred
towards the Irish found among the English workers”, and almost a year
later (October 24, 1869), returning to this subject, he wrote 

“Il  n’y a qu’un pas [it is only one step] from Ireland to
Russia.... Irish history shows what a misfortune it is for one nation to
have subjugated another. All the abominations of the English have their
origin in the Irish Pale. I have still to plough my way through the
Cromwellian period, but this much seems certain to me, that things would
have taken another turn in England, too, but for the necessity of military
rule in Ireland and the creation of a new aristocracy there.”  

Let  us note, in passing, Marx’s letter to Engels of August 18, 1869:


“The  Polish workers in Posen have brought a strike to a victorious end
with the help of their colleagues in Berlin. This struggle against Monsieur
le Capital—even in the lower form of the strike—is a more serious way
of getting rid of national prejudices than peace declamations from the lips
of bourgeois gentlemen.”  

The  policy on the Irish question pursued by Marx in the International
may be seen from the following: 

On  November 18, 1869, Marx wrote to Engels that he had spoken for an
hour and a quarter at the Council of the International on the question of
the attitude of the British Ministry to the Irish Amnesty, and had proposed
the following resolution: 

“Resolved,  

“that  in his reply to the Irish demands for the release of the
imprisoned Irish patriots Mr. Gladstone deliberately insults the Irish
nation; 


“that  he clogs political amnesty with conditions alike degrading to
the victims of misgovernment and the people they belong to; 

“that  having, in the teeth of his responsible position, publicly and
enthusiastically cheered on the American slave-holders’ rebellion, he now
steps in to preach to the Irish people the doctrine of passive obedience;


“that  his whole proceedings with reference to the Irish Amnesty
question are the true and genuine offspring of that ‘policy of
conquest’, by the fiery denunciation of which Mr. Gladstone ousted his
Tory rivals from office; 

“that  the General Council of the International Workingmen’s
Association express their admiration of the spirited, firm and high-souled
manner in which the Irish people carry on their Amnesty movement; 

“that  this resolution be communicated to all branches of, and
workingmen’s bodies connected with, the International Workingmen’s
Association in Europe and America.”  

On  December 10, 1869, Marx wrote that his paper on the Irish question
to be read at the Council of the International would be couched as follows:


“Quite  apart from all phrases about ‘international’ and ‘humane’
justice for Ireland—which are taken for granted in the International
Council—it is in the direct and absolute interest of the English
working class to get rid of their present connexion with Ireland. And
this is my fullest conviction; and for reasons which in part I can
not tell the English workers themselves. For a long time I
believed that it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by English
working-class ascendancy. I always expressed this point of view in the
New York
Tribune[5] [an American paper to which Marx contributed for a long
time]. Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite. The English
working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid
of Ireland.... The English reaction in England had its roots in the
subjugation of Ireland.” (Marx’s italics.)  

Marx’s  policy on the Irish question should now be quite clear to our
readers.  

Marx,  the “utopian”, was so “unpractical” that he stood for the
separation of Ireland, which half a century later has not yet been
achieved.  


What  gave rise to Marx’s policy, and was it not mistaken?  

At  first Marx thought that Ireland would not be liberated by the
national movement of the oppressed nation, but by the working-class
movement of the oppressor nation. Marx did not make an Absolute of the national movement, knowing, as he did,
that only the victory of the working class can bring about the complete
liberation of all nationalities. It is impossible to estimate beforehand
all the possible relations between the bourgeois liberation movements of
the oppressed nations and the proletarian emancipation movement of the
oppressor nation (the very problem which today makes the national question
in Russia so difficult).  

However,  it so happened that the English working class fell under the
influence of the liberals for a fairly long time, became an appendage to
the liberals, and by adopting a liberal-labour policy left itself
leaderless. The bourgeois liberation movement in Ireland grew stronger and
assumed revolutionary forms. Marx reconsidered his view and corrected
it. “What a misfortune it is for a nation to have subjugated another.”
The English working class will never be free until Ireland is freed from
the English yoke. Reaction in England is strengthened and fostered by the
enslavement of Ireland (just as reaction in Russia is fostered by her
enslavement of a number of nations!).  

And,  in proposing in the International a resolution of sympathy with
“the Irish nation”, “the Irish people” (the clever L. Vl. would
probably have berated poor Marx for forgetting about the class struggle!),
Marx advocated the separation of Ireland from England, “although
after the separation there may come federation”.  

What  were the theoretical grounds for Marx’s conclusion? In England the
bourgeois revolution had been consummated long ago. But it had not yet been
consummated in Ireland; it is being consummated only now, after the lapse
of half a century, by the reforms of the English Liberals. If capitalism
had been overthrown in England as quickly as Marx had at first expected,
there would have been no room for a bourgeois-democratic and general
national movement in Ireland. But since it had arisen, Marx advised the
English workers to support it, give it a revolutionary impetus and see it
through in the interests of their own liberty.  


The  economic ties between Ireland and England in the 1860s were of
course, even closer than Russia’s present ties with Poland, the Ukraine,
etc. The “unpracticality” and “impracticability” of the separation of
Ireland (if only owing to geographical conditions and England’s immense
colonial power) were quite obvious. Though, in principle, an enemy of
federalism, Marx in this instance granted the possibility of federation, as
well,[2]
if only the emancipation of Ireland was achieved in a
revolutionary, not reformist way, through a movement of the mass of the
people of Ireland supported by the working class of England. There can be
no doubt that only such a solution of the historical problem would have
been in the best interests of the proletariat and most conducive to rapid
social progress.  

Things  turned out differently. Both the Irish people and the English
proletariat proved weak. Only now, through the sordid deals between the
English Liberals and the Irish bourgeoisie, is the Irish problem being
solved (the example of Ulster shows with what difficulty) through the
land reform (with compensation) and Home Rule (not yet introduced). Well
then? Does it follow that Marx and Engels were “utopians”, that they put
forward “impracticable” national demands, or that they allowed themselves
to be influenced by the Irish petty-bourgeois nationalists (for there is no
doubt about the petty-bourgeois nature of the Fenian movement), etc.?  

No.  In the Irish question, too, Marx and Engels pursued a consistently
proletarian policy, which really educated the masses in a spirit of
democracy and socialism. Only such a policy could have saved both Ireland
and England half a

 

century of delay in introducing the necessary reforms, and prevented these
reforms from being mutilated by the Liberals to please the reactionaries.


The  policy of Marx and Engels on the Irish question serves as a
splendid example of the attitude the proletariat of the oppressor nations
should adopt towards national movements, an example which has lost none of
its immense practical importance. It serves as a warning against
that “servile haste” with which the philistines of all countries, colours
and languages hurry to label as “utopian” the idea of altering the
frontiers of states that were established by the violence and privileges of
the landlords and bourgeoisie of one nation.  

If  the Irish and English proletariat had not accepted Marx’s policy and
had not made the secession of Ireland their slogan, this would have been
the worst sort of opportunism, a neglect of their duties as democrats and
socialists, and a concession to English reaction and the
English bourgeoisie.  
 

Notes

Cf.  also Marx’s letter to Engels of June 3, 1867: “...I have learned
with real pleasure from the Paris letters to The Times about the
pro-Polish exclamations of the Parisians against Russia.... Mr. Proudhon
and his little doctrinaire clique are not the French people.”  —Lenin

[2]

By  the way, it is not difficult to see why, from a Social-Democratic
point of view, the right to “self-determination” means neither
federation nor autonomy (a though, speaking in the abstract, both
come under the category of “self-determination”). The right to federation
is simply meaningless, since federation implies a bilateral contract. It
goes without saying that Marxists cannot include the defence of federalism
in general in their programme. As far as autonomy is concerned, Marxists
defend, not the “right” to autonomy, but autonomy itself, as a general
universal principle of a democratic state with a mixed national
composition, and a great variety of geographical and other
conditions. Consequently, the recognition of the “right of nations to
autonomy” is as absurd as that of the “right of nations to federation”.

The  New York Daily Tribune—an American newspaper published
from 1841 to 1924. Until the middle fifties it was the organ of the Left
wing of the American Whigs, and thereafter the organ of the Republican
Party. Karl Marx contributed to the paper from August 1851 to March 1862,
and at his request Frederick Engels wrote numerous articles for it. During
the period of reaction that set in in Europe, Karl Marx and Frederick
Engels used this widely circulated and at that time progressive newspaper
to publish concrete material exposing the evils of capitalist
society. During the American Civil War Marx’s contributions to the
newspaper stopped. His break with The New York Daily Tribune was
largely due to the growing influence on the editorial board of the
advocates of compromise with the slam-owners, and the papers’s departure
from progressive positions. Eventually the newspaper swung still more to
the right.

## 1903 Programme




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 9. THE 1903 PROGRAMME AND ITS LIQUIDATORS








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



9. THE 1903 PROGRAMME AND ITS LIQUIDATORS

The  Minutes of the 1903 Congress, at which the Programme of the Russian
Marxists was adopted, have become a great rarity, and the vast majority of
the active members of the working-class movement today are unacquainted
with the motives underlying the various points (the more so since not all
the literature relating to it enjoys the blessings of legality...). It is
therefore necessary to analyse the debate that took place at the 1903
Congress on the question under discussion.  

Let  us state first of all that however meagre the Russian
Social-Democratic literature on the “right of nations to
self-determination” may be, it nevertheless shows clearly that this right
has always been understood to mean the right to secession. The Semkovskys,
Liebmans and Yurkeviches who doubt this and declare that §9 is
“vague”, etc., do so only because of their sheer ignorance or
carelessness. As far back as 1902, Plekhanov, in Zarya, defended
“the right to self-determination” in the draft programme, and wrote that
this demand, while not obligatory upon bourgeois democrats, was
“obligatory upon Social-Democrats”. “If we were to for got it or
hesitate, to advance it,” Plekhanov wrote, “for fear of

 

offending the national prejudices of our fellow-countrymen of Great-Russian
nationality, the call ... ‘workers of all countries, unite!’ would be a
shameful lie on our
lips....”[3] 

This  is a very apt description of the fundamental argument in favour of
the point under consideration; so apt that it is not surprising that the
“anythingarian” critics of our programme have been timidly avoiding
it. The abandonment of this point, no matter for what motives, is
actually a “shameful” concession to Great-Russian
nationalism. But why Great-Russian, when it is a question of the right of
all nations to self-determination? Because it refers to secession
from the Great Russians. The interests of the unity of the
proletarians, the interests of their class solidarity call for
recognition of the right of nations to secede—that is what
Plekhanov admitted twelve years ago in the words quoted above. Had our
opportunists given thought to this they would probably not have talked so
much nonsense about self-determination.  

At  the 1903 Congress, which adopted the draft programme that Plekhanov
advocated, the main work was done by the Programme
Commission. Unfortunately no Minutes of its proceedings were kept;
they would have been particularly interesting on this point, for it was
only in the Commission that the representatives of the Polish
Social-Democrats, Warszawski and Hanecki, tried to defend their views and
to dispute “recognition of the right to self-determination”. Any reader
who goes to the trouble of comparing their arguments (set forth in the
speech by Warszawski and the statement by him and Hanecki, pp. 134–36 and
388–90 of the Congress Minutes) with those which Rosa Luxemburg advanced
in her Polish article, which we have analysed, will find them identical.


How  were these arguments treated by the Programme Commission of the
Second Congress, where Plekhanov, more than anyone else, spoke against the
Polish Marxists? They were mercilessly ridiculed! The absurdity of
proposing to the Marxists of Russia that they should reject the
recognition of the right of nations to self-determination was demonstrated
so plainly and clearly that the Polish Marxists did not even venture to
repeat their arguments at the plenary meeting of the Congress! They
left the Congress, convinced of the

 

hopelessness of their case at the supreme assembly of
Marxists—Great-Russian, Jewish, Georgian, and Armenian.  

Needless  to say, this historic episode is of very great importance to
everyone seriously interested in his own programme. The fact that
the Polish Marxists’ arguments were completely defeated at the Programme
Commission of the Congress, and that the Polish Marxists gave up the
attempt to defend their views at the plenary meeting of the Congress is
very significant. No wonder Rosa Luxemburg maintained a “modest” silence
about it in her article in 1908—the recollection of the Congress must
have been too unpleasant!  She also kept quiet about the ridiculously inept
proposal made by Warszawski and Hanecki in 1903, on behalf of all Polish
Marxists, to “amend” §9 of the Programme, a proposal which neither
Rosa Luxemburg nor the other Polish Social-Democrats have ventured (or will
ever venture) to repeat.  

But  although Rosa Luxemburg, concealing her defeat in 1903, has
maintained silence over these facts, those who take an interest in the
history of their Party will make it their business to ascertain them and
give thought to their significance.  

On  leaving the 1903 Congress, Rosa Luxemburg’s friends submitted the
following statement: 


   “We  propose that Clause 7 [now Clause 9] of the draft
   programme read as follows: § 7. Institutions guaranteeing full
   freedom of cultural development to all nations incorporated in the
   state.” (P. 390 of the Minutes.)  


Thus,  the Polish Marxists at that time put forward views on the
national question that were so vague that instead of
self-determination they practically proposed the notorious
“cultural-national autonomy”, only under another name!  

This  sounds almost incredible, but unfortunately it is a fact. At the
Congress itself, attended though it was by five Bundists with five votes
and three Caucasians with six votes, without counting Kostrov’s
cousultative voice, not a single vote was cast for the
rejection of the clause about self-determination. Three votes were
cast for the proposal to add “cultural-national autonomy” to this clause
(in favour of Goldblatt’s formula: “the establishment of institutions
guaranteeing the nations full freedom of cultural development”)

 

and four votes for Lieber’s formula (“the right of nations to freedom in
their cultural development”).  

Now  that a Russian liberal party—the Constitutional-Democratic
Party—has appeared on the scene, we know that in its programme
the political self-determination of nations has been replaced by “cultural
self-determination”. Rosa Luxemburg’s Polish friends, therefore, were
“combating” the nationalism of the P.S.P., and, did it so
successfully that they proposed the substitution of a liberal
programme for the Marxist programme! And in the same breath they accused
our programme of being opportunist; no wonder this accusation was received
with laughter by the Programme Commission of the Second Congress!  

How  was “self-determination” understood by the delegates to the
Second Congress, of whom, as we have seen, not one was opposed to
“self-determination of nations”?  

The  following three extracts from the Minutes provide the answer: 

“Martynov  is of the opinion that the term
‘self-determination’ should not be given a broad interpretation; it merely
means the right of a nation to establish itself as a separate polity, not
regional self-government” (p. 171). Martynov was a member of the Programme
Commission, in which the arguments of Rosa Luxemburg’s friends were
repudiated and ridiculed. Martynov was then an Economist in his views, and
a violent opponent of Iskra; had he expressed an opinion that was
not shared by the majority of the Programme Commission he would certainly
have been repudiated.  

Bundist  Goldblatt was the first to speak when the Congress, after the
Commission had finished its work, discussed §8 (the present Clause 9)
of the Programme.  

He  said: 


   “No  objections can he raised to the ‘right to
   self-determination’. When a nation is fighting for independence, that
   should not he opposed. If Poland refuses to enter into lawful marriage with
   Russia, she should not be interfered with, as Plekhanov put it. I agree
   with this opinion within these limits” (pp. 175–76).  


Plekhanov  had not spoken on this subject at all at the plenary meeting
of the Congress. Goldblatt was referring to what Plekhanov had said at the
Programme Commission, where the “right to self-determination” had been
explained

 

in a simple yet detailed manner to mean the right to secession. Lieber, who
spoke after Goldblatt, remarked: 


   “Of  course, if any nationality finds that it cannot live
   within the frontiers of Russia, the Party will not place any
   obstacles in its way” (p. 176).  


The  reader will see that at the Second Congress of the Party, which
adopted the programme, it was unanimously understood that
self-determination meant “only” the right to secession. Even the Bundists
grasped this truth at the time, and it is only in our own deplorable times
of continued counter-revolution and all sorts of “apostasy” that we can
find people who, bold in their ignorance, declare that the programme is
“vague”. But before devoting time to these sorry would-be
Social-Democrats, let us first finish with the attitude of the Poles to the
programme.  

They  came to the Second Congress (1903) declaring that unity was
necessary and imperative. But they left the Congress after their
“reverses” in the Programme Commission, and their last word was
a written statement, printed in the Minutes of the Congress, containing the
above-mentioned proposal to substitute cultural-national autonomy
for self-determination.  

In  1906 the Polish Marxists joined the Party; neither upon
joining nor afterwards (at the Congress of 1907, the conferences
of 1907 and 1908, or the plenum of 1910) did they introduce a
single proposal to amend §9 of the Russian Programme!  

That  is a fact.  

And,  despite all utterances and assurances, this fact definitely proves
that Rosa Luxemburg’s friends regarded the question as having been settled
by the debate at the Programme Commission of the Second Congress, as well
as by the decision of that Congress, and that they tacitly acknowledged
their mistake and corrected it by joining the Party in 1906, after they had
left the Congress in 1903, without a single attempt to raise the question
of amending §9 of the Programme through Party channels.  

Rosa  Luxemburg’s article appeared over her signature in 1908—of
course, it never entered anyone’s head to deny Party publicists the right
to criticise the programme—and, since
 

the Writing of this article, not a single official body of the
Polish Marxists has raised the question of revising §9.  

Trotsky  was therefore: rendering a great disservice to certain admirers
of Rosa Luxemburg when he wrote, on behalf of the editors of
Borba, in issue No. 2 of that publication (March 1914): 


   “The  Polish Marxists consider that ‘the right to
   national self-determination’ is entirely devoid of political content and
   should be deleted from the programme” (p. 25).  


The  obliging Trotsky is more dangerous than an enemy! Trotsky could
produce no proof, except “private conversations” (i. e., simply
gossip, on which Trotsky always subsists), for classifying “Polish
Marxists” in general as supporters of every article by Rosa
Luxemburg. Trotsky presented the “Polish Marxists” as people devoid of
honour and conscience, incapable of respecting even their own convictions
and the programme of their Party. How obliging Trotsky is!  

When,  in 1903, the representatives of the Polish Marxists walked out of
the Second Congress over the right to self-determination, Trotsky
could have said at the time that they regarded this right as
devoid of content and subject to deletion from the programme.  

But  after that the Polish Marxists joined the Party whose
programme this was, and they have never introduced a motion to amend
 it.[1]


Why  did Trotsky withhold these facts from the readers of his journal?
Only because it pays him to speculate on fomenting differences between the
Polish and the Russian opponents of liquidationism and to deceive the
Russian workers on the question of the programme.  

Trotsky  has never yet held a firm opinion on any important question of
Marxism. He always contrives to worm his

 

way into the cracks of any given difference of opinion, and desert one
side for the other. At the present moment he is in the company of the
Bundists and the liquidators. And these gentlemen do not stand on ceremony
where the Party is concerned.  

Listen  to the Bundist Liebman.  


   “When,  fifteen years ago,” this gentleman writes, “the
   Russian Social-Democrats included the point about the right of every
   nationality to ‘self-determination’ in their programme, everyone [!] asked
   himself: What does this fashionable [!] term really mean? No answer was
   forthcoming [!]. This word was left [!] wrapped in mist. And indeed, at the
   time, it was difficult to dispel that mist. The moment had not come when
   this point could be made concrete—it was said—so let it remain wrapped
   in mist [!] for the time being and practice will show what content should
   he put into it.”  


Isn’t  it magnificent, the way this
“ragamuffin”[4] mocks at the Party programme?  

And  why does he mock at it?  

Because  he is an absolute ignoramus, who has never learnt anything or
even read any Party history, but merely happened to land in liquidationist
circles where going about in the nude is considered the “right” thing to
do as far as knowledge of the Party and everything it stands for is
concerned.  

Pomyalovsky’s  seminary student boasts of having “spat into a barrel of
sauerkraut”.[5] The Bundist gentlemen have gone one better. They let
the Liebmans loose to spit publicly into their own barrel. What do the
Liebmans care about the fact that the International Congress has passed a
decision, that at the Congress of their own Party the representatives of
their own Bund proved that they were quite able (and what “severe”
critics and determined enemies of Iskra they were!) to understand
the meaning of “self-determination” and were even in agreement with it?
And will it not be easier to liquidate the Party if the “Party
publicists” (no jokes, please!) treat its history and programme after the
fashion of the seminary student?  

Here  is a second “ragamuffin”, Mr. Yurkevich of
Dzvin. Mr. Yurkevich must have had the Minutes of the Second
Congress before him, because he quotes Plekhanov, as repeated by Goldblatt,
and shows that he is aware of the fact that self-determination can only
mean the right to secession. This, however, does not prevent him from
spreading slander

 

about the Russian Marxists among the Ukrainian petty bourgeoisie, alleging
that they stand for the “state integrity” of Russia. (No. 7–8, 1913,
p. 83, etc.) Of course, the Yurkeviches could not have invented a better
method than such slander to alienate the Ukrainian democrats from the
Great-Russian democrats. And such alienation is in line with the entire
policy of the group of Dzvin publicists who advocate the
separation of the Ukrainian workers in a special national
    organisation![2]


It  is quite appropriate, of course, that a group of nationalist
philistines, who are engaged in splitting the ranks of the
proletariat—and objectively this is the role of Dzvin— should
disseminate such hopeless confusion on the national question. Needless to
say, the Yurkeviches and Liebmans, who are “terribly” offended when they
are called “near Party men”, do not say a word, not a single word, as to
how they would like the problem of the right to secede to be
settled in the programme.  

But  here is the third and principal “ragamuffin”, Mr. Semkovsky, who,
addressing a Great-Russian audience through the columns of a liquidationist
newspaper, lashes at §9 of the Programme and at the same time declares
that “for certain reasons he does not approve of the proposal” to delete
this clause!  

This  is incredible, but it is a fact.  

In  August 1912, the liquidators’ conference raised the national
question officially. For eighteen months not a single article has appeared
on the question of §9, except the one written by Mr. Semkovsky. And in
this article the author repudiates the programme, “without
approving”, however, “for certain reasons” (is this a secrecy
disease?) the proposal to amend it! We may be sure that it would be
difficult to find anywhere in the world similar examples of opportunism, or
even worse—renunciation of the Party, and a desire to liquidate it.  

A  single example will suffice to show what Semkovsky’s arguments are
like: 



   “What  are we to do,” he writes, “if the Polish
   proletariat wants to fight side by side with the proletariat of all Russia
   within the framework of a single state, while the reactionary classes of
   Polish society, on the contrary, want to separate Poland from Russia and
   obtain a majority of votes in favour of secession by referendum? Should we,
   Russian Social-Democrats in the central parliament, vote together with our
   Polish comrades against secession, or—in order not to violate
   the ‘right to self-determination’—vote for secession?”
   (Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 71.)  


From  this it is evident that Mr. Semkovsky does not even understand the
point at issue! It did not occur to him that the right to
secession presupposes the settlement of the question by a parliament (Diet,
referendum, etc.) of the seceding region, not by a
central parliament.  

The  childish perplexity over the question “What are we to do”, if
under democracy the majority are for reaction, serves to screen the real
and live issue when both the Purishkeviches and the Kokoshkins
consider the very idea of secession criminal! Perhaps the proletarians of
all Russia ought not to fight the Purishkeviches and the
Kokoshkins today, but should by-pass them and fight the reactionary classes
of Poland!  

Such  is the sheer rubbish published in the liquidators’ organ of which
Mr. L. Martov is one of the ideological leaders, the selfsame L. Martov who
drafted the programme and spoke in favour of its adoption in 1903, and even
subsequently wrote in favour of the right to secede. Apparently L. Martov
is now arguing according to the rule: 


No  clever man is needed there;

   Better send Read,

   And I shall wait and
   see.[6] 


He sends Read-Semkovsky along and allows our programme to be distorted,
and endlessly muddled up in a daily paper whose new readers are
unacquainted with it!  

Yes.  Liquidationism has gone a long way—there are even very many
prominent ex-Social-Democrats who have not a trace of Party spirit left in
them.  

Rosa  Luxemburg cannot, of course, be classed with the Liebmans,
Yurkeviches and Semkovskys, but the fact that it was this kind of people
who seized upon her error shows with particular clarity the opportunism she
has lapsed into.

We  are informed that the Polish Marxists attended the Summer Conference
of the Russian Marxists in 1913 with only a consultative voice and
did not vote at all on the right to self-determination (secession),
declaring their opposition to this right in general. Of course, they had a
perfect right to act the way they did, and, as hitherto, to agitate in
Poland against secession. But this is not quite what Trotsky said; for the
Polish Marxists did not demand the “deletion” of §9 “from the
programme”.  —Lenin

Lenin  is quoting from G. V. Plekhanov’s article “The Draft Programme
of the Russian Social-Democratic Party” published in Zarya No. 4,
1902.  

Zarya —a Marxist scientific and political journal published
legally in Stuttgart in 1901–02 by the Editorial Board of
Iskra. Altogether four numbers (three issues) of Zarya
appeared: No. 1 in April 1901 (actually on March 23, new style); No. 2–3
in December 1901, and No. 4 in August 1902. The aims of the publication
were set forth in the “Draft of a Declaration of the Editorial Board of
Iskra and Zarya” written by Lenin in Russia. (See
present edition, Vol. 4.) In 1902, during the disagreement and conflicts
that arose on the Editorial Board of Iskra and Zarya,
Plekhanov proposed a plan for separating the newspaper from the journal
(with Zarya remaining under his editorship), but this proposal was
not accepted, and the two publications continued under a single editorial
board.  


Zarya  criticised international and Russian revisionism, and
defended the theoretical principles of Marxism. The following articles by
Lenin were published in this journal: =

“Casual Notes”, “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of
Liberalism”, “The ‘Critics’ on the Agrarian Question” (the first four
chapters of “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’\thinspace”),

## Conclusion




Lenin: 1914/self-det: 10. CONCLUSION








Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination



10. CONCLUSION

To sum up.  

As far as the theory of Marxism in general is concerned, the question
of the right to self-determination presents no difficulty. No one can
seriously question the London resolution of 1896, or the fact that
self-determination implies only the right to secede, or that the formation
of independent national states is the tendency in all bourgeois-democratic
revolutions.  

A difficulty is to some extent created by the fact that in Russia the
proletariat of both the oppressed and oppressor nations are fighting, and
must fight, side by side. The task is to preserve the unity of the
proletariat’s class struggle for socialism, and to resist all bourgeois and
Black-Hundred nationalist influences. Where the oppressed nations are
concerned, the separate organisation of the proletariat as an independent
party sometimes leads to such a bitter struggle against local nationalism
that the perspective becomes distorted and the nationalism of the oppressor
nation is lost sight of.  

But this distortion of perspective cannot last long. The experience of
the joint struggle waged by the proletarians of various nations has
demonstrated all too clearly that we must formulate political issues from
the all-Russia, not the “Cracow” point of view. And in all-Russia
politics it is the Purishkeviches and the Kokoshkins who are in the
saddle. Their ideas predominate, and their persecution of non-Russians for
“separatism”, for thinking about secession, is being preached,
and practised in the Duma, in the schools, in the churches, in the
barracks, and in hundreds and thousands of newspapers. It is this
Great-Russian nationalist poison that is polluting the entire all-Russia
political atmosphere. This is the misfortune of one nation, which, by
subjugating other nations, is strengthening reaction throughout Russia. The
memories of 1849 and 1863 form a living political tradition, which, unless
great storms arise, threatens to hamper every democratic and
especially every Social-Democratic movement for decades to come.


There can be no doubt that however natural the point of view of certain
Marxists belonging to the oppressed nations (whose “misfortune” is
sometimes that the masses of the

 

population are blinded by the idea of their “own” national liberation)
may appear at times, in reality the objective alignment of class
forces in Russia snakes refusal to advocate the right to self-determination
tantamount to the worst opportunism, to the infection of the proletariat
with the ideas of the Kokoshkins. And these ideas are, essentially, the
ideas and the policy of the Purishkeviches.  

Therefore, although Rosa Luxemburg’s point of view could at first have
been excused as being specifically Polish, “Cracow”
  narrow-mindedness,[1]

it is inexcusable today, when nationalism and, above all, governmental
Great-Russian nationalism, has everywhere gained ground, and when policy is
being shaped by this Great-Russian nationalism. In actual fact; it
is being seized upon by the opportunists of all nations, who fight
shy of the idea of “storms” and “leaps”, believe that the
bourgeois-democratic revolution is over, and follow in the wake of the
liberalism of the Kokoshkins.  

Like any other nationalism, Great-Russian nationalism passes through
various phases, according to the classes that are dominant in the bourgeois
country at any given time. Up to 1905, we almost exclusively knew
national-reactionaries. After the revolution, national-liberals
arose in our country.  

In our country this is virtually the stand adopted both by the
Octobrists and by the Cadets (Kokoshkin), i.e., by the whole of the
present-day bourgeoisie.  

Great-Russian national-democrats will inevitably appear later
on. Mr. Peshekhonov, one of the founders of the “Popular Socialist”
Party, already expressed this point of view (in the issue of Russkoye
Bogatstvo for August 1906) when he called for caution in regard to the
peasants’ nationalist prejudices. However much others may slander us
Bolsheviks and accuse us of “idealising” the peasant, we always

 

have made and always will make a clear distinction between peasant
intelligence and peasant prejudice, between peasant strivings for democracy
and opposition to Purishkevich, and the peasant desire to make peace with
the priest and the landlord.  

Even now, and probably for a fairly long time to come, proletarian
democracy must reckon with the nationalism of the Great-Russian peasants
(not with the object of making concessions to it, but in order to combat
 it).[2]

The awakening of nationalism among the oppressed nations, which be came so
pronounced after 1905 (let us recall, say, the group of
“Federalist-Autonomists” in the First Duma, the growth of the Ukrainian
movement, of the Moslem movement, etc.), will inevitably lead to greater
nationalism among the Great-Russian petty bourgeoisie in town and
countryside.  The slower the democratisation of Russia, the more
persistent, brutal and bitter will be the national persecution and
bickering among the bourgeoisie of the various nations. The particularly
reactionary nature of the Russian Purishkeviches will simultaneously give
rise to (and strengthen) “separatist” tendencies among the various
oppressed nationalities, which sometimes enjoy far greater freedom in
neighbouring states.  

In this situation, the proletariat, of Russia is faced with a twofold
or, rather, a two-sided task: to combat nationalism of every kind, above
all, Great-Russian nationalism; to recognise, not only fully equal rights,
for all nations in

 

general, but also equality of rights as regards polity, i.e., the right of
nations to self-determination, to secession. And at the same time, it is
their task, in the interests of a successful struggle against all and every
kind, of nationalism among all nations, to preserve the unity of the
proletarian struggle and the proletarian organisations, amalgamating these
organisations into a close-knit international association, despite
bourgeois strivings for national exclusiveness.  

Complete equality of rights for all nations; the right of nations to
self-determination; the unity of the workers of all nations—such is the
national programme that Marxism, the experience of the whole world, and the
experience of Russia, teach the workers.  


This article had been set up when I received No. 3 of Nasha
Rabochaya Gazeta, in which Mr. Vl. Kosovsky writes the following about
the recognition of the right of all nations to self-determination: 


   “Taken mechanically from the resolution of the First
   Congress of the Party (1898), which in turn had borrowed it from the
   decisions of international socialist congresses, it was given, as is
   evident from the debate, the same meaning at the 1903 Congress as was
   ascribed to it by the Socialist International, i.e., political
   self-determination, the self-determination of nations in the field of
   political independence. Thus the formula: national self-determination,
   which implies the right to territorial separation, does not in any way
   affect the question of how national relations within a given state
   organism should be regulated for nationalities that cannot or have no
   desire to leave the existing state.”  


It is evident from this that Mr. Vl. Kosovsky has teen the Minutes of
the Second Congress of 1903 and understands perfectly well the real (and
only) meaning of the term self-determination. Compare this with the fact
that the editors of the Bund newspaper Zeit let Mr. Liebman loose
to scoff at the programme and to declare that it is vague! Queer “party”
ethics among these Bundists.... The Lord alone knows why Kosovsky should
declare that the Congress took over the principle of self-determination
mechanically. Some people want to “object”, but how, why, and
for what reason—they do not know.  

 
Notes
 

[1]

It is not difficult to understand that the recognition by the Marxists
of the whole of Russia, and first and foremost by the Great
Russians, of the right of nations to secede in no way precludes
agitation against secession by Marxists of a particular
oppressed nation, just as the recognition of the right to divorce
does not preclude agitation against divorce in a particular case. We think,
therefore, that there will, be an inevitable increase in the number of
Polish Marxists who laugh at the non-existent “contradiction” now being
“encouraged” by Semkovsky and Trotsky.  —Lenin

[2]

It would be interesting to trace the changes that take place in Polish
nationalism, for example, in the process of its transformation from gentry
nationalism into bourgeois nationalism, and then into peasant
nationalism. In his book Das polnische Gemeinwesen im preussischen
Staat (The Polish Community in the Prussian State; there is a
Russian translation), Ludwig Bernhard, who shares the view of a German
Kokoshkin, describes a very typical phenomenon: the formation of a sort of
“peasant republic” by the Poles in Germany in the form of a close
alliance of the various co-operatives and other associations of
Polish peasants in their struggle for nationality, religion, and
“Polish” land. German oppression has welded the Poles together and
segregated them, after first awakening the nationalism of the gentry, then
of the bourgeoisie, and finally of the peasant masses (especially after the
campaign the Germans launched in 1873 against the use of the Polish
language in schools). Things are moving in the same direction in Russia,
and not only with regard to Poland.  —Lenin

In all capitalist Countries throughout the world, the
bourgeoisie resorts to two methods in its struggle against the
working-class movement and the workers’ parties. One method is that of
violence, persecution, bans, and suppression. In its fundamentals, this is
a feudal, medieval method. Everywhere there are sections and groups of the
bourgeoisie—smaller in the advanced countries and larger in the backward
ones—which prefer these methods, and in certain, highly critical moments
in the workers’ struggle against wage-slavery, the entire
bourgeoisie is agreed on the employment of such methods. Historical
examples of such moments are provided by Chartism in England, and 1849 and
1871 in
France.[11] 

The other method the bourgeoisie employs against the movement is that
of dividing the—workers, disrupting their ranks, bribing individual
representatives or certain groups of the proletariat with the object of
winning them over to its side. These are not feudal but purely
bourgeois and modern methods, in keeping with the developed and civilised
customs of capitalism, with the democratic system.  

For the democratic system is a feature of bourgeois society, the most
pure and perfect bourgeois feature,, in which the utmost freedom, scope and
clarity of the, class struggle are combined with the utmost cunning, with
ruses and subterfuges aimed at spreading the “ideological” influence of
the bourgeoisie among the wage-slaves with the object of diverting them
from their struggle against wage-slavery.  

In keeping with Russia’s boundless backwardness, the feudal methods of
combating the working-class movement are appallingly predominant in that
country. After 1905,

    

however, considerable “progress” was to be noted in the employment of
liberal and democratic methods to fool and corrupt the workers. Among the
liberal “methods” we have, for example; the growth of nationalism, a
stronger tendency to refurbish and revive religion “for the people” (both
directly and indirectly in the form of developing idealistic, Kantian and
Machist philosophy), the “successes” of bourgeois theories of political
economy (combined with the labour theory of value, or substituted for it),
etc., etc.  

Among the democratic methods of fooling the workers and subjecting them
to bourgeois ideology are the liquidationist-Narodnik-Cadet varieties. It
is to these that we intend to draw our readers’ attention in the present
article on certain topical events that have occurred on the fringe
of the working-class movement.  
I. The LIQUIDATORS’ and the NARODNIKS’ ALLIANCE AGAINST the
WORKERS

It is said that history is fond of irony, of playing tricks with
people, and mystifying them. In history this constantly happens to
individuals, groups and trends that do not realise what they really stand
for, i.e., fail to understand which class they really
(and not in their imagination) gravitate towards. Whether this lack of
understanding is genuine or hypocritical is a question that might interest
the biographer of a particular individual, but to the student of politics
this question is of secondary importance, to say the least.  

The important thing is how history and politics expose groups
and trends and reveal the bourgeois nature concealed behind their
“pseudo-socialist” or “pseudo-Marxist” phraseology. In the epoch of
bourgeois-democratic revolutions, scores of groups and trends have
everywhere, all over the world, imagined themselves to be “socialists”
and have posed as such (see, for example, the schools listed by Marx and
Engels in Chapter III of the Communist
Manifesto[12]). History has speedily exposed them in a matter of
ten to twenty years, or even less.  

Russia is now passing through just such a phase.  

It is over ten years since the Economists, then their successors the
Mensheviks, and then the Mensheviks’ successors—the

    

liquidators, began to fall away from the working-class movement.  

The Mensheviks were especially vociferous in their assertions that the
Bolsheviks had drawn close to the Narodniks....  

And now we have before us a very definite alliance between the
liquidators and the Narodniks directed against the working class and
against the Bolsheviks, who have remained true to that class.  

The alliance between the petty-bourgeois
intelligentsia—liquidationist and Narodnik—against the workers has been
developing spontaneously. At first it was stimulated by “practice”. No
wonder people say that practice marches ahead of theory (especially in the
case of those who are guided by a false theory). When the St. Petersburg
workers removed the liquidators from office, expelled these representatives
of bourgeois influence from the executives of the trade unions and from
their responsible positions on the Insurance Boards, the liquidators
found themselves in alliance with the Narodniks.  


   “As soon as we came into the hail (where the election of
   the Insurance Board was taking place),” a sincere and naive Narodnik wrote
   in Stoikaya Mysl, issue No. 5, “the narrow and factional stand
   taken by the Pravdists at once became clear. But we did not lose
   hope. Together with the liquidators, we drew up a non-factional election
   list giving us one seat on the Board and two alternate seats.” (See
   Put Pravdy No. 38, March 16, 1914.)  


Poor liquidators, what a cruel trick history has played on them! How
relentlessly has their new “friend and ally” the Left Narodnik, exposed
them!  

The liquidators did not even manage to renounce their own very formal
statements and resolutions of 1903 and other years, describing the Left
Narodniks as bourgeois democrats!  

History has swept away phrases, dispelled illusions and exposed the
class nature of the groups. Both the Narodniks and the liquidators are
groups of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, whom the Marxist workers have
removed from the movement, and who are trying to sneak in again under false
pretences.  
 

They are using the catchword “factionalism” as a cloak, a
word that the notorious Akimov, the leader of the Economists, used as a
weapon against the Iskrists at the Second Party Congress in 1903. Akimov’s
catchword, that of an extreme opportunist, was the only weapon left to the
liquidators and Narodniks. That rag of a Sovremennik seemed to
have come into the world with the deliberate purpose of showing up to all
literate people how rotten, useless and rusty that weapon was.  

This Sovremennik is quite a startling event in our democratic
journalistic world. Side by side with the names of casual contributors
(need drives all sorts of people into strange journals in order to
earn a little money!), we find an obviously demonstrative
combination of names intended to represent a combination of trends.  

The liberal Bogucharsky; the Narodniks Sukhanov, Rakitnikov,
B. Voronov, V. Chernov, and others; the liquidators Dan, Martov; Trotsky
and Sher (Potresov’s name was announced in issue No. 66 of Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta next to that of Plekhanov, but for some reason
it ... vanished); the Machists Bazarov and Lunacharsky, and last,
G. V. Plekhanov, the principal hero of
  Yedinstvo[1]

(spelt both with a small and a capital letter)—such are the
ostentatious names that sparkle in the list of
Sovremennik’s contributors. And fully in keeping with this, the
highlight of the journal’s trend is the advocacy (by the
Narodniks) of an alliance between the Narodniks and the “Marxists” (no
joking!).  

The reader can judge what this advocacy is from the articles penned by
Mr. Sukhanov, the head of this journal. Here are some of the most
important of this gentleman’s “ideas”.  


   “The old cleavage, at all events, has disappeared. It is
   no longer possible to determine where Marxism ends and Narodism
   begins. Both Narodism and Marxism will be found on either side. And both
   sides are neither Marxist nor ‘Narodnik’. Indeed, could it, and can it, be
   otherwise? Can any twentieth-century collectivist think in any but the
   Marxist way? And can any socialist in Russia he anything but a Narodnik?”
   

   “The same thing should he said about the present-day
   Marxist agrarian programme as we said last time about the Narodnik agrarian

    

   programme: in its method of stating the case it is a Marxist programme, but
   in its practical aims it is a Narodnik programme. It appeals to the
   ‘historical course of things’ and it strives to embody the slogan: land and
   freedom”. (No. 7, pp. 75–76.)  


That will suffice, I think!  

This Mr. Sukhanov publicly boasts that Plekhanov agrees with him. But
Plekhanov is silent!  

But let us examine Mr. Sukhanov’s line of argument. This new ally of
Plekhanov and the liquidators has “liquidated” the difference between
Marxism and Narodism on the ground that, as he claims, the practical aims
of both trends embody the slogan: land and freedom.  

This, wholly and literally, is an argument in defence of
“unity” between the workers and the bourgeoisie. We might say,
for example, that “in their practical aims” both the working class and
the liberal bourgeoisie “strive to embody” the slogan of a
constitution. From this, the clever Mr. Sukhanov should draw the conclusion
that the cleavage into proletariat and bourgeoisie has been “liquidated”
and that it is “impossible to determine where” proletarian democracy
“ends” and bourgeois democracy begins.  

Take the text of the Marxist agrarian programme. Sukhanov behaves like
all liberal bourgeois who pick out a “practical” slogan
(“Constitution”!) and declare that the difference between the socialist
and the bourgeois world outlook is a matter of “abstract theory”! But we
take the liberty of believing that the meaning and significance of
practical slogans, the interests of which class these slogans serve, and
how they serve them, are matters to which class-conscious workers and all
those who take an intelligent interest in politics cannot remain
indifferent.  

We turn to the Marxist agrarian programme (which Mr. Sukhanov referred
to in order to distort it out of all recognition) and at once find, next to
practical points that are objects of controversy among Marxists (for
example, municipalisation), other points that are indisputable.


“With a view to eliminating survivals of the serf system, which are a
direct and heavy burden upon the peasants, and in order to facilitate the
free development of the class struggle in the rural districts” ... this is
how the Marxist agrarian programme begins. To Mr. Sukhanov this is

    

unimportant “abstract theory”! Whether we want a constitution to
facilitate the free development of the class struggle between the
proletariat and the bourgeoisie or to facilitate “social conciliation”
between the workers and the capitalists is a matter of no importance; that
is “abstract theory”. That is what all bourgeois would have us believe.


The bourgeois correctly expresses his class interests when he tries to
persuade the workers of this. Mr. Sukhanov behaves entirely like a
bourgeois when he relegates to the background the question as to
what we need agrarian reforms for—for the purpose of
facilitating the free development of the class struggle between the
wage-workers and their masters, big and small, or for the purpose of
facilitating “social conciliation” between them with the aid of bourgeois
catchwords like “labour” economy?  

A little further on we read in the Marxist agrarian programme that
Marxists ... “will always and invariably oppose every attempt to check the
economic progress”. As is known, that is the very reason why Marxists
declare that every at tempt, however slight, to restrict the freedom of
mobilisation (the buying, selling, mortgaging, etc.) of peasant land is a
reactionary measure harmful to the workers and to social
development as a whole.  

The Narodniks—from the “Social-Cadet” Peshekhonov to the Left
Narodniks of Smelaya Mysl—stand for restricting the freedom of
mobilisation in one way or another. The Narodniks are the worst kind of
reactionaries on this question, the Marxists say.  

Mr. Sukhanov evades this point! He is reluctant to recall that it was
this that made Plekhanov call the Narodniks “socialist-reactionaries”
Mr. Sukhanov brushes “abstract theory” aside on the plea that he stands
for “practice”, and he brushes aside “practice” (freedom to mobilise
peasant land) on the general plea that he stands for the slogan of “land
and freedom”.  

The conclusion to be drawn is clear: Mr. Sukhanov is nothing more nor
less than a bourgeois who is trying to obscure the class strife
between workers and masters.  

And it is these bourgeois that the Marxist agrarian programme refers to
when it says: 
 

“In all cases and in every situation connected with democratic
agrarian reform” (note: under all circumstances and in every situation,
i.e., municipalisation, division, or any other likely form)... Marxists
“make it their object to work steadily towards an independent class
organisation of the rural proletariat, to explain to it the
irreconcilable antagonism between its interests and those of the
peasant bourgeoisie, to warn it against being beguiled by the petty
farming system, which will never, as long as commodity
production exists, be able to abolish poverty among the masses,” etc.


That is what the Marxist agrarian programme says. That is exactly what
is said in that point of the programme which the Mensheviks accepted
from the Bolsheviks’ draft at the Stockholm Congress, i.e., the
point that is least disputed and most generally recognised among Marxists.


That is what it says in the most important point on the question of
Narodism, which deals with the “small farming system 

But Mr. Sukhanov passes this question over in complete
silence!  

Mr. Sukhanov has done away with the “old cleavage”, with the division
of trends into Marxism and Narodism, by ignoring the clear and
definite wording of the “Marxist agrarian programme” aimed
against Narodism!  

Without doubt, Mr. Sukhanov is a mere windbag—many of his kind haunt
the drawing-rooms of Our liberal “society”—who has no idea of Marxism,
and airily “does away” with this unimportant socialist division into
Marxism and Narodism.  

As a matter of fact, Marxism and Narodism are poles apart, both in
theory and in practice. Marx’s theory is that of the development of
capitalism and of the class struggle between the wage-workers and the
master class. The theory of Narodism is the theory of the bourgeois white
washing of capitalism with the aid of catchwords like “labour economy”;
it is a theory which plays down, obscures and hinders the class struggle by
means of these very same catchwords, by advocating restriction, of the
mobilisation of the land, and so forth.  
 

Historically, the depth of the gulf between Marxism and Narodism in
Russia was revealed by practice—not of slogans, of course, for
only brainless people can regard “slogans” as “practice”—but by the
practice of the open and mass struggle of millions in
1905–07. This practice showed that Marxism had merged with the
working-class movement and that Narodism had merged (or had begun to merge)
with the movement of the petty-bourgeois peasantry (the Peasant
Union,[13] the First and Second Duma elections, the peasant movement,
and so forth).  

Narodism stands for bourgeois democracy in Russia.  

This, was proved by the half a century of evolution of this trend and
by the open struggles of the millions in 1905–07. This was recognised
repeatedly in the most emphatic and official manner by the supreme bodies
of the “Marxist whole” from 1903 to 1907, and down to the Summer
Conference of 1913.  

The publicists’ alliance that we see today among the lenders
of Narodism (Chernov, Rakitnikov and Sukhanov) and various
Social-Democratic intellectualist factions that are either openly opposed
to the “underground”, i. e., the workers’ party (the
     liquidators[2]

Dan, Martov and Cherevanin) or else help these liquidationist
workerless groups (Trotsky and Sher, Bazarov, Lunacharsky and
Plekhanov), is in fact nothing more nor less than an alliance
of bourgeois intellectuals directed against the workers.  

We regard Pravdism as the expression of the workers’ unity on the basis
of genuine recognition of the “underground” and of definite decisions
that co-ordinate and guide tactics in the old spirit (the decisions of
January 1912 and of February and the summer of 1913). It is a fact that
between January 1, 1912 and May 13, 1914, Pravdism united 5,674 workers’
groups as against 1,421 united by the liquidators, and none, or almost
none, by the Vperyod, Plekhanov, Trotsky and Sher, and other
groups. (See Rabochy No. 1, “From the History of the Workers’
Press in Russia”, p. 19 and Trudovaya Pravda No,2, of May 30,
1914.[3]

)


 

It is a fact that this workers’ unity is built on the firm basis of
integral, complete and, in principle, consistent decisions on all
questions affecting the lives of the Marxist workers. Here you have a
whole, for four-fifths have an absolute right to represent, to act
and speak on behalf of the “whole”.  

But the Sovremennik alliance of the leaders of Narodism and
all sorts of Social-Democratic workerless groups (with out definite
tactics, without definite decisions, knowing only vacillations between the
trend and the united body of Pravdism on the one hand, and the liquidators
on the other)—this alliance sprang up spontaneously. Not
one of the “Social-Democratic workerless groups” dared to come out
in favour of such an alliance straightforwardly, clearly and
openly—because the Summer Conference of 1913 expressed opposition to an
alliance with the Narodniks! Not one of these groups, neither the
liquidators, the Vperyod people, nor Plekhanov and Co., and
Trotsky and Co., dared do this! All of them simply swam with the stream,
carried along by their opposition to Pravdism and a desire to break or
weaken it, and instinctively seeking assistance one from another
against the four-fifths of the workers—the liquidators from
Sukhanov and Chernov, Sukhanov and Chernov from Plekhanov, Plekhanov from
these two, Trotsky also from them, and so forth. None of these groups
displays anything like a uniform policy, tactics that can be called at all
definite, or a frank declaration to the workers in defence of its alliance
with the Narodniks.  

It is a most unprincipled alliance of bourgeois intellectuals against
the workers. Plekhanov is to be pitied for the disreputable company he
finds himself in, but let us face the truth squarely. People can call the
alliance of these groups “unity” if they wish to, but we call it a
breakaway from the working-class whole, and the facts
prove that our view is correct.  
2. HOW THE LIBERALS DEFEND “UNITY” BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND THE
LIQUIDATORS

The arrival in Russia of Emile Vandervelde, the Chairman of the
International Socialist Bureau, naturally gave a fillip to the discussion
of the question of unity. E. Vandervelde’s

    

immediate mission was to collect information on this question, explore the
ground and take all possible steps to promote unity. We know from press
reports that he visited the editorial offices of both newspapers, the
Marxist and liquidationist, and exchanged opinions with representatives of
both these newspapers at a “banquet”.  

Soon after Vandervelde returned to Brussels, an interview with the
Chairman of the International Socialist Bureau appeared in the two
principal French socialist dailies; the Paris
Humanité[14] and the Brussels Peuple in their
issues of Sunday, June 21, new style. In this interview the, differences
among the Russian Social-Democrats were inaccurately formulated by
Vandervelde. Some of them, he said, “want to organise legally and demand
the right of association, while others want to secure the immediate
proclamation ... of the
      ‘pillar’ [4]

and the expropriation of the land.” Vandervelde called this
difference “rather childish”.  

We shall scarcely be wrong in assuming that this comment of
Vandervelde’s will evoke a “rather good-natured” smile from
class-conscious workers in Russia who read it. If “some” “want to
organise legally”, that is, if they stand for an open, legal party, then
it is obvious that others challenge this point, not by referring
to the “pillar” or “pillars”, but by defending the “underground” and
categorically refusing to take part in the “struggle for a legal
party”. A difference of this kind is one that affects the Party’s very
existence and—our highly esteemed comrade E. Vandervelde will forgive our
saying so—there can be no “conciliation” here. It is impossible partly
to abolish the “underground” and partly to substitute a legal party for
it....  

But Vandervelde did not only question people about the differences. On
this matter both the Chairman and the Secretary of the International
Socialist Bureau have collected in their briefcases a mass of documents,
reports and letters from representatives of all and sundry, from real and
from fictitious “leading bodies”. Vandervelde evidently decided to take
advantage of his visit to St. Petersburg to collect certain
factual data on the degree to which the different socialist (and
“pseudo-socialist”) trends and groups in Russia

    

exercise mass influence. Vandervelde is a man with no little
political experience, and of course he knows perfectly well that in
politics in general and in the working-class movement in particular only
those trends which exercise mass influence can be taken seriously.  

On this question we find the following statement by Vandervelde in the
two French socialist newspapers mentioned above: “The socialists in Russia
have three daily newspapers. The revolutionaries [evidently this refers to
the Left Narodniks] publish newspapers with a circulation of 10,000 to
12,000; the Leninists have a circulation of 35,000 to 40,000 and the
moderates [moderés—evidently this refers to the
liquidators] about 16,000.”  

Here E. Vandervelde is slightly in error. As is well known, the
Left-Narodnik newspaper is not a daily; it comes out three times a
week. Moreover, according to our information, he has understated the
maximum circulation of the Pravdist newspaper; it has reached 48,000. It
would be desirable for exact information on this question (so important for
a study of the working-class movement) to be collected for a whole month
for example, if it is impossible to collect it for a year.  

But what a great difference there is between Vandervelde, the true
European, who attaches no importance to Asiatic gullibility or
rule-of-thumb methods but collects the facts, and the Russian,
liquidationist and liberal-bourgeois windbags, who pose as “Europeans”!
For example, in an article published in the newspaper Rech and
entitled “E. Vandervelde and the Russian Socialists” (No. 152, of June 7
[20], the day before the interview with Vandervelde appeared in Paris and
Brussels), the official representatives of the Cadets wrote the following:



   “When, at a dinner-party, one of the Bolsheviks assured
   Vandervelde that they had no one to unite with, as ‘in the workshops, among
   the working class, all were already united around the single Pravdist
   banner, except for a mere handful of intellectuals’, he, of course, was
   guilty of an exaggerated polemical overstatement.”  


This is a sample of a liquidationist and liberal lie clothed in glib
and polished phrases.  

“An exaggerated polemical overstatement!” As if there are
overstatements which are not exaggerations.... The

    

official Cadets not only write in an illiterate manner, but also
deliberately deceive their readers. If the Bolsheviks were guilty of “a
polemical overstatement” why don’t you, Cadet gentlemen—since you have
raised this question in the press—quote facts that are not an
overstatement and not polemical?  

During the three or four days he spent in Russia, E. Vandervelde, who
does not know Russian, managed to collect objective data. But the
St. Petersburg Cadets, just like the St. Petersburg
     liquidators,[5]

have never published any objective data in their
newspapers, and groundlessly and hypocritically accuse the Pravdists of
“overstatement”!  

Let us take Vandervelde’s data. According to these, the weekly
circulation of the Marxist, liquidationist and Narodnik newspapers
respectively is as follows: 





 
 
per  cent
per  cent
 




Marxist newspaper . . . . 
240,000
64.5
71.41}
100%


Liquidationist . . . . . .
96,000
25.8
28.6}


Narodnik . . . . . . . . .
36,000
9.7
   


   Total . . . . 
372,000
100.0
   




These are the objective data collected by the Chairman of the
International Socialist Bureau. Even if we include the Narodniks, with whom
only the liquidators, Machists and Plekhanov wish to “unite” but
are afraid to say so openly, the Pravdists still have a majority of nearly
two-thirds. Without counting the Narodniks, the Pravdists have a majority
of 71.4 per cent, i.e., more than seven-tenths, over the
liquidators!  

But the newspapers are read and maintained not only by workers. The
objective data on collections published in both the Marxist and
liquidationist newspapers have shown that (between January 1 and May 13,
1914) the Pravdists had 80 per cent of the workers’ groups, the
St. Petersburg percentage being as high as 86. Of the sum of 21,000 rubles
collected by the Pravdists, over eight-tenths was from workers, whereas
with the liquidators, more than half the
    

donations came from the
  bourgeoisie.[6]

Hence, it has been fully and definitely proved that the circulation figures
understate the predominance of the Pravdists, since the
liquidationist newspaper is maintained by the bourgeoisie. And the
no less objective returns of the Insurance Board elections show that during
the election of the All-Russia Insurance Board the Bolsheviks had 47
delegates out of 57, i. e., 82.4 per cent.  

In spreading among the masses, through the medium of their press, the
accusation that the Pravdists “overstate” (and even “exaggeratedly
overstate”), without quoting any objective data either on the circulation
of the newspapers, or on the workers’ groups, or on the Insurance Board
elections, the Cadets are deliberately lying, and elevating the
liquidators.  

The class interests of Russia’s liberal bourgeoisie compel it of course
to defend the liquidators, whom the Marxists unanimously regard (the
decision of 1910) as “vehicles of bourgeois influence on the
proletariat”. But when, at the same time, the liberals try to pose as
“impartial” people, their lie becomes particularly hypocritical and
disgusting.  

The Cadets’ utterances have one and only one political purpose, viz.,
to use the liquidators as vehicles of bourgeois influence on the workers.



   “There is no doubt,” Reels continues, “that
   genuine [!] working-class intellectuals, those workers who bore the brunt
   of Social-Democratic [! as appraised by the Cadets, who are experts in
   Social-Democracy] work in the most trying years, sympathise, not with the
   Bolsheviks, but with their opponents [the liquidators and Mensheviks]. To
   dissever these elements from the Russian workers’ party would so impoverish
   it intellectually that the Bolsheviks themselves would stand aghast at
   their own handiwork.”  


This is what the Cadets write in a Rech editorial article.


And here, for comparison, is what L. M., the liquidators’ ideological
leader, wrote in issue No. 3 of Nasha Zarya (1914, p. 68).  


   “This is a revolt [of the Pravdist workers] against the
   Dementievs, Gvozdevs, Chirkins, Romanovs, Bulkins, Kabtsans and the rest,
   as

    

   representatives of a whole—and, in the capitals, fairly large—section
   of the Marxist workers, who have been trying to ‘liquidate’ the childishly
   romantic stage of the Russian working-class movement.”  


As you see, the similarity is complete. In Rech editorial
articles the Cadets fully repeat in their own name the refrain that
L. M. sings in Nasha Zarya. The limited circulations of Nasha
Zarya and Nasha Likvidatorskaya Gazeta are
supplemented by the Cadet newspapers, which vouch for the
Social-Democracy of Bulkin, Chirkin and Co.  

Mr. L. M. gives the names of a handful of liquidationist workers. We
willingly repeat these names. All class-conscious workers in Russia will at
once recognise these liberal workers, who have long been known for
the struggle they have been waging against the “underground”, i. e.,
against the Party. Read what Bulkin wrote in this very same Nasha
Zarya alongside of L. M. and you will see that both repudiate the
“underground” and, to the delight of the liberals, abuse it.  

And so we shall place on record and take cognisance of the fact that
the “Dementievs, Gvozdevs, Chirkins, Romanovs, Bulkins and Kabtsans”,
whom Mr. L. M. mentions, are, as the Cadets assure us, “genuine
working-class intellectuals”. They are indeed genuine liberal workers!
This is fully borne out by Bulkin’s article. We strongly advise
class-conscious workers not yet familiar with the utterances of the
above-mentioned liberal proletarians to read it.  

The liberal Rech tries to scare us with the prospect of the
“disseverance from the workers’ party” of these (as Rech assures
us) Social-Democrats, of these Social-Democrats whom Rech
eulogises.  

But we shall reply merely with a smile, for it is common knowledge that
this handful of men have cut themselves off by going over to the
liberal-liquidators, and that this “disseverance” served as a guarantee
and foundation for the formation of a genuine workers’ (not
liberal-labour) party.  

In the same editorial article flee/i praises the “civic
courage of the calm and sometimes damping utterances” of the
liquidators and liberal workers. Trust Rech and the liberals to
praise them!  The liberals in Russia, particularly after 1905, can exert no
direct influence on the workers. They cannot help appreciating the
liquidators, who under the guise of

    

Social-Democracy carry on the same liberal “damping” work and act as
vehicles for this same “bourgeois influence on the proletariat” (see
decision of 1910!).  


   “The differences between them [the Social-Democratic
   groups] will not be soon removed,” Rech writes, “but while
   preserving their specific features they must unite, not carry their strife
   into the ranks of the workers, who are only just awakening to conscious
   political life. The split among the workers is a matter of great rejoicing
   to the reactionaries. This alone is enough to make honest people in both
   groups strive sincerely and seriously for unity.”  


This is what Rech writes.  

We are very glad not to belong to the liberal company of
“honest” people and to those they regard as “honest”. We would consider
it a dishonour to belong to such people. We are convinced that
only utterly na\"ive or foolish people can believe in the “impartiality”
of the liberal bourgeois, especially where the working-class movement for
emancipation, i. e., its movement against the bourgeoisie, is concerned.


The Cadets are mistaken in thinking that the Russian workers are
childishly naive, or that they are capable of believing the liberal
bourgeoisie’s “impartial” appraisal of “honesty”. The liberal bourgeois
regards the liquidators and their advocates as “honest” men because,
and only because, liquidationism renders a political service to the
bourgeoisie as a vehicle of bourgeois influence on the proletariat.  

Accepting full responsibility for their acts, the united Marxists of
Russia declared straightforwardly, openly and before all the workers of
Russia, that a definite group of liquidators, the Nasha Zarya and
Luck group, etc., stood beyond the pale of the
Party. This declaration was made in January 1912. Since then, in the
course of two-and-a-half years, 5,674 workers’ groups, as against 1,421
groups for the liquidators and all their supporters, i.e., four-fifths of
the class-conscious workers of Russia, have aligned them selves with
Pravdism, i. e., approved of the January decision. The liquidators
acted in such a way that the workers moved away from them. Our
decision has been confirmed by events and by the experience of the vast
majority of the workers.  

It is in their own selfish class interests that the liberals
advocate “unity” (between the workers and the liquidators).

    

Only the liquidators’ breakaway from the workers’ party enabled the latter
to weather the hard times with honour—we attach to this word a
different meaning from what you Rech gentlemen do! The separation
of the liquidators from the workers’ party gave the reactionaries cause,
not for “rejoicing” but for sorrow, since the liquidators stood
in the way of recognition of the old forms, the old “hierarchy”, the old
decisions, etc., and they themselves, for two-and-a-half years, proved
absolutely incapable of forming any kind of organisation whatsoever. The
“August” (1912) bloc of the liquidators and their friends collapsed.


It was, only despite the liquidators, only without
them and against them, that the workers were able to conduct that
brilliant campaign of strikes, insurance elections and the establishment of
newspapers which everywhere resulted in a four-fifths majority for the
opponents of liquidationism.  

By a “split” the liberals understand the removal from the workers’
ranks of the opponents of the “underground”, a handful of liquidationist
intellectuals. By “unity” they under stand the maintenance of
liquidationist influence over the workers.  

We regard the matter differently. By “unity” we mean the fact of
four-fifths of the workers having rallied around the old banner. By a split
we mean the refusal of the liquidationist group to accept and bow to the
will of the majority of the workers, thus flouting that will. Convinced by
experience that during two-and-a-half years Pravdism has rallied
four-fifths of the workers, we consider it necessary to advance towards
still greater unity along the same path—from four-fifths to
nine-tenths, and then to ten-tenths of the workers.  

The difference in the positions and points of view of the proletariat
and of the bourgeoisie gives rise to two opposite views regarding the
liquidators—our view and that of the liberals.  

How is Plekhanov’s position to be explained? In 1908 he broke with the
liquidators so emphatically, and at one time upheld, in the press, the
Party’s decisions in opposition to the liquidators with such firmness, that
some people hoped that his vacillations had come to an end. Now, when
four-fifths of the workers have rallied around Pravdism, Plekhanov

    

is beginning to vacillate again. The only possible explanation of his
“position”, which, in effect, now fully coincides with that of
the liberal Rech, is that it is due to his personal
vacillations—a disease he contracted in 1903.  

Like Rech, Plekhanov interprets “unity” to mean ensuring the
liquidators’ influence over the workers in defiance of the will of the
workers, in defiance of the Party’s decisions, in spite of the liquidators’
flouting of these decisions. Yesterday Plekhanov compared Mr. Potresov with
Judas, and, quite rightly stated that the apostles were stronger
without Judas than with him. Today, however, when the
facts have definitely proved that the liquidators are entirely at
one with Potresov and that they flout the Party’s decisions, Plekhanov
turns towards the liquidators and advises the Pravdists not to talk to them
in the “language of conquerors”! in other words, to put it more bluntly,
the majority of the workers should refrain from demanding that
their will be recognised and their decisions respected by the minority,
which follows the lead of those who are deliberately violating the Party’s
decisions!  

The class-conscious workers will have to sadly admit that Plekhanov is
suffering from another attack of the political disease of wavering and
vacillation which he contracted ten years ago... and will ignore him.  


There is, however, another explanation of Plekhanov’s vacillations, an
explanation to which we give second place because it does Plekhanov even
less credit. Groups of vacillating intellectuals inevitably spring up
between the con tending trends—the liquidationist (which draws
its social strength from the sympathy of the liberal bourgeoisie) and the
Pravdist (which draws its strength from the class-consciousness and
solidarity of the majority of the workers in Russia, who are awakening from
their darkness and are seeing the light). These groups have no social force
behind them, and can have no mass influence on the workers, because
politically they are mere cyphers. Instead of a firm, clear line which
attracts the workers and is confirmed by living experience, narrow
circle diplomacy reigns in such groups. The absence of contact with
the masses, the absence of historical roots in

    

the mass trends of Social-Democracy in Russia (Social-Democracy became a
mass movement in Russia with the strikes of 1895), and the absence of a
consistent, integral, clear and absolutely definite line tested by many
years of experience, i. e., lack of answers to the questions of tactics,
organisation and programme—such is the soil on which narrow circle
diplomacy thrives, and such are its symptoms.  

Plekhanov’s newspaper Yedinstvo, as a political body, reveals
all these symptoms (like Trotsky’s Borba. Incidentally, let the
reader ponder over the reasons for the disunity between these
alleged “uniters”, Borba and Yedinstvo...). Deputy
Buryanov, like every deputy who is comparatively “long-lived” among the
very short-lived politicians in Russia, was for a long time a liquidator,
but has now “vacillated” towards Plekhanov. Whither he has vacillated and
for how long, he does not himself know. But for narrow circle diplomacy
there is, of course, no greater stroke of luck than the acquisition of such
a “vacillating” deputy, who aspires to “unity” between the Six who want
to help the liquidators of the Party flout the will of the
majority of the workers, and the Six who want to give effect to that will.


Imagine “unity” between the two Sixes independently of the
will of the majority of the workers. You will say that it is unimaginable
and monstrous, because deputies should perform the will of the majority!
But what the proletariat regards as monstrous the liberals regard
as a virtue, a boon, a blessing, honesty, and probably, even something
sacred. (Struve, in Russkaya Mysl, will certainly argue tomorrow,
and he will be supported in this by Berdayev, Izgoyev, Merezhkovsky and
Co., that the Leninists are sinful “splitters”, while the liquidators and
Plekhanov, who is today defending them from the “conqueror” workers, are
holy instruments of the will of God.)  

Accept for a moment this (in effect liberal) point of view of “unity”
between the two Duma Sixes independently of the will of the
majority of the workers. You will at once realise that it is in the narrow
circle interests of Buryanov and the group of publicists who write for
Yedinstvo to play upon the differences between the two
Sixes, and use their differences in order to act the perpetual role of the
“conciliator”!  
 

Such a conciliator, be it Buryanov, Trotsky, Plekhanov, Slier, Chernov,
Sukhanov, or anybody else, may say: On the one hand, the liquidationist Six
are wrong, for they are liquidating the Party’s decisions. On the other
hand, the Pravdist Six are wrong, because they talk to their colleagues in
the unbecoming, improper, and sinful “language of conquerors”, claiming
to do so on behalf of an alleged majority. Such a “conciliator” may even
go to the length of calling this eclectic and intriguer’s conduct
“dialectical” and lay claim to the title of “uniter”.... After all,
there have been cases like this in our Party. Recall, for example, the part
played by the Bundists and Tyszka at the Stockholm and London congresses,
and in the period of 1906–11 in general.  

Those were happy days for the narrow circle diplomats and sad ones for
the workers’ party, days when the class-conscious workers had not yet
rallied closely enough against those vehicles of bourgeois influence, the
Economists and Mensheviks.  

Those days are now passing. Rech, the Cadet organ, be
wails the “carrying of strife into the ranks of the workers”. This
is the point of view of the liberal gentleman. We welcome the
“carrying of strife into the ranks of the workers”, for they and they
alone will distinguish between “strife” and differences on
principles; they will sort out these differences for themselves,
form their own opinion and decide not “with whom to go, but where
to
go”,[7]

i. e., their own definite and clear line, drawn up and tested by
themselves.  

That day is approaching and it has come. The mass of Pravdist workers
can already distinguish between “strife” and differences; they
have already sorted out these disagreements for themselves and have already
determined their own line. The figures concerning the workers’ groups
after two years of open struggle (1912 and 1913) have proved this
in fact.  

Narrow circle diplomacy is coming to an
end.[8]
   


    

3. WHY THE WORKERS’ ORGANISATIONS PUBLICLY DENOUNCED THE LIQUIDATORS AS
SLANDERERS?

Put Pravdy, issue No. 92 for May 21, 1914, published the
resolution adopted by representatives of ten industrial organisations
in the city of Moscow. This resolution very emphatically and sharply
condemned Malinovsky’s disruptive resignation as a “crime”, then
expressed complete confidence in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group
in the Duma (“march firmly along your road—the working class is with
you!”), and lastly, publicly denounced the liquidators of Nasha
Rabochaya Gazeta as people who “throw scurrilous abuse at the
retiring deputy”; these people’s conduct is compared with “the
spreading of slanderous rumours by the Right press with the object of
creating confusion in the ranks of the workers”.  

“It is the sacred duty of all those to whom the cause of labour is
dear,” the representatives of the ten industrial organisations of Moscow
stated in their resolution, “to rally their forces and offer united
resistance to the slanderers.” “In reply, the working class will rally
more closely around its representatives [i. e., the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group] and contemptuously ignore the
slanderers.”  

There is no need for us to quote any more of the numerous workers’
resolutions couched in similar terms, or the opinion of the Lettish
workers’
      newspaper,[9]

etc. That would be need less repetition.  

Let us see what happened.  

Why did the class-conscious workers of Russia, through the
representatives of ten industrial organisations in Moscow, and many others,
publicly denounce the liquidators of

    

Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta as filthy slanderers, and call upon the
working class contemptuously to ignore them?  

What did Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta do?  

It spread insidious rumours and insinuations to the effect that
Malinovsky is an agent provocateur.  

It did not name a single accuser. It did not quote a single definite
fact. It did not submit a scrap of definitely formulated evidence, backed
by references to at least Party pseudonyms, to objects of police raids,
dates, or anything of the kind.  

All we had was insidious rumours, an attempt to create a sensation out
of Malinovsky’s “inexplicable” resignation from the Duma. But it was
precisely for this inexplicable resignation, for this secret flight that
the organised workers, the members of the workers’ party, severely censured
Malinovsky.  

The organised Marxist workers at once called together all their various
local, trade union, Duma and all-Russia directing bodies, and
straightforwardly and publicly declared to the proletariat and to the world
at large: Malinovsky did not give us the reasons for his resignation, nor
did he give us any warning of it. This inexplicable behaviour, this act of
unprecedented insubordination, makes his conduct that of a deserter at a
time when we are waging a grim, arduous and responsible class struggle. We
have judged the deserter and ruthlessly condemned him. There is no more to
be said about it. The case is closed.  

“One person is nothing. The class is everything. Stick to your
guns. We are with you” (telegram sent by forty Moscow shop assistants to
the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group. See Put Pravdy No. 86,
May 14, 1914).  

The case is closed. The organised workers saw it through to the end in
an organised manner, then closed their ranks for further
work. Forward, to work!  

But intellectualist circles behave differently. The “inexplicable”
affair does not induce them to deal with it in an organised manner
(not a single leading body of the liquidators or of their friends
came out with an open, straightforward and full appraisal of the merits
of the case!) but rouses scandal-mongering interest. Ah,
“here is something inexplicable!”—the gossips of intellectual society
are intrigued.  
 

The gossips have no facts whatever to go by. The scandal-mongers of
Martov’s circle are incapable of organised action, of calling
together a committee, collecting information of political interest or
significance, of verifying, analysing, jointly discussing, and formulating
an official and responsible decision for the guidance of the
proletariat. The gossips are incapable of doing anything like that.  

But then these intellectual gossips are past masters of the art of
scandal-mongering, of going to or from Martov (or other filthy slanderers
like him) and encouraging insidious rumours, or picking up and passing on
insinuations! Whoever has been hut once in the company of these
scandal-mongering intellectualist gossips will certainly (unless he is a
gossip himself) retain for the rest of his life disgust for these
despicable creatures.  

Each to his own. Every social stratum has its own way of life, its own
habits and inclinations. Every insect has its own weapon. Some insects
fight by excreting a foul-smelling liquid.  

The organised Marxist workers acted in an organised manner. They closed
in an organised manner the case of the unsanctioned resignation of a former
colleague, and carded on with their work, went on with the struggle in an
organised manner. The liquidationist intellectualist gossips could not and
did not go further than filthy gossip and slander.  

The organised Marxist workers at once recognised these gossips, from
the very first articles in Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, and at once
gave them the appraisal they fully deserved: “filthy slander”,
“contemptuously ignore them”. Not a shadow of belief in the “rumours”
circulated by Martov and Dan; a firm determination to ignore them, to
attach no importance to them.  

Incidentally, the workers, who were indignant with the liquidators,
referred in their resolutions to the liquidators in general. I believe it
would have been far more correct to name Martov and Dan, as was done in
Lenin’s
telegram,[15] and in some of the articles and resolutions. We have no
grounds for accusing all the liquidators and branding them
publicly for indulging in filthy slander. But for ten years, beginning with
their attempt to flout the will of the Second (1903) Party Congress, Martov
and Dan have repeatedly shown their

    

“style” of fighting by means of insinuations and filthy slander. It was
of no avail for these two individuals to try and hide behind the plea that
somebody or other was divulging the names of the actual editors of
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta. Nowhere has a word or a sound been
uttered about editorship, or actual editors.  

But the slanderers, whom the workers’ party knows from its ten years of
history, had to be named, and named they were.  

The slanderers tried to bamboozle the inexperienced, or those utterly
incapable of thinking for themselves, by means of the “plausible” demand
for an “unofficial” trial. They pleaded ignorance of anything definite,
asserted that they were not accusing anybody, that rumours were “not
enough” to ground a charge on, for they could serve only as a basis for
“investigation”!  

But the entire corpus delicti—to use a legal term—of
filthy slander consists in people circulating insidious, anonymous rumours
in the press, without mentioning a single honest citizen, or a single
reputable and responsible democratic body capable of vouching for the
truth of these rumours!  

That is the crux of the matter.  

Martov and Dan have long been known and repeatedly exposed as
slanderers. This has been spoken of dozens of times in the press
abroad. When Martov, in collaboration with and on the responsibility of
Dan, wrote the special libellous pamphlet, Saviours or Destroyers,
even the mild and cautious Kautsky, who has of late been greatly
given to making “concessions” to the liquidators, called it
“disgusting”.  

That is a fact long ago published in the press abroad.  

And after this, Martov and Dan want us to agree to an investigation
undertaken on their initiative, on the basis of their
slanderous statements, and with the participation of the very
groups that shield them!  

That is downright impudence, and sheer stupidity on the part of the
slanderers.  

We do not believe a single word of Dan’s and Martov’s. We
shall never agree to any “investigation” into insidious rumours
with the participation of the liquidators and the groups that help
them. This would mean covering up the

    

crime committed by Martov and Dan. We shall however thoroughly expose it to
the working class.  

When Martov and Dan, with their backers, the Bundists, Chkheidze and
Co., the August bloc members, etc., directly or indirectly call upon us to
conduct a joint “investigation” with them, we say in reply: “We do not
trust Martov and Dan. We do not regard them as honest citizens. We shall
treat them as despicable slanderers and nothing else.”  

Let those who shield Dan and Martov, or the weak-kneed intellectuals
who believe the “rumours” circulated by those gentlemen, bemoan the idea
of a bourgeois court. That does not frighten us. Against the blackmailers,
we are always and absolutely in favour of the bourgeois legality
of a bourgeois court.  

When a man says: “Give me a hundred rubles, otherwise I shall reveal
the fact that you are unfaithful to your wife and are living with
A.”—that is criminal blackmail. In such a case we are in favour of
appealing to a bourgeois court.  

When a Ann says: “Make political concessions to me, recognise me as an
equal member of the Marxist body, or else I shall spread rumours about
Malinovsky being an agent provocateur”—that is political blackmail.


In such a case we are in favour of appealing to a bourgeois court.


And this point of view was adopted by the workers themselves
who, as soon as they read the very first articles of Dan and Martov,
distrusted them, and did not say to themselves:
“Really, if Martov and Dan write about these ‘rumours’ they must be
true?” No, the workers grasped the point at once and said: “The
working class will ignore filthy slander.”  

Either make a direct charge backed by your signatures, so that a
bourgeois court may convict and punish you (there are no other means of
combating blackmail), or continue to carry the stigma of slanderers that
the representatives of the ten workers’ industrial organisations have
publicly placed upon you. That is the alternative that confronts you,
Messrs. Martov and Dan!  

A leading body investigated these rumours and pronounced them
absurd. The workers of Russia trust this body, and it will utterly
expose those who spread slander. Martov must not think that he
will remain unexposed.  
 

But, you will say, the political groups which defend the liquidators,
or oven partly sympathise with them, do not trust our leading body. Of
course they do not. We do not want them to trust us; and we shall not
take a single step that might suggest that we place the slightest
trust in them.  

We say: Gentlemen, members of the groups that trust Martov and
Dan, and want to “unite” with them, all of you August bloc people,
Trotskyists, Vperyodists, Bundists, and so on, and so forth, please come
out in the open and show your true colours! Either of two things,
gentlemen: 

Since you yourselves want to “unite” with Martov and Dan, and call
upon the workers to do so, that shows that you (unlike us) trust the
recognised leaders of the ideological political trend known as the
liquidators. Since you trust them and consider it possible to “unite”
with them, admit it and advocate it, then do something; don’t
merely talk about it!  

Either you call upon Dan and Martov (you trust them and they trust you)
to disclose the source of the “rumours”, investigate them yourselves, and
then publicly declare to the working class: We vouch for the fact that this
is not the silly scandal of gossips, or the spiteful insinuations of angry
liquidators, but weighty and serious evidence. When you do that
and prove that the moment these rumours arose, the liquidationist,
Plekhanovist, and other leading bodies examined them and immediately
informed the Pravdist leading body, we shall answer: Gentlemen, we are
convinced that you are mistaken and we shall prove that to you, but we
admit that you have behaved like honest democrats.  

Or else, you—leaders of “trends” and groups which call upon the
workers to unite with the liquidators—hide behind the backs of Dan and
Martov, allow them to utter as much slander as they please, refrain from
calling upon them to disclose their sources, and do not take the trouble
(and the political responsibility) to verify the truth of the
rumours.  

In that case we shall openly declare to the workers: Comrades, don’t
you see that all these group leaders are, aiding and
abetting these filthy slanderers?  

We shall see what the workers will decide.  

For the sake of illustration, we shall take a concrete case. When the
leading body, which is recognised by four-fifths

    

of the class-conscious workers of Russia, declared that it had investigated
the rumours and was absolutely convinced that they were utterly absurd (if
not worse), two groups made statements in the press:
(1) the group of Chkheidze, Chkhenkeli, Skobelev, Khaustov, Tulyakov,
Mankov and Jagiello;
(2) the August bloc people, i. e., the leading August body of the
liquidators.  

What did they say?  

Only that they had taken no part in the investigation
into the rumours conducted by the leading body of the Pravdists! That is
all they said!  

Let us consider this case.  

Let us suppose, firstly, that instead of the group of Chkheidze and
Co. we have honest democrats before us. Let us assume that these people had
elected Malinovsky as the vice-chairman of their Duma
group. Suddenly, rumours appear in the press, in the organ for which they
are politically responsible, to the effect that Malinovsky is an agent
provocateur!  

Can there possibly be two opinions about what the elementary and
bounden duty of all honest democrats should be under such circumstances?


Their duty should be immediately to appoint a committee from their own
ranks or anybody else they please, immediately to investigate the source of
these rumours, those who have spread them and when they did so; ascertain
the authenticity and grounds of these rumours, and then declare
publicly, straightforwardly and honestly to the working class: Comrades, we
have worked, we have investigated and we vouch for the fact that
this is a serious matter.  

That is what honest democrats would do. But to say nothing, to refrain
from any investigation, and to continue to bear responsibility for a press
organ that spreads insidious rumours means sinking to the lowest depths of
meanness and baseness, means behaving in a manner unworthy of an honest
citizen.  

Secondly, let us assume that instead of Chkheidze and Co. we have
before us aiders and abettors of filthy slander, who either heard
these insidious rumours from Martov or his friends but never thought of
taking them seriously (for who among those that have anything to do with
Social-Democratic

    

activity has not, scores of times, heard patently absurd “rumours” it
would be ridiculous to pay attention to?) or who heard nothing at all, but,
knowing the Dan and Martov “style”, preferred not to “get mixed up in
such a complicated and troublesome
business”[16] for fear of besmirching and disgracing themselves for the
rest of their lives by openly expressing belief in the truth of the rumours
spread in the press by Martov and Dan, but at the same time desired
surreptitiously to shield the latter.  

People like the ones we have taken in our second assumption would
behave precisely in the way Chkheidze and Co. did.  

The same applies fully to the August bloc men.  

Let the workers themselves choose one of these two assumptions; let
them examine and ponder over the conduct of Chkheidze and Co.  

Now let us examine Plekhanov’s behaviour. In issue No. 2 of
Yedinstvo he describes the liquidators’ articles on Malinovsky as
“outrageous” and “disgusting”, but he adds, obviously as a reproach to
the Pravdists: this is the fruit of your splitting tactics. “It’s
no use crying over spilt milk!”  

How is this behaviour of Plekhanov’s to be interpreted?  

If, despite the plain statement by Dan and Martov that they regarded
these rumours as true and authentic (otherwise they would not have demanded
an investigation), Plekhanov describes the liquidators’ articles as
outrageous and disgusting, it shows that he does not in the least trust Dan
and Martov! It shows that he, too, regards them as filthy
slanderers!  

If that were not the case, what reasonable grounds would there have
been for publicly describing as “disgusting”, articles written by people
who desire (as they claim) to promote the cause of democracy and of the
proletariat by exposing a grave and frightful evil, namely, agents
provocateurs?  

But if Plekhanov does not believe a single word of Martov’s and Dan’s,
if he regards them as filthy slanderers, how can he blame us
Pravdists for the methods of struggle employed by the liquidators who have
been expelled from the Party! How can he write: “It’s no use
crying over spilt milk.” This can only mean that he justifies Dan
and Martov on the grounds of the “split”!  
 

That is monstrous, but it is a fact.  

Plekhanov justifies filthy slanderers, whom he himself does
not trust in the least, on the grounds that the Pravdists are to blame for
having expelled these slanderers from the Party.  

This behaviour of Plekhanov’s (as he has already been told publicly by
a “group of Marxists” who were ready to believe him, but were soon
disillusioned in him), is a diplomatic defence of blackmailers, i. e., a
defence prompted by narrow circle diplomacy, which is objectively
tantamount to encouraging the blackmailers to continue with their
blackmailing.  

Since we—Martov and Dan must be arguing—succeeded at once in
getting the “anti-liquidationist” Plekhanov, who does not trust us, to
blame the Pravdists, even indirectly, even partly, for driving us
into this desperate struggle by their “split”, why ... why, let’s carry
on! Let’s continue on the same lines. Plekhanov encourages us to
hope that we shall obtain concessions as a reward for our
      blackmail![10]


The workers straightaway saw through Plekhanov s narrow circle
diplomacy. This was proved by the opinion the Moscow workers expressed
about issue No. 1 of Yedinstvo, and by the reply of the “group of
Marxists” who were inclined to trust Plekhanov but later called him a
“diplomat”.[17] Before very long Plekhanov’s narrow circle diplomacy
will be utterly exposed.  


In January 1912, representatives of the workers publicly and officially
expelled from the Party a definite group of liquidators headed by Martov
and Dan. Since then, in the course of two-and-a-half years, the workers of
Russia have

    

approved of this decision by a four-fifths majority, and adopt ed it as
their own. The blackmail and slander of Martov and Dan will not
induce the workers to “make concessions”, but will convince them more
firmly than ever that only without the liquidators and
against them is it possible to build up the workers’ “entire
Marxist body”, four-fifths of which has already been built.  


Everybody is now talking about the growth of the Russian workers’
political consciousness, about the fact that they them selves are now
handling all affairs connected with the workers’ party, and their greater
maturity and independence after the revolution. Trotsky and Plekhanov also
appeal to the workers against “intellectuals’ circles” or the
“factionalism of the intellectuals”. But—and this is a remarkable
circumstance!—as soon as mention is made of the objective facts
showing which political trend the present-day class-conscious
workers of Russia choose, approve of and create, Plekhanov, Trotsky and the
liquidators all change their ground and shout: These workers, the Pravdist
workers, who form the majority of the class-conscious workers in Russia,
follow the lead of Pravdism only because they are “bewildered”
(Borba No. 1, p. 6), are only “being swayed” by
“demagogy”, or factionalism, etc., etc.  

It follows, therefore, that the liquidators, Plekhanov, and Trotsky
recognise the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers,
not in the present, but in the future, only in the future event of
the workers agreeing with them, with the liquidators, Plekhanov, and
Trotsky!  

What amusing subjectivism! What an amusing dread of objective facts!
But if we are not to engage simply in mutual recriminations, accusing each
other of intellectualist parochialism, we must take the present
facts, the objective facts.  

The political education of the workers, which everybody admits is
making progress, is another thing which our conciliators, Plekhanov,
Trotsky and Co., talk about with amusing subjectivism. Plekhanov and
Trotsky are wavering between the two contending trends in the
Social-Democratic class movement and are ascribing to the workers their own

    

subjective vacillations, saying: The fact that the workers participate in
this conflict of trends is evidence of their ignorance; when they become
more enlightened they will stop fighting, will cease to be “factional”
(Plekhanov, like Trotsky, repeats “by force of habit” parrot-phrases such
as “factionalism”, although the Pravdists put an end to “factionalism in
January 1912, i. e., two-and-a-half years ago, by straight forwardly and
openly expelling the liquidators).  

The subjectivism of this appraisal of the situation by Plekhanov and
Trotsky is most glaring. Turn to history—after all, there is no harm in a
Marxist turning to the history of the movement!—and you will find a story
of nearly twenty years’ struggle against the bourgeois trends of
Economism (1895–1902), Menshevism (1903–08) and liquidationism
(1908–14). There can be no doubt whatever about the unbroken connection
and continuity between these three varieties of “bourgeois influence on
the proletariat”. It is a historical fact that the advanced workers of
Russia participated in this struggle and sided with the Iskrists against
the Economists, with the Bolsheviks against the Mensheviks (as Levitsky
himself was compelled to admit by the weight of objective facts),
and lastly, with Pravdism against liquidationism.  

The question arises: Does not this historical fact concerning the
mass Social-Democratic workers’ movement point to something more
important than the subjective and pious wishes of Plekhanov and Trotsky,
who for the last ten years have been giving themselves credit for their
failure to fall into step with the mass Social-Democratic workers’ trend?


The objective facts of the present period, taken from both
sources—the liquidationist and Pravdist—as well as the history of the
last twenty years, abundantly prove that the struggle against
liquidationism and the victory achieved over it is precisely the
result of the political education of the Russian workers and of the
formation of a genuine workers’ party which does not
yield to petty-bourgeois influences in a petty-bourgeois country.  

Plekhanov and Trotsky, who offer the workers their subjective pious
wishes for the avoidance of conflict (wishes which ignore both history and
the mass trends among the Social-Democrats), look upon the political
education of the

    

workers from the point of view of copy-book maxims. History has existed up
to now, but now it has ceased to exist—as Marx wittily retorted in his
criticism of
Proudhon.[18] Up to now, for twenty years, the workers have received
their political education solely in the course of the struggle against the
bourgeois trend of Economism and against the later varieties of a similar
trend, but now, after a couple of “copy-book” maxims about the
harmfulness of conflicts, maxims served up by Plekhanov and Trotsky,
history will cease, the mass roots of liquidationism (which owe their mass
character to the support of the bourgeoisie) will vanish, mass Pravdism
(which became a mass movement solely as a result of the “bewilderment” of
the workers!) will vanish, and something “real” will arise.... The
reasoning followed by Plekhanov and Trotsky is truly amusing!  

The workers can obtain real political education only in the course of a
sustained, consistent, all-out struggle of proletarian influences,
aspirations and trends against bourgeois influences, aspirations and
trends. Not even Trotsky will deny that liquidationism (like the
Economism of 1895–1902) is a manifestation of bourgeois influence on the
proletariat; as for Plekhanov, he himself, in the long-distant
past, fully a year-and-a-half or two-and-a-half years ago, defended the
Party decision which established this truth.  

But nowhere in the world have bourgeois influences on the workers ever
taken the form of ideological influences alone. When the bourgeoisie’s
ideological influence on the workers declines, is undermined or weakened,
the bourgeoisie everywhere and always resorts to the most
outrageous lies and slander. And every time that Martov and Dan flouted the
will of the majority of organised Marxists, every time they lacked the
weapon of the ideological struggle, they resorted to the weapon of
insinuation and slander.  

Till now, however, they have done this in conditions of exile abroad,
before a relatively limited “audience”, and often got away with it. But
this time they have come out before tens of thousands of Russian workers
and have immediately pulled up short. The “trick” of emigrants’ gossip
and slander has missed fire. The workers have already proved politically
educated enough to see at once the insincerity, the dishonesty of the
utterances of Martov and Dan from the very
    

character of these utterances, and they have denounced them
publicly, before the whole of Russia, as slanderers.  

The advanced workers of Russia have taken another step forward along
the road of political education by knocking out of the hands of
one bourgeois group (the liquidators) the weapon of slander.  

Neither the bourgeois alliance between Plekhanov and Trotsky, the
liquidationist leaders, and the Narodniks, nor the efforts of the liberal
press to proclaim it the duty of “honest” people to secure unity between
the workers and those who want to liquidate the workers’ party, nor the
campaign of slander conducted by Martov and Dan will check the growth and
development, of proletarian solidarity with the ideas, programme, tactics
and organisation of Pravdism.

issue No. 6 of Borba, he, a contributor to Nasha
Rabochaya Gazeta, does not utter a word in condemnation of the
“Campaign” conducted by Dan and Martov, but accuses the Pravdists of
sowing “the poisonous seeds of hatred and splitting” (p. 44)! Thus, not
slander, oh, no, but carrying out the Party’s decision concerning those who
are vehicles of bourgeois influence and who hurl abuse at the
“underground” must he regarded as “poison”. Very well, we shall place
this on record.  —Lenin
 



[11]
Lenin is referring to the attack by the bourgeois counter-revolution
against the working class and the democratic petty bourgeoisie in France,
after the latter’s defeat in June 1849.  

The reference to 1871 is about the rising of the Paris workers on
March 18, 1871, as a result of which a government of the proletarian
dictatorship—the Paris Commune—was created for the first time in
history. The Commune was defeated. “The entire bourgeoisie of France, all
the landlords, stockbrokers, factory owners, all the robbers, great and
small, all the exploiters” united against it in savage fury. (See present
edition, Vol. 17, pp. 140–41.) With active aid from Bismarck, this
coalition started military operations against insurgent Paris, and, on
winning victory, flooded the streets of the city with the blood of the
people. No less than 30,000 Communards were killed and 50,000
arrested. Many of these were executed and thousands were condemned to penal
servitude or exile.  

The Paris Commune is dealt with in Lenin’s articles: “Plan of a
Lecture on the Commune”, “Lessons of the Commune”, “In Memory of the
Commune”, The State and Revolution, Ch. III. (See present
edition, Vols. 8, 13, 17, 25.)





[12]
See Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol. 1, Moscow, 1952,
pp. 54–64.





[13]
The Peasant Union (The All-Russia Peasant Union)—a
revolutionary-democratic organisation, which arose in 1905. Influenced by
the Socialist-Revolutionaries and liberals, the Peasant Union

   

displayed a half-way policy, vacillations and indecision typical of the
petty-bourgeoisie. While demanding the abolition of landlordism, the Union
agreed to partial compensation for the land lords. In the words of Lenin,
this was “organisation, sharing, of course, in a number of peasant
prejudices, and susceptible to the petty-bourgeois illusions of the
peasants (just like our Socialist-Revolutionaries); but it was undoubtedly,
a real organisation of the masses, of ‘men of the soil’, unquestionably
revolutionary at bottom, capable of employing genuinely revolutionary
methods of struggle.” (See present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 258–59.) From
the very outset of its activities the Peasant Union was subject to police
repression and discontinued its activities early in 1907.





[14]
L’Humanité—a daily newspaper founded in 1904 by Jean
Jaurès as the organ of the French Socialist Party. The newspaper
hailed the beginning of the revolution in Russia in 1905 and expressed the
sympathy of the French people “with the Russian nation, which was
effecting its 1789”. The newspaper organised collections in support of the
Russian revolution. During the First World War (1914–18) the paper was
controlled by the extreme Right wing of the French Socialist Party and took
a chauvinist stand.  

In 1918, Marcel Cachin, a prominent leader of the French and
international labour movement, became political director and head of the
newspaper. In 1918–20, the paper came out against the imperialist policy
of the French Government and its sending of armed forces-against the Soviet
Republic. In December 1920, after the split in the French Socialist Party
and the formation of the Communist Party of France, the newspaper became
the latter’s Central Organ.  

At the beginning of World War II, in August 1939, the newspaper was
banned by the French authorities and went underground. During the Nazi
occupation of France (1940–44) the newspaper appeared illegally and played
a tremendous role in the liberation of France.  

In the post-war period the newspaper has been waging a cease less
struggle for the country’s national independence, for unity of
working-class action, for strengthening peace and friendship among the
nations, and for democracy and social progress.





[15]
Lenin’s telegram demanding that Martov and Dan should make a signed and
open accusation and not engage in spreading dark rumours was published in
the newspaper Rabochy No. 4, May 25, 1914.





[16]
Lenin, with slight modifications, is quoting from the poem The Man
of the Forties by the Russian poet Nekrasov.





[17]
Following the slanderous anti-Bolshevik attacks by the liquidationist
Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, a group of Marxists asked Plekhanov to
make a statement to the International Socialist Bureau

   

condemning the newspaper’s behaviour. Though he strongly disapproved of
this behaviour, Plekhanov refused to make the required statement, thereby
justifying the slanderers. Thereupon, the “Group of Marxists” published a
“Statement” in the newspaper Trudovaya Pravda on June 5 (18),
1914, in which Plekhanov’s conduct was characterised as “an act of high
diplomacy”.

The St. Petersburg liquidators’ newspaper has published an
article by A. Bogdanov containing the sharpest accusations against
Pravda and Pravdism. The journal run by Trotsky, who yesterday was
the dose friend of the liquidators and today has half deserted them, has
now published a letter (No. 4, p. 56) from the Paris and Geneva circles of
the Vperyod ideological and Marxist group.  

In Russia only a single group—in the Caucasus—has come out in
defence of this Paris-Geneva group, which has been in existence since 1909,
i. e., for about five years. In view of this, it would seem a waste of time
to add anything to the explanations already given in Put
     Pravdy.[1]


However, the persistence of the liquidators and their quondam friend
Trotsky in defending the Vperyod group impels us to reply to them
once again, the more so that the accumulating evidence of an actual
alliance between the liquidators, Trotsky and the Vperyod people
affords an opportunity of explaining to the workers in Russia the political
significance of this alliance from the standpoint of principle.  

The Vperyod group broke away from the Bolsheviks abroad in
1909. At the end of that year it issued a pamphlet entitled: The
Present Moment and the Tasks of the Party, in which the “platform”
of this group was expounded.  


   “In the work of drafting this platform,” we read on
   page 32 of this pamphlet, “fifteen Party members participated, of whom
   seven were workers and eight intellectuals. The major part of the platform
   was adopted unanimously. Only on the question of the Duma did three abstain
   (two otzovists and one ‘anti-boycottist’).”  


This platform (p. 17 and others) defended “proletarian philosophy”.

 

Of the names of Vperyodists whom the latter themselves have mentioned
in the press, we shall mention the following:
N. Maximov, Voinov, Alexinsky, Lunacharsky, Lyadov, S. A. Volsky, Domov and
=

A. Bogdanov.[2] 

What has become of these Vperyodists?  

N. Maximov has left the Vperyod group.  

Voinov and Alexinsky remained in the group, but later fell out with
each other and now belong to two different Vperyod
groups. This was officially announced in Paris.  

A. Lunacharsky has fallen out with Alexinsky.  

Lyadov has evidently left the group; nothing is known of his attitude
towards the new split in the Vperyod group.  

S. A. Volsky has gone over to the Left Narodniks, judging from his
regular contributions to the latter’s publications (see Zavety).


Domov published, in Vperyod No. 3 (May 1911), a statement that
“he was no longer taking any part whatever in the publications of the
Vperyod group” (p. 78).  

A. Bogdanov has announced in the press that he has left the
Vperyod group.  

Such are the facts.  

And now compare these facts with the statement of the Paris and Geneva
Vperyodists published by Trotsky: 


   “The assertion by Put Pravdy that, from the
   moment it came into being, the Vperyod group consisted of
   heterogeneous anti-Marxist elements loosely stuck together, and fell to
   pieces with the revival of the working-class movement, does not correspond
   to the facts.”  


The reader will see from this that the Vperyodists’ statement published
by Trotsky, who is perfectly familiar with all the names we have mentioned
and with the entire history of the Vperyod group, which he has
assisted on more than one occasion, is an outrageous and glaring falsehood,
and that what Put Pravdy said was the absolute truth.  

We shall also recall the following fact. Sovremenny Mir, in
1910 or 1911 I think, published a review by G. A. Alexinsky of a book by
A. A. Bogdanov, in which the latter was referred to as a “gentleman” who
had nothing in common with Marxism.  

How is this to be explained?  

It is to be explained by the fact that the Vperyodists were really a
group of heterogeneous, anti-Marxist elements,

    

loosely stuck together. As regards ideological trend, there were
two such elements there, Machism and otzovism, which,
incidentally, is evident from the passages quoted above.  

Machism is the philosophy of Mach and Avenarius, modified by
Bogdanov. It is advocated by Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and Volsky, and is
concealed in the Vperyod platform under the pseudonym of
“proletarian philosophy”. In effect, this philosophy is a species of
philosophical idealism, i. e., a subtle defence of religion, and it was no
accident that Lunacharsky has slipped from this philosophy into advocating
a blending of scientific socialism with religion. Even today, A. Bogdanov,
in a number of “new” books, defends this utterly anti-Marxist and utterly
reactionary philosophy, which both the Menshevik G. V. Plekhanov and the
Bolshevik
V. Ilyin[3] have strongly opposed.  

We now ask all and sundry whether the liquidators A. Bogdanov, Trotsky
and the Paris-Geneva Vperyodists acted honestly when, in publishing
statements by Vperyod and about Vperyod, they
concealed from the Russian workers: 

1)
the fact that the Vperyod group itself included “proletarian
philosophy”, i. e., “Machism”, in its platform; 

2)
the fact that Marxists belonging to different groups waged a long and
persistent struggle against “Machism” as an out-and-out reactionary
philosophy; 

3)
the fact that even Alexinsky, that ardent Vperyodist, who signed this
platform jointly with the Machists, was some time later compelled to
protest in the sharpest possible terms against Machism.  

We shall now deal with otzovism.  

We have seen above that the otzovists belonged to the Vperyod
group. This group’s platform—as was pointed out immediately it appeared
in the press abroad—contained a veiled form of otzovism and unpardonable
concessions to it, for example, in point d), on p. 16 of the platform,
where it says that (for a certain period) 


   “none of the semi-legal and legal ways and means of
   struggle of the working class, including participation in the Duma, can be
   of independent and decisive importance”.  


This is the same old otzovism, only veiled, vague and confused. Both
the Party Bolsheviks, i. e., those opposed

    

to liquidationism, and the pro-Party Mensheviks have repeatedly explained
that such a platform is unacceptable to Social-Democrats, that it is a
defence of otzovism, utterly fallacious and most harmful.  

The otzovists were opposed to going into the Third Duma, but events
clearly showed that they were mistaken, and that, in fact, their
point of view led to anarchism.  

The veiled and modified defence of otzovism that we have quoted could
not, in practice, have resulted in the line which Pravda
successfully pursued, and which led the Pravdists to victory over the
disruptors of the Party, the liquidators, in the vast majority of the legal
and ultra-legal working-class organisations.  

That is why, when the Vperyodists to this day talk of “uncurtailed
Left Marxism”, it is our duty to speak up and warn the workers; it is our
duty to declare that these fine words contain an anti-Marxist doctrine
which will cause immense harm to the working-class movement, and is
absolutely incompatible with the latter.  

This Vperyodist species of “uncurtailed Left Marxism” is a travesty
of Bolshevism, as the Bolsheviks said and proved long back, over five years
ago. Even if the Vperyodists have failed to realise it, we virtually have
here a deviation from Marxism towards anarchism.  

The Plenum of January 1910—the very Plenum which the Vperyodists
refer to in Trotsky’s journal as having endorsed their
group—unanimously condemned this deviation as being just as
harmful as the liquidators’ deviation. Throughout 1910 the leading bodies
set up by the Plenum to carry out its decisions, for example, the Editorial
Board of the Central
Organ,[4] repeatedly and at great length point ed out in the
columns of their publications that the Vperyodists, like the liquidators,
were violating the decisions of the Plenum, and that, like the
liquidators, they were in fact vehicles of bourgeois influence on the
proletariat.  

Since, in Trotsky’s journal, the Vperyodists now refer to the “first
and second Vperyod schools”, we feel bound to recall the
facts. Half the workers left the first school because experience
had convinced them of its anti-Marxist and disruptive character. As regards
the second school, the Central Organ, in pursuance of the decisions of the
Plenum,

    

made a point of warning the workers against it and explained that it bore
the character just mentioned.  

But who helped this second school?  

Only the liquidators and Trotsky, notwithstanding the official
warning given by the Party’s official organ.  

In this second school we plainly see a bloc, an alliance, between the
liquidators, the Vperyodists and Trotsky’s group exactly like the one we
now see in the columns of the St. Petersburg liquidationist newspaper and
in Trotsky’s Borba.  

This is an alliance of anti-Marxist and disruptive groups, which detest
Pravda’s Marxism and the comradely Party discipline which rallies
the vast majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia around
Pravda.  

We cannot but call “adventurism” this alliance, like the
Vperyod group itself, and Vperyodism as a whole, for nothing can
come of Vperyodism and of its “bloc” with Trotsky and the liquidators
except disregard of principles, the encouragement of anti-Marxist ideas
(without openly preaching them), and the disruption of the working-class
movement.  

But while being basically and unswervingly opposed to Vperyod
and Vperyodism, we have never, and never shall, shut the door against those
Vperyodists who (like the majority of the founders of Vperyod) are
leaving that group and intend to help the majority of Russia’s
class-conscious workers, organised and united by Pravdism. No leniency what
ever must be shown towards the defence of Machism (from which,
unfortunately, Bogdanov won’t budge), or of Vperyodism; but no obstacles
should be put in the way of comrades who have conscientiously recognised
Vperyod’s mistake and are turning from Vperyod back
to the Party.  

As regards the attacks and abuse to which “those writers Ilyin,
Zinoviev and Kamenev” are subjected by Bogdanov in the liquidators’
newspaper and by the Vperyodists in Trotsky’s journal, we shall state
briefly that these writers have always carried out the decisions
of the organised Marxist workers, who have demonstrated to all the world by
their solidarity with Pravdism or by their votes in the election of the
Metropolitan and All-Russia Insurance Boards, that they constitute the
overwhelming majority of the organised and class-conscious workers of
Russia.  
 

Acting in accordance with these decisions and in keeping with their
spirit, these writers have every reason to consider that their activities
are in harmony with the will of the majority of the Marxist workers, and
they will not of course be deterred from their activities by abuse coming
from the Vperyodists, Trotsky and the liquidators.  

The history of the Vperyod group, of its break-up, and its
repeated blocs with Trotsky and the liquidators, is a matter of some
general interest to the workers, and even of some public interest, for it
represents a typical case of isolated groups of intellectuals being formed
in the period of break down and disintegration. Anybody is at liberty to
form a separate ideological group and to point out a different road to the
proletariat, but much will be expected of any founder of a new group. It
goes without saying that nobody can be blamed for making mistakes, but to
persist in mistakes that have been explained both by the theory
and the practice of a movement of over five years is tantamount to waging
war against Marxism, against the organised and united majority of the
workers.  

The vacillations and deviations of the liquidators and Vperyodists are
no accident; they have been engendered by the period of break-down and
disintegration. We see these bourgeois deviations on both sides of the road
of the class struggle of the Marxist workers, and these serve as a warning
to every class-conscious worker.  


P. S. The above lines were already written when we received a copy of
Trotsky’s Borba containing another letter from “the Geneva, Paris
and Tiflis Vperyod Marxist circles and from St. Petersburg
fellow-thinkers”.  

From the signatures to this letter we see that during these four and a
half years the Vperyodists, who issued “their own” platform at
the very end of 1909, have acquired in Russia one “Tiflis
circle” and probably two “St. Petersburg fellow thinkers”
(three would no doubt have constituted a St. Petersburg, or metropolitan,
or all-Russia, Marxist ideological circle!). To anyone more or less
seriously interested in politics, this result of Vperyod’s four
years of “activity” should suffice to serve as a criterion of this
group. Let

    

Trotsky amuse himself by uniting with it in the columns of his
“own” sheet; let the Vperyodists and Trotskyists play at being
“powers”, “trends”, and contracting parties. This is simply the
childish make-believe of people who, by uttering pompous phrases, want to
conceal the fact that their “groups” are mere bubbles.  

It is amusing to read how these groups vociferate about unity and
splits!  Don’t you understand, gentlemen, that there can only be a question
of the unity of the mass working-class movement, the unity of the workers’
party; as for unity with groups of intellectuals, who in the course of four
years have found no support among the workers of Russia, you and Trotsky
can chatter to your heart’s content about that! That is not worth arguing
about.

Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P.—the illegal newspaper
Sotsial Demokrat, published from February 1908 to
January 1917. Prepared by the Bolsheviks and partially printed in Vilna at
a private press, the first issue was confiscated by the tsarist Okhranka
(Secret Political Police). Shortly afterwards another attempt to issue the
newspaper was made in St. Petersburg, but the bulk of the edition fell into
the hands of the security police. Further publication was arranged
abroad. Issues Nos. 2–32 (February 1909 to December 1913) appeared in
Paris, Nos. 35–58 (November 1914 to January 1917) in Geneva. Altogether
fifty-eight issues were published, five of them with supplements.  

According to the decision of the Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. elected at the Fifth (London) Congress, the Editorial Board of
Sotsial-Demokrat consisted of representatives of the Bolsheviks,
Mensheviks and the Polish Social-Democrats. Actually, the paper was
conducted by Lenin, whose articles were a central feature in it. Over
eighty articles and paragraphs by Lenin were published in the newspaper.


Lenin fought for a consistent Bolshevik line against the Menshevik
liquidators on the Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat. Some of
its members (Kamenev and Zinoviev) adopted a conciliatory attitude towards
the liquidators and opposed Lenin’s line. The Menshevik members of the
editorial board—Martov and Dan—obstructed the work of the editorial
staff of the Central Organ while at the same time openly defending
liquidationism in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata; they prevented the
pro-Party Mensheviks from taking part in the work of the Central
Organ. Lenin’s uncompromising struggle against the liquidators led to
Martov and Dan resigning from the editorial board in June 1911. From
December 1911 Sotsial-Demokrat was edited by Lenin.  

During the grim years of reaction and the period of a new up swing in
the revolutionary movement Sotsial-Demokrat was a factor of
tremendous importance in the Bolsheviks’ struggle against the liquidators,
Trotskyists, and otzovists for the preservation of the illegal Marxist
party, and strengthening its unity and contacts with the masses.  


During World War I Sotsial-Demokrat was the Central Organ of
the Bolshevik Party, in which capacity it played a vital part in
propagating Bolshevik slogans on the issues of war, peace and
revolution. The newspaper published Lenin’s article “The Slogan of a
United States of Europe”, in which for the first time he formulated the
conclusion that it was possible for socialism to win initially in a few or
even in a single capitalist country. The circulation of
Sotsial-Demokrat in Russia and the reprinting of its most
important articles in the local Bolshevik papers contributed to the
political enlightenment and international education of the Russian
proletariat, and the preparation of the masses for the revolution.  

Lenin highly appreciated the services that Sotsial-Demokrat
rendered during World War I, and wrote later that “no class-conscious
worker who wishes to understand the evolution of the idea of the
international socialist revolution and its first victory of October 25,
1917” can dispense with a study of the articles published in it. (See
present edition, Vol. 27, “Foreword to the symposium Against the
Stream.)

We have much pleasure in publishing the appeal of our
comrade, a Ukrainian Marxist, to the Ukrainian, class-conscious
workers. Unity irrespective of nation. This call is particularly urgent in
Russia at the present time. The petty-bourgeois intellectuals of
Dzvin, the workers’ evil counsellors, are trying as hard as they
can to drive a wedge between the Ukrainian and the Great-Russian
Social-Democratic workers. Dzvin is serving the cause of the
nationalist petty bourgeoisie.  

We shall, however, serve the cause of the international workers: we
shall rally, unite and merge the workers of all nations for united and
joint activities.  

Long live the close fraternal alliance of the workers of the Ukrainian,
Great-Russian and all other nations of Russia!

“Appeal to the Ukrainian Workers”, in the Ukrainian language
signed by Ocksen Lola, and published in the newspaper Trudovaya
Pravda No. 28 for June 29, 1914, called upon the workers to unite
irrespective of nation in order to fight capital and to arrange for the
publication under the auspices of Trudovaya Pravda of a
“Ukrainian Workers’ Leaflet”.  

The “Appeal” was drafted by Lenin in Russian in the spring of 1914
and forwarded to 0. N. Lola through Inessa Armand. The “Appeal” was
intended for the Miners’ Leaflet—a supplement to the newspaper
Put Pravdy. Lenin considered it important for the “Appeal” to be
issued by Lola in Ukrainian in order, that a voice be raised precisely
among the Ukrainian Social-Democrats calling for unity against the division
of the workers by nation. The “Ukrainian Workers’ Leaflet” was
not published.

Before proceeding to the report on behalf of the Central
Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, I shall first of
all take this opportunity of performing a pleasant duty, and on behalf of
that body express profound thanks to Comrade Vandervelde, Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau, for visiting our
country and making himself personally acquainted with the leaders of the
working-class movement in St. Petersburg. We are particularly grateful to
Comrade Vandervelde for being the first to establish direct contact between
prominent members of the International and the class-conscious and leading
workers of Russia, and also for publishing in the foreign socialist press
(we have in mind Le Peuple and l’Hutmanité)
objective data on the working-class movement in Russia, data collected on
the spot from the editors of the newspapers of the three trends, namely the
Pravdist (i. e., our Party), the liquidationist and the
Socialist-Revolutionary trends.  

I shall divide my report on the question of the unity of the Russian
Social-Democratic movement into the following four parts:
(1) first, I shall explain the gist of the main differences among
the Social-Democrats;
(2) I shall then quote data concerning the mass working-class movement in
Russia, showing how our Party line has been tested by the experience of
this movement;
(3) I shall explain how the line and position of our opponents have been
tested by the same experience. Fourth and last, I shall formulate, on
behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
Party, concrete, positive and practical proposals for unity.  
I

There are two bodies of opinion on what is at present taking place in
the Russian Social-Democratic movement.  
 

One opinion, expounded by Rosa Luxemburg in the proposal she made to
the International Socialist Bureau last year (December 1913) and shared by
the liquidators and the groups which support them, is as follows:
in Russia the “chaos” of factional strife reigns among a multitude of
factions, the worst of which, namely, the Leninist faction, is most active
in fomenting a split. Actually, the differences do not preclude the
possibility of joint activities. The road to unity lies through agreement
or compromise among all trends and groups.  

The other opinion, which we hold, is that there is nothing resembling
“chaos of factional strife” in Russia. The only thing we have
there is a struggle against the liquidators, and it is only in the
course of this struggle that a genuinely workers’
Social-Democratic Party is being built up, which has already united the
overwhelming majority—four-fifths—of the class-conscious
workers of Russia. The illegal Party, in which the majority of the workers
of Russia are organised, has been represented by the following conferences:
the January Conference of 1912, the February Conference of 1913, and the
Summer Conference of 1913. The legal organ of the Party is the newspaper
Pravda (Vérité), hence the name
Pravdist. Incidentally, this opinion was expressed by the St. Petersburg
worker who, at a banquet in St. Petersburg which Comrade Vandervelde
attended, stated that the workers in the factories of St. Petersburg are
united, and that outside of this unity of the workers there are only
“general staffs without armies”.  

In the second part of my report I shall deal with the objective data
which prove that ours is the correct opinion. And now I shall deal with the
substance of liquidationism.  

The liquidationist groups were formally expelled from the Party at the
R.S.D.L.P. Conference in January 1912, but the question of liquidationism
was raised by our Party much earlier. A definite official resolution,
binding upon the whole Party and unreservedly condemning liquidationism,
was adopted by the All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. held as far back
as December 1908. In this resolution liquidationism is defined as
follows: 

(Liquidationism is) “an attempt on the part of some of the Party
intelligentsia to liquidate the existing organisation

    

of the R.S.D.L.P. and to substitute for it an amorphous federation acting
at all cost within the limits of legality, even at the cost of openly
abandoning the programme, tactics and traditions of the Party”.  

From this it is evident that as far back as 1908
liquidationism was officially declared and recognised as an
intellectualist trend, and that in substance it stood for the
renunciation of the illegal Party and the substitution,
or advocacy of the substitution, of a legal party for it.  

The Central Committee’s plenary meeting held in January 1910
once again unanimously condemned liquidationism as “a
manifestation of the influence of the bourgeoisie on the
proletariat”.  

From this we see how mistaken is the opinion that our differences with
the liquidators are no deeper and are less important than those between the
so-called radicals and moderates in Western Europe. There is not a
single—literally not a single—West-European party that has ever had
occasion to adopt a general party decision against people who desired to
dissolve the party and to substitute a new one for it!


Nowhere in Western Europe has there ever been, nor can there ever be, a
question of whether it is permissible to bear the title of party member
and at the same time advocate the dissolution of that party, to
argue that the party is use less and unnecessary, and that another party be
substituted for it. Nowhere in Western Europe does the question concern the
very existence of the party as it does with us, i. e., whether
that party is to be or not to be.  

This is not disagreement over a question of organisation, of
how the party should be built, but disagreement concerning the
very existence of the party. Here, conciliation, agreement and
compromise are totally out of the question.  

We could not have built up our Party (to the extent of four-fifths) and
cannot continue to build it otherwise than by relentlessly fighting those
publicists who in the legal press fight against the “underground” (i.e.,
the illegal Party), declare it to be an “evil”, justify and
eulogise desertion from it, and advocate the formation of an “open
party”.  

In present-day Russia, where even the party of the extremely moderate
liberals is not legal, our Party can exist only

    

as an illegal party. The exceptional and unique feature of our position,
which somewhat resembles that of the German Social-Democrats under the
Anti-Socialist
Law[8] (although, even then, the Germans enjoyed a hundred times more
legality than we do in Russia), is that our illegal Social-Democratic
Labour Party consists of illegal workers’ organisations (often
called “cells”) which are surrounded by a more or less dense network of
legal workers’ associations (such as sick insurance societies,
trade unions, educational associations, athletic clubs, temperance
societies, and so forth). Most of these legal associations exist in the
metropolis; in many parts of the provinces there are none at all.  

Some of the illegal organisations are fairly large, others are quite
small and in some cases they consist only of “trusted

agents”.[9] 

The legal associations serve to some extent as a screen for
the illegal organisations and for the extensive, legal advocacy of the idea
of working-class solidarity among the masses. Nation-wide contacts between
the leading working class organisations, the maintenance of a centre (the
Central Committee) and the passing of precise Party resolutions on all
questions—all these are of course carried out quite illegally and call
for the utmost secrecy and trustworthiness on the part of advanced and
tested workers.  

To come out in the legal press against the “underground” or
in favour of an “open party” is simply to disrupt our Party, and
we must regard the people who do this as bitter enemies of our
Party.  

Naturally, repudiation of the “underground” goes hand in hand with
repudiation of revolutionary tactics and advocacy of reformism. Russia is
passing through a period of bourgeois revolutions. In Russia even the most
moderate bourgeois—the Cadets and Octobrists—are decidedly dissatisfied
with the government. But they are all enemies of revolution and detest us
for “demagogy”, for striving again to lead the masses to the barricades
as we did in 1905. They are all bourgeois who advocate only “reforms” and
spread among the masses the highly pernicious idea that reform is
compatible with the present tsarist monarchy.  

Our tactics are different. We make use of every reform (insurance, for
example) and of every legal society. But we

    

use them to develop the revolutionary consciousness and the revolutionary
struggle of the masses. In Russia, where political freedom to this day does
not exist, these words have far more direct implications for us than they
have in Europe. Our Party conducts revolutionary strikes, which in
Russia are growing as in no other country in the world. Take, for example,
the month of May alone. In May 1912, 64,000 and in May 1914, 99,000 workers
were involved in economic strikes.  

The number involved in political strikes was: 364,000 in 1912 and
(347,000 in 1914. The combination of political and economic struggle
produces the revolutionary strike, which, by rousing the peasant millions,
trains them for revolution. Our Party conducts campaigns of
revolutionary meetings and revolutionary street
demonstrations. For this purpose our Party distributes
revolutionary leaflets and an illegal newspaper, the
Party’s Central Organ. The ideological unification of all these propaganda
and agitation activities among the masses is achieved by the slogans
adopted by the supreme bodies of our Party, namely:
(1) an eight-hour day;
(2) confiscation of the landed estates, and
(3) a democratic republic. In the present situation in Russia, where
absolute tyranny and despotism prevail and where all laws are suppressed by
the tsarist monarchy, only these slogans can effectually unite and
direct the entire propaganda and agitation of the Party aimed at
effectually sustaining the revolutionary working-class movement.  

It amuses us to hear the liquidators say, for example, that we are
opposed to “freedom of association”, for we not only emphasised the
importance of this point of our programme in a special resolution adopted
by the January Conference of 1912, but we made ten times more effective use
of the curtailed right of association (the insurance societies, for
example) than the liquidators did. But when people tell us in the legal
press that the slogans of confiscation of the land and of a republic cannot
serve as subjects for agitation among the masses, we say that there can be
no question of our Party’s unity with such people, and such a
group of publicists.  

Since the purpose of this first part of my report is to explain the
gist of our differences, I shall say no more on this

    

point, except to remind you that the fourth part of my re port will contain
practical proposals, with an exact list of all the cases where the
liquidators have departed from our Party’s programme and decisions.  

I shall not here go into the details of the history of the liquidators’
breakaway from our illegal Party, the R.S.D.L.P., but will merely
indicate the three main periods of this history.  

First period: from the autumn of 1908 to January 1910. The Party
combated liquidationism with the aid of precise, official, Party decisions
condemning it.  

Second period: from January 1910 to January 1912. The liquidators
hindered the work of restoring the Central Committee of the Party;
they disrupted the Central Committee of the Party and dismissed
the last remnants of it, namely, the Technical Commission of the
Bureau Abroad of the Central
Committee.[10] The Party committees in Russia then
(autumn 1911) set up the Russian Organising
Commission[11] for the purpose of restoring the Party. That Commission
convened the January Conference of 1912. The Conference restored the Party,
elected a Central Committee and expelled the liquidationist group from the
Party.  

Third period: from January 1912 to the present time. The specific
feature of this period is that a majority of four-fifths of the
class-conscious workers of Russia have rallied around the decisions and
bodies created by the January Conference of 1912.  

I now come to the second part of my report, in which I shall describe
the present state of our Party and of the liquidators in the light of the
mass working-class movement in Russia. I shall try to answer the question:
does the experience of the mass movement confirm the correctness
of our Party’s line or of the liquidators’ line?  
II

On April 22, 1912 (old style) the working-class daily, Pravda,
began to appear in Russia, thanks to the restoration of the Party
at the January Conference of 1912; this newspaper is pursuing the line
(often by hints and always in a curtailed form) laid down by that
Conference.

    

Obviously, we never mention in any organ of the press the illegal
connection that exists between the Party’s illegal Conference of January
1912 and the Central Committee it set up, on the one hand, and the legal
newspaper Pravda, on the other. In September 1912, the rival
newspaper of the liquidators, Luch, now called Nasha Rabochaya
Gazeta, began to appear. Then, in the autumn of 1912, the Fourth Duma
elections took place. In 1913, a new insurance law came into force in
Russia, establishing sick funds for the workers. Lastly, the legal trade
unions, relentlessly persecuted by the government and repeatedly
suppressed, were, nevertheless, constantly revived.  

It is not difficult to understand that all these manifestations of the
mass working-class movement—especially the daily newspapers of
the two trends—provide a vast amount of public, verifiable, and
objective data. We deem it our duty to the Executive Committee of
the International Socialist Bureau emphatically to protest against the
habit of the liquidators and their defenders abroad of making
unsubstantiated statements, assurances and declamations, while
ignoring the objective facts of the mass working-class movement in
Russia.  

It is these facts that have definitely strengthened us in our
conviction that the line we are pursuing is the right one.  

In January 1912 the Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., which restored the
illegal Party, was held. The liquidators and the groups abroad (including
Plekhanov) greeted it with abuse. But what about the workers in Russia?


The answer to this question was provided by the Fourth Duma elections.


These elections were held in the autumn of 1912. Whereas in the Third
Duma 5O per cent (four out of eight) of the deputies elected by
the worker curia belonged to our trend, in the Fourth Duma six out of nine,
i.e., 67 per cent, of the deputies elected by the worker curia
were supporters of the Party. This proves that the masses of the workers
sided with the Party and rejected liquidationism. If the six members of the
Duma, who incline towards liquidationism, now really desire unity with the
Party group in the Duma, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
group, then we are

    

obliged to say that recognition of the fact that these deputies are
carrying out the will of the majority of the workers is the condition for
unity.  

To proceed. Daily newspapers are extremely important media of
working-class organisation. They contain a vast amount of material
proving this, i.e., the figures showing the number of contributions
received from workers’ groups. Both newspapers, the Pravdist (i.e.,
the Party) and the liquidationist, publish reports of financial
contributions received from workers’ groups. These reports are, for Russia,
the best conceivable index—public and legal—of the actual state of
organisation of the masses of the workers.  

In Western Europe, where the socialist parties are legal, the number of
party members is known to everybody, and discussions concerning the
organised working-class movement are always based on these figures.  

In Russia we have no open, i.e., legal party. The Party’s organisations
are illegal, secret, “underground”, as we say. But an
indirect—and also unerring—index of the state of these
organisations is provided by the number of financial contributions
received from workers’ groups.  

These figures have been published openly and regularly in both
newspapers—for over two years in ours and over eighteen months in the
liquidators’—and if any false claim or mistake were made it would
immediately have called forth a protest on the part of the workers
themselves. Consequently, these figures are absolutely reliable
and are the best public and legal index of the state of organisation of the
masses of the workers.  

Our liquidators, and the groups abroad which defend them, persistently
ignore these figures, and say nothing about them in their press; but our
workers merely regard this as evidence of their desire to flout the
will of the majority of the workers, as evidence of their lack of
honesty.  

Here are the figures for the whole of 1913. The Pravdists
received 2,181 money contributions from workers’ groups, while the
liquidators received 661. In 1914 (up to May 13), the Pravdists had the
support of 2,873 workers’ groups, and the liquidators, of 671. Thus, the
Pravdists organised 77 per cent of the workers’ groups in 1913, and 81
per cent in 1914.  
 

The Pravdists have been publishing these figures regularly since 1912,
inviting investigation, pointing to their objective character, and calling
upon the genuine (not hypocritical) friends of “unity”
straightforwardly and honestly to submit to the will of the majority of the
workers. Failing this, all their talk about unity is sheer
hypocrisy.  

After the liquidators had been fighting the Party for eighteen months,
the class-conscious workers of Russia, by a four-fifths majority,
approved of the Pravda line and demonstrated their
loyalty to the “underground” and to revolutionary tactics. What we expect
from the liquidators and their friends is not phrases about “unity”
against the Party’s will, but a straightforward answer to the
question:
do they or do they not accept the will of the vast majority of the
class-conscious workers of Russia?  

It is easy to give empty assurances, but it is very difficult to
organise a genuine working-class newspaper that is really maintained by the
workers. All the foreign comrades know this, and they are more experienced
than we are. A real working-class newspaper, i.e., a newspaper that is
really financed by the workers and which pursues the Party line, is a
powerful instrument of organisation.  

What do these figures show? These objective figures show that
Pravda is a genuinely working-class newspaper, whereas the
liquidationist newspaper, which repudiates the “underground”, i. e., the
Party, both in its ideas and in the sources from which it obtains its funds
is, in fact, a bourgeois newspaper.  

From January 1 to May 13, 1914, both newspapers, as usual, published
reports of collections, and our newspaper published a summary of these
reports. Here are the results. Pravda collected R.21,584.11, of
which R.18,934.10 came from workers’ groups. Thus, 87 per cent of the
contributions came from organised workers and only 13 per cent from the
bourgeoisie.  

The liquidators collected R.12,055.89, of which R.5,296.12 came from
workers’ groups, i.e., only 44 per cent—less than half. The
liquidators get more than half their funds from bourgeois sources.


Moreover, day in day out the entire liberal-bourgeois press eulogises
the liquidators, helps then to flout the will

    

of the majority of the workers, and encourages them in their
reformism and repudiation of the “underground”.  

The activities of the groups abroad are exemplified in the newspaper
Yedinstvo, run by Comrade Plekhanov, deputy Buryanov, and
others. I have before me three issues of this newspaper, the first for
May 18 and the third for June 15 of this year. The reports in these issues
show that somebody contributed 1,000 rubles to the newspaper through
Comrade Olgin, who lives abroad, while collections made abroad amounted to
R.207.52. Six (six!) workers’ groups contributed 60 rubles.  

And this newspaper, which is supported by six workers’ groups in
Russia, calls upon the workers not to heed the Party’s decisions, and calls
it a “splitters’” Party! A Party which in the course of
two-and-a-half years rallied 5,600 groups of workers around the
definitely formulated decisions of the three illegal conferences
of 1912 and 1913 is a “splitters’” Party; whereas Plekhanov’s
group, which united six workers’ groups in Russia and collected 1,200
rubles abroad for the purpose of thwarting the will of the Russian
workers, is a group which stands for “unity”, if you please!  

Plekhanov accuses others of being factionalists, as though making
separate collections for a separate group, and calling upon the workers not
to carry out the decisions adopted by a four-fifths majority, is
not factionalism.  

As for us, we say plainly that we regard the behaviour of Plekhanov’s
group as a model of disruption. Plekhanov’s conduct is the same as
though Mehring, in Germany, were to organise six workers’ groups and, in an
independent newspaper, call upon the German Social-Democrats to defy the
party which had, let us assume, split away from the Poles.  

Plekhanov and we speak in different tongues. We call the solidarity of
four-fifths of the workers in Russia real unity, and not unity merely in
word; and we call disruption the struggle conducted by groups
abroad—financed with money collected abroad—against the majority of the
Russian workers.  

According to the figures Comrade Vandervelde obtained in St. Petersburg
and made public in the tress, Pravda has a circulation of 40,000,
while the liquidationist newspaper has one of 16,000. Pravda is
maintained by the workers and

    

pays its way, but the liquidationist newspaper is maintained by those whom
our newspaper calls their rich friends from among the bourgeoisie.


We are submitting to the Executive Committee of the International
Socialist Bureau the financial reports published in both newspapers. To
foreign comrades, who know what a serious business a working-class
newspaper is, this will be far more convincing than assurances, promises,
statements, and abuse of the Leninists.  

We ask the liquidators: do they still choose to ignore the
objective fact that their group’s newspaper is in effect
a bourgeois undertaking run for the purpose of advocating repudiation of
the “underground” and of flouting the will of the majority of
the class-conscious workers of Russia?  

If they do, then all their talk about “unity” will continue to evoke
derision from our workers.  

Those who earnestly seek unity should sincerely admit that the entire
liquidationist line is utterly fallacious, as has been proved by Party
decisions commencing with 1908, as well as by the experience of
the struggle waged by the masses of the workers during the past
two-and-a-half years.  

To proceed. Here are the objective figures concerning the election of
workers’ representatives to the insurance bodies. We reject as mere
liberalism all talk about political, constitutional reforms in present-day
tsarist Russia and will have nothing to do with it; but we take advantage
of real reforms, such as insurance, in deed and not in
word. The entire workers’ group on the All-Russia Insurance Board
consists of Pravda supporters, i.e., of workers who have condemned
and rejected liquidationism. During the election to this All-Russia
Insurance Board, 47 out of the 57 delegates, i. e., 82 per cent, were
Pravdists. During the election of the Metropolitan, St. Petersburg,
Insurance Board, 37 of the delegates were Pravdists and 7 were liquidators,
the Pravdists constituting 84 per cent.  

The same can be said about the trade unions. When they hear the talk of
the Russian Social-Democrats abroad about the “chaos of factional strife”
in Russia (indulged in by Rosa Luxemburg, Plekhanov, Trotsky, and others),
our foreign comrades perhaps imagine that the trade union movement in our
country is split up.  
 

Nothing of the kind.  

In Russia there are no duplicate unions. Both in St. Petersburg and in
Moscow, the trade unions are united. The point is that in these
unions the Pravdists completely predominate.  

Not one of the thirteen trade unions in Moscow is liquidationist.  

Of the twenty trade unions in St. Petersburg listed in our Workers’
Calendar together with their membership, only the Draftsmen’s, Druggist
Employees’ and Clerks’ Unions, and half the members of the Printers’ Union,
are liquidationist; in all the other unions—Metalworkers’, Textile
Workers’, Tailors’, Woodworkers’, Shop Assistants’, and so forth—the
Pravdists completely predominate.  

And we say plainly: if the liquidators do not want drastically to
change their tactics and put a stop to their disruptive struggle against
the organised majority of the class-conscious workers in Russia, let them
stop talking about “unity”.  

Every day Pravda commends the “underground”, if
only obliquely, and condemns those who repudiate it. And the workers follow
the lead of their Pravda.  

Here are figures on the illegal press published abroad. After
the liquidators’ August Conference in 1912, our Party, up to June 1914, put
out live issues of an illegal leading political newspaper; the
liquidators—nil; the
Socialist-Revolutionaries—nine. These figures do not include
leaflets issued in Russia for revolutionary agitation during strikes,
meetings and demonstrations.  

In these five issues you will find mention of 44 illegal organisations
of our Party; the liquidators—nil; the Socialist
Revolutionaries—21 (mainly students and peasants).  

Lastly, in October 1913, an independent Russian Social-Democratic
Labour group was formed in the Duma, the aim of that group, unlike that of
the liquidators, being to carry out, not flout, the will of the
majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia. At that time
both newspapers published resolutions from workers all
over Russia supporting either the line of the Party group or that of the
liquidationist group. The signatures to the resolutions in favour
of the Pravdist, i. e., the Party group in the Duma, numbered
6,722, whereas those supporting the liquidationist group numbered

    

2,985 (including 1,086 signatures of Bundist workers and 719 of
Caucasian workers). Thus, together with all their allies, the liquidators
succeeded in collecting less than one-third of the signatures.


These, briefly, are the objective data which we oppose to the bare
statements by the liquidators. These objective data on the mass
working-class movement in Russia during the past two-and-a-half years
definitely prove, through the experience of the class-conscious workers,
that our Party line is correct.  

Here I must digress and quote a concrete case to prove why “unity” or
even “peace” with the present newspaper of the present liquidators is
entirely ruled out.  

This is an extremely important case, which will explain the attitude of
the liquidators towards our Party’s illegal activities, and I therefore ask
the comrades to pay special attention to it.  

It is common knowledge that since 1912 the revolutionary mass strikes
have been developing with remarkable success in Russia. The factory owners
have tried to counter them with lockouts. To formulate the Party’s attitude
towards this form of struggle, a conference of our Party, held in February
1913 (note the date: 1913!) drew up and published a
resolution
illegally.[12] 

This resolution (page 11 of the illegal publication) definitely
advanced “the immediate task of organising revolutionary street
demonstrations”. It definitely recommended (ibid.) that “to counteract
lockouts, new forms of struggle should be devised, such as the go-slow
strike, for example, and, instead of political strikes, revolutionary,
meetings and revolutionary street demonstrations should be organised”,


This, we repeat, was in February 1913, i. e., six months after
the August Conference (1912) of the liquidators, the very same conference
which assured the whole world that the liquidators were not
opposed to the “underground”. Neither during those six months,
from August 1912 to February 1913, nor during the ensuing twelve
months, from February 1913 to February 1914, did the August bloc issue
a single resolution on this question. Absolutely none! Listen
further. 
 

On March 20, 1914, the St. Petersburg factory owners decided to
retaliate to a strike by declaring a lockout. In one day 70,000 workers in
St. Petersburg were dismissed.  

In conformity with our Party’s resolution, the St. Petersburg Committee
of the R.S.D.L.P., our Party’s illegal organisation in St. Petersburg,
decided to meet the lockout with a revolutionary demonstration on April 4,
the anniversary of the shootings in the Lena
gold-fields.[13] 

It illegally issued an appeal to the workers, a copy of which lies
before me now. It is signed: “The St. Petersburg Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P.”  It repeats the Party’s slogans (a republic and confiscation
of the land) and ends with the words: 

“Comrades! Come out onto the Nevsky Prospekt at 11 a.m. on April 4.”


Needless to say, Pravda itself, as a legal publication, could
not mention this appeal, let alone reprint it.  

What was to be done? How could it convey to its working-class readers,
if only to the most class-conscious and advanced of them, the idea
that it was necessary to support the illegal appeal for an illegal
revolutionary demonstration?  

The only thing was to resort to the method that we always resort to,
namely, hinting.  

And so, on the very day of the demonstration, on Friday, April 4,1914,
our paper (Put Pravdy No. 54) published an unsigned leading
article under the discreet heading: “Forms of the Working-Class
     Movement.”[1]

This article makes direct mention of the “formal decision adopted
by the Marxists in February 1913” and hints at a demonstration of
a revolutionary character in the following words: 

“The class-conscious workers are well acquainted with certain concrete
cases when the movement rose to higher forms [i. e., forms of the struggle]
which, historically, were subjected to repeated tests, and which are
‘unintelligible’ and ‘alien’ only to the liquidators.” (Put
Pravdy, 1914, No. 54.)  

The Russian police and public prosecutors missed the hint. But the
class-conscious workers did not.  
 

The demonstration took place. All the bourgeois evening newspapers of
April 4 were full of it. The next day, April 5, our paper (see Put
Pravdy No. 55) quoted excerpts from the bourgeois newspapers,
which stated that “during the last few days large numbers of leaflets
signed by the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. were distributed
among the workers, calling for a demonstration on April 4, the anniversary
of the events in the Lena gold-fields”.  

Our paper could not be prosecuted for publishing this passage
from the bourgeois newspapers. The result was that the decision of the
illegal Party was carried out. A revolutionary demonstration was organised,
and this work was backed by a legal newspaper with a readership of
40,000 workers.  

And what did the liquidators do?  

As I have already said, neither during the six months from
August 1912 to February 1913, nor during the whole of the ensuing
twelve months did a single illegal decision of the August bloc
appear.  

Nobody heard anything of illegal appeals by the liquidators (in
connection with April 4, 1914) in St. Petersburg, nor did the bourgeois
newspapers mention them. It must be said that evidence by the bourgeois
newspapers is very important, for when leaflets are distributed in
really large numbers, the bourgeois newspapers always hear and write about
it. On the other hand, if leaflets are distributed in insignificant
numbers, the masses are not aware of the fact, and the bourgeois newspapers
say nothing about it.  

Thus, the liquidators themselves did nothing to organise the
revolutionary demonstration on April 4, 1914. They held aloof.  

Moreover, in reporting the demonstration the next day, the legal
liquidationist newspaper 


did not reproduce the information given in the bourgeois newspapers
about the distribution of leaflets signed by the St. Petersburg Committee
of our Party!  

This is monstrous, but it is a fact. I attach here a copy of the
liquidationist newspaper of April 5, 1914 (Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta No. 48), in order to denounce this fact before the Executive
Committee of the International Socialist Bureau.  
 

Just think what this means! People who shout that they want “unity”
with our Party, people who claim to be Social-Democrats, conceal
from the workers the existence of the illegal organisation of our
Party, the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., conceal the fact
that the latter issued revolutionary, illegal, underground
leaflets, and that it organised the demonstration on April 4,
1914.  

People who shout about “unity” with our Party refrain from
reproducing information published in the bourgeois newspapers about
the mass distribution of underground leaflets signed by the
St. Petersburg Committee of our Party!  

This should help our comrades in the foreign parties to understand why
the question of the “underground” is of such vital and cardinal
importance to us.  

But even that is not all. A week later, on April 11, 1914, an article
appeared in the liquidationist newspaper (Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta No. 51) in which the author sneered at the article
published in Pravda of April 4, the day of the demonstration, on
the “higher forms” of the struggle, sneered at the fact that
Pravda had 

“clothed its ideas in a form that is difficult to
understand”!  

Just think: the legal liquidationist newspaper, which is constantly
criticising and abusing the “underground” sneers at the fact
that our legal newspaper, which desires to help the
“underground”, does this only in the form of hints!  

And for our newspaper’s hint at “higher forms”, i.e., at the
revolutionary, demonstration organised by the St. Petersburg Committee of
our Party, the liquidators publicly, in their newspaper, in that very same
article, called us “adventurists” and “most unprincipled
adventurists”, “anarcho-syndicalists” “acting as agents
provocateurs against the workers”!  

I have with me all the documents, a copy of the leaflet issued by the
St. Petersburg Committee, a copy of our newspaper; and a copy of the
liquidationist newspaper. Let those comrades who are interested request
that these documents be translated for them in full.  

On behalf of the Central Committee of our Party and of the vast
majority of the organised Social-Democratic workers

    

of Russia, I declare: there can be no “unity” and no “peace” with
this group of liquidators as long as a newspaper like this exists!


We cannot carry on our revolutionary activities among the
masses in “unity” with such a newspaper.  
III

I now come to the third part of my report. Having examined the
experience of the mass working-class movement in Russia, which has
confirmed the correctness of our line, I now propose to examine the
experience of our opponents.  

Our opponents, both the liquidators and groups abroad, such as
Plekhanov’s, like to apply to us the abusive term of “usurpers”. They
repeated this abuse in the columns of Vorw\"arts in
March 1912. But Vorw\"arts did not give us an opportunity of
replying! Let us see what political significance there is in the accusation
that we are “usurpers”.  

I have already said that the 1912 Conference was convened by the
Russian Organising Commission which was set up by the Party committees
after the liquidators had wrecked the old Central Committee. We take credit
for having re stored the illegal Party, and the majority of the workers of
Russia have recognised this.  

But let us assume for a moment that our numerous opponents (numerous in
the opinion of the intellectualist groups and the Party groups living
abroad) are right. Let us assume that we are “usurpers”, “splitters”,
and so forth. In that case, would it not be natural to expect our opponents
to prove, not merely with words, but by the experience of
their activities and their unity, that we are wrong.  

If we are wrong in asserting that the Party can only be built up by
fighting the liquidationist groups, then should we not expect the groups
and organisations which disagree with us to prove from the
experience of their activities that unity with the liquidators is
possible?  

But the experience of our opponents shows this. In January 1912, our
illegal Party was restored by our Conference, which was representative of
the majority of organisations in Russia.  
 

In March 1912, the following united in the columns of
Vorw\"arts to abuse us: 


the liquidators

    the Bund

    the Letts

    the Poles

    the Trotskyists

    and the Vperyodists.  


What a lot of “trends” and “groups”, one might think!  How easy it
should have been for them to set the workers of Russia a good example by
their unity!  

But when steps were taken to convene the “August” Conference of the
liquidators, it was found that our opponents could not march in
step.  

Both the Poles and Plekhanov refused to attend the “August”
Conference of the liquidators.  

Why? 

Because they could not agree even on the meaning of the term:
membership in the Party!  

And so, when Plekhanov’s group or Rosa Luxemburg or anybody else,
assure themselves and others that it is possible to unite with the
liquidators, we answer: dear comrades, you just try yourselves to “unite”
with the liquidators on a definition of Party membership, not in word,
but in deed.  

Further. The Vperyodists attended the August Conference, but afterwards
walked out in protest and denounced it as a fiction.  

Then, in February 1914, eighteen months after the “August Conference”
of the liquidators, the Congress of the Lettish Party was held. The Letts
had always been in favour of “unity”. The Lettish workers had
wanted to work with the liquidators and had proved this, not merely in
word, but in deed, by experience.  

And after eighteen months’ experience, the Letts, while remaining
strictly neutral, declared at their congress that they were
withdrawing from the August bloc because: 

—as the resolution of the Lettish Congress reads: 

“The attempt by the conciliators to unite at all costs with the
liquidators (the August Conference of 1912) proved

    

fruitless, and the uniters themselves became ideologically and politically
dependent upon the liquidators.”  

If anybody else wants to make the “experiment of uniting with the
liquidators”, let them do so. We, however, declare that until the
liquidators definitely abandon their liquidationist line, unity with them
is absolutely impossible.  

Lastly, Trotsky’s group, the Caucasians under their leader An, and a
number of other liquidators (“Em-El”, for example) have practically
dropped out of the August bloc and founded their own
journal, Borba. This journal has no connection with the workers
whatsoever, but by its very existence, by its criticism of the liquidators’
opportunism, by its breakaway from the liquidators, this journal, which
belongs to the group of former liquidators, has proved in deed and
by experience that unity with the liquidators is impossible.  

Unity will be possible only when the liquidators are ready, once and
for all, to abandon their entire tactics and cease to be liquidators.  

I shall now proceed to formulate the precise and formal conditions for
such “unity”.  
IV

The following are the practical, concrete conditions, formulated by our
Central Committee, which will make “unity” with the liquidators possible
for our Party.  

First: 

1.
The Party resolutions on liquidationism, adopted in December 1908 and
January 1910, shall be confirmed in the most emphatic and unreserved
fashion, in application precisely to liquidationism.  

In order that this confirmation may be accepted by all class-conscious
workers in Russia as something really serious and final, and in order that
no room may be left for any ambiguity, it shall be agreed that whoever
opposes (especially in the legal press) the “underground”, i. e., the
illegal organisation, calls it a “corpse”, declares it non existent, that
its restoration is a reactionary utopia, and so forth, or, in general,
deprecates the role and importance

    

of the “underground”, shall be deemed deserving of condemnation and shall
not be tolerated in the ranks of the illegal R.S.D.L.P.  

It shall be agreed that whoever opposes (especially in the legal press)
the “advertising of the illegal press” shall be deemed deserving of
condemnation and shall not be tolerated in the ranks of the illegal
Party. Membership in the illegal Party shall be open only to those who
sincerely devote all their efforts to promoting the development of the
illegal press, the publication of illegal leaflets, and so forth.


It shall be agreed that whoever, in any form whatsoever, advocates the
formation in present-day Russia of an “open” (i. e., legal) workers’
party—for objectively such a party would be a tsarist-monarchist labour
party—whoever proclaims the slogan of an “open party” or of
“fighting” for such a party, shall be deemed deserving of condemnation
and shall not be tolerated in the ranks of the illegal Party.  

It shall be agreed that whoever, in any form whatsoever, opposes
(especially in the legal press) revolutionary mass strikes (i. e., strikes
which combine the economic and political struggle with revolutionary
agitation) and opposes the organisation of revolutionary meetings and
street demonstrations, shall be deemed, deserving of condemnation and shall
not be tolerated in the ranks of the illegal Party. The banning of attacks
against the revolutionary activities of the Party, which conducts strikes
and demonstrations, shall also apply to condemnation, in the legal press,
of the “strike craze” among the workers, or of “higher forms of the
struggle” (=the legal pseudonym for demonstrations).  

It shall be agreed that the journal Nasha Zarya and the
newspaper Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta are guilty of such deviations
from the Social-Democratic line towards “bourgeois influence”.  

2.
It shall be agreed that whoever, in any form whatsoever, declares
(especially in the legal press) that the slogans of a democratic republic
and confiscation of the landed estates—slogans incorporated in our
Party’s programme and particularly urgent in present-day Russia, where the
tsarist monarchy has reduced the tsar’s formal recognition of the
constitution to sheer mockery of the people—are useless, or of little use
for agitation among the masses, shall, be

    

deemed deserving of condemnation and shall not be tolerated in the ranks of
the illegal Party.  

It shall be agreed that whereas the liberal press is broad casting the
idea of reformism, the idea that political freedom is compatible with the
existence of the tsarist monarchy, and that the revolutionary overthrow of
tsarism is unnecessary, harmful, and sinful—in view of this, agitation
for a constitutional reform such as freedom of association must be
conducted, and conducted on the widest possible scale, with a clear
realisation, however, that the working class is hostile to the propaganda
of the liberal reformists; and this agitation must be closely combined with
the task of explaining and disseminating the slogan of a republic, as a
slogan for the revolutionary onslaught of the masses against the tsarist
monarchy.  

3.
It shall be agreed that it is absolutely impermissible and incompatible
with membership in the Party for any section of our Party—the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party—to enter into a bloc or alliance with
any other party.  

It shall be agreed that the bloc of the Bund and the liquidators with
the Left-wing of the P.S.P., a non-Social-Democratic party,
against the will and without the consent of the Polish
Social-Democrats, and without a decision by the Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
comes within the category of such prohibited blocs.  

Deputy Jagiello, as a member of a non-Social-Democratic party, can be
regarded only as being aligned with our Party group in the Duma, but not as
a member of that group.  

4.
It shall be agreed that in every city and every locality there shall be
only one united Social-Democratic organisation embracing workers of all
nationalities, and conducting activities in all the languages spoken by the
local proletariat.  

The national-Jewish separatism of the Bund, which to this day, in spite
of the decisions of the Stockholm Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. of 1906, which
were reaffirmed by the Conference of December 1908, refuses to apply the
principle of international unity among the Social-Democratic workers in the
localities—a principle which has been applied with such outstanding
success in the Caucasus since
1898[14]—shall be condemned.  
 

5.
It shall be agreed that the demand for “cultural-national autonomy”,
which divides the workers according to nationality and is a refined form of
nationalism—a demand that was rejected by a formal decision of the Second
(1903) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.—contradicts the programme of the Party
(as does also that pseudonym for cultural-national autonomy called “the
establishment of institutions which will guarantee free national
development”).  

All decisions by all local, national or special organisations of our
Party (including the group in the Duma) that accept the principle of
cultural-national autonomy shall be an nulled and their re-adoption without
a decision of the Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. shall be considered
incompatible with membership in the Party.  

6.
Social-Democratic workers of every shade of opinion shall forthwith be
called upon by all Party organisations, and by all the Party’s publications
in all languages, immediately to bring about unity from below,
i. e., to form local, illegal Social-Democratic units, organisations and
centres, or to join such organisations where they already exist. In this
connection, the principle of federation, or of equality for all “trends”
shall be unreservedly rejected, and the only principle to be recognised
shall be that of loyal submission of the minority to the majority. The
number of financial contributions made by workers’ groups to the newspapers
of the various trends since 1913, as reported in the legal press, shall be
taken as the most accurate though approximate index of the alignment of
forces among the various trends in the working-class
movement. Consequently, these figures shall be published in all Party
publications, which shall advise all Social-Democrats in the localities to
be guided by these figures in all practical steps they take, pending the
next Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.  

In the matter of defining Party membership, the sole criterion
shall be membership in an illegal unit, group, or other organisation
(local, factory, district organisation, or Social-Democratic group in some
legal society), illegal activities in organising meetings, discussing Party
decisions and distributing illegal literature.  

All groups and “trends” shall immediately issue absolutely clear and
definite illegal announcements about this.  
 

7.
The existence of two rival newspapers in the same town or locality shall be
absolutely forbidden. The minority shall have the right to discuss before
the whole Party, disagreements on programme, tactics and organisation in a
discussion journal specially published for the purpose, but shall not have
the right to publish, in a rival newspaper, pronouncements disruptive of
the actions and decisions of the majority.  

Inasmuch as the liquidators’ newspaper in St. Petersburg, which is
supported chiefly by bourgeois, not proletarian funds, is published
contrary to the will of the acknowledged and

     indisputable[2]

majority of the class-conscious Social-Democratic workers in
St. Petersburg, and causes extreme disorganisation by advocating disregard
for the will of the majority, it shall be deemed necessary to close this
newspaper immediately and to issue a discussion journal in its place.  

8.
The resolution of the Second Congress of 1903, as well as that of the
London Congress of 1907, on the bourgeois-democratic character of the
Narodnik trend in general, including the Socialist-Revolutionary Party,
shall be most definitely and unreservedly confirmed.  

Any blocs, alliances, or temporary agreements between any one section
of the Social-Democrats and the Socialist-Revolutionaries (or Narodniks in
general) against another section of the Social-Democrats, shall be
absolutely prohibited.  

The St. Petersburg liquidators, who even at their own “August
Conference” proclaimed no new Social-Democratic line towards the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, and have been entering into blocs and agreements
with the Socialist-

    

Revolutionaries against the overwhelming majority of the Social-Democratic
workers in St. Petersburg, as was the case during the elections to the
Insurance Boards, shall he definitely and unreservedly condemned.  

A publicists’ bloc shall be forbidden between outstanding liquidators
and prominent Social-Democrats belonging to groups that defend the
liquidators (Plekhanov, Trotsky, and others), and the
Socialist-Revolutionaries who in their St. Petersburg journal
Sovremennik assert that “the old cleavage, at all events, has
disappeared” and that “it is impossible to tell where Marxism ends and
Narodism begins”. (Sovremennik No. 7, p. 76.)  

Publicists who wish to become members of the Social Democratic Party,
but who contribute to that journal for reasons other than the necessity of
seeking a livelihood by writing for bourgeois publications, shall be called
upon to withdraw from the journal and make a public announcement to this
effect.  

9.
In view of the extreme disorganisation introduced into the working-class
movement of Russia by various detached groups abroad, which act without a
mandate from any Party organisation in Russia, and without any agreement
with such an organisation, it shall be deemed necessary to pass and put
into effect a resolution that all groups resident abroad shall without
exception communicate with organisations operating in Russia only through
the Central Committee of the Party.  

Groups abroad which do not submit to the Russian centre of
Social-Democratic activity, i. e., the Central Committee, and which cause
disorganisation by communicating with Russia independently of the Central
Committee, shall have no right to speak on behalf of the R.S.D.L.P.  

A Social-Democratic discussion journal shall be founded abroad, with
funds collected there, for the purpose of discussing from all angles and
free of the censorship, questions concerning the programme, tactics and
organisation.  

The Party rule (Clause 3) that only “endorsed organisations of the
Party have a right to publish Party literature” shall be reaffirmed and
strictly applied.  

10.
The resolution unanimously adopted at the beginning of January 1908 by the
London Central Committee

    

shall be deemed absolutely binding on all Social-Democrats.  

The resolution reads: 

“more vigorous Social-Democratic activity in the trade union movement
is prescribed by the entire present situation and must be carried on in
keeping with the spirit of the

London[3]

and

      Stuttgart[4]

resolutions, i. e., under no circumstances in the spirit of recognising the
principle that trade unions are neutral or non-Party, but on the contrary,
in the spirit of unswerving effort to establish the closest possible
connection between the trade unions and the Social-Democratic Party.”


It shall be agreed that attempts to conduct agitation in the trade
unions against the illegal R.S.D.L.P. are incompatible with membership in
the Party.  

The liquidators shall undertake to refrain from calling for
insubordination to the executives of the unions, to loyally submit to the
Marxist majority of the unions, and under no circumstances form separatist
duplicate unions.  

The same shall apply to activities in all kinds of workers’
societies—clubs and the like.  

All Social-Democrats in every union, cultural and educational
society and the like, shall join the illegal Social-Democratic unit in the
respective organisation. The decisions of the illegal Party shall be
binding on all such groups.  

It shall be agreed that it is obligatory for all Social-Democrats to
oppose the division of the trade unions according to nationality.


11.
It shall be agreed that newspaper utterances against the representation
elected by the St. Petersburg workers to the insurance bodies (the
All-Russia Insurance Board, the Metropolitan Insurance Board, and so forth)
and appeals for non-subordination to its direction, etc., must be
forbidden. It shall be agreed that the insurance programme approved by
this workers’ representation is obligatory.  

The journal Strakhovanie
Rabochikh,[15] which is a rival to the official organ of the
workers’ insurance representation (Voprosy Strakhovania) shall
close down.  
 

12.
The Caucasian Social-Democrats must forbid agitation in favour of
cultural-national autonomy, which has been rejected by the Programme of the
R.S.D.L.P.  

The Caucasian Social-Democrats shall undertake not to violate the
principle of a united international organisation in every city, and under
no circumstances adopt the principle, either in political or industrial
organisations, of dividing workers according to nationality.  

13.
The six members of the Duma (the Chkheidze group), and also deputy
Buryanov, must accept all the above conditions.  

The Chkheidze group must declare from the Duma rostrum that, in
conformity with the Programme of the Russian Social-Democrats, it
withdraws its support of “cultural national autonomy” (and its
pseudonym: “institutions” etc.).  

The Chkheidze group must accept the leadership of the Party’s Central
Committee elected at the January Conference of 1912, and must recognise as
binding all Party decisions, and also the Central Committee’s right of
veto.  


Such are the terms on which the Central Committee of our Party
considers unity possible, and on which it under takes to launch a campaign
in favour of unity. We consider it utterly impossible to have any
negotiations or contacts with the liquidators’ group which publishes
Nasha Zarya and Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, as long as it
pursues its present tactics. As far as their political role in the
working-class movement in Russia is concerned, we regard all the other
groups, trends, factions and bodies which defend the liquidators or
advocate unity or compromise with them, as fictions.  

We declare that to feed the working class of Russia with verbal
assurances and promises that unity with the liquidationist group is
possible and easy, means rendering very bad service to the cause, and
passing off phrases for reality.  

We therefore make the following practical proposal.  

A year ago, the question was raised in our Party of convening a Party
congress. This was announced in the resolutions of the 1913 Summer
Conference of the Central Committee

    

of the R.S.D.L.P. The arrangements for convening this congress are now
almost completed. In all probability, a congress of our Party will be held
in the very near future, immediately after the Vienna Congress, or even
while it is being held. Of course, we ask the comrades not to announce this
or speak of it. If arrests are very numerous, perhaps a conference will be
held instead of a congress.  

Thus, while refraining from any steps towards a rapprochement with the
liquidationist group or its defenders until the above terms are
accepted and carried out, we propose that all groups, trends and
factions, which—unlike us—hold that unity, or peace, or compromise with
the present liquidationist group such as it is, is possible considering its
present tactics, we propose that these groups should take the opportunity
provided by the Vienna Congress to organise a joint formal discussion of
our terms.  

Let those who advocate peace or compromise with the liquidators not
confine themselves to propaganda, but prove in deed that unity
with the present liquidators is possible.  

For our part, We shall be very glad if we are able to inform the
representatives of four-fifths of the workers of Russia gathered at the
congress or conference of our Party as to the outcome of the conference
between all groups that defend the liquidators, and the liquidationist
group.  

14.
In conclusion, I must touch upon one other point which, although very
unpleasant, cannot be avoided if we are to have a sincere and frank
exchange of opinion on the question of Social-Democratic unity in Russia.


The point is the following: 

In their press, our opponents, the liquidators, are conducting a bitter
personal campaign against several members of our Party, accusing them
publicly and before the masses, of a host of dishonourable, despicable and
criminal actions, or else reporting in their newspaper “rumours” about
such actions. Our Party press replies to these attacks and, in the name of
the Central Committee of our Party, plainly and definitely calls the
liquidators—and especially their two leaders, Dan and
Martov—slanderers.  

It is not difficult to realise the degree of disorganisation and
demoralisation the liquidators are spreading among the masses by this sort
of “campaign”, to which we shall always

    

retaliate on the principle “à corsaire—corsaire et
demi”. We shall briefly quote four examples: 

1.
In 1911, L. Martov published in Paris a pamphlet entitled Saviours or
Destroyers, devoted in the main to accusations against Lenin of having
committed dishonourable and criminal acts; Martov sent a German translation
of this pamphlet to Kautsky, who was then acting as arbiter in a
controversial question affecting Russian Social-Democracy. In a letter to
Lunacharsky (of the Vperyod group) Kautsky described Martov’s
pamphlet as “disgusting”, and this opinion was published in the Russian
Social-Democratic press by Plekhanov. The liquidators’ newspaper is now
beginning, in the form of insinuations, gradually to spread the contents of
this pamphlet among the Russian public.  

2.
Since 1913 the liquidators’ newspaper has been constantly accusing Dansky,
a member of our Party and an insurance expert, of dishonesty. The pretext
for these accusations is that Dansky works for an employers’ organisation,
thus serving the bourgeoisie. Our Party, as represented by a number of
bodies (the editorial boards of Pravda and
Prosveshcheniye, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the
Duma, several trade unions, etc.), examined these accusations and found
that Dansky had gradually given up working for the employers and was
serving the working-class movement, beginning as anonymous contributor to
Pravda. When Dansky definitely joined our Party he was requested,
in conformity with the resolutions of our Party, to sever all connections
with the employers’ organisation. Dansky did so and gave up his job. On
behalf of the Central Committee, I repeat that our Party regards this man
as an honest comrade, and it will not permit anybody to besmirch his honour
with impunity. Our press, in accusing the liquidators of slandering Dansky,
pointed out that in this case the liquidators were particularly dishonest,
because Martov himself constantly writes for a bourgeois newspaper under a
different pseudonym (here I will fully reveal the fact:
Yegorov, in Kievskaya Mysl); Yezhov, one of the
closest collaborators of the liquidationist newspaper, was on the staff of
an employers’ association, as was, or is, also the case with
Yermansky.  
 

3.
Malinovsky, a Duma member, suddenly left the Duma and resigned without
giving any reason. Our workers called together their local and central
leading bodies and sentenced Malinovsky to expulsion from the Party,
describing his unexplained resignation without consultation with his
colleagues as disruptive, and as desertion from his post. The
liquidationist newspaper then began to publish anonymous rumours to the
effect that Malinovsky was an agent provocateur, and demanded a joint
investigation by the different groups. Our Central Committee declared that
it vouched for Malinovsky, had investigated the rumours, and was convinced
that Dan and Martov were indulging in base slander. The Central Committee
rejected the proposal for a joint commission with the liquidators and,
following on the opinion expressed by the representatives of ten trade
unions in Moscow, denounced as slanderers those people who dared to publish
in the press anonymous “rumours” about agents provocateurs,
instead of submitting these rumours in an organised manner to our Central
Committee, or to their own Central Committee (their “O. C.”), to
the Bund and to groups that trust the liquidators, to have them
investigated by boards and responsible bodies. Burtsev declared
that he did not believe the rumours. The Committee of Investigation set up
by our Central Committee declared that it would publish the facts about
those who were circulating these rumours. I can only add that these rumours
were circulated by the liquidators.  

4.
Some days ago the liquidationist newspaper published an open letter from
ex-member of the Second Duma Alexinsky, accusing Comrade Antonov, a member
of our Party who had served a term of penal servitude, of being a
traitor. But Comrade Antonov’s conduct was pronounced unimpeachable both by
a special committee consisting of comrades who had served sentence with
him, as well as by a decision of the Central Committee of the Party adopted
in 1907–08 in Finland, when the Mensheviks (i.e., the present liquidators)
and all the “national organisations” were represented on the Central
Committee. The answer given in our press is again tantamount to accusing
Dan and Martov of spreading slander.  

On instructions from the Central Committee, I must submit to the
Executive Committee of the International Socialist

    

Bureau the following practical proposal on this matter. We regard the
liquidators’ procedure as a specific method of political struggle used by
people who have been expelled from the Party. We therefore harbour no hope
that this matter can be “rectified” with the aid of moral precepts. But
when bodies which screen the liquidators (the “0. C.” and the Bund, for
example, as well as Trotsky), and the numerous groups abroad (including
Plekhanov) talk to us about “unity” with these liquidators, we
make them the following proposal before the Executive Committee of the
International Socialist Bureau: 

let them declare openly and publicly, without
equivocation, whether they approve or disapprove of the liquidators’
“campaign” on all the four points enumerated (to which we are sure the
liquidators will add another 44).  

If they disapprove, let the workers of Russia know it.  

If they approve, let all groups that offer us “unity” or
compromise with the liquidators elect a joint commission and formulate a
reasoned, business-like, and open charge of dishonest conduct against
certain members of our Party. We shall submit this charge to our Party
congress and invite representatives of this commission of all groups which
defend the liquidators to attend our congress and produce their evidence.


We deem it our duty to declare that if this is not done, it will
strengthen the opinion, already being expressed in the ranks of our Party,
that all groups that advocate “unity” with the liquidators are
tacitly supporting the slanderers.  

In the name of the majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia,
we shall defend the organisation of our Party from the disruptors, and we
shall recognise no means of defence other than those we have applied, and
which I have enumerated above (not to mention the bourgeois law court, to
which we shall resort at the first opportunity).  

The report I have been instructed to make on behalf of the Central
Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is finished. Permit
me to sum up in two brief theses: 

Formally, the situation is as follows. Our Party, which was restored at
the January 1912 Conference in the teeth of the resistance from the
liquidators’ group, expelled that group.

    

After this, after two-and-a-half years of the movement, the
overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia have
approved of our Party line. We therefore have every reason to be convinced
more firmly than ever that our line is correct, and we shall not depart
from it. If the liquidators and the groups defending them want us to
rescind the resolution expelling the liquidators from the Party, our
Central Committee is prepared to submit a motion to that effect to our
Party congress and to support it only on the terms I have
mentioned.  

Materially, i. e., in substance, the position is as follows. Russia is
passing through a period of bourgeois revolutions, during which small and
unstable groups of intellectuals are sometimes inclined to regard
themselves as Social-Democrats, or to support the opportunist trend in the
Social-Democratic movement, which our Party has been fighting against for
the past twenty years (Economism in 1895–1902, Menshevism in 1903–08, and
liquidationism in 1908–14). The experience of the August (1912) bloc of
liquidators and its break-down have shown that the liquidators and their
defenders are absolutely incapable of forming any kind of party or
organisation. The genuine workers’ Social-Democratic Party of Russia which,
in spite of enormous difficulties, has already united eight-tenths of the
class conscious workers (counting only Social-Democrats) or seven-tenths
(counting Social-Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries) can be built up,
and is being built up, only in the struggle against these groups.  

    

Appendix
INSTRUCTIONS
I. NOTES PRIVÉES

On the question as to the connection existing between the figures on
whether the majority or the minority of workers follow the lead of the
Pravdists, or rather, are themselves Pravdists, in Russia, and the question
of “unity”, it should be noted: 

1.
If a party or group definitely and concretely advances a programme or
tactics with which our Party cannot agree in principle, then the question
of a majority is of course of no significance. If, for example, the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party (Left Narodniks), whose programme and tactics
differ from ours, were to win over the majority of workers in Russia, that
would not in the least induce us to depart from our line. The same applies
to the straightforward and definite repudiation of the “underground”
(=illegal Party) in present-day Russia.  

However, certain Social-Democratic groups and some liquidators assert
that there are no irreconcilable disagreements on principle between us. We
are obliged to point out their inconsistency to these groups and
individuals, when they refuse to submit to the majority.  

2.
We have been convinced of the correctness of our line on tactics and
organisation primarily by our long years of acquaintance with the workers’
Social-Democratic movement in Russia, and by our participation in it, as
well as by our theoretical Marxist convictions. But we are of the opinion
that the practical experience of the mass working-class movement
is no less important than theory, and that this experience alone can serve
as a serious test of our principles. “Theory, my friend, is grey,
but the tree of life is eternally green” (Faust). Therefore, the fact
that, after two-and-a-half

    

years of struggle against liquidationism and its allies, four-fifths of the
class-conscious workers have expressed them selves in favour of Pravdism,
strengthens our conviction that our line is correct and makes this
conviction unshakable.  

3.
In Russia, nearly every group, or “faction” (to use the old terminology),
accuses the other of being not a workers’ group, but a bourgeois
intellectualist group. We consider this accusation or rather argument, this
reference to the social significance of a particular group, extremely
important in principle. But precisely because we consider it extremely
important, we deem it our duty not to make sweeping statements about the
social significance of other groups, but to back our statements
with objective facts. For the objective facts prove absolutely and
irrefutably that Pravdism alone is a workers’ trend in
Russia, whereas liquidationism and Socialist-Revolutionism are in
fact bourgeois intellectualist trends.  
II. NOTES PRIVÉES

Should an attempt be made (whether by any member of the International
Socialist Bureau, or by our opponents) to “dismiss” or set aside
the evidence, the objective proofs, that we are the majority, then be sure
to ask for the floor so as to make a formal statement on behalf of the
entire delegation and enter a formal protest of the following nature: 

We categorically protest against the statement (or hints, inferences,
etc.) that our objective evidence as to the side which the overwhelming
majority of the class-conscious workers of Russia are supporting, cannot be
examined by the Executive Committee on the grounds that it has not verified
them (or on the grounds that they are irrelevant to the question of
unity). On the contrary, we consider that it is in the indubitable interest
of the entire International, and in accordance with the will of the
International Socialist Bureau, as clearly expressed in the resolution of
the I.S.B. (December 1913), to receive the fullest, most precise, and
documented information on the actual state of the working-class movement in
Russia.  
 

We are of the opinion that our opponents, who are aware of the December
decision of the I.S.B., have failed to per form their duty in not yet
having independently collected objective data on the working-class movement
in Russia.  

We declare that after Comrade Vandervelde’s successful visit to Russia,
there cannot be the slightest doubt that the Executive Committee of the
I.S.B. could, through Comrade Vandervelde, quite legally have addressed an
open letter to the editors of all the working-class (or would-be
working-class) newspapers in Russia, and to all the members of the
executives of all the legal workers’ societies in Russia, for the purpose
of obtaining from direct sources data showing how the class-conscious
workers of Russia are divided into Pravdists, liquidators,
Socialist-Revolutionaries (Left Narodniks), and other trends.  

Without such objective data, the subjective statements of the
representatives of individual “groups” are entirely worthless.  
III.  THE REPORT

Judging from certain fragmentary statements by the liquidators at the
Lettish Congress and from hints in the press, one of the fraudulent plans
for “unity” they propose is that of a “general congress”.  

This plan, whose obvious object is to dupe credulous foreigners, is
roughly as follows: either set up a “federated” organising committee for
the purpose of convening a general congress, or “supplement” the Central
Committee of our Party with representatives of one of the liquidationist
organisations for the purpose of convening this congress.  

In whatever the form it is presented, this plan is wholly unacceptable
to us, and if it nevertheless comes up at the “conference” in Brussels,
our delegation of the Central Committee must declare the following: 

It is absolutely impossible for us to take any step towards a general
congress or federation, or even towards the slightest rapprochement, until
the liquidators’ group complies with the terms we propose. For
unless that group fulfils these terms, it will be impossible for
us to place the slightest confidence in the liquidators’ group
which has been expelled

    

from the Party, and, in its paper, is daily continuing its disruptive
activities.  

If we placed any confidence in this group, it would encourage
it to continue its disruptive work: On the basis of decisions of our
congresses, conferences and our Central Committee, we demand the
cessation of these activities of the liquidators as a conditio
sine qua non of “peace”.  

The fact that the liquidators are shielded by groups or organisations
which have not been formally expelled from the Party (for example, the
Bund, or the Caucasian Regional Bureau, or the six deputies, etc.) does not
in the least alter the case. As far as work in Russia is concerned,
only one thing really matters, i. e., that this group of
liquidators and their newspaper advocate flouting the will of the majority.


Let the Bund, Chkheidze’s six deputies and the others—or the
Caucasian Regional Committee, or Trotsky, or the O.C., or anybody else who
desires rapprochement with us, first of all induce the
liquidators’ group to accept our terms, or else emphatically condemn it and
break with it. Unless this is done, we cannot take the slightest
step that might in any way indicate confidence in the liquidators’ group.


Let those who really want to see Russian Social-Democracy united
harbour no illusions and yield to no subjective assurances, promises and
the like. There is one and only one way to unity, and that is to induce the
minority which has left the illegal Party and is trying to thwart and
disrupt its activities and the will of the majority, to abandon its present
practices and prove in deed that it is willing to respect the will
of the majority.  

No direct or indirect encouragement of the liquidators’ group in its
present conduct, or attempts to inspire it with hopes of the
possibility of “federation”, “conciliation”, a “general congress”,
“rapprochement”, or the like with that group, as long as it
continues its present activities and refuses to submit in deed to
the will of the majority, will lead to anything. The Party of the
Social-Democratic workers in Russia, which unites four-fifths of the
class-conscious workers, will not allow its will to be thwarted.


Let those groups or bodies which “assure” themselves and others that
the liquidators are not so bad (the Bund,

    

the O.C., the Caucasian Regional Committee) realise that we want not words
but deeds. If they trust the liquidators, let them organise
their own congress with them, submit our terms to that
congress, and induce the liquidators to give a favourable reply to these
terms and faithfully carry them out. We shall wait and see the results; we
shall wait and see their actions; we shall not believe promises.


Only after our terms have been faithfully complied with will a general
congress, and steps towards it, be possible.  

Our foreign socialist comrades are sometimes most sadly mistaken when
they think that the cause of unity can be promoted by inspiring the
liquidators with the hope that we will agree to co-operate with them even
if they do not completely and radically change their conduct, and
even if they do not submit to the will of the
majority. Objectively, such tactics amount to helping, not the cause of
unity, but the splitters.  

Our terms constitute a draft of a pacte d’unité, and
until this pact is signed by the liquidators and until they have carried it
out in practice, there can be no talk of taking any steps towards a
rapprochement.  
IV

Re the demonstration of 4.4.
1914.[5]

1) I have ordered from St. Petersburg (in Popov’s name) issue No. 18 of
Stoikaya Mysl (Socialist-Revolutionary) and bourgeois papers for
4--5.4.1914. If it arrives it should be used to supplement the documents of
the report.  

We do not assert that the liquidators never issued
leaflets. They had one in May 1913 (the Vienna leaflet); in 1914,
the St. Petersburg people say, they had none. They are said to
have had one about the strike.  

But 4.4. 1914 is a typical case of the wrecking of illegal work.  


If Plekhanov or Rubanovich wish to ask publicly whether we vote
for their attendance, I would reply: “We would vote
against, because Rubanovich is not a Social-Democrat, and
Plekhanov does not represent anything in Russia. But
    

since our report contains a direct attack on Plekhanov’s group and
Rubanovich’s trend, we do not wish to vote against, and shall
abstain.  


Guarantees for the minority?—we may be asked.  

“No, we can discuss no guarantees whatever either with the group of
liquidators expelled from the Party, or concerning that group. We ourselves
demand guarantees from the liquidators and their friends.”  


N.B. The general spirit of our terms: fight against departures from the
old, against a swing towards a new party. Nous ne
marchons pas!  Cf. Axelrod on “party reform, or rather on a party
=

  revolution”.[6]


N.B.
|||
A person who writes like this is ridiculous, if he complains about a split!



Is an “All-Russia S.D.L.P.” legitimate without the
non-Russian nationalities?  

It is, because it was an All-Russia party from 1898 to 1903
without the Poles and Letts, and from 1903 to 1906 without the Poles, Letts
and the Bund!  

We did not exclude the non-Russian nationalities. They themselves left
on account of the liquidators. Tant pis pour eux!  


Fight with all our might to have the Conference Minutes
published. Submit a written protest in the event of refusal (in
case of a general refusal, demand that our resolutions be published—we
shall publish them in any case—as well as
counter-resolutions (the Executive Committee may eliminate
personal attacks)).  


We have one aim—to make the liquidators+Bund+P.S.P.+Plekhanov
formulate counter-resolutions and counter-proposals. As for us, we
agree to nothing, and walk out,

    

promising to submit the “counter-proposals” of our dear
comrades to our congress.  


The most important thing is to emphasise (best of all in a reply) that
our “terms” were in the main published long ago by the
workers. I am sending Popov the appropriate issues of Pravda.



What procedure is desirable, from our point of view, for the conference
in Brussels?  

First, ,the reports of all organisations and groups—this
will take up a fairly long time. Then brief comments followed by a
formulation of concrete proposals made by all
organisations and groups.  

When all the participants at the conference have formulated their
concrete proposals, each of them should express his opinion whether he
considers these proposals a basis for possible further
steps towards a rapprochement or talks on rapprochement, or, if he
considers that impossible, he will submit all the proposals to his
organisation.  

Clearly, we, in any case, shall not accept the proposals of
the liquidators, the Bund, Rosa and Plekhanov (as well as of Kautsky and
Vandervelde), and shall submit them to our congress or conference.  

Our task is only to make our terms clear, make a note of
“their” terms, and walk out.  

Are not our terms in the nature of an ultimatum?—we may be
asked. They are not. We shall see what counter proposals are made to us
before saying whether we agree to continued talks on this basis or not (we
should let everyone have his say, ask everyone for
counter-proposals on all questions, and go away. Voilà
notre programme!  

Should Polish affairs be kept apart from Russian? I think we ought to
be opposed to separation. We shall consult our Polish comrade on this.


Obviously, people will go out of their way to attack us for our
“monstrous” demands. We should calmly refer to the resolutions of our
conferences and meetings and the resolutions on unity adopted by the
St. Petersburg, Moscow,

    

Caucasian and other comrades. I shall send a collection of them. We sum
up the opinions of our organisations. If any body chooses to disregard
them, that is their business. Nous n’y pouvons rien.  

According to the liquidators’ newspaper, Vandervelde threw out a feeler
in St. Petersburg as to whether we would agree to the Executive Committee
acting, not as mediator but as arbiter, that is, as
supreme “judge” in our disagreements.  

The answer is this. When Bebel proposed this in 1905 our congress
rejected it with thanks, declaring that we were an autonomous
party.[16] I think today our congress will give the same reply. (Such,
at any rate, is the opinion of the Central Committee.)  

On “slanderous” affairs “they” will probably propose a general
withdrawal of all accusations. Ask this to be put to the vote!  We
are against. We shall submit their proposal to our congress. (They
will be in a proper mess if they make and carry through such a proposal.)
[[We do not equate the guilt of a spreader of slander with the conduct of a
person who has called a slanderer a slanderer.]]  

Generally speaking, there is no doubt that “they” will all seek
“half-way” and “conciliatory” formulas. We shall point out that this
attempt was made with regard to us in January 1910 and with regard to the
Letts in August 1912, and we shall not repeat it. Let the
conference divide into two clear camps: those who consider rapprochement
with the present liquidators possible, and those who turn down the
idea of rapprochement unless the liquidators radically change their
tactics and behaviour.  

“Conciliatory” formulas should be carefully recorded (this
is most important), then slightly criticised, and——everything rejected.

In their newspaper (Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta No. 34, for
June 13, 1914) the liquidators estimate the relative proportion of
Pravdists and liquidators in St. Petersburg at 72 per cent and 28 per cent
respectively. This queer calculation is based, not on the number of
workers’ groups, but on the sum of money collected from both workers and
bourgeois, so that 10,000 workers who contribute 10 kopeks each are
equivalent to one bourgeois who has contributed 1,000 rubles. In fact,
between January 1 and May 13, 1914, the Pravdists received 2,024
contributions from workers’ groups in St. Petersburg, while the liquidators
received 308, making the percentages 86 and 14 respectively.  —Lenin

[7]
Report of the C. C. of the R. S. D. L. P. exists in the shape
of two (incomplete) manuscripts, one of them Lenin’s, the other a
handwritten copy made by N. K. Krupskaya’s mother, Y. V. Krupskaya, with
corrections by Lenin. Other existing manuscripts are Lenin’s instructions
to the C. C. delegation to the conference, namely, “Notes
Privies”, notes “Not for the Report” and letters on this
question. These documents illustrate Lenin’s struggle against Russian and
international opportunism. The Report marks an epoch in the development of
Bolshevism in the period of reaction and the years of a new revolutionary
upswing.  

Concerned about the victory of the Bolsheviks over all the opportunist
trends and groups in the Russian working-class movement, the leadership of
the Second International hastened to the assistance of these trends and
groups. With this aim in view the Brussels Conference was convened,
ostensibly “to exchange opinions” on the question of the possibility of
restoring unity in the

   

R.S.D.L.P. Under the guise of establishing “peace” within the R.S.D.L.P.,
the leaders of the International planned the liquidation of the independent
Bolshevik Party, a party of a new type, which was conducting an
irreconcilable struggle against opportunism in the Russian and
international labour movement.  

The Brussels “Unity” Conference, convened
by the Executive Committee of the I.S.B. in accordance with the
December 1913 decision of the Bureau’s meeting, was held on July 16–18,
1914. The following were represented at the Conference: the Central
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks); the Organising Committee
(Mensheviks) and its affiliated organisations (the Caucasian Regional
Committee and the Borba group (Trotskyists)); the Duma
Social-Democratic group (Mensheviks); Plekhanov’s Yedinstvo group;
the Vperyod group; the Bund; the Social-Democrats of the Lettish
Region; the Social-Democrats of Lithuania; the Polish Social-Democrats; the
Polish Social-Democratic opposition; and the P.S.P. (Left wing).  

The C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. sent a delegation to the Conference,
consisting of Inessa Armand (Petrova), M. F. Vladimirsky (Kamsky), and
I. F. Popov (Pavlov). Lenin thoroughly prepared the delegation of the
C.C. for the Conference. He wrote for it the Report and detailed
instructions, and supplied it with the necessary materials, documents and
factual data revealing the Russian opportunists and their inspirers in
their true colours.  

Lenin was in the closest touch with the delegation, whose work he
directed from Poronin.  

From the very outset the Conference was marked by a very sharp struggle
of the Bolsheviks against the Russian and inter national opportunists.


At Kautsky’s proposal the Conference adopted the following agenda: =

1. Programmatic differences; =

2. Tactical differences; =

3. The organisational question. Although the Conference was to have been
confined only to an exchange of opinions, Vandervelde warned the delegates
that the Conference would adopt decisions on all three items of the
agenda. On Lenin’s instructions the C. C.’s delegation proposed that the
Conference should hear reports by the delegations and the concrete terms
which each of them considered essential for unity. Because of the
Bolsheviks’ persistence it was decided to waive the agenda and proceed to
the reports on the questions at issue, and to the formulation by the
delegations of concrete conditions for unity.  

The highlight of the Conference was the Report of the C. C. of the
R.S.D.L.P., as written by Lenin, Which was read by Inessa Armand in French
at the morning session on July 17. The leaders of the I.S.B. did not allow
the full text of the Report to be read so that Armand was obliged to set
forth only part of it and proceed to the terms for unity. As formulated by
Lenin these terms met with indignant protests from the opportunists,
Plekhanov declaring that these were not terms for unity, “but articles of
a new criminal code”. Martov, Alexinsky, Yonov, Semkovsky and others
shouted that the report of the C. C. characterised the “intolerance

   

of the Leninists”, that “the Leninists had no right to call themselves
‘Bolsheviks’\thinspace”, that the “terms” were “a mockery of the
International”, and so on.  

On behalf of the I.S.B., Kautsky proposed a resolution for the
unification of the R.S.D.L.P. which affirmed that within Russian
Social-Democracy there were no essential disagreements standing in the way
of unity. Kautsky was supported by the Organising Committee and by
Plekhanov, who violently attacked the C.C. and Lenin. Rosa Luxemburg took
an erroneous stand by joining Plekhanov, Vandervelde, Kautsky and others in
advocating unity between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Since the
Conference was not authorised to pass resolutions, the Bolsheviks and the
Lettish Social-Democrats refused to take part in the voting, but the
resolution of the I.S.B, was carried by a majority. The Polish opposition,
which joined the Bolsheviks and Lettish Social-Democrats at the Conference,
voted for the resolution of the I.S.B.  

Guided by Lenin, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the decisions of the
Brussels Conference. The attempt by the Second International’s opportunist
leaders to liquidate the Bolshevik Party met with failure. In the sight of
the international proletariat, Lenin and the Bolsheviks exposed the true
aims of the leaders of the International, who wore the mask of
peacemakers. For their capable and vigorous defence of the Party line, the
Central Committee passed a vote of thanks to the C. C. delegation at the
Brussels Conference.  

At a private meeting of the liquidators, Trotskyists, Vperyodists,
Plekhanovites, Bundists and representatives of the Caucasian Regional
organisation held after the Brussels Conference, these groups formed a bloc
against the Bolsheviks. The Brussels (“Third of July”) bloc served as a
hypocritical screen concealing the politically rotten position of all its
participants. The bloc shortly afterwards fell apart, showing how false the
policy of the Russian and West-European “uniters” of the R.S.D.L.P. was.





[8]
The Anti-Socialist Law was introduced in Germany in 1878 by
the Bismarck government with the object of combating the labour and
socialist movement. The law banned all Social-Democratic Party and mass
working-class organisations, and the labour press; socialist literature was
confiscated, and Social-Democrats were hounded and deported. These
repressions, however, did not break the Social-Democratic Party, which
readjusted its activities to the conditions of illegal existence: the
Party’s central organ Sozial-Demokrat was published abroad and
Party congresses were held regularly there (1880, 1883, and 1887); in
Germany, Social-Democratic underground organisations and groups headed by
an illegal Central Committee were rapidly restored. Simultaneously, the
Party made wide use of legal opportunities to strengthen contact with the
masses, and its influence steadily grew. The number of votes cast for the
Social-Democrats in the Reichstag elections increased more than threefold
between 1878 and 1890.

   

Tremendous assistance to the German Social-Democrats was given by Karl Marx
and Frederick Engels. The Anti-Socialist Law was repealed in 1890 as a
result of pressure from the mounting mass labour movement.





[9]

“Trusted agents”—leading workers chosen to maintain
constant contact between the C. C. and the local Social-Democratic groups,
and create flexible forms of leadership for local activities in the large
centres of the labour movement.  

The task of establishing a system of trusted agents was set by the
Cracow Conference of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1913.





[10]
The Technical Commission of the Bureau Abroad of the Central
Committee (the Technical Commission Abroad—T. C.)  was set up by the
June Conference of members of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P.  at its sitting of
June 1 (14), 1911, with the aim of carrying out technical functions in
connection with Party publications, transport, etc. As a temporary body
pending the plenary session of the C. C., the Technical Commission was
subordinated to a group of C. C. members who had attended the June
Conference. The T. C. consisted of one representative each from the
Bolsheviks, the conciliators, and the Polish Social-Democrats. The
conciliator majority on the T. C., namely, M. K. Vladimirov, supported by
V. L. Leder, held up the payment of money to the Organising Commission
Abroad or the Party Conference Convocation Fund as well as appropriations
for the publication of the Bolshevik newspaper Zvezda. They tried
to hold up the publication of the Party’s Central Organ—the newspaper
Sotsial-Demokrat. In their organ—Information
Bulletin—the T. C. attacked Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During the
discussion of the “Report” and resolutions of the Russian Organising
Commission at the meeting of the T. C. on October 19 (November 1) the
Bolshevik representative M. F. Vladimirsky moved a resolution accepting
decisions of the Russian Organising Commission, but his proposal was
rejected. Vladimirsky walked out of the Commission, and the Bolsheviks
broke off all contacts with it.





[11]
Russian Organising Commission (R.O.C.) for convening the
All-Russia Party Conference was set up in accordance with the decision of
the June 1911 Conference of members of the R.S.D.L.P.’s Central
Committee. It was constituted at the end of September at a meeting of
representatives of the local Party organisations, and functioned until the
opening of the Sixth (Prague), All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.





[12]
Lenin is referring to the resolution of the “February” 1913 meeting
of the C. C. of the R.S.D.L.P.: “The Revolutionary Upswing, Strikes and
Tasks of the Party”, published in the pamphlet Report and Resolutions
of the Meeting of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. with Party
Workers. February 1913. Published by the C. C. of the R.S.D.L.P.





[13]
The reference is to the shooting down of unarmed workers by the tsarist
troops at the Lena gold-fields in Siberia on April 4 (17), 1912.





[14]
The Social-Democratic Bolshevik organisations in the Caucasus were set
up on the basis of internationalism, uniting within their ranks the
advanced proletarians of different nationalities. Lenin thought very highly
of the activities of the Bolshevik organisations in the Caucasus, and
repeatedly held them up as an example of unity among the workers of all
nations.

On behalf of the German Social-Democratic Party Executive A. Bebel
wrote a letter to Lenin in February 1905, offering himself as arbiter
between the supporters of the Menshevik Iskra and the Bolshevik
newspaper Vperyod. Lenin replied =

“that neither he nor any other Vperyod supporters within his
knowledge had the right to take any action binding upon the whole Party,
and that Bebel’s proposal would therefore have to be submitted to the Party
Congress that was being called by the Russian Bureau”. (See present
edition, Vol. 8, p. 178.) The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. rejected
Bebel’s offer.

It was natural that the open struggle against the
liquidators should flare up more strongly than ever with the formation of
the independent Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma. A more
convenient and plausible excuse for the liquidators of the Party (and for
their overt and covert defenders) to shout about “unity” could not be
imagined. From the point of view of the man in the street, the whole issue
would seem to centre on the question whether one or two Duma groups want to
call them selves Social-Democratic. As to whose will one or the other group
is carrying out, what decisions the majority of the class-conscious and
organised workers have adopted, or what is the “underground”—the man in
the street is incapable of grasping this, and indeed shrinks from doing so.


Therefore, if there was any point on which the liquidators could count
on the sympathy of the man in the street and philistines, who do not care a
hang about parties, it was precisely on the point of what is known as the
“split” in the Social-Democratic group in the Duma. The outcries from
philistines who would call themselves Social-Democrats have never been so
loud and so piteous. The open nature of all these events made it much
easier for the workers and the public at large to appraise them, and
Pravda, in unison with the liquidators’ newspaper, has called upon
the class-conscious proletariat to express its opinion.  

Letters, statements and resolutions from workers have begun to fill the
columns of both newspapers.  
 

Many months have passed since the independent Russian Social-Democratic
Labour group in the Duma was formed (at the end of October 1913). The
campaign of resolutions in the respective newspapers, in favour of the Six
(Russian Social-Democratic Labour group) or of the Seven (the liquidators)
is now over.  

The question arises, what are the results of this campaign? On this
point we have first of all the following statement by Mr. L. Martov in
Nasha Zarya No. 10–11: 


   “What,” writes Mr. L. Martov, “was the proletariat’s
   attitude towards the split in the Duma group, which it had come to look
   upon as a united whole? It is difficult [!?] to judge of this from the
   figures given in the press. Over ten thousand workers expressed their
   opinion on this question in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta and in
   Za Pravdu. Of this number, slightly more than half
   [italics ours] approved of the way the Six had acted. But the significance
   of this preponderance is diminished [listen to this!] by the fact that
   opposition to the split and, consequently, support for the majority in the
   Social-Democratic Duma group, was expressed by numerous Party groups,
   including several which unite a relatively large number of workers.”
   (Nasha Zarya, 1913, No. 10–11, p. 97.)  


So much for Mr. Martov’s argument, which for the thousandth time
glaringly reveals the truly Burenin
methods[6] he employs in distorting the truth! “Slightly more than
half”! Can anything be more evasive? Fifty-one and ninety-nine out of a
hundred would both be “slightly more than half”.  

How can the preponderance be “diminished” by the fact that there were
numerous Party groups? In the first place, no figures are given. The term
“numerous” can be interpreted in whatever way one pleases. One would
think Mr. Martov had deliberately invented the term in order to
conceal the truth. Secondly, and most important: if it is
true that numerous Party groups are supported by a minority of the
workers, then it is obvious that these groups are fictitious, for
only the totally uninformed or inattentive reader will believe
Mr. L. Martov’s suggestion that it is possible for a
non-fictitious group to fail to collect in a news paper
the opinions of all the workers it represents on an important and
burning issue.  

Mr. L. Martov has overreached himself. He has not only admitted that
the majority or the workers have condemned the
liquidationist section of the Duma Social-Democratic

    

group, i.e., the Seven, but also that the liquidators claim to have groups
which are actually fictitious and are not supported by
the workers.  

While acknowledging defeat, Mr. Martov, by his reference to fictitious
“groups”, tried to conceal, à la Burenin, the
magnitude of this defeat. And that is the crux of the matter. As
regards the magnitude of this defeat, exact figures were published
and reported to Martov’s friends at the meeting of the International
Socialist Bureau as far back as December 1 (14), 1913! Why did not
the liquidators ever say a single word in the press about these
figures?  Was it because their conscience was not clear?  

These figures gave the results up to November 20, 1913: Only the
signatures attached to pronouncements by workers were taken, i.e.,
data of the most precise kind, which have never been
challenged. These figures show 4,850 signatures in favour of the Six, and
only 2,539 (of which 1,086 came from the Bund and 636 from the Caucasus) in
favour of the liquidators, i. e., of the Seven.  

Now ask yourselves how the methods of a writer should be qualified who
tries to assure the public that the preponderance of the opponents of
liquidationism is “diminished” by the fact that there were “numerous”
(fictitious) groups, which together succeeded in obtaining all
over Russia the support of only one-third of the workers who
expressed their opinions!  

Below we give the number of signatures attached to definitely
expressed resolutions published in both newspapers during the whole
period of the campaign (which ended at the beginning of January);

The liquidators have so corrupted their readership with their
incredibly brazen reiteration of false, absolutely unsupported and
absolutely unverifiable statements, that we cannot stress the importance of
the above-quoted figures too strongly. They have been taken from both rival
newspapers, and any literate person can verify our calculation, and make
his own.  

These figures give us a highly illuminating picture of the state of
Party affairs among Marxists in Russia. No other political party in Russia
can show, for the whole period of the counter-revolution in general and for
1913 in particular, a similar open and mass opinion poll of all its
members on a most important issue of Party life. None of the legalised
parties in Russia, none of the wealthy liberal and democratic parties,
which have a host of intellectualist forces and all sorts of publications
at their command, has done as much as the party of the working class, the
party of propertyless proletarians, who have been driven underground and
maintain their newspaper with the kopeks they collect.  

The workers’ party has set all parties in Russia an example of
how the masses of the rank-and-file members should be
drawn into an open and all-round discussion of controversial issues. The
liberals and philistines of all parties, of all ages and of all types, are
fond of bewailing the “splits” in the ranks of the
Social-Democrats. These good souls do not realise that it is impossible to
carry out the will of the majority without a struggle; and unless the will
of the majority is carried out there is no use talking about the Party
spirit, or even of organised political action in general.  

By “unity”, foolish people mean a “system” under which thirteen
members of the Duma act in defiance of the will of the
majority of the organised and class-conscious Marxist workers of
Russia; by a “split” they mean the formation, by the six Duma members, of
an independent group acting in harmony with this majority of
workers, with the purpose of carrying out its will.  

Do not these foolish people cut a ridiculous figure? Are they not
contemptible?  

It should now be clear to everybody, except to those who are out to
deceive the workers, that the much bruited “unity” of the thirteen
deputies (about which the liquidators and

    

conciliators talk so much) was actually the flouting of the will
of the Party, mockery of the will of the majority of the workers.


And vice versa. Consider the matter from another angle. No person in
his right mind has ever attempted to question the fact that in the summer
of 1913 a conference of Marxists (far from open) was held, whose
decision, endorsed by the leading body of the Party, became the Party’s
will and decision. This decision demanded that the Six should act

    independently.[1]

You vilify this conference, Messrs. liquidators and conciliators? You call
it a circle, a packed meeting, a piece of fiction, etc.? Very well! But
your abuse only expresses your impotence, for the objective facts are
indisputable: by a decision of this “circle”, two-thirds of the
class-conscious workers of Russia came out to the man in favour of
the conference, in favour of carrying out its will.  

This is precisely what we call a party, you gentlemen who
babble about “unity”, but, by “unity”, mean permitting the
liquidators to flout the will of the Party.  

Note that with two rival dailies there could be no question of anybody
trying to prevent even a single class-conscious worker from expressing his
opinion if he desired to do so. As it turned out, less than a third
supported the liquidators; and of the total number of votes cast for the
liquidators, more than half came from the Bund and the Caucasus. Moreover,
the figures we have quoted contain hardly any signatures of
Lettish workers (there were 98 signatures for the Six and 70 for the
liquidators, whereas, among the Lettish workers who voted on this question
with out giving their signatures, 863 voted for the Six and 347 for the
liquidators); nor do they contain the votes of over 800 Polish
Social-Democratic workers who also voted for the Six but did not give their
signatures (in the same way, about 400 supporters of the Left wing voted
for the liquidators).  
    

WHAT is SHOWN by the ACTIVITIES of the TWO GROUPS DURING the FIRST
QUARTER

We cannot dwell here upon the political content of these
activities. This most interesting question of how the activities of the Six
have gained from the needs, demands, views and will of the
majority of the workers now being proclaimed from the Duma rostrum
must regretfully be left for another occasion. We shall merely state
briefly that in the speeches they delivered on March 4, 1914; Badayev and
Malinovsky, spokesmen of the Six in the Duma, formulated for
the first time the question of freedom of the press, not in a
liberal manner, but in a manner worthy of the proletariat, whereas the
liquidators, both in the literary world and in the columns of their
newspapers, as well as in the speeches delivered in the Duma by their Seven
floundered on this question in a purely liberal manner. One may read in
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta of as recent a date as March 13, on
p. 2 of that issue, an argument to the effect that “advertising the
illegal press can only weaken the workers’ struggle for their legal
press”. How important it was in principle to form an independent
Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma to combat shameful
renegade statements and opinions of the kind just quoted, has already been
stressed in this volume and will be stressed again more than once.  

For the moment, we shall undertake the more modest task of drawing our
readers’ attention to the “external”, if one may so express it, evidence
showing what the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the
Duma at once became as distinct from the seven liquidators.  

Each Duma group publishes in its newspaper the financial reports of its
treasurer, showing the sums that have passed through its hands. These sums,
designated for the relief of comrades in prison or in exile, for aid to
strikers in different factories and industries, and for various other needs
of the working-class movement, reveal to us a number of aspects of
working-class life; they strikingly reveal—by exact,
indisputable and impartial figures—what links each of the groups
in the Duma has with the working-class movement.  
 

In both newspapers and in both Duma groups, the latest report of this
kind covers the period up to January 21, 1914. Thus, we have
reports for only three months of the period during which the two
groups have existed separately, viz., from the end of October to the end of
January. The following is a summary of the reports of the two groups for
the quarter mentioned: 


Collections handled by the Duma groups (in rubles)


 
Total collections
From non- workers
From workers
Number of workers’ groups




1) By the R.S.D.L. group . . 
6,173.00
71.31
6,101.69
719


2) By the S.D. group . . 
2,212.78
765.80
1,446.98


  94[2]





These bare figures give us a remarkably striking picture of the
organisational contacts and of the whole life of the two Duma
groups. The number of workers’ groups which addressed the Duma group of
liquidators during the quarter is almost one-eighth of the number
that addressed the Duma group of Party men.  
 

On the other hand, the amount received by the liquidationist group from
=

 non-workers[3]

is ten times as much as that received by the R.S.D.L. group from
this source: 765 rubles as against 71 rubles. Collections from
non-workers[4]

received by the Party men are one per cent of the total sum
collected (71 rubles out of 6,173 rubies). Collections from this source
received by the liquidators are thirty-four per cent of the total
sum collected (765 rubles out of 2,213 rubles).  

These figures enable the general public, who are unfamiliar with the
activities of the Duma groups, to weigh up exactly and give thorough
thought to facts which people familiar with the life of the groups have
gleaned from a thousand and one “trifles” of everyday life, namely: 

that the liquidationist group (the Seven) is a group
without workers.  

that the liquidationist group has thirty times as many
contacts with non-worker circles than the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
group.  

These facts were commented on long ago and from different angles. The
liberal newspaper Rech rightly called the liquidationist group a
group of “intellectuals”, and the entire liberal press has endorsed this
over and over again. Plekhanov long ago pointed out that the liquidators
have taken into their ranks quite a number of petty-bourgeois opportunist
elements, in addition to Mr. Potresov. The numerous contributors to liberal
newspapers in the ranks of the liquidators and vice versa (Enzis,
Yegorov, S. Novich, Y. Smirnov, Antid Oto, Nevedomsky, Lvov-Rogachevsky,
Cherevanin,[7] and many others) have been named by Put Pravdy.


In point of social significance, the liquidators are essentially a
branch of the liberal-bourgeois party, whose aim is to instil into the
proletarian midst the ideas of liberal-labour policy and to flout
the will of the majority of the organised and class-conscious workers of
Russia.

The above figures cover the period only up to January 21, 1914 (from
the time the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group was formed, i. e., from
the end of October 1913).  

We consider it our duty to quote fuller figures from the calculations
made by Comrade V.A.T. for the whole period beginning from the formation of
the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group to June 1914.  

The following are the figures (in rubles) of the collections (for
relief for comrades in prison or in exile, etc.), which, according to
reports in the Marxist and liquidationist newspapers, were handled by the
respective Duma groups between October 1913 and June 6, 1914:

From non- workers

1,295


By the S.D. group      
6,114.87
2,828.04
8,286,83
215




The Russian Social-Democratic Labour group received from non-workers
six per cent of the total sum collected, whereas the liquidationist
(“S.D.”)  group received 46 per cent from this source. The number of
workers’ groups that addressed the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group
is 85.7 per cent of the total (1,295 out of 1,510), while the number that
addressed the “S.D.” group is 14.3 per cent of the total.  —Lenin

The article “How the Workers Responded to the Formation of the

symposium Marxism and Liquidationism, Part II, from the newspaper
Za Pravdu. Lenin wrote the article in March-April 1914, and
supplemented it in June with fresh material concerning money contributions
to the Marxist and liquidationist newspapers handled by the Duma
groups. (See p. 542 of this volume.) The article contains a number of
preparatory materials. The Central Party Archive of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism under the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U. is in
possession of Lenin’s manuscript calculations of the signatures in favour
of the Bolshevik Six and the Menshevik Seven, calculations of the

Social-Democratic Labour group and the Social-Democratic group in the Duma
between October 1913 and June 6 (19), 1914.

1. PEOPLE HOLDING TWO OPINIONS

Can people obviously incapable of taking serious problems
seriously, themselves be taken seriously? It is difficult to do so,
comrades, very difficult! But the question which certain people cannot
treat seriously is in itself so serious that it will do no harm to examine
even patently frivolous replies to it.  

This serious question is that of the unity of the Russian working-class
movement. Contributors to Yedinstvo are people incapable of
treating this question seriously.  

Here is the first example. In issue No. 4, Yedinstvo has
published an interview with deputy Chkheidze. The editors of
Yedinstvo have expressed the hope that this interview will help
“to unite the Russian working class”. Very good. But let us see what
Chkheidze has said about the organisational and tactical questions that
interest the Russian workers.  

Chkheidze has expressed himself as follows: “I am personally in full
agreement with the views on tactics and organisation lately expounded in
the press by Comrade An.”  

What views has Comrade An lately expounded in the press?  

What, for example, has he said about the views of the Luchists,
alias the liquidators?  

An, a prominent Menshevik and opponent of Pravdism, “has lately
expounded in the press” the view that “the liquidators are steering a
course towards reforms”, that their

    

views on the “underground”, strikes, “uncurtailed slogans”, and so
forth, are inseparably connected with their general reformism; that if the
workers heeded their advice, the workers in the provinces would have to
refrain from organising strikes, and so forth.  

These views have indicated that An is beginning to free himself from
captivity to the liquidators, and we have welcomed this.  

Now Chkheidze says that he is “in full” agreement with these
views. We are very glad to hear it. An understanding of the nature of
liquidationism and emphatic renunciation of it is the beginning of wisdom,
is it not? And we would be ready to welcome deputy Chkheidze’s long-delayed
awakening to the role played by liquidationism as a trend.  

But serious questions should be treated seriously, and it will be
useful therefore to examine, not only Chkheidze’s statements in
Yedinstvo, but his actions as well.  

The reply of the Social-Democratic Duma group (of which deputy
Chkheidze is chairman) to the terms of unity proposed by the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour group might have been of vast importance to the
cause of unity.  

That reply appeared not very long ago in Nasha Rabochaya
Gazeta, issue No. 2, in the form of an appeal to the workers.  

In this appeal to the workers, deputy Chkheidze and his fellow-thinkers
reply, among others, to the question of their attitude towards
liquidationism as represented by the latter’s organ, at that time
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta.  


   “As for the Marxist Severnaya Rabochaya
   Garcia,” deputy Chkheidze and his friends write, “our attitude
   towards it can be defined as complete solidarity with its trend.”
   


Thus, in an official appeal to the workers, deputy Chkheidze has
announced his “complete solidarity” with the trend of the
liquidationist newspaper, and in the interview published in
Yedinstvo he has stated that he is in “lull agreement”
with the views of An, who has criticised this newspaper as an organ of the
reformists who are hampering the present-day working-class movement.  
 

Is such a thing permissible? Does this indicate a serious attitude
towards a serious question? Has deputy Chkheidze anything serious to say on
the question of unity with the liquidators, considering that in the space
of two months he has contrived to express two diametrically opposite views
on the liquidators?  

But, we may be told, when the “Open Reply of the Social-Democratic
Group” was being drafted, deputy Chkheidze was probably not yet aware of
An’s views, and was there fore unable as yet to appreciate the
significance of liquidationism.  

Alas, this will not be in keeping with the truth, for An’s article was
published long before the “Open Reply” appeared.  

Another thing that must be borne in mind is this.  

Several days after An’s articles appeared, L. M. in Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta, came out strongly in defence of the liquidators
against An’s criticism. And what about Chkheidze? Did he utter a single
word in defence of views with which he now appears to be in “full
agreement”? No. Chkheidze kept quiet, while deputy Tulyakov, a
fellow-member of his group, chose that very moment to come forward as
publisher of Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta.  

We repeat: is it permissible for the Chairman of the Social-Democratic
group in the Duma to adopt such an attitude towards a question that is
agitating the broad masses of the workers and has been repeatedly discussed
at meetings, conferences, etc.? Has Chkheidze made any contribution to the
solution of the problem of unity? Is this not an attempt to obscure the
question of unity by means of parochial diplomatic considerations designed
to save the liquidators?  

This is the common failing of our “uniters”: they cannot give a clear
answer to questions of the day; they do not themselves know what they want.


One thing is clear from their writings: they want to save the
liquidators, and must therefore avoid clarity and precision in the
formulation and solution of problems.  

To the liquidators clarity and precision are the most dangerous things
at the present time. Other articles in Yedinstvo bring this home
to us still more forcibly.  
 

But the workers want clarity, and they will get it, for they want to
build up the unity of their organisation, not on the basis of diplomacy and
equivocation, but on the basis of a precise appraisal of the political
significance of the different “trends”. People who have two or even more
opinions on this question are, poor counsellors.

It is only now that we are able to sum up some of
the results of Workers’ Press Day of
April 22.[2] 

The second anniversary of the newspaper Pravda became a day of
review of the Marxist forces.  

On that day all class-conscious workers came to the assistance of their
working-class newspapers, and hundreds and thousands of rubles were
collected kopek by kopek.  

The latest report on sums collected on Workers’ Press Day was published
only on June 14, in issue No. 15 of Trudovaya Pravda. Press Day
lasted nearly two months.  

“Better late than never,” many comrades wrote, contributing their
mite after April 22.  

Resolutions received by the editors have been so numerous that it has
been impossible to list them all, let alone publish them.  

But they have had the desired effect. They have convinced us that we
are on the right road, and that the vast majority of the workers have
accepted the slogans of consistent Marxism.  

As is well known, the liquidators proclaimed the second anniversary of
the newspapers of the Pravda trend as Press Day for their own
newspaper, too. They raised a hullaballoo at the time to prove that they
had a right to participate in Press Day precisely on April 22. Already at
that time they proposed federation, an equal sharing of all the money
collected. April 22 showed that the liquidationist newspaper had spoken too
soon about “federation” and “equality”.  

The workers of St. Petersburg flatly rejected the proposal for
“general collections”. This call on the part of the liquidationist

    

newspaper evoked a certain response only among a section of the students,
and in a few factories in the provinces.  

The sums obtained by general collections hardly affected the total
amount of Press Day collections. Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta, issue
No. 34, for June 13, already attempted to compare the collections made for
that newspaper with those made for Put Pravdy. We say an attempt,
because the comparison made by Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta cannot
possibly be regarded as final and complete. If we wanted to obtain such a
complete comparison from Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta we should have to
wait till doomsday, for it is greatly to the liquidators’ advantage to
quote general figures with out going into a detailed analysis of the
amounts, and with out ascertaining the sources they came from.  

Consequently, we must ourselves undertake the task of analysing the
liquidators’ reports.  

Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta has arrived at highly gratifying
conclusions, namely,
(1) that the Pravdists have the backing of somewhat under three-fifths of
the class-conscious workers of Russia, and
(2) that the Pravdists predominate strongly only in St. Petersburg, whereas
in the provinces the reverse is the case; there the supporters of Nasha
Rabochaya Gazeta predominate.  

First of all, we must make a slight addition to the figures of our
total collections which Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta has quoted from
Trudovaya Pravda of June 11. In that issue, the total figures were
given up to June 1, but as Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta gives the total
of its collections up to June 10, we must, to make a fair comparison, add
the amounts collected from June 1 to June 10, reported in issue No. 15, of
June 14. Moreover, the figures up to June 10 were not quite accurate, as
certain small contributions received from the provinces were included in
the figures for St. Petersburg.  

After making these corrections we obtain the following final amounts,
which we shall quote in the course of this article.  





Collected in St. Petersburg . . . . . . . . . . .

R.
946.55


   Total  . . . . . . . . . . . .
R.
11,801.80




At first sight the difference is not very great and would seem to show
that Nasha Rabochaya Gazeta has the backing of two-fifths of the
class-conscious workers. But as soon as these figures are distributed by
source, namely, contributions from workers and non-workers, the picture
changes completely.  

The country-wide response to the appeal by Put Pravdy on
Workers Press Day was: 1,915 workers’ groups, which collected
R.16,163.71.  

The response to the appeal by Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta was:
588 workers’ groups, which collected R.5,651.78.  

From non-workers, Put Pravdy received R.1,842.53, whereas
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta received from this source R.6,062.02,
i. e., more than it received from workers.  

These figures on the collections made for Workers’ Press Day reveal
much the same thing as the figures of the collections and groups during the
period commencing January 1, 1914. Of the total number of workers’ groups
which responded on Workers’ Press Day, only a little over one-fifth
responded to the liquidationist newspaper’s appeal, this despite the
liquidators’ efforts to change the balance of forces in their favour on the
eve of Workers’ Press Day. In this they failed. Four-fifths of the
class-conscious workers support Pravdism. This fact, deduced from the
figures covering the entire period of two years that the legal news papers
have been in existence, was also confirmed on Workers’ Press Day.


Let us now examine the situation in St. Petersburg and in the
provinces. In St. Petersburg the number of collections (groups) made for
the Pravdist newspaper amounted to 1,276, and the sum collected
totalled R.10,762.46. The corresponding figures for the liquidators’
newspaper were 224 and R.2,306.27. The difference is so striking
that even the liquidators do not dare deny that the Pravdists predominate

    

among the most advanced, energetic, organised and politically experienced
proletariat of the capital city.  

But they claim the provinces.  


   “In the provinces,” wrote Nasha Rabochaya Ooze
   to, “we see the reverse of things in St. Petersburg. In the provinces
   Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta alone collected more than the
   Pravdist organ.”  


This is a sample of deception, which we strongly advise our
comrades, the workers, to examine very closely. What is true is true: in
the provinces the Pravdists collected R.6,325.28 and the liquidators
R.6,409.12. More, is it not? But please look at the following figures.


In the provinces, the Pravdist newspaper received R.5,401.25
from 639 workers’ groups and R.924.03 from non-workers.  

But the liquidationist newspaper received R.3,345.51 from
364 workers’ groups and R.3,004.89 from 78 groups of
non-workers and from individuals.  

Yes, in the provinces the liquidators undoubtedly predominate,
only not among the workers, but among wealthy “friends and sympathisers”.


The liquidators did a very simple thing. To prove that they
“predominate” in the provinces they lumped the workers’ kopeks
with the large sums contributed by their friends among the bourgeoisie, and
thereby “squashed” the Pravdists!  

A clever move, perhaps, but in doing so, good gentlemen, you have not
proved your preponderance in the provinces, but merely that you are no less
divorced from the workers in the provinces than you are from the
St. Petersburg workers.  

What counts in establishing a working-class press and a
working-class body is not big contributions from wealthy
“friends”, but the activities of the workers themselves.  

The fact that in building up a working-class newspaper and a
working-class body the liquidators received nearly as much from non-workers
as they did from workers (R.5,115 and R.5,651) is, in our opinion,not an
advantage, but a shortcoming; it is only further proof of the close
connection between liquidationism and bourgeois intellectualist circles.


We, on our part, are proud that our “cast-iron reserve” consists
almost entirely of kopeks from workers who, in the course of six weeks,
collected over R.16,000 for their newspaper.  
 

How was this sum made up? Workers of which trades and areas helped in
one degree or another to establish a consistently Marxist newspaper?  

The answer to this is given in the following table, a document highly
characteristic of the present state of the working-class movement. This
table shows the Sums received by Put Pravdy from various
industries (trades). The list is headed by the metalworkers, of
course. Greetings to you, comrades!

ST. PETERSBURG

During the past few years St. Petersburg has been at the head of the
working-class movement. While the proletariat in some (now few) parts of
the provinces cannot yet rouse themselves from the lethargy of 1907–11,
and in other parts are only just taking the first steps to fall into line
with the St. Petersburg proletariat, the latter has developed tremendous
activity and, like a delicate barometer, has reacted to all events of
concern, to the working-class movement. The St. Petersburg proletariat is
in the forefront. Even Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta will scarcely
attempt to deny this.  

And this is how the St. Petersburg proletariat responded to Workers’
Press Day.  

Collections for Put Pravdy were made here by 1,276 groups,
which gave R.10,762.46; for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta collections
were made by 224 groups, which gave R.2,306.27.  

Counting by the number of groups, the liquidators in the working-class
movement in St. Petersburg are supported not by one-fifth but by
one-seventh of the class-conscious workers; their collections amount only
to a little over one-sixth of those made by the Pravdists.  

These figures show that the bulk of the St. Petersburg proletariat,
which stands at the head of the working-class movement, has turned away
from the liquidators and supports the old and uncurtailed slogans.  

Even among the printers, that sole refuge of the liquidators among the
organised workers, nearly five times as much was collected for the Pravdist
press as was collected for the liquidationist press (R.966.34 for Put
Pravdy, as against R.201.21 for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta).


The same thing is shown by the collections among the
metalworkers. Here, Put Pravdy collected R.5.075.49 as against R.1,283.66 collected for
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta, i. e., four times as much; during the
union’s existence this was confirmed by the constant defeats of the
liquidators at elections, general meetings, etc.  

Among other trades in St. Petersburg, the position of the liquidators
is still worse. Woodworkers, for example, contributed

    

R.1,014.73 to Put Pravdy, but only
   R.38.14[1]

to Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta.  

The liquidationist press has often proclaimed from the house-tops that
only the most ignorant masses, who do not understand serious questions,
follow the lead of Pravda. In the recently published June issue of
Nasha Zarya, the overzealous liquidator, Mr. A. Gorev, asserts
that the collections and resolutions in support of Pravda “come
from those sections of the workers who, for the first time in the history
of the Russian working-class movement, are being drawn into the sphere of
Interests and controversies of Social Democracy”—from the midst of the
ignorant, non-class-conscious youth and backward workers.  

Do the liquidators dare include in those “sections” the metalworkers
and printers, who have always been in the forefront of the working-class
movement? Mr. Gorev, of course, has no evidence whatever in support of his
argument, which is based entirely on subjective assumptions. Well, let him
keep to them. We have however proved with the aid of irrefutable figures
that even among advanced trades like the printers and metalworkers of
St. Petersburg, the liquidators have the support of barely one-fifth of the
workers.  

Lack of space prevents us from quoting the comparative figures of the
collections in all the other trades. We shall therefore quote only the
total figures for these trades.  

In addition to the trades already enumerated, Put Pravdy
received R.3,700 from workers, and Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta
R.500.00 (in round figures). These sums were contributed by shop
assistants, tailors, tanners, textile workers, bakers, and other workers
engaged in small industry.  

Here, too, Put Pravdy received seven times as much as
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta did. Not a single trade contributed
more to Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta than it did to Put
Pravdy. Even office and other salaried employees collected R.273.11
for Put Pravdy, whereas for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta
the office employees and shop assistants

    

combined (figures quoted by Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta) collected
R.262.32. The shop assistants collected R.238.11 for Put Pravdy.


In addition, we give below a list of the factories that were most
active in collecting funds for their workers’ newspaper: 

1) the Novy Aivaz Works—R.791.37 (for Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta—R.464.67);
2) the Putilov Works—R.335.46 (for Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta—R.59.38);
3) the St. Petersburg Metalworks—R.273.36 (for Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta—R.116.92);
4) the Tubing Works—R.243.80 (for Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta—R.113.41);
5) Siemens Schuckert—R.229.26;
6) Erickson—R.228.82 (for Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta—R.55.13);
=

7) Perviainen—R.183.93;
8) the Old LessnerWorks—R.168.30;
9) the France-Russian Works—R.148.82;
10) the New Lessner Works—R.116.25;
11) the Gable Works—R.112.62;
12) Siemens-Halske—R.104.30;
13) the Obukhov Works—R.91.02;
14) the Stationery Of flce—R.79.12 (for Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta—R.54.00).[3] 

 
Notes
 

[1]
We ask Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta in advance to excuse us if,
in examining its reports, we omitted one or two workshops, whose trades
were not specified. This Would not have happened had Severnaya
Rabochaya Gazeta tabulated its figures in greater detail.  —Lenin

April 22 (May 5), 1912 was the date when the first issue of the mass
working-class newspaper Pravda appeared. In its issue No. 42, of
March 21 (April 3), 1914, the newspaper Put Pravdy published an
open letter by “a group of Pravdists” calling for April 22, 1914 to be
proclaimed Workers’ Press Day in honour of the appearance of the daily
Bolshevik newspaper.  

The workers in Russia responded enthusiastically to this appeal,
Pravda’s second birthday being commemorated by the Bolsheviks with
a drive towards strengthening and extending contacts between the newspaper
and the working-class masses.





[3]
At the end of the article there is an editorial note: “To be
continued”. The promised sequel, however, was not given in succeeding
issues, and on July 8 (21), 1914, the paper closed down. The day after this
article was published “A Correction to the Report” was given in
Trudovaya Pravda for July 4, 1914, stating that “in yesterday’s
issue of the paper the article ‘The Results of Worker’s Press Day Summed
Up’ gave the figure 79 rubles 12 kopeks from the Stationery Office. This
should read 133 rubles 32 kopeks.”

The fact that the Polish Social-Democratic opposition at
the Brussels Conference sided with the liquidators came as a surprise to
many Party people and as a shock to all of them. The Polish
Social-Democratic opposition was believed to be as close to the Pravdists
as the Letts were. And suddenly we find the Letts at their post against the
liquidators, while the Polish Social-Democrats played us false!  

What is the reason?  

The reason is that there are two trends among the Polish
Social-Democrats: some of them want to remove Tyszka and Rosa Luxemburg in
order to continue Tyszka’s policy themselves. This is a policy of
unprincipled diplomacy and “playing” between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks,
between the Party and its liquidators. Voting for one side today, for
another tomorrow. Under the guise of “impartiality”, betrayal of all in
turn, driving a bargain and securing “advantages and privileges” for
oneself. The clauses of a federative character in the Stockholm (1906)
agreement between the Polish and Russian
Social-Democrats[1] were a useful weapon for this nasty policy, which
Tyszka and Rosa Luxemburg were conducting with such consummate skill.  

The other trend stands for a complete breakaway from the liquidators,
from federalism, from “playing” the role, of “pendulum” between the two
conflicting sides: it stands for a sincere and close alliance with the
Pravdists, with the Party.  

In Brussels the former trend among the Polish Social-Democrats won the
day. As a result, there can obviously be nothing but absolute mistrust on
our part towards the Polish Social-Democrats, The future will show whether
the other

    

trend will succeed in rallying itself and in raising a clear, precise and
definite banner of a consistent, high-principled policy, a policy aimed,
not only against the group of Tyszka but against the essence of Tyszka’s
methods. Needless to say, the unity of the Polish Social-Democratic
proletariat is possible only on the basis of such a policy.  

The forthcoming steps towards such unity will definitely reveal the
true state of affairs among the Polish social Democrats and will thereby
determine our own attitude to wards them.

This refers to the conditions for the amalgamation of the
Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania with the R.S.D.L.P. adopted at the
Fourth (Unity) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1906 in Stockholm.

Leipziger Volkszeitung, issue No. 157 for July 11,
1914, published an article over the signature of Z. L. entitled “On the
Question of Unity in Russia”. The writer’s lack of objectivity compels us
to draw the attention of the German comrades to certain facts. For the sake
of graphic illustration, we quote the following table which was published
in
   Pravda.[1]

1.
We gave the exact dates for which these figures were calculated (from
January 1 to May 13, 1914). The liquidators gave no dates. Would it be
honest, in such a case, to compare facts that are incomparable and
unauthentic?  

2.
The liquidators themselves stated and published in the press (Nasha
Rabochaya Gazeta No. 34) that all their groups, i. e., not
the workers’ groups alone, totalled 948. Our statistics, on the other hand,
specified that the figures 2,873 and 671 referred to workers’ groups
alone. The total number of groups is given in our table,
and that number does not coincide with the number of workers’
groups. Is it honest to pass this over in silence?  

3.
Our newspaper reported that we gave the contributions made by the workers’
groups for both newspapers and that we had no information about recurrent
contributions by the same groups. The information was the same for both
news papers. It is absolutely incomprehensible how any honest critic could
discover an “error” here!  

4.
We quoted parallel figures, that is, figures covering the same
period for both newspapers, and the information for both papers was
tabulated by the same method.  

The liquidators quoted no parallel figures at all, thus violating the
most elementary and well-known rules of statistical work. Anyone who is
interested in this question can easily get both newspapers and verify our
information.  

We are sure that no open-minded person can call the methods used by the
“critic” Z. L. honest.
