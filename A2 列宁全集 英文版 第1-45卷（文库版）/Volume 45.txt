6.XI.1920

Comrade Sereda:

I consider the articles by Michelson, which you have
sent me, of exceptional
importance.[2]

It is necessary:

1) To send them over at once to Izvestia and Pravda
(having corrected the style, put them together into one
article and edited).

2) To supply an afterword by you: conclusions (practical
conclusions).

3) To send a concise extract to
ROSTA[1]

for circulation
in Russia.

4) To include all this without fail α) in your printed
report to the Congress of Soviets on 20.XII, β) in your oral
report (the gist and practical conclusions).

All this should be prepared in advance, and the
specialists must be made to perform all the works preparatory to
your report in good time.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

[2]
In his articles sent to S. P. Sereda Prof. V. A. Michelson of
the Petrovsko-Razumovskaya Agricultural Academy (now the
Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in Moscow), Basing himself
on scientific data, wrote about the periodical succession of dry
and rainy years. Predicting the advent of an early drought,
he said it could be combated by higher labour productivity
both in industry and agriculture. On Lenin’s instructions,
Michelson’s article was published in Izvestia VTslK No. 258
on November 17, 1920, under the title “Important
Warning”, and the following day the paper carried Sereda’s article,
“About the Article ‘Important Warning’”, which dealt with the
concrete measures necessary to prevent a crop failure.

On November 25, 1920, Sereda wrote to Lenin: “Vladimir
Ilyich, I have carried out your instructions concerning the
publication of Prof. Michelson’s article on the coming drought
(Izvestia No. 258) and my own item about his article (Izvestia No. 259,
which I enclose).

“I also sent them to Pravda, but they were not published
because Izvestia had carried both earlier.” A short note was sent to
the Telegraph Agency of Russia (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

R.M.C. Southern Front


Copy to Trotsky

I have just learned about your surrender offer to =
Wrangel.[1] Extremely surprised at the excessively
accommodating terms. If the enemy accepts them, make sure of taking
over the fleet and not letting out a single ship; if the enemy
rejects these terms, I think they must not be repeated, and
the enemy dealt with ruthlessly.

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In an effort to avoid farther bloodshed, M. V. Frunze, commander    

of the troops on the Southern Front, radioed an offer to Wrangel    

on November 11, 1920, to cease resistance, promising an amnesty     

for those who laid down their arms. Wrangel did not reply to        

Frunze’s proposal and concealed it from his troops.

Perhaps we could establish the following order
concerning the number of workers’ supply rations:

1) Establish the minimum number of rations in
numerical order, say:

ration No. 1 ordinary, minimum


” No. 2 so much higher


” No. 3

. . . . . . . .


etc., up to No. 10, the highest ration, if the total number
of rations could be confined to 10.

2) Determine monthly how many consumers (industrial
or office workers plus members of their families) are
receiving under each ration.

If we managed to do this, we could first find out exactly
how many ration groups there are;

Second, we could easily switch separate groups from one
ration to another;

And third, we should always know how much has
actually been issued and to how many workers.

Comrade Kalinin:

I am sending you the draft resolutions on the Siberian
concessions which have been passed by the committee (these
drafts will be submitted to the Council of People’s
Commissars for approval possibly next
week[1]). One other
question, namely, that of food concessions, has still to be worked
out in sufficient detail.

Will you press forward with this matter on the lines
we discussed today.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Siberian Concessions Committee was set up by a C.P.C.
decision of October 30, 1920, and on November 16 it submitted its

   

draft decree to the C.P.C. The latter appointed an ad hoc
committee (V. I. Lenin, D. I. Kursky, A. M. Lezhava, V. P.
Milyutin and S. P. Sereda) to rework and edit the draft decree
within a week. On November 23, the C.P.C. adopted a decree on
concessions and approved the committee’s proposal to publish a
pamphlet on concessions. At the end of 1920, it appeared under
the title 0 kontsessiyakh. Dekret Soveta. Narodnykh Komissarov ot
23 noyabrya 1920 g. Tekst dekreta. Obyekty kontsessii. Karty. (On
Concessions. Decree of the Council of People’s Commissars of

Please inform me at once about your conclusion on
Baryshnikov’s invention of a sole leather substitute, and what
you are doing about it if you have found the invention
useful.[1]

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with a letter seat to Lenin on November
7, 1920, by Y. G. Parfyonov, extraordinary and plenipotentiary
Uyezd Commissar for Food of the Tambov Gubernia Executive
Committee, who said that engineer A. A. Baryshnikov’s
invention was not being tested fast enough and asked Lenin to issue
instructions to have it applied in production as soon as possible.

On November 19, 1920, Lenin received a reply to his inquiry
(see next document) which stated that the Inventions Committee
of the Scientific and Technical Department of the Supreme
Economic Council had examined Baryshnikov’s application submitted
to the Committee on September 15, and had on September 30
issued to him a claim certificate. The Committee said
Baryshnikov’s invention differed little from earlier ones, while the quality
of the leather was to be ascertained by means of tests; the initial
tests carried out by the Central Administration of the Leather
Industry (Glavkozha) had been unfavourable, and Baryshnikov
was working to improve his invention. The final conclusion
would be drawn as a result of further tests.

I have accepted almost all of
N. K.’s[1]

corrections and
suggest another one: an addition on combining political
and scientific educational work. Zinoviev’s draft can be
adopted with these corrections and
additions.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Nadezhda Krupskaya.—Ed.
 



[2]
A reference to the remarks and additions made by Nadezhda
Krupskaya to the draft letter of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee, “On the Proletcults” (Proletarian Culture Organisations),
whose initial variant had been drawn up by G. Y. Zinoviev and

   

further elaborated on the basis of remarks by the members of the
Central Committee and the People’s Commissariat for
Education. Krupskaya proposed the following fundamental addition
to the letter: “The Proletcult emerged before the October
Revolution. It was proclaimed an ‘independent,’ workers’
organisation, unconnected with the Ministry of Public Education under
Kerensky. The October Revolution changed the prospect. The
Proletcults continued to remain ‘independent’, but now they
were ‘independent’ of the Soviet power.” The following was
also accepted in her wording: “Instead of helping proletarian
youth to engage in serious study and making its communist
approach to ail the aspects of life and art more profound, artists
and philosophers essentially remote from and hostile to
communism, but proclaiming themselves to be truly proletarian, hampered
the workers....” And further: “Far from wishing to constrict the
initiative of the working-class intelligentsia in the sphere of
creative art, the Central Committee wants to create for it a
healthier and more normal atmosphere and to enable it to leave its
mark on the whole of creative art” (Voprosy Istorii
KPSS—Questions of the C.P.S.U. History—1958, No. 1, p. 36). Nadezhda
Krupskaya also made various other minor corrections in the
draft letter.

Lenin directed and took a personal part in working out the
C.C. letter, an important Party document, based on the
instructions which he set out in the draft resolution, “On Proletarian

                         Comrade Anikst

In view of the statement by Comrade Korolyov,
Chairman of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Executive
Committee, concerning the non-fulfilment of the C.L.D. decision
of
5--X–20,[1] and in view of the extreme importance of the
uninterrupted running of the textile mills in
Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia, which in six months can produce
2.88 million 60-arshin piece-goods, i.e., 172.8 million
arshins—I hereby instruct you to organise not later than

    

tomorrow, 16-XI-20, under your chairmanship, a conference
consisting of Comrade Korolyov and representatives:

on matters
relating
to each
department
respectively

from the People’s Commissariat for Food

Central Fuel Administration

Central Oil Administration

Central Peat Administration

People’s Commissariat for Defence

People’s Commissariat for Finance

People’s Commissariat for Railways

on the various questions raised by the Ivanovo-Voznesensk   Gubernia Executive Committee, to work out precise  -4 decisions and to submit them to me for signature or to the   C.L.D. at 6.00 p.m. sharp on Wednesday,
17–XI–20.[2]

15.XI.20

Chairman, Council of Labour and Defence
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the decision, “On fuel and food supplies to tie
factories being restarted in Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia, included
in the shock group of textile enterprises”, which was adopted on
Lenin’s report by the Council of Labour and Defence on October
1, 1920. G. K. Korolyov’s report erroneously gave the date
as October 5.





[2]
The letter was sent out by Lenin after his talk with G. K.
Korolyov, Chairman of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia
Executive Committee, who had been despatched to Moscow in
connection with the food crisis in the gubernia, the stoppage of fuel
supply for shock textile mills and delays in wage payments to
workers. On November 15, 1920, Korolyov told Lenin about the
gubernia’s hardships and submitted a report listing the necessary
measures to overcome them.

On November 16, the C.P.C., on the report of a commission
appointed by Lenin, adopted a decision on the supply of money
and food to the workers of Ivanovo-Voznesensk. The following
day, November 17, the Council of Labour and Defence, on the
strength of a report by the same commission, adopted a resolution
on the supply of food and fuel to Ivanovo-Voznesensk. On the

16.XI.1920 

From Mosalsk Uyezd, Kaluga Gubernia.

1) At first requisition is said to have been in live cattle—
this caused extreme dissatisfaction among the peasants. It
was even said that they “were being robbed”.

Later (in X. 1920) the requisition is said to have been
switched from live cattle to meat (.13 pounds per cow, 26
pounds per pig, 7 pounds per sheep, etc.). The peasants
were highly satisfied with this change.

The requisition is now said to be again in live cattle:
there is again dissatisfaction and bitterness among the
peasants.

2) The former Baryatinsky estate (later owned by a
German, something like Schalart) in Silkovo Volost, probably
more than 1,000 dessiatines.
 

This has been taken over for a state farm, the land is
lying waste, millions are said to be taken from the treasury,
no more than 5 dessiatines ploughed up in 1920. Ten (out of
about 100) horses and 30–40 (out of 200) cows remain. No
one is working hard. The furniture has been pilfered, etc.

The peasants in the neighbourhood are very much in need
of land and are highly disgruntled at not being given
either meadow or land.

(Nikolai Semyonovich Bodyakov, Silkovo Volost, the
village of Filipkovo, Mosalsk Uyezd, Kaluga Gubernia.)

I request Comrades Bryukhanov and Sereda to order a
report and to let me have it, within two days, at the latest.

Can these needs be met? Or is there some
obstacle?[2]

Comrade Chicherin,

The news from Britain, especially from Krasin (and
extracts from the newspapers), and particularly the news
that America will at once join (a trade agreement between
Russia and Britain) raises the urgent and extremely
important issue of a trade agreement with
Britain.[2]

If it is a question of peace or
war,[1]

it should be tied in
with Batum and
Georgia.[3]

Then, on the question of debts, we should be absolutely
sure that we are not made to pay.

If there is a trade agreement who will have the right to
sign the final text? Krasin alone? or the Council of People’s
Commissars?

This question must be urgently worked out in all its
aspects.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

19/XI.
 

Notes
 

[1]
In the original the last three words are in English.—Ed.
 



[2]
The Soviet Government concluded a trade agreement with
Britain on March 16, 1921.





[3]
A reference to the occupation of Batum Ivy British troops planned
with the consent of the Georgian Menshevik government. On
November 16, 1920, People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs,
G. V. Chicherin, sent a Note to the representative of the
Georgian Menshevik government Makharadze and a radio telegram
to the British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, stating that the
Soviet Government regarded the occupation of Batum as an
attempt to start another war in the Caucasus and to create a direct
threat to the security of the Soviet Republic. He drew attention
to the possible dire consequences, the responsibility for which
would fall entirely on the invaders and their accomplices.

Request a report from the Supreme Economic Council
on the electrification of Yaropolets Volost (or Yaropolets
District), Volokolamsk Uyezd, Moscow
Gubernia.[2]
 

Copper is the main thing.

Engineer Ringo, who is in charge of the Moscow
Gubernia Electrical Department, favours the starting of local
electrical fittings factories (for instance, Vishnyakov’s and
Shamshin’s in Moscow), with the raw materials,
incidentally, available at the warehouse in Raiovo (artillery depot
of Moscow Gubernia, nine versts away from Moscow:
millions of poods of copper brought together from various parts,
especially Poland, during the war).

(Find Out about Ringo)

(1) assist electrification

(2) public education

(3) flax growing.

Keep secret, and give me a reminder when Kirillin from
Yaropolets (Volokolamsk Uyezd) comes to see me.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a speech at a peasant meeting in the village of Yaropolets
on November 14, 1920, Lenin dealt with some aspects of
electrification in the area, improvement of public education and
industrial development. A general meeting of the Electrotechnical
Co-operative Society on November 18 was attended by
representatives from 14 villages of Volokolamsk Uyezd, Yaropolets
Volost. The meeting sent Lenin a letter requesting assistance: 1) in
obtaining the necessary resources and materials to electrify
Yaropolets Volost; 2) in assigning teachers to the area to improve
public education and 3) in developing flax growing.

The first document was written by Lenin on November 19 after
he had read the letter. That same day, he inquired about the
quantity of non-ferrous metals in stock at Myza-Raiovo (Central
Artillery Administration). The second document was written on
the reply to his inquiry which he received on November 20.





[2]
The report on the electrification of Yaropolets Volost,
Volokolamsk Uyezd, Moscow Gubernia, was received by Lenin on
November 29, 1920.

Written by Lenin in connection with §4 of the draft resolution
of the C.P.C. on the “Moscow Higher State Art and Technical
Studios”. Lenin’s proposal was adopted and §4 was approved
in the following wording: “Enrolled students shall be deemed
fulfilling their academic obligations under study control on the
strength of special rules which must be established by the Chief
Labour Committee together with the People’s Commissariat for
Education within the fortnight and submitted for approval to
the Council of People’s Commissars.”

Lenin made the following correction in the note to §3 of the
draft: instead of the words “in their preparatory year” he
inserted “in all years”. With Lenin’s amendment, the note read: “In
all years, the teaching of political science and the fundamentals
of the communist world outlook shall be obligatory.”

In this form, the C.P.C. resolution was approved on
December 18, 1920.

[1]
During the talk with Deputy People’s Commissar for the Affairs
of Nationalities, A. Z. Kamensky, Lenin drew attention to the
need to issue literature on the national question.

On November 26, 1920, Kamensky sent Lenin a letter,
informing him that the State Publishers were delaying the issue of a
prepared collection of Soviet government decisions on the
national question over a period of three years, and requested Lenin’s
personal intervention. The note published here was written by
Lenin on Kamensky’s letter.

Shortly after this, in December 1920, the State Publishers put
out the collection of the People’s Commissariat for the Affairs
of Nationalities, Politika Sovetskoi vlasti po natsionalnym dyelam
za tri goda. 1917—XI—1920 (The Policy of the Soviet Power on
National Affairs for Three Years. 1917-XI-1920).

Comrade Chicherin:

The underscored is absolutely
intolerable.[1] The People’s
Commissar is duty bound precisely to carry out the C.P.C.
decision winding up the Groman commission. You failed
to protest the decision in the C.C., the decision of 7.IX,
and are inventing some kind of “friction” (where? whose?
why talk of “friction”, when there is a mandatory decision?

    

You yourself are creating it). How the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs can hope to “get it going”
contrary to the Council of People’s Commissars is
inconceivable. This is chaos and disorganisation. You are the one
who is impeding the C.P.C. decisions, and that is absolutely
intolerable.

29/XI.
Lenin

[1]
A reference to the last paragraph in G. V. Chicherin’s dispatch
to L. B. Krasin of November 27, 1920, which said:
“Re-establishment of the Groman Commission by the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade and ourselves is being delayed by statistician
Popov who wants to take part. For some reason, the C.P.C. has
supported him. The friction continues. We hope soon to get
the commission going,” Lenin underscored the paragraph, drew
three lines in the margin and pat two exclamation and two

   

question marks (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee). The
letter in question was written by Lenin on the dispatch.

Comrade Lunacharsky:

Comrade Litkens and I had a detailed talk yesterday.
I find his and Comrade Solovyov’s drafts
artificial.[2]
Naturally, the C.C. will decide. My own preliminary
considerations are as follows:

1) Set up the office of Assistant People’s Commissar to
handle all the administrative side.

2) Turn the “organisational sector” into an
“organisational centre” (with a member of the collegium in charge).
This centre is to handle the administrative, organisational,
supply and other sides of all the sectors.

3) Eliminate
Glavprofobr[1]

,

merging it with the
secondary schools, provided: (α) general knowledge and political
subjects are extended in the secondary schools and (β) the
switch from trade and technical to polytechnical education
is, as far as possible, ensured.

4) Revive the “G.U.S.” (State Academic Council) and
regulate it as an organ for discussion of all scientific and
pedagogical matters.
 


[[ BOX: ]]


Composition=all members of the collegium + the
best specialists, even if bourgeois.

5) Set up the following sectors; (1) pre-school; (2) primary
school; (3) secondary school (=Glavprofobr); (4)
extramural (==Chief Committee for Political Education);
(5) higher school; (6) art.

6) Leave the art sector as a single one, appointing
“political commissars” from among the Communists to all
central and governing bodies in the sector.

Comrade Chutskayev


Commission for Abolishing Cash
Taxes[1]

More thought must be given to the conditions of the
transition epoch (and the relevant facts studied in greater
detail).

There is no doubt about switching from money to the
exchange of products without money.

To make the switch a success, there must be an exchange
of products (not exchange of commodities).

So long as we are unable to carry on the exchange of
commodities, i.e., to give the peasants industrial products,
the peasantry has to make do with the remnants of
commodity (and consequently of money) circulation, with a
Substitute for it.

It is economically wrong to abolish the substitute (money)
before the peasantry has been given that which eliminates
the need of a substitute.

This must be given very serious thought.

30/XI.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
of th

The question of abolishing cash taxes was discussed at sittings
he Council of People’s Commissars on November 3 and 30
and December 18, 1920. On November 3, the C.P.C. set up a
commission consisting of S. Y. Chutskayev (chairman), N. I.
Bukharin, N. N. Krestinsky, D. I. Kursky, S. P. Sereda, F. F.
Syromolotov and 0. Y. Schmidt; later M. F. Vladimirsky and
A. D. Tsyurupa were also included in the commission. On
November 30, the C.P.C. adopted the decision on direct taxes written
by Lenin (see present edition, Vol. 42, p. 230). On December 18,
the C.P.C. adopted, in principle, Chutskayev’s draft decree on
the abolition of cash taxes, and referred it to a commission
consisting of Chutskayev, Kursky and T. V. Sapronov, instructing
it to rework the draft on the strength of the directions which had
been given, and, in the event of a unanimous decision, to submit
the decree for Lenin’s signature and place it before the Presidium
of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. On February 3,
1921, the latter adopted a decision in principle, suspending the
collection of all existing taxes, both state and local. The
transition to the new financial policy in connection with the
introduction of NEP once again brought out the tax problem.

Comrade Amosov,

After you left last night, I was told that the All-Russia
Central Trade Union Council had adopted its
decision.[1]
My advice is to submit to it, and concentrate entirely on
thoughtful execution (swift, firm preparation for the
congress).

That is only a piece of advice.

However, if all of you still disagree, there remains one
way: appeal the All-Russia Central T.U.C. decision with the
Central Committee (the Politbureau or the Plenum).

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

passed by the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on December 7), and the agenda
of the congress and the rapporteurs. The congress was held in
Moscow from March 22 to 31, 1921. Lenin delivered a speech at

14.XII.1920 

Comrade Tsyurupa:

I have already had occasion to point out in the Council
of People’s Commissars that the organisation of work at
the Distribution Department of the Commissariat for Food
is not entirely satisfactory: they have failed to make a
serious estimate of how many rations we have and how
many persons are receiving under each ration.

They must be made to do this.

Of course, there must be no disruption of the special
purpose supply. The workers must come first.

Do you think it  possible to set up a commission inside
the Commissariat for Food to make improvements in
this respect? If there is a commission, give it such an
assignment. More workers (from the trade unions) who had
worked in the Commissariat for Food (or possibly from
among those workers who have some experience in food
supply work locally) should be recruited to the commission.

Show this letter to Comrade Krestinsky. If he gives his
own consent (and that of the other members of the
Politbureau) we shall make this a C.C. directive.

Yours,

Lenin

Dear Comrade Tsyurupa:

The Plenary Meeting decision is the result of long and
old dissatisfactions with
Svidersky.[1]

The workers’ statement and, what is important, its
support by the trade unions, was the last straw.

I personally could not help admitting that the workers’
desire was right and that its satisfaction was an absolute
political necessity.
 

I realise that you find this painful. But political interest
(and the Party decision) unquestionably calls for
subordination. You can very well make use of Svidersky otherwise
than as a member of the collegium. We must tackle this
business of getting more workers; I realise that, being
swamped with work, you have been unable to give all your
attention to the question of recruiting more workers. I
realise that, with all this work and your illness, you have
been unable to keep altogether in touch with the Party
political side either.

Is that so surprising?

Don’t let your nerves go. You should try to live down
the painful feeling. The C.C. decision must be accepted
and put through.

I can’t come: there is a meeting on.

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On December 8, 1920, a Plenary Meeting of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee decided to release A. I. Svidersky from his post
of member of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for
Food and to appoint A. B. Khalatov in his stead. Besides the
Plenary Meeting ordered the People’s Commissariat for Food to

   

take more vigorous steps to enlist workers to the running of all
the departments and to recruit, even more workers to the
Commissariat and at a faster rate.

Svidersky’s release was opposed by A. D. Tsyurupa, who
threatened to resign from his post of the People’s Commissar for
Food. At its sitting on December 9, 1920, the Plenary Meeting
reaffirmed its decision and rejected Tsyurupa’s resignation.

14.XII.1920 

Comrade Frumkin,

I am writing you about your exclusion (and Svidersky’s)
from the collegium. I believe that it was necessary to put
through the All-Russia Central Executive Committee’s
decision on such members in a pedantic manner—and that
is how the C.C. has
decided.[1] Political conditions demand
particular circumspection in this matter, as in the matter
of recruiting workers. I hope you will fully understand that
the political considerations, which the C.C. has approved,
must not and cannot in any sense be interpreted as
signifying a lack of personal confidence, an underestimation of
personal qualities, etc. (even if there were gossipy attempts
to do so).

The new composition of the collegium without yourself
must be accepted as a political necessity, and the mistrust

    

and suspicion (of the unwillingness to “recruit workers”,
unwillingness to have more democracy, etc.) should be
dispelled by hard work (I personally am sure that you and
Svidersky will do this quite easily, and that this will come
about of itself through a continuation of your work). The
whole point is to have your work, without the official high
rank (member of the collegium), refute all the slanders, all
the apprehensions of the workers and the trade unions. I
repeat I am sure that you and Svidersky will understand
this and will easily do it, There and there alone lies the
gist of the matter.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

A reference to the resolution on the food question adopted by
the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, on N. P.
Bryukhanov’s report, on September 26, 1920. Its point 12 said: “In
order to make the work of the governing centre of the People’s
Commissariat for Food more flexible, the Council of People’s
Commissars is to be authorised to limit the Collegium of the
People’s Commissariat for Food to seven members (the People’s
Commissar and his deputy included), instructing the People’s
Commissariat for Food to give a precise definition to the functions
and responsibilities of each” (Postanovleniya i rezolutsii sessii
VTsIK sedmogo sozyva =

[Decisions and Resolutions of the Seventh
All-Russia Central Executive Committee Session], Moscow,
1920, p. 77).

A Plenary Meeting of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on
December 9, 1920, adopted a decision to reduce the number of
members of the Commissariat’s Collegium to seven, including
the People’s Commissar, in accordance with the resolution of
the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. On December 14,
the C.P.C. approved the new Collegium: People’s Commissar
A. D. Tsyurupa, Deputy People’s Commissar N. P. Bryukhanov
and members I. S. Lobachev, N. Osinsky, A. P. Smirnov,
A. B. Khalatov, L. M. Khinchuk.

14/XII. 

Comrade Chicherin,

Yesterday Ter-Gabrielyan came to see me and he also
spoke of the terrible danger of a pogrom.

(1) 600,000 Armenian refugees are said to be in danger
of losing their lives.

(2) Without Kars, Baku is said to be
threatened.[1]

I think we should separate No. (1) from No. (2) and do
everything to help in No. (1).

What is your opinion? and what are you doing on
No. (1)?

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On December 13, 1920, Lenin received S. M. Ter-Gabrielyan,
who had been sent to Moscow by the Revolutionary Committee
of Armenia to report to Lenin on the political and economic
situation in Armenia.

As a result of the reckless policy of the Dashnaks, who had
started a war against Turkey in late September 1920—with the
approval of the Entente—the Turkish army occupied the towns
of Sarykamysh, Kara, Alexandropol and others. On the occupied
territory, the Turkish troops massacred great numbers of
Armenians. Many Armenians died from starvation and epidemics, and
thousands of families fled from their homes, seeking refuge in
other parts of Armenia.

The Dashnak government of Armenia rejected the R.S.F.S.R.’s
mediation and preferred to sign the enslaving Alexandropol
Treaty on December 2, 1920, under which Armenia was declared
a Turkish protectorate. But the treaty did not enter into force,
because the Dashnak government was overthrown on November
29, 1920, and the Soviet power was proclaimed in Armenia. On
March 16, 1921, the R.S.F.S.R. and Turkey signed a treaty which
virtually nullified the Alexandropol Treaty. The question of

   

the Soviet-Turkish border in the Caucasus was fin illy settled
with the signing of the Kars Treaty on October 13, 1921.

The good thing in the pamphlet is the author’s strength
of revolutionary convictions and his unbending faith in the
revolution. His remarks about the party as it should be are
good. His criticism of Social-Democrats is good.

But a glaring shortcoming is the total absence of any
facts. This makes the pamphlet weak. I should say that of
the 55 pages 40 ought to be filled with precise facts (the
history of the Social-Democratic Party and the revolution,
and also of the counter-revolution in Hungary), giving a
summary of the facts and leaving 15 pages for evaluation.

Unless it is rewritten in this way, the pamphlet is
extremely weak and not fit for use.

Comrade Gorbunov:

Will you contact Semashko and M. N. Pokrovsky. This
is a scandalous business. My reply should be drafted by
agreement with both and sent to

2/1.1921. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Lenin’s draft reply to a letter from the Central
Committee of the Board of the Swedish Red Cross No. 2371 of
November 9, 1920, requesting that I. P. Pavlov should be given
permission to “go to Sweden where he will have the
possibility of conducting his great research in a calm and favourable
atmosphere”, and stating that “the idea arose in the scientific
circles of the Nobel Prize Institute and was caught up by the
Swedish Red Cross; Prof. Pavlov knows nothing about it”
(Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR =

[Documents of U.S.S.R. Foreign
Policy], Vol. III, Moscow, 1959, p. 682).


Lenin put a very high value on Pavlov’s scientific

   

achievements and treated him with very great attention and concern.
On January 24, 1921, the C.P.C. adopted the decree written by
Lenin “Concerning the Conditions Ensuring the Research Work
of Academician I. P. Pavlov and His Associates” (present
edition, Vol. 32, p. 69). Also see this volume, Document 40.

Comrade Chicherin:

I think, even 30 is too much. After all, Joffe promised
not to give any gold but only concessions.

I think we should not give them even
3 0.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter to Lenin of January 3, 1921,
informing him about the negotiations between A. A. Joffe,
Chairman of the Russian-Ukrainian delegation, and Jan Dombski,
Chairman of a delegation from the bourgeois Polish Republic,
on the conclusion of a peace treaty between Russia and the
Ukraine, on the one hand, and Poland, on the other. Dombski
demanded that the Soviet Republic should compensate Poland
for military expenditures running to 73 million gold rubles,
while Joffe agreed to only 30 million.

The peace treaty concluded on March 18, 1921, stated that
both sides waived any compensation for their military
expenditures and losses caused by the war.

Comrade Chicherin:

Of course, it is all right in principle. But is it worth
while? Hardly. It comes to nothing in practice. It is not
worth while “offending” Béla Kun and the other comrades
for nothing. We shall probably gain by only exchanging
the hostages for the People’s
Commissars.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter concerning the
forthcoming talks with Horthy’s Hungarian government over the
exchange of People’s Commissars of the Hungarian Soviet
Republic, whom, it had arrested, for hostages in Soviet Russia.
Chicherin said that these talks could become more general, and that
the Hungarian Communists had earlier expressed dissatisfaction
over the Soviet Government’s agreement with the reactionary
Horthy government on the repatriation of prisoners of war.
Chicherin wrote: “... I should like to know the attitude you take,
in principle, on whether it is admissible for us to conduct
political negotiations with reactionary governments, when the issue is
our external security” (Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Gorbunov:

All of this is from the village of Modenovo (p.t.o.).
Examine this and help them. They are asking for a
reduction of their surplus-products deliveries (p.t.o.). Inquire at
the People’s Commissariat for Food and let me
know.[2]


{

The comrade with whom I spoke is a member
of the Volost Labour Committee,

Pyotr
Kozlov[1]


Modenovo

The village of Modenovo, Bogorodsk Volost, Vereya Uyezd,
Moscow Gubernia.

They have fulfilled these surplus-products deliveries:

hay

straw

200—200

spring straw

poultry

eggs

meat

Request: reduce the obligatory deliveries of hay and corn
(fearful of detachments).
 

Notes
 

[1]
Lenin wrote the whole note on the envelope of the letter he
received. The text that follows is written on the other side of the
envelope.—Ed.
 



[2]
At the invitation of peasants from the village of Modenovo,
Bogorodsk Volost, Vereya Uyezd, Moscow Gubernia, Lenin gave
a report on the current situation at a meeting of the inhabitants
of the villages of Modenovo, Shalikovo and others, on December
15, 1920. At their request, Lenin signed a record of the minutes.
When the peasants complained about their excessive quotas in
the delivery of surplus corn and hay, Lenin said that he was
unable to decide the matter on the spot and asked them to send
a representative to Moscow.

In fulfilment, of an assignment from Lenin, N. P. Gorbunov
got the actual condition of the peasants in the village of
Modenovo thoroughly verified, and on March 5, 1921, their deliveries
were cancelled. Before this decision had been taken, a general
meeting of Modenovo peasants on January 29, 1921, discussed
the matter of surplus deliveries and decided that the quotas
could not be met in full. They added: “Realising the critical state
of the country, however, we have decided to help with food and
fodder, reducing our own stocks to the bare minimum. In addition

   

to our earlier fulfilled quotas, we have decided to add 3 poods
of rye, 10 poods of oats, 31 poods of potatoes and 24 poods of
hay” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Gorbunov:   

It is necessary 

1) to have this translated into (good) German,

2) find out (from Semashko and M. N. Pokrovsky or
through them) whether we could add 

that Pavlov has not applied to leave (is it true that he
would not like to go?),

that he has been given the specified privileges.

Since my letter may be published, the addition of this
is highly desirable.

Yours,

Lenin

P.S. Please return all these documents to me.

at once and to speed up this matter in every possible way,
taking it to the end, to its completion. Please inform me of
any delay.

For my part, I enclose an engineer’s estimate (at the
Gorki state farm) of what is required.

If this is not available at the Moscow Gubernia Economic
Council (the Electrical Department), send them a copy.

We should check up on whether their request is  not
excessive.[1]

1921. Because the matter of reorganising the People’s
Commissariat for Education had been dealt with in general terms, Lenin
ordered the implementation of its resolutions to be suspended.
On January 26, the matter was discussed by a Plenary Meeting
of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee which set up a special
commission headed by Lenin. For the reorganisation of the People’s
Commissariat for Education see this volume, Documents 19 and
68; present, edition, Vol. 32, pp. 120–22, 123–32; Vol. 35,

Comrade Gorbunov,

1) Concerning your note on the secretariat. Let’s discuss
it when we meet. Don’t start for the time being.

2) I enclose Shklovskaya’s letter. Request: read and
telephone the C.C. (secretaries) and the People’s

    

Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, saying that / ask them to meet her
request. I know the family, they will not survive in Russia
at
present.[2]

3) Concerning the electric lighting at
Gorki[1]

:

I have also
received an application from the village of Siyanovo (has
it been passed on to you?). Let the person concerned have
a look at it, although it is far. Are you speeding up the
whole business?

4) Please find out, without taking any steps until we
meet, whether anything is being done anywhere (C.C.,
Telegraph Agency of Russia, People’s Commissariats, etc.)

α) regular press cuttings,

β) pasting up of cuttings for reference system.

If something is being done, have a look and tell me how.

If not, let us discuss how to start this business when
we meet.

Regards,

Lenin

In a letter to Lenin of January 14, 1921, Dvosya Shklovskaya       

(G. L. Shklovsky’s wife) wrote that since their return to Russia    

from exile abroad in October 1920, she herself and her children     

especially were constantly unwell and could not adapt to local      

conditions. She asked Lenin for help in having Shklovsky sent       

to work abroad to enable his family to go with him.

On her letter, Lenin wrote: “Comrade Gorbunov. This is a                    

fair request; I earnestly ask you to meet it In Russia, this family          

will not survive. Lenin. Please make a note of the address. Send    

on to Krestinsky” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of               

Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee). On the                  

question of Shklovsky’s departure for abroad, see this volume,

Dear D. Z.:

I quite understand you. When I spoke to your husband, I
told him right away: wouldn’t it be better to go abroad?
For I clearly saw that you would not be able to manage here
(especially in Moscow). I was very much surprised that he
refused to recognise this obvious fact.

I am not in Moscow at
present.[3] I have written to
Gorbunov (a very good man), asking him on my behalf to talk
both with the C.C. and the People’s Commissariat for

    

Foreign Affairs about meeting your
request.[2]

If need be,
speak to Gorbunov (I enclose his telephone number) without
hesitation: he is a very good man.

Best regards to the whole family, the children
especially.

Lenin

Comrade N. P. Gorbunov:

Please give a closer reading to Comrade Eiduk’s
material[1] and have a talk with him, 

to try to formulate the practical proposals

together with him.

Tell Comrade Eiduk that I am extremely interested in
this most important matter, and very much regret that I
am unable just now to take it up personally.

But once the practical proposals are there, I shall tackle
it.

2) The Narrow Council business as designated.

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes

A reference to the memorandum and report on the state of and
prospects for fuel supply in the Soviet Republic submitted by
A. V. Eiduk, a special representative of the Council of Labour
and Defence for central fuel administrations. On January 20,

   

1921, N. P. Gorbunov and Eiduk formulated practical
proposals on this question. On January 28, the C.L.D. set up a
plenipotentiary commission on fuel, headed by V. A. Avanesov, and
on January 31, following an examination of Eiduk’s report about
the disastrous state of the railways, the C.L.D. included him in
the commission as well, adopting a decision on fuel on February 2.

I request the Editorial Board to publish Rudzutak’s
theses, which were adopted by the Fifth All-Russia Trade
Union Conference held from November 2 to 6, 1920; they

    

are extremely necessary as material for discussion. I also
append material on the debate which has started in Party
circles concerning the origin of these theses.

N. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At a joint sitting of R.C.P.(B.) members who were delegates            

to the Eighth Congress of Soviets, members of the All-Russia           

Central T.U.C. and the Moscow Gubernia T.U.C. on December 30,          

1920, a dispute arose over whether Y. E. Rudzutak was the              

author of the theses on “The Production Tasks of the Trade            

Unions”. In this context, Lenin requested the All-Russia Central      

T.U.C. to provide documentary evidence on the origin of the            

theses. He was given an extract from the minutes under No. 44          

of the sitting of the Presidium of the All-Russia Central T.U.C.       

of November 1, and a covering memo by S. A. Lozovsky. Lenin            

sent the material collected, together with Rudzutak’s theses,          

to the Pravda Editorial Board and these were published on    

January 21, 1921, with Lenin’s covering letter.

20.I.1921 

Dear Comrades:

From the comrades you have sent, Lavrik, Malikov and
Bykov, I learned with great satisfaction how you organised
the dispatch of a gift to the working people of the city of
Moscow. In accordance with the mandate of your general
meeting, I received from your delegates Invoice No. 243
covering the cargo you dispatched: 2,002 poods of wheat,
1,869 poods 29 pounds of barley and 35 poods of flour, and
also a detailed written report about how you carried out
the procurement of salt by doing free overtime work, about
your voluntary stints without pay on holidays in general,
and about your cultural and educational work.

Instructions have been issued to have the cargo, delayed
en route through no fault of the comrades you have sent,
delivered to the People’s Commissariat for Food, and all
the foodstuffs you have sent will be handed over to the
workers of the city of Moscow.

I advise you to give more attention to cultural and
educational work and the schools. I hope that through a
concerted effort you will succeed in eliminating all the
difficulties which arise.

I was especially interested in the communist farming
you have introduced. One of the most important tasks
now facing the Republic is the development and boosting

    

of agriculture. I was happy to hear your report that this
year you will be able to develop 2,200 dessiatines as
ploughland, and 25 dessiatines as vegetable garden. You must
see to it that your agriculture is organised on the right
lines, as agronomic science requires, and I advise you to
get a knowledgeable agronomist for that
purpose.[1]


My special request to you is that your work in the
commune should be so organised as to help peasants in the
vicinity and maintain the best relations with them. Without
this and without business-like practical economic success
I have little faith in the communes, and am even somewhat
apprehensive of them.

I send you all my comradely greetings.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

I am very sorry that I was unable to see them personally
and had to ask Comrade N. P. Gorbunov to do so.

Comrade Gorbunov:

A decision was adopted today to have you see to the
execution of C.P.C.
decisions.[1]

This business must be organised on the correct lines:
you must always have a file or list of decisions which have
not been carried out or require constant supervision (over
execution).

Comrade Gorbunov to establish thorough supervision over the
fulfilment of C.P.C. decisions, especially those not specifying dates

appointment as Chairman of the Supreme Council for
Transportation (C.P.C. decision of January 25), the writer was resigning
as deputy chairman of the Council.

On February 5, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee discussed the question of the Supreme Council
for Transportation and decided to accept Larin’s resignation,
authorising Rykov to implement the decision in the most
appropriate form, and putting the Council’s administration entirely
in the hands of Fomin.

The Sormovo Works is making a caterpillar crane for
Gidrotorf, but this is being done much too slowly. In view
of the need to test the crane in the coming summer season,
I request that every effort be made to have the crane all
ready in April to make its delivery possible to
Electroperedacha Station in early May for all-round trials, so that,

    

once all the necessary improvements are ascertained, the
mass production of cranes could be started on this
model.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin received detailed fortnightly reports on the work on a      

caterpillar peat crane at the Sormovo Works. On June 24, 1921,    

he was informed that the assembly was in its final stages and     

that the crane would be tested in the latter half of July.

Comrade Gorbunov:

I have just spoken to you on the telephone about this
draft. Request: speed up all this business, and all the
many drafts, so as to have the lot go to the Narrow C.P.C.,
say, on
Saturday.[1]

27.I.1921. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On January 27, 1921, Lenin received Maxim Gorky and a
delegation of the Joint Council of Scientific Institutions and Higher
Schools of Petrograd, consisting of Academician S. F.
Oldenburg, permanent secretary of the Academy of Sciences of Russia;
Academician V. A. Steklov, Vice-President of the Academy, and
Prof. V. N. Tonkov, President of the Military Medical Academy.
During their talk, they handed in a draft decree on ensuring
scientific research work in the Republic. Together with Lenin’s
note written on the draft it was sent on to N. P. Gorbunov. On
February 1, 1921, the C.P.C. discussed the draft decree,
submitted by the Narrow C.P.C., on the means required to normalise
the work of educational research and technical research
institutions in the R.S.F.S.R.

The estate is said to comprise about 30 dessiatines of
ploughland, and 130 of forest. The Saratov Gubernia
Executive Committee is said to be agreeable. I think this should
be placed before the Narrow Council right away, and an
inquiry and on-the-spot study appointed through the
Narrow
Council.[1]

27.I.1921. Lenin

Written on a letter from the Academy of Sciences of Russia to       

the C.P.C. of January 21, 1921, petitioning the nationalisation     

and transfer to the Academy of a former estate of Academician       

A. A. Shakhmatov, called Gubanovka-Shakhmatovka (Saratov           

Gubernia), for use as a rest home for scientists. On January 31,    

1921, the Narrow C.P.C. passed a decision to send an inquiry        

on the matter to the Saratov Gubernia Executive Committee.

31.I.1921 

Comrade Kruchinsky:

I have received your reports on the People’s
Commissariat for
Agriculture.[2] I have read them and reported to the
C.C. members.

By appointing Osinsky, we, the Central Committee, have
done what we could. Osinsky saw me yesterday and told
me that he was getting a number of local comrades, peasants,
to join in the work.

Why are you dissatisfied with Osinsky? The whole R.C.P.
group of the Eighth Congress of Soviets had a high opinion
of him over the seed campaign.

Which Communist workers are dissatisfied with the work
and why?

Please let me have concrete instructions and proposals.
We in the C.C. believe that we have done everything
possible for the time being; we are waiting to see the results
of the work of the new Collegium of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture and think that they will be good.

With communist greetings,


N. Lenin

We should make inquiries and find out whether anything

Written on a letter from G. Kotlyarov, a representative of the      

miners, to Lenin of January 24, 1921, suggesting that the steel     

cables on lifts in Moscow dwelling houses should be dismantled      

and handed over for use in mines, where mechanisms were idle        

because of a cable shortage. See also this volume, Document 169.

1/II–1921. 

Comrade Frumkin:

We have been receiving (from inside and outside) more
and more information about the absolutely intolerable
“independence” of the Ukraine in matters of the People’s
Commissariat for Food.

You must dig right down to the whole truth, which is
obviously being concealed from us (to some extent
probably unwittingly, by conniving at those whose concealment
is deliberate). This is a serious matter, and we shall not
let it go at that; we shall find out the whole truth.

We shall fully expose the role of Peshekhonov (worse
than any whiteguard), who had clearly been fooling the
Ukrainian C.C. (we do not yet know through whom he had
done that, but we shall find out).

But just now, and above all, you are fully responsible
for finding out and getting at all the facts, and must see to
it that you are not duped by Peshekhonov and those who
have been deceived by the
Peshekhonovs.[2]

Awaiting your reply,


With communist greetings,


Lenin

[2]

A. V. Peshekhonov, one-time Minister for Food in the
bourgeois Provisional Government, worked at the Central Statistical
Bureau of the Ukraine in 1921. On January 20, 1922, the
Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee decided to dismiss
him from his job. In July 1922, Peshekhonov was arrested for
participation in the counter-revolutionary League of Regeneration
and deported.

Comrade Ryazanov:

Do you at the library have a collection of all the letters
of Marx and Engels from the newspapers? from separate
magazines?

For example, about materialism in Leipzieger
Volkszeitung, 1894?

The one from Vorwärts about
Beesley[1]

?

(it may not be
spelled quite that way: English professor, Comtist, who
knew Marx?)

And similar other things.

Is there a catalogue of all the letters of Marx and Engels?

Could I have it to go over for about a week, i.e., the
catalogue?

Yours,

Lenin

Comrade Ryazanov:

I have a great request:


Return   the
books.[1]

|||||||

1) Do you, by any chance, know where
the underscored passages in Engels’s letters
come from?

2) Has this ever been published in full and where?

3) If it has, can we find and get it?

4) Could we buy the letters of Marx and Engels, or
photographs of them, from Scheidemann & Co. (you know,
this dirty lot will sell anything)?
 

5) Is there any hope of our collecting in Moscow
everything published by Marx and Engels?

6) Is there a catalogue of everything already collected
here?

7) Are we collecting the letters of Marx and Engels, (or
copies of them) or is that impossible?

With communist greetings,

Comrade Goikhbarg:

About the reports by the People’s Commissars, you (the
Narrow Council) should, pay particular attention to the
execution of the most important
decisions.[1]

The burning question today is flats in Moscow. Appoint
check-ups, with reports in the Narrow Council twice a week:
how many houses, flats, rooms have been given (you will
recall that 10 houses have to be given).

Also check up on the allocation.

The population of Moscow is being inflated by the
growing staffs. This should be verified; perhaps, we should adopt
a decision.

A People’s Commissariat increasing the number of its
staffs without the permission of the Narrow Council should
be subjected to various penalties (prohibition to increase
even by one person).

Draw up a list of the People’s Commissariats which are
to reduce the number of their staffs weekly (People’s
Commissariat for Defence, the Supreme Economic Council, the
People’s Commissariat for Railways and certain others).

    

The rest may increase their staffs only with the permission
of the Narrow Council.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On February 1, 1921, the C.P.C. adopted a decision authorising     

the Narrow C.P.C. to verify execution by People’s Commissariats    

of decisions and assignments from the C.L.D. and the C.P.C.,       

bringing to the notice of the C.P.C. the question of execution     

of decisions having fundamental importance.

Comrade Mantsev:

Outrageous things are happening in the Ukraine.

The Politbureau directive (to have Peshekhonov and
the Peshekhonovites removed from Kharkov) is being foiled.

Some of the Ukrainian C.C. members are allowing
themselves to be deceived by Peshekhonov and the
Peshekhonovites.

That is clear. We too shall not allow ourselves to be
fooled any longer.

I authorise you, on your personal responsibility (on
condition of secret and direct and regular communication
with the Politbureau in Moscow) to:

(1) keep Peshekhonov under full observation;

(2) send the results here;

(3) similarly with all the other Peshekhonovites, a list
of them;

(4) secure Peshekhonov’s immediate resignation and his
dispatch to Moscow.

The Ukrainian C.C. is in complete disarray. Let’s see
if you can do this properly.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

6.II.1921 

Comrade Sklyansky:

Let me have the telegram from the Saratov Gubernia
military commissar, the “reply” to which from the
Commander-in-Chief you sent me today.

The reply is stupid and here and there illiterate.

It is a bureaucratic handout, instead of a business-like
approach: banditry must be wiped out, instead of being
formally written about.

Let them give me, twice a week, brief, very brief results
of the fight against banditry.

Also bring home to the field staff that they should work,
instead of writing formal notes.

Who is this “field staff military commissar” Ilyushin,
what is his record?

The C.C. is inclined to permit the 11th Army to give
active support to the uprising in Georgia and to occupy
Tiflis, provided international rules are observed and all
members of the 11th Army R.M.C. after a serious
examination of all the data, vouch for
success.[3] We warn that we
have been left without grain because of transport, and
will therefore not give a single train or a single car. We
are forced to carry only grain and oil from the Caucasus. We
demand an immediate reply by direct wire signed by all
the 11th Army R.M.C. members and also by Smilga,
Gittis, Trifonov and Frumkin. Until our reply to the
telegrams from all these persons, do nothing
drastic.[1]


14.II.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Lenin then added the following: “On behalf of the C.C.,
Krestinsky.” At the bottom of the telegram Lenin added this note,
apparently addressed to the secretary: “No, better keep this
top-secret for 2–3 months.”—Ed.
 



[2]
The text of the telegram proposed by Lenin was approved by
the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on
February 14, 1921.





[3]
The working people’s armed uprising, led by the Georgian
Bolsheviks, against the Menshevik government of Georgia began on
the night of February 11, 1921. At the request of the Georgian
working people, Soviet Russia’s Government ordered units of
the 11th Army to support the insurgents. Relying on the support
of those units, the workers and peasants of Georgia fought a heroic
struggle and routed the Menshevik forces, liberating Tiflis, the
capital of Georgia, on February 25, and proclaiming Georgia a
Soviet Socialist Republic. See this volume, Documents 66 and
86.

The C.C. regards the operations of the 11th Army R.M.C.
as local protection for insurgents in the neutral zone against
their imminent destruction by the
whiteguards.[3] Take
account of this political character of your operation in

    

all your public statements. Of course, we expect the 11th
Army R.M.C. to take swift and vigorous action, not
stopping short of the capture of Tiflis, if, for military
considerations, this should be necessary for the actual defence of
the neutral zone against a fresh attack. We expect you to
reckon most seriously with our warnings. Inform us
daily.[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
Lenin then wrote: “On behalf of the C.C., Krestinsky.”—Ed.
 



[2]
The text of the telegram proposed by Lenin was approved by
the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on
February 15, 1921.





[3]
Reciprocal territorial claims over Borchalo and a part of
Akhalkalaki uyezds, Tiflis Gubernia, resulted in a war between
Menshevik Georgia and Dashnak Armenia in December 1918. After
“peaceful mediation” by the British command, which pursued
its own colonialist aims, military operations were stopped, the
northern part of Borchalo Uyezd going to Georgia, the southern,
to Armenia, and the central—Lori district—was declared a
neutral zone with a mixed Georgian-Armenian local administration
subordinate to the Entente military command. In November
1920, in view of the war between Dashnak Armenia and Turkey,
the neutral zone was occupied, with the Entente’s consent, by
the troops of Menshevik Georgia. The working population of the
neutral zone, which was being subjected to savage plunder and
violence, staged an armed uprising under the leadership of the
Communists against the oppressors on the night of February 11,
1921. It was the start of a general victorious uprising by the
working people of Georgia against the Menshevik regime.

Litkens is proposing to the Organising Bureau a list
of candidates for the Academic Centre (of the People’s
Commissariat for
Education).[1] I request that it be referred
to the Politbureau.

15/II.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Academic Centre, or the centre for general theoretical and
programme direction, was one of the ’organs of the People’s
Commissariat for Education. On the strength of the “Statute of the
People’s Commissariat for Education”, approved by the C.P.C.
on February 11, 1921, the Academic Centre was to consist of a
scientific section (State Scientific Council) with three
subsections–scientific-political, scientific-technical and
scientific-pedagogical—and an arts section (Chief Arts Committee) with
five subsections: literature, theatre, music, figurative arts and the
cinema. In addition, the Central Archives Board and the Central
Museum Board were part of the Academic Centre.

I have not seen the article, but relying on Kamenev
(that he would not have, recommended anything harmful)
I cast my vote in favour of publishing it tomorrow.

Lenin

2

In that case, we should require 

1) the reservation that the author or authors have
written it as private writers and not as persons in office;

2) the reservation: the article is offered for discussion.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote these two notes at a sitting of the Politbureau of
the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee. The first was written in reply
to Krestinsky’s note saying that the Pravda Editorial Board had
received an article on the advantages of the tax in kind over the
surplus-food requisitioning. L. B. Kamenev had passed on the
article to Krestinsky requesting that it should be printed without
fail on February 17. N. L. Meshcheryakov, a member of the
Pravda collegium, had doubts about the need for its urgent
publication. Krestinsky wrote to say that he was essentially in
agreement with Meshcheryakov.

The second note was in reply to Krestinsky’s communication
that he was doubtful about the official character of the article,
which was being presented almost on behalf of the Moscow
Soviet, because the authors had signed: “Moscow Gubernia Food
Commissar Sorokin and Head of Moscow Gubernia Agricultural
Department Rogov.” On February 16, the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee passed a decision permitting the
publication of the article.

The article entitled “Surplus Appropriation or Tax” signed
by P. Sorokin and M. Rogov, was carried by way of discussion
in Pravda. Nos. 35 and 43 on February 17 and 26, 1921. It was
mentioned by Lenin in his speech at the Plenary Meeting of the
Moscow Soviet of Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies on
February 28, 1921 (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 156).

Comrade Muralov:

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky is highly delighted with Yesin,
worker and Communist, whom he says you know as well. In

    

the words of Krzhizhanovsky this is an outstanding worker,
an electrician, and extremely useful (turned out to be
useful in the work of the State Commission for the
Electrification of Russia). So Krzhizhanovsky strongly recommends
him for membership of the General Planning Commission
of the Council of Labour and Defence.

I think this Commission should, as a general rule,
consist of specialists, a worker, by way of exception.

I have told Osinsky as much and should like to know
your opinion. I earnestly request you to send me (with the
same messenger), in a few lines, your detailed opinion of
Yesin, his record, his efficiency,
etc.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On February 18, 1921, N. I. Muralov, in a positive reference           

about V. Z. Yesin, wrote: “I believe it to be highly useful to    

appoint him to a commission under the C.L.D.” (Central Party          

Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.          

Central Committee).

On Lenin’s proposal, Yesin was approved a member of the           

C.L.D.’s General Planning Commission (see Lenin Miscellany    

XX, p. 24).

I highly recommend to you the bearer of this, Comrade

Revolution as a most loyal Finnish Bolshevik. He is now a
member of the C.C. of Finland’s Communist Party.

He must personally speak to you on a number of the most
secret matters. Please, trust him fully and give him every
possible assistance.

Comrade Chicherin:

I am not soliciting any high posts for Comrade
Shklovsky. You know him by his work at the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

But I ask you to speed up his departure abroad, because
his wife fears that the children will not survive here. I
have known the whole family since our stay abroad, and
believe these fears to be weighty. This family cannot stand
our conditions. They must be sent abroad.

With communist greetings,

23.II.1921

In view of the reports sent in to the Central Oil
Administration on the question of the flooding of oil wells and the
consequent threat of disaster, please let me have today, if
possible, any material you may have at hand (books,

    

magazines, reports, etc.) on foreign laws or local regulations
penalising oil industrialists for leaving wells uncovered,
failing to provide cementation, its faulty application, etc.

Let me have either the laws themselves, or, if these are
not immediately available, references to the
corresponding books or magazine articles or handbooks, so that I
could get them from the library.

Please reply by telephone today.

To Rakovsky, coded

Rakovsky, Kharkov. Re: Your No. 672

In view of the extremely grave food supply situation
at the centre, I propose: three-quarters to be brought down
here, one-quarter left for the cities and workers of the
Ukraine; the peasants must be rewarded at any cost, within
the bounds of possibility, and if we have nothing, then
by making purchases abroad for gold or oil. If you disagree
with this, make another concession to the peasants, but
bear in mind that the food crisis over here is desperate and
downright
dangerous.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes

At the top Lenin wrote and then crossed out: “Comrade

The telegram was sent on February 25, 1921, in reply to Kh. G.    

Rakovsky’s telegram No. 672 of February 22, 1921, informing       

Lenin about the existence in the Ukraine of food stocks           

which he proposed should be used mainly for local needs, and a    

part of them for commodity exchange with other countries in       

return for agricultural machinery and implements for the    

Ukraine, and requested Lenin’s opinion on this question.

Comrade Semashko

Nikolai Alexandrovich:

I now have with me Comrade Ivan Afanasyevich
Chekunov, a very interesting toiling peasant, who is propagating
communist principles in his own
way.[1]
 

He has lost his spectacles and paid 15,000 rubles for
the trash! Could you help him to get good spectacles?

I earnestly request you to help and ask your secretary
to let me know whether you have managed to do so.

Yours,

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
After his talk with I. A. Chekunov, Lenin made the following
inscription opposite Chekunov’s name in the margin of the
visitors’ register: “This old man has a good head, but is not in the
Party because of his religious convictions” (Ogonyok No. 29,
July 15, 1962).

Comrade Tsyurupa:

Your figures show the stocks on 1.II to be 40.3 food +
5.4
groats==45.7.[1]

The probable figure for 1.III is about 48.

By 1.IV, probably, not less than 50.

From 1.IV to 1.IX is five months. 50 : 5==10.

This rough estimate shows that for Russia, for the
R.S.F.S.R. (without the Ukraine), it is quite possible to
abolish the surplus-requisition from 15.III or l.IV, and
try out the new regime until 1.IX or 15.VIII.

What do you think?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on the strength of A. D. Tsyurupa’s report on the grain
balances as of February 1, 1921, saying that there were 40.3
million poods of food grain and 5.4 million poods of groats in
European Russia, Siberia and the Caucasus.

1.III.1921

Comrade Osinsky:

Yesterday I saw Ivan Afanasyevich Chekunov. It turned
out that he had already been to see me in 1919 on the
question of a congress of toiling peasants. Now he says: it is
better to start with regional ones.
 

He Sympathises with the Communists, but will not join
the Party, because he goes to church and is a Christian
(he says he rejects the ritual but is a believer).

He has been improving his farm. He has toured
Nizhni-Novgorod and Simbirsk gubernias. He says the peasants have
lost confidence in the Soviet power. I asked him whether
we could right things with a tax? He thinks we could. In
his own uyezd, he has succeeded, with the help of the
workers, to substitute a good Soviet authority for the
bad one.

That is the kind of people we must do our utmost to hold
on to, in order to restore the confidence of the peasant mass.
This is the main political task and one which brooks no
delay. My earnest request: see that the “apparatus”
standpoint does not run away with you, and do not worry too
much over it. Devote more attention to the political
attitude towards the peasantry.

I think we must “capture” Chekunov immediately, i.e.,
involve him in our activity. How are we to do this? This
needs thinking about. Perhaps we should set up right away
(rather start) a “toiling peasant council” or a “non-Party
peasant council” (perhaps, the latter name is more guarded
for keeping out those whom Chekunov calls the “hissers”,
i.e., the downright kulaks and enemies of the Soviet power).
Chekunov should be appointed right away as the authorised
representative of the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture
to organise (or prepare) such an institution. He should be
urgently sent to Simbirsk Gubernia (we need an adviser
and a mediator from a gubernia with surplus grain, better
two mediators) and be given this assignment: to bring us
over here from Simbirsk Gubernia (where he knows various
people) a non-Party Russian peasant, a man advanced in
years and a farmer, who favours the toiling peasants and
the workers, and is not a “hisser”. Another one must also
be found. Three would be best: Chekunov+the man from
Simbirsk+another from a gubernia not growing grain. This
trio of “old men” (it would be good for all of them to be
both non-Party men and Christians) we will at once turn
either into non-voting members of the collegium, or into
the nucleus of a “non-Party peasant council”, or a similar
corporation.
 

This must be done speedily, at once (he intends to leave
the day after tomorrow).

Strike while the iron’s hot. Let me have your reply.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Trotsky:

I am sending this for your
information.[1] These are very
interesting things. I think the Ukrainian Communists are
wrong. The conclusion to be drawn from the facts is not
against a tax, but for intensified military measures for the
total annihilation of Makhno, etc.

Lenin
 

Notes

A reference to a telegram received by the People’s Commissariat      

for Food on March 2, 1921, reporting great difficulties in the       

work of the Ukraine’s food bodies due to raids by Makhno’s bands.    

The telegram said that in these circumstances supplying Donbas       

and the Red Army “becomes an almost insoluble task” (Central       

Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the           

C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

I think we should allow greater quantities to be
transported.[1]

Your fear of speculation is excessive.

Will it be so bad if they exchange individually for grain?
The peasants will obtain footwear and clothing. What we
should fear is mass speculation, and we cannot allow
speculation on a professional basis. But we should not hamper
but encourage importation into poverty-stricken Russia.

Please review.

A reference to a draft C.P.C. decree “On the Admission of
Russian Workers and Émigrés Returning from Abroad and of Their
Belongings”, which was prepared by the Narrow C.P.C. on March 2,
1921. It strictly limited the quantity of things—suits, footwear,
linen, etc.—which the workers arriving in Russia could bring with
them. Following Lenin’s remarks in this note, the Narrow C.P.C.
decided, on March 3, to delete the clause restricting the quantity
of personal belongings brought in.

3.III.1921

In sending over the minutes (No. 55) of the sitting of
the bureau of the All-Russia Central T.U.C. group of
3.III.1921, I propose that:

1)) point “g” should be withdrawn (in view of the Party
Congress which is to meet within a few days, and the need
to discuss this and similar other matters there),

2)) on point “l” 

be it resolved:

“To be referred to the Party
Congress.”[1]

I think it necessary to decide this over the telephone,
for it is indisputable that decisions cannot be taken before
the Party Congress or without it. We obviously cannot allow
panic to be spread for no good reason.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In Minutes No. 55 taken at the sitting of the bureau of the
All-Russia Central T.U.C. Party group on March 3, 1921, Lenin marked
off in the margin and underlined the text of points “g” and
“1”. Point “g” said: “The agenda of the All-Russia Central T.U.C.
Party group set for March 4, shall include a report by the People’s
Commissar for Food on the Republic’s food supply situation,
and the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Food shall
be asked to appoint its rapporteur on this question.” Point “1”
spoke of the need to bring to the notice of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee the decisions taken by the group’s bureau (Central

   

Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On March 3, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee adopted Lenin’s proposal.

refer this to the C.C. Politbureau. (Also find out for which
departments or subjects?)

“Vladimir Ilyich: we at the First Moscow University are now                 

setting up a social science department. We have appointed all                

the Communists who could be allowed to lecture. But there is                  

little hope of their actual participation. It is highly tempting    

to make use of Mensheviks (Groman, Yermansky, Sukhanov,                      

Cherevanin and Martov). What do you think about this?” (Central

Comrades Chicherin and Karakhan  

Please let me know your opinion and return both
documents to =
me.[2] I draw the attention of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to the fact that its
circumvention of the C.P.C. decision (through a “parallel”
apparatus or commission under another name or pretext) is
absolutely intolerable. I have the suspicion that the P.C.F.A.
is actually circumventing the C.P.C. decision. This is a
warning. I request a most precise opinion, without evasions
or suppression of the facts.

7/III. Lenin

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The document was written on a report by A. G. Goikhbarg,
Deputy Chairman of the Narrow C.P.C., about breaches by the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the C.P.C. decision
of November 30, 1920, concerning the work of the commission
on the question of the looses inflicted on Soviet Russia by the
imperialist war, the armed intervention of the Entente and the
blockade. The C.P.C. decision put the duty on the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade to place at the commission’s disposal all the
available material on this question. But in a letter to Lenin on
March 5, 1921 (which Lenin passed to Goikhbarg the same day),
Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs L. M.
Karakhan said that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs was
also working on the question of the losses and requested that the
material should be handed over to a commission of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

On April 14, 1921, the Narrow C.P.C. examined the question
of the P.C.F.A.’s violation of the C.P.C. decision and took into
consideration Karakhan’s statement that the P.C.F.A. had
stopped working on the question of the losses.

Comrade Tsyurupa:

We shall probably call our commission
tonight,[1] (we
shall hardly have any time during the day, after the
opening[2], although we shall try).


The question is pivoted on “turnover”, free economic
exchange for the peasantry.


You have not gone into the question deeply enough,
since you were arguing against Rakovsky (I had no time
for a rejoinder). The whole point is to be able to promote

    

commerce, exchange (both export abroad from the south and
exchange with the factories).  Otherwise, we shall collapse.

NB ||| 
Think about this and find a formula to insert this.


NB ||| 

2) Ask for these figures right away; how much
grain we gave in January 1921 and in February
(if there are no figures for the whole of February,
then for one-third or two-thirds of it) 1921. How
much imported, and how much altogether.

Comrade Chicherin:


I am extremely anxious about the Turks’ putting off
the signing of the agreement on Batum, playing for time
while their troops are moving to Batum. We must not allow
them such delays. Discuss the following measure: you will
adjourn your conference for half an hour to have a talk
with me, while Stalin will have a straightforward talk
with the Turkish delegation to clear things up and have
everything settled not later than
today.[1]


Lenin

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the Moscow Conference for the Conclusion of the
Soviet-Turkish Treaty (February 26–March 16, 1921), which ended
with the signing of the treaty of friendship and brotherhood
between the R.S.F.S.R. and Turkey.

The question of Batum arose in connection with the fact that
the Menshevik government of Georgia, which was on its last legs,
had, on the advice of the Entente, concluded in the first ten days
of March a secret agreement with the Turkish Government under
which the city of Batum together with the district and two other
districts were to be handed over to Turkey. Under this agreement
the Turkish troops advancing on Batum occupied it on March 11,
1921. On March 19, the Turkish troops were forced to retreat
from the city.

Kamenev and Stalin

Please pay attention to Dzerzhinsky’s reports on Sibera.
There is an extremely great and terrible danger that our
men will not be able to get on with the Siberian peasants.

    

For all his good qualities, Chutskayev is unquestionably
weak, has absolutely no military knowledge, and the
slightest aggravation may threaten disaster there. I think we
should discuss the question of sending Iv. N. Smirnov
to Siberia not later than the beginning of the summer.
He will, of course, very strongly object, but unless we have
another candidate with a knowledge of Siberia and of
military science, one who is sure not to lose his head in a
difficult situation, I think that it will be absolutely inevitable
for us to send
Smirnov.[1]

Comrade Rykov


Copies to Comrade Tsyurupa and Comrade Rakovsky

I ask you to take advantage of Comrade Rakovsky’s
presence in Moscow to organise, together with him and
Comrade Tsyurupa, a conference on the possibility and ways of
getting the peasants, on the one hand, and the
handicraftsmen and the factory population, on the other, to take a
practical interest in the exchange (organised on state lines,
as far as possible) of farm produce for industrial goods.
This conference must be organised very urgently.

Comrade Goikhbarg:

Read this letter from the representative of Soviet Georgia,
especially what is underscored (p. 3).
 

It is necessary immediately

1) to put through an injunction on sending (without the
permission of the Narrow Council), and to give permission
with the utmost
circumspection,[1]

2) to make regular check-ups on execution.

12/III. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a letter from F. I. Makharadze reporting the
military and political situation in Georgia. On the letter Lenin wrote:
“Return to me.” On page 3 of the letter, Lenin under underscored the
passage where Makharadze speaks out against the dispatch to
Georgia of a great number of authorised agents agents from the centre.

On March 14, 1921, the Narrow C.P.C. passed a decision
prohibiting all the People’s Commissariats from sending their agents
to Georgia without Special C.P.C. permission in each case.

I propose: to approve in principle and authorise the
P.C.F.T. to continue
negotiations[1] with the proviso,
however, that (1) no final decision is taken without the
Politbureau (which must remain free to make a rejection); and
that (2) an effort is made to secure a similar loan on better
terms with the other (Italian) offerer.

A reference to the negotiations by the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade on a 40–year 100–million kronen loan from
Sweden. The Swedish side wanted 7 per cent during the first two
years and 6 per cent during the rest of the period, until the
repayment of the loan. Negotiations on large credits from Sweden
were also conducted in the autumn of 1921, but were fruitless.

Comrade Semashko:

(1) I earnestly request you to appoint a special person
(preferably a well-known physician, with a knowledge of
foreign countries and known abroad for sending abroad, to
Germany (of Tsyurupa, Krestinsky, Osinsky, Kurayev,
Gorky, Korolenko and others). The utmost skill should be

    

employed in inquiring, requesting, persuading, and writing
to Germany, to help the sick, etc.

Do this most punctiliously

(thoroughly).

(2) Send the best physician to give N. I. Bukharin a
medical examination (the heart, among other things) and
let me know the result.

Moscow, March 17, 1921.   

Mr. Washington B. Vanderlip

Dear Sir,

I thank you for your kind letter of the 14th, and am very
glad to hear of President Harding’s favourable views as to
our trade with America. You know what value we attach to
our future American business relations. We fully recognise
the part played in this respect by your syndicate and also
the great importance of your personal
efforts.[2] Your new
proposals are highly interesting and I have asked the
Supreme Council of National Economy to report to me at
short intervals about the progress of the negotiations. You
can be sure that we will treat every reasonable suggestion
with the greatest attention and
care.[1]

It is on production
and trade that our efforts are principally concentrated
and your help is to us of the greatest value.

If you have to complain of some officials please send
your complaint to the-respective People’s Commissary who
will investigate the matter and report if necessary. I have
already ordered special investigation concerning the person
you mention in your letter.
 

The Congress of the Communist Party has taken so much
of my time and forces that I am very tired and ill. Will
you kindly excuse me if I am unable to have an interview
with you just now. I will beg Comrade Chicherin to speak
with you shortly.

Wishing you much success I remain.

Yours truly,


Wl. Oulianoff (Lenin)
 

Notes

See Document 94 of this volume.—Ed.
 



[2]
In the autumn of 1920, Washington Vanderlip, representing the
Vanderlip Syndicate, a large American concern, came to Moscow
for talks on a concession for fisheries, and exploration for and
extraction of oil and coal in Kamchatka and the rest of Eastern
Siberia to the east of longitude 160°. A draft agreement was worked
out at the end of October under which the syndicate was to
receive a 60–year concession. After 35 years the Soviet
Government was to have an option to buy out all the concession
enterprises, and upon the expiry of the whole period, the enterprises
and equipment in full running order were to be transferred free
of charge into the ownership of the R.S.F.S.R. However, the
syndicate failed to obtain support either from its own
government or from influential financial groups in the U.S.A., and the
draft agreement was not signed.

17.III.1921

Dear Comrade Joffe:

I was highly distressed to read your deeply perturbed
letter of
15/III.[1] I see that you have the most legitimate
grounds for dissatisfaction and even indignation, but I
assure you that you are wrong in seeking the causes of it.

First, you are wrong in saying (repeatedly) that “I am
the C.C.”. This could have been written only in a state
of great nervous irritation and overwork. The old C.C.
(1919–1920) defeated me on one of the vastly important
questions, as you must know from the
discussion.[2] I cannot
say how many times I have been in a minority on
organisational and personal matters. You must have seen this for
yourself on many occasions as a member of the C.C.

You should not allow yourself to be so nervous as to
write such an absolutely impossible, absolutely impossible
 thing that I am the C.C. This is overwork.

Second, I do not feel the slightest dissatisfaction with
you or mistrust of you in any way. Nor do the members
of the C.C., as far as I know them, have spoken to them
and seen their attitude towards you.
 

What then is the explanation of the matter? It is that
you have been tossed about by fate. I have seen this happen
to many workers. Take Stalin, as an example. You must
know that he would have stood up for himself, in any case.
But “fate” did not allow him, a single time in three and
a half years, to be either People’s Commissar for the
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, or People’s Commissar for
Nationalities. That is a fact.

You, like rather many other leading workers, have been
tossed about by fate. You are one of our first and best
diplomatists. Our diplomacy has been working on and off.
In the intervals, you have been “tried out” (W.P.I.), without
giving you time to finish things. It is the fault (the
misfortune?) of the whole C.C., which has tossed about many
people in this way. If you give this some cool thought,
you will see that this is true.

Failure to be elected to the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee? Ask anyone, Trotsky, for instance, how often
the C.C. has hesitated in its views of the principle and its
decisions on this! This has happened many times! We were
forced to make maximum renewals for considerations of
“democracy”.

(The new C.C. was constituted only yesterday and will
take some time to “gear
up”.[3])

My personal opinion, which is quite frank, is: (1) you
must have a good rest. It is harmful to fray oneself. We are
badly in need of experienced, veteran, tested workers.
Have a good rest. Perhaps, you will decide that it is better
to go to a sanatorium, abroad. It is bad over here. Your
health must be completely restored. (2) You have been and
remain one of our leading and best diplomatists and
politicians. Take Turkey? Turkestan? Can we do without you?
Rumania? I’m afraid we cannot. I think we cannot.

Have a rest. Then come to Moscow, we shall have a talk.

With best wishes,


Yours,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter to Lenin on March 15, 1921, A. A. Joffe, who was
then in Riga as chairman of the Soviet peace delegation
negotiating with Poland, expressed dissatisfaction over the fact that
despite his extensive experience in political and especially
diplomatic work, the Party’s C.C. kept transferring him from one
job to another.





[2]
A probable reference to the Plenary Meeting of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee on December 7, 1920, which discussed the
conflict between the water transport union, and Tsektran
(Central Committee of the Joint Trade Union of Rail and Water
Transport Workers). During the discussion of this question, Lenin and
his supporters were left in a minority, and the resolution
proposed by N. I. Bukharin was carried will) L. D. Trotsky’s
support. Lenin analysed this episode in his article “The Party
Crisis” (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 45).





[3]
A reference to the Party Central Committee elected at the 13th
sitting of the Tenth Party Congress on March 14, 1921. On March
16, after the Congress had closed, a plenum of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee met to elect the governing organs of the C.C.

Fully in favour.

Lenin

Authorise Chicherin to draw up a draft message and put
it through at this very session of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter to the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee of March 18, 1921, saying that, according to
information received through Washington Vanderlip, the new
U.S. President William Harding (who succeeded Woodrow
Wilson in March 1921, as a Republican President) was allegedly in
favour of establishing trade relations with Soviet Russia. In tins
connection, Chicherin proposed that the session of the
All-Russia C.E.C., which was to open, should adopt a Message on the
desirability of establishing trade relations between Soviet
Russia and the U.S.A. On March 20, the All-Russia C.E.C. sent a
Message to the Congress of the U.S.A. and President Harding.
However, this and other friendly acts by the Soviet Government
did not meet with any response from the U.S. Government which
persisted in refusing to recognise the Soviet state. This hostile
U.S. stand delayed the normalisation of diplomatic and trade
relations between the two countries for many years.

In connection with preparations to switch from the surplus-food
requisitioning to the tax in kind, Lenin was collecting and
studying peasant opinion on ways to boost agriculture. In early
March 1921, on his invitation, Moscow was visited by peasants
A. R. Shaposhnikov, T. G. Kondrov and I. G. Kondrov, who

   

had talks with Lenin, M. I. Kalinin and A. D. Tsyurupa, and
attended a sitting of the All-Russia C.E.C. which approved the
substitution of the tax in kind for surplus-food requisitioning.
Upon their return home, the peasants reported on their trip and
meeting with Lenin to the gubernia non-Party peasant
conference at Ufa. The conference sent Tsyurupa a telegram declaring
that they “noted with satisfaction the promulgation of new land
tenure laws” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Dear Comrade Kayurov;

I have received your letter of 1.III.21, concerning the
tax.

In the meantime (while your letter was en route), the
tax has already been passed by the Tenth Party Congress
and by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. You
must know about this from the papers.

Write me from time to time of your local impressions.
How have the Siberian peasants met the tax? What are
their other demands and feelings? How are things with
the workers?

Best wishes,


Yours,


Lenin

Comrade Kamenev:

Badaich[1]

has earnestly requested me to help them in
having the old Yakunchikov estate and the Khodynski
farmstead transferred to the
M.C.C.[2]


He argues that they are close to Moscow. This would
give Muscovites a vegetable garden and a farm.

He says that the Gubernia Land Department will handle
the supplies itself.

Badaich refers to the good experience gained in
Petrograd, where a farm was run on model lines.

In principle: the city’s interest should have an effect
on the “diligence”. Badayev is right in principle.

Or we could do this: let Badaich have it, and give the
Gubernia Land Department a formal order: you must not
lag behind with your state farms, and make a comparison
in the autumn.

Lenin

P.S. In general, press forward with the
vegetablegarden campaign. Should we raise this in the Council of
Labour and Defence? To provide the pressure?

26.III.1921 

Comrade Rykov:

This is to remind you of the promise you gave me over   the phone yesterday: to ask
Glavneft[1]

for a short report
for me on oil tank cars (the total number of sound tank
cars for oil over the entire railway network, minus those
engaged of necessity on other railways, for instance, from
the Volga to Moscow, except the South-Eastern. The
difference is the number of tank cars that can and must carry
oil from Grozny (and Baku) to Moscow. How many are
actually carrying it?).

It would be good (but not compulsory) to append a draft
decision by the C.L.D. concerning the full and correct use
of oil tank
cars.[2]

When can I have it?

Lenin

Central Oil Administration.—Ed.
 



[2]
A reference to the C.L.D. decision of December 15, 1920,
approving the oil transportation plan, submitted on December 14 by
the Supreme Council for Transportation. The decision set out a
number of practical measures connected with the transportation
of oil, ranging from the repair of tank cars and their efficient
use, to the establishment of running rates. Special measures were
outlined for supplying food and clothes to the workers in the
oil-fields and the railways.

Comrade Tsyurupa:

By tomorrow noon I need the following data:

1) The quantity of grain (and fodder grain) given to
the population 
    

monthly figures 1919–1920
1920–1921

Three columns

food
grain

potatoes

fodder
grain


2) The quantity of grain collected (by the Commissariat
for Food):
net surplus-requisition
1920–1921 total

for grinding
(for the available

number of months)


3) The number of gubernias (and assessments for them)
which have fulfilled deliveries (1920–1921)

100% for a given month
75% ”


Tell Senin, or whoever is in charge of this, that I shall
have him arrested unless I get the figures, signed by the
responsible person, by noon.

Lenin

P.S. Two other things:

1) Perhaps there have been other collections of grain
for “services” apart from the “spade-per-sack” for
grinding?

2) Have you any data on the “free” price of salt (in terms
of grain), etc.? (You will recall that I have been asking
for this a long time ago.)

27.III.1921

Comrade Dzerzhinsky:

Please write for me, or have your secretary write for
me, a short (10–20 lines) note about the unsuccessful

    

purchase of 400 (instead of 1,000) poods of accessories for
making boots (accessories whose selection was
unsatisfactory, wrong).

I need this to issue instructions on what we are to avoid
and how. How similar mistakes are to be
avoided.[1]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In reply to this note, Dzerzhinsky sent Lenin a short report the
same day describing the circumstances of the unsuccessful
purchase of foreign tacks. On Dzerzhinsky’s report Lenin wrote:
“(About tacks). Keep and give me a reminder” (Lenin
Miscellany XXXVI, p. 211).

27/III. 

Comrade Preobrazhensky:

The “co-operative” circles, headed by Prokopovich,
Kuskova & Co., are said to wish to make this proposal to
the government: 

we shall help you to restore the currency, if you allow
us to issue bonds secured by our (co-operative)
commodity stocks.

This is ridiculous, because it is tantamount to the
capitalists’ proposal: we shall help you to restore the
currency, if you let us have commodity stocks.

But apart from being ridiculous, it emphasises the gist
of the matter: we must start just now, when the tax in kind
and the exchange (for grain) are being introduced, to make
systematic preparations to “improve” the currency through
the issue of bonds secured by commodities (the commodity
stocks, the grain stocks, etc.).

There must be no delay over this. This should be thought
out, prepared and started, without waiting for the settlement
of the silver issue.

Have you brought all this up for your commission, and
in
it?[2]

Drop me a couple of lines by 11 a.m. tomorrow (28).

We shall appoint you a member of the Collegium of the
People’s Commissariat for Finance, This will not take much
time, but will put you in touch with the
P.C.F.[3]
 

Give your attention to Falkner (him;
“her”[1]

brother).
Perhaps he will move closer to us and join in the work?

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Rykov:

I have gone over your material on the concession
agreement, and am highly
indignant.[1]

This is either sabotage or idiocy on the part of Dosser
& Co.!

There is a host of useless and ridiculous details
(prohibition to light fires, etc.), but the important things have
not been brought out.

The serious matters have been swamped in bureaucratic
litter.

There is no sign of brains, thinking brains.

What is Lomov doing?

You have wrecked the C.P.C. decision
(2/II.1921),[2]
requiring the working out of the main principles within
three weeks!/

These principles must be worked out tomorrow (i.e.,
28/III) at all costs, and they should be concise enough to
be telegraphed to Krasin.

Show them to me before that.

I append my own draft, a rough and hasty outline: I take
the important and the controversial
items.[3] I think the
rest is less important or indisputable.

Stop the sabotage and do the job properly, otherwise
I shall fight it out in the C.C.
 

Who is on your “concessions commission”? Its
membership: reply before 11 a.m. tomorrow.

Lenin

Comrade Trotsky:

Have a look at this (it’s interesting) and return to
me.[1]
I am going to speak with Kharkov this very day.

Don’t you find the attitudes over the concessions
amusing? There’s the Baku and Donbas “patriotism”.

It is nonetheless highly desirable to let the
concessionaires have a quarter of Donbas (+Krivoi Rog).

What do you think?

Lenin 
 

Notes

A reference to G. L. Pyatakov’s letter of March 22, 1921,
requesting Lenin’s assistance in sending S. I. Syrtsov for Party
work in Donbas, which, he said, was being opposed by the
Ukrainian Communist Party C.C., because during the trade union
discussion Syrtsov had sided with the Trotskyites. On March 30,
Lenin sent a telephone message to G. I. Petrovsky and M. V.
Frunze, in Kharkov, asking them to look into the matter and
reply (see this volume, Document 109).

Pyatakov also objected to any concessions in Donbas.

P.C.R.

The People’s Commissar for Railways

29.III.1921 

Comrade Yemshanov:

Please let me know who at the P.C.R. is in charge of
the allocation of tank cars (for oil) throughout the network
and the carriage of oil along the railways.

1) Who is responsible for this?

2) What has the People’s Commissariat done precisely
in fulfilment of the C.L.D. decision on this matter (15
or   17.XII.1920)?[3]

3) Who adopted and when—and also who cancelled and
when—the order attaching oil tank cars to the various
railway lines?

4) How are the tank cars distributed throughout the
network at this moment?
 

If what you say in the last column of the first table
(“actually available” on what date?) of your “reference-report”
(a paper without any date) (received on 29.III) is correct,
how do you explain that there are (183+161+22+88+9+
493+1,405+194=) 2,555 tank cars on 8 railway lines,
although these lines have no “filling targets”?

5) Could I have fuller data on the availability and   operation of tank cars, with the railway lines under three   heads and
totals[2]

for the three groups:

(a) (1) railway lines carrying oil from the Volga

(b) (2) ” ” ” ”
from the Caucasus   (Grozny and Baku)

(c) (3) railway lines not carrying oil?

6) Why is the speed of the petroleum trains taken at   6 versts an hour? Are there any technical obstacles (which   exactly) for reaching the maximum speed (say, of the   military trains)? What was our pre-war speed? What is our   minimum and maximum speed in actual fact for 1920?

Please let me know which of the foregoing data you can   give me right away, and which at the earliest possible   date (when exactly?)?

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Earnestly request most serious attention to yesterday’s
question of the Army and concessions in Georgia. The
Georgian Menshevik government has concluded a number of
concessions. We must try to do our utmost to renew the
old concessions and our best to conclude new ones as soon
as possible, so as to get foodstuffs in exchange for the
concessions. Show this to the Georgian Revolutionary
Committee, and let me know their reply quickly.

Pyatakov has been strongly requesting my help in
getting Sergei Syrtsov from Odessa as a secretary to Donbas.
Pyatakov has accused the Ukrainian Communist Party C.C.
of unwillingness to let him have Syrtsov only because of
factional fears, since Syrtsov is said to be a Trotskyite.
Pyatakov declares that both he and Syrtsov promise not to
conduct any factional policies. I don’t know Syrtsov. Please
collect all information and reply to me.

Comrade Chicherin:

I fully agree with
you.[1] Draft or have someone draft
such a circular (could it include the whole of Narimanov’s
speech, or at least its recommendation—this is worse than
the whole).

Motion this in the C.C.

It is necessary.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Chicherin’s letter to the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee, received by Lenin, in which Chicherin proposed that a
special circular, urging the need for tact and care not to offend
the Moslems’ religious feelings in conducting anti-religious
propaganda, should be sent to the Party organisations of the republics
and regions with a Moslem population. Chicherin referred to
a speech by N. N. Narimanov as a model of the tactful approach
to Moslems. In Chicherin’s letter Lenin underscored the passages
proposing the publication of the circular and characterising
Narimanov’s speech (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

I also fear that we shall spend the whole of our small
gold stock on food or on trade, with nothing to show for it.

    

You are responsible for the economies. It is absolutely
necessary to improve the condition of the workers and
peasants. We must speedily obtain a definite stock of goods
from abroad to exchange for grain; this is a political
necessity; work on these lines and keep me informed.

2.IV.1921

Comrade Serebrovsky:

I am sending you some material on the oil concessions.
I wanted to send it along with Comrade Kaminsky, but
unfortunately, because of his grave illness, he had to be
given treatment over here.

It is extremely important for the Baku comrades to adopt
the correct view of the concessions (a view approved by the
Tenth Party Congress, i.e., binding on all Party members).
It is highly desirable to let the concessionaires have a
quarter of Baku (or perhaps two-quarters) (on condition of
assistance from abroad both in foodstuffs and equipment,
over and above the concessionaires’ own
requirements[1]

).

Only then is there any hope of using the other
three-quarters (or two-quarters) to catch up with (and then to forge
ahead of) modern advanced capitalism. Any other view
boils down to the most harmful attitude of a
“walkover”, “we’ll manage on our own”, and other such-like
rubbish which presents an increasingly greater danger the
more it is clad in “purely communist” attire.
 

Write me at once if there are still any traces (even the
slightest) of these most harmful views and prejudices in
Baku (among the workers and among the intellectuals):
do you undertake to dispel these prejudices yourself and
secure the most loyal implementation of the congress
decision (for the concessions) or do you need my help? Make
sure that you and everyone else realise that “the concessions
are extremely desirable. There is nothing more harmful
or fatal for communism than communist boasting—we’ll
manage on our own”.

Now that we have Batum, we must do our utmost to
arrange the speediest possible exchange of oil and kerosene
for equipment abroad.

For this the Baku district needs some independence.
If you do not have it, telegraph precisely, we shall let you
have
it.[2]

Formulate precise proposals—send them over to the
C.L.D. by telegram and letter. There is need for a regional
economic centre, responsible for Baku+Batum, etc., and
conducting operations independently, swiftly, without red
tape.

We cannot help you from over here, we are poor
ourselves. You must help us by buying everything necessary
from abroad in exchange for oil and oil products.

Awaiting your reply: a short one by telegram “(letter
of 2/IV received, prejudices over concessions exist, hard
(or easy) to overcome, concerning exchange of goods with
foreign countries and the regional centre, will do or are
doing so-and-so”) and give details by mail.

There is an urgent necessity for correct contacts with
the C.L.D.; that is the main thing.

Another question: is there a correct approach in Baku
to the question of oil from the standpoint of
co-ordinating the various aspects of the national economy? After all,
the territory is very rich: forests, fertile land (given the
irrigation), etc. We are pumping water (with oil) but not
using the water for irrigation, which would yield great
crops of hay, rice, cotton? Not making use of the “north
wind” to run windmills? But, of course, foodstuffs and
irrigation are the main things. Is it possible to develop

    

the oil industry without developing irrigation and farming   around Baku? Is anyone thinking about this and working   on it properly? What about the English irrigation plan?

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
I had a telegram from Krasin yesterday in reply to the draft
concession terms sent to him: “acceptable in the main.” Krasin,
let me add, has a knowledge of this business not from communist
pamphlets!—Lenin
 



[2]
On April 16, 1921, a telegram was received from Chairman of
the Oil Committee, A. P. Serebrovsky, asking Lenin “To send
in an official recognition of some independence for the Oil
Committee to exchange oil products in Persia, Turkestan and Europe
for articles of equipment and supply of workers with clothes and
foodstuffs” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On April 18, Lenin requested A. I. Rykov, V. P. Milyutin
and A. M. Lezhava to give their opinion and an agreed draft
C.P.C. decision on this matter. On April 19, the C.P.C.
appointed a special commission to work out a draft decision enlarging
the competence of the Azerbaijan Oil Committee in this sphere.

2.IV.1921

Comrade Schmidt, People’s Commissar for Labour


Trotsky, People’s Commissar for Defence


Tsyurupa, People’s Commissar for Food


Rykov, Supreme Economic Council


Tomsky, All-Russia Central Trade Union
Council

Comrade Shlyapnikov, the initiator
of the present proposal

I request you to call a conference of the afore-mentioned
People’s Commissars (+Chairman of the All-Russia
Central T.U.C.) or persons specially authorised by them to
deal with this question of 

improving the factories and plants through a reduction
in the number of mouths and workers (from among peasants,
mobilised armymen, etc.) unproductively listed at the
factories; for a definite period, the old quantity of foodstuffs
should be made available to each enterprise in order to
increase labour productivity.

The conference should end its deliberations as soon as
possible, namely: it is desirable to place the matter before
the C.C. Politbureau on Tuesday morning (by noon),
5/IV. 1921.

The convocation is up to Comrade
Schmidt.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
That same day, April 2, 1921, People’s Commissar for Labour,
V. V. Schmidt, called an interdepartmental conference to
discuss the questions brought up by Lenin. Its decision said: “In
the event of a balanced reduction in the total number of
unproductive workers listed as employed in the given production, the
quantity of foodstuffs assigned for it by the People’s
Commissariat for Food before the reduction of the unproductively

   

employed workers shall be retained for this production” (Central
Party Archives, of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Orjonikidze

Your reply is neither full nor
clear.[1] Please find out
the details from the Georgian Revolutionary Committee.
First, has the Soviet Government of Georgia confirmed
the concession on the Tkvarcheli mines to the Italians,
when, on what terms, reply briefly by telegram, details
by letter? Second, about the Chiatura manganese mines:
have the German owners been transferred to the status of
lessees or concessionaires, when, on what terms. It is
extremely important to have the speediest decisions on these
and similar other matters. This is of tremendous importance
both for Georgia and for Russia, because the concessions,
especially to Italy and Germany, are absolutely necessary,
as is the exchange of goods for oil, on a large scale with
these countries, and subsequently, with others as well.

Please, keep me informed about the measures taken by
the Georgian Revolutionary Committee.

5/IV.1921.

Please urgently settle the following Gidrotorf questions:

1. About bonuses in kind for factories making
equipment for Gidrotorf (see Gidrotorf letter to the S.E.C.
Presidium No. 1252 of 26/III);

2. On granting to Gidrotorf the right to appoint a
contractor for preparatory work for Gidrotorf’s establishment
at the Electroperedacha Station, as has already been

    

sanctioned by the decision of the Council of Labour and
Defence for the Electroperedacha Station (see Gidrotorf
letter to the S.E.C. Presidium No. 1329 of 31/III);

3. About Gidrotorf’s complaint against the decision by
the Commission for supplying foodstuffs to responsible
S.E.C. workers of 22/III, under which the 100 rations
allowed to Gidrotorf by the People’s Commissariat for Food
for Gidrotorf’s responsible workers were reduced by 27
rations (see Gidrotorf letter to the S.E.C. Presidium
No. 1347 of 31/III);

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of Gidrotorf (Administration for Hydraulic Peat
Extraction) was discussed at C.P.C. sittings. On April 5, 1921,
the C.P.C. heard reports by V. D. Kirpichnikov and I. I.
Radchenko on the progress of Gidrotorf operations, and adopted a
decision on the need to satisfy its requests in view of the
exceptional importance of these enterprises. A special commission,
consisting of A. Z. Holtzmann, A. B. Khalatov and I. I.
Radchenko, was given two days to determine in detail the volume
and priorities for meeting Gidrotorf’s requests. Its report was
heard by the C.P.C. on April 7. It was decided that Gidrotorf
should be allocated 25 million rubles for distribution of
individual bonuses to skilled technical personnel over a period of five
months.

On April 6, the C.L.D. discussed the general question of
measures ensuring the supply of food for the peat campaign.

Comrade Kamenev:

I send this for your information. I have not read it
myself.[1]

NB: We have been too hasty, hasty to no purpose with
the law on bonuses in kind in the form of factory products
for
exchange.[2] Mark my word: haste is harmful in this
matter, and will lead to no good.

All possible delays and limitations of this measure could
still and should be put through.

Otherwise, you will be very sorry (and you yourself,
above all, because the workers will curse you for the
“fraud”).

Yours,

Lenin

Comrade Molotov:

Unless my memory fails me, I believe the newspapers
carried a C.C. letter or circular about May Day, which

    

said: expose the falsehood of religion, or something to that
effect.

That is not right. It is tactless. Just because it is the
Easter holiday, we should recommend something quite
different: 

not to expose the falsehood, 

but absolutely to avoid any affront to religion.

We should issue an additional letter or
circular.[1] If the
Secretariat does not agree, then in the Politbureau.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In addition to an earlier circular, the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee published a letter in Pravda on April 21, 1921, urging that
in celebrating May Day “nothing should be done or said to offend
the religious feelings of the mass of the population”.

14/IV. 

Comrade Kamenev:

It is said that within three or four months the workers
will demand the lifting of free trading. We do not want,
they say, to see the bureaucrats eat buns.

Perhaps, we should take measures in advance:

1) at once press forward to the utmost with holiday
homes. Increase their number during the summer and the
autumn. Later, we shall also sometimes buy “buns” for
the “holiday-makers” by turns;

2) think about other ways of taking turns in purchasing
gifts for children or those awarded bonuses.

But the first thing is more important. Write me what
you think and what is being done.

3) At Ivanovo–Voznesensk we should set up a Sverdlov
University for 1,000–1,500 persons. Don’t forget.

Salut! Lenin

14/IV. 

Comrade Pyatakov:

I am sending you (secretly and not for the press, by
any means) material on the concessions. This is an answer
to your questions.

You will see how we are conducting the concessions policy.

Concerning the Donbas we are awaiting the results of
your work. I took the plus 10 per cent to mean over and
above 600 million, as a
programme,[1] and not “over and
above”... the earlier figure!

“If I had the grain, I would....” Aren’t you ashamed to
repeat these cliches? Of course, if someone gave it to you....

No, sir, you will have to hustle and get everything
yourself: the salt, and grain for the salt, etc.

We need initiative, drive, local commerce, and not
begging: if someone gave it to me.... Shame!

Salut! Lenin

Comrade Tsyurupa:

I think we should give him a reprimand. This is sheer
whimpering and excuses. Before the decision of the
AllRussia Central Executive Committee he should have called
up by direct line (and right away, in March, but not in
April). Instead of whimpering, he should have requested
the special All-Russia Central Executive Committee
decision in good time. He is a silly whimpering old woman.

Comrade Molotov:

I have just learned from Rykov that the professors (of
Moscow Higher Technical College) do not yet know about
(yesterday’s)
decision.[1]

This is outrageous, and monstrously late. I shall raise
the question of the C.C. apparatus in the Politbureau.
We can’t have that sort of thing, no indeed.

The draft statement by Lunacharsky was ready
yesterday.[2] It should have been made public the same day.

You must give orders at once for everything to be done,
and to check up whether it has been.

You must verify and spur things on.

Delay is intolerable.

Lenin

Central Committee of April 14, 1921, about the state of affairs

the decision to the effect that the college board was to be
appointed by the Central Administration for Vocational Training,
and suggested that the People’s Commissariat for Education
submit for consideration by the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee
a draft statute for institutions of higher learning and a new
composition of the board, and also a draft directive on the role and
relationships of the communist cells, the non-Party students,
the faculty and the People’s Commissariat for Education. The
Politbureau also asked the People’s Commissariat for Education
to issue a condemnation of the college lecturers who had
suspended classes.

Committee V. M. Molotov. A reprimand was issued to the members
of the faculty who had suspended classes, and it was pointed out
to them that such methods of protest were inadmissible. At the
same time, the communist cells at the college and at all
institutions of higher learning were invited to establish relations with
the faculty and non-Party students promoting normal academic
life in their institutions and the development of science in Soviet
Russia.

16.4.1921.   

Comrades Zetkin and Levi:

Thank you very much for your letters, dear Friends.
Unfortunately, I have been so busy and so overworked in
the last few weeks that I have had practically no
opportunity to read the German press. The only thing I have seen
is the Open
Letter,[2] which I think is perfectly correct
tactics (I have condemned the contrary opinion of our
“Lefts” who were opposed to this letter). As for the recent
strike movement and the action in Germany, I have read
absolutely nothing about
it.[3] I readily believe that the
representative of the Executive Committee defended the
silly tactics, which were too much to the left—to take
immediate action “to help the Russians”: this representative
is very often too
Left.[4] I think that in such cases you
should not give in but should protest and immediately
bring up this question officially at a plenary meeting of
the Executive Bureau.

I consider your tactics in respect of Serrati erroneous.
Any defence or even semi-defence of Serrati was a mistake.
But to withdraw from the Central Committee!!?? That, in
any case, was the biggest mistake! If we tolerate the
practice of responsible members of the Central Committee
withdrawing from it when they are left in a minority, the
Communist Parties will never develop normally or  become
strong.[5] Instead of withdrawing, it would have been
better to discuss the controversial question several times
jointly with the Executive Committee. Now, Comrade Levi
wants to write a pamphlet, i.e., to deepen the
contradiction! What is the use of all this?? I am convinced that it
is a big
mistake.[6]

Why not wait? The congress opens here on
June 1.[7]
Why not have a private discussion here, before the congress?

    

Without public polemics, without withdrawals, without
pamphlets on differences. We are so short of tried and
tested forces that I am really indignant when I hear
comrades announcing their withdrawal, etc. There is need to
do everything possible and a few things that are impossible
to avoid withdrawals and aggravation of differences at all
costs.

Our position in February and March was grave. This is
a peasant country, with a peasant economy—the vast
majority of the population. They vacillate, they are ruined and
are disgruntled. But we should not be too pessimistic.
We have made some timely concessions. And I am sure
that we shall win.

Best regards and wishes.

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
On the copy, Lenin made the following remarks: “This is my 
 reply to Levi and Zetkin, 16/4, 1921”, “Keep in the archives. Make 
 another 2 or 3 copies”, “Return”, “received 17/V—1921”.—Ed.
 



[2]
The “Open Letter” (“Offener Brief”) from the Central Committee
of the United Communist Party of Germany to the Socialist Party
of Germany, the Independent Social-Democratic Party of
Germany, the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany, and to nil
trade union organisations was published in Die Rote Fahne No. 11
on January 8, 1921. The letter urged nil workers’, trade union
and socialist organisations in Germany to join efforts in fighting

   

the growing reaction and the capitalist offensive against the
working people’s vital rights.

Although the workers came out in favour of the united
proletarian front, the proposal for joint action with the Communists
was rejected by the Right-wing leadership of the organisations
to which the “Open Letter” was addressed.





[3]
A reference to armed action by the proletariat of Germany in
March 1921.

The Left-wing majority of the C.C. of the United Communist
Party of Germany, proceeding from the so-called “theory of the
offensive”, whose supporters held that offensive tactics were the
only correct ones in any situation, regardless of the concrete
political conditions, pushed the workers towards a premature
uprising. Making use of this, the German bourgeoisie provoked
armed action at an unfavourable moment. An uprising broke
out in several areas of Central Germany in March 1921. Despite
the workers’ heroic action, the uprising was put down, because
the majority of the working class had not been prepared for the
action and had not taken part in the fighting.





[4]
A reference to Béla Kun, then member of the Presidium of the
Comintern Executive Committee.





[5]
Paul Levi attended the Seventeenth Congress of the Italian
Socialist Party as a representative of the United Communist Party
of Germany. The congress was held at Livorno from January 15
to 21, 1921, and marked a split in the Party. Upon his return
to Germany Levi came out in defence of the Italian Centrists
headed by Giacinto Serrati. On February 24, 1921, after the Central
Committee of the United Communist Party of Germany adopted
a resolution against Serrati and his supporters, and welcomed
the establishment of the Communist Party of Italy, five members
of the Central Committee of the United Communist Party of
Germany (Otto Bra&Bwhatthe, Ernst Däumig, A. Hoffmann, Paul Levi, and
Clara Zetkin) withdrew from the C.C., saying that they disagreed
with the Central Committee.





[6]
On March 29, 1921, Paul Levi wrote Lenin a letter to which the
present document is a reply. Levi condemned the March action
and declared that he was withdrawing from the Party
leadership and would write a pamphlet setting out his views.

In early April 1921, Levi issued a pamphlet entitled Unser
Weg. Wider den Putschismus (“Our Way. Against Putschism”),
in which lie called the struggle of hundreds of thousands of
German proletarians a “Bakuninist putsch”. Levi urged the workers
to condemn the Communists, alleging that they were responsible
for the defeat of the uprising. On April 15, 1921, the Central
Committee of the U.C.P.G. expelled Levi from the Party for a gross
breach of the Party discipline and the harm done to the Party
by the publication of his pamphlet, and demanded that he give

   

up his parliamentary seat. On April 29, the Comintern Executive
Committee endorsed the decision of the U.C.P.G. Central
Committee expelling Levi from the Party. The question of the tactical
differences which arose in connection with the March action was
referred to the Third Congress of the Comintern, which confirmed
Levi’s expulsion from the Party. Subsequently Levi went over
entirely to Social-Democratic positions and carried on a light
against the Communist International.

[1]
This assignment to V. M. Molotov was written on a memorandum
from a group of members of the interim presidium and the
scientific methods commission of the Moscow State University to the
Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on the training of
Soviet specialists. They criticised the old faculty opposing any
renovation of the higher schools, and made their own proposals to
amend the draft statute of institutions of higher learning adopted
by the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Education.

On April 20, 1921, the Politbureau asked the People’s
Commissariat for Education to refrain from publishing the statute
for the time being, for the purpose of elaborating and discussing
the question additionally.

According to available information, the Georgian State
Bank with full staffs of qualified employees and with
deposits from foreign missions has remained in Georgia. If

    

this is true, the Bank should be maintained as a credit
apparatus for foreign trade, and it should perhaps be turned
into a bank for the whole Transcaucasus in view of the
projected economic integration of the Transcaucasian
republics.

There is fierce agitation against the R.S.F.S.R. abroad
over the Sovietisation of Georgia, especially by Martov,
Tsereteli and others. The Georgian Revolutionary Committee
must start serious counter-agitation, which should note,
first, the R.S.F.S.R.’s peace-making role, second, the
active initiative by the Georgian workers, peasants and army
masses, who overthrew the Georgian bourgeois
government, and, third, the role of the Azerbaijan and Armenian
Soviet governments, who gave support to the Armenian,
Tatar and Georgian insurgents by way of self-defence against
the aggressive steps taken by the Georgian bourgeois
government, which set up an Azerbaijan and an Armenian
bourgeois government at Tiflis for the purpose of
subverting the Soviet regime in Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Make thorough collection of material against the
Menshevik Georgian government and bring it along to Moscow
for the plenary meeting.

Comrade Gorbunov:

Help to improve this, and when it is brought up to X,
let me know.

Lenin

...A new photoelement has been invented which, coupled with
an amplifier valve, makes it possible at some distance (20–30 metres)
to record the emanation of radio (oscillation) energy. With the action
of this photoelement, an amplifying device directed at a (black or
white) object will throw its reflection on a screen with the aid of a

    


x |||


receiving radio station. With an improved instrument, the following
results could be achieved:
1) with a radio telephone, a moving image
of a speaking person could be seen on the screen;
2) an enemy
squadron, moving hundreds of versts away, could be reflected on the
screen.

... The invention has been made by a Russian engineer, Mikhail
Alexandrovich Bonch-Bruyevich.

With comradely greetings,


A. Nikolayev

Comrade Stalin:

I object to Fomin. We mustn’t do it the “Russian way”.
We must do it the “Georgian” way.
We shall take it to the Politbureau.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with the telegram from Deputy People’s
Commissar for Railways, V. V. Fomin, proposing that
Georgian and Abkhazian ports (Batum, Poti and Sukhum) should
be placed under the Administration of Marine Transport of the
R.S.F.S.R. at Rostov or Novorossiisk. The Georgian
Revolutionary Committee opposed the idea.

On April 19, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee supported the Georgian Revolutionary Commit lee and
decided to place the organisation of Georgian and Abkhazian ports
within Georgia’s competence. The decision put the duty on the
Administration of Marine Transport to render every kind of
material assistance to these ports.

19/IV. 

Comrade Preobrazhensky:

Some of your remarks today show that you think the
Politbureau decision on the professors to be a
mistake.[1]

I’m afraid there is here some misunderstanding. I’m
afraid you have net interpreted the decision precisely.

I quite allow that Kalinnikov (that’s his name, isn’t
it?) is a reactionary. There are also, unquestionably,
malicious
Cadets[2] among them. But they should be exposed
in a different way. And exposed they should be on concrete
occasions. Give such an assignment to Kozmin (but he is
not too clever: watch your step with him): come up with
an exposure over a precise fact, act or statement. Then we

    

can put him in jail for a month, or a year. That will be a
lesson to him.

The same applies to a malicious Cadet.

The same, if class enemies have slandered Ignatov (? that’s
his name, isn’t it? I do not know him).

We must prepare the material, verify it, expose the
culprits and condemn them in the full view of all, and
impose exemplary punishment.

The military specialist is caught out on treason. But
the military specialists have all been recruited, and are
working. Lunacharsky and Pokrovsky don’t know how to
“catch out” their own specialists and, being dissatisfied
with themselves, are taking it out of everybody else.

That is Pokrovsky’s mistake. In fact, you and I may
not have all that many differences.

The worst thing about the People’s Commissariat for
Education is the lack of system, of self-control. Their
communist cells are also shockingly “lax”.

The people over at the P.C.E. have still to learn how
to work out methods of “catching out” their specialists and
punishing them, and of catching out and training the
communist cells.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

I think we must have both. It will be useful because
they will be propounding Marxism (if they start agitating
for Menshevism, we shall catch them out: we must keep an
eye on them).

Both should be recruited for working out a most
detailed programme (and an outline of lectures) on philosophy,
and a plan for publications on philosophy.

think it is advisable to have Deborin and L. Axelrod lecture on
philosophy (history of philosophy and historical materialism)?
This is an inquiry from the Academic Council of
Sverdlov University. We in the Orgbureau took a negative

   

decision concerning L. Axelrod, and it is now being raised again
by the group of lecturers” (Central Party Archives of the

All-Russia Cheka

I have been informed that the trip abroad by Grigory
Semyonovich Petrov, a chemist and an inventor, is being,
impeded.

Petrov has a mandate from the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade, signed by Voikov, dated 29/III–1921,
No. 1554 (A) 012. 

There is a decision by the committee for assessing
inventions of 9/II-1921, awarding Petrov a prize of 15
million rubles, etc. (signed by Mikhailovsky).
 

I request the P.C.F.A. and the All-Russia Cheka to
issue instructions to let him go abroad at once. If there
are any obstacles to this, please inform me right away.

and also to Comrade Kritsman, to whom the notification
was conveyed through Comrade Holtzmann,

24/IV. 

Comrade Zinoviev:

In view of the extremely unsatisfactory quality of the
“specimen copy” of the Atlas of Russia (although it has
taken many months to prepare), please let me know the
names of all those responsible for the work, those who
had been doing it before and are doing it now. Here is a
short list of the defects.
 

I received a “specimen copy” of the Atlas of Russia
yesterday. (The First State Cartographic Establishment,
former owner Ilyin.)

The Atlas of Russia should and must become a school
atlas.

But this calls for a number of corrections and additions,
because the specimen copy is highly unsatisfactory.

I list the main defects, requiring unconditional
correction.

1. There is no text “from the publisher” (there used to
be one before). Such a text should be written, saying that
on the model of “Railways”, the present school atlas has
been compiled in accordance with such-and-such a plan.

2. The maps are not numbered, and there are no
symbols (they were there before). These should be added. The
maps should not be by railways or not only by railways,
but by gubernias as well. The numeration of the maps
should contain a list of the gubernias included in full.
And the gubernias entered in the list should be given on
the map in full.

Map No. 1 does not contain gubernias in full: Petrograd,
Pskov and others. Cherepovets and other gubernias are not
designated.

There are similar defects in the other maps. Correct
this.

3. The boundaries of the republics (the Ukraine) and
the autonomous regions should be specifically shown. This
has mostly not been done, Neither for the Ukraine, nor
for Byelorussia. (The German Commune? Mari Region? All
the Caucasian republics?)

4. The railway lines have not been verified for a given
date (say, 1.I.1921). Their indication is incorrect. The
finished lines are not specified. The ones under
construction are not shown. Correct this.

5. Every map should have a small explanatory text (on
the other side or as an inset): state boundaries under
suchand-such a treaty (when approved and ratified).
Autonomous regions established on such-and-such a date. The
population of the gubernias and the chief cities, in
accordance with the census of August 1920. Etc.

6. On account of a ludicrous oversight, the old numeration

    

of the maps has been taken, i.e., left: No. X—Moscow,
No. XII—the Crimea, and others!! There should be a new
numeration.

7. Neither the Tatar Republic nor the Bashkirian Republic
are given in full in No. XIV. They should be given in full.
The same applies to all autonomous regions. The national
make-up of the autonomous regions should be given
according to the latest data (in the explanatory text).

8. Of the old maps these have been omitted:


Saratov and the surrounding gubernias


Simbirsk, Penza and the surrounding gubernias


Rostov-on-Don and the surrounding gubernias


Smolensk and the surrounding gubernias
(Byelorussia)


The Ukraine on the right bank of the Dnieper


The Caucasus (the boundaries of all the new
republics must be shown without fail).

The Atlas must be a full one. All the gubernias should
be there. An incomplete atlas is of no use at all, and the
specimen copy is outrageously incomplete.

9. Instead of additions (in bold type) below and in the
margin: the distance by rail (this is taken from the old
atlas)—there should be short distances not only by rail.

10. Add: a map with the plan for electrification (from
the book Plan for Electrification Submitted to the Eighth
Congress of Soviets).

11. Add a map of institutions of higher learning
(universities, etc.) and educational establishments by gubernias
(at least on the strength of the information already available).

12. Add: a map of radio stations.

13. Historical maps (the two new ones at the end) are
no good. Incomplete. They contain mistakes. Instead of
these two, there should be:

(a) one of the same size: a historical map of Soviet Russia.

Front lines by date (for instance: V.1918; XII.1918;

V or VI.1919; XI or XII.1919; I and XI 1920)
with these remarks: the names of the fronts on the
given date.

The state boundary of the whole of the R.S.F.S.R.
and of all the neighbouring republics (which had been
within the empire).
 

(b) A map of the whole of the R.S.F.S.R. with Siberia,
even if of small size, on one
map.[1]

{{

Copies: Bryukhanov, People’s Commissariat for Food
Milyutin, Supreme Economic Council

In view of the extreme urgency of the question of
measures to combat the drought, please at once call a
conference of representatives of the People’s Commissariats
concerned, so as to have a draft decree tabled, in elaborated
and agreed form, at the Council of Labour and Defence
not later than Wednesday, 27.IV.1921.

Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On April 27, 1921, the C.L.D. discussed a draft decision on
measures to combat the drought, tabled by Deputy People’s
Commissar for Agriculture I. A. Teodorovich. The three general points
of the draft decision were adopted, it being decided that the other
points, relating to concrete practical measures, should be
immediately discussed with the departments concerned, and approved at
the next C.L.D. sitting. On April 29, the C.L.D. adopted the
whole decision. Us first point emphasised: “To recognise the
struggle against the drought as being of primary importance for
the country’s agricultural life and measures taken in that
direction as highly urgent” (Izvestia VTsIK No. 95, May 5, 1921).

25/IV.1921. 

Comrade Hanecki:   

Two of my secretaries are going to see you in Riga:

1) Anna Petrovna Kizas and

2) Natalya Stepanovna Lepeshinskaya.

I have worked with both for several years. They are
remarkably loyal. Working for me has been hard labour.

    

No rest or holiday. They are quite tired out. They must
be given a rest. Please, pay them their salary in advance
(and give them more) and then don’t make them work.
Give them a chance to rest, see the doctor and have some
wholesome food.

Greetings,

Yours,


Lenin

26.IV.1921

Comrades Bryukhanov


Kritsman


Tomsky or his deputy (Andreyev?)


Potyaev

In view of the urgent question of promoting the
fisheries campaign, I request you to call today, if possible at
once, a conference to discuss the proposals of Comrade
Potyaev
(Glavryba[1]

)

and with his participation. The
composition of the conference: People’s Commissariat for Food,
Commission for Utilisation, All-Russia Central T.U.C. and
Comrade Potyaev. Report in C.P.C.
today.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Central Administration of the Fishing Industry.—Ed,—Lenin
 



[2]
At the C.P.C. sitting on April 26, 1921, the report on promoting
the fisheries campaign was given by Deputy People’s Commissar
for Food, N. P. Bryukhanov. The C.P.C. decisions ensured
the swift movement of goods for the Central Administration of
the Fishing Industry (Glavryba) and authorised it (with the
knowledge of the People’s Commissariat for Food) to refer its problems
directly to the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. A commission, consisting of
representatives of the People’s Commissariat for Food, the
All-Russia Central T.U.C., the Central Union of Consumers’ Societies,
the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade and Glavryba, was
set up to examine the question of developing the fishing industry
and drawing up a plan for a fish procurement campaign.

26.IV.1921 

Comrade Gorbunov:

I must call your attention to the extreme disorder in
our office. The attached telephone message shows that it

    

was sent out on 24/IV (hour?)


and received at 11.25 on 25.IV.


(i.e., the telephone message took 11 hours to arrive!)


I received it


at 12.00 on 26/IV.


This is most outrageous!

I propose that you should conduct right away a full
and thorough investigation to find out who is to blame,
and give me the facts. The office routine should be
reviewed and renewed.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

Comrade Lezhava:

Georgia is of exceptional importance as a cover for
Russia’s foreign trade. This is convenient also for Italy,
and Germany, and America.

1) Find a brainy fellow to be sent there on behalf of
the People’ s Commissariat for Foreign Trade. Do it as fast
as you can! 

2) Have a more detailed talk about this with Stalin.
Do this today.

3) Drop me a couple of lines on the results.

We need a plan (and a fund) for foreign trade via Batum.

You have no foreign trade plan. You are allowing a
lot of waste and letting others do the same. I am going
to fight you.

Here’s your line: not a kopek more for foodstuffs or for
fuel in 1921. Draw up a plan on this line, and do not
succumb to “pressures” or “influences”.

Lenin

30/IV. 

Comrade Trotsky:

I have read Shatunovsky’s pamphlet, White Coal and
Revolutionary
Petrograd.[1]

Very weak. Nothing but rhetoric. Not the least bit of
sound matter.

The only business-like hint is on page 15:

“Outstanding hydraulics specialists believe it will take
no more than eight months to see the real fruits of this
great endeavour.”

Who is a specialist? We have none (I have asked
Krzhizhanovsky: there are none). Shatunovsky has undertaken
to write of what he knows nothing about (that’s
Krzhizhanovsky’s assessment). Apart from this unsubstantiated
remark, there’s nil in the whole pamphlet.

Let Shatunovsky give proof and set out business
proposals. Otherwise, the idle talk remains what it is.

Yours,
Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin sent G. M. Krzhizhanovsky Y. M. Shatunovsky’s pamphlet
on April 24, 1921. On the cover Lenin wrote: “Comrade
Krzhizhanovsky! Your opinion? Return with your opinion. I shall send
it to Zinoviev.” On p. 14, Lenin marked off these words: “To
have electric power within a few months in order to start the
remaining plants”, and made this remark: “This looks like the gist.
How many mouths? How much power? Is this possible in
practice?” On p. 15, Lenin marked off the author’s words about the
opinion of hydraulics specialists arid wrote: “Which? When and
where has this been printed?” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee.)
On the question of possible measures to restore the economy
of Petrograd, Lenin sent an inquiry to the Chairman of the

   

Petrograd Soviet, G. Y. Zinoviev, on May 3 (see this volume,
Document 147).

Comrade Zinoviev:

This shows that Trotsky is in a highly scrappy mood.
Shatunovsky’s pamphlet is pure twaddle. Return this to
me with a note about your decisions and plans on this
matter.[2]

3/V. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on L. D. Trotsky’s letter, in which, replying to Lenin’s
letter of April 30, 1921 (see this volume, Document 146), he tried
to stand up for Shatunovsky’s pamphlet, White Coal and
Revolutionary Petrograd. Lenin made a number of remarks on Trotsky’s
letter (see Lenin Miscellany XX, pp. 208–09).





[2]
In reply to Lenin’s inquiry, G. Y. Zinoviev informed him on
May 5 about the decision to suspend construction on the Svir,
concentrating all the efforts on completing the operations on the
Utkina Zavod sector in 1921, and not stopping construction on
the Volkhov under any circumstances.

Comrade Zinoviev:

I have been informed that 

1) Gintsburg, the sculptor working on Plekhanov’s bust,
is in need of materials, clay, etc.;

2) the graves of Plekhanov and Zasulich are neglected.
Could you issue orders on both points to have the things
seen to, pressed forward and
verified?[1]

Salut!

Notes
 
 



[1]
In reply to this note, Lenin was informed that the graves of
G. V. Plekhanov and Vera Zasulich had been put in order, and
that the Public Works Committee promised to supply the
sculptor I. Y. Gintsburg with the gypsum required for his work on a
monument to Plekhanov.

On July 16, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee decided to render assistance in setting up a monument
to Plekhanov, and gave N. A. Semashko an assignment to
arrange this with the Petrograd Soviet.

Aren’t you ashamed to vote for printing 5,000 copies
of Mayakovsky’s “150,000,000”?

It is nonsense, stupidity, double-dyed stupidity  and
affectation.[1]
 

I believe such things should be published one in ten,
and not more than 1,500 copies, for libraries and cranks.

As for Lunacharsky, he should be flogged for his
futurism.

6/V.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The poem “150,000,000” had signs of V. V. Mayakovsky’s early    

futuristic trend: it was written in a mannered style and cast in          

a complicated form; he denied the classical heritage and extolled         

futurism as the only literary trend consonant with the times.

Comrade Pokrovsky:

Again and again, I request you to help us fight
futurism, etc.

1) Lunacharsky has (alas!) got through the collegium the
printing of Mayakovsky’s “150,000,000”.

Can’t we stop this? It must be stopped. Let’s agree that
these futurists are to be published not more than twice
a year and not more than 1,500 copies.

2) They say that Lunacharsky has once again driven out
Kiselis, who is reputed to be a “realist” artist, while
directly and indirectly promoting a futurist.

Could you find some reliable anti-futurists?

I think this should go to the press, but only with a

otherwise our editors will make a hash of things. Either write
such a commentary yourself, or get someone else to do
it, but with your
supervision.[1]

Notes

Written on a press bureau bulletin of May 6, 1921, under a report
from the French newspaper L’Echo de Paris of May 1. The author
of the item. Dr. Legendre, who had visited the major industrial
centres of China and Japan, reported on the situation in the Far
East and on the danger of a spread of Bolshevik influence in
Eastern Asia.

Sending the bulletin on to G. V. Chicherin, Lenin made this
remark: “See p. 2” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).


In connection with Lenin’s instructions, Izvestia VTsIK No. 99
of May 10, 1921, carried on article entitled “The Fears of the

Comrade Smolyaninov:

I should like to draw your attention to Belyakov’s
article on the Narofominsk Textile
Mill[1] (in Izvestia? or
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn? the other day). Collect all earlier
polemics on this. Go into it. Study the facts. Let me know
the results.

This seems to be an important business.

A reference to A. A. Belyakov’s article, “No Progress”, in
Izvestia VTsIK No. 95 of May 5, 1921, saying that because of red
tape and delays, the Narofominsk Textile Mill, started in
February 1921, was not supplied with fuel and ran only for one month.
The author spoke of the need to restart it as soon as possible.

V. A. Smolyaninov recalled later that as a result of the
measures taken by the C.P.C. Managing Department, he reported
to Lenin the following day that the fuel had been delivered and
the mill was running.

You deserve a beating.

1) You are late with the grain order. We are in a pretty
horrible position.

2) You have failed to make use of all the sources
(Sweden, etc., even if only for small quantities).

3) There is no precise information: what can be
obtained nearby, even at a very high price, and in very small
quantities.

Make a special point of putting all this right at the
People’s
Commissariat.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In reply to this note, L. B. Krasin sent Lenin P. L. Voikov’s
memo on the food which could he quickly purchased abroad for
gold and on credit. Krasin added the following: “There is nothing
in Sweden, Denmark, and Holland. Tsyurupa told me that the
grain would be needed in June. The ‘catastrophic’ nature of the
requirement is usually discovered at the very last moment”
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Lenin crossed out Krasin’s note, and on May 10, 1921, sent
the document on to N. P. Bryukhanov (for Lenin’s markings
on the memo see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p. 234).

On May 10, Voikov drew up the memo on the distribution of
food and consumer goods bought abroad by C.L.D. decision. On
the back of this memo Lenin wrote:

“Into the file on the purchase of food abroad. (Give me daily
reminders)” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Code 

Sovgovdel, London

The warrant for two million poods of grain issued to
you must be started on at once. Buy the nearest even if
small consignments wherever you can, without stinting the

    

price. You are free to buy any other food products and,
tinned stuffs under this warrant. Can anything be received
from Canada right away? You may pay a moderate bonus
for speedy delivery at Baltic ports. May
10.[2]

Enter on C.P.C. agenda, sending a copy to Bryukhanov
at once (if he has not yet got it) or giving him this copy
until tonight—to obtain his opinion. We must rob the
others but give these what they ask.

10/V. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is written on a report to the C.P.C. from Y. A.
Preobrazhensky, Chief of the Central Administration for Vocational
Training under the People’s Commissariat for Education, who pointed
out that a reduction, under the C.P.C. commission’s decision,
in the number of rations for his administration during the spring
and summer months of 1921 down to 110,000, would result in a
closure of classes at many educational establishments, and asked
the C.P.C. to increase the number of rations.

Comrade Molotov:

Do you know whether at any time there has arisen the
question of setting apart from among the membership of
the R.C.P. 

those of them who do not take part in administration,
hold no command, administrative, government in general,
trade union, co-operative posts, no posts at all, 
 

i.e., that section of the R.C.P. membership which is
engaged exclusively in ideological work, agitation and
propaganda, outside of any administrative posts.

Could this be done? Should not this be done?

The fact is that the Party suffers terribly from the
abominable sh.. of our administrative apparatus. Perhaps,
we should keep them apart in any voting or count the votes
separately?[1]

11/V. 

Comrade Bryukhanov:

I am sending you the coded
message.[1] Read it
carefully, make a note of the figures and return to me.

You will have to draw up a precise plan of use, i.e.,
allocation of imported products from May 15 to June 15.
St. Petersburg and Moscow at the top of the list.
This plan should be reviewed after every cable of any
sizable purchases.

Send me the first such plan.

Fish, as follows.

French beans (have you decided?), as follows.

Wheat, as follows.

Think about what could go into the press by way of
reassurance.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Top secret 

Comrade Kursky, People’s Commissariat for Justice

A petition No. 8086, dated 10.V.1921, enclosed in copy,
has been received at the C.L.D. from the representative
extraordinary for the supply of the Red Army and Navy,
revealing strictly confidential information on the numerical
strength of the Army. With a better choice of wording,
the petition could have avoided giving information on the
numerical strength of the Army. Besides, the
correspondence did not arrive in a secret envelope or by messenger
but was sent by post. As a result it was opened at the
inregister of the managing department, and could have been
made public in transit through the post.

Please conduct an
inquiry.[1]

17.V.1921. 

Comrade Litkens:

In view of the appointment of a “New broom” to
Tsentropechat,[1]
[2]

an effort should be made to establish precise
administrative responsibilities:

1) lay down most precisely in writing the
responsibilities of the head of Tsentropechat and the gubernia heads,

2) ditto, in respect of the library network:

(a) general state (Public and Rumyantsev) libraries

(b) gubernia

(c) uyezd

(d) volost libraries (unless it is too early, unless you
have decided to confine yourself to uyezd libraries
for the time being)...

3) you (and we) must be absolutely sure whom we are to
jail (both from Tsentropechat and the library network;
from both institutions without fail), if within one month
(2 weeks? 6 weeks?) after the publication of every Soviet
book it is not available at every library. Send me a short
report on this.

Comrade Frunze

Copies to Comrades Petrovsky and Rakovsky


and the Ukrainian
C.P. C.C.[1]

18.V.1921

Comrade Bukharin says the crop in the south is
excellent.
 

The main question for the whole of Soviet power, a
lifeand-death question for us, is to collect 200–300 million
poods in the Ukraine.

The main requirement for this is salt. Everything should
be taken over, all the areas of extraction should, be ringed
with a triple cordon of troops, not a pound should be let
through or allowed to be stolen.

This is a matter of life and death.

Put this on a military footing. Appoint persons
specifically responsible for each operation. Let me have a list of
them (everything through the Central Salt Administration).

You are the Commander-in-Chief of salt.

The responsibilities are all
yours.[2]

Comrade Molotov:

On the strength of the complaint 

I propose that Bryukhanov should send a telegram
today, signed by the Chairman of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee and a C.C. secretary:

1) severe reprimand to the heads (chairmen of the
gubernia executive committees, etc.), 

2) threat of prosecution, 

3) prosecution at once of those responsible for local
issues before meeting central requirements.

Serebrovsky,

19.V.1921

I have read your garrulous telegram to
Sergo.[1]
Keep your reports short and more precise, state how
much food and clothing you are getting for the workers
of Baku. It is absurd to increase the number of workers
so long as a smaller number of them have yet to be provided
with food and clothing.

1) Comrade Nogin, Central Textile Administration


2) Comrade Bryukhanov, People’s Commissariat for Food

19/V.

Rakovsky phoned to complain that the promised
piecegoods are not being supplied. He says that in Nikolayev
the peasants are willing to exchange grain for piece-goods.
Please phone at once to clear up everything, apart from
official inquiry, and have them get on with it, sending, me
the names of the persons responsible both at the People’s
Commissariat ,for Food and at the Central Textile
Administration. Who is responsible for the shipment of the
piecegoods? This is a disgraceful and criminal

V. P. Nogin and B. P. Pozern reported that even before the C.L.D.
decision, Trekhgornaya Textile Mill had been ordered to prepare
two million arshins of piece-goods for shipment to the Ukraine,
but that the People’s Commissariat for Food had failed to supply
the packing material.

On May 23, having obtained from V. I. Velman, who
was responsible for the Central Textile Administration,
detailed explanations for reasons of the delay, Lenin,
wrote to V. A. Smolyaninov: “Look into this and check up.
23/V. Lenin” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee). On May 31, Lenin
demanded that the strictest supervision should be established over
the most rapid movement by rail of the piece-goods sent to the
Ukraine (see this volume, Document 184).

Assignment to Comrade Smolyaninov,


Assistant Business Manager of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D.

1) Keep in touch with regional economic conferences and
follow their work from the telegrams, material and minutes
coming in from them, informing the C.L.D. Chairman at
regular intervals about the results of their work and their
fulfilment of C.L.D. assignments, and also giving them,
with Comrade Lenin’s knowledge or by agreement with
the People’s Commissariats concerned, explanations or
instructions on any questions that may arise.

2) Look through the minutes and material of gubernia
economic conferences from the standpoint of verification of
execution of C.L.D. resolutions and general directives,
closely following the work of the most important and typical
gubernia economic conferences, a list of which is to be
submitted for Comrade Lenin’s approval.

3) Keep in touch with the work of the collegium of
economic People’s Commissariats,
Gosplan[1]

and planning
commissions, set up by C.L.D. decision.

4) Follow the country’s economic life from newspapers,
reports and special publications by economic and statistical
bodies.

5) Follow the actual execution of the most important
decisions and assignments of the C.L.D., and report on
this to Comrade Lenin.

6) Carry out special assignments from the C.L.D.
Chairman and the C.P.C. business manager on economic,
administration and production matters.

7) Put the final touches to economic, administration and
production questions coming up for the C.L.D. agenda,
which are not sufficiently well prepared.

8) On your own initiative, with Comrade Lenin’s
consent, prepare and raise through the appropriate People’s
Commissariats or through the C.L.D. directly, the
questions which arise from the material studied.

To enable Comrade Smolyaninov to carry out these

On February 2, No. 785/y&whatthe. I Sent you, through
Gorbunov,[1]

Comrade Kotlyarov’s letter, containing the
proposal that idle lifts and all their equipment in the big

    

cities should be used by the mining industry, with the   following resolution:

“We should make inquiries and find out whether anything
can be done in this case to help the mining industry. Take
away what can be spared.” The documents at the S.E.C.
show that 5 commissions have worked on the assignment:

1) Conference at the
Prodrasmet[2]

on the use of lift   equipment by the Donbas (February 11).

2) A special commission for the examination of lifts in   houses (worked until February 23).

3) A technical conference of specialists under the Metals
Technical Department (roughly about March 22–24).

4) A conference at the Mining and Technical Department
of Central Coal Administration (April 16) on the question
of using lifts in the city of Moscow and other big cities
for mining purposes in the coal industry and, finally,

5) A meeting of the Central Production Commission on
April 22, minutes 321, § 238.

Commission No. 3 had already quite clearly established
that the lift equipment could unquestionably be used in
part for the mining industry. However, nothing-has yet
been done in practice; this business is being dragged out
endlessly and to no purpose.

I propose that the question should be raised in the
Council of Labour and Defence on May 25, with a draft
resolution of roughly this content:

“To authorise the S.E.C. Presidium, by co-ordination
with the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, to
make use of parts of lifts in Moscow, Petrograd and other
big cities, which ,are suitable for the mining industry,
such as: winches, drums and cables.

“Parallel to this, the necessary tests should be made
for using the lift equipment in conformity with the minutes
of the March 24, 1921 conference at the Technical Section
of the Metals Department, designating these tests, in view
of their importance, as having top priority.”

I add[3]

(a) Appoint a responsible person.
 

(b) Punish for red tape (from March to May).
Report to N. P.
Gorbunov.[4]

On May 25, 1921, the C.L.D. adopted Lenin’s draft resolution,         

with small amendments, and instructed the People’s Commissariat       

for Justice “to carry out an inquiry and punish those guilty of      

the red tape, owing to which the assignment to the Presidium of       

the S.E.C., issued by the Chairman of the Council of People’s         

Commissars on February 2, 1921, through the C.P.C. business           

manager under No. 785/yII, remains virtually unfulfilled to this      

day” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism

Iv. Iv. Radchenko, Central Peat Administration
from Lenin

Comrade Radchenko:

Here is an example of how you ignore my advice.

You sent in the papers on Shatura, in a great sheaf,
On 14/IV. There were no clear-cut proposals written out
separately.

I was busy and was not able to read them; they were
pickled until 23/V.

All this while you kept silent!

This is outrageous!

You should have appended two papers:

a) We request the closure of the
“Politbureaus”,[1]

because
they are utterly useless (five lines). Adding that
the documents had been sent to Lenin.

b) We request that the telegram (or the telephone
message) should be signed: Why the 2 (4) boilers have
not been issued, give reasons, do not allow red tape.
Lenin.

Then, both these papers in copies to Fotieva, for her
to give me a reminder.

Then we should have something done, and I might have
signed them on 15 or 16/IV.

That is the only practice to follow in future.
 

It is not hard to enclose two or three papers containing
five lines each, with copies to Fotieva. You must draw
the business conclusions yourself, instead of making me
extract five lines of business conclusions from dozens of
pages.

Read this out to Winter and send me his and your
receipts stating that both of you have understood these
instructions and will act on them.

23/V.1921. Lenin

Commission; in this case, a reference to such a body at the Shatura

Comrade Fotieva:

You are clearly to blame for this business of the
Shatura (No. 3 in folder).

Received on 14 / IV. 

Today is 23 / V.

You have pickled it, without giving a reminder either
to me or to Smolyaninov.

We can’t have that sort of thing.

There must be no pickling. You must either read things
yourself or ask Smolyaninov or Gorbunov to do so.

Please pass on this assignment to Smolyaninov now,
using one of my letterheads:

α) verify at once whether anything has been done (by
phone).

β) If not, at once set the thing going officially, letting
me sign the business papers,

aa) dissolution of the “Politbureaus”,

bb) issue of 2(-4?) boilers (-?),
etc.[1]

23/V. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On May 24, 1921, V. A. Smolyaninov, on Lenin’s instructions,     

sent a telephone message to I. S. Unschlicht and a letter to      

V. M. Molotov at the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee requesting      

speedier examination of the question of the “Politbureau” at    

the Shatura construction site.

Comrade Klasson:

I have received and read your paper of
20/V.1921.[1]
I can hardly see you one of these days, as I am too busy.

Give a reminder to Fotieva, C.P.C. secretary, in one or
two weeks’ time.

In substance: your letter has surprised me. Usually such
complaints come from the workers, who do not know how
to fight red tape. But what about yourself? What about
Starkov? Why didn’t either you or Starkov write me in
good time? Why has Starkov, who has been in Germany
for months, not written to me a single time?? I think he
should be penalised for that.

Why is it that he and you merely “lamented”, without
proposing any precise changes, such as having the C.P.C.
(or,the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade or someone
else) adopt some decision. (To refrain from demanding of
all the factories, etc.)

The question now is fully settled, isn’t it?

(Has the Central Peat Administration already taken a  -2 decision?)

Regards,

Lenin

Enclosed in R. E. Klasson’s letter to Lenin of May 20, 1921,
was a brief report on his trip abroad on Gidrotorf business (see

company.

Klasson spoke about the red tape and delays at the Russian
railway mission in Berlin which had been assigned the
formalisation of orders for Gidrotorf.

24.V.1921 

Comrade Bokii:

I have received your telephone message. Absolutely
dissatisfied.[2]
 

That’s not right.

You must investigate the affair in detail and let me
have precise information, and not just “a look and
something”; you say “exaggerated” ... “it is impossible to stop
the stealing altogether” (??!!)

It’s not a report, it’s an outrage.

1) Give me the names of all the persons responsible;

2) describe how the business is organised;

3) list the cases of stealing

all of them, precisely;


the time; the amount.

4) How many staffs altogether?


(their rough composition? working records? etc.)

5) What measures are being specifically taken there to
stop the stealing?


State measures precisely.

6) Give date of trial and state punishment imposed
there (IV. 1920?)? List all cases of major trials. How many
have been punished?

Inform me of your receipt of this and the date of
fulfilment.[3]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 

[1]
On the letter Lenin wrote: “To Fotieva: this is confidential, 
 keep a copy.”—Ed.
 



[2]
On May 16, 1921, a worker of Gokhran (State Depository of
Valuables of the R.S.F.S.R.), Y. M. Yurovsky, told Lenin about
cases of theft of valuables at Gokhran. Making a note of this,
Lenin, the same day, instructed a member of the All-Russia Cheka
Collegium, G. I. Bokii, to carry out a strict inquiry.

In a telephone message on May 23 (in reply to which, the
present letter was written), Bokii alleged that Yurovsky’s
information was highly exaggerated and that measures were being taken
together with the All-Russia Cheka to bring the stealing at
Gokhran down to a minimum. Lenin’s remark on the telephone
message says: “Give me a reminder.”

Lenin subsequently returned to the matter repeatedly (see this
volume, Documents 180, 205, 216 and 221, and Lenin Miscellany
XXXVI, pp. 288, 298, 370, 403–05).





[3]
On May 28, 1921, G. I. Bokii submitted to Lenin a detailed
report about the state of affairs at Gokhran—the personnel,
structure, cases of stealing and a list of court cases at Gokhran. The
report proposed some measures to improve the work and prevent
stealing. On May 29, Lenin sent this report, together with his
covering letter, to Deputy People’s Commissar for Finance,
A. O. Alsky (see this volume, Document 180).

N.B.

1) Give this to Smolyaninov to
read.[1]

2) Find out what industries and enterprises and staffs
(how many? and where?) there are in this uyezd.

3) Enter on C.P.C. or C.L.D. agenda in connection with
the C.C. resolution of
10.V.1921.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a resolution on the new rating policy adopted on
May 11, 1921, by the Seventh Skopin (Ryazan Gubernia) Uyezd
Trade Union Conference.

It slated that the inefficient distribution of manpower and
the low labour productivity were one of the main reasons
hampering economic rehabilitation in Skopin Uyezd. A switch to
collective supply of workers and employees was proposed as one of
the measures to remove these shortcomings. The conference
delegates were instructed to stand up for the propositions set
out in the resolution at the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Trade
Unions.





[2]
On May 10, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee rejected the draft decision moved by Y. Larin (S.E.C.)
and A. Z. Holtzmann (All-Russia Central T.U.C.) on collective
supply of workers and employees at some stale enterprises, and
proposed that it should be reworked and brought up at the C.P.C.
The draft Politbureau decision was written by Lenin (see Lenin
Miscellany XXIII, p. 142). It scums that in connection with the
discussion of this matter in the C.P.C., V. A. Smolyaninov, on
June 14, 1921, sent the resolution of the Skopin Uyezd
Conference to the representative of the All-Russia Central T.U.C. on
the C.P.C. commission on the workers’ supply. On June 14, 1921,
the C.P.C. handed over the reworked draft for the examination
by the C.L.D. On June 17, this was adopted by the C.L.D., on
June 18, it was signed by Lenin, and on June 19, it was published
in Izvestia VTsIK No. 132.

On June 22, the C.L.D. approved the first list of enterprises
to which the decision applied. The factories and enterprises of
Skopin Uyezd were not included.

On this question see also this volume, Documents 208 and 209.

Comrade Molotov:

I have two secretaries (Kizas and Lepeshinskaya) taking
a cure and having a rest in Riga. At my request, Hanecki
helped to make arrangements for them at the
seaside.[1]

This has to be formalised. How? I propose a decision by the
Organising Bureau:
1) either authorising Hanecki to make
arrangements for a holiday in Riga (or Latvia in general)
for persons sent from here by the Orgbureau, or
2)
authorising Hanecki to set up one or two rest homes in Latvia,
with accommodation made available through the
Orgbureau, one-half to go to workers and one-half to
government officials.
The second is better.

What is your opinion?

Comrade Bryukhanov:

The food committees seem to be growing lax, and very
considerably, too.

This is absolutely intolerable.

Discipline must be tightened up to the utmost, and
at once, otherwise we shall never be rid of the famine.

1) The People’s Commissariat for Food must designate
the responsible persons in the gubernias and in the uyezds,
to know who is to go to jail
(1) the uyezd commissar for
food?
2) the chairman of the uyezd executive committee?

3) the uyezd military commissar?? There should be at least
three responsible persons).
 

2) Not a single violation (such as taking for the
localities what is earmarked for the centre) should be allowed
to go without the arrest of the guilty (through the
AllRussia Central Executive Committee).

You keep writing long papers with
complaints,[2] rather:
with wails, instead of business proposals:


||| 

“authorise the All-Russia C.E.C. to arrest the persons
concerned for failing to carry out orders resulting in
famine at the centre.”

That is the kind of proposal the People’s Commissariat
for Food should bring up in the Politbureau.

3) A similar campaign of relentless arrests of members
of local gubernia food committees, etc., should be started
right away for negligence, failure to make due preparations,
etc.

The People’s Commissariat for Food will be held
responsible for the unprepared state of the apparatus and
for its lack of dispatch.

26/V.1921.

Comrade Khalatov:

I must state with deep regret that there has been no
improvement in the running of the Allocation
Administration of the People’s Commissariat for Food.

There is the same old chaos of figures.

The raw figures have got hold of you, instead of the
other way round.

You have given me a heap of figures, heaps of
undigested raw material.

On the same day we have the Muscovites coming and
wailing: not the slightest improvement.

I call up Bryukhanov and Svidersky. They bring along
Vyshinsky. He gave these figures:
 

in 8 days (18–25.V) Moscow has received 165 carloads
(excluding oats).

165:8==20 5/8. The Muscovites say: we’ve not been
getting even 18 regularly.

Furthermore: for five days, 26–31, there will be (says
Vyshinsky) 90 of grain+63 of oats. The Muscovites say: we
cannot handle more than 1,000 [poods] of oats a day!!!


!!|| 
This means there is actually a worsening:


26–31.V


as compared with 18–25.VI!!! 


!!|| 
A worsening instead of the improvement you promised:


there were 20 5/8 of grain,


there will be 18 of grain+1(?) of
oats (?).[2]

I repeat my request: non multa sed
multum.[1]

Fewer
figures, but more matter.

Why not take grain alone? Only grain, without the oats.
But precisely: how much Moscow is to get a day.
Concentrate on that.

Lenin
 

Notes

Not many, but much.—Ed.
 



[2]
At the Central Party Archives there is a note giving information
about the actual supply of grain to the Moscow Consumers’
Cooperatives from May 18 to 25, 1921. It contains calculations,
apparently made by Lenin during the report by A. Y. Vyshinsky,
Chief of the Allocation Administration of the People’s
Commissariat for Food, and included in this letter.

28.V.1921

Check up with the utmost precision:

how much work exactly has been done (what part has
been finished); 

how much material, rails, etc., foodstuffs, etc., has
actually been transported to the spot; where they are; the
conditions in which all these materials and the delivered
Âthings are stored; the conditions and the concrete
possibilities of returning all these materials, rails and all the rest,
without losses, without stealing, or with minimum
losses; the proportion of the possible and probable losses; 
 

it is the most important task to carry out this
on-thespot assessment circumstantially and to verify it precisely.

With this problem solved, with the exact data in hand,
a conclusion should be drawn up on the substance of the
matter: is the “Algemba” construction to be stopped (if
yes, how? by what date? etc.) or not to be stopped? and
so on, and so forth.

By phone   

Radek

and Zinoviev

7.50 p.m. 28.V.

I have just received a telegram from Berlin signed by
Zetkin, with the following text:

“Under various pretexts, the Party C.C. has refused
permission for the departure of the delegates authorised
by the opposition, Bra&Bwhatthe and Anna Geyer. That is why
I refuse to go until my associates’ trip is guaranteed.”

I request Radek and Zinoviev to let me know their
opinion by telephone: isn’t it better to advise the Central
Committee to agree to the departure of Bra&Bwhatthe and Anna
Geyer? Or is it better for everyone, including myself, to
say absolutely
nothing?[1]

28/V.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a reply letter, the same day, May 28, 1921, K. B. Radek and
G. Y. Zinoviev advised Lenin to pass on Clara Zetkin’s
telegram to the Comintern Executive Committee. The latter rejected
Clara Zetkin’s demand. Later, after a conference with delegates
from the United Communist Party of Germany to the Third
Congress of the Comintern (before it opened), the Executive sent
the C.C. of the U.C.P.G. a telegram proposing that Anna Geyer
and Otto Bra&Bwhatthe should not be prevented from attending the
congress.

However, the two did not attend the congress. The C.C. of the
U.C.P.G. objected to their going to Moscow, apparently because
they approved the stand of Paul Levi, who had repeatedly
violated Party discipline and had been expelled fro:n the Party by
the C.C. on April 15, 1921 (see Note 119).

29/V.1921. 

Comrade Alsky:

I draw your attention to this report, which has been
submitted to me by a comrade from the All-Russia
Extraordinary Commission, who had been specially authorised by
me, in agreement with Comrade Dzerzhinsky, I appointed the
inquiry which has produced this report after a
communication I had had from the most reliable Communists that
things were not quite well at
Gokhran.[1]

Comrade Bokii’s communication fully confirms this.

I draw your most serious attention to this fact.

You, above all, and then all the members of the
Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Finance, and
Comrade Basha especially, must devote ten times more work to
Gokhran. Unless things are reorganised at Gokhran within
the shortest period in such a way as absolutely to exclude
the possibility of stealing, while at the same time
accelerating all the work and enlarging its scale, the Deputy
People’s Commissar and all the members of the Collegium
of the People’s Commissariat for Finance will be faced
not only with Party, but also with criminal charges.

Because of the delay in the Gokhran work (it is harder
to work in winter and a great deal has to be done before
it sets in), and because of the stealing there, the Republic
is suffering vast losses, for precisely at this time, in these
hard days, we must obtain the maximum of valuables
quickly for commodity exchange with foreign countries.

It is necessary:

1) to organise regular and frequent conferences with
Bokii for the earliest reorganisation of Gokhran;

2) to bring the protection and surveillance to perfection
(special railings, wooden partitions; lockers or partitions
for changing; surprise searches; systems of double and
triple surprise check-ups in accordance with all the rules
of the art of criminal investigation, etc., etc.);

3) to recruit, in case of necessity, dozens and hundreds
of responsible and absolutely honest Communists in Moscow

    

to participate (say, once a month or two months) in
surprise, day and night, audits. The staffs and the inspectors
must be given instructions in the minutest detail;

4) it shall be the duty of every member of the P.C.F.
Collegium, without exception, to conduct in person, at least
once a month, day and night surprise inspections of
Gokhran, at the work places and wherever else stealing may
occur. The Deputy People’s Commissar shall keep a
personal secret register of these inspections.

In view of the secret character of this paper, I request
you to return it to me at once, and to have all the members
of the P.C.F. Collegium sign it in person.

29/V V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

(P.S. If Chutskayev is still here, let him read it as well:
he bears a considerable part of the blame!)

30.V.

Comrade Lutovinov:

I have read your letter of 20/V, arid it has left me with
a very sad impression. I expected that in Berlin, having
had a rest, having recovered from your illness, having taken
a look “from outside” (you always get a clearer view from
outside), and having thought things out, you would arrive
at clear-cut and exact conclusions. Over here, you were
in a “mood” of dissatisfaction. A mood which was almost
unconscious, a blind feeling, not resulting from thought.
So I expected you to have clear-cut and exact conclusions
instead of the mood. Perhaps, I thought, We would differ
over the conclusions, but these would still be clear-cut and
exact conclusions drawn by one of the “founders” of the
“opposition” (as you admit yourself to be in your letter).

Your letter leaves a sad impression because, instead

    

of clarity and precision, there is again this dark mood with
the addition of “tough words”.

You must not allow this.

Facts—you will recall this yourself—are stubborn things.
So have a look at what are the facts you mention. I list
all your factual statements:

1) The railwaymen’s C.C. is made up of “old
bureaucrats”.

Is that a fact? The names? I don’t know anyone except
Rudzutak, but I do know that it was made up with care.
There could have been mistakes. They must be corrected.
But for that they should be first pinpointed, so as to leave
no room for any dark moods (and the gossip which
frequently lurks in this darkness: gossip loves darkness and
anonymity).

You have not given any names. There are no facts.

Rudzutak? What’s wrong with him as a worker? “He is
physically worn-out”? Is there anyone among us who isn’t?
We shall get him back from Turkestan as soon as we put
Joffe and Sokolnikov back on their feet.

What then does our “tendentious factionalism” consist
of? Is it the fact that a supporter of the Party congress
majority is put at the head of the railwaymen’s C.C.? Is
that what you call “factionalism”? If that is so, please
explain to me what meaning should be given to
factionalism and to the Party spirit.

Surely you will not declare that it was acting in the
“Party spirit” for the leader of the former Workers’
Opposition to introduce a C.C. list at the Metalworkers’
Congress a few days ago, where of the 22 R.C.P. members, 19
are supporters of the old Workers’
Opposition?[1] If that
is not “tendentious factionalism”, if that is not reviving
the faction, then I must say that you have been using the
concept of factionalism in a most specific way, most
unusually, even out of the human context.

2) You say that at the head of the All-Russia Central
T.U.C. there is a “physically worn-out person”, i.e.,
Tomsky? He was to have been replaced by a trio of secretaries,
and has now been removed altogether. Thus, your shot
at factionalism has ricocheted against you. There’s already
a fact for you.
 

3) In your struggle against the outrages of the Berlin
mission you have come up against “fierce resistance from
Moscow all the way up to Ilyich”.

You will pardon me if I say that this is an
invention.

You gave excessive praise to Stomonyakov, who was
defended by Krasin. Kopp was at the head of the old
mission. Kopp was removed, Stomonyakov has remained.

What is this? Is it “fierce resistance from Moscow”?

Or is it a fierce lie about Moscow?

In the light of the “facts”, which of these tough words
is closer to the truth? What about that?

There have been scandalous practices at the Berlin
mission, Moscow (and Krasin) did not hamper or resist you,
but helped you to combat them, by giving more authority
to Stomonyakov, whom you extolled most decidedly.

4) You say you have discovered there, in Berlin, a
number of the “most brazen scoundrels and thieves”, and
Moscow has not removed them.

Their names? There is not a single one.

Is that a fact or a piece of gossip?

Perhaps you are not aware of the way complaints are
addressed to the C.C.? to the Orgbureau? to the
Politbureau? to the C.C. Plenary Meeting?

There has not been a single complaint from you either
in the Politbureau or the Plenary Meeting. There’s a fact
for you.

(In brackets: you and I had a difference over Shklovsky,
but you did not put it before the
Politbureau.[2] I knew
Shklovsky as a Bolshevik for years before the revolution.
Being an honest man, he would have helped you to combat
the “scoundrels and thieves”. But you impeded
Shklovsky’s departure for Berlin, although over here he is not
much of a worker, not doing anything important.)

5) Grzhebin. About him, and only about him, I read
yesterday the protest you and Stomonyakov sent in to the
C.C. We shall examine it at the earliest
sitting.[3]

We in the C.C. have had our differences over Grzhebin.
Some said: he should be removed altogether, because he
might be cheating as a publisher. Others said: as a publisher
he will publish at a lower cost. We prefer to have him cheat

    

us out of 10,000, but put out the cheaper and better
publication.

A commission of both sides equally represented was
elected. I was not on it, because of my “partiality” (some
said) to Gorky, who defended Grzhebin.

The commission decided the case unanimously, I don’t
remember what it decided exactly. I think it was to buy
from Grzhebin if it was cheaper.

Consequently, your conclusion: “they were not guided
by state considerations”, but were trying to pacify Gorky—
is a downright untruth. And you write: “I am sure”!!! What
do you call it when the people work out a “conviction” for
themselves before checking on the facts, which are easily
checked?

6) Lomonosov is a brilliant specialist, but has been
“exposed by Krasin as engaging in the most criminal
commercial transactions”.

That is not true. If Krasin had exposed Lomonosov
committing a crime, Lomonosov would have been removed
and prosecuted. You heard a rumour and turned it into
a piece of scandal.

Krasin wrote me and the C.C.: Lomonosov is a brilliant
specialist, but is less suitable in trade and has made
mistakes. Having come over here, and having met Lomonosov
and examined the documents, Krasin said nothing about
mistakes, let alone crime.

Here is your choice: either to start a serious case in the
Control Commission (or wherever else you wish) about
Lomonosov’s crimes, or to retract the rumour you have so
flippantly picked up.

7) “We are having appointments to the trade department
here of rogues like this one: in the past a manufacturer
whom the Soviet power deprived of all his furs, and he is
now being sent to sell these furs. For pity’s sake, what are
things coming to?”

That is what you write. This is indeed good reason to
feel sad. The founder of the whole opposition reasoning on
such lines!

It’s the same thing as an ignorant muzhik saying: “A
thousand tsarist generals were deprived of their land and
rank, and these generals have now been attached to the Red
    

Army”! Indeed, we have possibly over a thousand of those
who had been generals and landowners under the tsar,
serving in key posts in the Red Army. But it has won.

God will forgive the ignorant muzhik. Who’s going to
forgive you?

If you know that there is a “rogue”, how can you, a
person in office under the Soviet power, hush up his name?
Not start proceedings against this so-and-so?

But if you don’t know his name, it means this is just
another rumour? just another piece of scandal?

I have gone over virtually everything in your letter
that has any semblance at all of being a fact. The result
is an absolute zero.

If I did not know you, then having received such a letter
as yours, I should have said:

either this man has had a nervous breakdown and is
hysterically snatching at scraps of gossip, and is quite
unable to think, reason and verify;

or it is a man who is helpless because of his
backwardness and ignorance, and who has fallen victim to
scandal-mongering;

or it is a disguised Menshevik deliberately engaging in
scandal-mongering.

Because I know you, I say to you that your letter is a
remarkable “human document” which shows how the
“founder of the opposition” has allowed himself to give way to a
desire to play opposition at all costs, and to shout, for
no good reason, about patronage, about stick-in-the-mud
commissars, about the system, etc.

You write: “After all, it is not personalities, but the
system itself that matters. Just now I raise this question:
i$ this the proletariat or a demagnetised, declassed
petty-bourgeois intelligentsia.”

That is ridiculous. In fact, your own letter is a fine
human document showing up the author as a specimen of the
demagnetised petty-bourgeois intelligentsia. For the
professional proletarians have repeatedly yielded up in actual
life demagnetised petty-bourgeois intellectuals, according
to their real class role.

The demagnetised petty-bourgeois intellectual keeps
whimpering and wailing, is put out by any sign of evil

    

or scandalous practice, loses his self-possession, echoes any
piece of scandal, and is all puffed up in his efforts to say
something incoherent about a “system”.

The proletarian (not one by reason of an old profession
but one by his actual class role), when faced with evil,
takes up the fight in a business-like manner: he gives open
and official support to the candidacy of the good worker
Ivan, proposes the removal of the bad Peter, starts a case—
and conducts it vigorously, firmly and to the end—against
the rogue Sidor, against the act of patronage on the part
of Tit, against Miron’s most criminal transaction, and
(after two or three mouths of experience in his new job, and
practical acquaintance with his new environment) works
out business-like and practical proposals: to introduce
such-and-such a system of commissars or political commissars,
to make the following changes in the routine here, and to
assign so many well-known Communists (with the following
record) to the specified posts.

That is the kind of proletarians, who, even after they
have lost their proletarian profession, were able to build
the Red Army and to win with it (despite the thousand
traitors and rogues, of whom thousands still remain among
the military specialists and the military bureaucrats).

That is the kind of proletarians who will never descend
to the class role of the demagnetised petty-bourgeois
intellectuals, thrashing about in impotence, yielding to
scandal, and calling scraps of gossip a “system”.

There you have my frank answer. I can afford to reply
in full once in a while—mostly I haven’t the time to do so.

For old time’s sake, let me tell you this: you need to
do something about your nerves. Then the mood will give
way to reasoning.

With comradely greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to A. G. Shlyapnikov.

The Fourth All-Russia Congress of Metalworkers’ Union was
held in Moscow from May 26 to 30, 1921. The composition of the
C.C. of the Metalworkers’ Union was discussed by the
Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on May 28 and 31,
1921. At the Central Party Archives there is a list of candidates
with Lenin’s remarks and this inscription: “19 of the old Workers’
Opposition.”





[2]
A possible reference to Y. Kh. Lutovinov’s reply to Lenin’s
telegram of May 7, 1921. Lutovinov said that he considered as
incorrect the R.C.P.(B.). C.C. decision to send G. L. Shklovsky
to work in Berlin at the disposal of the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade, and would protest against it.





[3]
In a statement to the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee of May 25,
1921, B. S. Stomonyakov and Y. Kh. Lutovinov protested against
the Politbureau’s decision on the desirability of Z. I. Grzhebin’s,
printing “Vsemirnaya literatura” books in Germany. They said
that the publishing apparatus set up by the R.S.F.S.R. trade
mission in Germany would print the books cheaper than Grzhebin,
who had been artificially raising the prices for Soviet orders.


On this statement, Lenin wrote a note to G. Y. Zinoviev:
“Write me a couple of words: what is the decision of your
commission? Has the C.C. endorsed it?” (This was a reference to the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C. decision on the Grzhebin case. It was approved
by the Politbureau on April 27, 1921.) In reply, Zinoviev wrote:
“The commission was deciding mainly on the past (old orders).
No new assignments have been given. We have agreed only to
have last year’s order completed” (Central Party Archives of the

   

Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

On May 31, the Politbureau examined the statement by
Stomonyakov and Lutovinov, and instructed Zinoviev to send them
the exact text of the commission’s decision on the Grzhebin case
which was approved by the Politbureau, together with his
explanations.

30.V.1921 

Comrade Sklyansky:

On the question of making use of the Army for economic
purposes.

This must always be borne in mind.

A systematic plan for such use should be thought-out,
prepared and elaborated, and unswervingly
implemented.

Two aspects of this matter stand out especially:

1) the current, most urgent economic works (guarding
and extraction of salt; fuel supply, etc.);

2) the work in implementing the general state-economic
plan over a number of years. The electrification plan for
ten years (the first part of the works) calls for 370 million
working days. This gives an annual (37 : 1.6)—24
working days, i.e., two days a month per armyman.

Of course, a host of difficulties will arise from the
conditions of the Army’s billeting, the transportation to the
place of work, etc., etc., but the Army still can and must
(with the aid of the Universal Military Training Board)
render vast assistance in this matter of electrification. The
Army should be attached to this great
undertaking—ideologically, organisationally and economically—and it
should be an object of systematic effort.

Please raise this question in the Revolutionary
Military Council of the Republic, by reading out this letter.
I should be glad to hear the views of the Council members
or at least to have their short comments on this
question.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On instructions from E. M. Sklyansky, copies of this letter were               

sent to members of the Revolutionary Military Council of the                   

Republic. On June 16, 1921, the R.M.C. decided on the question                 

“Comrade Lenin’s letter on the Army’s labour use” as follows:                

“To suggest to all the members of the R.M.C.R. to submit, within              

a seven-day period, their concrete considerations and proposals in             

writing to the R.M.C.R.” Lenin underlined this decision in the                

minutes of the R.M.C. sitting, and wrote: “Give me a reminder                 

after the C.I. Congress” (Central Party Archives of the Institute    

of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On July 4, 1921, Lenin pointed out that the army’s economic           

work should be taken into account in drawing up the state national    

economic plan (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 497–98).

Comrade Bryukhanov, People’s Commissariat for Food

Copy to Comrade Smolyaninov

There must be a speed-up in the shipment of sacks for
Comrade Vladimirov, Ukraine’s People’s Commissar for
Food, and also the shipment of goods for the Ukrainian
commodity exchange fund. Please notify me of your
subsequent
instructions.[1]

Give me exact information today, and
keep me informed daily, formally and in writing, about
what is being actually done. This is Bryukhanov’s personal
responsibility. Appoint persons responsible for detailed
measures.

Chairman, C.L.D,
 

Notes
 

[1]
The following text is in Lenin’s hand.—Ed.

 



[2]
Written in connection with a complaint of the People’s
Commissar for Food of the Ukraine, M. K. Vladimirov, over the
unsatisfactory supply of the Ukraine with goods and the lack of sacks
which slowed down the procurement of grain in the Ukraine.

On June 1, a telegram signed by Lenin was sent to Vyazniki
(Shuya Uyezd, Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia) on the dispatch
of 500,000 food sacks to the Ukraine by uyezd factories within
a week.

The C.C. decision on responsible travelling personnel
is a decision of the C.C. Plenary Meeting.


This means that it is not to be questioned.


(Personally, I quite agree with it.)


You yourself, I think, must do some of the travelling.

1) The C.C. apparatus should be reinforced and brought
closer to the localities.

2) Your assistants should substitute for you in the
gubernia. The young should be promoted.

3) You can (and will have to) make more frequent
personal visits to Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia to check up,
help, advance candidates in agreement with the Orgbureau,
etc,

4) There is no need to be a theoretician. All you need
to be is a Party man. You are an economic executive. What
we do [need ] is to have economic executives (on behalf
of the C.C.) pull up the localities, verify and instruct.

Comrade Tsyurupa, Deputy Chairman,
P.W.C.[1]

Copies: Comrade Sapronov, Chairman, P.W.C.

 Comrade Bogdanov, Chairman, S.E.C.

Please inform me, in a few very brief lines, whether you
have given exact directives concerning the urgent
completion of the Kashira project (according to the Politbureau
decision),[2] and when. To whom specifically?

Who is personally responsible on the spot for the timely
fulfilment of this?

Is there any need of a special reminder from the centre
or special measures to have this scrupulously done?

(I have personally seen the “gibbet” posts along the

    

Kashira Highway already being toppled to the ground.
This is a bad job. Might this not be the cause of some  fatal
cases?[3])

[2]
A reference to the decision taken by the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on May 10, 1921, to have the
Kashira Electric-Power Station completed by the autumn of that
year.

It was started in February 1919. On April 14, 1919, the Council
of Labour and Defence designated the construction as “work for
the country’s defence and of exceptional importance for the
defence of the rear”.

Lenin attached great importance to the Kashira Electric-Power
Station, and gave constant attention to the progress of building
operations, taking a direct part in solving all the problems,
keeping a check on the supply of the site with the necessary
materials, manpower and equipment (see this volume,
Document 220).





[3]
A reference to the posts for the electric transmission line to run

   

between Kashira and Moscow. V. A. Smolyaninov wrote in his
reminiscences that after Lenin’s note to G. D. Tsyurupa, the
necessary precautionary measures were taken.

Copy: Secretariat of the Council of Labour and Defence

31/V.

In confirmation of the instructions telephoned by the
C.P.C. business manager to Comrade Nikolayev, member
of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Posts
and Telegraphs, I propose that a report should be given in
the Council of Labour and Defence on Wednesday, June 1,
on the time-table for the first section of the radio-telephone
construction (i.e., installation of the radio-telephone
receivers in gubernia and uyezd centres over an area with
a radius of 2,000 versts around Moscow), and that the
agenda for the same day should include all the matters connected
with the radio-telephone construction, namely: transfer of
former Anosov workshop to the People’s Commissariat for
Posts and Telegraphs, supply of radio-telephone works with
bank-notes directly from the centre, etc.

The People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs is
requested to determine precisely the man who will bear
personal responsibility for the timely fulfilment of all the
radio-telephone construction programme now being
submitted for approval by the
C.L.D.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On June 3, 1921, the Council of Labour and Defence decided to
issue to the People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs five
million rubles for the technical facilities required to run a
broadcast newspaper with the aid of loudspeaker telephones in six
Moscow squares.

By its decisions of June 24 and July 6, 1921, the C.L.D. put
the duty on the People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs
to build, by March 1, 1922, four radio telephone transmission
stations (Moscow—Tashkent—Kharkov—Novonikolsk) and 280
gubernia and uyezd receiving stations within 2,000 kilometres
around Moscow.

31.V.1921

Comrade Smilga:

The question of a possible firewood crisis in Moscow
this winter season is of exceptional importance. It is a
question of primary political importance. Moscow must not
receive less fuel in 1921–1922 than in 1920–1921.

This, at all costs.

There is need 1) specially to impose responsibility for
this on Danishevsky;

2) to make a detailed division of this task into component
parts, and assign each part to a special person, precisely
designated;

3) to send more men to work especially for Moscow Fuel
Committee (perhaps you will take Goldberg? later
recruiting Radchenko, even if only for a certain portion of time,
etc.).

4) You personally must make repeated special and
specific check-ups and inspections, and redouble your efforts
to make a good job of it.

Be sure to give me an exact programme of all these
urgent operations and pressures, and inform me of the time.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.L.D.

Comrades Lezhava and Rykov

There must be something wrong over here (and at the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade).
 

After all there must be an entry: what has been  -7 requested?
when? by whom? who approved the order?

It looks as if there is no record. This is total chaos. Time
is running short.

There is an urgent need of the excavators.

Why have they not been ordered in Germany?

in America?

in Sweden?

Whom does Reine
represent?[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
In the left-hand margin Lenin wrote: “[the question of 
-4 excavators].”—Ed.
 



[2]
At the Central Party Archives there is a note from A. M. Lezhava    

to Lenin saying that the purchase of excavators abroad had been     

assigned to L. B. Krasin, but that it was not known what he         

had done. The note added that engineer T. Y. Reine, who had         

been sent abroad by the Mining Council, was authorised to make      

independent purchases for his department.

Krasin

We are in very great need of all kinds of loans, because
the main thing now is to obtain, and moreover at once,
a stock of commodities to exchange for grain with the
peasants The whole policy of the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade must now be subordinated to this immediate
goal.

Comrade Molotov:

In sending you Comrade Vasilyev’s letter to me I ask   you

1) either to arrange the check-up in the Orgbureau (of
the fulfilment of the C.C. assignment to put an end to
Antonov) or to have the C.C. Secretariat carry out this
checkup by studying the documents and summoning Comrade
Sklyansky and also some other person;

2) to send the enclosed secretly and personally to
Comrade Sklyansky for him to read it and return it to me,
adding (to you; a copy for me) what measures of pressure
he has
taken.[2]

With communist greetings,

 Lenin

1/VI.1921.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written in connection with a letter soul to Lenin on
May 12, 1921, by the Petrograd Communist worker V. A.
Vasilyev, who was military commissar of Boguchar Uyezd, Voronezh
Gubernia. He reported that some of those who had taken part
in the mutiny against the Soviet power in Boguchar Uyezd in
November 1920 had escaped and had organised a gang which was
killing Party and government workers. Vasilyev urged the need
to organise a volunteer cavalry unit to fight the bandits, and asked
for three or five motorcycles to arrange liaison.





[2]
On April 27, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee issued a directive to M. N. Tukhachevsky to
liquidate the Antonov bands in Tambov Gubernia within a month.

On Lenin’s assignment Tukhachevsky wrote a report to the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on July 16, 1921, saying that as
a result of the operations carried out from May to July, the kulak
mutiny in Tambov Gubernia had been liquidated, the Soviet
power restored everywhere and that only about 1,200 men were
left in Antonov’s bands, as compared with almost 21,000 at the
beginning of May.

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky,


Gosplan Presidium

There are indications that the C.L.D., in issuing diverse
partial assignments to Gosplan, has not always correctly
allocated these assignments from the standpoint of the
functions exercised by the planning commissions under the
several People’s Commissariats.

In view of this, and also to arrange all Gosplan work
in general in a more purposeful manner, there seems to
be a need to individualise the current work and
responsibility of all Gosplan members.

All Gosplan members, with exemptions to be specially
established in every single case by decisions of its

    

Presidium, shall be given assignments by the Presidium to make
a systematic study of all the material relating to the
exercise of specified economic functions from the standpoint
of rational planning and actual fulfilment of plans (for
example, fuel economies; transportation of fuel;
under-loading on railways; closure of inessential enterprises;
allocation of foodstuffs from the standpoint of their
economies and boosting of labour productivity, etc., etc.).

One and the same assignment may be given to two or
more members, where the interests of the job require a study
and verification of the plan from different angles or by
different methods.

Under such a system, the C.L.D. will interrupt the whole
Gosplan from its general work less frequently with its
particular assignments, and this will also make for more
productive Gosplan operations and for the establishment of
more precise responsibilities of its members.

Please have this proposal put up for discussion by the
Presidium, and inform me of its
decision.[2]

[2]
On June 2 and 3, 1921, the State Planning Commission (Gosplan)
Presidium heard G. M. Krzhizhanovsky’s report on the content
of Lenin’s letter and approved a draft circular to the chairmen

   

of all sections and subcommissions of Gosplan, which was written
by P. S. Osadchy on the strength of Lenin’s proposals. An
extract from the minutes of the Presidium’s sitting was sent to

Make inquiries and let me have precise and exhaustive
answers to the following questions not later than tomorrow:

1) Is it true that arrests were made in Petrograd on May
27 of: Prof. P. A. Shchurkevich (Electrotechnical
Institute), Prof. N. N. Martinovich (University and Oriental
Institute), Prof. Shcherba (University, Professor of
Comparative Linguistics), Prof. B. S. Martynov (University,
Professor of Civil Law), Senior Zoologist A. K. Mordvilko
    

(Academy of Sciences), Prof. Tikhanov’s wife (Institute
of Civil Engineers) and Prof. B. Y. Vorobyov (First
Polytechnical Institute)?

2) Is it true that Prof. Pantelei Antonovich
Shchurkevich is being arrested for the fifth time, and Prof. Boris
Yevdokimovich Vorobyov, for the third?

3) What is the reason for the arrests, and why is arrest
used as the measure of suppression—after all, they will
not run away?

4) Do the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission, the
Gubernia Chekas or any other Chekas issue warrants not for
personal arrests, but for “discretionary” arrests, and if
they do then specify to which personnel (degree of
responsibility, post, political maturity)?

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The document was apparently written in connection with
P. S. Osadchy’s report. On the list of those arrested on the night
of May 27, 1921, in which the names of P. A. Shchurkevich and
B. Y. Vorobyov were underlined, Lenin made a number of
remarks: “Osadchy personally knows both the underlined”; “Same
as I am”; “Perhaps they could be placed only under house arrest?
Couldn’t other measures of suppression be applied? After all,
they are not running away”, etc.

At the same time, Lenin wrote the following note: “1) In the
recent period warrants have been issued for ‘arrest at discretion’.
2) Personal warrants are desirable.”

On June 3, the Chairman of the Petrograd Gubernia Cheka
informed I. S. Unschlicht that all the persons mentioned in
Lenin’s telegram had been released; the arrests in Petrograd were
carried out among former members of the Cadet Party, because
some of them had taken part in a plot uncovered in Petrograd;
persons without compromising material were released. Those
detained were kept under arrest from 12 hours to 36 hours (Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Alsky:

I should like to help Comrade Gastev, Director of the
Institute of Labour.

He needs to make additional purchases worth 500,000 in
gold. That is, of course, something we cannot afford just
now. Could something be bought in Germany with the
Romanov funds?

Think about this, find out more exactly and try to get
him a certain amount. We should, all things considered,
give support to such an institution, even with the situation
as difficult as it
is.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

In a reply letter, A. O. Alsky said that, given Lenin’s consent,            

he could carry through Soviet administrative channels a decision            

to sell £50,000 worth of Chinese loan coupons for the needs of        

the Institute of Labour. On this letter Lenin wrote: “Please direct        

through Soviet administrative channels. 14/VI. Lenin” (Central    

Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the                  

C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On June 8, 1921, the C.L.D. approved the Institute of Labour         

application for 100,000 gold rubles, directing it for realisation    

to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.

Comrade Molotov:

Please have a look at the enclosed letter from  -6 Shklovsky.

I believe there is a C.C. decision—isn’t there? a formal
one in writing (Politbureau)—“to work at the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade in Berlin”.

This decision is being sabotaged by Lutovinov and now
by Stomonyakov as well. Why? I don’t know for sure, but
I can guess: Lutovinov has accused Lenin of extending
“patronage” to Shklovsky (!!). Some people are dissatisfied
with the fact that the Orgbureau decision preventing
Shklovsky from going abroad has been cancelled by the
Politbureau.[1]

An absurd web of intrigue has taken shape. Shklovsky
is absolutely of no use in Russia. His family (many children,
a sick wife) has not adjusted in Russia. Over here it’s
nothing but fret and worry. He is undoubtedly an honest man,
a Bolshevik since the first (1905) revolution; Zinoviev,
all the Bolsheviks and I knew him personally in
Switzerland. Chicherin is satisfied with his work abroad. Krasin
too.

The sabotage by Lutovinov (and now by Stomonyakov)
is a downright scandalous wrecking of the C.C. decision.
When one is dissatisfied, one should lodge a complaint with
the plenary meeting or with the Central Control Commission.
That is one’s sacred right. They have failed to lodge a
complaint, but have engaged in secret sabotage, pushing
Shklovsky close to thoughts of suicide. They refuse to see
that this amounts to mean, dishonest, underhand
harassment of the man.

There are thieves all over the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade; Kopp has clearly been breeding thieves.
It looks as if Kopp has to be removed. That makes it all
the more important to value honest men with a knowledge
of the language and of commerce.

I ask you to seriously bring home to Stomonyakov
(better in writing?) either through the C.C. Secretariat (or—

    

more appropriate perhaps?—by sending to Soils at the
C.C.C.) the following: stop your sabotage or it may come
to your expulsion from the Party. Make him apologise to
Shklovsky, and stop the sabotage.

Drop me a line.

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On February 2, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central    

Committee gave G. L. Shklovsky permission to find work abroad,    

by agreement with L. B. Krasin and G. V. Chicherin, thereby       

countermanding the Orgbureau’s decision of January 21, under      

which Shklovsky was invited to look for work in Moscow or the     

Crimea.

5/VI.   

Comrade Frumkin:

I blame both the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Trade (what a scandal!) and you for this absurd affair with
the fund for the South-Eastern Economic
Council.[1] You
did nothing but whimper, although you should have
brought your precise proposals to the C.L.D. back in April:
1) such-and-such a calendar programme for the shipment
of gold; 2) such-and-such for wool, etc.

What you did, however, was to whimper from April to
June.

We now have to complete what has not been done.

A calendar programme of detailed measures, which is
elaborated with the greatest precision, must be placed
before the C.L.D. by Wednesday (I can appoint the
commission tomorrow, 6/VI—it can be appointed by
agreement between the People’s Commissars).

Make arrangements about this with Khinchuk (he seems
to know something about trade. No one at the People’s
Commissariat for Food does).

Write me at once whether you can pledge now to get
things going and what exactly.

Will you manage to arrange efficient trade with
Constantinople? Or will you run into another
Ancona?[2] into

    

speculators, swindlers (and bankrupts: there are hordes
of them in Constantinople), and merely bring shame upon
yourself and the entire “commodity-exchange operation”
of the South-Eastern Economic Council?

The South-Eastern Economic Council must display more
initiative, but also shoulder more responsibility.

(If you are not going there again, get Beloborodov or
Kaganovich on the direct line and tell them everything I
have written you about; it’s time you got things going and
showed something for your effort.)

Let the South-Eastern Economic Council stop
whimpering and start making timely business proposals to the C.L.D.
and taking care not to be late with supervising their
fulfilment.[3]

Awaiting your letter.

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On March 23, 1921, the C.L.D., in accordance with M. I.
Frumkin’s report “On the Supply of the Northern Caucasus with Raw
Materials and Money”, put the duty on the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the Supreme Economic Council to
submit their opinion on this question to the Narrow C.P.C. On
March 24, the latter made it obligatory upon the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade to place at the disposal of the

   

Commissariat’s agent in the south-east, not later than April 15, 10
million gold rubles worth of currency, valuables and raw materials
for the purchase, on foreign markets in the south, of the goods
required for commodity exchange in the Northern Caucasus. It
turned out at the end of April that the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade had failed to carry out the C.L.D.
assignment.

On June 3, after repeated discussions of the matter in the C.L.D.
and the C.P.C., the C.L.D. authorised a commission, consisting
of L. M. Khinchuk, D. I. Kursky and V. A. Smolyaninov, to
inquire into the failure to fulfil the C.L.D. decision of March 24
and immediately to lake the necessary measures to ensure the
commodity exchange operations in the south-east. Having heard
the commission’s report, the C.L.D. recognised, on June 8, the
need to increase the commodity fund for the south-east, and
instructed the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade to submit
a report on execution of the decision by ail departments.





[2]
A reference to the inquiry into the case of an agreement
concluded with the owners of the cargo on board the Italian ship Ancona.
This agreement was concluded without the sanction of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and M. I. Frumkin, in his
capacity as the Deputy People’s Commissar, was empowered to annul
it, but had failed to do so. As a result, goods of inferior quality
were received, and Frumkin was given a reprimand.





[3]
In a reply letter of June 7, 1921, M. I. Frumkin explained that
the P.C.F.T. had failed to carry out the C.P.C. decision of March 24,
1921, on a commodity-exchange fund for the south-east, because
L. B. Krasin and A. M. Lezhava had been unwilling to give
the South-Eastern Territorial Economic Council the
opportunity of trading independently with foreign markets. Frumkin
said that contrary to Moscow’s instructions, the Economic Council
had concentrated an export fund valued at 2.5 million gold rubles
and had concluded an agreement with the French “Optorg” for
the purchase of goods for the south-east o;i the Constantinople
market (see Note 187). On Frumkin’s letter Lenin wrote: “To
the archives. NB. Important” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

5/VI.

Comrade Lezhava:

Things are thoroughly bad with the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade.

During your illness, Krasin once again tried out his
weak side: excessive self-assurance, sometimes verging on
adventurism.

He seems to say: “I can get away with everything, there
is nothing I can’t do.”

He has that sort of trait.

Yet, despite his “good luck”, and his dexterity and skill,
and art, I would not wager that one fine day this will not
land him in a great scandal with ignominious dismissal.

It’s not right. Krasin was over here; he saw that you
were ill but did nothing.
 

He left one man, Voikov, who was clearly unfit, rather,
unable to cope.

On 3/VI, things at the C.L.D. were close to collapse.
On 25/111, 1921, the C.L.D. decided that the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade had the duty to supply
the South-Eastern Economic Council with 7 million in gold
by 15/IV.

Nothing has been done. Voikov keeps referring, to
statements he had allegedly heard Krasin make that it is
impossible to trade with Constantinople: he says it is full
of swindlers.

If Krasin has said this, it will one day land him in the
dock. It was Krasin’s duty either strictly to implement
the C.L.D. decision of 25/111, or table a proposal at the
C.C. to have the C.L.D. decision rescinded, or satisfy the
South-Eastern Economic Council in some other way, not
through Constantinople (this No. 3 in the hope of his “luck”).

By failing to do either the first, or the second, or the
third, Krasin is committing a breach of the law and is
disrupting all the work. We can’t have that sort of thing.

I ask you to:

1) send a copy of this (or the original) to Krasin, 

2) have a personal talk with Frumkin and Khinchuk, 

3) check up personally on the execution of C.L.D.
decisions, without relying on Voikov, 

4) give serious thought to replacing Voikov by Taratuta
or Paikes, or any other person you may find who is an
efficient and conscientious executive.

Concerning Serebrovsky and Baku, I very much fear now
that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade will
repeat the South-East story.

That is something I will absolutely refuse to tolerate.

I propose that Serebrovsky and Rabinovich should be
sent the following telegram in my name. Please let me know
at once of your objections or amendments.

“Serebrovsky, Baku; Copies to Rabinovich and
Orjonikidze, Baku or Tiflis.

“I am extremely anxious about the agreement concluded
by Serebrovsky with Socifross, and am surprised that this
was reported by Rabinovich, unfortunately, without
comments or practical proposals, while Serebrovsky himself

    

has failed to report
it.[2] This agreement is a strange one.
Where is the guarantee that Socifross will not cheat us?
How can it be allowed to have a monopoly? I do not at all
object to Azvneshtorg and Azneftkom trading directly with
Constantinople, I am prepared to support Baku’s autonomy
within considerable limits, but we must have guarantees.
Please reply at once whether a detailed list of everything
Serebrovsky has bought in Constantinople has been,sent by
reliable courier; when exactly it was sent, and the details
of the agreement and when. I put Serebrovsky under an
obligation to send me a letter with every courier, informing
me by telegram of his name and date of departure. What
exactly has now been ordered from Socifross? All three
addressees must reply to me by
telegram.[3] The secret
sections in
code.[1]


Lenin
 Chairman, C.L.D.”

Any news from Sammer? What is going on there? Is he
sending you his reports? How frequently? Are they detailed
or short? Drop me a line.

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
Lenin underlined the words “The secret sections in code” and
added: “(Code the underlined words).”—Ed.
 



[2]
A reference to the agreement between the Azerbaijan Oil
Committee and the Société Commerciale Industrielle financière pour la
Russie (Socifross), concluded at Constantinople on May 9, 1921.

Upon receiving the documents from A. P. Serebrovsky, Lenin
instructed a special commission to study the agreement and make
the necessary corrections.





[3]
On June 11, 1921, A. P. Serebrovsky sent Lenin by messenger
the documents relating to the purchases and agreements with
the Socifross and a French company for trade with Russia.


On Serebrovsky’s telegram Lenin wrote: “To Smolyaninov.
Confidential. Read. Remember. Get hold of the messenger without
losing an hour. 11/VI. Lenin” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Reply telegrams were also received from G. K. Orjonikidze
and F. Y. Rabinovich, agent of the C.L.D. and the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade in the Transcaucasian republics.

5.VI.1921.

Comrade Radchenko:

Don’t pick on Gidrotorf. This business has been
recognised by law as being of exceptional
importance.[1]

Glavtorf must carry through this law for more than
formal reasons.
 

This is a great invention. We should learn to deal with
the inventors, even when they fret a little.

In this case I see no fretting for the time being.

Kirpichnikov is an inventor. He should be allowed to go
and sent. Objections could arise only from the political
side: If you have any, let me know them in confidence.

If you have none, be sure to send Kirpichnikov.

I am very well aware and highly value your services in
setting up Glavtorf. You have set it up on model lines. I
earnestly request you: do not make a mistake, do not pick
on Gidrotorf.

Regards,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On October 30, 1920, the C.P.C. adopted its decision, “On the
Hydraulic Method of Peat Extraction”, which qualified this
method as of especial urgency and exceptional slate importance,
wherever it was being applied. The S.E.C. Presidium was instructed
to organise under the Central Peat Administration (Glavtorf) an
Administration for Hydraulic Peat Extraction (Gidrotorf), with
R. E. Klasson appointed as head.

5/VI.1921.

Comrade Klasson:

Please inform me (or Smolyaninov when I am not there
or when I am busy) of the exact proposals concerning
assistance to Gidrotorf.

You are also slightly to blame for letting 1921 go by.

See that 1922 does not.

Why did you fail to award prizes of 10,000–50,000 rubles
in gold for the invention of the dehydration method in
Germany? You will recall that we had spoken of this before
your departure!

Is it because you had no money (this should have been
placed before the C.L.D. in advance)? or because that sort
of prize calls for very much? How much? Or is there any
other reason? Is it possible just now to offer such and
similar prizes in Germany, Canada, and America through a
notary public?

Regards,
 Lenin

Urgent!

Comrade Lezhava:

Please add the word unconditionally “(I do not at all
object unconditionally to Azvneshtorg trading directly with
Constantinople”, etc.) and send with this addition.

Awaiting your letter. (P.S. What’s this contract I hear
about involving 35 million francs in Rostov?)

With communist greetings,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with A. M. Lezhava’s letter of June 6,
1921.

Lezhava proposed to Lenin that the following passage should
be deleted from the draft telegram to A. P. Serebrovsky: “I do
not at all object to Azvneshtorg [Azerbaijan People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade] and Azneftkom [Azerbaijan Oil Committee]
trading directly with Constantinople, I am prepared to
support Baku’s autonomy within considerable limits, but we must
have guarantees” (see this volume, Document 198). He argued
that the Azerbaijan Oil Committee did not have a smoothly
running trade apparatus and referred to the prepared agreement on
merging the foreign trade of the three Transcaucasian republics.

Lezhava also mentioned the agreement concluded on April 22,
at Rostov-on-Don, on the basis of the C.L.D. decision of March 24,
between the South-Eastern Territorial Economic Council and the
French “Optorg” on the purchase of 35 million francs worth of
goods at Constantinople through this company. The agreement
was economically unprofitable and was not approved by the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.

(Secret)

Comrade Radchenko, Central Peat Administration

7/VI.

Dear Ivan Ivanych:

I quite understand that it pains you to see how
non-Soviet people—some of them possibly even enemies of the
Soviet power—are making use of their inventions to
profiteer. I quite believe you that Kirpichnikov is that kind
of man. Of course, Klasson is not a supporter of ours either.

But the whole point is that while your feeling of
indignation is quite legitimate, you must not make the mistake
of succumbing to it.

The inventors are not our men, but we must use them.
It is better to let them have more, let them make money,
make a killing—so long as we, too, can advance an
undertaking which is of exceptional importance for the R.S.F.S.R.

Let’s think out our assignments to these men in greater
detail. Perhaps we can adopt this plan:
 

1) Allow Kirpichnikov to go on the trip, provided
precisely specified assignments are carried out; draw up a
list of them.

2) Send along with him, two or three men who are
reliable politically (a worker, one of our engineers, etc.) as
some kind of “commissars”. Give them precise instructions.

Let us approve § 1 and § 2 by agreement with
Krzhizhanovsky.

3) Establish over here in Russia a special centre, order
Gidrotorf’s best machines, set up this special centre with
these special machines, i.e., a special enterprise, and get
it to advance this business in its own way.

Would you find the men to do this?

4) Offer on Glavtorf’s behalf prizes (10,000–30,000
rubles in gold) in Canada and in Germany for the best methods
of dehydrating peat, and for the best models of machines
for Gidrotorf, etc.

Yours,

Lenin

P.S. I wonder why Klasson has failed to award any prizes
in Germany, although he and I had spoken about it.
Could he be dragging things out? Perhaps we should do this
directly through Glavtorf} We should spare no money for
this.

Comrade Stu&cwhattheka (Secret)

7/VI.   

Comrade Stu&cwhattheka:

In fulfilment of your request, I wrote this very day to
Chicherin, asking him to put more pressure on the Latvian
Government, and to send a telegram to Hanecki telling him

    

of my request to exert pressure without fail and rescue
the workers.

Best greetings and congratulations on the successes of
the communist movement in Latvia!

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes

Written in reply to P. I. Stu&chatka’s letter to Lenin of June 6, 1921,
requesting help in exchanging two workers, members of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia, up before a
military tribunal in Riga for persons arrested in the R.S.F.S.R.
for anti-Soviet activity, whom the bourgeois government of
Latvia would like to see released. In the final part of his letter, Stu&cwhattheka
said that the influence of the Communist Party in Latvia was
growing.

Comrade Molotov:

1) About Paikes, please circulate all the members of the
Orgbureau and the Politbureau.

 See Paikes personally for 15 minutes. I think he would
do well for top supply work (not for the University).
If he will not do here, perhaps we could let I. N.
Smirnov in Siberia have him in exchange for someone?

2) I don’t know M. Z. Manuilsky. I abstain. I suggest you
ask the people at Ivanovo-Voznesensk, and inquire from
the People’s Commissars.

3) The question of farming out the port of Petrograd as
a concession has been decided in the C.P.C. (without
me) only in principle and has been referred to a
commission.[1] Both Chicherin and Dzerzhinsky have to fight
it out in the commission.

 Write them (and Zinoviev) about it.

From the commission this will go once again to the C.P.C.,
This means it is early to take it to the Politbureau:
Chicherin and Dzerzhinsky are displaying haste for small reason,
without seriously going into the matter in the usual, Soviet
administrative manner.

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On May 7, 1921, L. B. Krasin sent Lenin a letter soiling out a
British bank’s proposal for a concession agreement to set up a free
port in Petrograd. On Krasin’s letter Lenin wrote: “Put on C.L.D.
agenda for Wednesday, 11/V (appoint commission). 8/V. Lenin”
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee). On May 11, the C.L.D. decided to
set up a commission consisting of representatives from the S.E.C.,
the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and the People’s

   

Commissariat for Railways, to examine the question raised by
Krasin. This question was repeatedly discussed by the Narrow
C.P.C. and the C.L.D., but the proposal for a concession
agreement was not accepted.

Comrade Y. M. Yurovsky

(address: All-Russia Cheka or the People’s Commissariat
for Finance)

Comrade Yurovsky:

Because of a secretarial error, I received your letter of
2/VI only today,
10/VI.[1]

You must act through all the bodies (the C.C.
especially), introducing precise proposals on the best way to run
the business.

You are a participant, and the responsibility is yours.

If things are badly run, set them right by introducing
formal proposals.

That you have already told me is not at all
enough.[2]

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter of June 2, 1921, Y. M. Yurovsky, assigned to work
at the State Depository of Valuables (Gokhran), asked Lenin
whether he should work through the C.P.C., the C.L.D., the
All-Russia C.E.C., and the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. and also through the
press, to secure implementation of his proposals to reorganise
Gokhran, or wait for the results of an inquiry into the theft of
state valuables. See this volume, Documents 173, 180, 216 and
221.

11/VI.

Comrade Molotov:

All the workers of the Party’s centre and I myself knew
Suren Spandaryan in 1908 and 1909. He was a very
valuable and prominent worker. Stasova and possibly the
Caucasians (perhaps Yenukidze as well) should know him.
Suren’s father was receiving our help in Paris in 1910 and
1911 at Suren’s
request.[1]


I propose to the C.C. Secretariat:

1) have the enclosed letter
translated[2];
 

2) make inquiries from Stasova and Yenukidze and others
who had known Suren and his father (if the Secretariat
should recognise the additional inquiry to be necessary);
inquire about dispatch to Tiflis;

3) authorise Bagotsky (Red Cross?) in Switzerland or
Klyshko in London to write to Suren’s father and give him
monetary help by reason of his being the father of a
prominent
revolutionary.[3]

With communist greetings,

 Lenin

from B. Mirimanyan, on which Lenin wrote the document here
published.

Comrade Zinoviev

Urgent

11/VI.   

Comrade Zinoviev:

I have just read Kuusinen’s theses and one-half of the
article (the report),

I have returned them to him with my
remarks.[2]

I do insist that he and he alone ((i.e., not Béla Kun))
should be allowed to give a report at this congress without
fail.

This is necessary.

He knows and thinks (was sehr selten ist unter den
Revolutionären[1]

).

What needs to be done right away is to find one German,
a real one, and give him strict instructions 

to make stylistic corrections at once, 

and dictate the corrected text to a typist.

And at the congress read out for Kuusinen his article–
report (tell Kuusinen to complete the second half within
three days).
 

The German will read it out well. The benefit will be
enormous.[3]

The question will be posed: and this will be very much
more than enough for a start.

Greetings,
 Lenin

P.S. You have not returned to me the copy of my letter to
Levi.[4] Do so without fail. If you don’t, I will not makeup.

Comrade Gorbunov:

This business of a draft C.P.C. decision on collective
supply (of food to enterprises) in connection with the
closure of inessential establishments and concentration of
production at the major enterprises has been pickled.

Larin and Holtzmann (All-Russia Central T.U.C.) tabled
the draft in the Politbureau. On 10/V, the Politbureau
resolved: redraft and introduce in the
C.P.C.[1]

There was also a resolution by the trade union
congress.[2]

Yet, it’s been pickled!

Phone Larin and,the All-Russia Central T.U.C., take
the text of the Politbureau resolution of 10/V, and speed
up the business to the utmost. I fear that it has been hushed
up because of the change of the All-Russia Central T.U.C.

It must be moved forward at a faster rate.

Be sure to phone me the results of your efforts and
reconnoiterings tomorrow, Monday, 13/VI.

Greetings,
 Lenin

16/VI,   

Comrades Koenen

 Thalheimer

 FrÃ¶hlich

Dear Comrades!

I have received a copy of your letter to our Party’s
Central Committee. Thank you very much. I communicated
my answer orally yesterday. I take this opportunity to
emphasise that I do most resolutely withdraw the rude
and impolite expressions I used, and hereby repeat my oral
apology in
writing.[1]

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter to the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee, on June 16, 1921,
Wilhelm Koenen, August Thalheimer and Paul Fröhlich declared
that the German delegation at the Third Congress of the
Comintern, while approving the theses on tactics worked out by the
Russian delegation, demanded that in the event of the congress
adopting a special resolution on the March action, it should include
the following propositions: =

1) the March action was not a putsch,
but a step forward in the development of the German revolution
and the Party, and it is wrong to characterise it as an offensive
without sufficiently extensive preparation; =

2) Paul Levi’s expulsion
from the Party is correct; =

3) all factional activity in the U.C.P.G.
is prohibited, etc.

In saying that he had given a verbal reply to the letter, Lenin
must have meant his speech at the sitting of the German
delegation with the members of the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee on June 15, 1921, in which ho sharply criticised
representatives of the “Left” wing of the U.C.P.G. There is no
record of his speech, but the notes of the speeches by Karl Radek,
Wilhelm Koenen, August Thalheimer, Béla Kun and others, which
Lenin made at the sitting, contained the following remark:
“cursing of the German Leftists of the VKPD (15/VI. 1921)” (Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

For the section of the theses on tactics “Lessons of the March

   

Action” and the resolution “The March Events and the United
Communist Party of Germany”, adopted by the Third Congress
of the Comintern, see Kommunistichesky Internatsional v
dokumentakh. 1919–1932. Moscow, 1933, pp. 194, 225.

Winter has sent me a letter pointing out the need to
take a series of special measures to have the Politbureau
directive concerning the urgent completion of the Kashira
project scrupulously fulfilled. A copy of this letter has

    

been sent to you. I propose that this question should be
urgently examined, the appropriate measures taken and all
the required proposals placed before the C.L.D. right away.
Please let me have a precise statement of what has been
done under each head, through the C.P.C. business manager
Comrade Gorbunov not later than 22.VI.1921.

Send at once by direct line   

Orjonikidze,
 Baku

Serebrovsky should not take offence at the tone of my
telegram: I was worried over the future of Baku. I consider
Serebrovsky a most valuable worker. I demand that you
keep me supplied with exact information about the results
of the work in improving the oil industry in Baku, and
also about the results of foreign trade operations. Let
Serebrovsky see this telegram.

Lenin
 Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on the reverse side of G. K. Orjonikidze’s telegram
to Lenin of June 11, 1921. Orjonikidze informed him that A. P.
Serebrovsky regarded Lenin’s telegram of June 6 (see this volume,
Documents 198 and 201) as an expression of mistrust in him and
was planning to resign, and advised Lenin to send Serebrovsky
a telegram to calm him down.

Molotov

I am entirely in favour. This should be done in formal
terms: the Politbureau decision should be entered in  the
minutes.[1]

18/VI. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter to the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee of June 15, 1921. Referring to the Emmott
commission’s report to Parliament over the state of affairs in Soviet
Russia, Chicherin suggested that a similar “inquiry” should
be made into “Britain’s domestic conditions”. He proposed
that “Comrade Radek should be =

officially =

authorised to start
implementing this plan” (underscored by Lenin).

On June 19, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee resolved: “To adopt the draft and to authorise Comrade
Radek to start implementing the proposed plan, with the right
to enlist other comrades in the work at his discretion” (Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Sklyansky:

Please assign your office worker, Lydia Dmitriyevna
Gribanova, for work in our secretariat. A part of our
secretarial personnel has been sent to the localities.
Experienced and loyal workers should be promoted. I hope that
you will agree to this promotion of Gribanova, who has
worked with us to everyone’s satisfaction.

With communist greetings,

Point-by-point explanation of your letter of 20.VI:

1) Agree to grant concessions for all four enterprises
(Kyshtym, Ekibastuz, Ridder, Tanalyk).
2) We allow
sidings to the concessions; we shall accept some form of
ensuring the concessionaire’s interests on the main line.
3)
Bargain about the term.
4) We shall make available some Soviet
money; bargain.
5) Bargain about the royalties. Never mind
the
oil.[2]
6) Agree to guarantees of immunity.

We shall not grant concessions unless they agree to let
us have 50–100 per cent of the foodstuffs and equipment
they bring in for themselves, with guaranteed payment.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with the talks started in London in
mid-June between People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade L. B.
Krasin and British industrialist and financier Leslie Urquhart, who
before the October Revolution had been Chairman of the
Russo-Asiatic Consolidated Company and the owner of large mining
enterprises in Russia (Kyshtym, Ridder, Tanalyk and Ekibastuz),
on the granting to the latter of concessions for the working and
extraction of minerals. The draft telegram, with some additions,
was approved by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee on July 2, 1921.

From August to September, the talks were carried on in
Moscow. Lenin marked out the principal terms of the concession and
kept a close watch on the course of the negotiations and the
activity of the commission set up to study the enterprises to be leased
(see Lenin Miscellany XX, p. 188; XXIII, pp. 63–69; XXXV,
pp. 219–23; XXXVI, pp. 311–12).

A draft concession agreement was worked out in the course
of the talks. But in October 1921, Urquhart broke off the talks
and joined the anti-Soviet campaign, in the hope of pressuring
and blackmailing the Soviet Government into making serious
concessions.

The talks with Urquhart were resumed in 1922. See this
volume, Documents 750, 754, 768, and also present edition, Vol. 33,
pp. 387–88, 404–05.





[2]
Referring to the 29 per cent royalties on the oil conceptions,
L. B. Krasin believed 25 per cent royalties to be acceptable.

Comrade Alsky:

Have any measures been taken to speed up and intensify
Gokhran’s work?
 

Have any Communists been
mobilised?[1]

Result: within how many months and what exactly will
be done? You will be to blame if the question keeps
“sticking”, because in that case it will be your duty to lodge
a complaint speedily, taking it up to the very top, i.e., the
Politbureau.

But I mean speedily.

The summer must be made use of, and you are letting
it slip by: I warn you that the responsibility will fall
entirely on you. Hurry, and complain to me (about the
C.L.D.) and where I am not competent, to the Politbureau.

Having received this letter, Martens replied to Lenin that he
would immediately start working on the draft C.L.D. decision
concerning the industrial immigration of Russians from America and
would have it ready by six o’clock.

That same day, June 22, 1921, the C.L.D. declared that it was
desirable to “develop separate industrial enterprises or groups of
enterprises by leasing them to groups of American workers, and
industrially developed peasants, on contractual terms assuring
them of a measure of economic autonomy” (Lenin Miscellany
XX, p. 202) The C.L.D. also recognised the need to regulate the
industrial immigration of workers from other countries, and
instructed the S.E.C. to work out the terms for leasing enterprises
to these workers.

21/VI.

Comrade Teodorovich:

The meat tax has now been carried
through.[1]
Would you consider it timely just now to do everything
possible to develop beef cattle husbandry on the suburban
state farms, the industrial state farms (i.e., those attached
to industrial workers), in the army, etc., etc.

You once said that the specialists believe it possible
to develop rabbit-breeding and pig-breeding (without the
use of cereals). Why not have some measures legalised in
this sense right away.

Drop me a line.

Yours,
 Lenin

22.VI.1921

Comrade Martens:

I must reproach you for having misdirected the papers
on the American colonies in
Russia.[1]

I read them only on 20/VI. You should not have sent
them through Bukharin, but should have formulated some
20 lines of practical proposals in Russian, and sent them
up to the C.L.D., and a copy for me personally and a short
letter.

The delay was due to the misdirection of the file.

In substance: I am in favour, provided the American
workers and settlers in general will bring along with them:

1) foodstuffs for two years (you say that this has been
done before, which means that it is possible);

2) clothes, for a similar period;

3) implements of labour.

No. 1 (and No. 2) are the most important. The $200 is less
important. If we have No. 1, I agree to give every support.

To speed things, draw up a draft C.L.D. decision right
away and table it today (if you can, before 3.00 p.m.),
this very day in the C.L.D., and we shall decide at 6.00;
even if you are late, table it in the C.L.D. at 6.00, we shall
set up a commission and decide it on Friday, 24/VI.

Draft decision:
1) terms—the three afore-mentioned,

2) management (you+1 American worker+1 from the
People’s Commissariat for Labour?),
3) we help (give land,
timber, pits, etc.),
4) financial relations such-and-such.

Please reply by bearer.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.

P.S. After writing this letter, I saw that the question
is on today’s C.L.D. agenda. Please elaborate the points
I have
indicated.[2]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On June 10, 1921, L. K. Martens, a member of the S.E.C.
Presidium, submitted to Lenin a copy of his report to the S.E.C.
Presidium, which urged the need to enlist for work in Soviet industry
foreign workers, chiefly Russian émigrés in America, many of
whom were eager to go to Soviet Russia in view of the industrial
crisis in America at the end of 1920 and early 1921. His report
also contained a number of practical proposals on organising the
immigration of foreign workers.

On page 1 of the report, Lenin wrote: “NB: p. 9, bring along
food”, and on page 9, he underlined Martens’s words: “They have
brought with them food for six months”, and wrote in the margin:
“NB” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

The report was appended to Minutes No. 224 of the C.L.D.
sitting on June 22, 1921. A detailed article about this appeared
in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn No. 157 of July 20, 1921, and was then
reprinted in the monthly information journal Soviet Russia (Vol.
V, No. 4, 1921, pp. 156–58).





[2]
Having received this letter, Martens replied to Lenin that he
would immediately start working on the draft C.L.D. decision
concerning the industrial immigration of Russians from America and
would have it ready by six o’clock.

That same day, June 22, 1921, the C.L.D. declared that it was
desirable to “develop separate industrial enterprises or groups of

Comrade Rykunov:

I have read your letter and agree absolutely on almost
every
point.[1]

You are so right about recruiting the merchants.

I am sending this on to the C.C. members.

Keep up the pressure.

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter of June 21, 1921, M. V. Rykunov, a member of the
Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade,
proposed that more Communists should be enlisted for improving
the work of the People’s Commissariat, with two or three
practitioners added to the Collegium, that former private exporters
should help to organise the marketing of goods abroad, that
permission should be given to pay commission fees to workers in
trade, etc.

On the letter are Lenin’s underscorings, the word “correct!”
under some of Rykunov’s proposals and the note: “From
Rykunov. 22/VI. To Comrade Molotov” (Central Party Archives). The
letter was retyped and sent to all members of the Orgbureau and
the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee. At the same
time, Rykunov submitted a memo on the formation of an export
fund For Lenin’s remarks and underlinings see Lenin Miscellany
XX, pp. 249–50.

I request an urgent examination. We must help them and
be sure to give the money.

There is an imperative Politbureau directive to have
Kashira completed in 1921. The execution needs checking.

22/VI. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is written on a telephone message from G. D. Tsyurupa,
chief engineer of the Kashira Power Station construction site,
sent to Lenin on June 22, 1921. He reported that the project
had no money, which is why there were delays in the supply of
building and other materials, and of wages to workers.

On June 23, 1921, the Narrow C.P.C. examined Lenin’s
proposal and authorised the People’s Commissariat for Finance to
order the finance department of the Moscow Soviet to provide the
Kashira site with the necessary amount of money, as a matter of
top priority.

This business must be finished at all costs, and not later
than this summer. Yesterday, Basha tabled some of your
wishes in the C.P.C., and after being co-ordinated, they
will be
adopted.[2]
 

Draw up as precise a calendar programme of the

In his report on June 23, 1921, G. I. Bokii informed Lenin of
the measures taken by him to prevent stealing at the State
Depository of Valuables (Gokhran). At the same time, Bokii sent Lenin
a copy of the preliminary report, submitted by a commission
which had made an inquiry into its work, and containing the
proposals for improving it. On July 8, Lenin was sent a calendar plan
for work to reorganise Gokhran.

25/VI

Comrade Frumkin:

I have read your proposals. I agree. We shall table them
in the Politbureau
today.[1] I have one other request.
Elaborate the addendum: “authorise a small commission,
Lezhava, Khinchuk, Frumkin+??, immediately to work out
a plan to cover this amount (100) with a special export
fund, raw materials, timber, etc., and to do this covering
most rigorously, with weekly reports. Designation: special
cover of urgent expenditure.”

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to a draft decision of the commission, consisting of
A. M. Lezhava, L. M. Khinchuk, P. L. Voikov and M. I.
Frumkin, which it took on June 24, 1921, on the need to buy grain in
foreign markets and to make available a 100-million ruble credit
for this purpose.

On this draft Lenin made the following remarks: “secret”, “to
the archives”, and added in the margin: “Two additions: =

1)
Weekly reports on the execution and course of this operation from
Lezhava + Frumkin + Khinchuk. =

2) Sent to Frumkin” (Central

   

Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

The Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee took
account of these additions in its decision. “On Grain Purchases”,
adopted on June 25. In a telegram to Krasin in London, Lezhava
stressed that Lenin “specially requests more speed with the
purchase and delivery of the big consignment of grain” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

1) Commission Chairman Kaisarov
 2) Ionov
Petrograd

25/VI.1921

Concerning the School Atlas

I have received the material on the atlas. I scanned it
and made some additions (red ink in the text).
 

Please send me:

1) A calendar programme of the work (not under the
best conditions—“if” we are supplied this and that—but
under the present); in particular: when the work will be
finished.

2) Allocation of the work between the members of the
commission.

3) Text and maps, when ready, before they are sent to
the printers.

4) Conclusion on the question whether it is desirable
and possible to enlist Anuchin and Borzov for this work
(for what reasons—in the event of a positive and a negative
answer to the questions).

5) Conclusion on whether the members of the commission
or its chairman will undertake the additional work
described in the attached copy of my letter to Pavlovich.
Pavlovich has refused. I have asked a comrade in Germany
to do this, but have not yet had his
reply.[1]

It would be   fine if the commission did
this.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

 Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 

[1]
See present edition, Vol. 35, Document 283.—Ed.
 



[2]
In a reply letter on July 5, 1921, V. D. Kaisarov said that a
special scientific commission for compiling a geographical atlas
undertook to elaborate the questions outlined in Lenin’s letter to
M. P. Pavlovich (see present edition, Vol. 35, Document 283), and
asked that two of its members should be sent to Berlin to acquire
new material on the West European economy, noting that it was
desirable to enlist Moscow specialists in compiling the atlas. The
letter said that the commission’s programme and calendar plan
of work would be sent to Lenin shortly.

On this letter Lenin made his remarks and underlinings and
wrote a number of instructions to Lydia Fotieva (see this
volume, Document 140, and Lenin Miscellany XX, pp. 321–22).

G. M.:

A reminder:

Concerning the electric-power station. Together with the
Moscow Committee or its commission + the Moscow Cheka
you should draw up a calendar programme for purging it
of all Mensheviks by 1.XII.1921, or some other such date.

For the Gosplan—a practical programme of work:

α) practical verification of current plans (the items and
methods);
 

β) reduction in the number of institutions (also the
period of work);

γ) ditto—the number of staff, etc.

A precise and practical programme.

Regards,
 Lenin

This matter should be promoted more intensively
through Martens, a member of the Supreme Economic Council
Presidium.

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written in connection with a resolution sent to Lenin by
a general meeting of workers of the Moscow Garment Factory No.
36 named after the Third International (émigrés from America).

They wrote that for a month they had been unable to start their
factory equipped with the latest machines and devices which they
had brought along from America, and asked Lenin to help them to
obtain the materials necessary to complete the equipment of the
factory and the repair of the premises, and also to obtain housing.

On June 27, 1921, Lenin signed letters to L. K. Martens and
V. T. Likhachov, Chairman of the Moscow Gubernia Economic
Council, ordering them to remove all red tape in this matter and
to help the émigré workers to start the factory as soon as
possible (see Lenin Miscellany XX, p. 201).

Shafransky, Gubernia Party Committee,

 Samarkand

I thank the group of friends for their greetings. The
main thing just now is an immediate improvement in the
conditions of the workers and peasants. On the vigour and
skill of the workers in the localities now depends
everything: the tax in kind, the development of turnover
between agriculture and industry, and the development of
small-scale industry. We have no fear of capitalism, because
the proletariat has the power, transport and large-scale
industry firmly in its hands and will succeed, through its

    

control, in channeling it into state capitalism. Under these
conditions, capitalism will help to combat red tape and
the scattering of the petty producers. We shall win out
because we know what we want.

Lenin
 Chairman, C.L.D.

Written in reply to a letter from a group of Communists of the
Samarkand organisation on June 15, 1921, “To the First Soldier of
the World Communist, Revolutionary Army”, in which they sent
their whole-hearted greetings to Lenin and expressed their
approval of the New Economic Policy. On the envelope Lenin wrote
this assignment to his secretary dated June 27, 1921: “Urgent.
Send them a telegram, of thanks and approval. Give me the draft”
(Lenin Miscellany XX, p. 117). The draft of the reply telegram
was written by the C.P.C. Secretariat on the basis of Lenin’s
instructions.

Having just returned from a trip to your parts,
Comrade Badayev told me something of the good reception
given to him by the local comrades and their whole-hearted
sympathy for the cause of the Moscow and Petrograd
workers.

Will you kindly convey to all your local comrades my
deep gratitude and request to continue giving the most
vigorous and every possible assistance in food supplies to
the workers of the two leading cities.

The situation is difficult. The utmost assistance is
required. I am sure that you will do everything you can.

I send you communist greetings.

Comrade Martens:

I ask you to give full and resolute assistance in the
organisation of garment factory No. 36 by American workers.

Eliminate all delays in obtaining the necessary

    

materials, especially pipes and fittings for them (T-joints,
couplings, etc.), and electric wiring.

Help the collective of workers to obtain housing, a
matter that must be settled without any delays on the part
of the housing department.

The completion and the earliest starting of the factory
must be achieved in the shortest possible period.
Inadmissible negligence and red tape have been displayed in this
whole business.

Chairman, Council of Labour and Defence
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the spring of 1921, a group of American garment workers
collected money, bought industrial equipment and left for the

   

Soviet Republic. They were given the opportunity to organise
their garment factory No. 36 in Moscow, which was housed in a
four-storeyed building, made available on Lenin’s personal
instructions.

On June 16, 1921, the American workers wrote Lenin a
collective letter asking him to help them to complete the building of
the factory. Lenin took the most, active part in preparations to
start the factory (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition,
Vol. 53, Supplement, Documents 2 and 3).

2/VII.   

G. M.:

It hasn’t come out.

Here is the general impression of the “first reading”:

Page 1:

“many” see an “obvious” deviation...


(why admit that the rebuke comes from “many”?
This sets the wrong tone and is a “move” ... in
favour of the enemies).

Page 2:

“the overall reorganisation of the People’s
Commissariats, which is inevitably connected”...

 (“inevitably”? There is nothing inevitable because
there is NO overall reorganisation taking place at
all. It turns out that the author refers the reader
to the “overall” which does not exist),

Page 3:

emphasis on the principal element, concentration
on the large enterprises, etc...

“But a little thought will show that it is
impossible to do this piecemeal” ... “piecemeal-ism”.

    


(Untenable. Piece-by-piece is the only possible way.
The start should be modest, with one case.)

Page 4: ...

Extremes are intolerable

(indisputable, but academic)

Osadchy at the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Trade (already named twice)

“Gosplan members (Osadchy alone?) find
themselves doing the spade-work continuously”...

 35 –1==34

Page 5: ...

Fuel ... Larin (why quote him without giving a
single figure? Encouraging the enemy! One should
either say nothing about him, discussing one’s own
work in words other than Larin’s, with one’s own
facts, or attack him. Any other tactic==sure defeat).

Page 6:

“a group of workers to combat the famine has
been hastily set up”

(? that is not the business of Gosplan at all!)

Page 7: !

Page 8:

instructions of C.L.D. Chairman

 (? Which? the reader does not know)

 Supreme Council for Transportation +
Special Transport Commission

 People’s Commissariat for Railways ... “will
perhaps not fail to make itself felt” (the
italicised words are also in favour of the enemies).
Neopikhanov...

 (what has he done anyway? Not a single clear
word.

 There is not a single example. How did he
help?

 Economised? Discovered an error? Helped to
avoid it? how precisely?)

8--9: ... “Assignments”...

 Everyone is so fed up with assignments that
the less said of them the better. Everyone has
a host of assignments.
 General, universal, all-encompassing assignments
which are clearly not going to be fulfilled.
 

This has been a partial or even a total failure. It is better
to say nothing in the press for the time being. But for a
report in the C.L.D.

(α) bring out clearly something that has been actually
achieved, even if it is only three or four small but
precise and factual examples, a thing that has been
achieved instead of assignments, something that has been
concretely implemented instead of the general and the
projected.

 What has Ramzin done in Petrograd?

 “ “ Neopikhanov in Moscow?

   Strumilin

   Popov

   and others.

(β) Has the work been allocated to the individual members?

When?

To how many of the 35?

(γ) Of the ten commissions of the People’s Commissariats,
relations are correct with one (? fuel).

 How is this expressed?

 What are the real achievements in the plan for the
second half of 1921?

 Fuel economies?

   Conclusion: carry forward the merger with the 10,
overcome the inertness of the 9 which are doing nothing?

(δ) Prepare plan for the second half of 1921?

 People’s Commissariat for Agriculture (crop?) Central
Statistical Board?

 Current section

 Supreme Economic Council

That is how, I think, the material should be roughly
arranged for a report in the C.L.D.

The general arid consolidated plan will apparently be
ready not earlier than the autumn of 1921, and it cannot
be given until the crop is estimated.

Let that be so. (But the crop is one thing, and the
quantity of tax collected and grain obtained is another. You
will know this quantity in 1922, post factum.)
 

This means that we shall still have to proceed from
the estimated minimum figures.

The partial plans have been drawn up (fuel?); half
completed (People’s Commissariat for Railways?). I suppose here
we can give something factual.

A quarter completed? The number of mouths? (this is
the business of the Central Statistical Board and not of
Gosplan, Everyone will he heaping their own work on
Gosplan. It must not let them do it).

But the main thing still is: immediately, right away,
“piece by piece” eliminate all the obviously irrational, all
that clearly contradicts the slate economic plan.
(close down such-and-such establishments in such a
branch...

 close down or half-close down such-and-such railways ...
build such-and-such fuel lines...

 designate the tract of forest which, according to Ramzin,
will yield more than any Algemba, and give a plan: how
it should be felled, cut and transported....

Of 1,000 good factories start 10 by a given date, 50,
by another, etc., going all the way up to 100 or even 200).

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the first part of the letter Lenin made remarks on the first
variant of G. M. Krzhizhanovsky’s article “To Our Critics”,
written in reply to Y. Larin’s article in Pravda on June 9, 1921,
which was entitled “The Mysteries of Soviet Industry”, and which
criticised the work of the State Planning Commission (Gosplan).
Krzhizhanovsky wrote to Lenin: “On the spur of the, moment, I
sketched out an article ‘To Our Critics’, but then found it too
flippant and decided to shelve it. If you have a moment to spare
for light reading, run your eye over it...” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee). Krzhizhanovsky subsequently rewrote his
article (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 53,
Document 298).

The second part of the letter (from the words: “But for a
report in the C.L.D.”) contains Lenin’s proposals for
Krzhizhanovsky’s report at the C.L.D. on Gosplan’s work. The report was
heard on July 8, 1921.

Comrade Unschlicht:

There, is bad news about Petrograd. it is said that the
S.R.s are making redoubled efforts, and that the
Petrograd Cheka knows nothing about the S.R.s! They are said
to be a new lot, with an excellent secret organisation and
their own agents.

We must look sharp, so as not to miss another
Kronstadt.

Please devote more of your attention, and write me
this very day.
 

Perhaps we should send some experienced Cheka men
from here to Petrograd?

S.R. peasants are said to be sent by the S.R.s to
Petrograd. Is that so?

What is your information, what are your
plans?[2]

With communist greetings,

 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin must have written this letter in connection with L. B.
Krasin’s telegram of July 4, 1921, in which Krasin reported on
the congress of Russian counter-revolutionaries (monarchists,
Cadets and Right-wing Socialist-Revolutionaries), which was held
in Paris at the end of June 1921. It adopted a decision to organise
revolts at Kronstadt and in Petrograd at the end of July or in
early August to overthrow the Soviet power.





[2]
On July 7, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee instructed the All-Russia Cheka to take the necessary
precautionary measures and also decided to send “to Petrograd
within the next few weeks a number of Communist metalworkers
from among veteran Party members” (Central Party Archives of
the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

I propose that this be approved by telephone with this
addition: an assignment to buy the greatest possible

Written on a memo to the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee from
Deputy People’s Commissar for Food N. P. Bryukhanov and

   

Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade A. M. Lezhava,
reporting the possibility of purchasing 5 million poods of wheat in
North-Eastern Persia, and requesting the allocation of 4 million
silver rubles for that purpose. On July 6, 1921, this was approved
by the Politbureau.

On July 18, the Narrow C.P.C. appropriated 4 million rubles

7.VII.1921

Comrade Molotov:

Following my talk with Unschlicht I propose that the
C.C. should resolve:

order Comrade Menzhinsky to go on holiday and take
a rest at once, until the doctors give him a health
certificate in writing. Meanwhile, he should be in attendance
for two or three hours, not more than two or three times
a week.

Rykov and Molotov

I have a mortal fear of shuttling. Mekhonoshin is not
fit at all for work in the centre.

I feel that Babkin and Avanesov are overdoing it with
the “inquiries”. I think that your commission should take
no more than three hours to complete the case:

   Bryukhanov

   and Potyaev
 should both be (politely) told off;
another quarrel between
you two and we shall dismiss and jail
both.[1]

That’s all.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the conflict between the Central Administration
of the Fishing Industry (Glavryba) (Chairman A. I. Potyaev) and
the People’s Commissariat for Food, in which the former
insisted on its inclusion in the system of S.E.C. administrations,
while the latter wanted to retain its own control over it.

On July 7, 1921, a commission of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee, set up to settle the conflict, decided that the
Administration was to be left under the People’s Commissariat for Food,
and ordered the heads of the two establishments to work in close
contact and maintain normal relations.

Lenin wanted the conflict settled as soon as possible, because
friction at the centre had a negative effect on work all down the
line. See this volume, Documents 272, 273, 274, 275, 276 and 290;
and Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 53,
Documents 50 and 119.

To Comrade Zinoviev, with a request to communicate
the following to the members of yesterday’s Commission:

Dear Comrades:

I have been informed that what I said in the
Commission yesterday against—rather, against some—Hungarian
Communists has aroused
dissatisfaction.[1] I hasten
therefore to intern you in writing: when I was an émigré myself
(for more than 15 years), I took “too Leftist” a stand
several times (as I now realise). In August 1917, I was also
an émigré and moved in our Party Central Committee a
much too “Leftist” proposal which, happily, was
flatly
rejected.[2] It is quite natural for émigrés frequently to
adopt attitudes which are “too Leftist”. It has never

    

entered my mind, now or in the past, to impute this to such
fine, loyal, dedicated and worthy revolutionaries as the
Hungarian émigrés, who are so much respected by all of
us, and by the whole Communist International.

With communist greetings,

 Lenin

7/VII.1921.

Comrade Molotov:

I request the Orgbureau or the C.C. Secretariat (with
subsequent approval by the Politbureau over the
telephone) to allow me a month’s holiday, in accordance with
Dr. Getier’s orders, with attendance of Politbureau, C.P.C.

three times a week. I shall inform Comrade Molotov

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Lenin’s amendments to the draft theses of the S.E.C.
on implementing the principles of the New Economic Policy; the
draft was adopted by the S.E.C. Presidium on July 6, 1921 (see
Lenin Miscellany XX, pp. 102–06). The text of the draft with
Lenin’s amendments was sent to G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, I. T.
Smilga, N. P. Bryukhanov, A. M. Lezhava, V. A. Avanesov and
V. V. Schmidt. On July 11, the S.E.C. Presidium again examined
the draft theses, approved them and passed them on for
discussion by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee.

   

On July 12, 1921, the S.E.C. theses were examined by the C.P.C.,
and on July 16, by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. The
latter adopted the theses as a basis and appointed a commission
to edit them. The commission produced a new variant, to which
Lenin also made his amendments (see Collected Works, Fifth
(Russian) Edition, Vol. 44, p. 73). This draft was discussed on
July 23 at a meeting of the communist group of the Central
Committees of the trade unions, the Presidium of the Moscow Gubernia
T.U.C., and representatives of Petrograd trade unions. The
meeting adopted the theses as a basis and appointed a commission
which, together with the Party C.C. commission, worked out a
final text. On August 9, this was adopted by a plenum of the
Party Central Committee, and on the same day given legislative form
through the C.P.C. as “C.P.C. Instructions on Implementing the
Principles of the New Economic Policy” (see Direktivy KPSS i
Sovetskogo pravitelstva po khozyaistvennym voprosam [Directives
of the C.P.S.U. and the Soviet Government on Economic Questions],
Vol. 1, Moscow, 1957, pp. 254–59).

Comrade Smilga:

I have read the draft. I enclose my
amendments.[1]


My insistent advice is 

1) not to make the move in your name (why tease the
geese? Why make the possible unanimity of one and all
more difficult?).

2) Make the move only on behalf of the S.E.C. Presidium.


S.E.C. Chairman Bogdanov will introduce it in the C.C.

3) Another piece of advice: agree with Krzhizhanovsky
the wording of the point on Gosplan (your wording is wrong;
I shall not accept it).

The basic point can be easily agreed, and then the thing
should be moved on behalf of the two presidiums: the
S.E.C. Presidium + Gosplan Presidium.

Please reply on 11/VII.

With communist greetings,

 Lenin

P.S. Perhaps it should also be shown to the People’s

    

Commissariat for Food and the Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection and the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.

Think this over and reply on 11/VII.

(Secret
 10/V1I.

G. M.:

Please read this as soon as you can. Compare this draft
with my amendments (in pencil).

Tell me what you think,

I have crossed out the §§ about Gosplan. Perhaps you
will replace them by one paragraph: say, there is need to
accelerate, increase and intensify in the precisely specified
direction.

The theses could then perhaps go over the signature of
the S.E.C. Presidium + Gosplan Presidium?

Return and reply as soon as you can.

With communist greetings,

 Lenin

I am in favour of both proposals.

1) Start supply of coal and foodstuffs to Petrograd right
away; sign right away.

2) Accept Nansen’s terms: he will send one man.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a letter from V. M. Molotov, Secretary of the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C., who put to the vote of the Politbureau members
two proposals: =

1) to authorise a commission of P. A. Bogdanov and
G. V. Tsyperovich to draft an agreement with the German
consortium on its participation in rehabilitating the metal industry
of Petrograd; and =

2) Fridtjof Nansen’s proposal to send food to
the population of Petrograd. Both were adopted by the
Politbureau on July 11, 1921.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

I very much fear that Lezhava’s optimism is groundless.
Ask for the facts and check them. Do the checking
personally and twice. Then have a direct-line talk with
Chutskayev and Ivan Nikitich Smirnov. Otherwise I will not
believe that the matter has been secured.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

This is a matter of exceptional importance and urgency.
You are responsible for its execution. Press on with it in
every possible way. Krasin will be here on 13/VII. Place

Notes
 
 



[1]
The notes to V. A. Smolyaninov were written in connection with
the fitting out of the Kara expedition to deliver goods to the
mouth of the Ob and the Yenisei in Siberia for commodity exchange
with a Swedish company. S. Y. Chutskayev, Deputy
Chairman of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee, in a telegram to
Lenin on July 8, 1921, expressed doubt concerning the
successful outcome of the Kara expedition, in view of L. B. Krasin’s
cancellation of the agreement with the Swedes and the purchases
of goods from the British.

On July 14, 1921, on Lenin’s assignment, V. A. Smolyaninov,
together with L. B. Krasin, wrote a reply to Chutskayev
informing him of the measures taken to ensure the expedition,

Semashko, my pretty one!

Don’t fret, sweetheart! We shall leave the Quakers to
you, to you alone. You mustn’t be jealous of Kuskova.

Today’s directive to the Politbureau: Kuskova must be
strictly rendered harmless. You are in the “communist
cell” and will have to be on your toes, keeping a strict
watch over this.
 

We shall get Kuskova to give us her name, her signature
and a couple of carloads from those who sympathise with
her (and others of her stripe).
Not a thing more.

It is really not very hard to do this.

[1]
Written at a sitting of the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on     

July 12, 1921, in connection with the discussion of the question      

of an All-Russia Famine Relief Committee. N. A. Semashko              

objected to the establishment of the committee, saying that the       

Mensheviks and the S.R.s could use it for hostile activity against    

the Soviet power. To prevent this, the Politbureau approved a         

plan to set up a communist group in the Committee and decided         

to bring into its Presidium only a limited number of bourgeois        

“public figures”.

Comrade Korostelev,

Member of the Collegium,

Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection

13/VII.

Comrade Korostelev:

Why have you not yet done anything about the matter
on which we had
agreed?[1] L. B. Kamenev says: You have
put off your report to the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet
of Deputies.

Where’s the hitch?

Are there any special reasons? Or is it that you have
changed your mind? Perhaps you have failed to reach
agreement with someone?

Please let me have an answer to these questions as soon
as possible, and also telephone me, in case of need. This
is an extremely important and urgent matter.

With communist greetings,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a talk with A. A. Korostelev, member of the Collegium of
the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection,
in early July 1921, Lenin proposed that a Commission for
Assisting the Economic Bodies should be set up under this People’s
Commissariat. Korostelev was to report on the matter to the
Presidium of the Moscow Soviet. However, the report was not heard
at the scheduled time because of the simultaneous opening of the
Third Gubernia Congress of Soviets, and was given to the new
executive committee of the Moscow Soviet on July 15, 1921.

Attaching great importance to the work of the Commission,
Lenin insisted on having regular progress reports (see present
edition, Vol. 35, Document 291; Collected Works, Fifth (Russian)
Edition, Vol. 53, Document 133).

Comrade Fotieva:

1) Urgently find the author, have a talk with him,
reassure him and toll him that I am ill but will see to it that
the matter is dealt with.
 

2) Please have his letter typed in several copies:

1 for Molotov

1 for Solts, Central Control Commission.

3) When sending the letter to Molotov add on my
behalf: I propose that a Control Commission should be sent
to the Don consisting of a member of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee + 10 (or 20) of Sverdlov men (taking
the author along with them), and that everyone found
guilty of plundering should be shot on the spot.

Written in connection with a letter from I. A. Semyannikov,
a Communist Red Armyman, who informed Lenin about cases of
mismanagement, stealing and abuse of power by food supply
workers and responsible Communists in the Don region. He requested
immediate measures to stop these scandalous practices which were
arousing indignation among the workers and peasants.

Dear Comrade:

Could you get me some material relating to the
American third party of the workers’ and peasants’, or the
workers’ and farmers’, union, or the non-partisan party, and
its activity in the State of North Dakota, which is in this
party’s
bands.[1] I should like to have a few but the most
important documents on this party and its activity in
North Dakota and, what would be even better, a short
note from you on this question, in addition to these
documents. If it is not too much trouble, write me soon, whether
you are able to do this and when.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
For Lenin’s assessment of the American third party—the
workers’ and peasants’ or workers’ and farmers’ union see present
edition, Vol. 33, pp. 146–47.

In a reply letter of July 14, 1921, M. M. Borodin wrote that
he would prepare a report within Eve days on the strength of the
available material. On Borodin’s letter Lenin wrote this
assignment, to his secretary: “Please give me a reminder within a week.
14.VII. Lenin”, which he later crossed out and wrote: “To the
archives.”

Upon receipt of Borodin’s report. Lenin wrote a reply (see
this volume, Document 284).

Comrade Shklovsky:

I have spoken both to Stomonyakov and Krasin. I
enclose a note from Krasin. He promised to see you.
Lutovinov gave me his “word of honour” that he would treat
you “impartially”. I have done everything I could. I
reaffirm what I have told you personally: you should “make
a fresh start” in Berlin and gain a position for yourself
by your work. This happened to some old Party members
after 1917. Best wishes to you and your whole family!

Comrade Korostelev:

Of course, the whole point is to help the enterprises.
You are right. We shall start switching individual
enterprises to collective supply immediately. Both L. B. Kamenev
and myself are in favour of this. We shall get through the
C.L.D. the list which you will hand in, by agreement with
the Moscow presidium (or against the Moscow workers, if
they prove to be obstinate). Please reply by messenger.

collective supply for workers has not yet been introduced at

17/VII.

Dear Comrades:

I thank you very much for the book you have sent
me[1]
and for your friendly letter. I have read the book with
interest. It will undoubtedly be important for the history
of how the Soviet power was organised.

I am sending you a copy of the just published law on
the district economic councils and the “Mandate”. I hope
that you will get a statistician in advance, give him the
material, verify his work, add to it yourself (together with
essays by some other local Rogozhsko-Simonovsky
comrades, if any are willing to write them) and publish next
autumn a report on the content and the results of local
economic work by your district Soviet of Deputies. I hope
that you will display initiative in this and that your
district will be among the first in developing local economic
construction.

I thank you once again, and send you communist
greetings.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Twelfth Simbirsk Uyezd Congress of Soviets

Simbirsk

This is to inform you that the Soviet Government is
taking the most urgent and resolute measures to render

    

assistance to those who have suffered from the crop failure.
Collections have been started everywhere. On 12/VII the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee appealed to the
whole population of Russia to do everything to help the
starving. A special famine relief committee has been set
up under the All-Russia C.E.C. A similar committee has
been set up to obtain assistance in the form of grain from
abroad. Authorised representatives of the All-Russia C.E.C.
are leaving for your parts within a few days. We are doing
everything we can.

Lenin
Chairman, C.L.D.

Kalinin has told me of the idea to make a special
collection of one pound per pood of collected grain in aid of
the starving in the Volga area, Let me know whether this
matter has been pushed through and when you intend
to have it passed by the Presidium of the All-Russia
C.E.C.[1] I think we should: 1) have this passed at once;

2) demand, as a matter of the greatest urgency, that each
uyezd should send a few carloads of grain to the Volga
area, and that every consignment of grain must be
accompanied by two or three local peasants who will see for
themselves the scale of the disaster and tell their fellow peasants
about it;
3) we should consider the institution of some kind
of order or honorary cross for intensified assistance to the
starving in the Volga area.

Notes
 
 



[1]
On August 1, 1921, the Central Famine Relief Commission under
the All-Russia C.E.C. issued an appeal to the peasants and all
toiling citizens of the R.S.F.S.R., urging a contribution for the
famine-stricken areas of one pound per pood of threshed grain.
On August 4, the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C. adopted a
decision on deducting, for the benefit of the starving, one per
cent per pood of foodstuffs procured through commodity
exchange (published in Izvestia VTslK No, 172 on August 6,
1921).

Orders for the Kashira electric-power station are of
especial importance. There is a C.C. decision on the
unconditional need to accelerate this matter, so as to have the
station started with 12,000 kw not later than December
of this year. Find out about these orders everything you
can before you leave, and upon your arrival in Berlin take
all steps to speed and check up on accurate execution.
I regard this as your personal responsibility. Please
telegraph me from Berlin about the measures you take, when
exactly the orders will be ready, and when exactly they
will be delivered in Moscow.

Glavugol, S.E.C.

Please let me know without delay how far the things
have gone with the purchase abroad of coal-cutting
machines for the Donets Basin.

Comrade Smolyaninov has informed me that he has
established from his telephone conversations with Comrade
Grigoryev that there are some doubts at Glavugol about
the proven advisability of making extensive use of
coal-cutting machines in the extraction of coal, or at any rate,
that the production effect expected by Comrade Pyatakov
from the use of coal-cutting machines is exaggerated.

Please let me have absolutely precise and definite
information about Glavugol’s opinion on the advisability of
coal-cutting machines in the extraction of coal in the
Donets Basin, and on the effect their use in production can
have on boosting output.

Also let me know where, and where best, coal-cutting
machines can be bought—in Germany or in Britain, and
how soon this can be done.

20/VII.

I have read your letter on 20/VII.

I agree with you that co-operatives cannot be allowed
to increase the prices of agricultural produce. But there
you must make fully practicable and concrete proposals.

    

The same thing applies 1o the meat agreement. Keep an
eye on the results of the co-operative work and bring in
concrete proposals.

20/VII.1921.

Comrades Richard MÃ¼ller
    and Heinrich Malzahn

Dear Comrades:

I was able to read your letter of 18/VII only
today.[1]
I have spoken with Comrade Heckert on the question you
raised only ones and quite briefly. When he asked what
I thought about it, I told him that I was too inadequately
informed to judge, that those expelled should of course be
organised in some way, and that in this sense Heckert’s
proposal seems to be correct.

That is all.

I know nothing about “unions”, or the tactless actions
of individual Communists (which made expulsion easier
for the social-traitors).

The resolution adopted by the congress (which you have
sent me) tells me that the unions are not approved
(“insignificant”, “diffuse”, “sow confusion”). The practical
slogan is: “Do not pull out more workers’ groups from the
centralised free unions.”

What is there to be said against it?

Moreover, you yourselves hope to secure control of the
unions.

I shall send your letter to Comrades Lozovsky and
Zinoviev, to obtain fuller information.

With communist greetings,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A letter sent to Lenin by Richard Müller and Heinrich Malzahn,
members of the German trade union delegation at the First
International Congress of Revolutionary Trade Unions (July 1921),
over the resolution of the congress on the organisational question
relating to the trade unions in Germany.

Following its establishment, the United Communist Party of
Germany set up communist groups in a]l the trade unions. In an
effort to isolate the Communists from the trade union
membership, the trade union bureaucrats expelled leading Communists
and some local organisations in toto.

Comrade Lobachev

Comrade Rykov, Commission of Workers’ Supply

Chicherin complains that the foreigners are being
deprived of state supplies. He insists that this is absolutely
impossible. I find his arguments serious. Please discuss
whether it would not be desirable to buy certain quantities
of foodstuffs abroad for the arriving foreigners, and to
charge them at a rate that would quite cover our
expenditures.

Chicherin has an even stronger complaint over the 100
rations taken away from the personnel of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. I think that these
rations should in fact be loft, with the P.C.F.A.

Please let rue know what you decide.

I have just read yesterday’s C.P.C. decision on the
matter of the Petrograd port. The text shows that the decision

This question was repeatedly discussed by the C.L.D. and the
Narrow C.P.C. Eventually, the proposal was not accepted,

Comrade Steklov, Izvestia VTsIK Editorial Board

Comrade Ulyanova, Pravda ” ”
Comrade Karpinsky, Bednota ” ”
Comrade Krumin, Ekonomicheskaya
 Zhizn ” ”


Copy to Comrade Smolyaninov

I should like to draw your attention to the “Collection
of Government Statutes and Decrees” No. 44 of 1–VII–1921,
“On Local Economic Conferences, Their Reports and
Guidance by the C.P.C. and the C.L.D. Order” (All-Russia
Central Executive Committee resolution).

There is need to insert a number of articles, stating and
giving a detailed explanation of the importance of this
All-Russia C.E.C. resolution, with special emphasis that
no reporting machinery may be set up, because the law
designates the gubernia and uyezd statistical bureaus as
the only machinery.

Give a detailed exposition of the fundamental
importance of local economic conferences and their reports, which
are published for the information of the public, both for
conducting the new economic policy in general, and for
correct economic operations.

Special stress should be laid on the commodity exchange,
then on the development of local economic initiative, on
combating red tape and on enlisting non-Party people for
economic construction.

I request that ROSTA should send two or three short
wires on this subject to inform all gubernia and uyezd
towns at once, asking them to carry reprints in all local
Party and Soviet newspapers.

I ask the editorial boards of the Moscow papers to send
me either cuttings of articles inserted in accordance with
my present request or separate issues with articles on this
subject, specially underscored.
 

It will be Comrade Smolyaninov’s duty to see that this
is done and to inform me of any questions that may arise
in the process.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.

Send the following telephone message to Rykov;

     (Copy to Smolyaninov)

I consider quite correct your decision to authorise the
People’s Commissariat for Food to set up a special shop
(store) for the sale of foodstuffs (and other things) to
foreigners and Comintern visitors. I propose that it should
be passed through the C.L.D. and expedited in every
way.[1]
The shop should be run on strictly commercial lines, with
an individual manager. Purchases at the shop should be
allowed only to those who arrive from abroad, presenting
their special identity cards and consumer drawing cards.
I assign Smolyaninov to keep a special check on this matter.

Lenin

22/VII.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On July 22, 1921, the C.L.D. examined this question and adopted
a decision under which all foreign missions and individuals
arriving in Russia would be supplied with food at a private
distribution centre set up by the People’s Commissariat for Food, when
presenting special cards registered at the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Affairs.

Please take all resolute measures to secure the earliest

procurement and to clarify all matters connected with the
purchase make use of the presence in Moscow of Comrade
Stomonyakov, the authorised representative of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade in Germany.

Please keep me informed through Comrade Smolyaninov
about all the measures you take to expedite procurement
and purchase of the machinery.

Comrade Mikh. Kruchinsky:

I have received your letter with all the documents
concerning
Gukon.[1]

I am very sorry to say that while you have accused
others of being hysterical, you yourself have (to put it
mildly) succumbed to the mood. Will you please write in
future with greater restraint and deliberation.

With communist greetings,

Lenin

Central Administration of Horse Breeding (Gukon) of the
People’s Commissariat for Agriculture, who said the horse-breeding
industry was in a grave state due to the bad work of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture.

The peasants of Samara
and Simbirsk gubernias have
expressed a great desire to work in
harvesting teams in the
grain-producing gubernias, and are
acting as inspector-agitators in the
collection of the tax in kind in
the grain-producing gubernias.
The speediest solution of the
question is desirable. Inform
Samara and Simbirsk of this....


Belkin
Chairman, All-Russia C.E.C.
Commission
Bryukhanov, Avanesov
and Molotov

Please arrange a small
conference on the
underscored (XX) most
important question:

Bryukhanov + Avanesov +
Molotov and pass through
the C.L.D. right away.

This is extremely
important.
It is necessary and useful.

Comrade Potyaev:

I am sure you have read this
already?[1] Have a look
at my remarks and send at once (this very day) to Avanesov.

You should arrange a short conference with Avanesov
on Monday or Tuesday, interrogate the accused
((Nepryakhin and someone from the leading workers at the All-Russia
Central T.U.C.)), and have them (both accused) give short
depositions in writing and introduce in the C.L.D. on
Wednesday, 27/VII.
 

1) Severe reprimand and, I think, personal arrest for
Nepryakhin and the person from the All-Russia Central
T.U.C. guilty of red tape, mismanagement, and breach of
the C.L.D. order.

2) A number of precise proposals, practical and
businesslike, to expedite the shipment of fish, and to assure the
success of the autumn fishing in Astrakhan district.

24/VII.

With communist greetings,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the report, “The Present Slate and the Immediate
Prospects of the Astrakhan State Fishing industry”, given on
June 16, 1921, by I. P. Babkin, the C.L.D. agent for the fishing
season in Astrakhan.

For Lenin’s remarks and markings on Babkin’s report see
Lenin Miscellany XX, pp. 293–98.

On July 27, 1921, the C.L.D. adopted its decision, “On
Measures to Improve the Fishing Industry and Transportation of
Fish”, which also established the forms of relations between the
Central Administration of the Fishing Industry and the People’s
Commissariat for Food.

Comrade Potyaev:

Has your squabble with the People’s Commissariat for
Food been entirely eliminated? Every trace of it must be
wiped out.

Write me about this.

I send you Babkin’s report with my remarks and
proposals.

I hope your relations with Babkin have not been spoiled
by this squabble.

On Wednesday, a number of precise and urgent measures
for the autumn fishing season must be passed through the
C.L.D.

Buy some of the things abroad if this cannot be avoided.

Phone me on Tuesday or Wednesday morning—you can
do this from my office.

And what about the sale of caviar abroad?

With communist greetings,

Lenin

Comrade Bryukhanov:

Have you quite normalised relations with Potyaev? Have
you erased every trace of the squabble? That is imperative.

I am not blaming you for the squabble, but someone
(? who?) on the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat
for Food. I don’t know who was chiefly to blame. I think
your fault lies in weakness: you should have found the
squabbler and given him a severe drubbing in public,
letting me sign a paper issuing him a reprimand. I believe
there is a trouble-maker on the Collegium of the People’s
Commissariat for Food!

With communist greetings,

Lenin

Comrade Babkin:

I have received and read your papers.

Give your business proposals concerning the shipment of
fish and the success of the autumn fishing right away (25/VII)
to Avanesov for introduction in the C.L.D. (and to Potyaev,
of course, in the first place).

We shall let you have a holiday, if the doctor says so,
and puts it in writing that the holiday cannot be deferred
until the winter. Otherwise you can have it in winter.

I advise you to have a personal talk with Potyaev and
to remove his doubts about “rivalry” on your part.
Everything will be settled if you want it.

Who is it specifically of the “local” workers that is
dissatisfied with Potyaev? Why? When and where has this
been stated?
 

I don’t believe it: this is nothing but a squabble; we
shall settle it.

24/VII.

With communist greetings,

Lenin

Comrade Rykov (return to me)

Comrade Rykov:

I think Babkin should be reproved and left to do his
job (since he agrees to have Potyaev at the S.E.C., the
whole thing is nothing but a squabble and a lot of gossip).

Obtain a paper on Babkin’s illness from a good doctor:
put off his holiday until the winter, if possible; if it
cannot be put off, let him go at once, but put an obligation
on him to receive serious treatment.

I am writing separately to Potyaev and
Avanesov[1]

about
his business proposals for introduction in the C.L.D. on
27/VII.

Comrade Osinsky
(with a request to read and pass on to Comrade Teodorovich)

The author, Comrade Fofanova, has been a member of
the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture.
 

I am not proposing her for this post.

She is a Party comrade who had passed the supreme test
even before October 1917.

She is an agronomist.

I think we must make use of her: ask her to come and
see you, have a talk, and think it over. She could be put
to local work or as an inspector.

There are so few Party comrades among agronomists,
and the milieu (agronomists) is so “alien”, that a Party
member should be grasped at with both hands to help us
to keep an eye on this milieu, check up on it, and attract
this milieu towards us.

Drop me a line when you decide what to do.

Lenin 

P.S. Please return Fofanova’s letter.

I have learned from Chicherin’s letter that you have
prepared a pamphlet or a series of articles on the
Georgian
question.[2] Have you made use of the resolution of the
1919 Menshevik conference, holding the bloc between the
Georgian Mensheviks and the Entente to be inadmissible
and condemning this bloc?

If you do not have this resolution, I could get it for you.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This and the following documents were written in connection with
G. V. Chicherin’s letter to M. M. Scheinman on the need to speed
up the writing of an article exposing Georgian Mensheviks, and
a request for some partial sketches of the diplomatic aspect of
the Georgian conflict.

Menshevik Paradise. Impressions of a Trip to Georgia, published in 1921.

Presidium of the Moscow Soviet
Copies to Sorokin, Gubernia Statistical Bureau,
Gubernia Economic Council
and Gubernia Trade Union Council

1. There is very great doubt about the correctness of
the data submitted to me by Sorokin today concerning
the 30 per cent
reduction,[1]

2. There is equal doubt about it being right to carry
out the cuts, in the sense that the axe is being put to the
wrong groups. The reduction should fall on the enterprises
and establishments which are not absolutely essential.

3. Sorokin’s reference to there allegedly being no data
about the groups of enterprises and establishments which
are not absolutely essential shows that things at the
Gubernia Statistical Bureau, the Gubernia Trade Union
Council and the Gubernia Economic Council are extremely
unsatisfactory.

Please let me have exact data and a precise explanation
for tomorrow’s sitting of the Council of People’s Commissars
(26.VII.21).

A reference to the report from the Moscow Gubernia Food
Commissar P. S. Sorokin on the fulfilment by the Moscow
Consumers’ Commune of the C.P.C. decision of July 12, 1921, to reduce
by 30 per cent the number of persons on the supply list in view
of the grave food situation. On July 26, the C.P.C. set up a
commission to verify the work by the Moscow Consumers’ Commune.
It was authorised, in particular, to find out whether it was
expedient to remove from the ration list the categories of persons
as designated by the commune, or whether it was possible to
remove all non-working persons of Moscow.

Comrade Molotov:

Re: the draft agreement concerning the Dashnaks which
Joffe initialled in
Riga.[1] I quite agree with Chicherin’s
arguments and propose that the agreement should be
resolutely and immediately rejected. I propose the immediate
passage by phone of this resolution: “The draft agreement
signed by Joffe and other comrades in Riga concerning
the Dashnaks is hereby resolutely and immediately
rejected.”

I believe Chicherin is absolutely right when he says
that such an agreement is not only wrong, but dangerous.

Comrade Krasin
Copy to Comrade Chicherin

Klyshko has sent a telegram to your address on the 21st,
saying that substantial assistance to Russia can be got
through only in the event of a more or less favourable
attitude to the Soviet Government on the part of Britain’s
government
circles.[1] I very much fear that Klyshko is
taking the wrong approach and is allowing himself to be
involved in inadmissible promises or statements. We don’t
care about Britain’s government circles. Klyshko should
be taken to task, and made to use his head.

Comrade Chicherin:

1) If Lunacharsky + Krasin were in favour, they should
have been made to carry the whole thing,

2) Why are you being burdened with these trifles? Where
is Gorbunov or his deputy? After all, it is their business!!

3) A decree was adopted (a few days ago): to set up a
shop (store) for foreigners. Gorbunov (or his deputy) should
handle this and the flats (+ Krasin).

With communist greetings,

Written in connection with G. V. Chicherin’s letter of July 24,
1921, saying that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs
had had to make arrangements for Isadora Duncan, the actress
who had arrived in Russia at the invitation of A. V. Lunacharsky
and L. B. Krasin. Chicherin argued that the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs did not have the duty to make
arrangements for foreigners coming to Russia who were not connected
with official missions.

Comrade Borodin:

Your note is very interesting. I think you should put
the finishing touches to it (as, you yourself hope to do)
to turn it into an article for Communist International or
a pamphlet.

Collect all the material. Throw out the polemics against
Communists. Make it explanatory, not polemical—it could
be a most useful
thing.[1]


With communist greetings,

Lenin

Central Statistical Board

I request the head of the industrial statistics
department to let me have the following data as soon as possible:

1) what data are coming in to the department of
current industrial statistics and how often;

2) from how many big establishments;

3) the percentage (even if only a rough one) of correct
reports and short statements coming in;

4) for which recent months there are satisfactory data;

5) when can I have the shortest abstract of the latest
data relating only to the main branches of industry;

6) are the few very big establishments brought together
under a separate head, if they are, how many are there of
them and what data are available on them.

28/VII.1921.   

Comrade Zinoviev:

In view of a number of statements made by Zetkin,
I regard the conversation I had with her yesterday, before
her departure, to be so important that I must inform you
of it.

She wants to set Levi two conditions:

1) resign his parliamentary seat;

2) close down his organ
(Sowiet[2] or Unser Weg, as
I believe it is now called), issuing a statement of loyalty

    

in respect of the decisions of the Third Congress of the
Communist International.

Furthermore, she is afraid that it could occur to some
friend of Levi’s to publish Rosa Luxemburg’s manuscript
against the Bolsheviks (which I think she wrote in prison
in 1918). If anyone should do this, she intends to make a
statement in the press that she is quite sure such an act
is disloyal. She would say that she had known Rosa
Luxemburg best of all, and is sure that she herself admitted
these views to be erroneous, that she admitted, upon her
release from prison, that she had been insufficiently
informed.

In addition, Léon Jogiches, Rosa Luxemburg’s closest
friend, in a detailed talk with Zetkin, two days before
he died, told her about this manuscript of Rosa
Luxemburg’s, and about Rosa Luxemburg herself admitting that
it was
wrong.[3] Zetkin was going to write you about this
at my request.

If she has done so, please send me her letter.

Another interesting point, according to her, is that there
is a wave of unification of all workers (both S.D.P. and
U.S.P.-Leute) in the struggle against
Lohnabbau,[1]

etc.
Of course, Zetkin was quite right in saying that the
Communists should back this unification in the struggle against
the capitalists. If the “Lefts” should object, they should
he made to see reason.

With communist greetings,

Lenin

Zinoviev

P.S. Lozovsky has already published the Congress
resolutions of the Red International of Trade Unions. Well
done!

What about you?? Appoint a person to be responsible for
editing, and get Lozovsky to publish the resolutions of
the Third Congress of the Communist International.

Sowiet—a monthly published in Berlin from 1919 to July 1, 1921,
under the editorship of Paul Levi. Following Levi’s expulsion
from the United Communist Party of Germany, the journal, from
July 1, changed its orientation and was published under the name
of Unser Weg. At the end of 1922 it ceased publication.

The draft theses provided that the whole of Soviet policy in
Bukhara and Khiva should be implemented only through the
plenipotentiary representatives of Russia; the measures taken by the
Turkestan Commission were to be agreed with these
representatives and, on especially important matters, with the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

On August 5, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee endorsed the draft theses.

My opinion is:

Set up a small commission to work out
the plan in detail. Approve in substance.
Ascertain more precisely the amount
of the loan, the dates and the terms
of repayment in raw materials and
timber (first year, in our gold: 30 million
rubles in gold; we could make it two
years at 30 million rubles in gold). Ten
per cent a year with repayment? Isn’t
that too much?

This was written on L. B. Krasin’s letter of July 27, 1921,
reporting on the terms of an agreement with the British
shipbuilding companies, who were prepared to grant Soviet Russia a
longterm credit for the building of ships for the Black Sea, Caspian
and the Volga merchant fleet and the Mariinsk Waterway. In
this connection, Krasin proposed that these companies or the
British Government extend an additional credit to cover the
purchase of equipment, and suggested that a plan should be worked
out to use credit for the rehabilitation of the national
economy.

Comrade Molotov:

I wrote you about the need to punish Badayev (for
frustrating the C.L.D. decision; fulfilled by the
Muscovites).[1]

You have not replied.

Such things must he settled speedily.

Kamenev and Zinoviev agree. Write the minutes of the
Politbureau decision for the passage through the Presidium
of the All-Russia C.E.C.: “For failure to fulfil a C.L.D.
decision (on reducing rations by 30 per cent)—which the
Muscovites have carried out—Comrade Badayev + two of
his closest assistants shall be placed under detention for
one Sunday.”

That will give us “control”!!

Comrade Vashkov, Electrical Department, S.E.C.

Copy to Comrade Krzhizhanovsky

I thank you very much for the article, “Electrification
of Russia” in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn of
10/VII.[1]

It is highly important that such information should
appear in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn and in the popular press
from time to time. If you happen to have it, please send
me the following additional information: 1) your table
shows the electric-power station capacity in 1920 as being
7,670 kw. Does this include Shatura’s 5,000 kw?

2) Your article shows that in 1920 the Tula group
yielded 3,000 kw. Is that reflected in the table, or is such
information not included?

3) Is it possible to bring out the larger stations which
are of real industrial importance, say, those of 1,000 kw
or those of a size which could be classed as large and which
are of importance to industry?

4) For how many months of 1921 do you have
consolidated tables in which 1921 is shown at all?

5) Do you happen to have any details on the early
stages of organisation of the Shterovka, Ivanovo-Voznesensk,
Nizhni-Novgorod and Chelyabinsk stations?

6) Your article says that the combination of several
large stations could give Moscow 10,000 kw. Please let me
know whether it has actually done so, exactly how much
and when?

7) Could you let me have some details about the power
stations in Bolshevo district, near Mytishchi, and the
Detskoye Selo station, which supplies Petrograd, and more
exact information about the time of their expected
completion?

Please let me know also whether the forthcoming
Electro-technical Congress in
October[2] could be used to collect
fuller and more precise information about all the existing
electro-technical stations, their distribution by uyezd and
gubernia, the time of their establishment, the number of

    

stations being used to teach electricity and electrification,
etc.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the article referred to, N. N. Vashkov gave a short review of
what had been done in the sphere of electrification, giving a table
to show the growth of urban and rural electric-power stations
from 1917 to 1921. He also spoke of the work started locally to
explore the power resources and the requirements in the
electrification.





[2]
A reference to the Eighth All-Russia Electrotechnical Congress,
which was called on Lenin’s initiative in pursuance of the
resolution of the Eighth Congress of Soviets, to hold a comprehensive
discussion of technical and economic problems connected with
the implementation of the GOELRO plan. Before the congress,
a telegram was sent to all the Gubernia Executive Committees
instructing their electrical departments to send in, with their
delegates, information about all the existing electric-power stations
(see this volume, Document 327).

Comrade Myasnikov:

I read your article, which Bukharin passed on to me,
only today, and very cursorily.

I should like to have a talk with you. I hope to be in
Moscow one of these days and find time for a half-hour
talk with you.

The beginning of your article is good and business-like.

But there are some obvious errors in your conclusions.

Perhaps there is some misunderstanding: it looks as if
you hare failed to say in the article what you had told
N. I. Bukharin. What sort of “freedom of the press” do
you want? Under the law? For workers too—S.R.s and
Mensheviks? Just now? The article does not make it
clear.[1]

Drop me a line.

With communist greetings,

Lenin

Martens

I have received a telegram from Riga about the
congress of societies in the United States and Canada for

    

technical aid to Soviet Russia, which Golos
Rossii?[1] of New
York says was held there early in
July.[2]

According to this report, the congress sent a telegram
of greetings to Martens and the People’s Commissars, and
announced in this telegram its decision to start organising
technical teams for dispatch to Soviet Russia right away.

I think I should send them a telegram on these lines:

“Having learned from the New York Golos Rossii about
your congress and its telegram of greetings to Soviet
Russia, I express, on behalf of the C.P.C., our heart-felt
gratitude.

“Let me add, on my own behalf: we are greatly in need
of technical aid from the United States and Canada. If
teams are to be sent without agreement in advance
concerning the place of settlement, factory, etc., the team must
have a two-year supply of food, clothing, etc. Each team
must be prepared to do both agricultural and industrial
work. The best thing is to have delegates sent ahead for
an on-the-spot inspection of land tracts for settlement,
forest tracts, mines, factories, etc., for lease.”

Lenin
Chairman, C.P.C.

This requires the signatures of Martens and the People’s
Commissariat for Labour, and Bogdanov’s and Chicherin’s
are also desirable.

The Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia was organised in
May 1919 by Russian émigrés in New York. Similar societies
were set up elsewhere in the U.S.A. and Canada. The aim of the
Society was to promote the rehabilitation of the Soviet economy
by sending skilled workers and technicians.

The first congress of the societies for technical aid to Soviet
Russia was hold in New York from July 2 to 4, 1921; it united
local societies in several American and Canadian cities into a
single Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia. From the end
of 1921 to October 1922, the Society sent to Soviet Russia seven
agricultural, two construction and one mining communes and a
number of groups which brought with them equipment, seeds and

   

foodstuffs worth nearly $500,000. The Society was extending its
activity, and by 1923 it had more than 75 branches with over
20,000 members. Its second congress in June 1923 adopted a
decision to intensify its work of organising and sending in communes
and preparatory groups of skilled workers to Russia. The Society
continued its active economic aid until 1925.

Lenin regarded this activity as a striking expression of
proletarian internationalism and fraternal solidarity of the working
people.

I have received your communication No. 7772 of July
29. Please let me have the information available at the
C.S.B. for 1920 (and for a part of 1921, if also available)
in the most concise form, namely: 1) to how many
gubernias and to what period do the data apply; 2) totals for
manufactured output; 3) total fuel consumption.
 

Only these three figures and only for the key branches
of industry (for instance, textile, metallurgy, paper,
electro-technical goods, salt and rubber).

Total results if available. Show data from central boards
and those direct from the factories separately.

Comrade Chicherin:

Who is this Ionov?

How can he propose Mensheviks and Socialist-
Revolutionaries?[1]

This seems to show or reveal something thoroughly evil.

What do you think ?

With communist greetings,

Lenin

wrote: “Under no circumstances.”

4/VIII.   

Comrade Frumkin:

The whole thing now seems to hinge on the speedy
collection of the tax in kind.

Perhaps we should, in addition to what has been done,
undertake something on these lines:

1) reinforce military units (assign half the trainees in

    

Moscow Gubernia to
this),[1]

i.e., assign them to food
supply work?

2) the same thing, especially in Moscow and
neighbouring gubernias?

3) feed these units (and food detachments, which I think
now have some different name: “militia promoting the
collection of the tax in kind” or something like that?) at the
expense of the local peasants at two pounds a day? or three
pounds a day?

You don’t want this, comrades peasants, do you? Let’s
have the grain tax fast. As soon as you deliver 50–75 per
cent, we shall start pulling them out!

4) pass a resolution (or perhaps, instead of a
“resolution”, stage an experiment and set up a model in Moscow
Gubernia);

mete out instant, exemplary and highly severe
punishment to 10 of the richest peasants per volost for any delay,
however slight, over the tax in kind or for slack delivery
of the tax in kind;

———ditto—mete out exemplary punishment to one
volost per uyezd, or two-three per gubernia, for slack
deliveries of the tax in kind?

5) issue a bonus for 100 per cent collection of tax (grain)
within two or three weeks. Bonus in what form? In gold
or silver things. We can get them at the State Depository
of Valuables.

6) make an effort to mobilise for the collection of the
tax in kind in Moscow Gubernia another 2 or 3 hundred
of the most responsible Party members, if only for raids
(check-ups, pressure) twice a week?

With communist greetings,

Lenin

P.S. I am writing you and not Bryukhanov in the hope
that he has already gone on holiday. If he has not, of
course, read this out to him as well.

In view of the detailed and formal protest lodged by
Comrade Chicherin against the dispatch of the
enclosed
telegram[1] please call an additional conference consisting
of Comrade Martens, a representative of the People’s
Commissariat for Labour who is informed on the question, and
a representative of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs, also informed on the question. A total of four
persons, including yourself.

Please have the conference discuss Chicherin’s objections
and pay special attention to the demand stated in the
telegram that enough food should be brought along for
two years.

I think that if we were to add a few words about the
fight against hardship and privation in Russia and the
uselessness of sending over people who are unable to bear
them, the telegram would be only to the good. Please send
me a very short resolution in writing not later than
tomorrow night.

Tsentropechat[1]

is sending to the localities No. 44 of the
Collection of Statutes, containing the C.L.D. Order. The
Order is first of all intended for gubernia, uyezd, district
and volost economic conferences. I insist most strongly
that you should make a special and strict check-up to see
that the C.L.D. Order is received by the volost and district
economic conferences; and wherever such do not exist, by
the volost executive committees. It shall be the personal
responsibility of the chairmen and the secretaries of
gubernia economic conferences and uyezd economic
conferences to see that the volost executive committees receive
the Order. I emphasise the absolute necessity of taking the
C.L.D. Order all the way down to the volost and the
village, to give the broad masses of peasants an opportunity
to learn of the latest All-Russia C.E.C. resolution. The
gubernia economic conferences are ordered to take steps
to dispatch telegrams to the uyezd economic conferences,
and the gubernia and uyezd Tsentropechat branches.

Comrade Krasin

I have received a copy of your letter to Dzerzhinsky
concerning shipbuilding. I agree with you that we should
not now build seagoing steamships. I believe that military
considerations indicate the same thing. It is undoubtedly
necessary to intensify the construction of tankers for the
oil fleet, especially in the Caspian Sea and on the Volga.
I ask you to:

1) request an official Gosplan opinion on this matter;

2) ratify a precise decision at an official conference of
the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the
People’s Commissariat for Railways, and, if there is any
other department concerned, include it as well.

I have been heaping curses on your head for your whining
and unbusiness-like attitude. Concerning Meisner, you
should have made a formal and written inquiry of
Bryukhanov and, given his disagreement, introduced (a copy of his
reply) in the C.L.D.

There is no point in dragging it out: this is what helps
to spread gossip to which you succumb. You must make
use of your rights and stop whimpering. I expect you to
let me have your official telephone message about Meisner
tomorrow.

Concerning the Party request, table it officially in the
Orgbureau, as soon as possible. This has nothing to do
with me You can lodge an appeal in the Politbureau.

    

I have not yet read the “plan”. Set out for me on two pages
the differences between N. M. Knipovich and
Meisner.[1]

With communist greetings,

Lenin

[1]

N. M. Knipovich, an industrial research specialist, was of the        

opinion that V. I. Meisner, Head of the Central Administration        

of the Fishing Industry, was hampering the initiative of other        

establishments in scientific-industrial research, and that his        

Administration was conducting an incorrect policy on fisheries.       

Knipovich said all this in a letter to Lenin on August 6, 1921, on    

which Lenin made his remarks (see Lenin Miscellany XXIII,    

pp. 164–67).

Nikolai Mikhailovich Knipovich
(8 Bolshoi Kozikhinsky)

I regret very much that because of my illness I was
unable to talk with you when you came to see Nadezhda
Konstantinovna. Will you let me have in a few short words:
1) your assessment of Meisner a) from the standpoint of
honesty, b) from the political standpoint, c) business
qualifications, d) executive capacity and 2) your differences
with Glavryba. 3) Your proposals, if you have any,
concerning decentralisation in the fishing industry and its
organisation in Murmansk.

Urgent

Comrade Smolyaninov

Please read my letter on the back of this and get it through
the C.L.D. (with a Gosplan opinion) with the utmost
speed, in two to four days.

5/8.

Lenin

N.B.:

To get it through fast do the following:

1) Make 2–3 copies. Send one right away to
Krzhizhanovsky, asking him for an opinion by Tuesday;

2) Circulate to C.L.D. members at once, and see to it
that they read it fast, making their remarks on their copies
right away;

3) Ask the C.L.D. members by telephone whether they
agree to hand in the preliminary project to a commission—
Krasin + Avanesov + Bogdanov (or someone specially
authorised by him).

Lenin

I consider the plan correct and subject to immediate
approval. Perhaps it may be desirable to have some further
specifications and additions, such as:

1) let them have the circulating capital in gold, but
only from our export earnings for 1921, charging the group
in question to expedite the realisation of this export;

2) specify with greater precision the “leased” area for the
given group, taking mostly, or even exclusively, the very
far north (this is more convenient for us, because it will
spare us the need to send food over there; it is more
convenient politically, because the preferential terms for the
workers—up to 50 kopeks in gold!!—will cause less envy
and fewer collisions among the other workers);

3) give more precise definitions of the group’s obligations:
fulfil no less than a given programme (both in production
and in export in 1922 and especially 1923);

4) bind the “group” to try to abide by the interests of

    

electrification (buy more foreign equipment for the
electric-power stations, make use of saw-dust, etc.)—the interests
of Russia’s fuel supply (fuel branch-lines; increased
supplies of fuel and firewood to Moscow, etc.);

5) let the group have what it asks in the sphere of
financial and material independence.

5/VIII. 1921.

Lenin

These documents were written in connection with the report of
July 20, 1921, from S. I. Liberman, an expert of the
Concessions Committee under the State Planning Commission, proposing
that the administration of the Archangel forest district be
transferred to a group of forestry specialists, who were to operate with
the rights of a state establishment while retaining some freedom
commercially.

On August 17, 1921, the C.L.D. adopted a decision on the
administrative organs for the timber industry of the
Severo-Belomorsky District, under which a special body—Severoles—was set
up within the system of the Chief Timber Committee.

Vladimirov:
We have established high rates in the Ukraine on the
west bank of the Dnieper. This entails heavy risks. We are taking
the following measures: to involve the volost economic conferences
in the work of discussing a number of questions of interest to the
countryside, but we are simultaneously faced with the question of salt,
considering its present shortage. The question comes to this: are we
to give salt regardless of the payment of tax (this is official),
actually, however, giving it first of all to those volosts which have
successfully started to collect the tax; let me add that I think it right to sell
for ready cash even now. Let me have your opinion.

Lenin: First: I advise the sale of salt only for grain, and
not for cash in any case.

Second: Sell salt only to those volosts, villages or
individual farmers who have paid in at least a quarter or half
the tax.

Third: I think that the successful collection of tax
requires military units to help it, with these military units
receiving larger rations at the expense of the local peasants,
until the tax has been paid.

Fourth: Let me know what the food situation is in the
Donbas, how well it is supplied, and for how long.

Vladimirov:
On the first two questions I maintain the same stand.

Concerning military force, please have a talk with Frunze, who
has gone to Moscow.

As for the Donbas, we have four routes for it. We are taking steps
to get some locomotives. I believe we shall be able to start regular
supplies not later than the 12th.
 

Lenin: Maintaining the first stand is not enough. You
must have a formal C.C. decision. If you cannot obtain
it from your C.C. you must get it through the C.C. here.
The same applies to the rules of using armed force.

Concerning the Donbas, let me have the briefest and
most precise reports twice a week about the quantity of
foodstuffs in hand.

Vladimirov:
I think this matter can be best decided with
Rakovsky and Frunze, who have gone to Moscow. My opinion is on record.

7/VIII.

Comrade Tomsky:

Thank you very much for the letter which is very clear.

Of course, you are right that we in Moscow must have
“9 million
sheep”.[2] They must be obtained at all costs!
Send us at the C.L.D. a calendar programme of their
receipt at once.

The same about grain.

We are sending Comrade Joffe in an attempt to settle
your differences with Comrade Safarov.

I believe the two tendencies can and must be combined:

1) the first priority is grain and meat for Moscow;

2) (for this) a number of concessions and bonuses to the
“merchants”;

3) no question about the new economic policy (10th
Congress, Conference of May 1921, etc.);

4) Moslem poor peasants’ committees indispensable, and

5) the Moslem poor should be treated with care and
prudence, with a number of concessions.

It is possible and necessary to combine and consolidate
the line of wisdom and prudence, maintaining the interests
of our “world policy” throughout the East.

With communist greetings,

Lenin
 

P.S. The C.C. will probably agree to your request
concerning the half-year. We shall have a talk with
Rudzutak.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written in connection with a letter from M. P. Tomsky,
Chairman of the Commission of the All-Russia C.E.C. and the
C.P.C. of the R.S.F.S.R. for Turkestan affairs, of July 23, 1921,
setting out his differences with G. I. Safarov, member of the
Turkestan Bureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee, on
implementing the New Economic Policy in Turkestan. Tomsky
insisted on introducing the tax in kind and believed it was
impossible to combine the New Economic Policy with the
establishment in Turkestan of Committees of Poor Peasants and their
sharing out of the property, cattle and stock requisitioned
from the kulaks. Safarov, for his part, insisted that the tax in
kind and free exchange were not quite applicable to Turkestan
conditions, and laid emphasis on organising unions of the poor
and the class stratification of the local population.

For details on this question see also this volume, Document
383; Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 53,
Documents 175 and 259.





[2]
A reference to the purchase of sheep from cattle-breeding traders
in Turkestan and China to supply meat to the population of
Moscow. It later turned out, however, that the deal was
disadvantageous. In a telegram sent to M. P. Tomsky on September 19,
1921, which was signed by Lenin, he was ordered to stop
further purchases of cattle (see Lenin Miscellany XXIII, p. 136).

Our houses are terribly fouled up. The law is not worth
a damn. There must be a tenfold more precise and fuller
indication of the persons,responsible (not one, but many,
one after another), and remorseless incarceration.

I do not agree without these additions:

1) apart from the manager, the responsibility shall also
fall on his “deputy”.

There must be a deputy;

2) apart from them, the responsibility shall also fall on
a control commission consisting of tenants. There must be
such a commission. At least three persons, who should
always be available, or their deputies.

3) All these persons shall be subject both to legal and
to administrative responsibility.

That is not enough.

This must also be added:

1) responsibility of the tenants for failure to elect a
manager and his “deputy”;

2) ditto, for failure to elect a control commission;

3) it shall be the duty of the manager and his deputy
and the control commission to see that a responsible person
(either the manager himself or his deputy or a member
of the control commission) is on duty daily

apart from specially employed persons (yard-keeper, etc.)
where such are employed;

4) responsibility of tenants in houses of less than 10
flats.

How is the tenants’ responsibility to be established? This
must be considered, and a way found.

Notes
 
 



[1]
These notes were written by Lenin in connection with the
regulations “On House Management”, adopted by the Narrow C.P.C.
on August 8, 1921, which made the house manager most
responsible for the good repair of housing facilities. On August 12 and
22, 1921, the Narrow C.P.C. examined the question of
elaborating the additional measures proposed by Lenin to enhance
responsibility for the maintenance of houses in good repair.

9.VIII.1921

Comrade Bokii:

In your letter about Shelekhes (Yakov Savelyevich) you
say: “many are putting in a word for him”, including
Lenin, and you request “permission to ignore all petitions
and pressures on the Gokhran
case”.[1]

This is something I cannot allow.

The inquiry I sent in is neither “intercession”, nor
“pressure”, nor even “petition”.

It is my duty to inquire, once doubt about the
correctness of the proceedings has been brought up with me.

It is your duty to give me a reply in substance: “the
reasons or the evidence are serious, they are such-and-such,

    

I object, to his release, to any mitigation” and so on and so
forth.

Those are the lines, in substance, on which you must
reply to me.

You are free to reject any petitions and “intercessions”;
“pressure” is an unlawful act. But, I repeat, it is a
mistake on your part to have confused an inquiry from the
Chairman of the C.P.C., and a petition, intercession or
pressure.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Gokhran (State Depository of Valuables) case mentioned in
the letter arose as a result, of the discovery of a large shortage of
diamonds. Gokhran valuer, Y. S. Shelekhes, was accused of
stealing valuables and was arrested by the All-Russia Cheka. On
August 8, 1921, Lenin sent an inquiry to Deputy Chairman of
the All-Russia Cheka, I. S. Unschlicht, over Shelekhes’s arrest
and received a reply on August 9, from G. I. Bokii, a member
of the Collegium of the Cheka. The present letter was written by
Lenin in connection with his unsatisfactory reply.

See this volume, Documents 173, 180, 216 and 221; and also

9/VIII.1921 

Alexei Maximovich:

I have sent your letter on to L. B.
Kamenev.[1]

I am so tired that I am unable to do a thing.

Just think, you have been spitting blood, but refuse to
go!! This is truly most shameless and unreasonable on your
part.

In a good sanatorium in Europe, you will receive
treatment, and also do three times as much useful work.

Really and truly.

Over here you have neither treatment, nor
work—nothing but hustle.
Plain empty hustle.

Go away and recover. I beg you not to be stubborn.

Yours,
Lenin

11/VIII.

Comrade Molotov:

It is absolutely necessary to appoint a special
commission from the Politbureau:

Kamenev

Trotsky

Molotov (with the right of his substitution by
Chicherin) for the day-to-day handling of matters connected with
aid to the starving from America and the League of Nations.

This game is an extremely intricate one. There is rank
duplicity on the part of America, Hoover and the League
of Nations Council.

Hoover must be punished, he must be slapped in the face
publicly, for all the world to see, and the League of Nations
Council as well.

This is very hard to do, but it must be done.

I can’t work. There is absolute need of help from
Trotsky, who has a capacity for these things (both
diplomatic experience and a military and political instinct).

Please have a vote taken in the Politbureau at once by
telephone.

Show this note to everyone and get their votes.

Lenin

The German and Norwegian governments could be taken
as models.

Any other approach should be rejected with a motivation
which is clear to all, and this should be loudly proclaimed
to the whole world.

The disguised interventionists must be caught (have
Uuschlicht help out).

The Kompomoshch[1]

apparatus must be tightened up (if
there is a shortage of men, borrow some from the military
for two months).
 

Collegial work is of especial importance in the next few
days, because the political responsibility for this very
difficult matter is enormous.

Lenin

P. S. Our moves must be subtle. A number of especially
strict measures. Hoover and Brown are liars and
brazen-faced fellows.

The conditions must be of the strictest: arrest and
deportation for the slightest interference in our internal
affairs.

Bogdanov, copy to Kursky’s Deputy

I have great doubts about S.K.F. (Swedish Ball-Bearing
Company). Has there been an adequate statement of the
legal side of the matter, i.e., has our interest been
maintained?

This interest requires that we should not allow the
slightest relaxation of the principle that we are the owners of
all the nationalised enterprises and warehouses. These
enterprises and warehouses could pass into the hands of their
former owners only through their formally buying these
warehouses from us. We may sometimes make a concession
by letting them have these enterprises and warehouses at a
low price, but we can never waive our right in the property.

Please have this matter verified with especial care from
the said angle. It is my special request that the verification
should be carried out at the People’s Commissariat for
Justice, where Kursky himself was informed of and handled
the matter, and it is necessary either to look for Kursky
or find someone at the People’s Commissariat for Justice
who is at least as knowledgeable as Kursky.

In view of the fact that the low-down American
hucksters are trying to create the impression that we could be
expected to cheat, 
 

I propose that we should immediately telegraph them
officially, on behalf of the government, over the signatures
of Kamenev and Chicherin (and if necessary Kalinin’s and
mine as well), 

the following:

we shall deposit with a New York bank an amount in
gold constituting 120 per cent of what they will supply in
the course of a month for one million starving children and
sick persons. But in that case, considering such a complete
material guarantee, we stipulate that the Americans must
absolutely refrain not only from political but also from
administrative interference, and must make no claims
whatsoever. This means that in that case all the terms of the
treaty giving them the least right to interfere even if only
administratively shall be void. On-the-spot check-ups are
to be made by parity commissions (representing our
government and
them).[1]

This proposal will show the hucksters just where they
stand, and subsequently disgrace them in the eyes of the
whole world.

We should not forget that we have never had rationing
of any kind in the countryside. If we are to make no
mistake on this score, I suggest we invite someone from the
People’s Commissariat for Food to discuss the matter.

13/VIII.

Dear Comrade Rothstein:

I received your letter of 17/VII only yesterday.

I seem to be in full agreement with your circumspect
policy in Persia. I have not heard the “other side”, but I do
not think that your main considerations could be refuted.

Why don’t you write a work on Persia, to give us all a

    

chance to make a study of such an interesting subject,
which is so obscure for all of us?

It is extremely important to elaborate a line of work
in the East.

I write no more, as you will know the news from the
newspapers, I am now on holiday: I have overworked and
am taking a cure.

I hope that Belgov has already reached you.

With him I wrote you about Alexander Alexandrovich
and Varvara Alexandrovna Armand, who went with him, and
about whom I am very anxious. I hope that they will prove
to be useful in Persia, and that you will be able to
devote some little time to them.

My best regards and wishes.

Lenin

This should be put before the Full C.P.C. and checked.

The penalties may only be increased.

G. M.:

Please return all this with your opinion in a couple of
words.

I find Vashkov’s reply
unsatisfactory.[2]
Perhaps we should send a telegram from the C.L.D.:
to all gubernia executive committees for their electrical
departments, etc.

Do not fail at once to appoint two or three responsible
persons for submitting to the Electrotechnical Congress in
X. 1921 full statistics on electric-power stations with data
on the time of their establishment, number of kilowatts,
fuel, consumption, arrangement of lectures or readings at
the stations, etc.

Lenin

we?[1]

The Editorial Boards of Izvestia and Pravda
and Comrade Ipatiev 

The newspapers Izvestia and Pravda carried an item a
few days ago about the unused resources of
Kara-Bugaz.[1]
May I ask you to tell the author or to let him know through

    

the newspaper, that it is very important for me to have
detailed information both about how well the author is
technically prepared for this matter, and about how long
he had studied the question on the spot.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Goldebayev’s article “Our Resources” (Pravda
No. 178, August 13, 1921). In a reply letter to Lenin on August
20, 1S21, V. N. Ipatiev, Chief of the S.E.C.’s Chemical Industry
Department, said that despite the vast raw material resources of
the Gulf of Kara-Bugaz, their practical use was being made
difficult because of the lack of water and the shortage of fuel and
transport facilities in the area.

The commercial extraction of sodium sulphate was started in
1924. Today, the area has become a major source of mineral raw
materials required for the chemical industry and other branches
of the national economy. See also this volume, Document 410.

Comrades Frumkin, Avanesov and Stalin

I have read your draft decree on salt. I am surprised by
the great number of points which, in my opinion, are
already to be found in the legislation in force, which are an
unnecessary repetition, and which do not come within the
competence of the C.L.D. Unless I am mistaken, the only
new and practically useful point is the prohibition of
bonuses in salt. I think the draft needs to be carefully collated
with the laws of the People’s Commissariat for Justice
which are in force, and rewritten. I would advise that the
prohibition to issue bonuses in salt should be passed through
the C.L.D. as a separate decision right
away.[1] What
in my opinion is the main thing is not to be found in the
draft at all, namely, a number of immediate practical
measures for the stricter guarding of salt, in the hands of the
state, and for a maximum reduction of all manner of issues
of salt to industrial and office workers, urban residents and
all the population in general. This last measure must be
put through, at least for the current autumn and the early
winter, in the harshest proportions, as otherwise we shall
not get any grain from the peasants in exchange for salt.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In addition and amendment of the decree of May 31, 1921, on
the state monopoly for salt, the C.P.C. adopted a decision on
August 23, 1921, setting out practical measures to ensure the salt
monopoly and the balanced distribution of salt in the national
economy. The decision was published in Izvestia VTsIK No. 194,
September 2, 1921.

The All-Russia C.E.C. and C.L.D. decision prohibiting
bonuses in salt, and laying down penalties for breaches of the salt
monopoly, was approved on August 29, 1921, and published in
Izvestia VTsIK No. 194, September 2, 1921.

Comrade Popov:

I am afraid I cannot accept your resignation.

As you are, of course, aware, you are entitled to appeal
against my instructions, but your appeal does not suspend
the necessity of performance. Please let me have a short
list of what you are doing in accordance with my
instructions, specifying the dates (roughly, of course, from—to).

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.

P.S. Certainly, you can and must take sick leave to
recover. But in that case write separately to me or, if you
want to expedite matters, to Fotieva, and she will read
it out to me over the telephone (about the leave and a
“deputy”). There must be a formal appointment of a temporary
“deputy”.

P.P.S. Let me add that your letter is much too
polemical. I do not object to polemics, but it should be brought
out specially. You have been arguing against something
that I have never said or thought. Your argument implies
that I deny the usefulness of what has been done, etc. But
I have never said or thought so.

Please inform me of what you are undertaking in
accordance with the points of my letters of
June 4[1]

and August

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky

I draw your special attention to the question of Leslie
Urquhart’s concession (Kyshtym works and other numerous
copper mines).

Krasin and Bogdanov, together with you, must study the
terms of the concession and draft an agreement. It is of
exceptional importance for us to arrange things in such a
way that the concessionaire, who wants to take over nearly
all the copper mines in Russia, should, first, guarantee our
royalties and our early receipt of them, and, second, that
we should have the possibility of obtaining from the
concessionaire the necessary equipment to develop the
operation of our own mines. After you have studied the matter,
please inform me to what extent you believe the one and
the other condition are guaranteed, and what is in general
the importance of the proposed concession from the
standpoint of developing Russia’s supply and her electrification
in particular.

G. M.:

Please return this to me after
reading.[1] 

I may be partly to blame, having caused this bout of
hysterics by excessive strictness.
 

But I am essentially right and will continue to insist,
and have not accepted his resignation.

What do you think: perhaps we should pass all these
measures through the State Planning Commission and
specially confirm them in the C.L.D.?

(Read my letter to Popov of 4.VI. 1921: there is a list
of 8 points.)

Note in particular: analysis of food distribution, fuel,
its saving, etc.

A precise plan for the work of the Central Statistical
Board and the State Planning Commission.

What is your opinion?

Lenin

22/VIII.

P.S. Phone me when you have read this, We shall have
precisely to agree on all this. Circumstantially and
precisely.

Lenin

P.P.S. Don’t show Popov’s letter to anyone.

1. Is it possible to find and send me my preface to the
German edition of my book on
imperialism?[1]

I sent the
preface to Petrograd a year ago. It seems to have been lost
somewhere.

2. I am very anxious about whether our slogan of
collecting donations in aid of Russia only directly to our
address, i.e., not through the governments, has been brought
out quite clearly and prominently in the foreign

    

workers’ press in general, and in the communist press in
particular.

We signed an agreement with the American Secretary of
Commerce, Hoover, in Riga on Saturday (do not publish
anything about this yet; and Harding has been calling on
the American people to send in all donations through
Hoover.

It would be extremely important for the Comintern to
put forward a definite slogan, without coming out against
the American Government for the time being, saying that
the workers should send in their donations only directly
to the address of Soviet Russia’s representatives abroad.

For any donations sent through the bourgeois
governments necessarily carry for us, directly or indirectly, to a
greater or lesser extent, some sort of strings, whereas the
workers will undoubtedly agree to send their donations to
us without any strings, and this is a distinction of
tremendous importance for us.

Is it possible to check whether the Comintern and the
trade union press sympathising with us have accepted the
need to send in donations to the Soviet Government’s
address without any strings, and to start a broad campaign
to have all workers set aside a day’s earnings in aid of the
famine-stricken in Russia?

Very urgent

22.VIII.21.   

Comrade Smilga:

I think that one of the gross mistakes in the Donbas,
i.e., in all the effort to rehabilitate the Donbas, is that
there is no proper co-ordination of local work—industrial,
agricultural and commercial.
 

There seems to have been some friction, on the one hand,
between Pyatakov and Rukhimovich, and on the other,
between Pyatakov and the local trade unions.

I consider it extremely important for you not to confine
yourself to purely industrial matters, relating only to the
coal-mining industry, but to devote attention to the need
to eliminate the above-mentioned friction.

It is necessary, at all costs, to get the gubernia economic
conference of Donets Gubernia working intensively and
harmoniously.

Special measures should be taken to have Pyatakov and
all his apparatus direct their efforts to raise local
agriculture and carry on trade with the peasants, and with foreign
countries via Taganrog. In particular, attention should be
given to measures to boost local agriculture by introducing
irrigation through the use of the Donets River sluice-gates.
This plan, which promises to be highly practicable, has
been put forward at Gosplan.

In general, it is quite wrong for the coal-mining industry
administration to regard itself as being unconnected with
agriculture in Donets Gubernia.

I am sure that if the forces of the labour army, which
are available in Donets Gubernia, as well as the forces of
local miners and the coal-mining industry administration,
were to be thrown into the joint endeavour with the workers
of Donets Gubernia, it would be possible to secure not only
the earliest collection of the tax in kind, but also to
acquire undoubtedly large quantities of foodstuffs through a
correctly organised commodity exchange, both an
exchange of goods for salt, and of grain for coal.

I’ll be expecting you to send me, first, a telegram
containing a short notification that you have received this
letter and that you will do your utmost in this direction,
and, second, a detailed communication on the constitution
and work of the gubernia economic conference of Donets
Gubernia after your arrival.

Concerning the coal-cutting machines about which
Pyatakov wrote, I have a precise and detailed report from
specialists saying that even the coal-cutting machines already
available in the Donbas cannot be put to use for a
number of reasons, and that it is quite impractical to buy new

    

coal-cutting machines, because these machines will be
doomed to lie idle.

Please make a circumstantial study of this question with
the help of real specialists who have a thoroughly good
knowledge of the business.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Send this letter to the Gubernia Executive Committee at
Bakhmut, for C.L.D. representative Smilga who is due to
be at Bakhmut from August 27 to September 5, 1921. Send
it through the War Department with an especially fast
courier and obtain a personal signature for it. If Smilga
is not yet at Bakhmut, deliver it through the Gubernia
Executive Committee.

Phone Stalin to find out whether he will be sending a
letter to Rukhimovich. Let Stalin read a copy of this
letter, and if there is a letter to Rukhimovich from him, send
it along with this one not later than tomorrow.

Gosplan Presidium

I must have before Krasin’s departure the shortest

regards economic operations required to boost agriculture
in the famine-stricken gubernias.

Please order this outline for me to have it ready within
two or three days.

Please bear in mind that this should be confined to the
briefest information, a few lines about each of the
proposed works, with an estimate of their volume and cost.
 

Please let me know when I can have this report.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Comrade Molotov

I fully support the proposal made by Comrade Trotsky
relating to the trip to the border area by the persons  he
named.[1] I believe that a number of circumstances really
demand the adoption of the most vigorous measures in this
sphere, which are inconceivable without a trip of this kind.

Please record my vote “for”.

Lenin

On August 23, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central

to study the stale of its security and defence.

Concerning Zinoviev’s proposal to reprove Steklov for

not be done just now.
 

It seems to me that Solts’s item in Pravda on this matter

This document was written by Lenin in connection with the

the arrest of academic geologists working on the study of
sapropel (organic and inorganic depositions on the bed of reservoirs).
Yakovlev said their arrest had been unjustified and requested
their early release.

In a reply letter on August 25, I. S. Unschlicht wrote that
one geologist had been released, while the others could not be
released, because it had been established that they had connections
with the counter-revolutionary organisation in Petrograd.

Comrade Stalin:

Nansen’s most brazen proposal (to appoint a Cadet from
the Relief
Committee),[1] the behaviour of these “Kukishi”
and the enclosed telegram clearly reveal that we have made
a mistake, or if we did not make one earlier, we are
going to blunder badly unless we keep our eyes peeled.

You will recall that Rykov, shortly before he left, came
and told me that someone called Runov, one of our men,

    

had informed him about a meeting at which Prokopovich
had held forth against the government. The meeting had
been arranged by Prokopovich, who had used the Famine
Relief Committee as a screen.

What else is there to wait for now? Are we going to
tolerate their obvious preparations?

This is absolutely inconceivable.

I propose: this very day, Friday, 26/8, “Kukishi”
should be dissolved by a decision of the All-Russia C.E.C.
—motive: their refusal to work and their resolution.
Appoint one man from the All-Russia Cheka to take over the
money and to supervise the liquidation.

Prokopovich should be arrested this very day on a charge
of anti-government speech-making (at a meeting
attended by Runov) and detained for about three months, while
we make a thorough investigation of the meeting.

The other members of “Kukishi” should be expelled
from Moscow at once, this very day, and settled singly in
uyezd towns, preferably without railways, under
surveillance.

Really and truly it would be a bad mistake to wait any
longer. The whole thing will be done before Nansen leaves.
Nansen will be faced with a clear “ultimatum”. That will
be an end to this playing (with fire).

Not later than tomorrow we shall publish five lines of
a short dry “government communiqué”: dissolved because
of unwillingness to
work.[2]

We shall issue an order to the newspapers: the same day,
tomorrow, start ridiculing “Kukishi” in a hundred ways.
These whiteguards and sons of the landed gentry wanted
to take a trip abroad and refused to go and work in the
localities. Kalinin has gone, but the Cadets find it
“unbefitting”. They should be ridiculed and harassed in every
possible way at least once a week in the course of two
months.

The sore tooth will be extracted right away, and with
great benefit in every respect.

There must be no wavering. I suggest that we get this
thing over and done with at the Politbureau today.

Foreigners will start arriving, and Moscow should be
“cleared” of the “Kukishi”, and their playing (with fire)

    

should be stopped. Show this to the members of the
Politbureau.

26/8.

Lenin
 

Notes

About Fridtjof Nansen’s proposal see Notes 227 and 229.

The “Kukishi” were members of the All-Russia Famine Relief
Committee. “Kukish” is the Russian for fig, and is an acronym
coined from the names of Yelena Kuskova and N. M. Kishkin,
two of its members.

Dear Comrade Datta,

I have read your thesis. We should not discuss about
the social classes. I think we should abide by my thesis
on colonial question. Gather statistical facts about, Peasant
leagues if they exist in India.

Yours...

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written by Lenin in reply to the thesis on the national liberation
movement in India sent to him by the progressive Indian
political leader Bhupendra Nath Datta, who later wrote that Lenin’s
letter “came as a revelation to the writer. That the ‘peasant
movement’ is of importance for the movement for national freedom
has never struck a national-revolutionary. Sentimentalism is the
backbone of nationalism. The middle class considers itself to be
the representative of the nation and sees every movement in that
perspective. Hence, the instruction of Lenin not to discuss the
social classes but to get interested in peasant movement set the
writer athinking. It changed his Anschauung regarding the means
and methods of Indian fight for freedom” (Bhupendranath Datta,
Dialectics of Land-Economics of India, Calcutta, p. III).

In his letter to Datta, Lenin mentioned his theses on the
national and colonial questions for the Second Congress of the
Communist International (see present edition, Vol. 31, pp. 144–51).

Comrade Kiselyov or his Deputy


as Chairman of the Narrow C.P.C.

August 27, 1921   

Comrade Kiselyov:

A number of statements indicate that the introduction
of charges (for services, etc.) frequently creates an
intolerable situation for the workers.

There is need to elect a commission:

1) two from the All-Russia Central T.U.C.

2) one representative each from the Petrograd and the
Moscow Soviet of Deputies 
 

3) two members of the C.P.C.

4) Chairman of the Narrow Council (Comrade Kiselyov)
—to preside.

Assignment to the commission: 

all-round preparation of the question (and relevant
decrees) to the effect that the introduction of charges should
be made conformable to the workers’ wages and their
condition in general (exemptions for workers, etc., or something
of that kind, the dates and conditions on which charges
are to be introduced, etc.).

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

P.S. All these questions should be passed only through
the Full C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In contrast to the practice of providing free economic services
(transport, including urban transport, housing, posts,
newspapers, etc.), established during the War Communism period,
charges for rail and water transportation wore introduced on July
9, 1921, postal charges on July 18, prices on goods, including food,
on August 5, and charges for municipal services on August 25.


In the second half of 1921, the C.P.C. look a number of

   

measures to improve the workers’ material conditions: it introduced
new principles for wage payments in accordance with quantity
and quality of labour, payment in money instead of in kind,
guaranteed wages (in commodity rubles), etc. As a result, the real
earnings of workers had already increased by the end of 1921.

27.VIII.1921

In forwarding the resolution of the Presidium of the
Moscow Soviet of Deputies I request both the Chairman and
all the members of the Narrow C.P.C., especially Comrade
Goikhbarg, as a lawyer, to pay particular attention to the
need for more circumspect, thorough and considered drafting
of the text of decrees.

Corrections without end are intolerable.

I also have the impression that a number of recent
Narrow Council decrees show signs of haste.

The most serious measures have to be taken against this
disorder, so as to prevent even worse protests from the
population and the raising in the C.C. of the matter against
the Narrow Council.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

29.VIII.1921

I request that Gosplan Chairman Comrade
Krzhizhanovsky should be put under an obligation

to leave for Riga with Krasin, so as to spend one month

there in a sanatorium or a private home, receiving
treatment and taking a rest.

I strongly request that this should be done today, because
I am convinced, in my capacity as Chairman of the Council
of Labour and Defence, that the Gosplan Chairman is very
nearly worn out. It is necessary, urgently necessary, to have
him repaired.

Nothing can be done unless there is an Orgbureau
decision.[1]

Concerning the purging of the Party, I shall convey your
considerations to the Central Commission for Purging the
Party. My opinion is that the first serious experience in
purging the Party will give us a number of practical
indications which we shall subsequently use to draft the
conditions of enrolment. When you have collected enough
material, send me a letter with your considerations. Everything
that you have reported about the conditions of economic
work will be discussed by me in connection with all the
material available over here. Your recall from Siberia is
apparently to be put off until the work of purging the Party
is over.

Lenin
 

Notes

This document contains Lenin’s reply to a telegram from V. N.
Kayurov, who had been appointed chairman of the Commission
for Purging the Party in Siberia. The exchange of direct wire
telegrams took place on August 30, 1921, when Kayurov said
that he doubted the need for purging the Party, and proposed that
greater attention should be given to the Communists in
day-to-day practical work. At Lenin’s request, the Siberian commission
submitted its considerations on this matter to the Central
Commission for Purging the R.C.P.(B.).

A reference to the commission of representatives of the All-Russia

with the participation of representatives from the People’s
Commissariat for Food of the R.S.F.S.R. and the People’s
Commissariat for Food of the Ukraine, set up to inquire into the slate of
food supply work in the Ukraine. Objecting to the formation of
this commission, N. P. Bryukhanov wrote to Lenin: “It is not
likely that, the commission will propose any new measures. But
there is no doubt at all that it will divert some of the food
workers’ energy and attention from the fulfilment of their work, which
is urgent and brooks no delay” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Engineer Robert Eduardovich Klasson


Gidrotorf, 11 Sadovniki   

Copies: Smolyaninov, I. I. Radchenko,
Krasin, and Gosplan Presidium

I have received and read your report of August 31. If
the news you report that you have fully solved the problem
of the industrial dehydration of peat is quite true, this is
of tremendous importance. It is necessary at once to carry
out a check-up or a technical expertise and then to settle
the question of allocating to you the requested foodstuffs
and foreign currency. You must let us know how much
food and foreign currency you are requesting.

I am surprised at your communication that the powers
conferred upon you by the C.P.C. had been withdrawn
long ago, because no one could have done that.

Please arrange a conference with the participation of
Comrade Radchenko, a representative of the State Planning
Commission, Smolyaninov and
Krasin.[1] Since Krasin is
leaving on September 7, it is desirable to have things

    

finished before he goes. The assignment to the conference
is to take measures to verify your report and to determine
the amount of foodstuffs and foreign currency to be issued,
together with the terms of issue.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A commission consisting of representatives of the State Planning
Commission, the Central Peat Administration and the
Administration for Hydraulic Peat Extraction met on September 7, 1921, with
L. B. Krasin in the chair, to discuss the report about the new
way of extracting peat, and adopted a number of measures to
promote this work. Having acquainted himself with the
commission’s material on September 11, Lenin instructed N. P.
Gorbunov to establish regular supervision over the execution of
the decisions (see this volume, Document 378).

Comrade Adoratsky:

I have sent Lavrentyeva’s
application[1] to Smolyaninov
(who is acting for Gorbunov as the C.P.C. business manager)
for dispatch to the proper address.

I am not supposed in any sense to interfere in this and
similar other cases; and all the assistance you can give to
applicants should consist in “legal” aid to them, i.e.,
teaching them (and helping them) to fight for their rights
according to all the rules of the legitimate fight for rights
in the R.S.F.S.R.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

I find Kissin’s and Bryukhanov’s arguments correct. I
vote for them. You can’t raise the question in the C.C.
before introducing it in the C.P.C.

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is written on a note from the Managing Department of the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee to Lenin, putting to the vote the

   

question of authorising the Moscow Workers’ Co-operative to
procure potatoes directly from the peasants.

A. A. Kissin and N. P. Bryukhanov took a negative
attitude to this, believing, however, that the Moscow Co-operative
could have its agents and acceptance stations under the gubernia
societies. They held that, procurement in circumvention of
gubernia societies would tend to breed speculative commodity
exchange.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

This question has to be prepared for introduction in the
C.L.D. (who is Bogdanov’s deputy? Sapronov? This should
be agreed with him).

It is not clear whether only the best mills have been
brought out. Has the number of mills been properly reduced?

Or perhaps the “requirement” is earmarked for a heap
of sickly and hopeless mills?

This and other questions should be clarified with greater
precision.

Notes

This assignment arose from a letter sent in by B. P. Pozern,      

Chairman of the Central Textile Administration, concerning the    

organisation of work of textile mills. Pozern’s letter of         

September 17, in reply to an inquiry from the C.P.C. and          

C.L.D. Managing Department, said that supplies were earmarked     

only for the best organised textile mills. In September 1921,     

the S.E.C. Presidium allocated funds for the Central Textile     

Administration to buy food and fuel and carry out capital         

repairs at enterprises.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

There is need: (1) to find out whether the Georgian
comrades have abided by the condition (there has been one,
hasn’t there? a Party one?) not to sign any concessions
without our consent?

       (2) To study whether the terms of this
contract (in particular, who is the super-arbiter?) are in
substance advantageous. To do this, appoint 1 to 3 experts
through the C.C., and instruct them to submit an opinion
in writing.

Do the one and the other (through the C.C.).

Written in connection with the receipt of the text of a concession
agreement concluded by the government of Georgia for the
working of the timber resources in two areas of the Republic. On
September 30, the C.L.D. decided to accept the agreement. The

This Skobelev should be “cut down to size”. Noulens’s
appointment is a piece of impudence.

1/IX.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a telegram from J. A. Berzin addressed to G. V.
Chicherin, saying that M. I. Skobelev, who had started
negotiations with the French Government as a representative of the
All-Russia Famine Relief Committee, was requesting powers from
the Soviet Government as well.

Below is the reference to the appointment of Joseph Noulens,
one-time French Ambassador to Russia (1917–18), one of the
organisers of counter-revolutionary plots against the Soviet power
and of foreign armed intervention, to the Chairmanship of the
International Relief Commission. The commission (Britain, France,
Italy and Belgium) was set up by a decision of the Allied Supreme
Council and was in fact, a cover for implementing anti-Soviet
plans.

... If you have the time, you will find out (from the
statement.—Ed.) about the incredible conditions of the


||| NB

bureaucratic irresponsible confusion, and frequently of what looks like
deliberate resistance, in which we have to carry on the
building of the Volkhov hydroelectric power installation,

inaugurated by you through Comrade Smidovich three years ago.

... It pains me very much to waste your valuable time,
but I have decided to do so only because of my strong
conviction

|||
NB
that the Volkhov installation must be completed as soon
as possible at all costs.

Urgent

Comrade Gorbunov:

Will you undertake this business (or pass it to
Smolyaninov by agreement with him).

The statement and report by the chief engineer of the
Volkhov site, Comrade Graftio (of 25/8), expose both crime
(red tape) and a number of mistakes by the S.E.C. or the
Petrograd Soviet of Deputies, or the C.L.D., or all these
establishments together.

Therefore I suggest that you:

(1) at once instruct the People’s Commissariat for
Justice, on my behalf, to investigate the red tape and to bring
the guilty to trial. Introduce at the C.L.D. within a week.
 

(2) Call a conference (S.E.C. + Petrograd Soviet + State
Planning Commission inviting other departments concerned)
to work out, within a week, a draft C.L.D. decision on
measures to accelerate the works and arrange them
properly[1] (perhaps, on the model of the flax trust, giving Graftio
more powers?).

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

Inform me of execution.

Lenin

2/IX.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
By a decision on September 10, 1921, the C.L.D. qualified the
Volkhov project as a “top priority construction project”. All
departments were instructed to give top priority to indents from

   

the Volkhov project. The progress of construction was repeatedly
discussed by the All-Russia C.E.C. See also this volume,
Document 374; present edition, Vol. 35, Document 298; Collected
Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 53, Documents 288 and

Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars

... In fulfilling the duties assigned to the central
and local financial organs, they have recently been
coming up against exceptionally unfavourable
obstacles, chiefly the fact that the executive organs of
the Soviet power have

NB
|||

completely forgotten the
injunctions of the Constitution on the drawing up of
estimates and the making of expenditures in

accordance with them, which is having an extremely
harmful effect on the general state of the budget, and is
the cause of exceptional upheavals in the system of
monetary circulation.

To illustrate this, one need merely point out the
following circumstances:
1) in some districts, wages
are issued to workers not in accordance with the
tariff rates, but at free market prices, sometimes
amounting to as much as 700,000 rubles per man a day
(Privolzhsk district, and the western and eastern
gubernias);
2) actors and workers of Soviet theatres are
remunerated not according to tariff salaries, but with
additions, coming to many hundreds of per cent over
and above the latter (besides, under the estimates of
the People’s Commissariat for Education the cost of

    

maintenance of the theatres comes to

||||
outrageous!!

29,000 million,
and of institutions of higher education, to 17,000
million);
3) it has become commonplace, and very
much the rule for Soviet institutions and enterprises
to purchase the things they need on the free market
and, naturally, at its prices....

A proximate confirmation of the irregularity of
demands for bank-notes from treasure institutions is
provided by the practice,

||||
How did they
manage
to “adopt”
it without
the P.C.F.?

which has been adopted by
Soviet establishments even in Moscow, under which
the organs of the Moscow Soviet strive to have the
Moscow Finance Department hold for thorn bank-notes
to the amount of 3,000 million rabies a day, i.e.,
75,000 million a month, whereas, according to the
data of the budget department and the Central
Treasury of the People’s Commissariat for Finance, the
Moscow Finance Department has up to now been
granted credits of only 188,000 million rubles, i.e., an
average of not more than 27,000–30,000 million rubles
a month....

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please send the following paper on my behalf: People’s
Commissariat for Finance + People’s Commissariat for Workers’
and Peasants’ Inspection + Chairman of the Narrow C.P.C.

I authorise the People’s Commissars for Finance and
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (or their deputies) to call
a conference right away with the participation of the
Chairman of the Narrow C.P.C., and the C.P.C. Business
Manager Gorbunov to work out and put before the C.P.C.
within a week draft decisions to combat the afore-mentioned
breaches of the law. I draw the attention of the Workers’
and Peasants’ Inspection to this oversight.

How has it been possible to tolerate the outrageous
practices described in this paper? In particular, the
overrun spending by the People’s Commissariat for Education
on the theatres?

Lenin

Chairman, C.P.C.   

2/IX.

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please see to it that this is done within a specified
period. You may send Smolyaninov instead of yourself, if

    

you want to, or let the conference be a three-sided
affair.

Lenin 

2/1X.

Comrade Gorbunov:

I read in today’s papers that a megaphone amplifying
the telephone and carrying the voice to a crowd has been
tested (and has given fine results) in Kazan.

Check through Ostryakov. If this is true we must have
it installed in Moscow and Petrograd, and incidentally,
check up on all their work.

Let them give me a short written report:

1) calendar programme of their work;

2) ditto—a speaking telephone exchange for 2,000 versts
in Moscow.

When will it be ready?

3) Ditto—receivers. How many being made?

4) Ditto—megaphones.

Regards,

Lenin

I propose that you should carry out the directives of
Svidersky and Reske in the most precise manner. I have
information concerning a number of breaches by you of the
rules of the central authority in the sphere of the People’s
Commissariat for Food work. I warn you that I will hold

fail to organise correct and concerted work together with
Reske. Reply in a couple of words by telegram and give
details by letter.

N. M. Knipovich is not only a scientific force of the
first order, but unquestionably an honest man.

There must be check-ups from time to time to see how
things are going on at the Central Administration of the
Fishing Industry (Glavryba).

Send this letter on a letterhead (typed) to N. M.
Knipovich through his son Boris N. Knipovich (who lives here,

Agriculture):
 

N. M. Knipovich

Dear Nikolai Mikhailovich:

I thank you very much for your detailed letter of 6/VIII.
You are, of course, keeping an eye on Glavryba’s work.
I earnestly request you to send me from time to time your
remarks on the course of its work and any practical
proposals, if for any reason they should be “dragged out” at
Glavryba.

Sincerely yours,

The first thing to do is to print a short summary in the

approved for publication.

It is highly important for us to have exact and regular
information about the collection of donations by foreign
workers in aid of the starving in Russia. The Politbureau
yesterday adopted a
decision[1]

which has been sent to you.
I believe that responsible persons should be appointed for
each country, or group of countries, to follow the labour
press of various parties, taking down the exact figures, and
naturally, confining themselves only to:
1) the results of
the collection of donations;
2) exact indication of currency
in which the donations have been made;
3) indication of
date on which the donations have been collected; and
4) name of newspapers from which information has been
taken, and the party or organisation making the collection.

There is need to bring out under a separate head any
resolutions by parties and trade unions about one-day
wage contributions.

I should very much like to have a reply about what
exactly has been done by the Executive Committee and
when we could hope to have the first summarised results.

Lenin

Comrade Molotov:

One other thing should be done:

1) restrain Melnichansky and the Moscow Gubernia
T.U.C. by means of an extra strict reprimand (the trial of
Skvortsov-Stepanov and Litkens). This is the height of

    

impudence and shamelessness!! I insist on a reprimand with
publication on behalf of the
Politbureau[1];

2) revoke the All-Russia C.E.C. Presidium decision on
the issue of 1,000 million (milliard) for the theatres. It
is quite illegal to do this in circumvention of the People’s
Commissariat for Education]] This is outrageous. I demand
its revocation through the Politbureau.

Lenin

4/IX.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the legal proceedings for the recovery of royalties
started by V. V. Mayakovsky against I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov,
director of the State Publishers. On August 25, 1921, the Moscow
Disciplinary Court under the Moscow Gubernia T.U.C. ruled that
I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov was to be disqualified from union
membership for 6 months. On September 8, the case was
reviewed, and the judgement rescinded.

Deputy People’s Commissar for Education, Y. A. Litkens, and
member of the collegium of the Academy of Labour Education,
F. V. Lengnik, wore accused of dismissing a group of workers
arid employees. The Moscow gubernia comrades’ disciplinary
court under the Moscow Gubernia T.U C. issued a reprimand and
deprived them of the right to hold elective office for six months.
A commission of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee examined
this case on September 20 and decided: =

“1) To ask the gubernia
disciplinary court under the Moscow Gubernia T.U.C. to
reexamine the case =

2) On the substance of the accusation ... to
confine itself to a trade union and a Party reprimand” (Central Party

   

Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

Concerning Lenin’s proposal, set out in point 2 of the
document, the Politbureau of the C.C. drew the attention of the
Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C. on September 6, 1921, to the need
to refer the matter of appropriating 1,000 million rubles for the
theatres for the examination by the C.P.C.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

The question of commodity exchange is the most important
one. You are to give it top priority.

In particular:

1) find Prodovolstvennaya Gazeta No. 97 and include in
this file;

2) propose that the Central Union o/ Consumers’
Societies should amplify these data of Khinchuk’s and print
them;

3) send me what has been printed, stepping up the
printing;

4) insert an item in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn giving all
manner of encouragement to the collection and publication
of factual data on the commodity exchange (the quantities,
or the equivalents of some quantities).

Written in connection with a note from L. M. Khinchuk,
Chairman of the Central Union of Consumers’ Societies, about
improving commodity exchange in Orel, Bryansk and Gomel gubernias.

On June 17, 1921, No. 97 of Prodovolstvennaya Gazeta carried
an article entitled “Experience in State Commodity Exchange”.

Urgent

Comrade Molotov:

In view of the extreme importance of this question and
its (I hope) indisputable nature, I propose that this should
be circulated for reading by all members of the Politbureau,
and approved by phone (I consider my amendments
adopted, if they are not questioned either by the C.C. members
or the members of the commission: if they are questioned,
I suggest adoption without these amendments, so as not
to drag things out). Be sure to pass it also through the
All-Russia Central T.U.C. and to publish it on behalf of
the C.P.C., with this obligatory indication: approved by
both the All-Russia Central T.U.C. and the R.C.P.
Central Committee.

I am sending these theses to Oborin in Petrograd on
Monday, 5/IX, asking him to phone his opinion. It is
important to have the opinion (and I hope consent) of the
Petrograd trade union functionaries.




Comrade Molotov: A list of these 30 persons should
be obtained and kept at the C.C. archives together with
the date of this conference.

Lenin 

4/IX.

Send urgently to Molotov after Lepeshinskaya’s entry
of the amendments.

Lenin

4/IX.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on A. S. Kiselyov’s letter, saying that lie had sent
Lenin a draft of the “Basic Propositions on the Rating Question”
drawn up by members of the Narrow C.P.C. (A. S. Kiselyov,
A. A. Belov and Y. I. Gindin) and approved by a conference
of heads of the major production associations, attended by nearly
30 men. This draft was based on the directives of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee. Having acquainted himself with the draft
theses, Lenin made his corrections, emphasising the direct
connection between remuneration for labour and the results of
production (see Lenin Miscellany XXIII, pp. 258–60). After an
all-round discussion by the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee, the C.L.D.,
at a joint silting of the bureaus of Party groups of the All-Russia
Central T.U.C., the Moscow gubernia T.U.C. and the Party
group of the S.E.C. Presidium, the “Basic Propositions on the
Rating Question” were approved by the C.P.C. on September
16, and published in Izvestia VTsIK No. 207, on September 17,
1921. See also Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 53,

5/IX.

Comrade Solovyov:

Is it possible to bring out more detailed data on the
distribution of Communists by Soviet government office
(except the Red Army):

People’s Commissariat,


department,


subdepartment,


etc.


with more details about nature and type of work.

Let’s have this for Moscow, at least (the most important
thing is to separate Moscow from the uyezd, if possible;
Moscow is the main centre), and for Petrograd.

My impression is that the statistics of the R.C.P.
members deal with too many details, which are “common” to
any statistics, but are unimportant. The important thing
for us is to have details about the distribution by Soviet
government office.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Communists in Soviet government office would be sent to Lenin

5/IX.   

Comrade Alsky:

There must be a close watch on the spending of the gold
stock.

Perhaps you could do the following: 

have this table compiled.
In
hand

Of this allocated
( =issue allowed^)

Unallocated
stock in hand

Gold Stock
by 7.XI.1917
7.XI.1918
 ” ” 1919
7.XI.1920
1.I.1921
1.VII.1921
or 1.IX (7.IX).1921

In other words, the table should give a full picture of the
amount issued and the available stock (by a definite date).

Let us draw up the table in such a way that the
horizontal graphs should run on (current statistics) by months.
Let us have this mobile and regularly filled-in table be
kept over at your People’s Commissariat for Finance.

Send me a copy of it by 1.IX.1921, and then send in
weekly additions (current expenditure).

The total must include all gold without any exceptions.

Please write me when you can let me have it.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

£Perhaps here we shall have to add two or three
vertical graphs: amount already sent out of Russia, i.e., paid
out. Also perhaps: refused payment or reduced amount, etc.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A report on the gold stock and its expenditure was submitted to    

Lenin by the People’s Commissariat for Finance. On September       

14, 1921, the C.C. Politbureau instructed A. O. Alsky to see       

that all expenditures of the gold stock were strictly accounted    

for. See also this volume, Document 371; present edition, Vol.

“Maly Parizh” Room 5

Dear Comrade:

I thank you very much for news of Lalayants. I am very
sorry to hear that he is outside the ranks of the R.C.P.

Please write me if you can in greater detail about why
he is outside the Party, when he left it, how he lived
under Kolchak in Siberia, etc.

Since you think it worth while involving him in Soviet
government work, may I ask you to write me whether you
believe that we should find him work in Irkutsk or, perhaps,
it is possible and expedient to do so elsewhere, say,
Moscow.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

5/IX.

Comrade Chicherin:

I attach no importance to Berzin’s opinion about the
decline of the British labour
movement.[1] Berzin knows
little and is always “pessimistic”.

I am very much worried about the search of his luggage.
I think we should make a strict application of the “eye
for an eye” rule to British representatives. Pedantically:
treat them just as badly and a little worse. Is this being
done?

Then, concerning the
“Hooverites”,[2] their every step
should be watched (by the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs through the press and perhaps some “ties”);
while the worst of them (someone called Lowrie?) “tracked
down” and caught, so as to land them in a scandal.
 

This calls for relentless, persistent warfare.

Do all our representatives abroad know that everything
should he done to support workers’ collections (in aid of
the starving) directly to us? Send a dispatch (circular)
with this demand: their every report must state in code:
“workers’ collections in Britain (France, Sweden, etc.) for
fortnight so much.”

Collections only straight to our address.

We must have prompt, accurate and regular information
about this.

The “for Nansen” and “against Nansen”
campaign[3]
clearly shows (the extracts from the Daily Chronicle which
you have sent me are extremely interesting) that we must
reply to Noulens with a strictly sharp rejection: an
outright rejection. Then and only then shall we gain by
winning over the “pro-Nansen” elements and put an end to
the game of the anti-Nansenites.

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This opinion was expressed by J. A. Berzin in a note, which
he sent from Britain, apparently to G. V. Chicherin.





[2]
A reference to officials of the American Relief Administration (ARA)
which was headed by Herbert Hoover. Lenin’s proposal that
a number of restrictive measures should be taken in respect of
them was due to the fact that the staff of this organisation,
consisting mainly of U.S. army officers, engaged in espionage and
gave support to counter-revolutionary elements in Russia (see
this volume, Documents 310, 331 and 370).





[3]
Nansen’s activity in collecting donations from public
organisations and private persons to render aid to the starving in Russia
aroused dissatisfaction in the reactionary circles of some capitalist
countries. The Soviet people appreciated his efforts, and on
December 25, 1921, the Ninth All-Russia Congress of Soviets
carried a vote expressing deep gratitude, to him.

The Daily Chronicle, a newspaper of the British imperialist,
bourgeoisie, published in London from 1855 to 1930.

Comrade Alsky:

I asked you for data only from
August.[1]

Henceforth:

1) keep a special record of expenditures and issues from
the gold stock in a strictly chronological order (of course,
apart from the grouping by People’s Commissariats or
under specified heads, where such are required);

2) be sure to set apart the expenditure out of the gross
amount appropriated by a general decision (say, the
appropriations of 100 million for foodstuffs) from the
additional spending not provided for by any general decisions.

Unless you observe these rules you will not have a

    

report but chaos in which you yourself will be snarled up.
Before issuing any further instructions, I shall await your
reply which you are to give me tomorrow.

Comrade Nikolayev


People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs

I propose that you urgently appoint a commission of
three radio specialists to carry out the final trials of the
results achieved at the laboratory in Bogorodskoye Village,
of which you are
aware.[1]

It is desirable to have at least one responsible
Communist on the commission.

[1]
A reference to S. I. Botin’s experiment in the remote control
of powder explosions in 1920 and 1921. In October 1921, a

Comrade Zinoviev:

I have received the eight drafts of the People’s
Commissariat for Education which you have sent
me.[1] I
cannot agree with you that this should not be a matter of
urgency or that there is anything wrong in the drafts.
I am afraid that you have not taken enough care to read
them. There is nothing in the drafts about applying the
commercial principle to the schools. There is only a point
about attracting the local population, especially peasants,

    

to participation in the maintenance of schools. I believe
this to be absolutely correct, and certainly an urgent
necessity. Of course, amendments may be required on some
particulars, and these could be made during the discussion
of the draft, but I repeat that they are essentially quite
correct. Signs of anything like the commercial principle
can be found in the eighth draft only, namely, the right to
organise and lease enterprises to supply institutions of the
People’s Commissariat for Education. But even this draft,
and it is the one which you have failed to underline, I
consider to be absolutely correct, because without such
measures it is impossible to improve the maintenance of schools,
or to alleviate the starving of teachers. I absolutely fail
to see where you have spotted any relaxation of the
principle of retaining the schools in our hands. I have found
nothing to that effect in the points you have underscored,
nor in the eighth project, in particular. More and more
should be taken from the peasants for the maintenance of
local schools.

Lenin

Very urgent

S.E.C. Presidium, copies to the People’s Commissariat
for Finance and the People’s Commissariat for Workers’


and Peasants’ Inspection


and Engineer Graftio (home telephone 1–72–49.
22/3 Povarskaya St.)

According to Graftio’s report, the Volkhov construction
site is provided with foodstuffs for September-December,
but the work is at a standstill because of lack of
banknotes. The Public Works Committee is issuing only 125 
million for September, whereas, according to Graftio, the
requirement is more than 1,000 million.
 

I propose that the Volkhov construction site should be
immediately supplied with the necessary amount of
banknotes to ensure the accelerated conduct of operations in
accordance with the number of rations issued under the
All-Russia C.E.C. decisions of May 30 and November 5.


Send me your report of execution not later than
September 10.

(Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade N. P. Gorbunov:

Please reply to him as follows:

(1) we shall let him have the legal reply soon (the
formulation has to be given after verification by agreement
with Kursky, Chicherin, Goikhbarg, after very thorough
verification, with, perhaps, the help of Vladimirsky as well);

(2) for the atlas, all these republics are to be included:

One of the most important tasks of economic
construction, and undoubtedly the most pressing one just now, is
to reduce the number of establishments and enterprises on
state supply. Only a minimum of the largest, the best

    

equipped and organised enterprises, factories, plants and
mines should be left on state supply, with strict
verification of available resources. You are hereby ordered
immediately to carry out another check-up and to make another
reduction in the number of enterprises on state supply;
draw up right away a list of enterprises being left on state
supply, and send it on to the C.L.D. by October 1 of this
year.

Execution shall be the personal responsibility of all
members of economic councils, especially the Gubernia
Statistical Bureaus. I shall prosecute those who fail to
make sufficiently thorough reduction in the number of
enterprises.

§ 10 of the September 9 law on measures to improve the
supply of schools makes it binding on the People’s
Commissariat for Education to issue instructions.

There must be especial caution over § 6 (the end, the
right of
exchange).[1] This should be allowed not otherwise
than with full submission of accounts by a given date;
detailed rules; otherwise, imprisonment for stealing.

Co-ordinate with the People’s Commissariat for Justice

The same on § 8—fees for libraries and clubs.

There should be extreme caution; we can’t hamper
attendance. Show me before signing.

§ 6 of the decision dealt with the granting to schools of the right
to exchange articles of state supply they did not need for the
necessary foodstuffs. § 8 included the point about voluntary
“self-assessment” by those who used libraries and clubs.

13.IX.1921

Comrade Joffe:

You will find that today’s Politbureau decision (which
I enclose) largely meets your dispatch of
9/IX.[2]

Please be so kind as to send me a written report with
more details.

In addition, as a personal request, to enable me to sort
things out in this matter, I ask you to devote special
attention (in your report or in a special annex to your
report) to the question of protection of native interests
against “Russian” (Great-Russian or colonialist)
exaggerations.

What is the attitude of the natives to Safarov? Facts,
facts and more facts.

Who are the natives themselves (Safarov’s supporters)?
Names? Record? Prestige? (Facts, facts....)

Will they he able to stand up for themselves? Is that
sure? Even against such a subtle and firm and stubborn
man as Tomsky?

How many of them are there?

“The Union of the Poor” (set up by Safarov?)—its
composition? importance? strength? role? Is it true that the
natives were “forcibly” stratified?

Cotton? Its future? Is it true that Safarov is ruining
the cotton? Facts, facts.

The fronts in Ferghana? The Basmachi? Their attitude
to the Tomsky and the Safarov “line”? Facts and exact
decisions by Turkestan C.E.C. concerning the Basmachi?
The facts on what and when Tomsky and Safarov or their
supporters differed in this question? (Extracts from relevant
decisions, to show exactly when and on what precisely
the formal differences occurred.)

There are some differences on this question inside the C.C.

More exact information is highly important.

I personally very much suspect “Tomsky’s line” (perhaps
it would be more correct to say Peters’s line? or Pravdin’s
line? etc.) of engaging in Great-Russian chauvinism, or, to
put it more correctly, in deviating in that direction.
 

It is terribly important for all our
Weltpolitik[1]

to win
the confidence of the natives; to win it over again and
again; to prove that we are not imperialists, that we shall
not tolerate any deviation in that direction.

This is a world-wide question, and that is no
exaggeration.

There you must be especially strict.

It will have an effect on India and the East; it is no
joke, it calls for exceptional caution.

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
World policy.—Ed.
 



[2]
A telegram from A. A. Joffe dated September 9, 1921, said that
the differences between M. P. Tomsky, Chairman of the
Turkestan Commission of the All-Russia C.E.C., and G. I. Safarov,
a member of the Turkestan Bureau, tended to incite hostility
between the Russians and the local population, and between
individual nationalities. On September 13, the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee decided to discuss the question
of policy in Turkestan after receiving Joffe’s written report, and
after the Politbureau members had studied all the material.
Having discussed the work in Turkestan, on October 14, 1921, the
Politbureau appointed a new Turkestan Bureau and a Turkestan
Commission and outlined the principal tasks of Party and Soviet
government work in Turkestan. It emphasised the need for
circumspection in implementing the New Economic Policy in
Turkestan, which was to ensure the task of involving the toiling
masses in socialist construction.

In a letter of May 30, 1921, Lenin proposed that the

of the national economy its assistance was required above all
(see this volume, Document 182).

13.IX.1921

Comrade Semashko:

I have been receiving more and more indications about
the abominable state of our health resorts in the Crimea
and the Caucasus: bribe-taking, privileges for the bourgeois

    

and disgusting attitude to the workers, and, what is
important, total disorder in the treatment, and what is most
important, complete lack of supplies.

Please let me have exact information, whatever you have
on hand, at once.

And then let me know in greater detail about the modes
of checking up: how many health resorts (out of how many?)
submit correct reports (quantities of foodstuffs for the
number of patients? for the number of personnel, etc.?)—
the number of baths (mud baths), etc.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote a letter to N. A. Semashko in connection with the
report about the atrocious state of the Crimean health resorts,
which he bad received from Margarita Fofanova (who was on an
All-Russia C.E.C. commission sent to the Crimea by the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture). In a reply to Lenin on
September 15, Semashko set out the measures being taken by the People’s
Commissariat for Health to improve the work of health resorts
in the Crimea and the Caucasus.

13.IX.1921

I discovered yesterday that an urgent document which
I gave to Fotieva for L. B. Kamenev was dispatched the
“usual”, i.e. idiotic, way and was delayed for many hours,
and would have been held up for days but for my
interference.

It is intolerable for the office to work in this way, and
if I find another case of such typical red tape and spoiling
of business, I shall resort to strict punishment and
removal of personnel. These are my instructions:

1) on every document or package which I hand in for
dispatch, a personal check-up must be made by the
secretary on duty (who must leave a deputy, if she goes away,
and who must make arrangements with the telephone
operators on 24-hour duty, about a substitute);

2) check up to see whether all the inscriptions are there
(personal delivery; urgent; signature on envelope, etc.);

3) check up to see whether the parcel has gone to the
messenger at once;

4) be sure to check up by phone with the addressee;
 

5) show me the return envelope with the signature;

6) these rules shall also be carried out by the telephone
operators in the booth, in the event of assignments during
hours when the secretary is absent.

Comrade Osinsky, People’s Commissariat for Agriculture

Please urgently inform me about the arrangements for
the distribution of seeds in the famine-stricken gubernias,
stating:

1) The principles of distribution of seeds among the
population (whether they are issued to everyone or only to
those whose land has been prepared for sowing, whether
inspection of the ploughed-up area has been organised and
how, etc.).

2) Actual participation by organs of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture iii accepting delivery of the seed

    

freights, their storage, their transportation from the
railway stations to the localities, sorting of seeds, and, if
information is available, the pace of work in moving the
seeds from the central points of delivery to the localities.

3) Whether and how the inventory of the delivered seeds
has been organised (are there any lists, stating the names—
of persons or collectives—receiving the seeds, and the
quantities).

4) Whether and how control has been organised to verify
whether the seeds are actually used for sowing and not for
food.

The question of correct distribution of seeds is of
especial importance.

Meanwhile, judging by K. Myaskov’s item, entitled
“The Spring and Autumn Sowing Campaigns”, in Izvestia
VTsIK No. 202 and by other reports, not all is well in this
sphere.

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade Gorbunov:

It turns out that Kursky and Cherlyunchakevich have
gone, without officially handing over their business, namely,
the signing of the Narrow C.P.C. minutes. This is the height
of lawlessness. Order must, be restored at once: a) draw
up a protocol, b) telegraph demand for a reply from
Kursky and Cherlyunchakevich, and c) appoint and start a case
on breach of duty by Kursky and Cherlyunchakevich.

Comrade Rakovsky, Kharkov


Copy to Comrade Vladimirov

The People’s Commissariat for Food of the R.S.F.S.R.
has remitted to you bank-notes worth 20,000 million
rubles, of which 10 are for Kiev, and 10 for Kharkov for the
purchase of grain and cattle. We intend in the near future
to send to you, over and above the Ukrainian monetary
allocation, regular monetary remittances up to 50,000
million a month for the special designation of grain purchases.
The R.C.P. Central Committee proposes that you should:
1) firmly reserve these remitted amounts for the said
purpose under the personal responsibility of all organs of the
People’s Commissariat for Finance;
2) bind the food organs,
on the responsibility of the Ukrainian Commissariat for
Food and gubernia food supply commissars, to expend the
remitted resources exclusively for the purchase of grain
and cattle. The R.C.P. Central Committee proposes that
you should enter the R.S.F.S.R. Council of People’s

    

Commissars decree of August 23 in your register, with the
addition of the All-Russia C.E.C.’s on the salt monopoly.

Comrade Bryukhanov:

Today I signed a telegram concerning 1.2 million poods
of hay for Moscow.

I think it is wrong to have me sign all such telegrams.
We must go over—perhaps gradually, but go over we must
to have people (including gubernia executive committees)
carry out orders even without my signature—to have them
obey normally and not only in extraordinary cases.
 

Send out 2 or 3 telegrams by way of urgent order.
Followup. If they are not carried out—inflict double punishment
and chock up on the infliction.

Please let me know the precise plan (and calendar
programme) for switching local establishments to normal
discipline.

19.IX.1921

Comrade Kuibyshev:

I have just had a visit from


Rutgers,


Calvert


and Heywood 

representing the American workers’ colony group who
wish to take the Nadezhdinsk Works and several
enterprises in the Kuznetsk
basin.[1]
 

They want their representative (with an interpreter) to
attend the Council of Labour and Defence on Friday. I think
we should let them come.

I also draw your attention to and request you to inform
all members of the commission and subcommissions of the
following:

(1) The Nadezhdinsk Works, in their opinion, is both
economically and technically connected with a group of
enterprises in Kuzbas, for it will provide tractors for their
farms; tractors and all oilier farming implements for the
peasants; repair of machinery for their group’s enterprises
in Kuzbas; equipment for water transport communications
with Siberia, etc.

(2) In Kuznetsk basin they are taking 12,000 dessiatines
of land and several enterprises, wishing to set up a large
arid complete economic whole.

(3) They want only 300,000 dollars in cash. It would
be wrong to think otherwise.

(4) In addition, they want grain and clothing, in order
to start the necessary building operations at once. They
say work should be started this very winter to have time
to finish it by the spring of 1922.

(5) They stress that they will have a firm administrative
set-up for their workers’ group; and the whole group
(3,000–6,000 workers) selected from among the best workers,
mostly young and unmarried men, who have had practical
experience in their line, and have lived in a climate
similar to that of Russia (Canada and the Northern United
States).

(6) They want to be directly subordinate to the Council
of Labour and Defence. Something like an autonomous
state trust consisting of a workers’ association.

They say, by the way, that 200 American lumberjacks
arc living here in the “émigré house”. Most of them are
without work. They are itching to get to work. They say
that if you send about 30 of them to the Nadezhdinsk Works
and 15 to Kuznetsk basin at once—with full equipment
and food, they will start building log cabins immediately.
(The rest of the 200 will go there later.) They want us to
hurry up with sending them off.

They say that Gerbek (? I did not quite catch the English

    

pronunciation of the name) from the Urals Industrial
Bureau had agreed to their plan verbally, and the Siberians
(the Siberian Industrial Bureau), in writing.

They intend to take along 10–15 per cent of
Russian-speaking workers. They could take more.

Please take all this into account.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of Labour and Defence
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
During the second half of 1921, a group of American workers,
led by a Dutch Communist engineer, Sebald Rutgers, negotiated
with the Soviet Government on the lease of a part of the Kuznetsk

   

Coal Basin in Siberia and the establishment of an industrial
colony there. Rutgers’s proposal was examined by the C.P.C. on
September 13, 1921, and referred to the S.E.C.

On September 19, Lenin saw representatives of the American
workers’ colony and had a talk with (hem. There is a record of
this talk made by Lenin (see Lenin Miscellany XXIII, p. 39).

On September 23, 1921, the C.L.D. decided to recognise the
agreement with the Rutgers group as desirable and instructed
a special commission to draft its text. The agreement was finally
approved on October 21 by the C.L.D. and on October 25 by the
C.P.C. The colony operated in Kuzbas as an enterprise directly
subordinate to the C.L.D. See also this volume, Documents 416
and 436; present edition, Vol. 42, pp. 344–45, 348–49, 350;

and 374.

I have been informed that the lift will not work on

This is utterly scandalous. There are people with ailing
hearts for whom it is harmful and dangerous to walk up.
I have repeatedly ordered to have an eye kept on the lift
by appointing a responsible person.

I hereby issue you a strict reprimand, and order you to
find out who has been guilty of failure to give a timely
warning; let me have again a list of responsible persons
and the measures of punishment to be applied to them.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

20.IX.1921   

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please issue an order to have the following literature
collected:
 

1) everything in Russian on electrification over and above
the book, Plan of Electrification.

The reports by Krzhizhanovsky and Ramzin in
Petrograd.—Kushner’s pamphlet.—Other pamphlets on
electrification—the publication by the Vladimir Gubernia
Executive Committee on electrification and other local
publications.

2) The new literature (1915–1921) in German on the
state of electrification in various countries and its tasks,
etc. (through Krzhizhanovsky, etc.).

Get me all this within one or two weeks for a period of
two months for Iv. Iv. Skvortsov
(Stepanov).[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The literature mentioned by Lenin in the document was required
by I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov, who was working on the book
Elektrifikatsiya RSFSR v svyazi s perekhodnoi fazoi mirovogo
khozyaistva (Electrification of the R.S.F.S.R. in Connection with
the Transitional Phase of the World Economy), Gosizdat, 1922.
There is this entry on September 20, 1921, in the register of
Lenin’s C.P.C. and C.L.D. assignments: “Collect literature on
electrification for I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov. Fulfilled October 21”
(Istorichesky Arkhiv No. 5, 1961, p. 42).

Comrade Adoratsky:   

Could you help me find the following two things:

1) the article (or extract from the pamphlet? or letter?)
by Engels where he says, on the strength of the experience
of 1648 and 1789, that there is apparently a law demanding
that the revolution should advance beyond the point where
it can cope, to consolidate the less significant
transformations?

I recall that this was published in our Bolshevik
newspaper (Proletary?) abroad during the 1908–1912 epoch, but
my recollection is
hazy[1];

2) Engels’s letter to Weydemeyer of 12.IV.1853. I shall
be very grateful for any hints.

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the following passage in F. Engels’s article “On               

Historical Materialism” (English introduction to Socialism:               

Utopian and Scientific): “In order to secure even those conquests        

of the bourgeoisie that were ripe for gathering at the time, the               

revolution had to be carried farther—exactly as in 1793 in France            

and in 1848 in Germany. This seemed, in fact, to be one of the laws            

of evolution of bourgeois society.” Quoted from Lenin’s article               

“The Assessment of the Russian Revolution” published on May 10               

(23), 1908 in Proletary (see present edition, Vol. 15, p. 58, and also 

Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol. II, Moscow 1962, p. 105).       

For F. Engels’s letter to Weydemeyer see Marx and Engels.

C.C. Orgbureau

I have personally known Comrade Shapovalov for a long
time, in exile at the end of the 19th century, and in the
early 20th abroad. I hereby certify that he is a thoroughly
loyal and honest representative of the best men in the old
Party guard. I therefore consider it my duty to support
his request for a chance to go abroad to receive treatment
and work for the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.

Comrade Avanesov, Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection


About Red Tape in Supplying the Kashira Site

I am enclosing herewith three letters from the Kashira
site. The C.L.D. has been receiving almost daily complaints
from it about red tape and interruption in food supply.
Instead of doing their job, the Kashira builders have been
wasting a considerable part of their energy on getting the
food supply in. We must put a stop to this. Considering
the exceptional conditions created for the Kashira site,
this can well be done even with our stale of food supply
being what it is.

I propose that you should appoint a responsible man
with the urgent assignment to investigate the food supply
arrangements for the Kashira site, and find out who is to
blame for the red tape, charge the guilty with

    

responsibility, and, if necessary, work out a draft C.L.D. decision
regulating the supply arrangements for the Kashira
site.[1]

Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On October 26, 1921, the Council of Labour and Defence heard        

the question of food supply for the Kashira project and approved    

a draft decision introduced by V. A. Avanesov.

Comrade Ryazanov:

I very strongly support Comrade Adoratsky’s request,
who has done a great deal of useful
work.[1] It is important
to collect all the letters of Marx and Engels, and no one
will do this better than you.

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

V. V. Adoratsky, who, on Lenin’s assignment, was working on
a collection of selected letters of Marx and Engels, asked D. B.
Ryazanov, then in Germany, to collect all the published letters of
Marx and Engels and send them to Russia. The collection was
published in 1922 under the title Pisma. Teoria i politika v
perepiske Marksa i Engelsa (Letters. Theory and Politics in the
Correspondence of Marx and Engels). Translation, introductory
article and notes by V. V. Adoratsky.

I request that this should be done with special
thoroughness, so as to have everything ready in Berlin by 1.II.1922,
and delivered in Moscow without fail by 1.III.1922. The
reports should be brief, but regular, once a month. The
commission should be responsible for the technical
verification. Prizes will be awarded, if necessary. See that the
opportunity is not missed again, as it has been repeatedly in
this matter.

This letter is written at the bottom of “Instructions to the

Gidrotorf” in the text of which Lenin made a number of markings
(see Lenin Miscellany XXIII, p. 92).

R. E. Klasson’s report, addressed to Lenin on February 11,
1922, shows that these orders of the Administration for Hydraulic
Peat Extraction (Gidrotorf) were fulfilled in time.

Comrade Zinoviev

Copy: To Radek


  ”  To Rakosi


  ”  To Pravda secretary

24.IX.1921

Pravda has started to publish reports about the
collections by foreign workers in aid of the starving in
Russia.[1]
That is not the kind of reports we need. What you have
is a story. We have no paper for “stories” and no time to
read them. They are quite useless.

What we need is very short tables twice a month on the
following lines:

Germany — 10 million marks=about (    ) gold rubles

Austria — 10   ”  kronen—about (    ) gold rubles

Total——— about (    ) gold rubles


This will take 20 or 30 lines twice a month.
That is not much.

That is the only thing we need. A total in gold rubles.
I very strongly request you to do this and let me know.

With communist greetings,


V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The collection of funds among foreign workers in aid of the
starving in Russia was started after the “Appeal to the International
Proletariat”, which Lenin wrote on August 2, 1921 (see present
edition, Vol. 32, p. 502). In reply to this letter Mátyás Rakosi,
Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist
International, wrote Lenin on September 27, 1921, that his proposal
was “taken into consideration and would be implemented”
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Radek:

I thank you very much for the material you have sent
me. I return it. I cannot express my opinion, because I am
not clear on the matter: I cannot form an opinion after
reading the very little that you have marked off.

By the way, if you see Gennari, thank him for his
letter to the “Comrades members of the Executive Committee
of the Communist International” of 18/IX.1921.

It is clear, precise and fully convincing.

Serrati is a blend of petty-bourgeois spinelessness and
politicaster swindling.  I am quite prepared to repeat this in
the press if Gennari and other comrades—you and Zinoviev
among them, of course—consider it useful. In that case, let
Gennari send me the original of Serrati’s article in Avanti!,
and I shall write him a 20–line letter for the press. But it
is hardly worth while to do this.

Yours,

Lenin

To All Territorial, Gubernia and Uyezd Economic Councils,


Regional, Gubernia and Uyezd Party Committees,


Gubernia and Uyezd Executive Committees,


Gubernia and Railway Timber Committees


and to, All Railways Superintendents

The season for hauling the firewood from the woods is

    

nearing its end. Within two or three weeks, the autumn slush and
total lack of roads will halt the transportation of the
stockpiled fuel from the forests until the sleigh-roads can be
used. Meanwhile, the quantity of firewood available at the
railway lines at present and that to be brought out under the
plan of the Chief Timber Committee in the brief period of
transportation remaining fall very far short of the quantity
required for the normal operation of transport. There is a
threat of complete stoppage on the most important railway
lines.

To prevent a possible transport disaster, the C.L.D. hereby
orders that, beginning from October 1, a three-week fuel
transportation drive should be announced involving the
mobilisation for this period of all facilities and means for the haulage
of fuel to the railway lines, and attaching to this work the
same importance as to the collection of the tax in kind.

Call at once a meeting of the economic conference, with
the participation of railway representatives, to adopt all
measures to secure the maximum transportation of
firewood over and above the established targets, in an effort
to increase the transportation to double the set targets,
keeping the consumption of fodder strictly in accordance
with warrants simultaneously dispatched, in no case
allowing departures from these warrants. Notify the C.L.D.
at once about the measures taken.

Among the railways in the most disastrous state are the
Kazan, North-Western, South-Western, Kiev-Voronezh,
Nikolayevskaya, and the railways in Siberia. That is why, all
energy, resources and facilities must be strained to the
utmost in the gubernias through which these key railway
lines run, in order to achieve the maximum results.

Vigorous execution is hereby declared to be the personal
responsibility of chairmen of the gubernia executive
committees, chairmen of the gubernia timber committees, and
chairmen of the gubernia Cheka, in accordance with Soviet
and Party procedures.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman,

C.L.D.[1]

 

I propose that this should be co-ordinated by phone at
once, to give us time to get this also by phone through the
Politbureau and the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C.
tomorrow, 28.IX.

27/IX.

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
This is followed by the signatures of M. I. Kalinin, Chairman
of the All-Russia C.E.C., and V. M. Molotov, Secretary of the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C.—Ed.
 



[2]
The draft telegram was heavily edited by Lenin: he altered the
date of the start of the three-week fuel drive from September 25
to October 1; instead of “increase the transportation by 100 per
cent” he wrote: “increase the transportation to double the set
targets”; and wrote the final paragraph about the personal
responsibility.

Appended to the telegram is a list of a telephone poll on
September 27, 1921, on which the secretary marked off the votes of
I. T. Smilga, E. M. Sklyansky, N. B. Eismont, M. I.
Frumkin, A. A. Andreyev, L. B. Kamenev,  A. M. Anikst, V. M.
Molotov, J. V. Stalin, L. D. Trotsky, A. S. Yenukidze (for the
Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C.) and V. A. Avanesov.

The telegram was published in Izvestia VTslK No. 219, on
October 1, 1921. See also Lenin Miscellany XXIII, p. 101.

Comrade Zinoviev:

The three of us (Molotov, Stalin and I), in our capacity
as a commission appointed by the C.C., have discussed
your letter.

We still cannot agree with you.

In Moscow, there were major differences on principle,
there was the Workers’ Opposition, which the Party
Congress condemned for its “deviation”, one which was not

    

only on a Moscow but on an all-Russia scale, with a long
history behind it.

In Petrograd, there are no differences on principle, nor
is there even a deviation towards a deviation. There is
nothing of the sort about Komarov or Uglanov, who were
most reliable at the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. and at
the metalworkers’ congress as well. These comrades could
not have plunged into a deviation so suddenly. We find
not a trace of the facts to prove this.

There is a legitimate desire on the part of a majority
to be the majority and to substitute another group for the
one through which you have been “running things”. The
people have gained in stature and that alone makes their
desire legitimate.

They should not be pushed into a deviation by talk of
“differences on principle”. Ideological guidance should be
exercised carefully, fully allowing the new majority to be
a majority and to run things. We are sure that if you want
this you could very well do it, and help the “old group”
to move to another city and refresh themselves.

Lenin[1]

29.IX.1921

Comrade Gorbunov:

There is no doubt about the importance of the matter
set out in the enclosed documents.

I feel that our press—Belyakov’s articles in Izvestia,
Sosnovsky’s in Pravda, and a number of other articles and
reports—has fully clarified and proved that a number of

    

state farms of the Central Agricultural Administration have
been working on model lines. The outstanding work done
by Comrade Runov, who is at the head of this endeavour,
is also reported by Comrade Muralov, a competent man.
The successful development of a truly proletarian
agriculture is of tremendous importance in principle.

It is as, or perhaps even more, important in practical
terms.

That is why I ask you urgently to prepare this matter
for the Narrow C.P.C. today (bank-notes) and for the C.L.D.,
tomorrow (enter on the agenda, make all the necessary
inquiries by phone,
etc.).[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.

P.S. If nothing else can be done, let them have what
they ask (to the maximum amount) on loan for a year. These
people have deserved our confidence many times over.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The register of Lenin’s C.P.C. and C.L.D. assignments contains
the following entry dated September 29, 1921: “Urgently get
through the C.L.D. the draft decision on land improvement work
on state farms in Moscow Gubernia (L. S. Sosnovsky’s letter
to Vladimir Ilyich). Fulfilled September 30 (see C.L.D. Minutes
No. 254, § 9)” (Istorichesky Arkhiv No. 5, 1901, p. 43).

On a report by T. A. Runov, Chief of the Glavzemkhoz (see
Note 619), the C.L.D. decided on September 30, 1921, to
allocate the money arid food required for these land improvement
operations on state farms near Moscow; instructions were also issued
for the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture to allocate tractors
for ploughing up grubbed areas.

29.IX.1921   

Comrade Gorbunov:

This business of Kara-Bugaz must be clarified. If you
are too busy, you may put this off for a few days, but not
more.

Lacis insists in Pravda of 29.IX that it is a
“Gold
Mine”.[2] Take at the C.P.C. Secretariat my recent
correspondence[1]

with Professor Ipatiev (member of the S.E.C.
Collegium), a specialist and the head of our chemical industry.

His answer to me was: can’t be started at present.

Is it the Central Salt Administration that is making a
mistake or someone else?
 

Do you think that we should take a look at the
Administration’s data to see how solid they are, or do something
else?

Find out and let me know.

Lenin
 

Notes

[2]
The article by M. I. Lacis, Chairman of the Central Salt
Administration, entitled “A Gold Mine”, spoke of the
importance of Kara-Bugaz, which could yield Glauber’s salt as a
major export item. He estimated that it would take 1,500
million rubles in capital investment which would be speedily
recouped.

30.IX.1921   

Comrade Gorbunov:

I sent out (through Smolyaninov, I believe) a telegram
to all gubernia electrical
departments[1]

ordering them to
send with their delegates to the All-Russia Electrotechnical
Congress statistical data on all electric-power stations in
Russia.

Be sure to find a copy and while the Electrotechnical
Congress is in session carry out a stringent documentary
check-up on the execution of this.

We must have this done, because the matter is of
enormous economic and political importance.

If need be, circulate a questionnaire among the delegates
to the Congress, detaining all those who fail to fill it in.

Secure execution and information, and carry out a
strictly cavilling check-up!

30.IX.1921   

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please have this letter sent out in copies to 

1) Comrade Danishevsky (Chief Timber Committee)


and 2) Comrade Molotov, C.C. Secretary


3) Comrade Kiselyov, Chairman of the Narrow C.P.C.
 

The C.C. has decided to assign 15responsible men for
fuel (firewood, to be more precise) work for the three-week
period.[1]


I should very strongly request comrades undertaking this
extremely important work to devote especial attention to
the following circumstances:

1) Verification of how the accounting (of the stockpiling,
haulage and carriage to the stations) is arranged in the
localities.

This business is run badly. The C.L.D. is aware of this,
but does not know how to help. Comrades observing it
at the grass roots, on the spot, can do a great deal to help,
if they make a thorough study of the thing on the spot.

2) Stealing methods.

The stealing of firewood is very widespread (and this
is understandable in a cold ruined peasant country).
Bureaucrats and contractors very frequently cover up this
stealing and carry it through “artistically”.

It is extremely important to make a much more detailed
study from below of the methods of cheating (from entries
in the books, receipts, etc., etc.). The C.L.D. is badly
in need of this.

I earnestly request all 15 comrades who are going, to
read this and drop me a couple of lines; if the need arises,
to agree to remain on the spot for an extra week or so to
make a more thorough study of the
business.[2]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Chairman, C.L.D.

The register of C.P.C. and C.L.D. assignments has the following
entry about this document, tinted September 30: “See to the
fulfilment of Vladimir Ilyich’s assignment to 15 responsible
workers mobilised for the three-week fuel (firewood) drive: a) check
up on how the accounting has been arranged in the localities;
b) study methods of stealing. Fulfilled 29.XII.21. 8.X collect
their record. Fulfilled 11.X” (Istorichesky Arkhiv No. 5, 1961,
p. 43).

In their reports addressed to Lenin, the workers mobilised by
the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee communicated the results of
the three-week fuel drive, and also exposed the serious
shortcomings in the work of timbering organs and the methods of stealing,
and outlined measures to combat them (Central Party Archives
of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee). See also Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p. 327.

Forlitcom’s report shows that it has managed to do
virtually nothing as yet.

The main task that Forlitcom should set itself is to have
the special libraries in Moscow, Petrograd and the major
cities of the Republic concentrate in their hands one copy
each of all the latest technical and scientific (chemistry,
physics, electrical engineering, medicine, statistics,
economics, etc.) magazines and books for 1914–1921 published
abroad, and to have regular receipt of all periodicals
arranged. I shall appraise the whole of Forlitcom’s work
primarily from the standpoint of the actual fulfilment of
this assignment.

By the way:

a) the report says that Forlitcom has decided to transfer
all credits from all the departments to Forlitcom’s account.
Has this decision been carried out? How much credit has
been received from each department?

b) Page 3 of the report says: “The boxes with scientific
and technical literature tended to contain a mass of what

    

was absolutely not important or remarkable in any way—
fiction and expensive de luxe editions, purchased no one
knows whom for (for private persons) as a personal favour.”
This is an incredible outrage and a crime. What has
Forlitcom done to punish the guilty persons? Let me know
at once the names of the guilty persons and how they have
been punished.

was being carried out in line with Lenin’s instructions (Central

Comrade Krasikov, Deputy People’s Commissar for Justice

On September 3, I sent to Comrade Kursky, his deputy
and all members of the Collegium my letter
No. 809,[1]

in which I set them the binding assignment to stage the
trial in Moscow of four or six cases of Moscow red tape,
this autumn and in the winter of 1921–22, selecting the
most “striking” cases and turning, each trial into a
political affair.

I enclose here a report from the chairman of a
Centrosoyuz special commission for aid to the starving, Comrade
Khinchuk, in which he says that the Centrosoyuz
assignment to deal with the procurement of seeds was frustrated
only because of red tape in the central establishments.
This is a sufficiently “striking” case. I propose that you
appoint an inquiry. Inform me weekly in writing through
Comrade Gorbunov about the results of the inquiry.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

P. S. Please arrange beforehand with Comrade Gorbunov
about the composition of the commission (or person) to be

    

appointed (rather whom you intend to appoint) to carry
out the
inquiry.[2]

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please have this letter sent to Comrade Kuibyshev
(member of the S.E.C. Presidium) and arrange with him and
let him have our stenographer to enable him to dictate to
her by phone.

Comrade Kuibyshev:

You saw at the C.L.D.
yesterday[1] how Rutgers was
levelling charges against us and you specifically. This is
a very important matter. It will undoubtedly be publicised
internationally. That is why special care should be taken
to keep a record of the case, to prevent any gossip and
distortions in the future.

I very earnestly request you to write down or dictate
to our stenographer (this will save some of your time) all
the developments in this matter, especially what you told
me on the phone about Rutgers’s incredible behaviour, his
rapid change of terms, etc.

Of course, we shall not show this to anyone, for the time
being, but there is need to make provision immediately,
just in case.

The matter has also been raised in the C.C. We shall
have to give exact and full information both to the C.C.
and the Red International of Trade Unions. Comrade
Gorbunov will make the arrangements for you with the
telephone operator, etc.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

1) to put through at the electrotechnical congress
(directly or through an authoritative commission) the
amendments and addenda to the “Electrification Plan” for its
final approval;

2) calendar programme for working out plans (primarily
the basic ones) for the current year by the State Planning

refusing to have any plans and for its being unable to draw

The wail about the lack of money is general and
universal. We could very well blow up. In all the localities
there is a feverish (they say) effort to sell everything, and
every imaginable thing is being offered for sale. Everyone
everywhere is howling. I don’t know what else can be
done and how. Perhaps you will personally go to see the
Preobrazhensky
Commission[1] or have a talk with him?

Here is a small example: In October, Rukhimovich will
supply up to 5 million poods of coal from the small
lease-holders in the Donbas. How are we to pay them? Where is
the money to come from?

We are late. The commercial tide is stronger than we
are. The Finance Commission and all of us are behindhand.
I have just sent over to Comrade Preobrazhensky your
note about the bills.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Preobrazhensky Commission, a Finance Commission of the     

R.C.P.(B.) C.C. and the C.P.C., was set up on Lenin’s proposal          

soon after the Tenth Party Congress to work eat aspects of financial    

policy in connection with the switch to the New Economic                

Policy.

Comrade Molotov:

The question of cancelling the C.P.C. decision of 6/IX,
increasing the tax on potatoes, must be introduced in
the Politbureau tomorrow (with Frumkin
summoned).[2]

Lenin . 

What did you agree with Stalin about
Petrograd?[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
See Document 408 of this volume.—Ed.
 



[2]
The Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C., having discussed the
matter on October 3, adopted the following decision: “To
instruct Comrade Frumkin to draw up a draft resolution of the
communist group of the All-Russia C.E.C. session.... To have the
resolution stress the need of correcting the excessive burden laid
on the peasants which was necessitated by the need to aid the
starving, and also indicate measures for its correction” (Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).


The Fourth Session of the All-Russia C.E.C., having examined
the circumstances which, had forced the C.P.C. to increase the
rate of substitution of potatoes for rye, decided that such an
increase could only be allowed as an emergency measure and only
in view of exceptional circumstances (famine), and expressed
confidence that the rural population would accept the new rate
of substitution as a duty to the starving (see Izvestia VTsIK
No. 224, October 7, 1921).

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please inform Comrade Radchenko that I am very much
afraid of any mistakes in this matter: how can I sign any
technical conclusions? This should be sent to the departments
for their endorsement and speeded up in passage through
the Narrow C.P.C. or through the C.L.D. I can help in
speeding this up in every
way.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

I. I. Radchenko asked Lenin to sign the minutes of the Council
of the Administration for Hydraulic Peat Extraction (Gidrotof)
which, on September 29, 1921, decided to postpone the date of
the Gidrotorf orders for caterpillar cranes from March 1 to May 1.
1922.

The register of C.P.C. and C.L.D. assignments contains an entry
dated October 3, which says: “Find out: =

1) whether Vladimir
Ilyich has the juridical right to sign personally, without the C.P.C.
and C.L.D.; =

2) whether Vladimir Ilyich has to endorse the
Gidrotorf Council minutes of September 29, as I. I. Radchenko requests.
Fulfilled October 3” (Istorichesky Arkhiv No. 5, 1961, p. 43).

Over the last month, you have stopped sending in any
information on the progress of the sowing campaign and
the combating of famine. The People’s Commissariat for
Agriculture, at present engaged mainly in the work of
overcoming the aftereffects of the crop failure, is more
than in the past few months in need of regular and the
fullest possible information about your activity and the
actual state of agriculture in the gubernia. Accordingly,
I categorically reaffirm earlier instructions on dates of
information reports, and propose that you should raise the
information apparatus up to the mark and, by way of
urgent order, within 48 hours from the receipt of this
telegram, telegraph the following information:
1) the approved
area under winter crops;
2) the area under winter crops
sown;
3) the number of dessiatines left for winter fallowing;
4) the quantity of seeds received under warrants from the
centre and through commodity exchange;
5) the quantity of
seeds actually distributed;
6) the distribution procedures;
7) measures taken to save livestock, results achieved;
8)
measures taken to save dead stock, results achieved;
9) planned
social activity, its implementation;
10) state of
resettlement;
11) state of village committees, their participation
in overall work. After telegram send special messenger
with full report. The responsible leaders of gubernias
failing to reply within the specified period will be subjected
to disciplinary punishment.

Comrade Kiselyov, Chairman of the Narrow C.P.C.

I wrote you concerning A. P. Smirnov’s
memo[1]

that I
resolutely object to any waste of potatoes on making
alcohol, and said that alcohol could and should be made of
peat.

It now turns out that the problem of distilling alcohol
from peat has not yet been finally solved. The method has
not been verified on an industrial scale and is economically
unclear (there is no precisely verified calculation and
no data to draw it up precisely). That is why it is still too
early to speak of the mass production of alcohol from peat.

Take all measures to accelerate in every way the
starting of the experimental plant to make alcohol from peat—
the former Givartovsky yeast plant in Moscow.

I strongly object to Smirnov’s proposal that we should
pay the peasants in alcohol for their potatoes. If Smirnov
insists, let him take the matter to the C.C.

October 4 he informed Lenin by phone that he bad been unable        

to secure equipment for the party over a period of three months.    

The next day, October 5, the matter was settled. The party was      

fully equipped within a few days and left for the Northern

Notes

This was written in connection with a complaint from the Kashira
project about the slow removal of the railway telegraph line from
one side of the bridge to the other, across the Oka River, close to
Kashira, to make way for the brackets supporting the
transmission line between Moscow and Kashira.

That same day, V. V. Fomin, Deputy People’s Commissar
for Railways, telegraphed an order to the Ryazan-Urals
Railway Administration to have the switch carried out immediately.

Dear Comrades:

You must have heard by now about the great disaster,
the unprecedented famine which has hit the whole of the
Volga area and a part of the area west of the Urals. The
drought has almost entirely scorched the cereals and the
grasses everywhere from Astrakhan Gubernia and all the way
up to the Tatar Republic and Perm Gubernia. Millions of
people—toiling peasants and workers—and millions of head
of cattle are already dying or are about to die.

Russian and Moslem, nomad and settler—all are equally
faced with cruel death unless help comes from their
comrades—workers, toiling peasants, shepherds and fishermen
from the more prosperous localities. Of course, the Soviet
power, for its part, hastens to help the starving. It has
already urgently sent them more than 12 million poods of
grain for winter sowing, and is now sending them food,
organising eating places, etc. But all of this is not enough.
The disaster is so great, and the Soviet Republic has been
so ruined by the tsarist war and the whiteguards, that

    

hardly a quarter of the needy can somehow be fed from
state resources until the next harvest.

Nor can we expect help from the wealthy capitalists.
It is true that the capitalists who now govern the strongest
states in the world—like Britain, America and France—
have told us that they allegedly want to help our starving
peasants, but on terms which are tantamount to handing
over to them all power over our Workers’ and Peasants’
Republic. We can well understand this. Has a bloodsucker,
a capitalist and a usurer, ever helped a toiler without
expecting something in return? The capitalist class has always
used the toiling man’s hunger to enslave him, body and
soul. They now want to make use of our famine to destroy
the freedom we have won at the price of our blood, to wrest
power from the workers and peasants for ever, and to saddle
them once again with the tsar, the landowner, the master,
the police officer and the official.

The only hope of the starving in Kazan, Ufa, Samara
and Astrakhan lies in the great proletarian solidarity
(sympathy) of toiling men, like themselves, with toil-hardened
hands, earning their daily bread by their own hard work,
and not sucking anyone’s blood. You have a good catch of
fish on the Aral Sea, and you will be able to live without
great need. So please set aside part of your catch for the
old men and women bloated by starvation, for the 8 
million exhausted toilers, who, after all, will have to do all
the heavy work in tilling the land on an empty stomach
for almost a whole year, and finally, for the 7 million
children who may be the first to die.

Dear comrades, fishermen and workers of the Aral Sea,
I urge you to give with a generous hand! In so doing you
will not only be acting in human conscience, but will be
strengthening the cause of the working-class revolution.
For you will demonstrate to the whole world, and to all
the working people above all, the invincible strength of
the Soviet workers’ state, built on the broadest mutual
assistance between proletarians in areas most remote from
each other.

Let the whole working class rise as a man to heal this
deep wound of the Volga area, and the fertile Volga area
will repay us with its grain in future years, That is the

    

only way for us to preserve the Soviet power and safeguard
the freedom we have won against all the villainous attempts
of the capitalists of the world.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade Krasikov:

Yesterday, the Orgbureau suspended the case (Moscow
disciplinary court) and referred it to the People’s
Commissariat for Justice.

Now you must let me have your opinion on Monday.

I advise:

(α) a brief report in the press (whom can we ask to do
it?) beginning with the case of Mayakovsky versus
Skvortsov[1]

;



(β) the law must without fail be specified or amended
in a legislative procedure. Memo about this on Monday.

Could this he done together with the All-Russia
Central T.U.C.?

Awaiting your
reply,[2]

[1]
A letter from A. I. Potyaev of September 21, 1921, reported
a sharp increase in the fish catch as a result of new forms of wage

   

payments to fishermen. He wrote: “Every fisherman delivers
the fish to us at 1913 prices (in gold currency) with sonic
adjustments (according to the market) and receives a special order which
he realises in our store or shop... We have established a
piece-rate scheme for the workers engaged in fishing.... Strict commercial
accounting has been introduced both for the goods in the stores
and the shops and for fish products.... It is my deep conviction
that we shall manage to overcome difficulties and achieve a
maximum of productivity only by giving the fisherman, the
worker, the employee, direct material incentives in the results of
his labour” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

October 10, 1921

Under the influence of the food supply situation in the
Donbas, which was aggravated last May-July, tens of
thousands of workers have abandoned the pits and have

    

dispersed, some of them beyond the boundaries of the area.
The flight is especially strong among coal-hewers, whose
numbers dropped from 16,000 to 10,000 in August, and also
among skilled boiler-men. The food supply situation in
the Donbas has now been stabilised, namely, a three months’
supply of grain has been delivered and is to be increased.
I propose that you start extensive agitation for a return
to the pits of the underground workers who have left
Donbas, namely, coal-hewers, sledders, timberers, drillers,
drifters, haulers, and also boiler-men and machinists. No need
to send workers others than those in the stated categories.
In conducting agitation explain:
1) full provision of grain;
2) introduction of new rules of payment in food and cash
by productivity, and abolition of levelling issues of food
and money; 3) on the return of the workers largely depends
the success of the food campaign in the Ukraine, which
had been slowed down by a shortage of fuel for food
transportation.

Lenin

Chairman,
C.L.D.[1]

C.P.C. Chairman, Byelorussia


Copy to Economic Conference

Teumin’s
report[1] at the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade does not answer the C.L.D. inquiry because
it fails to give any figures. The Economic Conference of
Byelorussia has been sending formalistic or unsatisfactory
replies to the C.P.C. business manager’s telegrams 01090
of September 8; 01134 of September 14; 01161 of
September 19; 01204 of October 1 and 01220 of October 5. Please

    

at once demand and obtain these telegrams from the
economic conference, investigate the matter, and prosecute
those guilty of red tape and sabotage. The required report,
signed by the economic conference chairman, must be
dispatched at once. Telegraph receipt of this telegram and
execution.

October 10

Received after Politbureau sitting.


Please circulate urgently to all members


of Politbureau for a written vote

10.X.   

Comrade Molotov:

I have an arrangement with Comrade Unschlicht to
delay execution of the sentence on Nazvanov, and am taking
the question to the Politbureau.

In the summer of 1921, I had a letter about Nazvanov
from Krasin (before Nazvanov’s arrest). Krasin requested
that this very valuable engineer, as he put it, should be
recruited for our work.

Krzhizhanovsky told me that ho, being acquainted with
Nazvanov, had repeatedly had sharp arguments with him
after 25.X. 1917, and had very nearly thrown him out of the
house for his anti-Soviet views. He said, however, that in the
spring or summer of 1921 he had noticed a change in
Nazvanov, and had taken him to work at the Stale Planning
Commission.

After this I had two comrades from the C.C. of the
sugar industry workers who, in reply to my question, gave
a positive opinion of Nazvanov, an opinion which they

    

confirmed in writing as well. On the strength of the
aforementioned, I am taking the matter to the Politbureau.

I propose: if necessary, Krasin’s letter and a written
reference of the two workers should be found. I shall find
both these documents if the Politbureau so decides.

For my part I propose: to cancel the Petrograd
Gubernia Cheka’s sentence and apply the sentence proposed by
Agranov (it is here in the record of the case), i.e., two
years with the possibility of conditional
release.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
M. K. Nazvanov, a technological engineer, a specialist in the
sugar industry, and the State Planning Commission’s consultant,
was arrested by the Petrograd Gubernia Cheka, together with a
group of professors and engineers, on charges of having
connections with V. N. Tagantsev, head of a counter-revolutionary
combat organisation in Petrograd. Nazvanov was sentenced to
be shot.

Lenin must have learned about the case from a letter sent in by
Nazvanov’s father on June 26, 1921, requesting clemency for
his son (Central Party Archives). Another request for Nazvanov’s
release came from G. M. Krzhizhanovsky in his letter of
September 18.

Members of the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee who took a vote on October 10 came out for Lenin’s proposal.
On October 14, the Politbureau confirmed its decision of October
10 to have the decision of the Petrograd Gubernia Cheka reversed.
On December 17, after the investigation of the Tagantsev case
was completed, Nazvanov was released. On January 26, 1922,
Lenin phoned an assignment to his secretary to ask V. A.
Smolyaninov to check up whether Nazvanov had been given a job at
the State Planning Commission, and to require it to submit a
report within two months about Nazvanov’s work and to remind
him about this.

I consider the matter of exceptional importance and
urgency, because to conclude a loan with Italy, which is not
demanding recognition of the old debts, might mean a
break through the financial blockade.

I propose a secret commission from the Politbureau right
away with a short term (2-4 days). Let us say, with the
following on it: Litvinov, Scheinman, Radchenko,
Krestinsky (with the right of his substitution by another
member of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for
Finance), and Bogdanov (with the same right).

The guarantee may be: timber (concession in the north);
oil on the Ukhta; oil on the Emba; copper mines, etc.

11/X.

Lenin

(Commission’s assign merit (2-4 days):


the Italian proposal specifically

and then general basis of guarantees.)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with M. M. Litvinov’s letter of
October 10, 1921, which said: “Comrade Vorovsky several times
telegraphed and wrote to us about the Italian banks being prepared
to grant us a loan with the knowledge of the Italian Government.”
On the letter are Lenin’s markings (Central Party Archives of
the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

This is urgent! I propose that either we vote right away
in writing or convene the Politbureau for half an hour.

I propose: agree to Marchlewski and Paikes (let
Chicherin decide who is going to Dairen and who to Chita).

Yaroslavsky won’t do for the conference in Washington.
Meshcheryakov—not too suitable. I propose: authorise the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the
Orgbureau to look for more candidates (24 hours).

11/X.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter to the Politbureau of the

   

R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee of October 10, 1921, requesting
the earliest possible appointment of a delegate for negotiations
with China over the Chinese Eastern Railway, and expressing
apprehension that delay in appointing the delegate could give
the forthcoming Washington Conference a pretext to
internationalise the railway. The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs
proposed that Julian Marchlewski should be the delegate.
Chicherin also said that Japan had agreed to have an R.S.F.S.R.
representative take part in discussing various matters at a conference
of the Far-Eastern Republic and Japan in Dairen (it was held
from August 26, 1921 to April 16, 1922), and proposed that
A. K. Paikes should be sent to the conference. Chicherin proposed
that Y. M. Yaroslavsky and N. L. Meshcheryakov should be
sent to the Washington Conference as representatives of the
Far-Eastern Republic.

The same day, the Politbureau adopted Lenin’s proposal.

On October 13, 1921, the Politbureau confirmed A. A. Yazykov
as the representative of the Far-Eastern Republic at the
Washington Conference.

11/X.

Comrade Rukhimovich:

I have read your report and am cursing you most
severely.

The report is done carelessly. Why not take 2 or 3 hours
here in Moscow (if you had no time in the Donbas) to put
it into good shape?

It is unfinished and unclear.

The required table is not there, but the report itself is
cluttered up with figures.

There is need for a short table: the price in terms of
flour or in gold rubles, etc.

1,000 poods of coal net at the pit head or at the station,
etc.

Before the war...——–

Now at the Central Board of the Coal Industry—————


(big pits).
 

There again, on the condition you mentioned (complete
success of the whole programme of collective
supply?)————

At small pits of leaseholders———–

The whole point is to have such a table!

Yet that is the one you have failed to give.

All your tables should he in a special little chapter,
giving the details and precise proof of the main and basic
table.

Furthermore, there is no clear statement: the
authorities (name, record, rank?) say the small pits are harmful.

So-and-so (names, etc.) are against this.

This is important, but it has been glossed over.

Thirdly, the conclusion? You should take what is
controversial.

The leasing of small pits?

This is now beyond doubt.

In your report this is slurred, over and it is not clear
what now remains controversial.


Apparently, 

it is that:

1) whether or not there is need right away for repairs
on a number (such-and-such? names) of big pits, and their
stoppage for repairs with transfer of their targets to the
small pits?

2) The leasing of medium pits as well?

3)—–precisely through the Donets Economic
Conference?

There is no clear statement about this. I or any other
person reading the report has to complete it in your
stead.

That is the way to ruin even a good case!

To clear things up we would need your plan: close down
for repairs so and so. Within two years (or how many?)
to have small pits yield 900 million, etc.

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes

Lenin gave much energy and attention to the rehabilitation of                

the coal and the iron and steel industry in the Donets Basin,                

which he said was “the main centre of our large-scale industry”    

and a Soviet bastion (see present edition, Vol. 33, p. 157 and

Comrade Rukhimovich:

Stalin tells me that you have taken strong offence at
my
letter.[1]


You are quite wrong to take this attitude, I had not
the slightest intention of being offensive.

I had to swear because I took your ideas in earnest. I
personally made a call yesterday about it to Ramzin (a
first-class, arid most honest scientist) and Smilga. Smilga
promised me to call a commission: Bazhanov + Ramzin +
yourself.

You must know how to fight instead of taking too modest
an attitude as you are doing.

I have not shown anyone my letter to you.

Make the best preparation you can for the commission;
and if you are voted down, let me have your “minority
opinion” precisely and clearly
stated.[2]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

12.X.1921   

Comrade Kuibyshev:

Please let me have the following additional explanations
on the Rutgers case:

1) everyone seems to think we shall have to spend 300,000
dollars.

But § 4 a) says:
 

“The Soviet Government shall allocate 100 dollars
for each worker coming to settle”,
while § 5 a) and b) say that 2,800+3,000=5,800 are
due to settle.

Doesn’t that make our expenditure 600,000 dollars?


Or should we add clearly: 100 dollars each for 3,000 men
for the Nadezhdinsk Works and nothing more?

2) Why is there no written statement from all three,
Rutgers, Heywood and Calvert, that they are willing to
sign the enclosed “undertaking”?

Please order this today and be sure to have it done in
English.

3) End of § 8 (our pledge to repay expenses) should be
set out more precisely in a special §: “The Soviet
Government undertakes to reimburse expenses only on the
following principles and in the following cases.”

4) Is there any sign of an ultimatum in the amendments
made by Rutgers and the others to the text adopted by the
Supreme Economic Council Presidium?

Please send me your reply (+the English pledge) and
return this letter to Molotov, C.C. Secretary, tomorrow,
Thursday, October 13.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

To All Gubernia, District, Regional and Railway Timber
Committees, to All Gubernia Cheka
(Copies to the All-Russia Cheka and
to Comrade Avanesov, Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection)

Despite constant reminders from the Central
Administration of the Timber Industry, the timber committees
continue to delay their progress reports, or are submitting

    

them incomplete or drawn up in the wrong form. It is high,
time that everyone should understand that the absence of
precise information on the replenishment of the firewood
and material stock greatly hampers the centre’s planning
and distribution work, and has a grave effect on every
branch of the national economy, because wood fuel is the
basis for the operation of all state industry and the
railways, while timber, apart from meeting the country’s acute
domestic needs, serves as a real basis for our foreign
trade, without which the economic revival of the
Republic is impossible. This is a categorical order to all timber
committees at once to regulate their reports on the
stocking, carting out and delivery of firewood, charcoal and
timber; all gubernia Cheka must see to the precise
observance of the deadlines and forms laid down by the C.A.T.I.
Under the personal responsibility of all timber committee
chairmen I demand precise and speedy replies with a list
of all those personally responsible for the submission of
reports.[2]

Commissars[1]

Comrade Gorbunov:

1) The pamphlet must be returned to the author (after
making a note of its title and the author’s place of
work).[1]

2) Try to find out in which libraries the book is
available.
 

3) Write to engineer N. S. Vetchinkin, asking him
whether he could write an article on this question for
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn or Izvestia.

Write a small pamphlet with the addition of conclusions
from the latest (1914–1921) foreign literature.

4) Propose that the S.E.C. Presidium should establish:

(a) the keeping of a correct inventory of our
road-building machinery, by agreement with the War Department;

Reinstein informed me yesterday that the American
millionaire Hammer, who is Russian-born (is in prison on a
charge of illegally procuring an abortion; actually, it is
said, in revenge for his communism), is prepared to give
the Urals workers 1,000,000 poods of grain on very, easy
terms (5 percent) and to take Urals valuables on commission
for sale in America.

This Hammer’s son (and partner), a doctor, is in Russia,
and has brought Semashko $60,000 worth of surgical
instruments as a gift. The son has visited the Urals with
Martens and has decided to help rehabilitate the Urals
industry.

An official report will soon be made by Martens.

Comrade Chicherin:

I doubt whether any other People’s Commissariat would
stand for that sort of thing. I think the business manager
P. P. Gorbunov is to blame. He should have worked out
and got through the Politbureau a precise statute of the
Moscow Committee’s powers, and to cover the fact that
without your consent the Moscow Committee is not
empowered to remove anyone (“remove” in the broad sense of
the word).

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Martens:

Can Hammer (Reinstein told me about
him[1]

)

be
persuaded to 

undertake the financing of the Rutgers group to save the
Urals, improving the composition of the group? by
including, say, four efficient Americans?

Let me have an answer to this as soon as possible.

Second. Can you get Hammer to take an interest in a
scheme to electrify the Urals, so that Hammer should
provide not only the grain, but also the electrical equipment
(naturally on a loan basis)?
 

Rutgers’s plan must be corrected (try to do this through
Hammer), and not simply
rejected.[2]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

he objected to the financing of these plans, because he doubted
that they would succeed.

Comrade Uglanov:

I am sending this to you and Komarov secretly.

Bear in mind that this has been decided before the
arrival of the commission of Kamenev + Orjonikidze +
Zalutsky and independently of them. The Petrograd Gubernia
Cheka is no use, it is not up to the mark, it is not clever.
We have to find better
men.[1]

Petrograd Gubernia Cheka. Having heard I. S. Unschlicht’s report
about the unsatisfactory composition of the Petrograd Gubernia
Cheka, the Politbureau decided: “To authorise Comrade
Unschlicht, together with the Orgbureau, to submit for approval
to the Politbureau, within three clays, a list of candidates for
heads of the Petrograd Cheka” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central

16.X.

Comrade Chicherin:

I do not agree with you in the assessment of the
situation or on the steps you
propose.[1] There can be no
question at all of Trotsky and myself withdrawing from the
Executive Committee of the Communist International.

It is quite enough for Krasin to make a statement on
the debts.

Urquhart has so far disagreed with the percentage level:

    

he offered 5 per cent of gross output, our commission
demanded 10 per cent.

The British and the French want to plunder us. That
we shall not allow. We shall pay no attention to their
“dissatisfaction” over this.

There is one concession: timber in the Caucasus. Trade
arrangements with the Germans are under way. They are
starting with Italy: she has offered a loan. This matter
should be speeded up and pushed forward by every means.

There is a contract with Armstrong on the boilers.
There is a contract with Norway.

The only “sharp turn” is with Britain and France, and
I do not see that we should make any concessions or steps.
Hoover is a real asset.

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On October 15, 1921, G. V. Chicherin wrote Lenin that the
dissolution of the All-Russia Famine Relief Committee, for its
counter-revolutionary activity, and the break-down of the
concession talks with Urquhart have worsened the international position
of the R.S.F.S.R. He proposed a number of steps which he believed
would improve relations with the capitalist countries, namely,
Lenin’s and Trotsky’s withdrawal from the Comintern Executive
Committee, a statement by the Soviet Government on recognition
of tsarist Russia’s debts, etc.

In the final sentence a reference is to the 1921 agreement with
ARA, which was headed by Herbert Hoover, on aid to the starving
in the Volga area (see this volume, Document 370).

Copy to Comrade Osinsky,


copy to Comrade Avanesov


for all C.L.D. members, circulate for all to read


and sign upon reading

17/X.1921   

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky:

I draw your attention to Comrade Rakovsky’s article,
“The Famine and Maize”, in Pravda No. 231 (14.X.1921).

In the light of this article, I feel sure that the conclusion
of the State Planning Commission’s agricultural section
on maize (of 13.IX.1921, signed by Comrade Sereda) is
inadequate.

The advantages of maize (and beans) appear to be proven
in several respects. Since this is so, faster and more
vigorous measures should be taken. Of especial importance is

    

the fact that the seed requirement is between one-tenth and
one-fifteenth of the normal quantity.

This appears to be the crucial consideration.

It should be decided right away that the total quantity
of maize required for the full sowing of all the spring area
throughout the Volga region should be purchased in good
time for the sowing in the spring of 1922.

To attain this aim, this should be paralleled by:

1) elaboration of very precise and very circumstantially
considered measures for the propaganda of maize and the
teaching of peasants to grow maize with the meagre
resources now available;

2) urgent discussion of whether practical ways and means
can be found to make maize a part of the people’s diet,
under the existing conditions in peasant farming, their
habits and way of life (cf. page 35, the State Planning
Commission’s memo).

I request an immediate discussion of these questions in
the agricultural section and the presidium, making sure to
collect every shade of opinion on maize.

Report to the C.L.D. on Friday,
21.X.1921.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Gosplan (State Planning Commission) report on the raising of
maize was on the C.L.D. agenda for October 21, 1921, but was
put off in order to have the People’s Commissariat for
Agriculture also take part in deciding this question, in connection with
the letter of October 17 from Deputy People’s Commissar for
Agriculture, N. Osinsky, who objected to the Gosplan’s
agricultural section submitting such important farming questions to
the C.L.D. on its own (see also this volume, Document 447).

17.X.1921   

Comrade Krestinsky:

I should like to know your opinion about whether or
not it is time to make these two kinds of calculations:

first, a plan (a quite rough and general plan, by way
of the first approximation) for restoring our currency. Say:
under such-and-such conditions, over a period of so many
years, it would be possible by consistently applying
such-and-such measures to achieve so-and-so.
 

Do you (and the finance commission) believe that such
a calculation is possible or that even an approximate
calculation of this kind is premature and impossible for the
time being?

Second, is it possible to convert our expenditure budget
into gold and compare it (on the main heads—and perhaps
by departments and regions, gubernias, capitals, etc., as
far as possible) with pre-war figures?

We should make a start, and as soon as possible, on a
reform, through such or similar calculation, of our quite
neglected and irrelevantly, spontaneously, and irregularly
inflated budget.

I request you to let me have your opinion on this matter
and—if you have no special objections—to raise it in the
finance commission.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Popov:

I have received the statistical tables of population by
administrative division of the R.S.F.S.R.

1) I request that they be specified in publication (for
instance, it is not said that they are after the census of
August 28, 1920).

2) The autonomous regions and republics (the Karelian
Labour Commune, the Bashkirian, the Tatar, etc.) should be
brought out from the list of gubernias and given separately,
checking (when in doubt) with the People’s Commissariat for
Internal Affairs and the People’s Commissariat for Justice.

3) The summing-up should bring together the large
divisions, repeating them 
    

approximately

( European Russia,
R.S.F.S.R. proper;
autonomous republics
Ukrainian S.S.R.,

in this way
Turkestan,

Caucasian Republic,
I Far-Eastern, etc.


4) Check up once again whether the same territories, e.g.,
the Bashkirian Republic, have been taken for 1914 and 1897

1920 1,268,132

1914
357,700 (?? obvious error)


5) Add a short text (in accordance with the pamphlet
issued by the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs) on
the changes (within the uyezds and volosts) in the
gubernias and regions.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.

P.S. Another desirable addition, if that is not too much
trouble: the area, population 1897 and 1914 (if available)
of the states within the old Russian Empire which have
seceded from the R.S.F.S.R.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.

P.P.S. Is it possible also to add the number of uyezds,
volosts, towns and villages (as in the 1914–1915 yearbook).

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.L.D.

G. M.:

This is secret.

Read it and return this very day, tomorrow morning, at
the latest.
 

The
author[1] is partly right: I shall change the
assignment to the State Planning Commission in the conclusion
(assignment to the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture).

Please think about the way to co-ordinate and specify
S.P.C. tasks and let me have your plan (draft decision
on drawing a line of distinction between S.P.C. and the
planning commissions) in writing.

With communist greetings,

Notes
 
 



[1]
The author is N. Osinsky, Deputy People’s Commissar for
Agriculture, who in his letter of October 17, in reply to Lenin’s letter
(see this volume, Document 444), insisted on a legal settlement

   

of the relations between the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture
and Gosplan. He proposed that Gosplan’s role should be confined
“only to a general co-ordination of plans submitted by the
departments; Gosplan is not to work out any plans on its own,
everything being done in the planning commissions of the
Commissariats” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

In reply, G. M. Krzhizhanovsky wrote that N. Osinsky was
right “in the sense that Gosplan’s work should have a follow-up
character. But it is wrong to interpret this as meaning that the
people at Gosplan should in some way engage in ‘summarising’,
without having special sections which make use of some of the
departmental specialists. I have already raised with all the
sections the question of transforming and delimiting the work of
primary planning organs and our own work” (ibid.),
Krzhizhanovsky went on to set out a number of measures to improve the
work of Gosplan.

Comrade Mikhailov:

I propose that the enclosed should be circulated to all
members of the Politbureau, that is, each should read,
make his remarks, and send it on to the next person (or to
you).

If no one insists on a discussion in the Politbureau, then
the decision of the majority should be entered in the
minutes right away.

With, communist greetings,

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter to the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee in connection with the request
from the Soviet, Ambassador to Turkey, S. P. Natsarenus, for
instructions concerning the line of behaviour over the French
proposals to President Kemal of the Turkish Republic to conclude
an agreement containing articles aimed against the Soviet country.
Natsarenus communicated his talks with Kemal, who had
reportedly rejected all articles aimed against Soviet Russia. Natsarenus
wrote that he had intimated to Kemal that Turkey’s conclusion
of an agreement containing such articles would force the Soviet
Government, to take steps to have Britain withhold recognition
of the agreement and, in addition, to reinforce the troops on the
Soviet-Turkish border. Chicherin proposed that the Politbureau
should adopt a decision confirming the correctness of thy action
taken by Natsarenus and recognising it as adequate.

To all members of the Politbureau

I am against the underlined
proposal.[2] Such steps will
merely create an impression of our weakness: as has always
happened in such cases, the opponent will become
impudent. I consider Krasin’s interview and polemics in the
press to be enough. I request Comrade Mikhailov to ask
Comrade Chicherin for my previous note to him on this
matter, and to have it circulated also among the Politbureau
members.[1]

reiterating his proposal that the Soviet Government should issue a
statement on recognition of tsarist Russia’s debts (see this

2) Have the projects for the construction of this station,
the basic data of the project: capacity, type, etc., been
worked out and approved?

3) How the project administration is organised; the
number of offices; their location; relations with each other and
the centre; to whom the construction is directly
subordinate here, at the centre; relations between the construction
bodies and the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Soviet
establishments; the name, office and record of the chief
persons responsible for construction; those here, at the centre,
directly responsible for the whole undertaking.
 

4) The number of industrial and office workers
employed by the project administration and at the building site
on May 1 and October 1, including the staffs of all the central

what has actually been done since the start of construction.

7) Supply of the building site for 1921 and 1922 with:
food,


building and technical materials, and manpower, etc.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written in connection with the report from N. N.
Kolotilov, Chairman of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Executive
Committee, about mismanagement and the fact that the
construction site was run by several offices with many employees
and few workers.

That same day, N. P. Gorbunov, on Lenin’s assignment, had
a talk with N. N. Kolotilov.

On October 20, 1921, the Administration for Electrotechnical
Structures sent in detailed replies to Lenin’s questions.

Comrade Martens:

If Hammer is in earnest about his plan to supply 1
million poods of grain to the Urals (and it is my impression
from your letter that your written confirmation of
Reinstein’s words makes one believe that he is, and that the
plan is not just so much hot air), you must try and give
the whole matter the precise juridical form of a contract
or
concession.[1]

 

Let it be a concession, even if a fictitious one (asbestos
or any other Urals valuables or what have you). What we
want to show and have in print (later, when performance
begins) is that the Americans have gone in for concessions.
This is important politically. Let me have your reply.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Radchenko:

I recommend to you the bearer of this, Nikolai
Alexandrovich Yemelyanov. Please let him have a 6–month
assignment for work abroad, so as to give him a chance to recover
from the hard labour in Petrograd, and have a change of
work.

I know Nikolai Alexandrovich very well personally, and am
sure that this comrade, this absolutely honest and most loyal
Communist, with vast human, industrial and Party
experience, can and must be used for cleansing the Augean stables
of stealing and sabotage by the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade officials abroad. Please phone me today.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Lengnik:

Please read this letter and phone me (we shall later also
show this letter to Iv. Iv. Radchenko). It is my earnest
request that Yemelyanov should be given a suitable
assignment abroad soon.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Under a decision of the Moscow Cheka Collegium, a case
of red tape at the People’s Commissariat for Food (the case
of Yakov Stepanovich Artyukhov) was referred to
you.[1]

Please have this important case tried as soon as
possible and let me know the judgement.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

P.S. It is of exceptional importance—both from the
Party and the political standpoint—especially in pursuance
of the decision of the Eighth Congress of
Soviets,[2] to have
the proceedings in the red tape case arranged with the
greatest solemnity, making the trial educational, and the
sentence sufficiently impressive.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At the end of July, Y. S. Artyukhov, Head of the Planning
Sub-Department of the Procurement Administration of the People’s

   

Commissariat for Food, was sent a petition requesting a reduction
of the tax in kind in two volosts of Novokamenka Uyezd, Moscow
Gubernia, which had suffered from a fall of hail. Artyukhov did
nothing about the petition until October 1921.





[2]
Having discussed the question of improving the work of Soviet
organs in the centre and in the localities, and the struggle against
red tape, the Eighth Congress of Soviets (December 22–29, 1920)
adopted a comprehensive decision on Soviet government
organisation.

Comrade Stalin:

Have a look at this, please, and if possible, inquire from
some of the old Party men, Armenians, perhaps. I knew
Lalayants from the 1890s on as a Marxist and then a
Bolshevik. He is undoubtedly a loyal revolutionary, who must
be used despite our political
differences.[1]

20/X.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written on Y. I. Vishnyak’s letter to Lenin of
September 10, 1921, about I. Kh. Lalayants.

By political differences Lenin meant the following passage in
Vishnyak’s letter: “After the liberation of Irkutsk, Comrade
Lalayants tried to understand what was taking place in Soviet
Russia at the time, and to analyse the R.C.P.’s tactics. He often used
to quote to me that part of your report on the agrarian question
at the Stockholm Congress, in which you pointed out that a social
revolution in the West was the only guarantee against any
restoration after the victory of the revolution in Russia. Our state
of isolation, the discrepancy between our political strength and
the economic foundation, and a number of other questions to
which he has not yet found an answer, prevent him from joining
the R.C.P.” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On Vishnyak’s letter is also J. V. Stalin’s reply: “I, too, favour
summoning Lalayants for work in Moscow” (Lenin Miscellany
XXXV, p. 278).

I. Kh. Lalayants was summoned to Moscow and worked at
the People’s Commissariat for Education.

Chubar and Rakovsky

Today, on a report concerning the transportation of
foodstuffs from the Ukraine, the C.L.D. decided that considering
that you have undertaken to load the grain for the centre
with your own means, and considering that it has reached
hardly a quarter of the established rate, we shall be forced
to appoint our own representative to the Ukraine, unless
there is a radical improvement in this matter within the
next three days. The C.L.D. requests an immediate reply
to this C.L.D.

Comrade Alsky:

Please have information sent me on the reserve, emergency
fund of bank-notes:

(1) monthly, so long as the fund is not < 1,000,000
million, 

(2) twice a month, if it is not < 500,000 million, 

(3) weekly, if it is not < 250,000 million, 

(4) daily, if less.

Also let me know the procedure governing the expenditure
of the emergency fund (who has the right to make
disbursements? what are the formalities involved? etc.).

Think this over and let me know with the utmost secrecy,
in a sewn-up and sealed envelope, addressed for personal
delivery, into Lenin’s own hands, from
Alsky.[1]

In view of the request from Iv. Iv. Skvortsov (Stepanov),
please cancel his business trip and banish him instead to

enable him to complete within four or six weeks, the
writing he has undertaken, without being distracted by other
business. (Find the state farm through the Moscow organ

Comrade Novitsky:

Perhaps, it will be clearer this way:

column 3: actual amount in hand
and issued (—), 

this will then give below the figure:
remaining in hand

+ and next to this

columns 6 and 6 bis, to whom, where,
when, whose decision,
Then

allocations 4 + 8 + 9

10th in the 4th from the top
and then

amount in hand minus allocations,
i.e., 5th column.

Such tables (as you have been sending me) must be top
secret,[1]


For this, I think, only two copies must be made (one
for you+one for me for the Politbureau) without retyping.
Add another column: earmarked by the C.C., perhaps
under this head:

Earmarked under a report by
Comrade Molotov:
when earmarked,
how much,
aim.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

P.S. Return this to me with your mark and the
enclosures.

22/X.

Comrade Sosnovsky:

I have received your letter concerning Yezhov.

I very much doubt that we could afford to let 1,000–
1,500 warehouse and office workers get

1,250,000–1,500,000 (Soviet) rubles a month.

Hardly.

I think: work out bonuses for rapid clearing of warehouse
in economic enterprise (state plant, factory, state farm,
etc.).

It is up to Yezhov to put through your other proposals
(and a copy for me).

Let us have a precise and short draft.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Written in reply to L. S. Sosnovsky’s letter, setting out his       

plan to improve the work of the S.E.C.’s state warehouses. Among    

the measures he proposed were: to secure a salary of from 30 to    

50 gold rubles for 1,000–1,500 warehouse workers and employees,     


   

and up to 75 rubles for executive workers; to set deadlines for the    

storage of goods, etc.

To all Regional and Gubernia Conferences,


Special Committee, Kharkov

In view of the reported cases of regional and gubernia
economic organs making unwarranted changes in the
distribution plans based on decisions by the Central Committee
of the Fuel Workers’ Union, and in some instructions issued
by the Central Fuel Administration, which tends to ruin
the rhythm of the fuel supply operation, I propose that no
more arbitrary changes should be allowed in the future in
any case. When such are necessary, however, agree matters
beforehand with the Central Fuel Administration or
introduce in the C.L.D. Execution of this shall be the personal
responsibility of the economic conference chairmen. Inform
of receipt and
execution.[1]

Lenin

Chairman, C.L.D.

22/X.   

Comrade Kursky:

I enclose material on the S.K.F. concession (Bogdanov has
the contract and the other material).

You are aware of this matter.

Please return this to me with your opinion.

You will recall that you objected to it over the warehouse.

Couldn’t we do it this way: find the form (suitable,
convenient) for two transactions: under one transaction, the
S.K.F. will purchase the whole warehouse from us.
(Recognition of our title: that is the essence, after all.)

Under the other—we shall buy from them items to the
amount stated in the contract.
 

As a result, we pay them this
amount.[1]

Is it possible to ensure our interests in any other way?
I doubt it.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Chicherin:

See letter,


p. 4
and over.

Lenin

October 22, 1921

Dear Vladimir Ilyich:

Today’s coded message from Comrade Krasin, a part of
which has reached us, on Urquhart’s statements and campaign
shows that the matter is much more serious, and cannot be
explained solely by bluff designed to secure 5 per cent royalties
on the concessions. There has apparently been some
disappointment over our new line. Naturally, in the establishment of
such a complex historic combination, as concessions to West
European capitalists under a Bolshevik government, the
arranging of these combinations does not proceed smoothly or at
once. The more reason, therefore, for us to see to it that these

?

frictions are overcome. I personally am quite unaware of the

?

springs of our policy which caused a certain turn in our line

?

at the end of August, so that I am altogether not competent to
say whether such a turn had been necessary....

Comrade Chicherin:

There was not the slightest shadow of a “turn in our
line” in August (see page 1). We have never taken a pledge
and will never take a pledge not to arrest swindlers, not
to shoot plotters, riot to reject excessively greedy
proposals by concessionaires.
 

On the debt question, I advise you to put through the
Politbureau the appointment of a commission (your
candidates?) to check up on the state of work of the Groman
and Goikhbarg commissions.

I personally see nothing in “Krasin’s facts”, etc., except
Urquhart’s blackmail.

They will hazard an intervention in spring, if they can
force Poland: nothing can be done to prevent this except
strengthening our defence capacity.

Mikhalsky writes about new turns by Britain. What is
the point there? What do you think? Is it that they are
afraid of Washington, and want to “placate” France and
intimidate Russia?

Agreements and concessions with the Americans are of
exceptional importance to us: we have something (not a
little) with Hoover. We almost have something with
Hammer. Amruss is on the
way.[2]

Everything should be done (by you especially) to
eliminate all friction (regrettable and harmful) between
Litvinov and
Martens.[1]


Yours,

Lenin

Association, later renamed the Russo-American Industrial
Corporation (Rusaminco or RAIC). It was set up by the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers of America. On October 12, 1921, a model
agreement was concluded between the R.S.F.S.R. and the
Russo-American Trade and Industrial Association.

Comrade Stalin:

The estimate seems to he exaggerated. But, I must admit,
I a in not acquainted with the scope of the Orgbureau’s
“distributive” work. I think the motivation is correct.
The first thing to do is to reduce the “indent” in respect
of the non-economic People’s Commissariats.

office in the People’s Commissariats, so as to concentrate the best    

part of them at the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, which,

October 24

Comrade Chicherin:

I am sending you my amendments and request you to
return thorn with your comment.

No. 1) We do not have 150 but 130 million including
the Far-Eastern Republic.

No. 2) Not to “yield”, but to make a number of
concessions.

No. 3) The main thing: our claims to them should be
stated subtly and precisely.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Draft Declaration

The Brussels Conference of representatives of the Powers,
according to the West European press, has set as a condition for granting
credits to the Government, of Russia in aid of the starving its
recognition of the debts of the former Russian governments. Nothing has yet
been communicated to the Government of Russia about the decisions
of this conference. However, the Government of Russia, in face of
the starving masses, refuses to abide by the subtleties of diplomatic
etiquette and feels it to be its bounden duty to declare here and now
its attitude to the Brussels decisions. The British Prime Minister,
Mr. Lloyd George, in his speech in the British Parliament on August 
16, said that the proposal to use the famine in Russia to force her
to recognise the tsarist government’s debts was a devilish scheme.
Nevertheless, the Brussels Conference, being quite aware that, in
view of the scale of the famine disaster in Russia, the Soviet
Government is incapable, with its own resources, to save the famine-stricken
population, has made the granting of credits to Russia, without which
serious aid to the starving is impossible, contingent on the Soviet
Government’s recognition of the old debts.

Drawing the attention of the toiling masses in all countries and
of all citizens who cherish humanitarian considerations, to these acts
of the Brussels Conference, the Government of Russia hereby declares
that the proposal to have the old debts recognised on certain terms
now meets its own intentions. Since its inception, the Soviet
Government has set itself economic co-operation with other Powers as one
of the main aims of its policy. It has always declared its readiness
to make available sufficient profit to foreign capitalists who would

    

help it to work Russia’s natural resources and rehabilitate her
economic apparatus. At present, it says that the official statements of
the President of the United States of America and of the Ministers
of Great Britain have repeatedly expressed the idea that three years
after the end of the world war there is still no real peace, the plight
of the masses is becoming ever more acute, state debts are increasing
and there is growing economic dislocation.

It is quite obvious that it is inconceivable to establish full peace
without Russia, with her 150 million population, that the economic
dislocation cannot be overcome, so long as Russia is left in ruins,


||
No. 1
130


and that the question of relations between Russia and the rest of the
world, which is a paramount world question, cannot be solved without
an agreement with the Soviet Government. From the standpoint of;
the long-term interests and constant requirements of all states and
all peoples, the economic rehabilitation of Russia is a prime
necessity not only for her but for them as well. Without economic
co-operation with other countries, the task of Russia’s economic revival
proves to be exceptionally difficult, and its fulfilment is sure to be
dragged out over a much longer period.

This task can be best carried out by a workers’ and peasants’
government. It is not hampered in its work of rehabilitating the
national economy by the private self-seeking interests of separate groups
of capitalists. A workers’ and peasants’ power is guided immediately
by the interests of the broadest masses of people which, in essence,
amount to the interests of society as a whole. With its purpose of
satisfying the interests of all the toiling people of Russia, the workers’
and peasants’ power, which has emerged victorious from the
incredible ordeals of the Civil War, holds out to private initiative and capital
the opportunity of co-operating with the workers’ and peasants’
power in developing Russia’s natural resources. The Soviet
Government has restored private trade, private property in small
enterprises, and the right of concession and lease of large enterprises.

The Soviet power holds out to foreign capital a sufficient part of
the profit to satisfy its interests, so as to attract it to participation
in economic work in Russia. Following this path, the Soviet
Government strives to have economic agreements with all the Powers, for
which purpose there is ultimately a need to conclude a final peace
settlement between Russia and other states. With this task before
it, the Soviet power has met with the demand on the part of the other
Powers for recognition of the tsarist government’s old debts.

The Soviet Government declares that it is firmly
convinced that no people is obliged to pay the cost
of the chains it has worn for centuries. But in its
firm resolve to reach full agreement with the other


||
No. 2
make a
number of
substantial
concessions


Powers, the Government of Russia is prepared to
yield on this cardinal question. In this way it also
meets the desires of many small holders of Russian
state loans, especially in France, for whom its
recognition of tsarist debts is of substantial interest.
On the strength of these considerations, the
Government of Russia declares that it is prepared to

    

recognise its obligations to other states and their citizens
on state loans contracted by the tsarist government
before 1914, provided it is granted easy terms, giving
it a practical possibility of meeting these obligations.

It goes without saying that an indispensable
prerequisite of such recognition shall be the
simultaneous obligation on the part of the Great Powers
unconditionally to end all acts threatening the
security of the Soviet Republics and the immunity of
their boundaries. In other words, the Soviet
Republic will undertake these obligations only in the event
the Great Powers conclude with it a final general
peace, and if its government is recognised by the
other Powers.

With that end in view, the Government of Russia
proposes the early convocation of an international
conference to deal with the tasks indicated above, to
examine the reciprocal demands of the other


No. 3
reciprocal
claims
X on each other
X on the other
Powers


Powers &Vwhatthe and the Government of Russia &whatthe and work out
a final peace treaty between them. Only after the
convocation of this conference will it be possible to
reach a general peace settlement. This will in no sense
be achieved by the Washington Conference, whose
decisions will not be recognised by the Republic of Russia,
which has not been invited to attend the conference.

On the fourth anniversary of the Soviet Government, to be marked
in a few days, everyone will have to recognise that the efforts of its
numerous external and internal enemies have merely served to
consolidate the workers’ and peasants’ power in Russia, as the true
defender and representative of the interests of the toiling masses of
Russia, and of her independence. The fresh interventionist designs
against Soviet Russia, whose existence is evident from the numerous
statements by the leading organs of the press in the Entente countries,
will merely help to strengthen the indissoluble bonds between the
toiling masses of Russia and the workers’ and peasants’ power, which
represents their will, but any attempt to implement these schemes
can merely increase the suffering of the toiling masses, and delay the
moment of Russia’s eventual economic rehabilitation, thereby also
delivering a blow at the economic interests of all other peoples.

The proposal being put forward by the Government of Russia is
the best evidence of its urge for peace with all states, and the
establishing with them of undisturbed economic relations. It is in the
interests of all states and peoples that this proposal should be realised.
The Government of Russia expresses the firm hope that its
proposal will shortly result in the achievement of a final settlement of
economic and political relations between Russia and the other states.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of repaying Russia’s old debts was raised at the
Brussels Conference, which was held from October 6 to 8, 1921,
and was attended by 19 states, including Belgium, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Rumania,
China and others, and also by representatives of the International
Red Cross and ARA.

The conference recommended that the governments should
extend credits to Soviet Russia to combat the famine only if she
recognised the debts of the old governments and allowed a commission
to control the distribution of food.

On October 27, the question of recognising the debts of the old
governments was discussed by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee, which decided “to adopt the text proposed
by Comrade Chicherin, with Comrade Lenin’s amendments as
a basis, and to authorise Comrade Chicherin to publish it over
his signature” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee). The Soviet
Government’s statement on the recognition of the old debts, with Lenin’s
amendments, was sent to the Governments of Great Britain,
France, Italy, Japan and the U.S.A. on October 28 (see Pravda
No. 243 of October 29, 1921). The official text differs slightly
from the wording of the draft published in this volume.

Comrade Chicherin:

I think that the Government should not, must not deny
such silly rumours. The thing to do is to give them to the
press and to ridicule, make a laughing-stock of those who
believe these rumours and circulate them. This is
blackmail on the part of the Urquharts and the Curzons: such
rumours are designed to hamper agreement at present. This
is patent blackmail.

This was written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter, setting out the
news dispatch by the American correspondent to the effect that
foreign capitalists were unwilling to take out concessions in Soviet
Russia because of the stubborn rumours that the Soviet
Government would shortly return to foreign businessmen full title in
their old factories. Chicherin proposed a denial of these rumours.


On the document is also Lenin’s note: “Why did you send me

Comrade Stalin:

Please read this and pass on to Comrade Mikhailov.

I very strongly recommend the bearer of this, Comrade
Nikolai Alexandrovich Alexeyev.

I have known him since 1902, when we worked together
on Iskra in London.

He is a very well-educated Marxist, a Bolshevik and a
comrade who is remarkably honest in doing his duty.

He has been tossed out into Siberia for about 10 years,
and would now like to make his way back to the centre. He
should be helped to move to the centre, because a ten-year
stay in Siberia is too much; worse than too much.

He should be replaced in Siberia by someone of the
absolutely reliable, honest old Party men: the “Communists”
in Siberia have been committing a host of shocking things
and
stupidities.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On October 28, 1921, the Orgbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central    

Committee decided to recall N. A. Alexeyev and place him at     

the disposal of the Central Committee.

Comrade Gorbunov:

N. M. Knipovich is an outstanding scientific authority
and an unquestionably honest man, a man of rare honesty.
That is why we should show full confidence and accept his
proposal immediately. Get it through the Narrow C.P.C.
quickly, and let me know if there is the slightest delay.

26/X.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written on N. M. Knipovich’s letter, setting out a
request of the Conseil Permanent International pour
l’exploration de la mer for a return, as Russia’s contribution for the budget
year of 1914/15, of 14,000 rubles on deposits with the
Azov-Don Bank. Knipovich noted the great scientific importance of
the Council’s work and said that Russia should not “remain
outside this endeavour when international relations were
normalised” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee), See also Lenin Miscellany
XXXV, p. 288.

       To Politbureau members

I consider Comrade Kursky’s conclusion the only correct
one. I propose that it be passed as a supplemental
C.P.C.
decision.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with D. I. Kursky’s conclusion on the
question of a concession for the Swedish S.K.F., proposing two
variants for an additional agreement on the controversial issue of
ball-bearing warehouses nationalised by the Soviet slate. On
October 27, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee recognised as desirable the continuation of the talks with
the Swedish, company and conclusion of an agreement on the basis
of one of Kursky’s variants.

Copy to Comrade Bogdanov

27.X.1921

Comrade Martens:

I have received both
contracts.[1] I am returning them.

Why are the additional points which Reinstein and
Hammer showed me (in the draft) not there?

They should be given the final drafting and passed as
soon as possible.

Special attention must be given to our thorough actual
fulfilment of the terms.

There must be no reliance on orders!

Without a triple check-up our men will spoil everything
and will fail to do anything right.

An intelligent, competent man should be appointed as
personally responsible and checked up on.

We must make a special effort to nurse the
concessionaires: this is of exceptional economic and political
importance.

Let me know precisely what measures you or the S.E.C.
Presidium are taking.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

P.S. A point to be specially cleared up whether this
should be made public.

There is much indication that it is of great importance
for us to have this concession and the contract publicised
as widely as possible.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the agreements on an asbestos concession and the
purchase of a million poods of grain from Armand Hammer.

Additional points—amendments to the concession agreement
proposed by Hammer. A draft additional decision, adopted by
the C.L.D. on October 28, 1921, provided for the extension of
guarantees to the concessionaires that their property would be
protected, that their personnel would have the right of free
movement in the country, free entry into and exit from the country
when dealing with concession business, etc.

Comrade Radchenko:

Comrade Martens has sent me the contract with the
American company (Hammer and Mishell) signed by you.
 

I believe this contract to be of enormous importance,
as marking the beginning of trade.

It is absolutely necessary that you should give special
attention to the actual fulfilment of our obligations.

I am sure that not a damn thing will be done unless there
is exacting pressure and supervision. Take measures of
triple precaution and check up on the performance.

Let me know whom you appoint as responsible executive;
which goods you are preparing; whether you are making a
special emphasis on art and
Gokhran[1]

items, etc.

Send me reports two or three times a month: what has
come into port.

28/X.

Comrade Mikhailov:

Please have this urgently circulated among the
Politbureau members (if they approve, agree with Bogdanov and
Chicherin and send off this very day).

Recognising it as being vastly important that Krasin
should manage to go to America before the Washington
Conference;

—recognising it as being equally important that
American capital should take an interest in our oil, I propose that
the following reply telegram should be sent to Krasin this
very day (coded, of course):

“Agree to appropriate up to 100,000 dollars to pay for

    

exploration by the Foundation Company, provided our
workers and specialists take part and all the details of the
exploration are delivered to us. We believe it to be vastly
important to attract American capital for the construction
of a paraffin separation plant and an oil pipeline in
Grozny. We request that this matter be got under way with
utmost speed and vigour, because your trip before the
Washington Conference opens is of especial importance.”

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a telegram from London on October 19, 1921, L. B. Krasin
reported the talks he had started with an American building
company, the Foundation Company, which had contracts with the
leading oil corporations. A spokesman of this Company declared
that, it was prepared to undertake the construction of a paraffin
separation plant, and a pipeline between Grozny and the Black
Sea, provided the Company’s engineers carried out the
explorations. Krasin proposed that the necessary fund:; should be
allocated for this purpose. The draft telegram to Krasin here published
was approved by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee on October 28. See also Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, pp. 357–
58.

Comrade Preobrazhensky:

Read this and return to
me.[2]

I see that your optimism is refuted by the facts with
increasing frequency.

There is need at all costs to work out:

1) calendar programme and

2) planned estimate:

(α) a given minimum of workers at such-and-such
a rate so many thousand millions;

(β) debts coming to so much;

(γ) will cover by the following date, in this
priority.

But, what is more, we must work a radical change in
the whole pace of our monetary reform.
Periculum in
mora.[1]

All such matters must be agreed with the People’s

To have business conducted haphazardly by individual

Gubernia, assures me that the whole tax in kind will be
brought in within three weeks. Please let me know in a few
words what your information is, and how frequently you
have been receiving telegrams about the collection of the
tax in kind. The model gubernias or uyezds will have to be
specially rewarded.

What measures are being taken to concentrate the salt
stock and also to see that the salt is not sold otherwise
than for grain either in the R.S.F.S.R. or the Ukraine.
Perhaps we should also limit the issue of salt in the towns,
to hamper the anarchic exchange of goods for salt.

Comrade Tsyurupa, Chief Engineer,


Kashira Construction Site

Not enough foresight was shown in the receipt, without
any delay, of-transformers and transformer oil from Sweden.

It is intolerable for foreign equipment to “be lying
about” at the Moscow customs house, as Vishnyak says it
has been.

You are to blame for having failed to take all measures
actually ensuring the rapid receipt of the equipment
(receipt at Revel of the precise specific,alien and addresses
should have been seen to).

Your reference to the fact that the specification says
“for the Kashira station” turned cut to be invalid, and
you failed to make special contact with the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade.

Measures must, be taken for the future to have the precise
addresses at every point and direction indicated, and the
men personally responsible designated.

Inform Comrade Smolyaninov about the measures
taken.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of Labour and Defence
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

G. D. Tsyurupa reported to Lenin that the delay in the delivery
of the materials was due to the fact that the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade failed to inform the Kashira construction
site about the arrival of the cargoes to Moscow.

On November 14, S.E.C. Chairman P. A. Bogdanov sent on
this letter from Lenin and G. D. Tsyurupa’s reply to the People’s
Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection to conduct
an inquiry into who was actually to blame for the red tape.

Let’s have the figure:

1) how many-fold will your denomination increase the
emission?

2) Why not (later) worsen the quality of the bank-notes
to speed up their self-liquidation?
    

      2

Your arguments against the module 1 : 50,000:

1) the worker will receive 25,000 rubles=1/4 ruble!!

2) the price of gold will be disproportional.


And with 10,000?

1) the worker will receive 25,000 rubles=2 1/2 rubles.
All-Russia C.E.C. members receive 27,000=2
rubles 70 kopeks a month, 

2) gold?

Does not your argument boil down in essence to the need
to keep open the possibility to yet another “retreat” when
we put paper on a par with gold (within a year, two, etc.)
only after the exchange rate of the ruble is consolidated?

Meanwhile

a) there is need for an emission

b) 1 : 10,000==cautious probe, “probing the soil”.
3

1) Semyon Yenukidze has calculated:

roughly the same quantity of paper (13,000 and 12,000
poods) gives


4,500 thousand million old rubles, and 457 million
new ones, i.e., the same 4,500 thousand million old
ones.

Is that so?

What, does it give us?

2) Isn’t it better to use bad paper to allow the issued
money to be self-liquidated faster?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The notes were written in connection with the preparation for        

denomination as a means of regulating the currency of money and      

stabilising the ruble. Under a C.P.C. decree of November 3, 192!,    

one ruble of the new issue was equal to 10,000 of the old issues     

(see Izvestia VTslK No. 263, November 26, 1921).

Mongolian People’s Republic and had a talk with it (see present
edition, Vol. 42, pp. 360–61).

The communique of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs on the signing of the Soviet-Mongolian Treaty was

3.XI.1921   

Dear Mr. Armand Hammer!

Comrade Reinstein tells me you are leaving Moscow
tonight. I am very sorry I am occupied at the session of the
Central Committee of our Party. I am extremely sorry I am
unable to see you once more and greet you.

Please be so kind and greet your father, Jim Larkin,
Ruthenberg and Ferguson, all best comrades now in
American gaols. My best sympathy and best wishes to all them.

Once more best greetings to you and your friends in
connection with flour for our workers and your concession.
The beginning is extremely important. I hope it will be
the beginning of extreme importance.

With best wishes


Yours truly,


Lenin

P.S. I beg to apologise for my extremely bad English.

Comrade Kursky, People’s Commissariat for Justice

In my letter No. 809 of September 3, I made you
personally responsible for a number of assignments and

    

requested that you should inform me regularly about their
execution.[1]


Please let me know how the following tasks have been
fulfilled:

1) to pull up the judges through the C.C. so that they
punish red tape more severely;

2) to arrange a conference of the Moscow people’s
judges, members of tribunals, etc., to work out effective
measures to combat red tape;

3) without fail, this autumn and winter of 1921–1922, to
bring up for trial in Moscow 4-6 cases of Moscow red tape,
selecting the more “vivid” cases, and making each trial a
political affair;

4) to find some, if only 2-3, sensible “experts” on
questions of red tape, among the more fierce and militant
Communists (get hold of Sosnovsky), so as to train people to
weed out red tape;

5) to publish a good, intelligent, non-bureaucratic letter
(a circular of the People’s Commissariat for Justice) on
fighting red
tape.[2]

Chairman of the C.P.C.
 

Notes
 

[1]
See present edition, Vol. 35, Document 298.—Ed.
 



[2]
In reply to this letter, People’s Commissar for Justice, D. I.
Kursky, on November 14, 1921, sent Lenin a report from the
investigation department of the, People’s Commissariat for Justice over
the first half-year of 1921 on 18 cases involving red tape. Kursky
wrote that most of these cases ended with the imposition of
disciplinary penalties, a part of them were wound up and “cases could
be referred to the courts (Revolutionary Tribunal and the People’s

   

Courts) only by way of exception”. Reporting the preparation of
exemplary trials, he said they were now considering the renewal of
the panels of the people’s judges in Moscow (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

Kursky’s reply did not satisfy Lenin and he wrote to him once
again (see present edition, Vol. 35, Document 306).

Comrade Alsky:

I am sending this request of Shvedchikov’s on to you.

Unless we pull it out now, the paper industry will
collapse for a whole year. We must do our utmost.

Let me know what you are doing. Perhaps I should
appoint an emergency
commission?[1]

5/XI. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on a note from the C.P.C. agent for the paper industry
and printing production, K. M. Shvedchikov, who requested the
“setting aside of a reserve monetary fund for the publishing
business (Gosizdat, Glavbum, Poligrafotdel and Tsentropechat) in the
amount of up to 319,000 million rubles”; and “that an advance
payment of 60,000 million rubles be made before the 15th of
November proportional to the applications of separate establishments”.

This question was examined by an emergency commission under
the Budget Estimates Administration of the People’s
Commissariat for Finance on November 9. It said the request was not
sufficiently well grounded, and instructed representatives of the
S.E.C. and the People’s Commissariat for Finance to verify it
and give their conclusion.

On November 9, Shvedchikov sent another letter to Lenin (see
Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 54,
Document 33).

Comrade Bogdanov

Copies to Comrades Khinchuk and Radchenko

Comrade Bogdanov:

Steinberg’s “concession” (buying up of hides and skins
plus import of commodity-exchange fund from abroad) is
being examined, as I beard in the C.L.D. yesterday, in
the S.E.C. Commission for
Utilisation.[1]

Strictly speaking, it is not a concession in the usual
sense of the word, and both the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade and Centrosoyuz must be brought in for its
examination (especially since Khinchuk declared yesterday
that he takes a negative view of Steinberg). 

Be sure to have Khinchuk take part in the discussion,
and, while we are about it, let’s think over a statute for
a somewhat different make-up of commissions to discuss
“this type” of
“concession”.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Commission for the Utilisation of Material Resources was set
up by a C.P.C. decree of November 21, 1918, under the S.E.C. A
C.P.C. decision of March 17, 1921, transferred the Commission
to the competence of the C.L.D. It was the highest authority for
the distribution of material resources, and its decisions entered
into force unless protested against in the C.L.D. within three
days of the decision and rescinded by the C.L.D. All the
departments had the duty to submit well-founded estimates for
consideration by the Commission. See this volume, Document 526.





[2]

“Concession agreement for the collection and trade in hides and
skins with P. B. Steinberg” was submitted by the S.E.C. for the
C.P.C.’s approval on November 21, 1921. On November 29, the
C.P.C. instructed a commission, consisting of V. V. Gombarg,
A. M. Lezhava and A. L. Scheinman, to review the agreement
and to continue talks with the other party. For the decision on
this question Lenin made the following proposals by way of
directives for the commission: =

“α) amount of duties (the point is
crossed out and is not included in the decision.—Ed.); =

β)
checkup on the actual amount, of leather procured by the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade up to now... =

γ) check-up on the
possible and probable development of operations by the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade and Centrosoyuz, given the
expenditure of a definite amount of bank-notes” (Lenin Miscellany
XXIII, p. 187). After repeated discussion, the C.P.C. on January

   

10, 1922, rejected the concession and authorised a specially
appointed commission to work out a statute for organising the
procurement of hides and skins at home on shareholding principles.
On January 24, the C.P.C. approved the basis of the draft rules
of the “Joint-Stock Company for Domestic and Export Trade in
Hides and Skins” (“Kozhsyryo”). On February 1, 1922, the C.L.D.
approved the rules of the Company and its articles of association.
See this volume, Documents 515 and 589.

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please send to Krasin in code.

Your dispatch of 1.XI is almost hysterical. You have
forgotten that even you yourself had not proposed that we
should give in to Leslie Urquhart right away, while the
Politbureau decision is very well considered and is not a
refusal. Concerning the Foundation Company full consent
and an assignment to press on was sent you on 29.X. Steps
should be taken to arrange for a much speedier exchange of
telegrams between us: the apparatus of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade is generally rather had.

Secret

Comrade Kamenev:

I think Chicherin is wrong. The condition we must lay
down is that the grain should go only to our starving peasants;
we have to accept. We in the C.P.C. decided on 5/XI to give
gold only for 9 million poods
(33 — 15 = 18. 18 : 2 == 9[2]).
We must try to help in every way, even if in exchange for
the British rubbish.

We shall make a provisional reservation on security.

7/XI. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter reporting that the British
famine relief committee intended to deliver to the Ukraine and
other areas goods for exchange for grain, so as to send the grain
obtained to the famine-stricken areas. Chicherin proposed that
the plan should be rejected, believing that the British would
supply old goods and mat there was danger of bandit attacks on
British shop assistants.





[2]
The figures are a calculation of the seed required for spring sowing
in the famine-stricken gubernias in the spring of 1922. The
necessary quantity was 33 million poods, of which 15 million poods
were to be supplied to the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture
by the People’s Commissariat for Food; to obtain one-half of the
remaining 18 million poods, that is, 9 million poods, the C.P.C.
allocated gold; the other 9 million poods were to be obtained by
the People’s Commissariat for Food through procurements aver
and above the plan.

10.XI.1921
Comrade N. P. Gorbunov

The industrial and office workers of the Bryansk Works
have made 7 electric ploughs. By 1.I.1922, they will make
20.

The difficulties involved were incredible.

That is why it is necessary to give a special reward to
some 70 industrial and office workers. This is certified by
Comrade Zheltov, director of the Bryansk Works.

Please raise this question in the C.L.D. tomorrow, after
discussing with Comrade Zheltov the types of reward (Order
of the Banner of Labour, cash or
kind).[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of remunerating the workers of the Bryansk Works
for their successful manufacture of electric ploughs was examined
by the C.L.D. on November 25, 1921. The C.L.D. resolved that
the case should be referred to the Central Committee of the
Metalworkers’ Union. In view of the fact that by November 1 the

   

Bryansk Works had made only 8 of the 20 electric ploughs planned,
the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union ruled that
there was no reason to issue any special rewards, adding that the
workers, who distinguished themselves, could be rewarded from the
resources allocated for the manufacture of the electric ploughs.
Having studied the conclusion 01 the Central Committee of the
Metalworkers’ Union, the C.L.D., on December 14, 1921, resolved
to accept it.

Comrade Radchenko:

This is a Party veteran.

Such men will be of undoubted use in combating
dishonest elements abroad.

He is riot a merchant but, according to people experienced

    

in commerce, will be of unquestionable benefit as an honest
man.

I request his
appointment.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Unschlicht, Deputy Chairman, All-Russia Cheka


Copy to the Narrow C.P.C.

I authorise you to call and chair a conference consisting
of the People’s Commissars for Foreign Trade, Internal
Affairs and Defence urgently to examine the problem of
combating smuggling.

Make your report to the Narrow C.P.C. within a
week.[1]

Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of combating smuggling was examined at several
Narrow C.P.C. sittings in November 1921.

On November 21, the C.P.C. approved a draft decree “On
Rewards for Detention of Smuggled Goods” (the decree was published
in Izvestia VTsIK on December 3, 1921). On November 23, the
Narrow C.P.C. discussed the measures for combating smuggling,
and on November 28, having adopted as a basis a draft C.P.C.
decree on combating smuggling introduced by the All-Russia
Cheka, it instructed the commission, within five days, “to carry
out an additional reworking of the draft and also work out a
statute of organs to combat smuggling” (Central Party Archives).
The draft decision submitted by tie commission was adopted
with amendments by the Narrow C.P.C. on December 8 (the
decision was published in Izvestia VTsIK on December 29, 1921).

12.XI.1921

Comrade Gorbunov:

Please read the enclosure and send on to Comrade Alsky
for a study by him and members of the People’s
Commissariat for Finance Collegium, and then on to Comrade
Kamenev, chairman of a commission which will probably
deal with the matter as
well.[1]

I first met Chebotaryov in the 1880s, in the case of my
elder brother, Alexander Ilyich Ulyanov, who was hanged
in 1887. Chebotaryov is undoubtedly an honest man. In the
epoch of the first revolution and after he was politically a
Cadet, but not an active one. I believe that his honesty
can and must be relied upon. He now seems to be
politically close to Smena
Vekh.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to a report from I. N. Chebotaryov, a member of
the Governing Committee of the State Savings Banks before the
October Revolution, addressed to the Chairman of the Council
of People’s Commissars on November 7, 1921. Chebotaryov said
there was need to reopen the state savings banks in order to
attract money in the hands of the population.

The savings banks wore established by a C.P.C. decision of
December 26, 1922 (published in Izvestia VTsIK, December 29,
1922).




[2]
Smena Vekh (Change of Landmarks)—a weekly journal published
in Paris from October 1921 to March 1922 by a group of
whiteguard émigré intellectuals, which also issued a collection entitled
Smena Vekh in Prague in July 1921. The Smena Vekh trend was
named after the collection and the journal. Realising that it was
quite hopeless to overthrow the Soviet power through foreign armed

   

intervention, the Smena Vekh followers came out in favour of
co-operation with the Soviet power in the hope of its degeneration
into a bourgeois state. Some of them were honestly desirous
of promoting Russia’s economic rehabilitation.

Comrade Molotov:

What is the state of this matter?

I think §§ 4 and 5 are harmful.

Please, return this to me with a comment in a couple
of words.

19.XI.1921

Comrade Molotov:

I am taking the matter on to the Politbureau.

It is altogether wrong to decide such matters in the
Orgbureau: this is a purely political, an entirely political
question.
 

And it calls for a different solution.


Please have the secretary type out the old and the new
version on one page.

(1) I think § 4 should be deleted.

(2) —the legal responsibility of Communists should be
enhanced.

(3) the Party Committee’s “opinions” should be allowed
only with dispatch to the centre and verification by the
Central Control Commission.

Lenin

First published in 1959 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI

Notes
 
 



[1]
The first note was written in connection with a protest by the
People’s Commissariat for Justice against the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
circular of June 16, 1921, on the relationships between the Party
and the judicial and investigation organs, which gave
Communists judicial immunity without the sanction of the local Party
Committees.

The People’s Commissariat for Justice asked that §§ 4 and 5
should be deleted from the C.C. circular.

§ 4 put the duty on the judicial authorities to release
Communists up for trial under the personal warranty of individuals
delegated by Party Committees. § 5 put the duty on the Party
Committee to study the case within three days and to have an
opinion on the substance of the case, so that the committee’s
decision would be a Party directive for the court and would
predetermine the judicial decision.

In reply to his first note, Lenin received the C.C. Orgbureau
decision of November 11, 1921, approving the circular, and
V. M. Molotov’s letter saying that the circular was modified
and that the question could be considered settled.

Since these changes did not affect the main shortcoming of the
circular, Lenin wrote another note.

In early January 1922, the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee
published a circular “On the Relationships Between Party
Committees and Judicial and Investigation Commissions” which
cancelled the June 16 circular. The new circular emphasised the
imperative need to enhance the responsibility of Party members
in the event of their committing any offences falling under the
jurisdiction of the civil court or the Revolutionary Tribunal (see
Spravochnik partrabotnika, Part II, 1922, p. 177).

15/XI.

Comrade Lunacharsky:

I should very much like to fulfil Comrade Zinoviev’s
request and scold
Serrati.[1]

Could you help me?

You could help in two ways:

1) let me have the manuscript of your pamphlet (16.XI,
did you say? or later,
retyped?),[2]

2) let me have two or three original documents in
Italian, the better to “brace” me up. Let’s have the most
eloquent documents.

Incidentally, Serrati appeared to have asked Lazzari:
“Have you been swindled?” “Who is the swindler?” Do you
happen to have the original of this question?

P.S. Return the enclosure.

Regards,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

G. Y. Zinoviev asked Lenin to write an article or a letter against    

the Italian reformists and Serrati’s double-dealing behaviour,        


   

believing this to be of groat importance. See also this volume,    

Document 569.

A reference to A. V. Lunacharsky’s pamphlet which he was then                 

writing on Lenin’s proposal (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian)    

Edition, Vol. 53, Document 518). The pamphlet was published                   

in Petrograd in 1922 under the title Citizen Giacinto Serrati, or         

a Revolutionary-Opportunist Amphibian.

Comrade Samarin:

I have been informed by absolutely honest people who
have been to the Crimea that everyone there is stealing
wine. They say the situation is utterly scandalous, there is
bribe-taking and hard drinking. You are responsible for a
full and impartial check-up. By the way; the controversial
issue between the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade
and the People’s Commissariat for Public Health about
whether wine should be sold abroad (I think that this should
be done and fast) or left for the hospitals. You must
collect all the facts on this question quickly. If there is
anything urgent, cable me directly. I shall expect very short
dispatches weekly.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

Comrade Unschlicht:

Since permission was issued to go to America—this
means there are no obstacles, are there? Please give
instructions (and appoint a responsible person: secretary) to issue
at once, without the slightest delay or any
formalities.[1]

Written on a letter from the People’s Commissar for Education,
A. V. Lunacharsky, reporting that Academician I. P. Pavlov
had refused to go to America and wanted to spend a month in
Finland. However, Lunacharsky wrote, although there was a
decision giving Pavlov permission to go to America, and to issue
the money he needed, he was unable to obtain a visa for a trip
to Finland.

I. S. Unschlicht informed Lenin that on November 15 he had
issued instructions that I. P. Pavlov was to be given a visa for
a trip to Finland without any formalities. On Unschlicht’s note
there is the following instruction by Lenin to his secretary: “Phone
Semashko. Please check up fulfilment. Lenin” (Lenin
Miscellany XXIII, p. 329).

Written on a report from L. K. Martens saying that the first
shipload of wheat for Russia, under an agreement with the Allied
Drug and Chemical Corporation, was to leave New York on
November 17, 1921.

The agreement between the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Trade and this corporation on the delivery to Soviet Russia of
one million poods of wheat was concluded in Moscow on
October 27, and approved by the C.L.D. on November 4, 1921 (see this
volume, Documents 439, 441, 451, 473, 474, 482 and also
Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 53, Documents 428
and 511).

On November 25, 1921, the C.L.D. instructed the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the People’s Commissariat
for Railways to submit a report on the measures necessary for
the “acceptance of grain without any delays” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

19.XI.1921

To Comrades Stomonyakov, Lutovinov,
 Krasin, Vorovsky, Kerzhentsev, Lomonosov,
 Litvinov, and others

I strongly recommend the bearer, Comrade Nikolai
Alexandrovich Yemelyanov. I have known him personally
since July 1917, as one of the best among the old Party
guard in Petrograd. I request that you show him full trust
and give him every assistance. I believe that it is
highly important to bring him into closer touch with the
affairs of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade,
because, first, we are short of experienced Party men
among the P.C.F.T. personnel abroad. Second, I have
a number of documents saying that workers abroad often
resent the fact that the P.C.F.T. of the R.S.F.S.R. has
not sought ways of drawing closer to
them.[1]

In this
context, Yemelyanov’s role should also be very big.

It is my earnest request that those of you who meet
Comrade Yemelyanov should write to me.

With communist greetings,


V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

19.XI.1921

Comrade Kursky:

Krasin very much fears that Goikhbarg has made a hash
of the records of Groman’s commission (amount of our
losses from the intervention).

Comrade Goikhbarg appears to be ill.

That is why a thorough check-up must be made:

(1) whether the records have been well preserved?

(2) what is their result?

(3) who is responsible for their integrity and
safekeeping?

(4) is any additional work required?

(5) to whom should this be assigned?

Please, check up personally and reply to me without
delay.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On November 21, 1921, D. I. Kursky informed Lenin that the
materials of the commission to estimate the losses had been
preserved, that they were at the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs and were being completed by a commission set up by a
C.P.C. decision of November 1, 1921. Kursky proposed a C.P.C.
decision to appoint S. S. Pilyavsky to be responsible for safe-

   

keeping the material and to fix December 1, 1921, as a deadline
for completing the work of the commission.

On Kursky’s letter there is the following note by Lenin: “To
Gorbunov. Introduce tomorrow, 22/XI, in the C.P.C. 21/XI.
Lenin.”

On November 22, the C.P.C. heard Kursky’s report and
accepted his proposal. See also this volume, Document 512.

19.XI.1921   

Comrade Molotov:

Today Comrade Teodorovich brought in his resignation.
I refused to accept it.

It, is plain that he wishes to clear himself of the odium
of any possible conflicts and friction with Osinsky.

I am sure, however, that the matter will be settled
for the greater benefit of the People’s Commissariat.

Please circulate this among Politbureau members to find
out whether they confirm my refusal to accept  Teodorovich’s
resignation.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter here published is connected with the conflict at the
People’s Commissariat for Agriculture between V. V.
Obolensky (N. Osinsky) and I. A. Teodorovich. Having discussed this
question on November 18, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee adopted the following decision:

“a) To recognise that for the correct direction of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture it is necessary to carry out the
following combination in the top posts: the political-administrative
direction should be in the hands of Comrade Osinsky, the People’s
Commissar should be a peasant engaged in practical work in
agriculture, and Comrade Osinsky’s deputy should be Comrade
Teodorovich. =

b) To leave Comrade Teodorovich as head of the
animal husbandry department” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On November 21, the Politbureau reaffirmed its decision
concerning Teodorovich.

On November 22, Osinsky asked the Politbureau either to cancel
its decision on Teodorovich or to accept his resignation as Deputy
People’s Commissar. On this letter, Lenin wrote: “I propose that
we reject both parts. Lenin.” Lenin’s proposal was adopted by
the Politbureau on November 29, 1921. See also this volume,
Documents 546 and 547.

19.XI.1921

Comrade Gorbunov:

It is absolutely wrong on your part to put before me
such an important paper on 17/XI (!!) with such an empty
note.

It should have been brought before the C.L.D.!

You are responsible if a mistake has been made because
of Avanesov’s departure and if neither you nor Smolyaninov
had made timely contact either with Ivan Nikitich Smirnov
(which is easily done: he is in Petrograd) or with
Chutskayev. It is your fault.

Why is it that some Krasinsky is hustling, while
Smolyaninov and you are doing
nothing?[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to a letter sent to Lenin by G. D. Krasinsky, special
agent of the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection for Siberia and the Urals, on December 16, 1921,
arguing that the C.L.D. decision of November 11 was not
appropriate. It was a decision to transfer for temporary exploitation
an unfinished railway line between Kolchugino and the
Prokopyevsk mines from the Siberian Public Works Committee to the
People’s Commissariat for Railways.

That same day, November 21, the C.L.D. reaffirmed its
decision and instructed N. P. Gorbunov to “send the Siberian
Revolutionary Committee and the Siberian Railway District a direct
wire notification that the C.L.D. decision of 11/XI should be
implemented at once” (Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee). See

Comrade Stalin:

Will you let me have a copy of your reply to Chicherin?
I think he is
right.[1]

20/XI. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written under the text of G. V. Chicherin’s letter to J. V. Stalin
of November 19, 1921, in which Chicherin said that the
Soviet state should not confine itself to giving political support

   

to the national liberation movement in the East, but should
help the young national states to develop their economy and
train their personnel. Pointing to the positive results of this
policy in respect of Afghanistan, Mongolia and Persia, Chicherin
suggested the same policy in respect of Turkey.

21.XI.1921

Comrade Molotov


Comrade Rakovsky


Comrade “Semyon” (Schwarz) of the All-Russia
Miners’ Union C.C.

    


Comrade Pyatakov


{{ in Donbas }}


Comrade Rukhimovich 

Dear Comrade:

I enclose Comrade Remeiko’s
pamphlet.[1]

You need only run your eye over a page and a half (13
and 14) to see the gist of the matter: struggle and
squabbling in Donbas.

To the conflicts and disagreements between Pyatakov and
Rukhimovich are added the disagreements between Remeiko
(and the comrades he names on p. 14) and Pyatakov and
Kalnin.

These discords and dissensions in Donbas, which is our
fortress, are highly dangerous.

Please, have a look through the pamphlet (or the two
pages, 13 and 14, which is quite enough) and write me at
least a couple of words on the measures which could (and
should) be taken to eliminate discords and frictions  in
Donbas.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to a pamphlet by Y. Remeiko, a member of the
Presidium of the C.C. of the Mineworkers’ Union, entitled Decisions
of the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P., the Trade Union and the
Donbas Workers (Report). MS, published in Moscow in November
1921.





[2]
The differences between executives in Donbas were discussed
at several sittings of the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee.

On November 26 and 27, 1921, the Politbureau outlined a
number of measures to ensure normal relations between and
efficient work by executives in Donbas.

On December 22, 1921, the Politbureau approved the decision
by the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
of the Ukraine, dismissing Pyatakov from the post of Chairman
of the Central Board of the Coal-Mining Industry, and
appointing V. Y. Chubar instead. The Politbureau’s decision was
confirmed by a plenary meeting of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee
on December 28, 1921.

Lenin spoke of the differences in Donbas in his political report
of the C.C. to the Eleventh Congress of the Party (see present
edition, Vol. 33, pp. 296–99).

I have known Comrade Hanecki since 1903, when he was
a representative of the Polish Social-Democrats at our Party
Congress. I later knew him all the time as a member of the
Polish C.C. I had an opportunity of watching him work at
close range in 1912–1914, when we lived together in Cracow.
From there Comrade Hanecki repeatedly travelled for
underground work in Poland, carrying out C.C. assignments
both abroad and in Russia. I fully recommend him for the
Party.

The reference was written in connection with a purge of the    

R.C.P.(B.) in 1921.

It was written on the autobiography of J. S. Hanecki, and

This is highly suspicious!

Comrade Unschlicht must appoint a perfectly reliable
man, whom he knows personally, to carry out a check-up.
This is ingenious robbery. Perhaps this is being done
everywhere?

Notes
 
 



[1]
In its letter, the Moscow Production Administration asked
Mostextil (the Moscow Committee of the Textile Industry) to slop
issuing indents for the removal of raw materials, components
and goods from the textile mills, and also to suspend the indents
issued earlier, pending clarification of the circumstances of the
lease of these mills to an initiative group of lessees. This
measure was caused by the fact that the lease of these mills had been
effected virtually without control and had resulted in the
stealing of state property with impunity. See this volume, Document
514.

22.XI.1921

Comrade Stalin and Comrade Unschlicht:

I was handed the enclosed by Comrade
Kiselyov.[1] This
is the scandalous way we handle our leases.

The inventory is fictitious, like this one. Or there is
none at all.

A host of the most valuable goods—fabrics, machines,
belts, etc., etc.—is being stolen by the lessees, and by
the reception and delivery men. I wrote about this to
Unschlicht before.

Perhaps we should call some highly reliable men for a
secret conference on measures of combating this?

(a) Detection of several cases and shooting;

(b) working out of additional instructions;

(c) ditto—measures of  verification

etc.[2]

23.XI.1921

L. B. Kamenev


Copy to Comrade Khinchuk

Yesterday the C.P.C. referred to your commission the
question of an agreement with
Steinberg.[1] In Izvestia
    

today, Gorsky has estimated that Steinberg will make
194,000 million Soviet rubles on 100,000 kilograms of
saccharin (this will cost him 600,000 rubles a kilogram, i.e.,
all the 100,000 kilograms will cost him 60,000 million =
60 milliard; this means the percentage of profit 194 : 60==
323 per cent).

If Gorsky’s estimate is right, this is a vast profit. I think
the R.S.F.S.R. has a share of super-profits, reckoning
superprofits as over and above 250 per cent?

Perhaps we could 

(1) drive a bargain so as to have a special share of the
super-profits, reckoning super-profits at 100 or 200 per cent?

(2) secure by special arrangement the possibility to train
our own men (especially in Centrosoyuz) in the methods
and organisation of trade?

(3) specifically assure ourselves of the possibility of
cancelling the agreement earlier, as soon as we fools have
learned enough from the clever people.

I think that after driving a hard bargain and checking
everything over and over again, we should conclude the
agreement, because fools must pay a high price for being
taught.

Let’s have your opinion.

Lenin

Please raise these questions in the State Planning
Commission:

1. acceleration of construction and starting of the
Ivanovo-Voznesensk district electric-power station (on Lake
Rubskoye) and

2. inclusion in the Central Peat Administration programme
for 1922 of the working of the Rubskoye peat bogs or
transfer of their working to the power-station project.

On the strength of the available material resources, it is
necessary right away to establish and approve a programme

    

for construction and peat bog working for the
Ivanovo-Voznesensk station, and their priority, for 1922.

I think it is desirable to secure participation in the
discussion of this matter, apart from the central departments
concerned (Commission for Utilisation, Public Works
Committee, and Central Peat Administration), a representative
of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk gubernia economic conference
and the chief engineer of the construction
project.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.

In general, we should hurry up with the working out of
a plan for state electric-power construction for 1922 so as
to have it ready for the Congress of
Soviets.[2]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In its reply letter of December 15, 1921, the State Planning
Commission wrote that its Presidium had heard a representative of
the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia Executive Committee about
the progress of construction at the Ivanovo-Voznesensk District
Power Station. Gosplan’s conclusion said that there were not
enough data to decide on the urgency of the project and that its
work was not covered by the extraction of peat in the Teikovo
bog, where the station was to be sited. In view of this, Gosplan
asked the Central Board for the Peat Industry (Tsutorf) to take
urgent steps to intensify the extraction of peat, and the
Ivanovo-Voznesensk economic conference to work out, in order to set the
exact date for commissioning the electric-power station, a scheme
for developing and restructuring industry and other branches of
the economy from the standpoint of the requirements in electric
power and fuel. See also this volume, Document 666.

The construction of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Electric-Power
Station was started in 1926.

Comrade Molotov:

I am sending you this for the information of the
Politbureau members.

Please, put this on the agenda.

23/XI. Lenin 

My reply:

Comrade Okulov:

I am very sorry that I cannot send the recommendation
you request. I should very much like to do this if it entailed
only a personal recommendation. But that is not what
is involved. This is a political matter, and I am sending
it on to the
Politbureau.[1]

23/XI.

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The note to V. M. Molotov and the reply to A. I. Okulov were
written by Lenin on Okulov’s letter. Okulov wrote to Lenin that
he had applied to the State Publishers for a permission to publish,
on his personal responsibility, a weekly scientific and literary
newspaper, and asked Lenin to give him a reference.

On January 17, 1922, the Politbureau decided: “To permit
Okulov to publish a weekly journal in accordance with the
programme he initially submitted” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

26.XI.1921

Copy to Comrade N. P. Gorbunov

It turns out once again that visitors coming to see me
are being detained by the
guards.[1]


Today, Comrade Sokolnikov, a member of the All-Russia
C.E.C., was detained for about 10 minutes as he was coming
to see me.

The guard was apparently right when he did not let
Sokolnikov use the phone, because, they say, it was a “house
phone”. But there is said to be another telephone, and the
guard should have let him use that! At any rate, I have
repeatedly demanded of the Kremlin Commandant, and
insist, that he should make arrangements under which
people coming to see me, even if they have no passes at all,
should have the possibility to phone through, without the
slightest delay, both from the Kremlin gates and from
the C.P.C. entrance, to my secretariat and the telephone
operators of the second-floor exchange.

I hereby reprove you for neglecting my demands. Once
again I propose that you should make all the necessary
arrangements right away, installing, in case of need, two
additional telephones for visitors (one in the Kremlin gates,
and one at the C.P.C. entrance) and reply to me at once.
Work out special instructions for those coming to see
me.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

G. M.! 

What’s this I see in Pravda today about Cheiko’s
invention?[1] Is this another canard? If this is in earnest, why

    

print anything about remote-controlled explosions? Write
me a couple of words; perhaps we should send an inquiry
to Kharkov, or summon Cheiko, or have some specialist
phone Kharkov?

Yours,

Lenin

26/XI.

G. M.:

I have spoken with Chubar. It turns out that he knows
about this invention and says that the specialists and
professors over there have discussed it and found it to be a
serious one. He says he can send over the materials and
the inventor himself.

We have to decide whether we should get the materials
or the inventor himself over here; perhaps we should send
them to Bonch-Bruyevich in
Nizhni-Novgorod?[2]

Think about this and write me or N. P. Gorbunov, to
whom I shall give an assignment to keep an eye on the
execution and verification.

Yours,

Lenin

that electrical engineer I. A. Cheiko of Kharkov had discovered      

“new rays” emanating from a magnetic field, whose thermal          

effect made it possible to explode mines, artillery depots, etc.,    

by remote control. These rays, the author said, could also be        

used in mining and the chemical industry, geodesy, medicine,         

etc. See this volume, Documents 520 and 543.

Comrade Kamenev:

My view is closer to yours than to Dzerzhinsky’s. I
advise you not to give in and to take it to the Politbureau.
Then we shall secure the maximum of maximums. We shall
also impose on the People’s Commissariat for Justice
responsibility for failing to inform the Politbureau (or the
C.P.C.) about the All-Russia Cheka’s defects  and
irregularities.[1]

29/XI. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written in connection with the working out of a new
statute of the All-Russia Cheka under the New Economic Policy.

Having sent Lenin the basic provisions drawn up by the
Collegium of the All-Russia Cheka, with which the People’s
Commissar for Justice D. I. Kursky had agreed, and a draft statute
of the All-Russia Cheka (substituting the existing decisions on
the All-Russia Cheka and its local organs) to be submitted for
approval by the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C., and other
material, Kamenev wrote: “Have a look at this. This is the
maximum Dzerzhinsky will agree to, and that which Kursky is,
of course, satisfied with. I insist on this maximum: =

1. Unburden
the Cheka, leaving political crimes, espionage, banditism and
the protection of railways and warehouses in its charge. Not more.
The rest—to the People’s Commissariat for Justice. =

2. The
Cheka’s investigation apparatus to be merged with the People’s
Commissariat for Justice, handing it over to the revolutionary
tribunals.”

The Collegium of the All-Russia Cheka objected to the
“transfer to the various organs of inquiry and investigation”, and
considered it “premature to separate from each other (to transfer
to various organs) political cases and cases involving
large-scale stealing of the public property and official misconduct”
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On December 1, 1921, Lenin introduced in the Politbureau
of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. a proposal to reform the All-Russia Cheka,
narrowing down the scope of its activity (see present edition,
Vol. 42, pp. 366–67). Having adopted Lenin’s proposal, the

   

Politbureau set up a commission, consisting of L. B. Kamenev,
D. I. Kursky and F. E. Dzerzhinsky, to discuss the matter
within five days, on the strength of the adopted decision.

Comrade Trotsky:

Please, take the enclosed into consideration, and return
to me (together with this note)—I shall send it to a
few other
people.[1]

Ad 1. What is there to be “cautious” about?? There is
nothing at all in practice, nothing but talks. Unfortunately,
the Germans are excessively “cautious”. Here Chicherin is
wrong.

Ad No. 3... I think that is a piece of gossip. We should
face Hartwig (and the other Ger--\thinspace-mans) with this flat and
precise question: what is it you want of us? a treaty without
Britain? Very well, then! Let’s have a draft as soon as
possible and we shall sign it.

Until now, the Germans have come forward with nothing
but words.

For the sake of diplomacy, Krasin had to avoid showing
his cards to Stinnes, and even had to be amiable with him.

30/XI. Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to G. V. Chicherin’s letter, who, with the
economic negotiations with Germany in mind, wrote: “I would

No. 1
??

recommend very great caution in respect of the proposed
grand German prospects” (the underlinings and remarks
hero and below are Lenin’s). Chicherin went on to describe
the improvement of relations with Poland (here Lenin put
“2” in the margin, but did not deal with this question in his
letter). Returning to the negotiations with Germany,
Chicherin continued: “What Hartwig said made it clear that Krasin
in Berlin supported the Stinnes line of trustification with

|| ?

Britain for work in Russia, that he held himself very close
to Stinnes, and even agreed with him about his trip to
Britain. Over here in talks with us Krasin kept yessing us and
agreeing with the opposite line—supporting in
every way the

||| ? ?

tendency in Germany for separate work (without Britain) in
Russia. While abroad he was doing the opposite!”

No. 3

Comrade Metelev,


Superintendent of All-Russia C.E.C. Houses

Please be sure to make available a room in the 1st House
of Soviets to Comrade Cecilia Samoilovna Bobrovskaya,
whom I know very well as an old Party worker. She is
now living in absolutely intolerable conditions, and the
doctors have ordered her to be transferred at once to one
of the Houses of Soviets.

Inform my secretariat of
execution.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

P.S. I have known Bobrovskaya since the epoch before
1905, and know that she is capable of living in great
hardship and be reticent about it excessively. That is why she
needs urgent
help.[1]

 

Notes

P.S. is in Lenin’s hand.—Ed.

On December 1, 1921, A. D. Metelev informed Lenin that          

Cecilia Bobrovskaya had been given a room at the First House

30/XI.

Comrade Belov:

I agree with you on the idea.

Give this thing a push in practice, i.e., draft a decision
(perhaps it is better this way: first, select the personnel,
and then write a draft decision).

I think there is no need to leave the Party. I object.

You should remain in the Department Store and get things
running on model
lines.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

P.S. Concerning release from the Narrow Council, get
Kiselyov’s opinion.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Apparently written in connection with the question of giving
the State Department Store (GUM) permission to work
together with foreign capitalists in export-import trade, and to set
up a joint-stock company for that purpose.

GUM was set up by a Narrow C.P.C. decision of October 3,
1921, on organising an inter-ministerial department store.

G. M.:

I have had a call from Kritsman.

I enclose his notes and mine on his plan.

Please read them and return with a couple of words of
comment.

I am worried (especially) about two aspects of the matter: 
 

(1) Is it possible to transfer the Commission for
Utilisation to the State Planning Commission otherwise than as a
w ho /e?

if not, is it possible to reduce its staffs in transferring
it as a whole?

(2) shall we not in fact leave the People’s
Commissariats without control if the Commission for Utilisation is
transferred to the State Planning Commission?

(what are the measures against this? what are the
guarantees against this? This backing by the
departments of the plan to transfer the Commission for
Utilisation to the State Planning Commission, is it
perhaps self-seeking in the worst sense?)

30/XI. Lenin

One other thing: is it possible not to combine (in one
way or another) the distribution of foodstuffs with the
distribution of
bank-notes?[1]

Members of the Politbureau

2/XII.

Having now fully read the platform “We Are Collectivists”
(Vperyod-ites, Bogdanov-ites, Proletcult people,
etc.),[1]
I have finally come to the conclusion that it would be
unquestionably useful for us and necessary to print it as
a pamphlet in 2,000–3,000 copies, with the most
circumstantial critique, with an addition of an article on
Bogdanov’s political statements in 1917, etc.

I propose that a number of authors should be asked to
write a pamphlet under the editorship of Bukharin, who
should be authorised to share it out between the authors,
obtain their manuscripts within two weeks and show the
Politbureau in proof, (This is also necessary for foreign
countries.)

1) C.C. circulars about Proletcults.
 

2) “We Are Collectivists”.

3) Bukharin’s article from Pravda.

4) A few more articles analysing the platform.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This platform was an anonymous document expressing the views
of some intellectuals, and was issued for the Second All-Russia
Proletcult Congress held in Moscow in November 1921. They cast
doubt on the socialist character of the October Revolution and
came out against the policy of the Communist Party and the
Soviet Government; in philosophy they stood up for Machist and
Bogdanovite “theories”, and in politics adopted the views of
the opportunist Workers’ Opposition. The communist group

   

of the Second Proletcult Congress condemned the “collectivist”
platform, and dissociated itself from it.

Proletcult (Proletarian Culture Organisation) was set up in
September 1917 as an independent workers’ organisation.
Proletcult, whose direction was in the hands of A. Bogdanov and
his supporters, continued, even after the October Revolution,
to maintain its “independence”, thereby setting itself up in
opposition to the Communist Party and the proletarian state. It
was not a homogeneous organisation: alongside bourgeois
intellectuals, who dominated many of its organisations, there were
young workers who were sincerely desirous of taking part in
cultural construction. In a number of his works, Lenin sharply
criticised Proletcult’s erroneous views. Proletcult organisations were
most widespread in 1919, but declined in the early 1920s and were
dissolved in 1932.

Lenin’s proposal for a pamphlet exposing the “collectivist”
platform was adopted by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
on December 3, 1921.

The “C.C. circulars” mentioned in the text are the R.C.P.(B.)
C.C. letter “On the Proletcults” (see Pravda No. 270, December
1, 1920) and the Politbureau’s decision on the Proletcults of
November 22, 1921, published in Izvestia R.C.P.(B.) C.C. No. 38
for 1921.

Comrades Yenukidze, Karpinsky, Dzerzhinsky, Zalutsky,
Mikhailov and Molotov

Dear Comrade:

It has become clear from the C.P.C. office practice
in dealing with complaints and applications that in
specially serious and urgent cases it helps to use
“personal contacts”, i.e., personal communication with various
Party comrades holding sufficiently influential positions
in the localities. This serves to reduce the delays which
are inevitable in the usual departmental routing of
business, and generally enhances the required effect.

An example is provided by the case of terrorism by the
kulak “lair” in the (new) Yelan Uyezd of Saratov
Gubernia, which had made up to the Soviet power and the Party.
Within 10 days we obtained a reply telegram from the
plenipotentiary All-Russia Cheka representative in the Volga
area saying that “all measures to detect the guilty have

    

been taken”, when the inquiry was sent in this “comradely”
manner. There are similar results in other cases.

But this method can be applied more extensively only
where there is sufficient knowledge of the responsible
functionaries actually on the spot. Our request is, therefore,
urgently to draw up and send to the C.P.C. office
at 4 Vozdvizhenka, appropriate lists of reliable comrades
with a good record, from among members of Executive
Committees, Gubernia Cheka, etc., one or two per gubernia,
who, you believe, are especially suitable for applying such
“pressure”.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

P. S. There is need for the fullest guarantee that such
comrades are honest, namely: give in the greatest possible
detail their Party and Soviet government record, and a
personal warranty of their absolute honesty by several
Party veterans.

3/XII.–21

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

“Please designate the men who could be used for ‘personal
contacts’ in the event of need in more serious and thorough
investigation.”

An entry on January 4, 1922, says: “N. P. Gorbunov is dealing
with it. Everything is going well. The men are being designated”
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of
the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

3/XII.

Dear Alexei Ivanovich:

So the decision on your trip has been taken. It has been
passed through the
Politbureau.[1] You will have to
remain until the second operation and full recovery. I have
seen Tsyurupa and have his opinion—an excellent one—
about treatment by the Germans. I have no doubt that you
will be fully cured (I saw a doctor’s report about you)
provided you display just a bit of patience. ————
I am sending you the decision on Tsyurupa and my outline
of a plan for the organisation of his work and
yours.[2]

The first and second deputies, as you will see from the
plan, will have to break new ground. We have decided,

    

for the time being, until your return and the experiment
with Tsyurupa, that this plan is not to be turned into a
decision. We shall first try it out and check it in practice.
Let me know what you think.

Good-bye for the time being, and take your treatment
seriously.

Yours,

Lenin

I am very sorry that my request to inform me about the
case of Comrade Shapiro’s expulsion from the Party has
caused the cancellation of the examination of his case by
the Moscow Gubernia Commission scheduled for 18.00
hours today, December 3. This is a result of a
misunderstanding and mistake, because the most important thing, of
course, is the speedy examination of the case.

On the substance of the case, I apply to the Moscow
Gubernia Commission for Checking and Purging the Party
to take into account the following of my considerations.

1) Over a period of several years I have repeatedly heard
from N. K. Krupskaya that Shapiro was an exceptionally
honest worker, but was not liked for his stringent demands.
That is why when the purging began I warned N. K.
Krupskaya that attention should be paid to a possible and
probable intrigue connected with this.

2) My article in the press that the Mensheviks and the
Bundists who joined the R.C.P. were unreliable was
frequently taken to mean that they should all be
expelled.[1]

I feel it to be my duty, therefore, to state that I have
always considered that each case must be dealt with
individually, and in confirmation refer, for instance, to the

    

former Menshevik Chirkin, who joined the R.C.P. much
later than Shapiro, and about whose wavering we had
precise facts, and not just rumour or hearsay. Still, after
an all-round examination of Chirkin’s case, I agreed with
the Ukrainian comrades who were defending him, that
Chirkin should be left in the Party.

3) Shapiro’s application has Comrade A. Yenukidze’s
inscription of 3.IX.1921, saying: “I fully certify everything
set out here by Comrade Shapiro for the 1917 period.”

And what Comrade Shapiro has stated about this period
is of exceptional importance, because the meaning of it
is that the Menshevik Shapiro had started to oppose the
Mensheviks even before the October Revolution.

In reply to my special inquiry about Shapiro addressed
to Comrade Yenukidze the latter told me today that he
had worked with him on the front-line commission of the
old, Menshevik All-Russia C.E.C., from April to August
1917. Having been in close contact with Comrade Shapiro
in that period, Comrade Yenukidze told me that he had
absolutely no doubt about Comrade Shapiro’s sincerity,
and that he, Yenukidze, would certainly be in favour of
leaving Comrade Shapiro in the Party.

Comrade Yenukidze gave me this additional
characteristic fact: after the July 1917 days, when the
Bolsheviks were being fiercely harassed, Shapiro put up such a
defence of the Bolsheviks at the meeting, that Vainstein, a
member of the Menshevik C.C., all but used his fists against
Shapiro.

Let me add that Comrade Yenukidze, a Party member
since 1898, is one of the old Party guard, who in fact
should check and purge our Party. I believe that any
evidence coming from the ranks of this old guard deserves
triple attention. I feel therefore that it is quite wrong for
the district commission to expel Comrade Shapiro without
summoning Comrade Yenukidze. It is my request to the
Moscow Gubernia Commission to summon Comrade
Yenukidze, Secretary of the All-Russia C.E.C., in Shapiro’s case.

4) Comrade Shapiro’s application says that he is the
author of a pamphlet on the agrarian question issued in
1907, under the pseudonym of M. Shanin. As Comrade
Shapiro has said, I analysed this pamphlet in my book,

    

The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in the First
Russian Revolution 1905–1907 (2nd ed., Petrograd, 1919,
p. 84
et seq.).[2]

While criticising Shanin for a number of
Menshevik errors, I noted even at the time, over 10 years
ago, that he differed from the Mensheviks. For instance,
on p. 85 of the said book, I noted that Shanin “prompted,
of course, by the very best motives, defends confiscation
against redemption
payments”.[3]


This is a very essential fact, indicating that more than
ten years ago, Comrade Shapiro had had a tendency to
move away from the Mensheviks to the revolutionary side.

5) My fears that the purging of the Party could provide
some people with a pretext for an intrigue against Comrade
Shapiro—fears about which I told N. K. Krupskaya long
before the start of the purging in the city of Moscow—have
been borne out by the following circumstance. The District
Commission has expelled Shapiro without summoning
Yenukidze, without naming anyone who knows Shapiro well
at his work, and who could cite facts about his
unreliability. The commission has called Shapiro “unstable and
wavering”, without offering the least proof, without the
slightest concrete indication. One cannot help thinking
that someone’s far from impartial reference (from among
his fellow workers, for instance) to the effect, let us say,
that he is “not one of us”, that he is “alien” to us, could
very well have played a part.

Let us recall, however, that the Party cell at the
Chief Committee for Political Education unanimously came
out in favour of Shapiro (as I learned from Comrade
Anna Ivanovna Meshcheryakova, an old Party member,
whom I have known since the émigré period, and a member
of the cell who attended the meeting). Shapiro was in
charge of one of the six departments of the Chief Committee for
Political Education. Consequently, the persons subordinate to
him were in a small minority at the Party cell meeting.
No one could have had a closer view of Comrade Shapiro’s
day-to-day work than the cell of his establishment. If that
cell had unanimously come out for Shapiro, the weight

    

of such a vote should, I think, be regarded as very great.
I believe it is highly probable that Shapiro has become a
victim of an intrigue, rumour to the effect that he is “not
one of us”, without there being a shred of evidence, without
any direct statement by a single Party member, who has
had an occasion to observe Comrade Shapiro’s work at close
range.

On the strength of what I have stated, I request the
Moscow Gubernia Commission for Checking and Purging
the Party that it should summon Comrade Yenukidze,
take what I have said into consideration, and check up
on who precisely has spoken out against Shapiro, and
whether this is not an intrigue.

It is also my request to let me have a copy of the decision

Comrade Lezhava, P.C.F.T.


Comrade Alsky, P.C.F.


Comrade Bogdanov, S.E.C.


Comrade Litkens, P.C.E.


Comrade Voyevodin

In Moscow now is the Communist Comrade Caroti, an
agent of the Italian film producers, Cito-Cinema, with
whom our mission in Italy has been carrying on preliminary
talks about a concession on the filming and purchase of
films in Russia and the showing of these films in Italy.

The talks with Comrade Caroti could be based on the
draft contract which he has and which leaves much room
for any necessary changes.

According to a report from the representative of the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade in Italy, the
Cito-Cinema company is a solid Italian film-producing
enterprise which is financed by the Italian Bank of Discount
and about which there must be a reference at the Financial
and Accounting Department of the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade.

I consider this business extremely important and urgent,

You are hereby instructed to call at once a conference to
examine Comrade Caroti’s proposal, to look into the whole
matter and draw up a relevant decision by the Council of
Labour and Defence.

Comrade Voyevodin will arrange the conference and
report to the C.L.D. on Wednesday, December 7.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

5/XII.1921.

Dear Comrades,

I send you my book about the evolution of agriculture
in the United States.

I should be very much obliged if I could have the
opinion of Comrade Carr, if my book can be read by him with
the aid of an English or German translator.

I should like also to receive from Comrade Ballister,
if possible, official publications of the census 1920 (I have
analysed in my book two censuses: 1900 & 1910).

If any publisher would like to publish my book in
English in Un. States, I should like to write small preface.

Yours truly,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Ballister (Robert Minor) and John Carr (L. Cutterfeld),         

representatives of the Communist Party of the U.S.A. on the     

Executive Committee of the Comintern, were received by Lenin    

on December 3, 1921.

That same day, a C.P.C. secretary made the following entry             

of Lenin’s verbal inquiry in the card register of his assignments:     

“When is Comrade Manucharyants able to get for Vladimir Ilyich        

two copies of his book New Data on Capitalism in Agriculture       

(North American United States).” On December 5, the same card    

has this addition: “The books have been received and passed on        


   

to Vladimir Ilyich” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of    

Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

To Comrade Molotov with a request to circulate it among
all members of the Politbureau.

It is necessary (1) to find out who is “Kurzhnir”?

Could he be Kushner, the author of the pamphlet on
electrification?

(2) There is need to devote more attention to
Myasnikov’s agitation, and report about him and about it to the
Politbureau twice a month.

(3) The Politbureau should have a special discussion on
how to respond to this
letter.[1]

Written on a copy of G. I. Myasnikov’s letter to engineer
B. A. Kurzhner, a Party member in Petrograd, in which
Myasnikov proposed to intensify, in connection with the forthcoming
Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.), subversive activity against
the Party’s policy.

The Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee discussed
G. I. Myasnikov’s case at several of its sittings, and on February
20, 1922, approved the proposal of a Politbureau commission
to expel him from the Party for gross breach of Party discipline
and anti-Party activity.

5.XII.1921

Comrade Molotov:

Orlov (the author of an excellent book about the food
supply work of the People’s Commissariat for Food) has
addressed an unusual request to the C.C.

I am in favour.

Tsyurupa (who knows Orlov personally; I know him by
his book) is also in favour.

We must poll the Politbureau members.

If they do not object, we must cable Krestinsky: “C.C.
approved Orlov’s plans about his
book.”[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

N. A. Orlov, author of the book Prodovolstvennaya rabota
sovetskoi vlasti (The Soviet Power’s Food Supply Work) (1918), was
in charge of the economic department of the journal Novy Mir,
which was published by the Soviet embassy in Berlin. Orlov
requested permission to write a book, Economic History of Soviet
Russia (Research Essay), and to publish it abroad under a
penname in several foreign languages. He believed it was better to
have the book written not from an openly communist standpoint,
but in the tone of an objectively minded non-Party researcher,
taking a favourable view of the Soviet power. For, argued
Orlov, writing in “a clearly apologetic vein ... fails to produce
the desired impression” (Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Lenin’s proposal was adopted by the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on December 7, 1921.

Comrade Lezhava:

A few days ago I saw in one of the papers (it may have
even been Pravda) an item about the turnover of the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade (in the Crimea)
involving 20 million rubles in
gold.[1]

Where does this come from?

Have you an arrangement for the local accounting of
turnover, with a division into purchases and sales, and
then by the main groups of products?

Please reply to N. P. Gorbunov and write in the greatest
possible detail about the state of the accounting.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

6/XII.

Dear A. M.:

I am very sorry to write in haste. I am terribly tired.
I’ve got insomnia. I am going away for treatment.

I have been requested to write to you: would you write
to Bernard Shaw asking him to go to America, and to Wells
who is said to be in America now, to get them both to help
us in collecting aid to the starving?

It would be a good thing if you wrote them.

The starving will then get a bit more.

The famine is very
bad.[2]

Make sure to have a good rest and better
treatment.[1]


Regards,

Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
On the envelope Lenin wrote: “To P. P. Gorbunov, with the
request to send this on to Berlin for Alexei Maximovich Gorky (from
Lenin) {return the envelope with Gorky’s signature).” On the other
side of the envelope Maxim Gorky wrote: “Received 24.XII.
M. Gorky.”—Ed.
 



[2]
In reply to Lenin’s letter, Maxim Gorky said that he had
written to H. G. Wells, who was in America, asking him to have
a talk with the organisations and persons concerned about
helping the famine-stricken. He wrote: “I have no reply from
Wells, but I am sure that my letter found him in America,
because he quoted extracts from my letter in one of his articles...”

I shall give the C.L.D. business manager an assignment

you. You will be informed in writing or when you come to
the congress about the results of the check-up. I am afraid
that you may go to extremes, in some way, especially in

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is in reply to a letter from I. I. Mezhlauk, Chairman of
the Yugostal Board, of November 27, 1921, about delays in the
issue of working capital earmarked for the trust. He said the
trust had succeeded in getting together skilled miners, and
described their wage rates and the intensified work of the enterprises,
adding that in 1922 the latter would produce 10 million poods
of ferrous metal (6 million poods of pig iron, and 4 million poods
of rolled metal), provided Yugostal received the working capital
earmarked for it by the S.E.C. Presidium on October 27, 1921.

Yugostal, the joint board of the Petrovka, Makeevka and
Yuzovka state factories and mines with all their subsidiary
enterprises and lands in the Ukraine, the Northern Caucasus and the
Crimea. It was set up under the Ukrainian Economic Council
to effect the production, technical and economic unification of
combined enterprises of the metallurgical industry. It was in
operation until 1929.

Krestinsky writes me that Gorky has left Riga without
any money at all and is looking forward to receiving from

    

Stomonyakov royalties for the publication of his books.
Krestinsky believes that Gorky should be included among
the comrades receiving treatment abroad at the expense
of the Party or the Council. I suggest that the Politbureau
should pass a proposal that Krestinsky should include
Gorky among such comrades and see to it that he has all
the money he needs for the necessary
treatment.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Having examined on December 21, 1921, Lenin’s proposal, the
Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee decided: “To
include Comrade Gorky among the comrades receiving medical
treatment abroad, and to instruct Comrade Krestinsky to see
that he has all the money necessary for the treatment” (Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee). See Collected Works, Fifth

Comrade Osinsky:

I have read and reread your letter with all possible
attention. I resolutely disagree, and cannot bring it up
at the Politbureau. It is, of course, your unquestionable
right to bring it up at the plenum.

You have not a shred, literally not a shred, of
businesslike and organisational arguments.

You have made a mistake by insisting on Muralov’s
removal, seeing an “intrigue” where there was not a bit
of it. But in order to direct such a People’s Commissariat,
as the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture, and to do
it in such dreadfully difficult conditions, one must not see
“intrigues” or “counter-weights” in those who take a
different view of matters or have a different approach, but
must value independent-minded men. You must try out
the trio in practice: you + a peasant (we do not yet know
who and what kind of man he will be) + Teodorovich.
There must be no haste to change it before it has come to
life. Your priority influence is assured by the law and by
many other things.

I have seen Mesyatsev at the C.L.D. and the C.P.C.,
but very little. No one can prevent him from attending
(and voting) if neither you nor Teodorovich is there. This
could be formalised in a couple of minutes.
 

But there is no reason to change the Politbureau
decision. It must be tried out; it is organisationally correct.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Written between December
14 and 18, 1921

Comrade Kamenev:

I am sending you the letters of Osinsky and Teodorovich
to me, of which we spoke today.

Osinsky has not, a shred of “business-like” argument.
It is nothing but a case of nerves and a repetition of the
mistake of his sacking Muralov.

I strongly object to taking the question to the Politbureau
as well, and am writing Osinsky about this. Let him take
it to the plenum if he wants to. That is his
right.[1]

Please, show this material and my letter to Stalin and
Zinoviev, and return them to me.

Salut!

Lenin

P. S. I read Teodorovich not the whole of Osinsky’s
letter, but only its practical part, as marked off in red
ink.

[1]
A protest against the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee decision of November 18, 1921, about the conflict in the
People’s Commissariat for Agriculture was brought in by N. Osinsky
at the Plenum of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee, which,
having discussed this question on December 28, confirmed the
Politbureau decision by a unanimous vote (with one abstention).

While preparing for the Plenum, Lenin requested a number of
documents connected with the state of affairs in the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian)
Edition, Vol. 54, Documents 147 and 148).

Notes
 
 



[1]
On December 21, 1921, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee decided: “To take Comrade Lenin’s application into
consideration. To prolong his leave to two weeks” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

the C.P.C. on domestic and foreign policy of the Republic.





[3]
A reference to the following Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee decision of December 8, 1921: “To recognise as
necessary the maintenance of absolute quiet for Comrade Lenin
and to prohibit his secretariat from, sending him any papers
whatever, to enable Comrade Lenin to make a short (say, at least
30-minute) speech at the Congress of Soviets” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

The Ninth All-Russia Congress of Soviets was held from
December 23 to 28, 1921. Lenin gave the All-Russia C.E.C. and

Comrade Litkens

Copies to Comrade Bogdanov and Comrade Lezhava

In connection with the projects put forward by Comrade
Voyevodin and Comrade Lezhava, I authorise you to set
up a commission chaired by you, consisting of Comrade
Bogdanov, with the right of substitution, Comrade Lezhava,
with the right of substitution, and Comrade Voyevodin—to
examine the question of establishing a cinema industry
in
Russia.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The commission, set up on Lenin’s instructions, worked out the
proposals included in the C.L.D. decision of January 4, 1922,
under which camera and film production was transferred from
the People’s Commissariat for Education to the S.E.C.

Later, on March 8, 1922, the C.L.D. reversed the January 4
decision and approved the decision of the S.E.C. Presidium of
February 24, under which the S.E.C. took over the production
of finished and semi-finished products of the camera and film
industry. The People’s Commissariat for Education remained in
charge of the making of films and their distribution, the
operation of cinemas and the slide business.

Comrade Stalin:

I draw your attention to this report from Krasin
(enclosed) which I think is plausible and highly
important.[1]
As soon as Orjonikidze returns, there must be a conference
with Chicherin on this question to work out a number of
proposals for passage through the Politbureau.

In a telegram from London, L. B. Krasin said that, according
to the information received from reliable sources, the Angora
Treaty (a Franco-Turkish Agreement signed in October 1921)
contained secret clauses providing for Turkey’s seizure of the
whole of the Transcaucasus. Krasin wrote that this plan “is
supported by the bloc of former bourgeois Transcaucasian
governments, which arc backed by Briand, who is advising French
financiers to abstain from any deals with the Bolsheviks in the
Caucasus in view of the imminent changes there” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

The most concise information possible
(2-3 figures) and so precise (or with a
reservation of how close it is to the real
thing) as to make it worth while for me
to insert it in my speech at the Congress
of Soviets?

_ _

||

_ _

please let me
have the shortest
possible replies,
one or a
maximum of two
pages



1. To Comrade Chicherin (or, if he is unable to reply, to
Litvinov) and to Comrade Radek

Will it be enough to say, in characterising the
international position of the R.S.F.S.R., that from the side of
Poland and Rumania, it is only their war party that
threatens and not all their ruling classes?

—that the alliance of the four Powers (Britain, the
United States, France and Japan) concluded at the

    

Washington Conference is, first, highly unstable, like all
imperialist alliances; and, second, hostile to all the other
peoples?

Should anything be added to this?

Is it all right to tell about the plan to invite Russia
and Germany to the second conference in April
1922?[4]
What source should I quote? How authentic or probable
is this to be considered?

2. To Comrade Chicherin (Litvinov)

Is it all right to characterise our progress for 1921 by
the increase in the number of trade treaties with European
powers? If it is, list them (in 1920 only with Britain,
and in 1921 with such-and-such countries).

If not, is it ail right to characterise progress in this
respect by means of data other than the volume of trade
exchange (about which I shall inquire from the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade)?

3. To Comrade Lezhava

Is it possible to characterise our progress for 1921 in
terms of developing trade with other countries by means
of two or three figures, however general and approximate?
For instance, purchases and orders in 1920—about so much;
for so many months of 1921, to an approximate figure,
giving a probable total of up to so much?

Is it possible to bring out Germany in this respect?

Is it possible to give two or three final figures on the
volume of our exports in 1921 as compared with that in 1920?

4. To Comrade Fomin

Could you let me have the exact or rough figures about
the number of new locomotives (and cars? and tank cars?)
brought in from abroad in 1921? compared with 1920? and
other products for transport?

ditto: ordered in 1921 for the amount of?

Is it possible for me to give in my report at the Congress
of Soviets facts about the state of transport in 1921
compared with 1920, in the briefest form, stating the essential
(one page)?
 

5. To Comrade Trotsky

Is it possible to add to your theses and your report
something about the army’s economic work? about the
uninterruption of continuous ties with the labour army
councils?[5] and in general according to the assignment formulated
in a decision either by one of the C.C. plenums in 1921,
or one of the Politbureau sittings in the autumn of
1921?[6]

6. To Comrade Khinchuk

Could you supplement the figures for the development
of Centrosoyuz turnover which you have given me (1 
million; 3 and 6 million in gold for August, September and
October
1921),[1]

first, with approximate figures for
November? second, the figure for grain purchases? third, the figure
for the number of gubernia societies which have submitted
their reports out of the total? fourth, any other very brief
results which I could cite in my report at the Congress of
Soviets?

7. To Comrade Osinsky

Could you give me for my report at the Congress of
Soviets 2–3 summary figures, first, on our fulfilment of the
task of supplying peasants with seed for the autumn of
1921; second, on other tangible results or successes already
in evidence in 1921?

8. To Comrade Smilga (or Trifonov)

Could you let me have, for insertion in my report at
the Congress of Soviets, the most concise figures on fuel:

I have Pyatakov’s report on Donbas. Could I have the
results for 1920 and 1921?

ditto on oil?

ditto on peat?

ditto on firewood for 1920 and 1921?

9. To Comrade Bogdanov

Please let me have for my report at the Congress of
Soviets the briefest information (not more than 1/2–1 page
on each point)

on metallurgy for 1921 in comparison with 1920?
 

on
Yugostal?[2]


on the importance and prospect of the enterprise of   Rutgers and his group?

on assistance to the Urals (Hammer’s concessions)

on the textile industry?

on some results of the work of the Central
Administration for the Farms of Industrial Enterprises
(task: the shortest, most indicative figures which could
be cited in the report to show both the great difficulty
of the situation and any small signs of improvement).

10. To Comrade Gorbunov

On electrification

the end of Levi’s
article[7]

increase in the number and capacity of electric-power   stations

for 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921.

The importance of Kashira and Utkina Zavod, and their
forthcoming start in the spring of 1922.

ditto about
Volkhovsite.[8]

11. To Comrades Lunacharsky, Pokrovsky and Litkens


Please let me have for my report at the Congress of
Soviets the briefest data for a graphic picture of the growing
thirst for knowledge, for learning, and progress in this
sphere (not more than 2 or 3 figures on the number of
students, number of libraries, etc.; the most salient points).

12. To Radchenko: about the hydraulic extraction of peat:
what has been ordered in Germany? prospects for 1922?

Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic to hold several
sittings specially to discuss and prepare this” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

On the plenum’s instructions the question of the Army’s
labour tasks was considered by the C.L.D. on August 12, 1921.
Under its decision these matters were referred to the C.P.C.
Having heard on August 16, 1921, the reports of the commissions
set up by the C.L.D., the C.P.C. approved the draft decisions
with some amendments.

On December 20, 1921, there was published a table entitled
“The Growth in the Number of Stations in the Period from 1917
to July 1, 1921” under the caption “Russia’s Electric-Power
Supply” with the following introductory sentence: “In addition
to the general review of Russia’s electric-power supply (see
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn No. 276 of Decembers, 1921), the editorial
board publishes the following table which characterises the
growth in the number of electric-power stations from 1917 to

The Volkhov site, the Volkhov Hydro-Electric Power Station.
The decision to build it was taken by the C.P.C. in July 1918,
and the work was started after the Civil War, in 1921. It was

Comrade Bryukhanov, People’s Commissariat for Food

Please let me have the briefest replies, one or two pages,
not more, to some of the questions to enable me to give a

    

more precise formulation of the corresponding sections of
my report at the Congress of Soviets and to insert some of
the most characteristic figures.

What results in your opinion would it be useful for me
to cite in my report at the Congress of Soviets? On the
results of the tax in kind? On the concealment of arable
land? Or about the most vital and pressing tasks in this
sphere?

It would be well if we could show, briefly and visually,
the relief for the peasants from the tax in kind as compared
with the surplus-requisition system.

Comrade Kamenev:

I am sending you this letter as a supplement to our last
talk. I believe it to be absolutely necessary to have as many
C.C. members as possible make a personal acquaintance
with
Yakovenko[1] at the forthcoming congress. Please send
this letter to all the members of the Orgbureau first, and
then pass it on to the other C.C. members. Ask Molotov
to phone me after he reads the letter.

17/X11–21

Comrade Zalutsky and Comrade Solts

I have learned about the expulsion from the Party of
Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva. I have personally seen

    

her work as a secretary of the C.P.C. Managing
Department, i.e., at very close range. However, I consider it
necessary to point out that I have known the whole
Alliluyev  family, i.e., the father, the mother and the two
daughters, since before the October Revolution. In
particular, during the July days, when Zinoviev and I had to
hide out and the danger was very great, it is this family
that hid me, and the four of them, with the complete
confidence of the Party Bolsheviks at the time, not only gave
us both asylum, but also rendered a number of other secret
services without which we would not have been able to escape
Kerensky’s bloodhounds. It could very well be that in view
of Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva’s youth, this
circumstance has not been made known to the commission. Nor
am I aware whether the commission was able, in examining
the case of Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva, to make a
comparison of the facts about her father, who had worked
in various capacities in assisting the Party long before the
revolution, and had, I have heard, rendered important
services to the illegal Bolsheviks under tsarism.

I consider it my duty to inform the Central Commission
for Purging the Party of these
circumstances.[1]

20.00 hours, December 20, 1921.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Nadezhda Alliluyeva was reinstated in the Party.

Comrade Zalutsky and Comrade Salts

I have had a letter from Comrade Kasparova-Popova
(address: 3 House of Soviets, Flat 63, telephone 58–97).
She writes that she is absolutely desperate about her
expulsion from the Party, and asks me to intercede with the
Central Commission for Purging the Party and request
them to make a thorough verification of her case, referring
to her brother Slava Kasparov and her husband Popov,
who had been sent to the Far East, by Comrade Sverdlov

    

and was killed there. She writes that, together with her
brother, she began to lake an interest in the Party at the
age of 14, was a member of school study circles, and joined
the Party at the age of 17, doing purely technical work.

I do not know this Kasparova personally, or have
forgotten her, but I knew her brother very well abroad, where
he was an émigré after the first revolution of 1905, was a
member of the Bolshevik organisation, and enjoyed the
well-deserved respect of all Bolsheviks with whom I had
occasion to meet and who had seen Kasparov work. This
Kasparov died in Switzerland before the 1917 revolution
(his health being overtaxed by the difficult conditions of
émigré life).

I shall try to collect information about anyone who may
have known Kasparov’s sister better.

For my part, I request the Central Commission for
Purging the Party to verify the case of Comrade Kasparova’s
expulsion from the
Party.[1]

Lenin

20.00 hours, December 20, 1921.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Yevgenia Popova (Kasparova) was reinstated in the Party.

On the document there is the following inscription by C.P.C.
secretary Natalya Lepeshinskaya: “Vladimir Ilyich earnestly
asks Comrades Stalin, Safarov, Zinoviev and Kornblyum
urgently to give information about Comrade Kasparova and also to
find out who else of the comrades knows her well and what they
could say about her.”

Comrade Steklov, Editor,


and Comrade A. Belyakov,


Izvestia Editorial Board

On December 20, Izvestia carried A. Belyakov’s article,
“New Ways of Reviving Railway
Transport”.[1] Will the
author of the article inform me, giving the most precise
indication possible of the corresponding publications:

1) What is the source of the information that the method
of using the ordinary, slightly modified, lorry instead of a
railway locomotive has been tested abroad and has
produced excellent results in general?
 

2) The same thing concerning the fact that in America
such lorries have been used on sidings.

3) About such lorries being successfully used in the
American army during the war (there must be information
about this, if the use was successful, in the American,
French and British press).

4) About the fact that trials were staged in London on
the Russian engineer Kuznetsov’s idea, which have proved
that a 30 h.p. lorry easily pulled a 9–10 car train at a speed
of 20 versts an
hour.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The article described the use of diesel locomotives abroad and
expressed the opinion that they could and should be widely used
on railways in Soviet Russia.





[2]
Over the text of Lenin’s letter, C.P.C. secretary Natalya
Lepeshinskaya wrote: “To the State Planning Commission (Presidium), to the
S.E.C.’s Scientific and Technical Department, to the People’s
Commissariat for Railways. P.S. Comrade Lenin wants to know whether
anything has been said about this in scientific and technical
literature and what is the view taken of this by specialists?” See also

Comrade Molotov:

I think that we should agree right away, and to make
sure send a telegram about this both through Krasin, and
via Berlin, and also via Christiania, by open text and not
in code.

I am not quite clear about the terms of payment and
control from the telegram read out to me. If the deadline
is on the 26th, it is perhaps still possible to have this
checked and clarified, but still we should not in any case let
such an opportunity go by. It would be especially important
to secure the possibility of using this grain not only to
aid the starving, but also for the spring
sowing.[1]

I request Molotov and Kamenev to phone me tonight.

21/XII–21

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a telegram on December 19, 1921, L. B. Krasin said that
William Brown, a representative of AHA, had conveyed to
him the following proposal from Herbert Hoover: the American
Government is prepared to spend $20 million to buy grain and
seed for the famine-stricken gubernias of Russia, provided the
Soviet Government undertook, within three months, beginning
from January 1, 1922, to buy $10 million worth of U.S. food and
seed for the famine-stricken areas. It stipulated that the
purchases were to be made by the Hoover’s Commission (ARA).

The Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. examined this
proposal on December 22, 1921, and decided to accept it, instructing
M. M. Litvinov to reply to Krasin. That same day, Litvinov
urgently cabled Krasin that the proposal had been accepted,
and asked “to set the earliest date for the delivery of grain in
view of the increasingly acute famine situation” (Central Party

   

Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

Comrade Molotov and all members of the Politbureau

1. Please acquaint all members of the Politbureau as
soon as possible with Teodorovich’s communication
concerning the Siberian peasant Yakovenko, which I have
sent
you.[1]

$20 million worth of grain on condition that we spend
$10 
million.[2]

Notes

[2]
A reference to a letter from A. V. Eiduk, the Soviet
Government’s representative with ARA, of December 21, 1921. Eiduk
considered the Hoover proposal disadvantageous both
economically and politically and recommended its rejection, because it
would result in an extension of the ARA apparatus, which was
engaged in hostile activity against Soviet Russia.

Having discussed the question “of political measures in
connection with ARA”, the Politbureau on December 31, 1921,
authorised a commission, consisting of I. S. Unschlicht, A. V.
Eiduk and V. M. Mikhailov, “to work out measures of special
precaution in the event of excessive extension of ARA’s
apparatus and its recruitment of unreliable elements” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee). See also this volume, Document 558.

Comrade Sokolnikov:

I am sending you this
secretly.[2]

I think that Safarov is right (partially, at any rate).

I earnestly request you to examine this objectively to
prevent any squabble, quarrel or revenge from spoiling
the work in Turkestan.

Write me a couple of
words.[3]

Greetings,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
By a Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. decision of October 14,
1921, G. Y. Sokolnikov was appointed Chairman of the
Turkestan Bureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee and the
Turkestan Commission of the All-Russia C.E.C. and the R.S.F.S.R.
Council of People’s Commissars.





[2]
A reference to G. I. Safarov’s letter to Lenin about distortions
of the Party’s national policy in Turkestan. On December 22,
1921, the Politbureau set up a commission to examine the
question of Turkestan affairs. See this volume, Documents 306, 383
and 562.





[3]
On December 24, 1921, G. Y. Sokolnikov informed Lenin about
the charges levelled against G. I. Safarov and his opinion of
the case. A copy of Sokolnikov’s letter with Lenin’s remarks
was sent out to members of the Politbureau.

I consider Sokolnikov’s pamphlet, State Capitalism and
the New Financial Policy, a great success. I think that
you should direct all efforts to do away with our Supreme
Economic Commission and all its subcommissions with
maximum
speed.[1] I very much fear that we have been
dragging out this business by holding forth, while the
need was to concentrate all attention on immediately
taking practical steps and verifying the results.

Comrade Safarov:

Don’t lose your nerve, this is intolerable and shameful,
you are not a 14-year-old miss.

I passed your letters on to Sokolnikov, whom I shall
recommend in the C.C. for dispatch to Turkestan to sort
things out.

I have spoken with Sokolnikov, and have established
(entre nous!) his consent to regard the case started against
you as absurd.

Don’t lose your nerve.

Carry on your work, and don’t give up any of your
duties. You must learn to collect the facts, calmly and
purposefully, against those who have started this absurd case.

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is in reply to G. I. Safarov’s letter. In particular, on
December 20, 1921, Safarov informed Lenin that, in view of the
examination of the material concerning his activity in
Turkestan by the Central Control Commission, he had handed in an
application to the Party C.C. to the effect that he intended to
abstain from any responsible work (at the time Safarov was
consultant on Eastern affairs in the Comintern). See also this volume,

Comrade Molotov

I absolutely insist on an immediate Politbureau decision
by telephone about Rudzutak’s urgent dispatch
(immediately after the plenum on the trade unions) to Germany:
he is running a temperature and is spitting blood. Clearly,
his TB is getting worse.

Over here, he won’t be cured and, what is most
important, he won’t be given a strict
regimen.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On December 26, 1921, the Orgbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.,
in accordance with Lenin’s proposal, recognised the need to send
Y. E. Rudzutak for medical treatment in Germany, and asked
People’s Commissar for Public Health N. A. Semashko to give

   

his conclusion concerning the place and time of the former’s leave,
and the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to
expedite his departure. See also this volume, Document 667.

Comrade Yaroslavsky:

Please let me have your own opinion, and collect that
of all the responsible and influential Siberian comrades
now here, about the peasant Yakovenko (I think he is
chairman of the Kansk Uyezd Executive Committee, Yeniseisk
Gubernia). The opinions should be as detailed as possible.
They are for the purpose of discussing in the C.C.
Yakovenko’s appointment as People’s Commissar for
Agriculture.[1]


Age? — About 40 years
old.[2]


Experience? — Direct experience in Soviet work.

Respect of peasantry? — Great.

Knowledge of economics? — Middle peasant, never had a
very big farm.

Strength of mind? — Authoritative, firm.

Brains? — Intelligent, quick-witted.
 

Loyalty to the Soviet power? — Proved his loyalty both
in the partisan period and
after.

Will you do this fast and properly.

Lenin

Comrade Trotsky:

I have not yet seen your letter with the amendment to
my draft resolution, I have only heard about its content
from the secretary. I quite agree with the main idea. I think,
however, that the concept of specialists must include not
only engineers and agronomists, but also merchants. If you
can, get someone to send me a copy of your conclusion
which is being sent to the C.C., because I shall be in
Moscow
today.[1]

Comrade Lezhava, People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade

The report of Comrade Yemelyanov, who can and must
be regarded as absolutely reliable, concerning the stealing
during the discharge at Revel, is a source of extremely
great apprehension and raises a question of tremendous
importance.[1]

 

I draw the attention of the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade to this fact, for the purpose of taking the
most vigorous measures, with check-ups through reliable
men, informing me of the results of the check-up and the
measures taken. Send the reply to Comrade Smolyaninov.

Lenin

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

If this is true, it is not
bad.[2]

Perhaps these two things could be done:

1) a weekly (monthly for a start) inventory for the whole
R.S.F.S.R.

a) of the quantity of commodities held by the state


(exchange fund)

b) quantity of bank-notes

2) by way of experiment in one or two uyezds issue
(through co-operative establishments?) exchange bonds, fully
secured by the commodity fund?

Inventorying the commodity fund is not the business of the
People’s Commissariat for Finance. This calls for some additional
structuring or restructuring to take account of all the material
budget. Still, we have authorised Syromolotov to do this.

The bonds could be issued when the commodities are available,
and, I think, they will be all right, but in the initial period there will
be little benefit for our own pocket.


{{

My purpose is not “benefit for the pocket”,
but experiment, experience.

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky, copy to Comrade Smolyaninov

I am sending on to you, for your information,
G. B. Krasin’s opinion. This opinion confirms me in the view
I wrote to you about
yesterday.[1]1 fear that the convocation
of a conference was a strategically incorrect measure on
your part. It would have been more correct to demand an
opinion in writing from the solid specialists numbering two
or three, no more, for each of the three establishments
(Gosplan, People’s Commissariat for Railways, and the
S.E.C.’s Scientific and Technical Department). I believe
the task is above all to “catch out” the scientists who have
missed the foreign experience, as being idle and pedantic.
I think neither Krasin’s opinion, nor this memo of mine
should be shown to anyone. Unless your conference
reaches an absolutely negative conclusion, then we should
think about who should be assigned the immediate practical
performance. Please phone me about
this.[2]

Lenin 

27/XII-21
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the review by engineer G. B. Krasin of A. 
Belyakov’s article “New Ways of Reviving Railway Transport”, which
was written at Lenin’s request (see this volume, Document 557).
Krasin wrote that “the use of diesel locomotives could probably
be highly fruitful” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

The letter addressed to G. M. Krzhizhanovsky on December
26, 1921, has not been found.





[2]
On January 4, 1922, the C.L.D., having recognised that the
introduction of diesel locomotives was of especial importance,
instructed the Thermal Technical Institute, with the assistance of
the Technical Committee of the People’s Commissariat for
Railways and other establishments, to organise the outlining of
projects and technical specifications for diesel locomotives and “to
announce a competition for the best diesel locomotive design with
the award of a prize....” By the same decision, the State Planning
Commission, together with the Thermal Technical Institute and the
People’s Commissariat for Railways, was instructed to work
out, within ten days, “detailed terms for prizes and a competition
for subsequent extensive publication of them in Russia and
abroad” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Béla Kun:

I have received your letter, in which, as my secretary
tells me, you request acceleration of my article about
Serrati. Unfortunately, because of my ailment I have been
unable up to now to start carrying it out on the basis of
the material which has been sent to me, unfortunately,
in excessive abundance.

It looks as if I shall be unable to write it by the  stated
deadline.[1]

Write a note to Fotieva about how things are, what

    

you are writing, and how you have arranged things for the
400 Hungarian Communists who have arrived.

Lenin did not write a special article on Serrati; he described

Dear Comrade:

It is necessary that an end should be put once and for
all to the scandalous red tape and delays in your
establishment. Time and again, there is neither reply to nor
execution of the important and urgent matters being directed
to you by the C.P.C. office for the purpose of settling
the numerous complaints and applications addressed to
the C.P.C. and its Chairman.

My suggestion is that you pull yourself together at once.
The machinery of Soviet administration must work
accurately, smoothly and swiftly. Any slackness in it does
damage not only to the interests of individuals but to the
whole business of administration, which becomes illusory
and imaginary.

Assuming the real measure of labour productivity in
each given establishment to be above all the extent to
which all business passing through it is actually executed
without delay, I demand that henceforth you submit the
quickest and most exhaustive replies to all the cases and
inquiries directed to you. To confine yourself to formal
replies and dispatch to other establishments also means
breeding red tape and wasting paper.

I warn you that if this manner of action continues the
C.P.C. office is authorised to start proceedings against
the guilty persons without regard for “rank”.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, C.P.C.

Comrade Zalutsky:

I am sending on this letter to you. Pass it on where it
belongs, if it has nothing to do with you.

The charges against such an old Party member and
revolutionary, known to every Latvian, and then to Trotsky
and many others during the war, are clearly incredible.
I have known Danishevsky throughout the Party’s history,
years and years before the revolution, and I request that
everything, should be checked carefully, rigorously
and
comprehensively.[1]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On the strength of unverified accusations, K. Kh. Danishevsky
was expelled from the R.C.P.(B.), at the end of 1921, by the
Khamovniki District Commission (Moscow) for Purging the Party.


The Central Commission for Checking up on the Membership
of the R.C.P.(B.) rejected the groundless accusations and
reinstated Danishevsky in the Party.

Put emphasis on the fact that Trotsky’s mistakes at
the Tenth Congress are being all repeated.

Another thing I forgot to say: in his “amendments”,
he takes an administrative approach (“threat”, “shake up”—
rearrange everything, “one-man responsibility”) to that
which should be dealt with

(a) through propaganda,

(b) through long
experience.[1]

Kamenev

Copies: Bukharin and P. P. Gorbunov

Comrade Kamenev:

I have just learned about Goldenberg’s death. They say
he had a heart attack. I very much fear, am almost sure,
that it is our negligence that is to blame in this case,
because he was an extremely sickly man, and we failed
entirely to take care of him. It is my earnest request that you
make arrangements:
1) for the funeral to be held properly
(I wonder if it is convenient to do this through the Moscow
Soviet or the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs);
2) then we should look after his wife, who is probably
absolutely without any money and who, I happen to know,
is absolutely helpless and unadapted to the present
Russian life;
3) we should also have the press carry an obituary.

He was obviously sent to his grave by his life as an
émigré and by our Russian negligence. We have been losing
valuable workers in an absolutely unpardonable
manner.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes

At the top of the document, C.P.C. and C.L.D. secretary Lydia
Fotieva wrote: “To N. P. Gorbunov, Nikolai Petrovich,
Vladimir Ilyich wants you to see that what Kamenev undertakes should
be fulfilled as soon as possible, that is, to put pressure
wherever necessary. 1/I–22. L. Fotieva.”

The obituary on “losif Petrovich Goldenberg (Meshkovsky)” was
published in Pravda on January 3, 1922.

Comrade Molotov for all members of the Politbureau
(concerning Chicherin’s reference to Bogdanov’s
letter to Urquhart)

I think it would be useful to appoint an inquiry, but
we should not disavow Bogdanov’s move, let us consider;
first, let all Politbureau members have a text of Bogdanov’s
letter; second, let us await the results of the inquiry; third,
we still have enough time to decide on our terms after
the resumption of the talks.
[This][1]

does not bind us in
any way, and may to some extent be useful to
us.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes

Omission in the text restored according to meaning.—Ed.
 



[2]
A reference to G. V. Chicherin’s letter to the Politbureau of
the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. of December 2, 1921, saying that, according
to information received from L. B. Krasin in London, S.E.C.
Chairman P. A. Bogdanov had allegedly written a letter to
Leslie Urquhart about resuming the concession talks which he
had broken off. Chicherin felt that Bogdanov’s letter could be
interpreted as the Soviet Government’s surrender to private
capital, and requested a repudiation.

This question was examined by the Politbureau on January
12, 1922. In accordance with Lenin’s proposal, the Politbureau
instructed I. S. Unschlicht, Deputy Chairman of the All-Russia
Cheka, to investigate how Bogdanov’s letter to Taube, which
had been sent on to Krasin in London, got into Urquhart’s hands.
The Politbureau agreed with the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs that Bogdanov had made a mistake by addressing
himself to Taube in circumvention of the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade, and recognised that it was “inadmissible to
bring up at the Politbureau questions sharply affecting
responsible workers (Comrade Bogdanov) without obtaining the
necessary information beforehand” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

To Comrade Molotov (concerning Chicherin’s reference
to the declaration proposed by Lloyd George)

I think that, far from it being necessary for us to make
haste, the terms are in general absolutely unacceptable.
Inform Krasin of this in strict secrecy, or perhaps we need
not inform him at all, but wait for the conference at which
we shall make a concrete
statement.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to G. V. Chicherin’s letter to the Politbureau of
the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. of December 30 and L. B. Krasin’s
telegram from London of December 28, 1921.

Krasin communicated the following approximate text of the
Soviet Government’s declaration proposed by Lloyd George as
a condition for the recognition of the R.S.F.S.R. by the
capitalist countries and extension of economic assistance to it: “The
Soviet Government, with the proviso of its de jure recognition
and the extension of assistance to Russia in her rehabilitation,
agrees to recognise as binding on itself all the financial
obligations of the tsarist and the Provisional Government. It is
furthermore proposed that the Soviet Government should pay the
losses of foreign governments and private persons, in so far as
these losses resulted from the Soviet Government’s acts or
omissions on its part, provided the foreign governments made good
the losses inflicted by them on Russia, with the settlement of

   

all matters involving losses to be effected by an arbitration
tribunal on the basis of the generally recognised principles of
international law and the principles of trade relations prevailing
in civilised countries.”

In the opinion of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Affairs, Chicherin wrote to the Politbureau, “this
proposal is an attempt to blackmail us once again before the
session of the Supreme Council”, and it should be rejected, with
the declaration that the Soviet Government is prepared to
discuss the question of the private debts at a conference. The
Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs
considered the arbitration tribunal to be absolutely unacceptable,
“because there cannot be any impartial arbitration tribunal
between the Soviet Republic and the capitalist states”.

Having discussed on December 31, 1921, Krasin’s telegram
about Britain’s proposals, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
C.C. decided “to agree with Comrade Chicherin” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

To Comrade, Molotov for members of the Politbureau

Comrade Preobrazhensky told me by phone that he would
resign if Krasnoshchekov is appointed second deputy, and
that is also the opinion of the whole Collegium with the
exception, it seems, of Sokolnikov. Stalin believes that
the decision should he confirmed but its execution held
up until Sokolnikov’s return otherwise Krasnoshchekov
may he badly badgered. I think that this danger will
remain, unless the Politbureau comes out at once with full
force against the Collegium, and unless it backs up and
supports Krasnoshchekov to the hilt. I consider this
question extremely important because a crying mistake is
being made not only by the whole collegium, but also
by Preobrazhensky, who are unable to see the need for
making all-round use of a man who, with solid experience
of work in America and in the Far-Eastern Republic, takes
a practical approach to financial matters. That is the most
important thing. That is precisely what Preobrazhensky
and the other members of the collegium lack. Their whole
opposition to Krasnoshchekov is a tissue of harmful
prejudices. That is why I should favour immediate passage
of the decision on Krasnoshchekov through Soviet
channels.[1]

Comrade Litvinov:

I am sending you Mikhailov’s letter. Perhaps, you will
find it appropriate to arrange a conference with Scheinman
and Lezhava or with anyone Lezhava may authorise, to
prepare at once a draft decision on this urgent
matter.[1]

Lenin

The R.S.F.S.R. plenipotentiary representative in Norway,
L. M. Mikhailov, reported that the Norwegian Council of
Ministers had decided to pass through the Storting a loan to Soviet
Russia for the purchase of herring, with the proviso that, when
the transaction was concluded, 50 per cent of the cost was to be
paid in cash and the rest in equal instalments by October 15,
1922, and January 1, 1923. Mikhailov asked for a telegram
stating the amount of the transaction.

After additional negotiations and specification of the terms,
the agreement was signed.

Comrade Molotov

Having learned from Kamenev that the C.P.C. has
unanimously adopted Lunacharsky’s absolutely improper
proposal to preserve the Bolshoi Opera and Ballet, I suggest
that the Politbureau should resolve:

1. To instruct the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C.
to rescind the C.P.C. decision.

2. Of the opera and ballet company, to leave only a
few dozen actors for Moscow and Petrograd so that their

    

performances (both operatic and choreographic) should
pay,[1]

i.e., by eliminating all large expenses on properties, etc.

3. Of the thousands of millions saved in this way at
least one-half to be allotted to wiping out illiteracy and
for reading rooms.

4. To summon Lunacharsky for five minutes, to hear
the last word of the accused, it being pointed out to him
and to all People’s Commissars that in future introducing
and putting to the vote of resolutions like the one now
being rescinded by the C.C., will entail stricter measures
on the part of the
C.C.[2]

Lenin

12/I–22
 

Notes
 

[1]
For instance, through participation by opera singers and ballet
dancers in all kinds of concerts, etc.—Lenin
 



[2]
Lenin’s proposal sprang from the country’s grave financial
position and the need to increase appropriations for schools and
the wiping out of illiteracy.

That same day, January 12, 1922, the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee adopted a decision “To authorise
the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C. to rescind the C.P.C.
decision on preserving the Bolshoi Opera and Ballet”, arid by
a subsequent decision on January 17 authorised the All-Russia
C.E.C. “to examine Comrade Lunacharsky’s application in

   

substance”. On February 6, 1922, the Presidium of the All-Russia
C.E.C. adopted the following decision: “To bring to the notice
of the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee that
the group of the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C., having
examined Lunacharsky’s letter and heard the explanations given
by Malinovskaya (Director of the Bolshoi Theatre.—Ed.), has
found that it is economically inexpedient to close down the
Bolshoi Theatre.” In connection with this proposal, the Politbureau
instructed the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection “to submit an exact calculation of the maintenance
of the Bolshoi Theatre in its present state, and of the reduction
of expenditures which could be obtained on its closure”. On March 
13, the Politbureau, having heard the report by V. A.
Avanesov, Deputy People’s Commissar for Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection, decided to “satisfy the 6/11–22 petition of the
All-Russia C.E.C.”

Comrade Molotov:

In sending you Comrade Krestinsky’s letter, I propose,
for my part, to the Orgbureau, and to the Politbureau on
some points, that we resolve:

1. To appoint, by agreement with the People’s
Commissariat for Health, one or two doctors to make regular
examinations of Sokolnikov, Tsyurupa, and other comrades
who have returned after treatment, instructing them to
issue their orders in writing concerning the necessary
regimen. This to be the personal responsibility of the doctor.
Bind him to submit a short report to the C.C. Secretariat,
or, if the C.C. Secretariat agrees, then to the C.P.C.
Secretariat.

2. To impose on some definite person the responsibility
for seeing that Sokolnikov abides by the regimen.

3. To bind Tsyurupa to spend three days a week
(Saturday, Sunday and Monday) in Kashira at the home of his

    

brother G. D. Tsyurupa, under his supervision, in the sense
of complete rest and good nutrition.

4. To place upon Tsyurupa the duty to reduce the
amount of his work, in particular, to relieve himself almost
entirely from work on commissions, concentrating his
activity on supervising the practical execution of some of
the most important decisions of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D.

5. To put upon Tsyurupa the duty to limit C.P.C. and
C.L.D. sittings to no more than three hours in
general.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Orgbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee agreed with
Lenin’s proposal on the first and second points of the published
document, and on January 13, 1922, adopted the following
decision: “To instruct the People’s Commissariat for Public Health
to appoint one or two doctors to carry out regular examination
of all comrades who have returned from abroad. To place the
responsibility on the doctor, putting on him the duty to submit
a short report to the C.P.C. Secretariat.”

Points 3, 4 and 5 were agreed by the Politbureau members
by phone and were included as a whole in the Politbureau
decision of January 18, 1922 (Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee). See

Soviet Government Delegation


London

The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade announced
in December that 8 million poods of grain had been
purchased but not shipped. Having received new credits, the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade has undertaken
the obligation to deliver 15 million poods of food grain by
April 1, at five million a month. In January so far, not a
single pood has been received, and there is no news of any
ships sailing or of proposed shipments. In view of the
extremely grave food situation, I propose that you inform
us within two days: first, how much grain has been
purchased; second, how much has been shipped, on which
ships and to which ports; third, how much and when is to
be shipped shortly; fourth, plan for meeting obligation to
purchase 15 million
poods.[1]

Comrade Yenukidze:

Comrade Lalayants tells me that his family needs
assistance through a grant to be able to carry on until March.
Have a talk with Stalin: how could this be done? On
behalf of the C.C.? or of the All-Russia C.E.C. Presidium?
Please write to me through Fotieva—whether or not this
can be arranged (Lalayants should be asked about the
amount)? If there are any difficulties, which are they?
where?

I shall then seek ways and means. Please, pass this on
to Stalin: incidentally, I request him to make an
arrangement with Lalayants about work for Lalayants. I see,
after my talk with Lalayants, that I cannot settle this.
It has to be decided by Stalin in the Orgbureau or with
the Orgbureau’s
help.[1]

Yours,

16.I.1922

Personal

Secret

Comrade Unschlicht, All-Russia Cheka


and Comrade Fomin, People’s Commissariat for Railways

Copy to N. P. Gorbunov

A few days ago, I had occasion to see for myself the
state of the All-Russia Cheka railway trolleys, which are
apparently in the joint charge of the All-Russia Cheka
and the P.C.R. I think that railway trolleys are absolutely
indispensable for the All-Russia Cheka, and the People’s
Commissariat for Defence (I have heard that the
All-Russia Cheka has two) at the Moscow Junction for very
fast assignments, for highly urgent and highly secret
dispatch of small (5–10 men) detachments, etc.

I found the railway trolleys in the worst state possible,
I saw utter neglect, semi-ruin (very many things have
been stolen!), total disorder, the fuel appears to have been
stolen, there is water in the kerosene, the engine running
excruciatingly, stoppages on the way every minute, the
traffic wretched, delays at the stations, station-masters
completely uninformed (apparently without any idea at
all that the Ail-Russia Cheka trolleys should have special
travelling warrants, and that they should go through with
maximum speed not in the sense of running speed—these
machines are apparently “Soviet”, i.e., are very bad ones—
but in the sense of the shortest possible delays and waste
of time, with military precision), there is chaos,
slovenliness and absolute disgrace. Fortunately, being incognito
on the trolley, I was able to hear and did hear, frank and
truthful (and not the officially honeyed and lying) talk of
the officials, and I understood from their talk that this was
no exception, but that the whole organisation was incredibly
disgraceful, with complete dislocation and clumsiness.

This was the first time I travelled along the railway
lines not as a “dignitary”, getting all and sundry to hustle
with dozens of special telegrams, but as an unknown

    

person travelling with All-Russia Cheka men, and the
impression I got was one of depressing hopelessness. If such is
the state of a special small gear in the mechanism under
the special supervision of the All-Russia Cheka itself,
I can well imagine the state of things in the P.C.R. in
general! The disorder there must he incredible.

I propose: to appoint at once, by agreement between
the All-Russia Cheka and the P.C.R. (perhaps also getting
the People’s Commissariat for Defence to join, if it has
any trolleys?), a responsible person who would be close to
the actual thing, and not a high-ranking official. This
person to be strictly responsible for any negligence.

Issue a short military-worded instruction about the
All-Russia Cheka trolleys, about their secret and rapid
movements, maintenance in good repair, storage of fuel, traffic
without delays along the Circular Road, the junction and
everywhere, etc., etc. Add to the instruction, by the way,
that at the request of N. P. Gorbunov (who will be doing
this only with my consent) a railway trolley is to be made
available promptly and run to the place he designates.

Send detailed report on execution to N. P. Gorbunov,
C.P.C. business manager.

I also authorise Gorbunov to verify execution from time
to time, i.e., make unannounced trips on railway trolleys,
noting down the minutes required for each operation
(summons, running time, stops, etc.) and inspection.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.

Secret
To Comrade Molotov, at the Politbureau:

1) Perhaps we should demand special guarantees against
the fascists (e.g., either an Italian warship with a

    

wireless at our disposal? the names of responsible
persons in the Italian army and police, etc.)?

2) Perhaps we should at once inform them that our
delegates will number from ... to ... ((+ staff))? When shall
we call the All-Russia C.E.C. session?

3) On the whole (and about the rest) Chicherin is right.

4) Perhaps we should appoint on behalf of the All-Russia
C.E.C. (as a subtle point):

Lenin —Chairman

Chicherin—Deputy with all the powers of the Chairman,
in the event the latter cannot go.


{{

Joffe ??

2 assistant deputies?

and

or 3–4

?? Krasin ??

}}

assistant
deputies?[2]

5) Perhaps we should start at once only personal talks
(without any papers) in Berlin and Moscow with the
Germans about contacts between us and them at Genoa?

6) Perhaps we should at once suggest secretly to all the
plenipotentiary representatives to put out feelers with
the governments concerned to find out whether or not
they are prepared to start unofficial secret talks with
us on a preliminary marking out of the line at Genoa?

16/I. Lenin
 

Notes

Written under the text of G. V. Chicherin’s proposals
concerning a reply to the Allied Supreme Council, which on
January 6, 1922, adopted a resolution on the convocation of an
All-European Economic and Financial Conference, and on the
main conditions which the Supreme Council believed were
necessary for its success.

The question of a reply to the Supreme Council of the Entente
about the international conference at Genoa was discussed by
the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on January 17, 1922, which
decided: “To agree in general with Comrade Chicherin’s proposals,
with Comrade Lenin’s additions and amendments taken down
by Comrade Chicherin” (Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On January 27, 1922, an Extraordinary Session of the
All-Russia C.E.C. approved the composition of the Soviet delegation to

   

the Genoa Conference. On the delegation were L. B. Krasin,

16/I.1922
To Molotov
for all members of the Politbureau

1) Chicherin’s papers show that he is
sick.[1] We must
ask the best doctors urgently whether it is better to 

a) postpone his whole leave (six months) until after
Genoa?


Will he be able to stand the pace?
 

b) or let him have a rest right away for one month or
five weeks, from 18.I. to 22.II., which leaves two
weeks until 8.III., and special leave after Genoa?


(b seems to be the only correct
approach).[2]

2) Things at the P.C.F.A. appear to be in a state of
dangerous chaos. Is it not risky to dispatch all the best
men from the P.C.F.A. to Genoa, leaving a hole at the
P.C.F.A. here?

This question should be placed under the most immediate,
direct supervision by the Politbureau.

3) Special responsibility must be placed on someone
(perhaps Litvinov + Vorovsky + Joffe + P. P. Gorbunov?)
for seeing that when Chicherin and the whole delegation
leave for Genoa, all P.C.F.A. affairs are handed over to
specified persons in complete order.

Someone of the most experienced diplomatists should
be left to head the P.C.F.A. for the entire Genoa
period.[3]

4) The best and completely reliable cipher clerks should
be found right away with the assignment to prepare the
most reliable codes for Genoa (with keys changed every
day) for the entire Genoa period.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In two letters to the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. of
January 15, 1922, G. V. Chicherin, in connection with the holiday
offered to him, characterised the state of affairs at the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

He said the work was not going smoothly because of a shortage
of trained personnel and added that there was no one at the
Commissariat who was informed about the whole range of questions.
He wrote that it was impossible for him to go on holiday just
then. It would take him several months to hand over his affairs
and introduce someone to all his duties at the Commissariat,
something it was absolutely impossible to do during the intense
preparation for the Genoa Conference. Chicherin insisted that
“a holiday at the present time is tantamount to my total
departure” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).





[2]
The question of Chicherin’s leave and medical treatment was
examined at several sittings of the Politbureau, and he was given
leave after the Genoa Conference.





[3]
On January 26, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
instructed A. A. Joffe, J. A. Hanecki and P. P. Gorbunov “to
prepare the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs for being in a state
of complete clarity and precision of work by the time Comrades
Chicherin and Litvinov leave.... To bear in mind the possibility
of Comrade Karakhan’s being summoned in the absence of
Chicherin and Litvinov, and also the possibility that one or two
comrades from the diplomatic section of the delegation will have
to take turns staying in Moscow to carry on” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

Comrade Molotov:

I am sending on to you Vorovsky’s inquiry and Axelrod’s
application. This needs a decision.

Axelrod has worked here in the Comintern and for the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. I have known
him as a Bolshevik since 1916 in Zurich, and support his
application for assistance to him and his wife in one form
or
another.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

The question of material assistance to T. L. Axelrod was
examined by the Secretariat of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee
on January 21, 1922. His request was met.

17.I.1922

Comrade Smolyaninov:

I am sending you G. D. Tsyurupa’s
reports.[1]


This is shocking red tape.

The work of the People’s Commissariat for Railways
is wretched.

And to think that this is for Kashira, an establishment
of exceptional importance! An establishment about which
there is a special Politbureau directive, concerning the
obligatory nature of all sorts of pressure and acceleration!
And to think that this should happen after dozens of
telegrams, etc., from me about Kashira!

What, in that case, happens to the ordinary freight?
Apparently something quite crazy!

I propose to you:

1) to start proceedings for red tape, and take the case
all the way to the strictest punishment;

2) put pressure on the P.C.R. and, apart from the trial,
secure measures for enhancing responsibility and
improving the work.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.

      1

17.I.1922
To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau

I enclose Lezhava’s report on the Steinberg concession.
Please have this matter raised in the Politbureau on

    

Thursday, so as to allow the C.P.C. to pass the C.C.
decision through Soviet government channels on
Friday.[1]

Appoint two rapporteurs on this question for the
Politbureau: A. D. Tsyurupa and a representative of the C.P.C.
majority.

This is an important business, and I very much fear
that the C.P.C. majority (opposing Tsyurupa) is about to
make another mistake in the spirit of “communist conceit”:
they are afraid to allow a merchant who knows how to trade
to make money, and their overriding concern is only to
secure a majority for the Communists, most of whom may
bawl a bit, but then they never touch the
stuff.[2]

I draw your attention to § 5: three Communists (ignorant
of trade? I know of only two Communists who have shown
an ability to trade: Belov (GUM) and Serg. Malyshev)
are about to teach two merchants how to trade.

I am afraid that this “majority” will look very much
like Shchedrin’s
accoucheurs.[3]

Perhaps § 5 should be amended as follows: Steinberg,
as representative, be empowered to decide everything alone,
while the majority of the board should have the right to
know everything and to complain to us about Steinberg’s
acts, without suspending them (i.e., the majority of three
against two will nominally retain the right to reverse
Steinberg’s decisions, but we shall tell him that we shall not
reverse anything without a special C.L.D. decision).

Meanwhile, the three Communists will be given the duty,
by a special C.C. decision, to study and to learn the
business in three years or so, otherwise they will be expelled
with ignominy.

Lenin

2
To Comrade Molotov (for members of the Politbureau)
  To Comrade Tsyurupa and Comrade Lezhava with a request
  for their opinion

The C.L.D. is meeting in plenary session today.
Perhaps, it could be possible, so as not to put off the matter,

    

to adopt by phone the following proposal concerning the
Steinberg concession (Politbureau decision mandatory upon
the C.L.D.): “To accept the Lezhava commission’s
proposal with an addendum of this kind: Steinberg, as
representative of the board, shall act on his own, with decisions
by the board majority (3 representatives of the board,
1—Steinberg, 1—capitalist), without suspending
Steinberg’s order, only referable to the
C.L.D.”[4]

This addendum should be adopted by the C.L.D., but not
written into the board’s charter. Then, by informing
Steinberg of this decision, we shall, on the one hand, provide
the possibility of really doing business commercially to
a man who knows commerce otherwise than from reading
communist booklets and, on the other, in the event of
Steinberg committing any crime, we shall assure ourselves
of the possibility of revoking our decision through the
C.L.D., without altering the Society’s charter in any way.
I think that such a guarantee is quite sufficient.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s letter to the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on
January 17, 1922, was discussed on January 20. The Politbureau
decided to have the question of granting Steinberg a concession
finally settled by the C.P.C. (see also this volume, Document 515).





[2]
These words are from Ivan Krylov’s fable, “The Musicians”,

   

which tells of a choir of serf peasants who sang very poorly, but
were a model of sobriety.





[3]
Meaning people who are prepared to engage in any activity
regardless of their qualification, so long as they have the authority
and the assignment. “I am prepared to be an accoucheur at any
time,” is a sentence from an introduction by the Russian
satirical writer Saltykov-Shchedrin to his novel The Golovlyov
Family.





[4]
Lenin’s proposal was adopted the same day by the Politbureau
of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. On January 24, the Council of People’s
Commissars approved in substance the draft statutes of the
Joint-Stock Company for Domestic and Export Trade in Hides and
Skins (Kozhsyryo). On February 1, the statutes of the company
and the articles of association were approved by the C.L.D.

  Comrade Smolyaninov

Having looked over some of the tables, I propose that

1) clear additions in ink, in a fine hand, should always
be made of absolute monthly figures (thousands or millions)
(as in Table V, 4).

2) The same always in the margins of the table

pre-war figure (1913 or 1916, etc.)
such-and-such (absolute figure).

3) The whole importance of these tables lies in their
being visual and comparable. That is why tables for 36
months: 1920–1921–1922, should be made to fit in the same
form

(have all the 36 months 1920–1922 in one table).

17/I. Lenin
 

+ 4) Instead of heavy lines (/\) light lines (/\) will do: this
will be simpler, clearer and easier to draw and will require
fewer officials.

5) A bit of day-dreaming: have all the tables clipped
into one sheaf (2 or 3, if it is too thick) to facilitate
paging.

Comrade Molotov:

I am applying to the C.C. Secretariat (and if that is not
within its competence, then to the Orgbureau) with a
request about two comrades:

1) The daughter of Margarita Vasilyevna Fofanova, 15
years old, is afflicted with a grave form of bone
tuberculosis. Please have her sent (with her mother, if necessary),
to our sanatorium in Riga. Of course, they have no means.

I have known M. V. Fofanova as a vigorous and loyal
member of the Bolshevik Party since the summer of 1917.
In the autumn of that same year, before the October
Revolution, she hid me at her flat in the most dangerous
period.

Since the October 1917 Revolution, she has been
working hard all the time, without a break. Her daughter’s
grave illness is putting a terrible strain on her and upsets
her
work.[2]

(Fofanova’s address: 4 House of Soviets, 5 
Vozdvizhenka,
Flat 31.[1]

)



2) I request that Nina Kotovich-Sammer, 14 years old,
be placed at a model boarding school of the People’s
Commissariat for Education.

She should be admitted in the first form of the upper
school.
 

Address: Centrosoyuz hostel, 2/15 Maroseika.

I knew her father, the, late Ivan Adamovich Sammer,
very well: an old revolutionary and a Bolshevik. A member
of the C.C. even before the first (1905) revolution. He died
in the Ukraine in 1920, his health broken by
overwork.[3]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

 

Notes
 

[1]
The address is in a secretary’s hand.—Ed.
 



[2]
On February 1, 1922, the Secretariat of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
decided to send Margarita Fofanova’s daughter for treatment
abroad, together with her mother if need be.





[3]
On January 23, 1922, Lenin was informed by the bureau of the
Secretariat of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee that N. 
Sammer-Kotovich had been placed in the experimental model school
of the People’s Commissariat for Education as a boarder.

Comrade Bryukhanov
(Copies to Comrade Kamenev and Comrade Tsyurupa,
to Comrade Stalin)

I most definitely disagree with you. I think that in view
of the terrible disorder at the Commissariat for Food
in the Ukraine, Frumkin is needed there. It is my firm
conviction that the Commissariat for Food in general has
to pull itself together most decidedly. Perhaps, Klyshko or
someone else will do for the purchases abroad. We must
send a very strict telegram to
Krasin.[1]

19/I.

Comrade Stalin:

If you decide to send Frumkin to the Ukraine, Krasin
should be sent an extra-vigorous telegram:

Unless you buy 15 million poods of grain in January
and February, we shall dismiss you from your

    

office and expel you from the Party. There is a
desperate need for grain. Red tape is intolerable. The
Vneshtorg apparatus is bad. There are delays over
foreign currency. Do everything you possibly can.
Telegraph precisely on the execution twice a week.
Approve this tomorrow, 20/I, and send on behalf of  the
Politbureau,[1] in addition put all the pressure possible
on Litvinov (for the sake of currency) and check up
personally 2 or 3 times a
week.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On January 20, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee recognised the need to intensify the delivery of grain
from the Ukraine and adopted a decision to send Deputy People’s
Commissar for Food, M. I. Frumkin, to the Ukraine with
special powers.

The same decision also approved, with some amendments
(instead of “dismiss from office and expel from the Party”—“the
Party will be forced to take the most drastic measures of
punishment”), the draft telegram to L. B. Krasin proposed by Lenin.
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).





[2]
Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, M. M. Litvinov,
was concurrently C.P.C. representative for currency
operations.

19.I.1922.

Comrade Krasin:

Concerning Larin, to the Politbureau decision of
17.I.[2]
I add:

1. Keep him in London as long as possible.

2. If you take any of his figures on trust, we shall sack
you.

3. Take care of his health, provide better treatment,
appoint a responsible doctor.

4. Give him a long literary job
with German and English
sources (if he does not know English, teach him).

Carry out points 1, 3 and 4 with especial strictness and
especial tact. Point 2—three times as strictly.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

P.S. The Vneshtorg apparatus is downright bad. Lezhava
is weak. There is need for a better man. The grain is needed
desperately and urgently. Put into this everything you
have. It is your
responsibility.[1]


Lenin

On January 17, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
decided to satisfy L. B. Krasin’s request “concerning Comrade
Larin’s recall at his disposal”.

The published letter was sent to the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Affairs with the following inscription by Lenin: “To
the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. To P. P.
Gorbunov: for dispatch as soon and as confidentially as possible.
Return the envelope to me with Krasin’s signature. 19.I.1922.
Lenin. To Comrade Krasin in London (19.I.1922 from Lenin)”

Comrade Avanesov

The chief engineer of the Kashira project, G. D.
Tsyurupa, reports shocking delays of cars in their dispatch from
Moscow to Kashira. There is red tape at the People’s
Commissariat for Railways.

With respect to the Kashira project, in view of its
exceptional importance for the state, there are a number
of the strictest directives on the extension of all kinds of
assistance and binding all the departments to carry out
assignments for the Kashira project with especial urgency
and especial care.

Please appoint the strictest inquiry into these delays, to
establish exactly who is to blame for the red tape, and
be sure to institute legal proceedings against the guilty
persons.

Carry out the inquiry in the most urgent manner.
Communicate the results to Comrade Smolyaninov for
reporting to
me.[1]

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The case involving red tape in the movement of freights for the
Kashira project was examined by a team of the People’s
Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. The guilty
persons were tried by the Revolutionary Military Tribunal.

Comrade Tsyurupa:

Having looked into the whole situation and the doctor’s
written orders, which you had shown
me,[1] etc., I most
insistently request you to take the following into
consideration.

I shall be unable to return before three or, perhaps, four
weeks. This is the most difficult period, and C.C. members
cannot set aside other business so as to take a most direct
part in C.P.C. and C.L.D. work. The doctor gave you
permission to work for 8 hours. I absolutely insist that over

    

the next four weeks you confine yourself to 4 hours
of work a day, and besides take a complete rest on
Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays. The rest of the time
should be spent on a sanatorium regimen, for which
purpose I expect to find a room in Sokolniki for you and your
wife, so that you may have your usual sick-nurse, good,
food, etc. I am quite sure that otherwise you will not be
able to stand the four weeks of work, and that is something
we need very badly because of the political situation. Of
these four hours, you must spend 2 hours a day in
attending the C.P.C. and C.L.D. meetings, which we shall hold
twice a week, the other two hours being devoted exclusively
to the signing of minutes and the necessary minimum of
conversation in person and by phone. If things are arranged
this way, our apparatus will not be weakened in any
way within these four weeks. You will be getting intensive
help on the technical side from Gorbunov and Smolyaninov,
and on the political side, from Kamenev and Stalin, and
I have already made arrangements with all of them. Once
again I ask you to accept this plan and to carry it out
punctiliously, because it is absolutely Utopian to hope to
protect your flat against an influx of friends from the
Commissariat for Food, etc.

Please send your reply through Fotieva as soon as
possible.[2]

21/I.22.

The same day, A. D. Tsyurupa replied to Lenin, thanking him          

for his care. He wrote that he was feeling better, and promised      

to carry out the doctor’s orders. He also said that he preferred     

to remain in the accustomed environment of his home where            

he had the necessary care, and promised “to go to Kashira or    

the Chaika country house for two or three days”.

Comrade Trotsky:

I have no doubt that the Mensheviks have now
intensified and will go on intensifying their most malicious
agitation. I think, therefore, that there is need to intensify
surveillance over and reprisals against them. I have already
spoken about this with Unschlicht, and request you to
find ten minutes or so for a conversation with him not by
telephone. As for the substance of the matter—I think I

    

agree with you. I now seem to be developing an urge to
write an article on topics close to those you have referred
to, but I shall nevertheless be hardly able to do this before
a fortnight is out. Therefore, it would be perhaps
extremely useful if you were to join open battle in the press right
away, naming this Menshevik, explaining the malicious
whiteguard character of his speech, and issuing an
impressive call to the Party to pull itself together. The term “state
capitalism” is, in my opinion (and I have repeatedly
argued with Bukharin about it), the only theoretically
correct and necessary one to make inert Communists realise
that the new policy is going forward in earnest. But, of
course, such malicious helpmates of the whiteguards, as
all Mensheviks are, can pretend that they do not understand
that state capitalism in a state with proletarian power
can exist only as limited in time and sphere of extension,
and conditions of its application, mode of supervision over
it,
etc.[2]

21/I–22

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is in reply to L. D. Trotsky’s communication that the
youth conference, where he had given a report, was addressed
by the Menshevik Gurvich, who, referring to Lenin’s
pronouncements on state capitalism, asserted that the New Economic
Policy was a return to capitalism.





[2]
Lenin shed light on the question of state capitalism in the
political report of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee and in the
summing up speech on the report at the Eleventh Party Congress,
and also in an interview with a Manchester Guardian
correspondent, in a report at the Fourth Congress of the Comintern, and
in his article “On Co-operation” (see present edition, Vol. 33,
pp. 279, 310–13, 402–04, 418–22, 472–73).

Sunday, 22/I.

Comrade Sokolnikov:

Concerning your letter of
18/I.[2]

About Basha and the State Depository of Valuables. I
very much fear that you have been carried away here by
the apparent “harmony” of the reorganisation plans.
Basha, who had been recommended to me by reliable men,
and who has proved his ability to safekeep, can (I felt)
only safekeep, safeguard and no more. That is enough. That
is a great deal. Under Trotsky’s general supervision and
pressure, let them safekeep, safeguard, fight stealing and
realise. That is enough. That is very much.

Why then “reorganise Gokhran”? Why reorganise it into
a “gold—currency—administration”?
 

I very much fear that reorganisation will be the death
of us, without bringing any of the practical jobs to
completion.

Let Trotsky and Basha carry out the State Depository
of Valuables job to the end: which is to collect, to
safeguard and to realise.

The currency administration must be separate. It was
in Litvinov’s charge. There is some mix-up between him
and Krasin—the most painful question which caused a
Politbureau decision a few days
ago.[3]

At all costs this mix-up should be eliminated and their
(Litvinov’s and Krasin’s) work made concerted swiftly,
immediately.

If Litvinov is unable to devote himself entirely to this
(because of the diplomacy), and if (you) intend to have
Krasnoshchekov head the currency administration, why not
bring this up before the Politbureau: the State Depository
of Valuables—safekeeps, collects and assigns for
realisation; Krasnoshchekov—currency administration (instead
of Litvinov or together with Litvinov?)?

I am in mortal fear of reorganisations. We are always
reorganising things, instead^ of getting on with the
practical business. You will do well to bear my words in mind:
if the Commissariat for Finance does have a bitter enemy,
it is the overdoing of reorganisation, and the underdoing
of the practical business.

I cannot agree with you that the restructuring of our
budget is at the centre of our work. Trade and restoration
of the ruble is at the centre.

It is true (as you write) that Larin is “undoubtedly”
the “father” of the monstrous confusion of the budget. It
is also true that Preobrazhensky is the second guilty one.
And what about O. Y. Schmidt? He has not got
Preobrazhensky’s excuses! This O. Y. Schmidt should be removed.
He is a most harmful fumbler, and is the more dangerous
because he fumbles with “pomposity” and is
“superklug”[1]

....

I think you should not engage in “restructuring” on the
question of the budget: hand nine-tenths of it to the State
Planning Commission and reduce all this to practical,

    

prudent amendments. Otherwise, the “restructuring” will
run away with you, and in any case it is impossible just
now, right away, to have a tolerable budget, and we shall
perish because of the collapse of the monetary system,
scattering our attention on tasks which are not feasible
just now.

At the centre of everything just now is trade, first,
domestic, and then, foreign trade; in connection with trade
and on the basis of trade—a restoration of the ruble.

All attention should be concentrated on this. The
important, the most important, the basic task is to make
a practical start on this.

Development of trade, organisation of the State Bank’s
trade department, to have it moving the whole of trade,
instead of sleeping—is the main thing.

What I mortally fear is that you, now actually in charge
of the most important People’s Commissariat, will be
carried away with restructuring, reorganisation, and the
theoretical line (you do have a weakness on this score)—
instead of practice, practice and practice: raising trade,
increasing and collecting taxes, restoring the ruble. Really
and truly I am in mortal fear of this; do not succumb to
this weakness, otherwise we shall collapse. Go on
promoting Krasnoshchekov: he appears to be a practitioner.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

In the letter here mentioned, G. Y. Sokolnikov argued the need      

to reorganise Gokhran (the State Depository of Valuables of the     

R.S.F.S.R.) into a Currency Administration. With this in mind,      

he suggested the appointment as its head an executive of greater    

stature than the head of Gokhran, N. A. Basha. Sokolnikov           

also dealt with various aspects of restructuring the budget.

To Comrade Molotov for circulating secretly
(without making a copy) all members of the Politbureau
together with Radek’s
letter[1]


I propose:

1) to adopt Radek’s proposal and to suggest right away
to Krasin and Krestinsky to put out feelers, in a circular

    

dispatch, with several powers separately (I once made this
proposal: I don’t understand why my written proposal
has been lost. It was sent to
Molotov[2]

).

2) To hasten Rakovsky’s arrival in Moscow and
departure for Prague (having him return here a fortnight
before Genoa).

3) To summon Krasin to Moscow by the same date.

4) To be highly careful and not to write abroad about
our plans concerning Genoa, even in code, and to put off
everything until the delegation conference in Moscow on
23.II (a fortnight before Genoa). This conference should
also be attended by Chicherin, Krasin and Rakovsky (and
Litvinov, and Vorovsky and Joffe, i.e., the whole delegation).

5) To issue a preliminary directive from the
Politbureau:

(a) under no circumstances shall we recognise any
debts, except those promised by
Chicherin[3];

(b) we shall recognise these debts only provided
they are covered by our own counter-claims;

(c) we give guarantees (if we are given a loan)
only with timber in the north, and so forth;

(d) we put the most extensive interpretation on
§ 1 of Bonomi’s
terms[4];

(e) we protect Germany and Turkey, etc.;

(f) we try to separate America, and in general to
divide the
powers.[5]

6) We instruct each member of the delegation to work
out on that basis a plan for negotiations in detail by 23.II.

7) I propose that we reverse the decision permitting
Chicherin to engage Sukhanov and
Jordansky.[6]

Radek is absolutely wrong.

The windbag Sukhanov will do nothing but harm.
Jordansky too. It is extremely harmful.

8) Considering that we here in Moscow are surrounded
by spies, Mensheviks and semi-Mensheviks, this (and
similar) proposals should not be entered into the Politbureau
minutes, but taken down separately, getting all the members
of the delegation to sign on the same sheet and to return
this sheet to Molotov, undertaking not to mention the

    

Politbureau directives anywhere, either in their papers,
or in coded messages.

January 23, 1922
To Comrade Lezhava

About the project for Harriman’s entry, let me tell you
the following: unless I am mistaken, the main provision
of the Derutra contract was that we and the Germans have
an equal number of votes on the board. If Harriman joined
up with the Germans, i.e., as part of the German half, that
would, of course, be acceptable, but if the Germans plus
Harriman have two-thirds of the votes, and we—one-third,
that is, of course, unacceptable. In that case, a second
society should be set up alongside Derutra, in which we and
Harriman would have an equal number of votes. In these
circumstances, the combined operations of the two societies
would fully ensure our interests and those of Harriman.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with a telegraphic inquiry addressed to
the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade by B. S.
Stomonyakov, the R.S.F.S.R. trade representative in Germany.
Reporting that HAPAG (Hamburg-America Line) had come to an
arrangement with the Harriman concern on transferring to the
latter one-half of its interest in the German-Russian Transport
Company (Derutra), Stomonyakov asked whether this should be
agreed to. A. M. Lezhava, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign
Trade, in a letter to Lenin on January 14, 1922, expressed the
opinion that this was advantageous not only for HAPAG but also
for Soviet Russia, because it was “a very major fact, the first
business agreement between us and American capital” (Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Derutra, the German-Russian Transport Company, was set up
on the basis of a protocol signed in Berlin on May 13, 1921, by

   

Stomonyakov and Director Theodor Ritter, a member of the
board of HAPAG (see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol. 
IV, Moscow, 1960, pp. 114–19).

Comrades Lezhava, Bogdanov
and Molotov (for Politbureau members)

January 23, 1922

I believe that it is absolutely necessary for us to accept
Krupp’s proposal just now, before the Genoa
Conference.[1]
It would be immensely important for us to conclude at

    

least one, and what would, be even Letter, several
concession contracts, with German firms above all. That is why
there must be the most relentless struggle against the
prejudice among the top section of the S.E.C. against
concessions, whether involving oil, agriculture or anything else.

      1
To Comrade Molotov
      (for Politbureau members)

I have just received two letters from Chicherin (dated
the 20th and 22nd). He has raised the question of whether
we should agree, for a proper compensation, to some small
changes in our Constitution, namely, representation for
the parasitic elements on the Soviets. He says this should
be done to please the Americans.

This proposal of Chicherin shows, I believe, that he
should
1) be immediately sent to a sanatorium, as any
connivance in this respect, any allowance of delay, etc., will,
in my opinion, be the greatest threat to all
negotiations.[1]

2) This shows how timely my proposal (which I here
enclose) is to have a formulation at once of our
preliminary and approximate, but precise terms, for all members
of the Genoa
delegation.[2]

To Comrade Molotov for all Politbureau members:

This and the following letter from Chicherin clearly
show that he is sick and very much
so.[3] We shall be fools
unless we force him to go to a sanatorium right away.

24/I.1922. Lenin

Written at the bottom of G. V. Chicherin’s letter of January 
20, 1922. Chicherin had written to Lenin: “... If the Americans
should harp on the demand for representative institutions, don’t
you think that it could be possible, for a sizable compensation,
to insert a small amendment into our Constitution...?” Lenin
underscored the words “could be possible” with four lines, put
three interrogation marks in the margin, and wrote: “This is
madness!!” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrades Kamenev and Stalin:

I have just learned—to my horror—from Sokolnikov that
he rejects (!) the Politbureau’s directive concerning the
trio (he + Preobrazhensky + Krasnoshchekov).

This is chaos!

This is a scandal!

This means that the C.C. apparatus is not working! This
should be reaffirmed not later than
tomorrow.[1]

And—I insist again and again—that no question should
be allowed to go to the Supreme Economic Commission
without the written proposals and counter-proposals of
the People’s Commissars and their deputies or assistants
concerned. Otherwise this is chaos, 


  red tape,


  empty talk,


irresponsibility.

Notes
 
 



[1]
On February 2, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
adopted a decision to the effect that questions having a
fundamental bearing on R.S.F.S.R. financial policy or going up for
decision by the Politbureau were to be examined beforehand by a
trio consisting of G. Y. Sokolnikov, A. M. Krasnoshchekov and
Y. A. Preobrazhensky.

People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade

Comrade Lezhava:

Comrade Lomonosov informs me that there has been fresh
delay with the ordering of turbines for the Volkhov project.

I propose that this question should be immediately
clarified and finally settled with Comrade Lomonosov, so
as to avoid the slightest delays in the future over a matter
that has been shockingly dragged out.

Send me the decision through Comrade Gorbunov not
later than 26/I.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade Chicherin:

1. Please send me, if possible, the official text of
Bonomi’s proposals in the language in which you have
received it (it is important for me to have the text of
the provisions as formulated by
them).[1]

2. Do you know if any influential Entente newspaper
has carried the text of Clause 1 of these terms, which was
initially published in our newspapers, namely: with the
words “system of property” and not just “system”, as, I
believe, the official text sent, by Bonomi puts
it.[2]

I should also ask you to have the Russian Telegraph
Agency’s Foreign Press Service check up whether the words
“system of property” have appeared in any foreign
newspaper, and if they have, to let me have the issue.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the radio telegram from the Chairman of the
Council of Ministers of Italy, Bonomi, on January 13, 1922, in which,
under a decision of the conference of the Allied Supreme Council,
held at Cannes from January 6 to 13, he invited, on behalf of the
Supreme Council, a Soviet Government delegation to take part
in an international economic and financial conference which was
to meet at Genoa in early March 1922.





[2]

Clause 1 of the Cannes resolution, as published in the
Soviet press, said: “No state can claim any right to dictate to
another state the principles on which the latter is to regulate its
system of ownership, and internal economy and government”
(Izvestia VTsIK No. 6, January 10, 1922). This text
corresponded with the text of the resolution published in Petit
Parisien No. 16385 on January 8. On January 26, G. V. Chicherin
wrote, enclosing the issue of the paper: “I am sending you Petit
Parisien with the Cannes resolution and a copy of Bonomi. The
latter has dropped ‘Système de propriété’.”

Lenin attached great importance to the formulation of § 1 of
the Cannes terms, regarding it as an indirect admission of the
bankruptcy of the capitalist system of property, and of the
inevitable existence of a communist system of property alongside it.
Lenin pointed out that the other paragraphs of the Cannes terms,
designed to enslave Soviet Russia by foreign capital, were clearly
at odds with clause one (see present edition, Vol. 33,
pp. 356–57).

Comrade Smilga


Copies to Comrades N. P. Gorbunov


and Smolyaninov

For considerations not only economic but also political,
it is absolutely necessary for us to have a concession with
the Germans at Grozny, and if possible, at other fuel
centres as well. If you sabotage this, I am going to regard it
as a downright crime. We must act quickly to have some
positive results before Genoa. Please reply. Briefly by
telegram, details by
letter.[2]

Notes
 

[1]
Typed on top of the text is the following: “Send in code through 
 Krestinsky, with P. P. Gorbunov’s special concern for accurate 
 delivery.”—Ed.
 



[2]
On January 31, 1922, I. T. Smilga, reporting his and B. S.
Stomonyakov’s talk with representatives of the Deutsche Bank
about oil concessions, wrote: “...We have agreed in principle to
negotiate on the whole of Grozny and on the Bibi-Eibat district in
Baku.” Smilga requested instructions about the term of the talks.
In order to expedite this matter, Smilga suggested that the right
to sign the agreement should be vested in him, N. N. Krestinsky,
A. I. Rykov and B. S. Stomonyakov, with subsequent
confirmation by the C.P.C. The letter was also signed by Krestinsky
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of
the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

26/I.1922.

Comrade Chicherin:

Do you remember sending me Sun Yat-sen’s letter?

The one in which he said something about his friendship
for me, and you asked me whether I knew him?

Was the letter addressed to you or to
me?[1]

Have you got it in the archives? and my reply with your
inquiry?

If you do, could you send it to me (addressed to Fotieva)?

If not, what do you remember about it?

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Sun Yat-sen’s letter of August 28, 1921, addressed      

to G. V. Chicherin, informing him of the situation in China,           

and of Sun’s election to the post of President of the National         

Government. He ended by saying: “I am taking a great interest         

in your cause, especially in the organisation of your Soviets, your    

Army and education. I should like to know everything you and           

others may tell me about these things, especially about education.     

Like Moscow, I should like to lay the foundations of the Chinese       

Republic deep in the minds of the young generation—the toilers       

of the morrow.

“With best wishes to you, to ray friend Lenin and to all those                

who have done so much for the cause of human freedom” (see                    

Bolshevik No. 19, 1950, pp. 46–48). Having sent on this letter to    

Lenin on November 6, 1921. Chicherin asked him whether he was                  

personally acquainted with Sun Yat-sen. Lenin replied the next                 

day, saying that they had never met, and that until then they                  

had not corresponded.

26/I.1922.

Comrade Glyasser:

It is absolutely necessary that I have all the minutes
of the Politbureau (and the
“Duet”)[1]

at the proper time

  and in full order.

Order means completeness:

(a) all minutes

(b) all papers in each set of minutes, and not
references to absent letters, “proposals”, remarks, etc.

Make sure to arrange everything with Burakova and with
anyone else concerned, 

put everything in order (and get all the lacking
documents in) 

all the minutes during my absence (this means
from
6.XII.1921?[2]) 

and send me everything.

I enclose the minutes.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Duet—two members of the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) Central    

Committee who outlined its agenda, gave a preliminary reading               

of the material for the sittings, and in some cases submitted their         

conclusions.





[2]
Lenin was given leave under a Politbureau decision on December     

3, 1921; he was away on leave from December 6.

Publicity for revolutionary tribunals should not be a
rule; their panels should be augmented by “your” men, and
their ties (of all sorts) with the All-Russia Cheka
strengthened; the force and speed of their reprisals should be
intensified and the C.C.’s attention to this increased. The
slightest increase in banditry, etc., should entail martial
law and shootings on the spot. The C.P.C. will be able
to pass this swiftly, if you look sharp, and it could be done
by phone.

Also have a talk with Stalin, and if you consider it
necessary, show Him this
letter.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This is in reply to a letter from I. S. Unschlicht, Deputy
Chairman of the All-Russia Cheka, of January 26, 1922, in which he
stood up for the new draft statute of the All-Russia Cheka, worked
out by its Collegium, and insisted that it should retain its
punitive functions. The letter is quoted in his reminiscences of Lenin,
He sets out the beginning of the letter as follows: “Lenin did not
agree with my arguments and sent me a reply saying that my
proposals could and should be realised not my way but through a
C.C. commission draft.... Lenin ended his letter by noting that on
the basis of the decisions taken by a Politbureau commission ‘an
increase in the speed and force of reprisals can and must be
achieved’” (Voprosy istorii KPSS, 1965, No. 4, p. 97). See also

Comrade Gorbunov:

Either you or Smolyaninov must keep this matter under
special supervision. This is very important. Make a file
of everything relevant (the C.L.D. bonus decision, etc.).
Have a talk with Lomonosov. He and Krzhizhanovsky and
others will hold a meeting at Gosplan on
Wednesday.[1]

The

    

minutes must be in your hands. Let me know the result. I
have read this to Krzhizhanovsky. He says that the
competition and Lomonosov’s plan do not exclude each other.

29/I. Lenin

P.S. I believe Styunkel has some material about this.
Someone should be collecting all the scientific literature on
this question.

 February 1.—Ed.
 



[2]
This is written on a telephone message from Y. V. Lomonosov
to Lenin on January 28, 1922 (see Note 550).

On February 3, 1922, Chairman of the State Planning Commission,
G. M. Krzhizhanovsky, submitted a detailed memo giving Lenin a
progress report on implementing the C.L.D. decision of January 1,
1922, concerning diesel locomotives (see Note 500).

He believed that it was necessary, along with building diesel
locomotives to Russian blueprints, to announce an international
competition. He wrote that the work was being carried on in two
directions: the drafting of the terms of the international
competition and the “working out of outline blueprints of diesel
locomotives for their subsequent construction through the allocation
of orders to factories” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

On March 10, 1922, the C.L.D. approved the terms of the
competition for the construction of diesel locomotives for the R.S.F.S.R.,
which had been worked out by the State Planning Commission
together with the Thermal Technical Institute and the People’s
Commissariat for Railways, and set March 1, 1924, as the date of the
competition (see this volume, Documents 568 and 611).

To Comrade Molotov
for Politbureau members

I quite agree with
Trotsky.[1]

I propose:

1) Radek should be censured for giving in to the
Mensheviks.

2) The reprisals against the Mensheviks should be
intensified, and our courts should be instructed to
intensify them.

3) Accept this proposal of Trotsky’s.

4) Authorise Trotsky to accelerate in every way a
fierce attack on the Mensheviks over
Georgia.[2]

30/I.1922. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On January 29, 1922, the newspapers carried two radio messages
from the Italian Foreign Minister Torretta addressed to G. V.
Chicherin, one dated January 22, containing a reply to
Chicherin’s inquiry about the agenda of the Genoa Conference, and the
other dated January 27, on the composition of the conference.
In the latter he said that, in accordance with the Cannes decisions
of the Supreme Council, among those invited to the conference
were “apart from the members of the Supreme Council and
Russia, all the stales of Europe with de jure recognition” (Dokumenty
vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol. V, Moscow, 1961, p. 59). This
“explanation” of Torretta’s was taken by some quarters to imply the
invitation to the conference of the expelled whiteguard governments
of Kolchak and Denikin, the Menshevik government of Georgia,

   

the Dashnak government of Armenia, the Musavat government of
Azerbaijan and others (which had earlier been recognised by the
Entente, and whose recognition had not been revoked). In this
context, L. D. Trotsky proposed a categorical declaration
saying that the invitation of émigré counter-revolutionary
organisations would make it quite impossible for the R.S.F.S.R. to attend
such a conference.





[2]
The Menshevik leaders were carrying on a malicious campaign
of lies and slander against Soviet Russia, accusing her of
violating “democracy”, “the self-determination of nations”,
expulsion of the “legitimate” (Menshevik) government of Georgia, and
“occupation” of her territory, etc. In view of the forthcoming
Genoa Conference, the Mensheviks intensified their attacks on the
R.S.F.S.R., demanding the Red Army’s withdrawal from
Georgia, the staging there of a referendum, etc. The
Mensheviks in Russia were supported by émigré Mensheviks.

Lenin’s proposals published here were adopted by the
Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.

Top secret

Comrade Zinoviev

I received only today your letter in reply to my
application sent in many days ago about withdrawing my
report.[1]

You are entirely to blame for this incredible red tape.
I find it ridiculous to read that you cannot see your way
to agreeing to the withdrawal of my report on the
economic situation. Unfortunately, my illness cannot accord
with this. Unless you prepare another rapporteur in good
time, the blame will fall entirely on you. I have not
received any reply to my proposal to let Pyatakov give this
report, although I made this proposal to Kamenev and you
many days
ago.[2]

I began writing an article on this subject,
but I now see that I can in no way guarantee its completion
in
time.[4] You are certainly right about the Mensheviks
that the reply must he absolutely negative. I think that
you, too, are at fault on this point with unwarranted
indulgence. For instance, it was decided not to release
Rozhkov. But he has been released without any  Politbureau
decision.[5] I think that nothing but harm will come of
such a policy.

Lenin

[3]
On January 31, 1922, Lenin received G. Y. Zinoviev’s reply to
his letter of January 26 (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian)
Edition, Vol. 54, Document 232). Zinoviev wrote that the Executive
Committee of the Comintern, not expecting Lenin to deliver a
speech on the question of a united front, wanted to have an article
by him on this subject. As for his speech on the question of NEP
and its initial results, it was considered highly important by the
Executive Committee of the Comintern in view of the fact that
the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals were distorting
the meaning of NEP and agitating against the Communists. See
this volume, Document 617.





[4]
Lenin did not write a special article on NEP or the country’s
economic position. He dealt with these questions in the first part
of his article “Notes of a Publicist”, which remained unfinished
(see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 204–07).





[5]
Prof. N. A. Rozhkov was arrested in February 1921 as a member
of the Petrograd Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. (Mensheviks). At
his interrogation he said that while he shared the Menshevik
view of the Soviet power’s inevitable debacle, he did not wish to
take part in the political struggle and intended to withdraw from
the Menshevik Party. In this connection, the Petrograd
Gubernia Cheka suggested his release. On May 31, 1921, the Politbureau
of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. decided not to release him.

Rozhkov was later released under a decision of the Presidium
of the All-Russia Cheka. See also this volume, Documents 801
and 802.

31/I.

Comrade Unschlicht,

I am quite unable to be in the
Politbureau.[1] I am
feeling worse.
 

I believe you can do without me.

The whole point now is the purely technical measures
leading to our courts intensifying (and making swifter)
reprisals against the Mensheviks.

Both the courts and the C.P.C. or the All-Russia C.E.C.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau

Since Zinoviev insists on my fulfilling the assignment
of the Comintern’s Executive Committee to give a report
on the New Economic Policy at an enlarged sitting of the
Comintern Executive Committee on 12–II, and since I am
quite unable to do this, because I am
unwell,[1]

as I have
repeatedly told Zinoviev, I request the Politbureau to
resolve:

1) To take into consideration Lenin’s statement that he
is quite unable, because of illness, to fulfil the Executive
Committee’s assignment.

2) To authorise the Russian members of the Executive
Committee to cancel the decision appointing Lenin’s
report.

3) To authorise the said members of the Executive
Committee to have Comrade Pyatakov appointed rapporteur
on this subject.

4) To put on Pyatakov the duty to prepare, not later
than next Sunday, first, detailed theses of his report,
second, an outline of his report and a summary of the
principal figures which are to be cited in the report, and to have

    

Pyatakov conform his theses to those submitted by Lenin
to the Third Congress of the Comintern, and earlier approved
by the Party
C.C.[2]


5) To authorise Comrades Zinoviev, Bukharin and Lenin
to correct and make a final editing of Pyatakov’s theses
and his outline report.

6) To have Pyatakov make his report about an hour long,
at most one hour and a half.

7) To instruct Comrade Pyatakov to cite the most
concise principal figures showing the successful development
of industry and trade under the New Economic Policy,
and the significance of this for rehabilitating the Republic’s
economy.

8) To take into consideration Lenin’s statement that
if his health allows him, he will attend Pyatakov’s report
and will take the floor after him for a short supplementary
statement or communication, not in the nature of a
report.[3]

Comrade Bukharin

1. I am surprised and indignant at not having heard a
single word from you in reply to my telephone message on a
joint conference with the II and II 1/2
Internationals.[1]
Such things should be answered at least in a couple of words
without delay.

2. Could you arrange for me to have someone who is a
regular reader of European newspapers and those of the II
and II 1/2 Internationals to draw up for me a very short list

    

(not more than two pages for newspapers in each language)
of arguments used by them over our New Economic Policy.
It would be enough for me to have such a list separately
from the German, French and English papers, but only,
I repeat, in the shortest telegraphic style, not more than
two pages for each of these languages.

Please
reply.[2]

Only

to Comrade Stalin and Comrade Kamenev

Please have a look at this short report from Sokolnikov,
which he has given me in reply to my inquiry of yesterday.
First, the report is incomplete, arid I have demanded
additional
information,[1]

second, if it is correct, the
implication is that Novitsky has been giving us downright
incorrect figures. We must find out the whole truth on this
matter, and, if it turns out that Novitsky gave us incorrect

    

figures, the question must be raised in the Politbureau of
prosecuting him.

       Comrade Molotov

Comrade Molotov:

The papers say that an emergency conference of heads of
gubernia and regional public education departments has
been set for 20/III. I think that the following circular
telegram, signed by you and me, should be issued:

“Every gubernia and regional department of public
education is hereby bound to send in with their delegate or
by mail for the conference precise and detailed information
about outstanding local public educators of gubernia
departments. This should include the delegates to the

    

conference. Information about each should contain his
detailed record before the revolution and since, and a reference
from local gubernia executive committees and local
Gubernia Party Committees. The number of workers to
be covered by such information—at least 2 Party and 2 
non-Party men for each gubernia.

“Non-fulfilment or improper fulfilment of this proposal
shall entail responsibility in Party and Soviet government
procedures.”[1]

In addition to this telegram, I propose the demand that
Comrade Litkens should also submit reports on at least 10 
workers of the People’s Commissariat for Public Education
among those who have been most outstanding at the centre
in the last few years or months.

I consider all these reports to be absolutely necessary,
because the People’s Commissariat for Education has
been quite incapable of enlisting workers from the
localities, whereas we must find candidates for it to renew
the Collegium.

7/II.

Comrade Chicherin:

All your numerous assumptions are, I think, basically
incorrect and spring, so to say, from polemical
ardour.[2]

The directives do not say that we should not agree to
cover in any form whatsoever any random claims of the
adversary with our own counter-claims.

The chairman of the delegation (and the deputy chairman,
in this case) seems to have a host of powers, which gives
him almost autocratic power.

Your letter (and Krasin’s even more so) shows—rather
showed—signs of panic. That is the most dangerous thing.
We are not the least bit afraid of a break-down: we shall
have an even better conference tomorrow. Isolation and
blockade will no longer intimidate us, nor will
intervention.

We are proposing a broad agenda, and are hinting at our
own “palliative” programme of general measures.

Suppose they reject it?

As they please! (we might publish our extensive
programme on behalf of some member of the delegation,
who may even resign (with the C.C.’s consen, of
course).

You do not want an extensive one, let’s have a narrower
one: Wir nehmen auch
Abschlagszahlung![1]


We shall accept even the narrowest one, but we shall not
accept anything disadvantageous. We shall not submit to
ultimatums. If you want only “to trade”—let’s have it,
but we shall not buy a pig in a poke, and will not make
any deal without calculating any “claims” to the last
kopek.

That is all.
 

We must prepare and deploy all our guns—there will
always be time enough to decide which are to he used as a
show, and which are to be fired off and when.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Gorbunov:

Give this the most serious
attention.[1] I think, we should
allow everything that is asked; i.e. 4 m.r. X O.2 (?)
800,000 million. That is the first thing.

Second. Do not separate from the Central Board for the
Peat Industry (since Radchenko is not here, ask Morozov
and Menshikov). Why separate? The need is to give
autonomy inside the Central Board for the Peat Industry.
It should be defined precisely, in writing, and established
through the C.L.D.

Third. There is, after all, a number of C.L.D. decisions
on priority for the Administration for Hydraulic Peat
Extraction, etc., etc. These have been definitely “forgotten”.
That is a scandal! Those who are guilty of
“forgetfulness” should be found and prosecuted. Without fail! (Let
me know the result: what has been done.)

Copy to Comrade A. D. Tsyurupa

Comrade Sokolnikov:

1) Gorbunov has told you about Belov. We have the
best references about Belov both on the Party side and on
the commercial side. I feel that unless we give support to
our “own” businessmen of this caliber, we shall be doing
nothing but talk and talk. Those guilty of delays and red
tape (at the State Bank) must be punished. Otherwise there
will be no results. (Gorbunov has the references.)

2) The foreign trade theses have been pickled. A long,
long time ago, I gave this two or three days.

Such delays should not be allowed to go unpunished.

3) Has any thought been given to the ways and means of
bringing to book members of trust boards for incorrect
accounting and for operating business at a
loss[1]

?

I wonder
if our People’s Commissariat for Justice is asleep? This
calls for a number of model trials with the application of
the fiercest chastisement. It looks as though the P.C.J.
has failed to realise that the New Economic Policy demands
new modes of the greater infliction of fiercer penalties.

4) In Smolensk Gubernia private capital is said to have
beaten the co-operative?, and driven them to closure.

What about prosecutions for illegal trade?


What about taxes on private trade? etc., etc.

The Soviet, bureaucrats have also missed all this?

Who at your place is responsible for this? Perhaps, we
should set up commissions 

1) from the People’s Commissariat for
Finance

2)  ”  ”  People’s Commissariat for
Justice measures

3) anyone else 

}}
for supervision

    

and reprisals for
incorrect trade,
etc,?[2]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Yenukidze:

From talks and reports here in Moscow, I conclude that
there is something like slackness in the Presidium of the
All-Russia C.E.C. and its work. This is not surprising,
because all its members are loaded with 20 jobs, as is the
practice in our
“Oblomov”[1]

republic.

This tends to strengthen the influence of men like Larin.
He is a good fellow—as poet, as journalist, as lecturer. But
we are fools to appoint him to legislative work, thereby
spoiling and ruining both him and the job.

For Christ’s sake, keep a stricter watch over him. Keep
Larin in check. If he has already got somewhere, do not
believe any of his plans or projects—do not let any pass
without a triple check-up.

See that there is not the usual chaos, when efforts are
made to get something through the Presidium of the
All-Russia C.E.C. (by means of half-truths) in circumvention
of the C.P.C. and the State Planning Commission.

Keep both your eyes peeled, and inform me (or Stalin
with Kamenev) in good time.

Two other points:

1) Stalin’s flat. Well, when? What red tape!

2) Lalayants. How is he? If he is going to Siberia, I
must give him a letter and arrange a place for him in the
car through Sklyansky and Fomin.

Regards,

Yours,


Lenin
 

P.S. I have just sent you a paper about flats for
Strumilin and Ramzin. Please do your Lest about this, get it
done, and write
me.[2]

Yours,

Lenin

to go and fetch his family at the end of March (after the Party
Congress). Yenukidze also asked Lenin to see him about the work
of the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C. Yenukidze later
reported that he had written to V. V. Fomin at the People’s
Commissariat for Railways about carriage arrangements for
Lalayants.

On the first page of Yenukidze’s letter, Lenin wrote: “To
Fotieva p. 3”, and on the third page—“check up fulfilment of § 3”,
in which he underscored with a double line the words “about
flats for Strumilin and Ramzin” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee),

14.II.1922

Comrade Molotov:

Having filled in the questionnaire or the form of the
last census of R.C.P.
members,[1] I have come to the
firm conclusion that the business of statistics at the C.C.
(and probably, the whole of the registration and
distribution) is very poorly organised.

Either we have a fool in charge of statistics, or there
are fools and pedants sitting in important posts somewhere
in these “departments” (if the said institutions under the
C.C. are so called), and you have apparently no time to
look into what they are doing.

1. The head of the Statistical Department should be fired.

2. This and the Registration and Distribution
departments must be given a thorough shake-up.

Otherwise, we ourselves (“combating red tape”...) breed the
most disgraceful and stupid red tape under our very noses.

The C.C. has vast powers. Its possibilities are gigantic.
We are distributing 200,000–400,000 Party workers, and
through them thousands upon thousands of non-Party men.

And this gigantic communist undertaking is being dead
ruined by stupid red tape!

All the censuses must be finished in a month.

Their processing should be reduced to a minimum, so as
also to complete it within a month.

After that nine-tenths of the Statistical and an equal
proportion of the Registration and Distribution departments

    

of the C.C. should be disbanded, and their organisation
started anew.

You yourself should get rid of minor problems (shift
them on to your assistants and assistants’ assistants) to
concentrate entirely on the business of being a political
secretary and superintendent directing the work of
organisation, registration, etc.

Has there been a census of “responsible workers”? The
result likewise appears to be a zero; it is worse, probably
being a minus.

Write or phone me, and we shall talk it over in greater
detail.

We need cards for several hundred (for a start) leading
Party workers, classifying them as propagandists,
administrators, agitators, teachers, etc., and containing
references about their work (say, a record of the last five posts)
given by such-and-such (4–6) persons. We have been chasing
after thousands and hundreds of thousands, trifling our time
away bureaucratically, without learning to place these men.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

A reference to the All-Russia census of the R.C.P.(B.) members
in early 1922, for the purpose of establishing the membership
composition and making an exact count of Party members. In
Moscow it was held from February 6, 1922. For the questionnaire
filled in by Lenin see present edition, Vol. 42, pp. 457–61.

The census of responsible workers mentioned in the letter was
carried out in July 1921 to determine the number and
qualifications of the governing section of the Party in gubernia and uyezd
centres, their territorial distribution and efficiency of use.

   To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau

I propose that we resolve:

1) Not a word about the amount or categories of our
counter-claims.

Write about the counter-claims in general;

2) in general write about the conference and about our
pacifist programme as well.

(Write ==
print.)[1]

Notes
 
 



[1]
This proposal was written at the bottom of G. V. Chicherin’s letter
of February 11, 1922, to the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
Chicherin objected to L. D. Trotsky’s instructions that, in
connection with preparations for the international economic and
financial conference (Genoa Conference), experts of the military
department should discuss in the press concrete material and the amount
of counter-claims on the capitalist countries for compensation of
the losses inflicted on Soviet Russia by the foreign armed
intervention and blockade.

On February 15, 1922, the Politbureau adopted Lenin’s
proposal.

February 14, 1922

Comrade Kursky:

Please let me have, at the earliest possible date, an
official report about the powers the Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection has, under the legislation in force, concerning
the inspection of private (non-state) enterprises.

I recall It being repeatedly said that the W.P.I.’s
powers should not be restricted in any way as to any
enterprises whatsoever which do not fall into the category of
state enterprises.

This letter to D. I. Kursky and the documents given below
(see this volume, Document 657), as well as Lenin’s markings
on the draft decision of the All-Russia C.E.C. on the People’s
Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection and his
letter to J. V. Stalin on this question (see this volume, Document 
659), were written in view of the need to legislate more precisely
on the lights of the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and
Peasants’ Inspection to control the activity of private enterprises.
This is due to a revival of private enterprises under the New
Economic Policy, a growth in the number of transactions between
state organisations and private lessees and various types of
abuses on that account,

15.II.1922

Comrade Chicherin:

A telegram from Krasin dated 13.II (File No. 1466/c)
says (Lloyd George): “If the Soviet Government refuses to
recognise the Cannes resolutions that will threaten the
break-down of the entire conference and will, in any case,
make it easier for Poincare to walk out....”

That is formulated more “threateningly” than accurately!

But the whole British press, judging by our papers, has
made frequent statements to the effect that the invitation
to the Genoa Conference does not require and never has
required the preliminary acceptance of the Cannes terms and
that the contrary opinion held by the French is an
incorrect one.

All the material must be collected to establish precise
and formally indisputable facts.

It seemed to me that three facts were indisputable:

(1) when we were invited it was not required that we
make a precise, clear and formal declaration of acceptance
of the Cannes terms;
 

(2) we did not make any such declaration in our reply,
and we have not been informed that our reply is incomplete;

(3) the entire British bourgeois press in its dispute with
the French recognised that the preliminary acceptance of
the Cannes’ terms is not obligatory.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Kursky:

I enclose Koblents’s reply to
me.[1]

After reading, please,
return to N. P. Gorbunov:

1) I very strongly suspect that Koblents is poor, and
that the whole of this department is poor too.

Koblents has clearly “forgotten” that an enterprise leased
from the Soviet power is still a Soviet enterprise;

2) ——confused the question about subsequent or
preliminary audit with the question of whether or not it is liable
to auditing at all;

3) he has apparently “forgotten” that the rights of the
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection are not narrower than
the State Control’s old powers (Collection of Statutes, 1920,
No. 16); he has forgotten many other things as well.

Conclusion: Koblents’s opinion must be checked up, and
if a careful study shows that Koblents has told a lie, he
should be replaced by a more solid lawyer.

Let me know whom you will appoint as responsible for
this check-up.

———If our laws are “contradictory” (of which there is
no doubt), what are the People’s Commissariat for Justice
and the Legislative Proposals Department for?
 

What then is being done towards codification?—towards
removal of contradictions?

In particular, this is just the time for urgently working
out a clear and precise law on the extension of the W.P.I.’s
powers to audit and inquire to all manner of establishments
and enterprises (private, co-operative, concession, etc.).

Let me know who will be given this assignment.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade N. P. Gorbunov:

Please read this and make a note of it for yourself to
keep an eye on execution.

Have this typed and sent to Comrade
Kursky.[2]

The following day, February 16, 1922, D. I. Kursky replied
to Lenin’s letter, informing him that be had instructed V. I.

   

Yakhontov, member of the Collegium of the People’s
Commissariat for Justice and head of the Codification Department, to
verify I. G. Koblents’s conclusion. Kursky wrote about the draft
Statute of Obligations, Criminal Code, etc., which had been
submitted for approval by the C.P.C., and about the elaboration of
a number of laws at the People’s Commissariats for Agriculture,
Labour, and Justice. He admitted that there were contradictions
in the existing laws. Sharing Lenin’s view on the “need to
guarantee the state full auditing and control”, Kursky wrote that he
would “consider highly useful a C.C. directive in this respect
for the Narrow C.P.C...” (underlined by Lenin) (see Lenin
Miscellany XXXV, p. 326).

non-departmental (Belov + ?)

2) appropriations under the state estimates, first, to the
People’s Commissariat for Finance and the Workers’
and Peasants’ Inspection;

to the Narrow C.P.C. only by way of protest;
the rest, as you have it.

Think over once again and set down in writing these
principles for reducing the Narrow C.P.C., obtain the
opinion of the Narrow C.P.C. Chairman, get these principles
through the Politbureau, and then swiftly elaborate them
into a new statute.
 

Perhaps the commissions should also be reduced? their
role in actual verification enhanced? all the work
subordinated directly to the deputies of the C.L.D. Chairman?

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On December 1, 1921, having heard Lenin’s report on
A. D. Tsyurupa’s work, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
decided to confirm him in the post of Second Deputy Chairman of the
C.L.D., and on December 5 he was appointed Deputy Chairman
of the C.P.C. by a Politbureau decision.

The country’s transition :o peaceful economic construction
made it necessary to improve and restructure the whole Soviet
state apparatus. The programme for this was set out in the
letters to A. D. Tsyurupa (see present edition, Vol. 35, Documents 
307, 308, 309 and 310).





[2]
This document is written in connection with A. D. Tsyurupa’s
letter reporting the shortcomings in the work of the Narrow
C.P.C.

Tsyurupa proposed that the Narrow C.P.C. should be reduced
from 22 to 5 persons: a chairman and four representatives of
departments (People’s Commissariat for Justice, People’s
Commissariat for Finance, Supreme Economic Council, and People’s
Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection). All
matters relating to appropriations, provided for in the state
estimates, were to go to the People’s Commissariat for Finance, and
went to the Narrow C.P.C. only by way of protest against the acts
of the Commissariat. The Narrow C.P.C. examined the questions
provided for by the order.

Comrade Yakovenko,


People’s Commissariat for Agriculture

On January 26, Izvestia VTsIK carried an article by
Comrade A. Belyakov entitled “Yearning Motors and
Proletarian Agriculture”.

I advise you to give serious attention to this item. It
turns out that 770 brand new motors with spare parts, in
good condition, in their foreign packaging, with a total
of almost 117,000 h.p., and costing over 14 million pre-war
gold rubles, have been lying about at the war department
for five years. These motors are of no use to the War
Department, and are being handed over by it to the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture, which can very well use
them for the needs of agriculture. It is four months now
since the P.C.A. has been informed of this, bat not a thing
has yet been done, apart from exchanges on paper.

This is sheer mismanagement and helplessness.

I propose that:

1. the P.C.A. should give me a written explanation;

2. those guilty of delays and red tape should be found,
and a trial of this business should be arranged with wide
publicity;

3. this thing should at once be got going in practice
most, resolutely, informing me within a month of what has
been actually done (when the motors were accepted, how

    

used, to whom handed over, when and how they will start
operating,
etc.).[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In reply to this letter, People’s Commissar for Agriculture, V. G.
Yakovenko, informed Lenin on February 21, 1922, that he had
ordered an inquiry in connection with A. A. Belyakov’s article
in Izvestia VTsIK. Yakovenko wrote that he had handed over
the material on this to D. I. Kursky at the People’s
Commissariat for Justice to have proceedings started against those guilty
of red tape, if he found this necessary.

On May 15, 1922, Yakovenko submitted to Lenin a report on
the use of the aeroengines for mechanising agriculture (Central
Party Archives of thy Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Kursky

Copy to Comrade Tsyurupa


 ”  to Comrade Gorbunov

Comrade Kursky:

I am unable to have a look at the draft decree on bills
of exchange and civil obligations. I think it is absolutely
necessary for us to have in this law complete guarantees
of the rights of our state not only to full audit and control,
but also to annulment on serious state grounds. Please let
me have your opinion on this matter (a few lines, not more
than one page) and send me two or three extracts of articles
giving us such guarantees. I conclude from Comrade
Gorbunov’s words that there must be such articles in the
draft.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In a letter to Lenin on February 16, 1922, D. I. Kursky wrote
that the guarantee of the state’s rights provided for in the
articles of the general pact of the Statute of Obligations, which
specified the cases when contracts were invalid, and in the article
of the draft Statute of the Administration of State Enterprises,
which laid down that there could be no adjudication from the
fixed capital of a state enterprise; in addition, the draft Criminal
Code contained an article “inflicting punishment for
mismanagement by a stale enterprise manager of the business assigned to
him”. Kursky wrote: “As a preventive measure there is need for
control by the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection and
specification of the statute of the W.P.I.’s right to audit the leased
enterprises, for which there is already a C.C. assignment” (Central
Party Archives of the institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee). See also, this volume, Documents 
629 and 657.

Please show Stalin and Molotov and send on to Chicherin
this reply of mine:

Comrade Chicherin!

You are letting your nerves run away with you. We
shall still have time on 22 or 23/11 to discuss the plan of
conduct at Genoa.

You and I have both fought against pacifism as a
programme for the revolutionary proletarian party. That much

    

is clear. But who has ever denied the use of pacifists by
that party to soften up the enemy, the
bourgeoisie?[1]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written under the text of G. V. Chicherin’s letter of February 
15, 1922. With the directives of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. and Lenin’s
instructions in mind concerning the nature of the programme with
which the Soviet delegation was to come out at the Genoa
Conference (see this volume, Document 623, and also present edition,
Vol. 42, pp. 396–98), Chicherin wrote: “I don’t know how we
shall manage with the ‘broadest programme’. All my life I have
cursed petty-bourgeois illusions, and here is the Politbureau
making me invent petty-bourgeois illusions in my old age. None
of us knows how to compose such things, we don’t even know on
which sources we are to rely. Perhaps you will let us have more
detailed directions?” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee.)

Comrade Litkens

Copy to the Narrow C.P.C.

At the end of last December, I wrote to the People’s
Commissariat for Education about Prof. Krug’s request
to provide the Moscow Higher Technical College with
premises for its electrotechnical department and
Electrotechnical Institute, and asked that special attention should be
given to it, and everything done to meet the
request.[1]


On February 9, I received another letter from Prof. Krug,
in which he says that the People’s Commissariat for
Education has not yet helped the College. Prof. Krug says that
it would be quite possible, without causing any
inconvenience at all, by way of more efficient use of space by
others, to give the electrotechnical department and the
Experimental Electrotechnical Institute some of the
premises of the former Yelizavetinsky Institute, and have
the Radishchev School, now housed at the Institute,
transferred to another place by the spring, when the warm
weather sets in.

If you do not agree with this proposal of Prof. Krug’s—I
instruct you on your personal responsibility to find and
make available to the Institute premises within a
fortnight.

Inform me of execution by March 3.

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

To Comrade Molotov for Politbureau members


Copy to Comrade Osinsky

Comrade Osinsky writes to me to say that the
Politbureau has cancelled all sorts of credits made available
in addition to the initial budget, and that the credits to
the Shatilov Oats Trust have also been cancelled. I have
made a point of looking into this business, and I must
say that according to my information this is an
exceptionally important undertaking which must be supported by
way of exception at any cost. Unfortunately, Osinsky does
not give the figures in question. Please obtain from Osinsky,
Sokolnikov and Tsyurupa a short report, running to
a few lines, about this matter by tomorrow morning, and
have another examination of this question at the
Politbureau tomorrow, summoning Osinsky to attend in the
event the data submitted by Comrades Tsyurupa and
Sokolnikov do not clear up the question entirely.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin believed the work of the Shatilov Oats Trust in improving
plant crops to be of great importance for the stale, because he
regarded it as a way of increasing agricultural productivity.
On the strength of Lenin’s proposal, the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C., on February 18, 1922, reviewed the question
of issuing a long-term loan to the Shatilov Trust, and adopted
a decision to give it financial support. On March 4, the
Politbureau put the duly on the People’s Commissariat for Finance
to let the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture have funds for
the Shatilov Trust.

The Trust was set up on the basis of the Shatilov
Agricultural Experimental Station, founded in 1896. Today, it is the Orel
State Agricultural Experimental Station, a scientific research
establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture of the R.S.F.S.R.

18/II.

Comrade Tsyurupa:

When I was writing my book on
imperialism,[1]

I read
about two systems for state banks (and banks in general)
in the capitalist countries. One of the systems—the State
Bank’s great proximity to trade.

Perhaps we should get a couple of our “fin-scholars”
(I feel like making a pun—fie-scholars?) to make a study
of this question.

We need a State Bank which is a hundred times closer
to trade than the most commercial of the state banks of
capitalism. Our State Bank must have a network of
commercial agents, starting from the top (something like a
travelling bank inspector for commerce, in charge of
thousands of millions in turnover) and ending with small and
very small commercial agents at the bottom If this whole
network operates on the commission system and learns
(and teaches us) to trade well, we shall have control of
nine-tenths of the total amount of the trade turnover.
This is the only way to restore the gold circulation and
to transform, the New Economic Policy from a system of
fooling communist fools, who hold power but are incapable
of using it, into a base for socialism, a base which, this
being a peasant country. no power on earth can vanquish.
 

Show this to Sokolnikov. We should harass the State
Bank and the People’s Commissariat for Finance, until
we get this going.

Yours,

Lenin

Comrade Tsyurupa:

I should like to draw your attention especially to my
letter to Sokolnikov on trade, the State Bank and the
State Bank’s Trade
Department.[2]


The crucial thing is trade and its control by the State
Bank.

It looks as though the State Bank’s Trade Department
has nothing to do with “commerce”, and is just as
sh.....
bureaucratic as everything else in the R.S.F.S.R. I
believe that we should concentrate all our efforts on this 

and secure the introduction of commission fees,
verification by practice, and the expulsion from the State Bank’s
Trade Department of everything that is .flabby, everything
that is not commercial, everything that is unable to
secure success in trade.

We do not need a “department for internal trade” (we
have enough of such
sh.. as departments), but one or two
dozen men at the State Bank who know how to trade (and
teach others to do so). This is crucial, without this the
monetary system cannot be put straight.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Molotov

Please show this letter to all members of the Politbureau
and return it to me with their remarks. I think Chicherin
is quite right that Radek has given fresh proof in this case
that, for all his numerous merits, he is absolutely unfit
to be a
diplomatist.[1]

Notes

This is written on G. V. Chicherin’s letter of February 18, 1922,           

saying that K. B. Radek, in an interview published in She                   

French bourgeois newspaper Le Matin, described the negotiations    

with the French Government, and in so doing made some attacks               

against Britain. Chicherin believed this was premature and said             

that Radek’s interview had done Soviet Russia diplomatic harm.

On the letter are remarks by members of the Politbureau of         

the R.C.P.(B.) C.C., expressing agreement with Lenin’s opinion.

21/II.
Comrades Kamenev and Stalin

It is quite ridiculous to say that you are at fault or
anything like it because of our long conversation. There are
no objective symptoms in my illness (today, after an
excellent night I am quite unwell), and I alone could
estimate just how much strength I had. It was also ray own
fault, because you had repeatedly asked me whether I was
tired or not.

I would very strongly advise that you should not forget 

1) to remove Radek from diplomacy without
fail[1]

;



2) Lapinsky as well.

3) Over the enclosed letter from Smilga give someone
(N. P. Gorbunov?) stricter instructions to get the thing
actually
done.[4]

4) This should be added about Myasnikov: either print
the whole of my letter or meaningful and complete extracts

    

from it (otherwise it looks vague, and no one will
understand anything: perhaps Lenin wrote in favour of
Myasnikov?).[5]

5) I sent A. D. Tsyurupa my opinion of his project on
the Narrow C.P.C. It needs careful thought, checking up
and weighing again and
again.[2]


6) I contest § 8 of the Politbureau decision of 20/II.
It is not right, not right at all to take
Sokolnikov.[6]

7) The draft decree on Workers’ and Peasants’
inspection should be rewritten, thought out, specified, enlarged
and presented as an interpretation and summary of the
laws
in force.[3]


Lenin

P.S. We should have Pravda and Izvestia carry a dozen
articles on “Milyukov merely  contemplates”. Pravda of
21/II.

If this is confirmed, make sure to sack 20–40 professors.

They are fooling us.

This should be thought out, prepared and a strong blow
delivered.[7]

Lenin

[4]
In a letter from Berlin on February 12, 1922, I. T. Smilga, head
of the Central Fuel Administration of the Supreme Economic
Council, reported about the unsuccessful demands for remittances to
Germany of funds for the Administration, as a result of which
equipment for the coal and oil industries was purchased only to “an
insignificant amount”. He requested the earliest remittance of
the funds (Central Party Archives of the institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).





[5]
A reference to Lenin’s letter to G. I. Myasnikov of August 5,
1921 (see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 504–09). The proposal
related to a Politbureau decision on Myasnikov of February 20, 1922.
Having heard the report of a commission set up by the Orgbureau
of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee on July 29, 1921, to inquire
into Myasnikov’s anti-Party activity, the Politbureau approved
the commission’s proposal to expel him from the Party.





[6]
A Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. decision of February 20,
1922, included G. Y. Sokolnikov in the R.C.P.(B.) delegation
to the “international communist conference”, the first enlarged
plenary meeting of the Executive Committee of the Comintern,
which was held in Moscow from February 21 to March 4, 1922.





[7]
The above-mentioned article reported a strike by lecturers of the
Moscow Higher Technical College, who had taken their cue from
the Cadet Poslednie Novosti, published by the whiteguard émigrés
in Paris.

On February 24, 1922, Izvestia VTsIK carried an article “Cadets
at Work” (On the Lecturers’ Strike at the Moscow Higher
Technical College).

21/II.

Comrade Gorbunov:

Both results are drawn up
badly.[1] These people don’t
know how to distinguish technology from economics,
conclusions from premises.

I propose that you:

1) have both the S.E.C. and the State Planning
Commission separately give their conclusion signed by responsible
persons, as soon as possible;
 

2) at once take exploratory measures to enable us to
obtain a written and signed conclusion from all the
members of the Mikhailov commission one by one, and leaving
them the least possibility to make arrangements with each
other (it’s up to you to do this cleverly: phone up everyone,
find out who is free at what hour, send cyclists to “catch”
them, etc.);

3) the conclusion should be drawn up in accordance with
the following programme (explanations and notes
separately) 

1. Possible extraction worth ... million gold rubles

α) now

β) with additional expenditure of ... million gold
rubles over a period of ... years

(separately for Kyshtym, Ridder, Ekibastuz,
Tanalyk),

2. Shall we manage without the concessionaire (probably)
or not? if not, why?

α) due to lack of capital?

β) due to the impossibility of buying and bringing
in first-class equipment?

γ) due to the impossibility of employing first-class
engineers?

δ) due to the impossibility of buying and bringing
in foodstuffs? clothes? workers?


or for any other (which?) reasons?

3. Conclusion:

α) shall we accept Urquhart’s terms?

β) modify them? how?

γ) reject them altogether?

You must first manage (swiftly) to catch all the
members of the commission separately, and get their written
replies to these questions.

Then let me know the results, and after this we shall
put pressure on the S.E.C. and the State Planning
Commission.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the conclusions of the I. K. Mikhailov
commission on whether to grant a concession to Leslie Urquhart.





[2]
The Mikhailov commission had reached the Conclusion that
foreign capitalists were to blame for destroying the indicated
enterprises, and came out against granting a concession to Urquhart.
Replying to Lenin’s questions, the commission emphasised that
these enterprises could be restored by the efforts of the Soviet
state. See this volume, Document 758.

22/II.
Secret

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky:

In one of his letters to the C.C., Comrade Trotsky,
writes about the failure of our planning organs.

This is true insofar as, for instance, the administrative
side of the work at
Gosplan[1]
is definitely not organised.

The personal responsibility of every member of Gosplan
for such-and-such (principal) functions has not been
established. There is no distribution between Gosplan members
of the work of “general supervision” over the plan’s
fulfilment, without which everything == 0.

Etc.

Conclusion: we must hasten with the draft decisions
(let’s have them as soon as possible), both about Gosplan’s
staffs and its Presidium (of 15 men?? I think this will make
it worse, because then there will be even less personal
responsibility), and the 3-man Presidium Bureau (let’s see
your arguments: I think this Bureau should be the
Presidium itself). I wonder who could substitute for Pyatakov
for a time (until 15.V)?

The three members of the Bureau (if the C.C. confirms
three: you + Pyatakov + Osadchy) should set up the
administrative section anew. If Pyatakov + Osadchy are to be
the administrators, they will answer with their heads for
any “slip” (failure to appoint some Gosplan member to
do such-and-such a job, failure to check up on his work,
failure to bring some shortage to notice in good time,
etc.).[2]


Hurry on with the final draft of the relationships with the
planning organs of the People’s Commissariats, the
composition of the Bureau, etc.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Dear Comrades:

I am very sorry and hope that you will excuse me for
being unable, because of my illness, to let you have an
article or a letter for your collection, something that ought
to have been done. The Soviet power has been doing
everything possible and a few impossible things, is doing and
will continue to do this to help the starving. Best regards
and wishes for the complete success of your publication.

With communist greetings,


V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

foreign languages for distribution in Russia and abroad. The
letter said its Central Committee requested Lenin to let them have

Comrade Kamenev:

Write me briefly about the
mandate.[1] We can’t have
this pickled. Perhaps, we could decide it this way: leave
the old text. Add five lines: trade instead of commodity

    

exchange. Accept the dates (twice a year or even less often),
as the local people have decided.

Lenin

P.S. Reply about the German doctor.

About Peshekhonov, I propose that the Politbureau adopt
the following decision:
1) instruct Popov to give him work
involving trade and sanitary statistics, and no other;
2)
impose on Popov personally the responsibility to see that
Peshekhonov keeps out of politics;
3) inform Popov of
§§ 1 and 2 orally, against his signature, without giving
him any paper, with the serious warning that if he
divulges this, he will be dismissed and prosecuted;
4) set
Unschlicht the task of keeping a strict watch on Peshekhonov;
5) issue a reprimand to the Kharkov Gubernia Committee
and the Ukrainian C.C. (for making this public) with an
entry in the Party
card.[2]

on February 25, 1922. See also Note 54.

March 15.[1]

Comrade Chicherin or Litvinov
Copy to Comrade Molotov
(for Politbureau members)

February 25, 1922

Having read, apart from the telegrams, the leaders in
today’s newspapers, I come to the conclusion that the
Note concerning the postponement of the Genoa Conference
without any indication of date should be couched in the
most insolent and derisive tone, so that the people at
Genoa should feel the slap in the face. It looks as though the
only way to create an actual impression is to be
superinsolent. In particular, we could say that among our
counterclaims we include the expenses incidental to the fact
that these powers have failed to fulfil their initial
obligation—to convene the conference at the appointed time.
We must not miss the opportunity when we can, through
an insolent and mocking Note, help bring about a situation

    

in which all the pacifist elements of the bourgeoisie will
be strengthened all over the
world.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote this letter, as well as the note to the Politbureau
members of February 24, and the notes to J. V. Stalin and L. B.
Kamenev of February 25, 1922 (see this volume, Document 649,
and also present edition, Vol. 42, p. 404), in connection with a
radio message from the Italian Foreign Minister Torretta to
G. V. Chicherin of February 24, 1922, saying that the Italian
Government was forced to postpone the Genoa Conference in view
of a ministerial crisis. The radio message was published in
Izvestia VTsIK No. 45, on February 25, 1922.





[2]
That same day, February 25, 1922, Chicherin sent Italian Foreign
Minister Torretta and British Foreign Secretary Curzon a
telegram on the date of the Genoa Conference, and it was published

   

in Izvestia VTsIK No. 47, on February 28, 1922 (see Dokumenty
vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol. V, Moscow, 1961, pp. 113–15).

Comrade Bryukhanov:

It now remains to work out practical proposals:

Sell the People’s Commissariat for Food so much?

For commodity exchange for grain give (on credit?) so
much on such-and-such terms?

Use warehouses in this way?

Agreement on such terms?

27/II. Lenin
 

Comrade Gorbunov:

Send this off and keep track.

27/II. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written in_connection with a letter from M. I. Frumkin,
Deputy People’s Commissar for Food, on February 20, 1922,
who objected to the plan for trading in salt, which he believed to
be wrong. Frumkin requested that the reply to his letter should
be sent to Bryukhanov.

N. P. Bryukhanov, replying on March 6 to Lenin’s note, wrote
that the People’s Commissariat for Food had organised the trade in
salt “in the very direction” suggested by Lenin. Bryukhanov
reported the preparation of an agreement with the Supreme Economic
Council and other measures (Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

27/II.1922.

A. D. Tsyurupa, C.L.D. Deputy Chairman. S.E.C. Chairman

Copies:

Pyatakov (GUT[1]

)


Morozov (Glavtorf[2]

)


People’s Commissariat for Finance


People’s Commissariat for Workers’
and Peasants’ Inspection

I hereby issue a reprimand for failure to perform their
official duty and for allowing red tape on the
Gidrotorf[3]

case.

To Comrade Pyatakov


Comrade Morozov


Comrades Zaks and Gorbunov.

Comrade Pyatakov, acting head of GUT, should not have
“requested me to believe” (his paper of 22/II) or “requested
me either to satisfy Gidrotorf over and above the estimates,
or allow a reduction of its activity”—such a “request”
addressed to me is failure to understand the elements of
state relations—he should have given thought as to how
to fulfil the C.P.C. decision (and not mine) on Gidrotorf
of
30.X.1920.[5]
 

If Pyatakov had not been informed of this decision, it
is necessary to arrest the numerous GUT specialists and
red tapists, whose duty it was to know, to inquire, and
to give Pyatakov a reminder. Not to put such scoundrels
under arrest is to encourage red tape, which is stifling us.

The C.P.C. decision of 30.X.1920 makes it clear that,
finding himself in a quandary, Pyatakov should not have
written an empty paper No. 00770 (of 22.II), but should
at once have called (or should have asked the S.E.C.
Chairman or A. D. Tsyurupa to call) a conference of the People’s
Commissars for the S.E.C. + Finance + Workers’ and
Peasants’ Inspection for the purpose of at once working out
a draft C.L.D. and C.P.C. decision (to take so much from
Tsutorf[4]

or Glavtorf, so much from GUT for Gidrotorf, to
allocate so much over and above the estimates, and to
reduce the Gidrotorf programme by so much).

It was Pyatakov’s duty to do this in pursuance of the
C.P.C. decision of 30.X.1920, which binds all People’s
Commissariats in fact to recognise Gidrotorf as “being of
exceptional state importance”, and apply “all privileges”
to it....

Comrade Morozov should have urgently requested
the convocation of such a conference (and complained about
any delay), instead of writing a purely squabbling piece
of paper on 22.II (No. 184/&piwhatthe, in Register: 22/II.1922) in
which the author engages in indecent whimpering instead
of making business-like proposals.

Comrades Zaks and Gorbunov, if they had had any idea
of their duty as members of the Managing Department,
instead of being guided by the spirit of exchange of the
most empty-pieces of paper, should have found the C.P.C.
decision of 30.X.1920, and should have themselves read
from it the only correct, the only lawful way: immediate
convocation of a People’s Commissars’ conference. The
papers in the charge of Zaks and Gorbunov are even
outwardly in disorder, because there is no reference to the
law, nor a concise summary of the Gidrotorf application,
nor any record of the date of this summary, or of my

    

marking. If such negligence is shown once again, I shall
dismiss both Zaks and Gorbunov from their posts.

Comrade Tsyurupa, I ask you to have the above-named
comrades sign immediately that they are aware of the
reprimand issued to them, and to prescribe to the People’s
Commissars for the S.E.C., Finance and Workers’ and
Peasants’ Inspection to convene, at once, if possible on
Tuesday, 28/II, but riot later than Wednesday, 1/III, in any
case, an early morning conference with the personal
participation of the People’s Commissars (who may send in
comrades who are quite competent and capable of deciding
in their stead, to substitute for them, if they are absolutely
unable to attend for a good reason) and of a representative
from Gidrotorf, and also, of course, of GUT and Glavtorf.

The task of the conference: to carry out not only the
letter, but the meaning of the C.P.C. decision of 30.X.1920,
and try to give maximum satisfaction to Gidrotorf (if it
is impossible to do so 100 per cent, then make sure anyway that
the bulk of its 1922 work should be completed). Gidrotorf
should be satisfied partly at the expense of Tsutorf and
GUT, and partly over and above the estimates. Be sure to
complete the work by the evening of 1.III, and bring it
up at the C.L.D. administrative sitting on the evening of
1.III for subsequent approval by the C.L.D. and the
Council of People’s
Commissars.[6]

Please, strictly instruct the Secretariat and keep a
personal check on the speed and correctness of the
execution of this order.

Conscious revolutionaries should, apart from their
official duties, give thought to the economic reasons which
had made the C.P.C. recognise Gidrotorf as “being of
exceptional state importance”.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
2

Comrade Tsyurupa:

I am sending you a specimen of our vile red tape and
obtuseness!

Just think—these are our best men, Pyatakov, Morozov
and others!
 

If it weren’t for the knout, they would have ruined the
whole cause.

It is my earnest request that you do everything you can
right away, hit those who are guilty once again more
painfully and get the thing done at once (through Gorbunov and
Lepeshinskaya, whom I told to prepare the 30.X.1920 decree,
etc., for you). Let Gidrotorf have 90 per cent if not 100 per cent.

Yours,

Lenin

Question of the State Bank’s Active Participation in Trade
Enterprises” submitted by various executives of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade, the State Planning Commission, members
of the editorial board of Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, etc. Referring
to the principles of banking arid all kinds of formal considerations,
they objected to the State Bank’s participation in trade.

Comrade Sokolnikov:

The whole point is 1) in these “guarantees”. The first
thing to do is to work them out and check twice and thrice;

2) in our “apparatus”. Can we manage to keep track?
Shall we manage to keep an eye? No, everything imaginable
will be taken out of the
country.[1]

28/II. Lenin

To N. P. Gorbunov:

Send a copy of my remark to Kamenev
    + Molotov,
    Stalin,
 Tsyurupa.

Give me another reminder.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written under the text of the “Draft C.P.C. Decision on the
Free Entry of Foodstuffs into the Russian Soviet Federation”,
proposed by G. Y. Sokolnikov and circulated among the
Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. members. The final point of the
draft said: “To permit the People’s Commissariat for Finance,
on grounds by agreement with the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade, to issue permits to state establishments and
enterprises and enterprises of the state trustified industry, and to
co-operatives and private persons, for the right to remit and
export cash, currency and all lands of valuables for the purpose

   

of acquiring abroad foodstuffs, with adequate guarantees granted
for their subsequent importation.” Lenin underscored the word
“guarantees” with four lines (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Comrade Gorbunov:

I cannot go into this in
detail.[1] Put the finishing
touches to this (yourself or through Zaks, Smolyaninov or
Nesterov) and show to A. D. Tsyurupa, and then to me
again with his opinion.

NB:
Here are, I think, the
main points which
should he verified, copied
out and kept track of.

The rest seems to be
noodles.

{{


1) Area? Dessiatines?

2) Value of annual product?
  Roughly.

3) Our predominance?
  (Krasin’s § XIII)
   Check up!

4) Foreigners’ share? (Krasin’s
§ XIV)
   Check up!

5) Krasin’s § XV is
important.[2]

28/II. >Lenin

P.S. Find out and let me know whether these agreements
are final? Have they entered into force?

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the “Basic Provisions of an Agreement with the
British Company ‘Russangloles-Limited’” and “Basic
Provisions of an Agreement with the Dutch Firm ‘Alcius & Co.’”,
signed by L. B. Krasin, on the establishment, together with
“Severoles”, of the joint-stock companies “Russangloles” and
“Russgollandles” for the purpose of developing the timber industry
and intensifying timber export operations in Archangel Region
and the adjacent areas.





[2]
The material submitted to Lenin showed that the proportion of
the assets being returned to their former owners constituted
35–40 per cent for “Russangloles” and 20–30 per cent for
“Russgollandles”, adding that even this share of the property was not
conveyed to their ownership, but was placed at the disposal of mixed
companies on whose boards the Soviet side was assured of
predominant influence (§§ XIII and XIV). § XV said that the former
owners, both British and Dutch, had waived in writing any
claims on the R.S.F.S.R.

Having studied the material, Lenin considered that it was
possible to conclude an agreement on these terms.

The basic provisions of the agreement with
“Russangloles-Limited” and “Alcius & Co.” were approved by the Council of
People’s Commissars in April 1922, and the agreements, in March
1923.

February 28, 1922
To Comrade Molotov
(for Politbureau members)

Please inquire from the Politbureau members by phone
about the following: to speed up the question on the C.C.
directive [to the
delegation][1]

to the Genoa Conference,
I propose that the initial draft of this directive, as
apparently not meeting with great objections from the
Politbureau members, should be sent this very day to Chicherin,
telling him not to make a copy and to keep the document
in total secrecy, while taking steps to have all the members
of the delegation informed of this draft today, either at
a general meeting or in some other way. Then, the
discussion of the question may very well win a great deal in terms
of time and definition. Let us have written amendments
submitted to this
draft.[2]

Draft
DECISION OF THE ALL-RUSSIA
CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The All-Russia C.E.C. has resolved:

1)

To entrust the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection with control and supervision over the activity of all public
and private organisations, establishments and enterprises, without
exception, from the standpoint of fulfilment of the obligations they
have undertaken from state organs.
 align="right">
2)   

In pursuance of this, the P.C.W.P.I. shall have the power of:

1. Subsequent, control over all monetary and material 
 align="center">
3)

resources, allocated by the state to the said organisations, enterprises
and establishments, by way;of financing, subsidy and credits,
extended to them, or made available to them on the strength of contracts
concluded by them with the state, and verification of all acts flowing
from these obligations....

To Comrade Stalin

That won’t do.

1) Not to “entrust”, but to explain the laws in
force and their incompleteness in the given sense.

2) Not only from this standpoint. But also
from the standpoint of legality. And from the
standpoint of collecting material for new laws.
And from many other standpoints.

3) Not only “allocated by the state”.

Very
urgent!!


This should be rewritten once again. Thought
out three times more thoroughly. Many more
details given. Everything set out so that the

 

whole should not have the appearance of a new
decree, but of an elucidation and summary of
the old ones.

Pass through the C.P.C. and confirm by the
All-Russia C.E.C. on someone’s complaint.


This is urgent! Very urgent !!

Please let me have both this and the new
draft after reworking.

Lenin

No. 67 of March 24, 1922). For Lenin’s correspondence on the

With my help you have now obtained what you need
for your
works.[1]

For all our poverty and wretchedness,
you have been allocated large amounts over and above
those issued earlier.

You must make quite sure:

1. that nothing is done to no purpose, 

2. that you do not bite off more than the allocated
resources allow, 

3. that the experiments you stage should be backed up
with all possible proof and should produce final answers
on the practical and economic fitness of the new method
of extracting peat, 

4. to devote special attention to accounting for the
expenditure of the amounts allocated to you.

The accounting should be arranged in such a way as
to make it possible to judge about the cost of the peat
extracted.

      To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau members

March 3, 1922

Sokolnikov’s theses (“Basic Provisions of the Financial
Programme”) are, I think, not bad, but on the theoretical side.

I am making a special study of one point (beginning of
§ 12) and shall write about it separately.

For the rest, I propose: submit for opinion to the State
Planning Commission, Preobrazhensky and Krasnoshchekov.
Then print with cuts (for the time being throw out the point
on substituting the cash tax for the tax in kind, etc.).

Now, on the substance of the matter. I think these two
things are pivotal:

1) how to find fierce and clever men for harassing all
the People’s Commissariats (plus the Moscow, plus the
Petrograd Soviets): reduce staffs in practice and severely;

2) how to teach our bureaucratic “torgs” (including the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, Mostorg,
Petrotorg, etc., etc.) to trade instead of engaging in red tape.

Perhaps we should authorise the All-Russia C.E.C.
Presidium to adopt this decision:

All People’s Commissariats plus the Moscow and
Petrograd Soviets shall have the duty to submit within a week
a draft decision transferring their staffs (all who are
connected with economics) to percentage payments from
turnover and from profits, with fierce penalties for losses,
flabbiness and bungling, and with the obligation to reply
to commercial inquiries within 3–6 hours, under penalty
of prison terms of not less than 5 years.

For the best draft decision—a prize of 100,000 gold
rubles, to be paid after a year’s successful trial of the
decision, so that payment is proportional to the success (100%
success == 100% prize, 1% success == 1% prize).

3.III.1922

Comrade Kamenev:

I have been thinking for some time about our talk (with
you, Stalin and Zinoviev) on
Vneshtorg[1]

and the Krasin
and the Sokolnikov line.

My conclusion is that Krasin is absolutely right. We
cannot now afford to retreat on our foreign trade monopoly
beyond what Lezhava has proposed and is proposing in his
theses. Otherwise, foreigners will buy up and carry away
everything that is valuable.

Here and in all of his work, Sokolnikov is making a
great mistake, which is sure to ruin us, unless the C.C.
corrects his line in time, and actually secures
implementation of the corrected line. His mistake is abstract
enthusiasm for a scheme (something of which Sokolnikov has
always been guilty, as a talented journalist and a politician
who is easily carried away). An example: Sokolnikov has
proposed a draft decree on importing foreign foodstuffs to
Russia. In the decree he says, in passing: as for the
“guarantees”, special provision will be made for them (i.e.,
guarantees that the values taken out of Russia allegedly in
exchange for foodstuffs do really and entirely go for food).

This is downright childishness!

The whole point is in the guarantees, and it is this point
that Sokolnikov “puts off”, shrugging it off with an empty
phrase or a pious wish.

What are the real guarantees?

Is it to be a pledge?

Just think what this means:

1) I want to buy 100,000 gold rubles’ worth of
foodstuffs abroad. I deposit this amount at the State Bank as
a pledge?

In that case, all the red tape is still there (unless we
“teach” Vneshtorg & Co. how to get rid of the red tape).

Furthermore, where are the “guarantees” that in
remitting 100,000 gold rubles abroad, I am not remitting 20,000

    

gold rubles of them fictitiously? A check-up on the prices?
By whom? How? This is a bureaucratic Utopia!

Sokolnikov’s project shows that our kind, talented and
most valuable Comrade Sokolnikov knows nothing at all
about practical commerce. And it is going to ruin us if
it is set in motion.

It is the greatest mistake to think that NEP has put
an end to terrorism. We shall yet return to terrorism, and
it will be an economic terrorism.

The foreigners are already buying up our officials with
bribes, and “carting out what there is left of Russia”.
They may well succeed.

Monopoly is a polite warning: my dear sirs, the time
will come when I shall hang you for this.

The foreigners, knowing that the Bolsheviks are in
earnest, have to reckon with this seriously.

That is why 

1) the foreign trade monopoly should not be undermined,
in any case;

2) Lezhava’s theses should be adopted not later than
tomorrow;

3) publish right away (we have lost heaps of time), on
behalf of the All-Russia C.E.C. Presidium, a firm, cold,
fierce statement that we do not intend to retreat in the
economy any farther, and that those who attempt to cheat
us (or circumvent the monopoly, etc.) will face terrorism;
this word should not be used, but the likelihood of it
should be “hinted at subtly and politely”.

If this is not done through the All-Russia C.E.C.
Presidium, it can be done otherwise (a letter of mine? that is
worse!); but it needs to be done and fast. Then, here is an
example.

The Moscow Gubernia Economic Conference offers to buy
tinned food (or any kind of food) for Soviet rubles. The
talks with Vneshtorg last for two weeks. It objects.

The deal falls through.

Conclusion?

Are we to give the Gubernia Economic Conference the
necessary rights? This would mean “duplicating” a bad
Vneshtorg with bad little Vneshtorgs, of which the
capitalists will buy up 90 per cent.
 

Another conclusion: stop this game of decrees (there was
an indispensable period of propaganda by decree; that was
necessary for the success of the revolution. This is over).

There should not be the slightest trust in decrees or
institutions. The only thing is to verify practice and take
people to task for red tape.

That is the only thing clever people should engage in.
Anything else should entail ... prison for the rest.

Here is what I would propose: authorise the All-Russia
C.E.C. Presidium to adopt the following decision right away:

In view of the scandalous red tape on the deal
(such-and-such) involving the purchase of food for Soviet rubles,
order the State Political Administration (they need a little
scaring!) to find those guilty of red tape and incarcerate
for 6 hours those working for the Moscow Gubernia
Economic Conference, and for 36 hours those working at
Vneshtorg (of course, with the exception of All-Russia C.E.C.
members: after all, we enjoy almost parliamentary
immunity).

After this, instruct the press to ridicule both groups and
pour dirt on them. For the disgraceful thing here is that
Muscovites (in Moscow!) have failed to cope with the red
tape. For this they should be beaten with a stick.

They “did not know how” to send a telephone message
saying:

“urgent advantageous deal. Demand Vneshtorg’s reply
within 3 hours. Copy to Molotov for the C.C., to
Tsyurupa and Yenukidze for the C.P.C. and the All-Russia
C.E.C.”

No reply within 3 hours? Another 4 lines of complaint
by phone.

But we find these idiots walking around and talking for
two weeks! They deserve to be left to rot in gaol instead
of being given exemptions. The Muscovites deserve 6 hours
in the bughouse for stupidity. The Vneshtorg people, 36 
hours in the bughouse for stupidity plus for
“central-responsibility”.

That is the only way to teach them. Otherwise, Soviet
personnel, local and central, will never learn. We cannot
afford to trade freely: that is Russia’s ruin.

But we can and will learn to transfer our red tapists

    

on to a percentage basis: on every deal you get so much per
cent (fraction of a per cent), and jail—for failure to work.

And the men at the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Trade need to be changed. The same applies to our state
trusts, which are “headed” by holier-than-thou members
of the All-Russia C.E.C. and “famous” Communists, who
are being duped by businessmen.

Order to the People’s Commissar for Finance: either you
will manage to expel these holier-than-thou Communists
from the state trusts through the State Bank (no credits;
I prosecute you for delinquency, for inefficiency, etc.),
or, the whole of your People’s Commissariat for Finance
and the State Bank are quite useless, being nothing but
empty talk and a paper chase.

That is how the work both of the C.P.C. and the C.L.D.
(I have already written to Tsyurupa, and have worked out
the draft of a relevant
directive[2]

)

and of the Politbureau
should be re-arranged; otherwise, our ruin is inevitable.

Please, let the members of the Politbureau and Molotov
read this in secret and return to me with each one’s remarks
in a couple of words at least.

Yours,

Lenin

The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.—Ed.

[2]
See present edition, Vol. 35, Document 310.—Ed.
 



[3]
Written in connection with a discussion of the question of the
foreign trade monopoly which was carried on in the Party’s
governing circles at the end of 1921 and throughout the whole of 1922.

The foreign trade monopoly, established by the C.P.C. decree
of April 22, 1318, was repeatedly confirmed by Soviet
Government decisions. The transition to the New Economic Policy and
the extension of trade ties with foreign countries called for various
additions to legislation on foreign trade. The “Theses on
Foreign Trade” prepared on Lenin’s instructions by A. M. Lezhava,
Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, emphasised
the need to consolidate the foreign trade monopoly, and defined
the terms for the export and import of goods in the new
conditions. The theses were endorsed by Lenin and adopted by the
Supreme Economic Commission of the C.P.C. on January 4, 1922.
The retention of the foreign trade monopoly was opposed by
G. Y. Sokolnikov, N. I. Bukharin and G. L. Pyatakov. J. V. Stalin,
G. Y. Zinoviev and L. B. Kamenev favoured an easing of the
foreign trade monopoly.

On March 4, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
adopted, with some amendments, the “Theses on Foreign Trade”
approved by Lenin. In their final form they wore approved on March 
10. On the basis of these theses, the Presidium of the All-Russia
C.E.C. on March 13 adopted its decision “On Foreign Trade”,
which was published in Izvestia VTsIK No. 60, on March 15,
1922.

Despite the Politbureau decision of March 4 and 10, Sokolnikov
again put forward the plan to allow the trusts, co-operatives
and others to purchase food abroad; Deputy People’s Commissar
for Foreign Trade, M. I. Frumkin, also came out in favour of
easing the foreign trade monopoly, suggesting; that only the
wholesale trading in four or five products should be left in the hands
of the state as a firm monopoly. The inner-Party struggle over
the foreign trade monopoly was having a negative effect on
business negotiations with foreign capitalists. In connection with
this, Lenin proposed on May 15, 1922, the following Politbureau
directive, which was adopted on May 22: “The C.C. confirms
the foreign trade monopoly and resolves to stop everywhere the
elaboration and preparation of the question of integrating
the Supreme Economic Council with the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade” (Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p. 484).

However, the struggle did not cease. On October 6, 1922, the
C.C. Plenum, with Lenin ill and absent, adopted, on a motion
by G. Y. Zinoviev, a resolution on the basis of Sokolnikov’s
theses allowing freedom of import and export for some types of
goods or across some frontiers. On October 11, L. B. Krasin sent
in a request to the Party Central Committee that the October G
decision and the “Theses of the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade on the Foreign Trade Regime” should be rescinded.
Lenin supported Krasin and protested the decision of the C.C.
Plenum, pointing out that it was in fact thwarting the foreign
trade monopoly, and proposed that the question should be

   

referred for settlement to the next C.C. Plenum in December 1922
(see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 375–78). N. I. Bukharin came
out with objections to Lenin’s letter and L. B. Krasin’s theses.

Attaching great importance to the stability of the foreign trade
monopoly, but being unable, because of his illness, to attend
the C.C. Plenum on December 18, 1922, Lenin addressed a letter
to it on December 13, in which he sharply condemned Bukharin’s
stand. Considering Lenin’s insistent demands and the Politbureau
decisions, J. V. Stalin was forced to abandon his erroneous stand.
The C.C. Plenum condemned the standpoint of Bukharin and
Sokolnikov, rescinded the C.C. decision of October 6, and
reaffirmed the absolute necessity of maintaining the foreign trade
monopoly, without allowing any departures from it. The Party’s
Twelfth Congress, which was held from April 17 to 25, 1923, and
in which Lenin was also unable to take part because he was
unwell, resolved: “The congress categorically reaffirms the stability
of the foreign trade monopoly and the inadmissibility of any
circumvention of it or hesitations in implementing it, and instructs
the new C.C. to take systematic measures to consolidate and
develop the regime of foreign trade monopoly” (KPSS v
resolutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov, conferentsii i plenumov TsKa,
Part 1, 1954, p. 682).

   To Politbureau members

Sokolnikov is missing the mark. What are the guarantees
that everything valuable will not be hauled out?

There are none.

Stealing is now going on; it’s true; let’s learn to catch
people for stealing, instead of making it easier for rich
foreigners to steal.

Written on G. Y. Sokolnikov’s letter in reply to Lenin’s note
of February 28 (see this volume, Document 662).

In his letter, Sokolnikov suggested that the trusts,
co-operatives and others should be allowed to purchase food abroad. In his
opinion, the guarantee that an excess of valuables would not be
taken out of the country and that food instead of other goods
would be imported in return was these organisations’ extreme
need of food, and control by the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade and the State Bank, through which all operations
should be conducted.

Comrade Molotov

I propose that we get the votes of the Politbureau
members to have a vote without delay on the following
proposal (about which I have already had a short preliminary
exchange with Stalin and Kamenev, and Zinoviev):
 

1) Put upon Comrade Rudzutak the duty to start
out immediately for a sanatorium and not to leave
it until the
congress,[1]

strictly keeping to the
established regimen.

2) Put the duty upon Dr. ... (what is the name of
the one who is working at the C.C.? And if lie is not
there, then upon Semashko) to arrange at once a
high-calory diet and treatment against TB for Rudzutak,
in one of the better sanatoriums, to give him a chance
to receive as much treatment as possible and rest,
before the Party Congress and the plenary  meeting
(24/III).[2]

With communist greetings,


Lenin

I am sending you M. Bagayev’s letter. Have a check
carried out of the facts given in his letter, and an
investigation of the reasons for the establishment of rates out
of all proportion to the crop, meting out punishment to
those guilty of abusing power in the collection of the tax
in kind and the harassment of the peasants, and also show
the picture of tax collection in other volosts of
Novonikolayevsk Gubernia.

The most vigorous steps have to be taken for the full
provision of seeds to the areas which have suffered from
the wrongful collection of the tax in kind.

Write me about
execution.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In reply to this letter, which was sent to Novonikolayevsk (now    

Novosibirsk) on March 6, 1922, S. Y. Chutskayev, Chairman of       


   

the Siberian Revolutionary Committee, on March 13, reported         

to Lenin by direct wire that an inquiry had been appointed into     

the abuses during the tax in kind collections in Novonikolayevsk    

Gubernia, and that its results would be reported later.

Chutskayev subsequently informed the C.P.C. that the facts      

staled in M. A. Bagayev’s letter were true and that a number    

of food agents had been committed for trial.

Copies to Gorbunov and Smolyaninov

Comrade Khinchuk:

I am unable to see the co-operative men because I am
unwell. My speech in which I tell about this ailment is to
be published
tomorrow.[1]

About the co-operative men. I fear
that they may have fictitiously blown up their liabilities
when handing them over to you. I am passing your memo
on to Gorbunov and Smolyaninov, and request you to send
also to them the final exact calculation of the assets and
liabilities, to enable them, to tell me the results.

How are things with the loan which you were expecting
before your departure, from the co-operative societies
abroad?

I shall be expecting short reports from you about the
development of the co-operative apparatus in Russia (I have
only the old figures: September—1 million, October—3,
November—6 million gold rubles). Do you now have the
10-day figures? Are there any precise data on how many
gubernia societies have and have not been submitting
correct reports to you? Do you apply the remuneration of
co-operative workers depending on the volume of their
turnover and the success achieved, and expressed in a
reduction of the percentage cost of our apparatus?

Please reply as briefly as possible to these questions and
inform me in addition about any serious measures the
Centrosoyuz Board has taken to see that our co-operative
establishment is truly a commercial and not a bureaucratic
organ. Tikhomirov’s letter, which I received a short time
ago and to which I have
replied,[2]

produced quite a few
doubts in my mind on this score, just as did the attempt
to publish a weekly newspaper called Kooperativnoye
Dyelo.[3]

It looks as if you have bureaucrats and intellectuals

    

sitting in unduly high places, who are capable of carrying
on a paper and a newspaper game, but are incapable of
trading.

the co-operative delegation, consisting of the representatives of
the International Co-operative Society, members of the British
Co-operative Wholesale Society and representatives of the French
and Czechoslovak co-operative societies, which had arrived in
Soviet Russia at the invitation of Centrosoyuz, was asking Lenin
to receive it. Khinchuk also said that an agreement had been
reached with the old Russian co-operators living abroad, who had
handed over to Centrosoyuz their valuables and apparatus in
Western Europe and America and declared that they were no
longer representatives of Russian co-operative societies abroad.
“This,” Khinchuk wrote, “was in fact the beginning of our
recognition abroad.” He gave a list of the valuables handed over
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of
the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

8/III.

Dear Comrade Varga:

I am ill. I am quite incapable of undertaking any work
at all.

If you compile a collection (of quotations from my works
or parts of them) I do not, of course, object to this, but
you must state that you are responsible for the selection.

Here is my request:

1) quote as fully as possible my works of the spring
of 1918 against the “Leftists”, about “state capitalism”
and the difficulties of administration, as a specific task;

2) (quote more fully) my pamphlet against “Infantile
Disorder” (general rules of tactics and
strategy)[1]

;



NB
3) never quote my speeches (their text is always bad,
always imprecisely conveyed); quote only my works.

Best regards,


Yours,


Lenin

P.S. Nor can I promise an afterword. You will declare
yourself responsible for the selection of the
quotations.[3]

Top secret
Comrade Krasin

Comrade Krasin:

You told me at one of our latest meetings that you had
had a talk with an English merchant about setting up a
mixed society for the sale of precious stones, etc.

Please write me a few lines: has this plan produced
anything? The same concerning Germany.

Then I ask you to answer this question: can you order
from anyone a short (not more than 2 or 3 pages) summary
of actual data characterising the development of our foreign
trade over the last few months, for instance, over the last
6 months. I would find such a thing extremely necessary for
my report at the Party
Congress.[1]

Here is a rough list of
the questions:

The number of trade treaties with other powers, stating
the month and year of their conclusion.

The number of mixed societies set up for trade with the
capitalists of various nations.

The monthly turnover of exports and imports in pre-war
rubles over the last few months.

Orders and imports with a division into foodstuffs and
items of industrial equipment.

The number of merchants enlisted by the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade on a commission basis,
Russian and foreign separately,
etc.[2]


With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky


Copy to Comrade Smolyaninov

The S.P.C. Concessions Committee is to have the duty
of collecting and keeping on file detailed material on all
concession negotiations and concession matters of the
R.S.F.S.R. with foreign capitalists, which are being
carried on both in Russia and abroad. The material should
also be collected for the past period.

The Concessions Committee must keep a precise register
of this material under the following heads:

a) agreements concluded;

b) serious negotiations on which agreements may be
concluded in the immediate future;

c) broken-off negotiations (give reason);

d) all other negotiations.

The list should give a short summary of the content
of the matter (roughly: state of negotiations, object of
concession, name of those seeking concession, rough or
precise amount of capital, and number of the case on file).

A copy of this list is to be sent to the C.L.D. Managing
Department, with monthly additions of new information.

The Concessions Committee should appoint a person
responsible for the collection of material and compilation of
the list (business manager, secretary), whose name should
be urgently communicated to the C.L.D. Managing
Department.

14.III.1922.

Comrade Chicherin:

I have read your letter of 10/III. I think yours is an
excellent exposition of the pacifist
programme.[3]
 

The whole point is to have the skill to expound it and
our commercial proposals loudly and clearly before the
fold-up (if “they” do try to fold it up in haste).

You and our delegation have enough skill to do this.

I think you have made some 13 points (I enclose your
letter with my remarks), which are excellent.

We shall have everyone intrigued by saying: “We have
a most broad arid comprehensive programme!” If they
prevent us from making it public, we shall print it with
our protest.

In every case we make this “little” reservation: we
Communists have our own communist programme (the Third
International); nevertheless we consider it to be our duty
as businessmen to support (even if the odds are 10,000 to 1)
the pacifists in the other, i.e., bourgeois, camp (taking
account of its Second and Two-and-a-Half
Internationals[4]).

This will be “genteel” and have teeth, and will help
to demoralise the enemy.

If we adopt such tactics we shall win out, even if Genoa
is a failure. We shall not accept any unprofitable deal.

With communist greetings,


Yours,


Lenin

14/III.

P.S. Comrade Chicherin:

Why not add even more “genteel” bite and say the
following:

We propose (§ 14) abolition of all war debts and (§ 15)
revision (on the basis of the 13 §§) of the Versailles and all
military
treaties,[5]

but not through the majority riding roughshod over the
minority, but on the basis of an agreement, because in
this case we are businessmen and cannot put forward any
other principle here than the commercial one! We don’t
want to have it all our way with the United States through
a majority; we are businessmen; we want to persuade it!!
A poll of all the states
and an attempt to persuade those
who do not agree. This is both genteel and unacceptable
to the bourgeois. We shall disgrace and humiliate them in
a very “genteel” way.
 

Here is a variant: submission of a minority of countries
(in population) to the majority can be proposed
separately within each of the two camps: the bourgeois and the
Soviet (the one recognising private property, and the other
not recognising it).

Let us put forward both the project and the variant.


Les rieurs seront avec
nous![1]


X)[2]

an additional point: an exemption to be made for
small-holders insofar as it can be precisely proved
that these are not fictitious but actual toiling
smallholders.

  MARGINAL NOTES
       ON A LETTER  G. V. CHICHERIN

COMRADE LENIN

March 10, 1922

Esteemed Vladimir Ilyich:

I earnestly request you to read through the proposals
made below and let me have your instructions. We have
to put forward “a broad pacifist programme”, that is one
of the most important elements of our forthcoming act;
we have not, however, got one. We have only the separate
fragmentary points in the first directives of the Central
Committee. I am here making a first attempt to approach
the task.

The chief difficulty is that the present international
political and economic forms serve as permanent fig-leaves
covering the predatory acts of the imperialists; in
particular, these forms serve as a weapon against us. The
League of Nations is simply a tool of the Entente, which has
already used it against us. You have yourself pointed out
that arbitration between the bourgeois and Soviet states is
impossible; nevertheless arbitration is an indispensable
weapon in the pacifist arsenal. The internationalisation of the
Chinese-Eastern Railway is a euphemism for its
alienation from us and from China and its seizure by the Entente.
A foreign bank of issue in Russia and the introduction of
the dollar into Russia, like the introduction of a universal
single gold unit in general, would be the most effective
weapon for complete economic bondage to America.

We have to introduce something new into the customary
modern international forms to prevent those forms from
being turned into a tool of imperialism. This new something
is provided by our experience and our creative activity as
    

well as by the creative action of life itself in the process
of the growing ruin and break-up of the imperialist world.
The world war has resulted in the intensification of the
liberation movement of all oppressed and colonial peoples.
World states are coining undone at the seams. Our
international programme must bring all oppressed colonial
peoples into the international scheme. The right of all peoples
to secession or to home rule must be recognised. The
African Conference of 1885 resulted in the horrors of the
Belgian Congo, because the European powers at that
conference indulged in philanthropy towards the Negroes and that
philanthropy turned out to be a fig-leaf covering the most
barbaric exploitation. The novelty of our international
scheme must be that the Negro and
other colonial peoples

participate on an equal footing with the European peoples

 1)
 |||| true!
 2)


in conferences and commissions and have the right to
prevent interference in their internal affairs. Another novelty
is the
obligatory participation of working-class
organisations. The demand for trade unions to take part in a future
European congress was very popular in British
working-class literature during the world war. We have actually
realised this by including three members of the All-Russia
Central T.U.C. in our delegation. We must lay down that
one-third of the votes in the international organisation we
are going to propose should belong to the working-class
organisations represented in each delegation. These two
novelties, however, are not sufficient to protect the oppressed
peoples and downtrodden countries from the domination
of the imperialists because the upper stratum of the
colonial peoples may well be puppets in the same way as
treacherous labour leaders are. The inclusion of these two opens
up the way for future struggles. Working-class
organisations will be confronted with the task of struggling for the
liberation of the colonial peoples, for aid to the Soviet
power and against imperialist depredation. The leaders,
however, will try to betray them. Therefore another thing to
be established is
3)

the principle of non-intervention on the
part of international conferences or congresses in the
internal affairs of various peoples.
Voluntary co-operation
and aid for the weak on the part of the strong must be
applied without subordinating the former to the latter.

As a result we have a very bold and completely new
proposal—A WORLD CONGRESS with all peoples of the
world participating on a completely equal footing, on the
basis of the declaration of the right to self-determination,

    

the right to complete secession or home rule for all
oppressed peoples, and also with the participation of
working-class organisations to the extent of one-third of the entire
congress. The purpose of the congress will not be

4))

compulsion of the minority but complete agreement. The
congress will help by its moral authority. In practice it will set
up
technical commissions for the implementation of our

pre-
((




extensive economic programme of world-wide rehabilitation.

All the projects for a League of Nations or Association
of Nations contain only two types of proposals concerning
methods of compulsion to ensure fulfilment of the decisions
of an Association of Nations—either the establishment of
composite armies with contingents from all states or the
investment of a punitive mandate in a certain power or
several such powers. In the first case we would have
something incompetent because a composite army made up of
contingents from numerous countries is of no use. In the
second case the League of Nations or Association of Nations
is nothing but an excuse to justify fresh conquests by the
more influential powers.

correct!
|||


And so it is essential to eliminate
completely the element of compulsion or punitive
expeditions and leave to the World Congress only its moral
authority, allowing it to be an arena for discussions aimed at
reaching agreement. The prevention of war is a matter for
arbitration. There are two types of arbitration—the
voluntary appeal of the two parties to an arbiter, to The Hague
Tribunal, for instance—in such cases the decision of the
arbiter is binding—or the second method, an example of
which is to be found in the article on arbitration contained
in the treaty between Great Britain and the United States
according to which, in the event of there being a danger
of war, special conciliation commissions are set up to which
the two parties must appeal but whose decision is merely
advisory although for a definite period, for instance a year,
the proceedings of the commissions continue; this second
method has as its purpose the postponement of the
beginning of military action to enable the passions of both
parties to subside in the legally established interval and
lessen the conflict. In the first case appeal to the arbiter is
not obligatory but decisions are binding. In the second
case appeal to the arbiter is obligatory but decisions are
not binding, and the parties are bound only for the legally
established period.

At the present moment we cannot avoid this alternative.
The proposed World Congress could take over The Hague
Tribunal with its advisory arbitration and other services.
We shall, however, consider that the only court of arbitration
between a capitalist state and the Soviet state can be that
    

(5)

in which an equal number of members is appointed by each

5)

party so that half the members will be imperialists and half
will be Communists. At the same time we shall propose a

(6)

==

general reduction of armaments based on the theses we have

6)

established with the Revolutionary Military Council of the
Republic; developing the traditions of The Hague and
Geneva conventions we shall propose adding a number of

prohibitions to the rules of war—the abolition of submarines,

7)

chemical gases, mortars, flame-throwers and armed air
battles.

The technical commissions set up by the World Congress

8)

will guide the implementation of a broad programme of
world-wide rehabilitation. This programme will not be
imposed by force. It will be a voluntary proposal that appeals
to the advantage of every participant. Aid will be given
to the weak. In this way world railways, river and sea

9)

routes must be laid down. The internationalisation of
those routes will be a matter of gradual development since
the compulsion of those who resist will not be allowed.
International technical commissions will propose to
individual countries economic and technical aid for the
creation of super-main lines, for the regulation of traffic on
international rivers, for the use of international harbours and
for the technical improvement of world sea routes. We
shall propose that the capital of the advanced countries
should build a
super-main line London-Moscow-Vladivostok

10)

(Peking) and we shall explain that it will open up the
incalculable wealth of Siberia for the use of all. In general,
aid from the strong for the weak will be the basic principle
of world rehabilitation which must be based on economic
geography and. the planned distribution of resources. A world
gold unit can make its appearance only as a result of the
improvement of the economically weak countries with the
aid of the strong: this improvement is in the interest of all
since world ruin affects the strong countries as well, giving
rise to unparalleled unemployment, even in America. The
strong, by helping the weak, are opening up for themselves
markets and sources of raw materials. Proceeding from
these premises we shall propose the
11 )

planned distribution
of the gold that is at the moment lying idle in the vaults
of the American banks. This planned distribution of gold
    

in all countries must be combined with the planned
distribution of orders, trade, supplies of scarce materials, in
general, with all-round economic aid for the ruined
countries.

12)

This aid may take the form of loans, since under a
planned economy the return of the money would begin in
a few years. Under this heading we place the Barter
Institute plan (Keynes), or the Zentralstelle, or national trade
centres. If Germany opposes us by a single Zentralstelle
in place of individual merchants it will be bad for us since
it would be a means of imposing bad goods on us at high
prices. If, however, the Zentralstellen are instruments
for the planned, world-wide distribution of essential
commodities

13)

and a means of rendering aid to weak countries by
the strong, they would be essential components of an
extensive programme of economic rehabilitation. The grain sent
to us by America is the beginning of the international
distribution of food. Within the Entente there was a
partially planned distribution of fuel during the war; one of the
chief elements of the broad programme should be the
systematic distribution of oil and coal, but in this case, too,
the element of compulsion and repression must be
eliminated. The international technical commissions must
elaborate, in very general outline, a programme for the
planned distribution of fuel and energy resources. All these
points, taken together, provide a picture of what is
theoretically possible under the bourgeois system, but which in
historically conditioned reality will come up against
national egoism and the predatory acts of the capitalist
oligarchy.

With communist greetings,


Georgi Chicherin

Comrade Sokolnikov

People’s Commissariat for Finance

Considering that the press, both Soviet and Party, had
earlier, namely, in connection with the
Glavzemkhoz[1]

    

exhibition from September 18 to 25, 1921, unanimously
assessed Comrade Runov’s work as being exceptionally
successful in founding proletarian agriculture, and
considering that this assessment had been confirmed by a decision
of the Council of Labour and Defence of 30/IX–1921,
I think that Runov’s enclosed application should be
unconditionally and fully
satisfied.[2]

I ask Comrade Sokolnikov to reply to me without delay,
in substance, through Comrade
Gorbunov.[3]

Comrade Sokolnikov:

Please write to me, 

1) whether you have received and read Comrade Belov’s
note: “Plan for Financial Campaign until the New Harvest
of 1922”, and your opinion.

2) How is supervision of the collection of cash taxes
arranged?

Give the facts on one page. What about the 10–day
reports? telegraphic or postal?

How many gubernias submit accurate reports?


Average percentage of arrears and from—to?

3) What is the arrangement for the State Bank’s
supervision over our lousy state trusts, in which adroit
swindlers dupe conscientious and totally canonised
Communists, chairmen of boards,
etc.?[1]

With communist greetings,

20/III.

Comrade Krasin:

I do not agree with you. Lezhava is a very nice comrade,
but he has fully demonstrated his weakness.

There is need for a different collegium (Politbureau),
and a trio inside it: you + Frumkin + Radchenko, because
you are away very often, and authority should reside in
Russia. What is more, you are also a diplomat. And you
are not doing any of the spade-work, purging the
swindlers, seeing to the order, flogging and thrashing for
non-fulfilment. You are responsible for the direction, but the

    

spade-work needs strong-minded men, and not Lezhava.
They will learn how to work.

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes

R.C.P.(B.) C.C., Krasin insisted that Lezhava should remain in the
post of Deputy People’s Commissar.

On March 20, 1922, the Politbureau, having discussed the
matter, recognised that “it is absolutely necessary both in the interests
of foreign trade itself and for considerations of foreign policy to
keep Comrade Krasin in the post of People’s Commissar for
Foreign Trade”, and appointed M. I. Frumkin to the post of Deputy
People’s Commissar. On March 27, the C.P.C. approved the
following Collegium: People’s Commissar—L. B. Krasin; Deputy
People’s Commissars—A. M. Lezhava and M. I. Frumkin; members
of the Collegium—I. I. Radchenko, P. S. Sorokin, A. V. Barsky
and K. M. Begge (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

21/III.1922.

Comrades Frumkin and Radchenko:

In a talk with me yesterday, Comrade Krasin expressed
the fear that both of you are freetraders, which is why the
future of the foreign-trade monopoly is being predetermined
in a negative sense. I protested most vigorously; I referred
to the fact that both of you are old Party men, tried and
tested in every way, and that there was not the slightest
ground for assuming that an absolutely precise directive
from the C.C. Politbureau (which confirmed the theses
recognising the foreign-trade monopoly) could be
unfulfilled by you. In addition, I expressed great doubt about
Comrade Frumkin being a “freetrader”. If Comrade
Radchenko had earlier spoken out (something I, too, had heard
from him) in the sense that the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Trade could “not cope” with the monopoly,
what he had in mind, first, was the unsatisfactory apparatus
of the P.C.F.T., which is the very thing we are now going
to improve, and, second, apparently, the “absolute”
monopoly of foreign trade, now substituted by a liberal
monopoly, a monopoly unconditionally and in any case.

I consider it my duty to inform you about that talk with
Krasin. Write me a couple of words. I hope that on the
basis of “mixed societies”, if we all, you especially, see
to it that there are no “compuppets”, communist puppets,
up there on top for the sake of appearances, while
specialists, swindlers, etc., handle all the business—that on this
basis we shall restructure the whole economy of trade and

    

restructure it precisely in the way necessary to ensure
socialist construction.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Frumkin:

I had just finished writing to you and
Radchenko,[1]

when
I received your
letter.[2] I cannot agree with you. The
Politbureau decision is precise, clear and, I believe,
correct.

What are your “differences of principle with Krasin”??
I should like to know. Are there any? What are they about?
Which are they?

Even if there are any in fact, that is no hindrance.

With Stomonyakov, you and Radchenko will make
arrangements here, now. You and Radchenko will each travel
abroad at least once a year. It is not far from here to
Berlin, and Berlin is the centre.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

M. I. Frumkin set out in the letter here mentioned of March 
21, 1922, his opinion of the state of affairs in the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade. He held that the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C. decision, including him on the Collegium of the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade and appointing Deputy
People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, was not appropriate for
several reasons, chiefly because of his “differences of principle
with Krasin on the main question—the nature of the foreign
trade monopoly”. Frumkin requested that ho should be allowed to
continue at the People’s Commissariat for Food (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

Comrades Stalin and Kamenev

I have received the draft of an additional resolution by
the
congress.[2]

I agree on the main points. After a first reading, I
propose these amendments:
 

1) away with the word “new” (page 1, line 1 from
bottom),

2) at the end, instead of “the congress authorises the
commission” say: “the Congress authorises the Central
Committee, with the enlistment of Comrades Tsyurupa and
Kiselyov (two non-members of the C.C.).”

I think:

a) also to propose less essential amendments;

b) add something on the subject of trying out men and
checking up on performance.

We shall arrange the details by phone.

How is this to be introduced?

I shall prepare a letter for the C.C. Plenum (by 24.IV?).

In this letter I will 

1) give a brief plan of the report,

2) refer to Trotsky’s
letter,[3] saying that I am
basically in favour,

3) tell about my arrangement with Tsyurupa and
Rykov,[1]


4) add your draft on my own behalf,

5) ask the C.C. Plenum to take a vote: do they approve
this? do they permit me to say all this on behalf of the
C.C. in my report?

P.S. This is the best form.

Add: against inflating the All-Russia C.E.C.: not more
than 3 per gubernia.

21/III–1922

Lenin
 

Notes

[2]
An apparent reference to the addition to the draft resolution on
the political report of the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.)
to the Eleventh Party Congress on demarcating the functions of
Party and Soviet, government organs (the text of the addition has
not been found). This question was inserted by Lenin into the plan
of the C.C.’s political report presented to the C.C. Plenum which
was held on March 25, 1922 (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 
251–53).





[3]
An apparent reference to Trotsky’s letter of March 10, 1922, on
the question of relations between Party and Soviet government
bodies, and the need to demarcate their functions, which was
sent to members of the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. in
connection with the discussion of Zinoviev’s draft theses, “On
Consolidating the Party”.

 To Comrade Molotov for Politbureau members

I have a letter from Solts, who has come out, on the
basis of the available experience, against the newspaper

    

Rabochy. He says it is used only to feed superfluous writers,
without in any sense producing a new type of newspaper or a
different readership. I think it would be more correct to
close down the newspaper, allowing it a short period for
liquidation, and to make use of the released manpower and
facilities to improve the existing
newspapers.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter was the result of a protest sent to the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C. by K. S. Yeremeyev, editor of the newspaper
Rabochy, over the directives issued by the Orgbureau of the
C.C. of March 6, 1922, to have the size of the paper reduced
and its nature, content, etc., changed.

On March 23, the Politbureau confirmed the Orgbureau

   

decision, and instructed the Central Committee’s Department for
Agitation and Propaganda to call a conference with the
participation of delegates to the Eleventh Party Congress to discuss
the publication of a popular newspaper for workers.

Rabochy (The Worker) was published by the R.C.P.(B.)
Central Committee from March 1, 1922; beginning with No. 98 of
July 1 it was called Rabochaya Gazeta, and was published until
January 1932.

30.III.1922
To Comrade Molotov for Politbureau members

I have had a talk with Krasnoshchekov. I see that we,
the Politbureau, have made a big mistake.

We have harassed this man, who undoubtedly has brains,
energy, knowledge and experience, to a state when one is
quite capable of abandoning everything and getting away
from the whole thing.

He knows all the languages, English excellently. He
has been in the movement since 1896. Fifteen years in
America. Started out as a house-painter. Was headmaster
of a school. Knows commerce. Has shown himself to be an
intelligent chairman of the government in the Far-Eastern
Republic, where he organised virtually
everything.[1]

We took him away from there. Here we placed him in the
People’s Commissariat for Finance, where complete
anarchy reigns. Now, just when he was down with the typhus,
he has been dismissed!!!

We have done everything possible and impossible to
repulse this highly energetic, intelligent and valuable
worker.

He has had differences both with the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the People’s Commissariat
for Finance, because he favoured greater “freedom to
trade”.

He says: “Let me prove myself at work, allow me to
complete it without keeping on at me.” That is, of course,
a legitimate desire.

We must make efforts to give him a job at the S.E.C.
At any rate, we mast strive at all costs not to lose this
worker, but to meet his most legitimate desire: give him a
specified job and allow him, say, at least one year of trial,
to test him without harassing him. (He says he is willing
to work anywhere, provided he is not pulled about.)

(He would like to work at the People’s Commissariat for

    

Foreign Affairs. He has had some differences with Chicherin
on the foreign policy of the Far-Eastern Republic.)

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Far-Eastern Republic, a democratic slate founded under
Bolshevik leadership during the working people’s struggle against
the foreign armed intervention in the Far East. It existed
from April 6, 1920 to November 14, 1922. The establishment
of the Far-Eastern Republic, a “buffer state” with a
bourgeois-democratic system, but essentially conducting a Soviet policy,
was in Soviet Russia’s interests as she was anxious to avoid an
open armed clash with the Japanese imperialists and wanted
to assure herself of a long breathing-space on the Eastern
Front.

Following the expulsion of the Japanese interventionists, the
People’s Assembly of the Far-Eastern Republic, on November 
15, 1922. requested the All-Russia C.E.C. to integrate it with
the R.S.F.S.R. and to extend the Soviet Constitution to its
territory. On November 15, 1922, the All-Russia C.E.C. declared
the Far-Eastern Republic to be an inseparable part of the
R.S.F.S.R.

Comrade Gorbunov:

The German doctors who have examined you say that
you need to be taken off your work at once, in view of which
I propose that you immediately hand over your duties for
the period of your leave and carry out all the doctors’
orders.

Comrade Tsyurupa has been assigned the task of seeing
that these instructions are carried out.

4/IV.1922

Comrade Rykov:

Please see to the business indicated by Comrade

Martens.[1] If it is confirmed that the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Affairs had impeded things, they should be
given exemplary punishment. Of course, we should be very
cautious about the immigration of workers to Russia, for,
on the other hand, we have very inadequate experience.
When all the formalities in the restrictive sense have been

    

observed, it is downright criminal to allow any delays,
for if the economic work is to be started, the immigrants
must arrive just now, before the spring operations begin.

Lenin

4/IV.1922

Comrade Rykov:

I am sending on to you a letter from
Yezhov,[1] who has
been recommended to me as an extremely reliable and
efficient worker. Unfortunately, I have been unable to carry
out my intention of making a closer acquaintance with
him. The warehouse business is in a shocking state and,
I believe, the whole is in the charge of Troyanovsky, whom
I remember as a Bolshevik during my stay abroad.
Subsequently, he went over to the Mensheviks, and now, it
seems, has deviated from the Mensheviks. I strongly suspect
that he is doing nothing about the warehouses, but is
engaged in politics, and that nothing good will come of his
warehouse activity. I think that Troyanovsky’s efficiency
should be thoroughly checked.

Lenin

passage, at a C.P.C. sitting, of the draft decision, which he had     
sent in at Lenin’s proposal, on the transfer, in accordance with      
a definite list, of warehouse premises from the charge of local

4/IV.

Comrade Sokolnikov:

I am sending you this confidentially; please return to
me with your reply.

I think that Alsky should be chased out (he is of no use);

    

Krasnoshchekov should be returned. He is right. The
policy has now been laid down; he can do nothing against you.

He will arrange the apparatus. There is no apparatus.
Alsky will never do this. I have a similar reference about
him from A. D. Tsyurupa. You are to give direction; you
will have no chance of dealing with the apparatus. You do
not have to appoint Krasnoshchekov to the Narrow C.P.C.

Please reply today, because I want to leave
tonight.[2]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written at the bottom of A. M. Krasnoshchekov’s
letter to the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. and to Lenin on
April 3, 1922. He described the state of affairs at the People’s
Commissariat for Finance and spoke of his differences over some

   

questions with Deputy People’s Commissar G. Y. Sokolnikov,
which, however, he did not consider serious enough, to warrant
his departure from, the People’s Commissariat. He requested
that the decision on his work should be expedited, and that if
it was impossible for him to stay on at the People’s
Commissariat for Finance he should be appointed a member of the S.E.C.
Presidium.





[2]
On April 6, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
adopted the following decision: =

“a) To instruct the C.C. Secretariat
to inform Comrade Krasnoshchekov that it has been decided
to send him to work either at the People’s Commissariat for
Finance or the S.E.C., allowing him a fortnight’s leave for his
complete recuperation.

“b) To refer the question of reinforcing the Collegium of the
People’s Commissariat for Finance and of using Comrade
Krasnoshchekov to the Orgbureau” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

By a decision of the Politbureau on April 13, 1922,
Krasnoshchekov was made a member of the S.E.C. Presidium. The
Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Finance was determined
at the same sitting.

This business of a concession granted to Rutgers and
a group of American workers, as Martens informs me, is
in a very bad state. This requires a check-up and serious
attention. It is an exceptional concession granted by us
to American workers by special permission of the
Politbureau.

The whole undertaking may go to pieces without special
support and check-up.

Please ask Martens for information and strictly check
up on the whole course of this business.

Please pay attention to the concession of the American
Hammer, who is now in Russia, as Reinstein, who knows
him personally, has informed me.

According to Martens, we’ve already made one great
blunder, to put it mildly, namely: the goods sent to
America under the contract with Hammer by the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade turned out to be of bad
quality. We must demand information about this business both
from the P.C.F.T. and the S.E.C. and also from Comrade
Reinstein, who knows Hammer personally. We must see to
it that our obligations under this concession are performed
with absolute strictness and accuracy, and in general we
must pay greater attention to the whole
business.[1]

Comrade Rykov
 Copy to Comrade Tsyurupa
 Copy to the C.P.C. Managing Department

I draw your attention to the exceptional importance of
the work of exploring the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly.
Comrade Krzhizhanovsky has informed me, that, according to
the engineers with whom he has talked, it has been Virtually
proved that we have there an incredibly rich reserve of
pure iron. Comrade Martens believes that it has been proved
already. He intends to go there within three weeks. We
must discuss whether we should send along with him some
engineer from the State Planning Commission with a better

    

knowledge of Russian conditions and who is capable of
checking up whether there is no exaggeration of any sort
there.

I think we should not let the press have any information
about this and should take steps to see that nothing is said
about this in the press, because otherwise we may expect
that the interventionist plans may very well be
intensified. For the same reason, perhaps, it would be better not
to have Martens’s report made either to the C.P.C. or the
C.L.D., but to have it heard only by both deputies, Bogdanov
and some C.C. members.

If the report of Martens and the engineer who is to go
with him on behalf of the S.P.C. confirms that the matter
is serious, we must get the work going as fast as possible,
without in any case stinting the necessary gold
appropriations, and establishing special supervision to have the
necessary equipment received from abroad (diamond,
drilling, etc.) with the maximum speed. I very much fear that
this business will be carried out without sufficient energy.
But the fact is, according to Krzhizhanovsky and Martens,
that we have there almost surely a stock of wealth
unequalled anywhere in the world, and capable of
revolutionising the whole of
metallurgy.[1]

This letter deals with the exploration of the Kursk Magnetic    
Anomaly (KMA).

Lenin displayed great interest in this work. His attention to          
the KMA and his help in its exploration can be seen from these         
documents and from the reminiscences of contemporaries, among          
them I. M. Gubkin and V. N. Rozanov (see Vospominaniya o           
V. I. Lenine, Part 2, Moscow, 1957, pp. 357–79, 402–04).

The C.P.S.U. Programme adopted by the Twenty-Second Party          
Congress provided for the establishment of a metallurgical base    
in the central European part of the U.S.S.R. using the ores of     
the KMA.

Comrade Krumin, Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn
 Comrade Krzhizhanovsky, State Planning Commission
 Comrade Popov, Central Statistical Board
 Comrade Smolyaninov

There has been no practical solution to the question of
studying local experience from the reports of the economic
conferences. The reports received by October 1 have not

    

been sufficiently made use of for practical work or for the
press and have riot been processed by the Central
Statistical Board. The fact is that only given a correct and
regular study of the reports (by the C.S.B., the S.P.C. and
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn) and publication of the results
of the study in the press is it possible to make the reports truly
most valuable material suitable for political and economic
conclusions. This task should be set before the S.P.C.,
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, the C.S.B. and the C.L.D. Managing
Department, and its fulfilment secured.

I authorise you to call a special conference and to
outline a programme for studying the
reports.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

V. A. Smolyaninov’s notes show that the study of the reports         
submitted by the local economic conferences was assigned to          
responsible workers of the State Planning Commission and the         
Central Statistical Board. Lenin, agreed to this with the proviso    
that the arrangements would be efficient and business-like, and      
asked for a list of these workers to be submitted to him at once.

Dear Comrade Varga:

reprint only my articles (the old ones); extracts from my
spring 1918
article[1]

(already printed in the pamphlet on
the tax in
kind[2]

)

would be important. Perhaps, too (by
way of exception), some passages from my speech at the
1922 Party Congress: but I myself have been unable to read
the speech in the press: the whole thing might be terribly
distorted. Please make sure that you show me beforehand
the extracts (well edited by some competent comrade!)
you intend to
reprint.[3]


Best regards,


Yours,

I confirm the above. I have known Comrade Adoratsky
(and I know him we’ll) since the post–1905 period of reaction.
In face of the trend to the right, he was a Bolshevik
already at the lime, and has remained one. He arrived from
Germany in 1919 in very poor health. He is a theorist and
propagandist. I should think it absolutely right to date
his membership in the R.C.P. from 1904.

He is working on a collection of Marx’s selected letters,
a work we have discussed together.

It is my earnest request that he be rendered all possible
assistance, supplied with the necessary books, and, in
particular, that he be given the opportunity of working at
the Socialist Academy for about 4 hours every morning,
and of using its library.

Comrade Adoratsky:

I am enclosing what you have
requested.[1]

I am writing
to
Kamenev.[2]

I am ill and will probably be unable to see
you or help with Marx’s letters. Kamenev will help you;
so you will have someone to consult with. Concentrate on
the letters: this is an important international undertaking.
Select the most important ones. The notes should be brief,
clear and precise (+ a comparison of Marx’s comments
with those of such-and-such “authoritative” bourgeois
reactionary scientists).

Regards!

Yours,


Lenin

Dear Vladimir Ilyich:

... I should very much like to carry on and
complete the initial plan, namely, to compile

now much more confident, because I have gained
greater mastery of the subject....

I should like to see you and discuss some of

my doubts. If this is possible, call me. I am
always at the Central Archives, 8 Vagankovsky,
telephones 1–78–38 or 1–75–86. 

It would be well if you wrote me a paper or
something,

have
written[1]

saying that I have been authorised to
do this work, and that I should be given
assistance at the Socialist Academy in my studies there.
If I were able to devote 4 hours or so to the work
at the Socialist Academy every morning, I could
have everything ready for the printer’s within a
couple of months. I do not quite understand what
means assigning “the concern” about the letters

# Sometimes it
also pays to do
this!

to Comrade Kamenev. If it means giving me a
shove now and then to keep me from forgetting

about them, that is not necessary—I remember
it very well. If it means assistance, consultation
and help—that would be really fine. I should be
very glad to be able to consult with someone.

can’t.

But I should like to have your final review and

arrangement. The publication is to be in chronological

April 12, 1922

Comrades Rykov and Tsyurupa

I request you to call a conference of deputy commissars
this very day to work out practical and most vigorous
measures for getting the Kashira Station to start supplying
electric current to Moscow. It is quite an intolerable
outrage when a ready station, with all the lines strung up,
is unable to supply the current because of our
administrative
muddle.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On April 21, 1922, the C.L.D., having recognised “the need,
in the interests of supplying electric power to Moscow, to have
the Kashira Power Station switched into Moscow’s general
power supply system as soon as possible”, instructed the Supreme
Council for Transportation and the People’s Commissariat for
Railways urgently to provide the Kashira Power Station with
fuel to ensure its uninterrupted operation (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee). See Collected Works, fifth (Russian) Edition,
Vol. 54, Document 92.

   Comrades Stalin, Kamenev and Trotsky

Litvinov’s telegram on the signing of the agreement  with
Germany[1] raises the question of whether it is appropriate to

    

publish this right away or to postpone it until there is
more clarity on whether or not a break at Genoa is
inevitable.[2] I believe this question should be settled this very
day.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the treaty concluded by Soviet Russia with
Germany on April 16, 1922, at Rapallo, near Genoa, during
the Genoa Conference.

Lenin gave an assessment of the Rapallo Treaty in his “Draft
Decision of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on the
Report of the Delegation to the Genoa Conference” (see present
edition, Vol. 33, pp. 356–57).

The All-Russia C.E.C., in a decision on the delegation’s report
adopted on May 17, 1922, recognised “only this type of treaty
as being normal for the R.S.F.S.R.’s relations with capitalist
states” (III sessia Vserossiiskogo Tsentralnogo Ispolnitelnogo
Komiteta IX sozyva. Bulleten No. 5, 19 maia 1922 goda, p. 17).
The report on the signing of the Rapallo Treaty was published
in Izvestia VTsIK No. 85 of April 19.





[2]
A reference to the situation which had taken shape at the Genoa
Conference.

On April 11, 1922, the Soviet delegation was handed the
“experts’ report” worked out at a conference of experts from Great
Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and Japan in London in March
(London Memorandum). It contained demands that the Soviet
Government should pay all the debts of the tsarist and
Provisional governments and all the authorities which had existed in
Russia, return to foreigners their former property which had been
nationalised by the Soviet state, or compensate them for the
damage inflicted on their property, or for the loss of it, and
establish economic and legal privileges for foreigners, and a number
of other demands which in fact meant abolition of the foreign
trade monopoly.

The official reply of the Soviet delegation to the “experts’
report” was set out in its memorandum of April 20. The Soviet
delegation firmly rejected these demands, qualifying them as
an attempt to “introduce in Russia a system of capitulations
encroaching on her sovereignty” (Dokumenty vneshnei politiki
SSSR, Vol. V, Moscow, 1961, p. 235), and put forward
counter-claims for compensation of the losses inflicted on Russia by the
foreign intervention, stressing that the R.S.F.S.R. Government
was prepared to negotiate on compensation of the losses of
foreign citizens only on the basis of reciprocity.

     Comrade Zinoviev

Top secret

Not to be retyped

Comrade Zinoviev:

Please raise at the Executive Committee of the Comintern
(I am not sure whether it should be raised at an enlarged
sitting or at a sitting of the narrow bureau) the question
of sending a special correspondent or several correspondents
from the Comintern to South Africa to collect the most
detailed information and the fullest set of local literature,
both legal and illegal, relating to the recently suppressed
workers’ uprising. This should be done as soon as possible,
and not otherwise than with the maximum precautions
because the British are sure [to do
everything][1]

to prevent
the slightest possibility of any contact between us and the
insurgents who have not yet been shot or
jailed.[2]

We, for our part, should at all costs establish the rule
that Comintern agents should manage to put in a secret
appearance at all places of such uprisings to make timely
collection of the fullest material on the history of the
uprising 

Please reply in a couple of words.

Lenin

[2]
A reference to the uprising of white miners in Witwatersrand,
Union of South Africa, in March 1922, which was sparked off by
the mining companies’ intensified exploitation of the miners.
Following a drop in the world price of gold, the companies tried
to maintain their old profit margins by pressing down wages
and massive sackings. The workers took over the cities of Benoni
and Branpan, and the suburbs of Johannesburg—Fordsburg and
Jeppe. The young Communist Party of South Africa took an
active part in the uprising. Many Communists, including the strike
leaders, Fischer and Spendiff, died as heroes in the armed
struggle.

Comrades Stalin, Kamenev and Trotsky

I propose that we send the following telegram (and
communicate to the editorial boards of Pravda and Izvestia
as a directive to our press):

“To Chicherin and Sosnovsky

“All information from Genoa indicates that we are
succumbing to deceit. Lloyd George, who is making noises
against France, is covering up his main urge—to force us
to pay debts in general and those to the former owners in
particular. It is time we started a systematic exposure of
this old manoeuvre by British diplomats, doing this both
in our press and the communist press
abroad.”[1]

Notes

Lenin’s proposal, which is contained in the published document,
was adopted by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on April 
19, 1922. Thai same day, the telegram was sent through the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to G. V. Chicherin and
L. S. Sosnovsky, and also to the editorial boards of Pravda and

Comrade Stalin

Please have the following telegram of mine sent to
Chicherin, if the Politbureau members have no objection.

“To Comrade Chicherin

“I have never had any doubts that Lloyd George is
acting under the pressure of British sharks and that.
Britain will not stay on without France, but I think that this
should not alter our policy in the slightest, and that we
should not be afraid of the conference breaking up. We

    

cannot accept recognition of the private debts under any
circumstances. I think I know the actual situation.

Lenin”

This telegram of Lenin’s sent to Genoa on April 21, 1922, was
in reply to G. V. Chicherin’s telegram of April 20, objecting
to Lenin’s assessment of the situation at the conference and
saying that it, was “in fact mainly Lloyd George himself who had
an interest” in the question of compensating foreigners for the
losses arising from the nationalisation of their property, “because
pressure was being brought to bear on him by the almighty
British sharks” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

April 24, 1922
Comrade Stalin for the Politbureau

Rudzutak’s telegram protesting against the letter sent
to Lloyd George shows, I believe, that Chicherin either has
already made or is quite capable of making an obvious
mistake and of violating a C.C. directive. The mistake
consists in the fact that Chicherin, without achieving
anything in practice, could well deprive us of the only
explanation of a break-up which is quite advantageous and
important in principle and which gives us a sure gain in
the future: namely, a break-up over our refusal to restore
the private property of foreign, capitalists.

I propose, therefore, that the Politbureau members
should be polled by phone today, and that the following
telegram should be sent on my behalf:

“To Chicherin for all the members of the delegation 

“I consider Rudzutak’s opinion, stated in his telegram
of April 22, to be quite correct. I regard as a very dangerous
mistake any step and any phrase capable of depriving us of
the only advantageous ground for a break-up, which,
besides, assures us of complete diplomatic and commercial
victory in the very near future, namely, the ground that
we absolutely refuse to restore the private property of the
foreign capitalists.
 

“I repeat once again that we have communicated to you
the absolutely exact text of our maximum concessions, from
which we will not depart in the least. As soon as it
becomes quite clear that agreement on the basis of these
concessions is impossible, we authorise you to break-off,
retaining for agitation and for a subsequent diplomatic
offensive two trumps:

“1) The fundamental importance of the Russo-German
treaty.

“2) Our divergence on the question of restoring the
capitalists’ property.”

Please, let me know the opinion of all or at any rate
of a majority of the Politbureau
members.[1]

At 7 o’clock tonight let us meet together, and if
possible with Kamenev as well, for a quarter of an hour.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On April 24, 1922, the text of the telegram to G. V. Chicherin,
proposed by Lenin, was approved by the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C.

Lenin’s assessment of the stand taken by Lloyd George and
other British leaders, given in the telegrams to Genoa (see this
volume, Documents 704 and 705), was borne out in the course
of the conference. The British delegation subsequently even went
back on the understanding that Chicherin’s letter of April 20
would be taken as a basis for continuing the talks. In a letter
addressed to the conference chairman on April 28, Chicherin
pointed out that if the Western Powers repudiated their
-agreement to consider the points in the April 20 letter as a basis for
negotiations, the Soviet delegation would not regard itself as
being bound by this letter and would return to the standpoint
set out in its April 20 memorandum (see Dokumenty vneshnei
politiki SSSR, Vol. V, Moscow, 1961, pp. 276–77).

26.IV.1922

Top secret
Comrades Rykov and Tsyurupa

I am sending you Varga’s German letter.

I am sure that we have a great many scandalous things
of this kind.

Varga is apparently right (I have written to him to say
that in future he must let me know his informant’s name).
Please appoint (through Krestinsky? or otherwise) a strict
inquiry at Berlin to catch the guilty persons at this B.F.S.T.
and then to reorganise it radically.

Make sure that Yevgeny Varga is on the commission for
inquiry and
restructuring.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On the commission to examine the activity of the B.F.S.T. (Bureau    
for Foreign Science and Technology) were Y. B. Pashukanis,           
Y. S. Varga (representing the embassy), V. N. Ipatiev,               

   

M. Y. Lapirov-Skoblo, B. E. Stuynkel (representing the S.E.C.)     
and V. V. Starkov (representing the foreign trade mission).

In its conclusion, the commission described the state of the    
B.F.S.T., making a number of criticisms, and came out in        
favour of retaining it but on a much smaller scale.

Comrade Stalin:

I am sending on to you a letter from Comrade Shklovsky
(G. L. Shklovsky). I knew him very well while abroad
(1908–1914), where he emigrated being already a Bolshevik
and a Party member. He wants to work in Russia and in the
Party. He used to work in Moscow—in the city
administration (Vladimirsky saw him on the job), and at the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and at the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture; it seems he quite “hit it
off” only with the People’s Commissariat for Foreign
Affairs, where he was valued. In the other places he was either
not in tune or not in full tune, or something of that sort,
for it turned out that it was impossible for him to arrange
for work in Russia. Shklovsky is a veteran Party man, and
he is extremely upset (as his letter shows) that he is “not
being allowed” to work in Russia. He is nervous, he has
fears that he is being “put off”, etc. (He has a family and
children; it is not easy to adapt oneself to cold and
starving Russia. Both Zinoviev and Safarov and all those
who were in Switzerland in 1908–1917 knew Shklovsky
abroad.)

Please write yourself or have your secretary write to
Shklovsky (through Krestinsky in Berlin), asking him what
he would like, and then raise the question in the
Secretariat. People should not be “squandered”, he should be
given the closest
attention.[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The following day, April 28, 1922, C.P.C. secretary Natalya
Lepeshinskaya wrote under the text of Lenin’s letter: “Sent to
Comrade Shklovsky a letter signed by Stalin, inquiring what kind
of work he would like to do, and saying that the C.C. would
always meet his wishes in this respect.”

The register of Lenin’s outgoing documents contains the
following secretarial entry under the head “Execution”: “Replied
17.V.22. Shklovsky is satisfied with Stalin’s offer.”

Only one thing should be done right away: send a coded
telegram to Chicherin requesting a summary or theses for
a manifesto.

Lenin

Written on April 28, 1922

     

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with the following proposal introduced
by Trotsky in the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on April 
28, 1922: =

“1) to issue a statement for agitational purposes to the
effect that if the Entente governments should confiscate all the
capital of the Russian capitalists abroad, the Soviet
Government would undertake not to raise any protest, =

2) to issue a
manifesto to the population in the event of a break-up of the talks
at the Genoa Conference.” =

Lenin underlined this sentence from
Trotsky’s note: “We should ask our delegation to let, us have
an outline of their main ideas for such a manifesto (otherwise
we may well miss some important aspects)” and wrote in the
margin: “I agree only with the last sentence.”

That same day, the Politbureau adopted this decision: =

“To
send a telegram to Comrades Chicherin and Litvinov to this effect:
‘In the event of a break-up we consider it, necessary to issue a
manifesto to the population on behalf of the C.P.C. or the
All-Russia C.E.C. Please outline a draft of the manifesto or the
main ideas for one, and send urgently to Moscow’” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).

In the subsequent course of the talks, the need for a manifesto
disappeared.

I propose the dispatch of the following telegram:
To Stomonyakov

“Discuss with Krestinsky and Lomonosov measures to
influence Krupp. Inform about decision. Act only on
unanimous decision of all
three.”[2]
 

Notes
 

[1]
There is a typewritten copy of this document with a printed  signature of Lenin.—Ed.
 



[2]
The telegram was drafted by Lenin under the text of a letter from
B. S. Stomonyakov, R.S.F.S.R. trade representative in
Germany, to the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C., of April 22,
1922. Stomonyakov reported that the directors of “Friedrich
Krupp in Essen” had refused to approve the agreement on an
agricultural concession in Salsk District, Don Region, which
their representative had signed in Moscow on March 23, 1922
(see Note 621). In view of the fact that Krupp plants were
working on the railway mission’s orders for locomotives for Soviet
Russia, Stomonyakov requested that instructions be sent to the
head of the mission, Y. Y. Lomonosov, to join the trade mission
in finding “ways of influencing Krupp and to start applying them”.


The same day, the Politbureau decided to send Stomonyakov
the telegram here published.

After additional Sulks with the company, and specification, of
the terms of the agreement, the C.P.C. on January 16, 1923,
approved the agreement with Krupp which was presented by the
Chief Concessions Committee, and on March 17, the agreement
was signed by Krupp. The concession was in force until
October 1934.

The best thing for us is another conference in about three
months or so. At the closing of the Genoa Conference do
not in any case undertake the slightest financial
obligation, do not make even a semi-recognition of the debts,
and do not be afraid of a break-up in general. Comrade
Krasin’s minority opinion shows that his line is absolutely
wrong and inadmissible. Regardless of the course and

    

outcome of the financial negotiations, once again bring out
strongly to the fore the question of the mutual obligation
to maintain peace, and support it even if it has the
unsatisfactory form given to it by Lloyd George.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The telegram was received by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
C.C. on April 30, 1922, and sent on to G. V. Chicherin. It was
in reply to Chicherin’s telegrams saying that the “Russian
question” was to be referred to another conference to be held within
three months, and also in reply to Chicherin’s telegrams
communicating L. B. Krasin’s minority opinion on the talks at the
Genoa Conference. Krasin suggested some serious concessions.

In reply to Lenin’s telegram, Chicherin admitted that another
conference within three months was preferable to a complete
break-up, but added: “Lloyd George is working for an agreement
with us, and three months from now the situation in Britain may
be much worse for us.” Ho went on to say that the Allies were
prepared to have concrete discussions on granting Soviet Russia
a credit only after the Soviet Government agreed to pay
compensation to all foreigners who had formerly owned property in
Russia (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

In view of the unprecedentedly disgraceful and dangerous
hesitations of Chicherin and Litvinov (to say nothing of
Krasin) I propose this castigation.

My draft:

“We highly regret that both Chicherin and Litvinov in
part have slid down to Krasin’s absurdities. In view of
such hesitations we order the delegation to break
unconditionally and as soon as possible, clearly and precisely
motivating it by the refusal to restore private property,
and to declare that we agreed to make partial concessions
only on condition of a very advantageous and immediate
loan, unconditionally insisting on a treaty between two
systems of property, as between equals. (In the event of
the slightest further hesitations we shall disavow you
publicly in the Central Executive Committee and dismiss you
from your office.) Litvinov’s open telegram clearly shows
that they want to fool us.”

Lenin. 2/V

I do not agree with Stalin’s amendment to delete the
threat of disavowal. Lenin

Comrade Stalin:

I propose another addition to the telegram to Genoa:

A session of the All-Russia C.E.C. has been set for May 
12. By then, at least three members of the delegation must

    

be in Moscow with all the material. Chicherin is to stay
in Germany and complete his
treatment.[2]

Lenin. 2/V
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This was written in connection with the receipt from Genoa of
a number of communications which aroused the fear that in their
talks with the Allied powers Chicherin and Litvinov might
make concessions not provided for in the C.C. directives.





[2]
On May 2, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
discussed this proposal. It adopted the following amendments
motioned by Stalin to the draft telegram introduced by Lenin:
1) delete the sentence about disavowal; =

2) end the telegram with
these words: “The C.C. categorically demands fulfilment of this
directive.” On Stalin’s motion, the word “absurdities” in the first
sentence was replaced by the word “mistakes”. The Politbureau
adopted the addition to the telegram without any changes.

Copies to Comrade Rykov and Comrade Tsyurupa

Comrade Dzerzhinsky:

Please inform me—in the briefest form—whether
anything is being done and how quickly to carry out the C.L.D.
decision on classifying the railways in three categories
and closing down the railways in the third category.

The closure should be speeded up to the maximum, and
secured quickly and at all costs. How else are we to fight
the
crisis?[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.L.D.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
By a C.L.D. decision on October 21, 1921, the railway network
was classified in three categories with respect to supply.

In reply to Lenin’s inquiry, the People s Commissar for
Railways, F. E. Dzerzhinsky, sent him on May 4, 1922, a detailed
report drawn up at his Commissariat, and also a letter informing
him of implementation of the C.L.D. decision. For Dzerzhinsky’s
letter see Istorichesky Arkhiv No. 1, 1962, pp. 58–59.

Copies to Comrades Tsyurupa,


Rykov and Stalin (for the Politbureau)

Comrade Sokolnikov:

I have heard Comrade Tsyurupa’s account of your project
for an internal grain loan, and have looked over the draft
text myself. This looks to me like self-deception. How
can you prove that this will yield anything practical at
all? It seems to me that, on the contrary, we should
conclude that this will worsen our situation by wrecking the
emission, i.e., inducing the speculative market to resort
to the very measure of fighting against us which it has been
using with such success. In fact, the market has learned,
it seems, to inflate prices following the growth of emission
so fast that the emission has ceased to extract any real
values from the population whatsoever, becoming an empty
game and empty self-consolation on our part. (By the way,
there should be precise data about the real values being
extracted through the emission. They should be summed up
in the briefest form at least weekly. Is this being
done?)

I think it is time we abandoned the harmful
self-consolation, and turned to really revolutionary measures, on the
one hand—an increase in the collection of all taxes; on
the other hand—a most rapid and vigorous reduction of
staffs. In doing this, we should not stop at closing down,
partly without any designation of date, partly until the
autumn, of a number of the largest departments in some
People’s Commissariats, and even of this or that People’s
Commissariat.

I wrote to Dzerzhinsky today to check up on whether
we are seriously working to close down the third category
railways. I very much fear that without revolutionary
measures of this kind the congress resolution on  financial
policy[1] remains on paper, and that in general we are

    

lagging behind life, risking to find ourselves helpless in
face of the impending disaster.
Let me have your
opinion.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the resolution of the Eleventh Congress of the
R.C.P.(B.), “On Financial Policy” (see KPSS v rezolutsiyakh
i resheniyakh syezdov, konferentsii i plenumov TsKa, Part I, 1954,
pp. 613–18).





[2]
In a reply letter to Lenin on May 4, 1922, G. Y. Sokolnikov
argued that, the issue of a grain loan would facilitate
implementation of the effective measures proposed by Lenin to produce a
balanced budget, reduce the amount of newly issued money (the
bank-note emission), and withdraw a part of the money already
in circulation.

On May 13, 1922, the C.P.C. approved the draft decision on
the grain loan, and submitted it for examination by the Third
Session of the All-Russia C.E.C. The first internal short-term
grain loan was issued by the People’s Commissariat for Finance,
under a decision of the All-Russia C.E.C. of May 20, 1922, to a
total amount, of up to 10 million poods of rye (in grain) with
repayments by the state from December 1, 1922 to January 31,
1923 (see Izvestia VTsIK No. 112, May 21, 1922).

At present, before the question has been prepared, this
will be purely bureaucratic and harmfully bureaucratic.

Preparations should be started at once in every way in
a number of
commissions.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with the project to set up a People’s
Commissariat for Internal Trade.

Having discussed this question on May 3, 1922, the C.L.D.
found it necessary to appoint a special commission for internal
trade. On May 5, the C.L.D. resolved: “For the purpose of
regulating questions of internal trade, to set up under the C.L.D. a
three-man commission to be appointed by the C.L.D.” This was
approved by the C.P.C. on May 9, 1922 (Sobraniye uzakonenii
i rasporyazhenii rabochego i krestyanskogo pravitelstva, 1922,

Be sure to make a break and quickly over the new  allied
memorandum,[1] because we shall allow no concession to
the owners, and a better opportunity will not be found.
Delays weaken us. With the German treaty in hand, we
shall now never abandon a long-term effort to stand only
on its basis. Start a highly circumspect flirtation with Italy
separately.

This telegram has been directed to the Politbureau quite
wrongly. This matter should be decided through Soviet
government channels. Such a telegram must be dispatched

    

with the signature of both deputy chairmen, the chairman
or deputy chairman of the Concessions Committee and,
finally, the head of the Central Fuel Administration. These
are the persons who are alone responsible, and should
normally be responsible for the accuracy of the figures given
here, and for seeing that the instructions issued here
conform with statutes and decrees issued by the Soviet
institutions concerned. I therefore refuse to vote on the
substance of this
telegram.[1]

The reply was sent on May 8, 1922, and was signed by Deputy
C.P.C. Chairman, A. I. Rykov.

We should think that the generally unacceptable nature
of the latest memorandum of the powers is a suitable
pretext for a break-off, but if you do not agree with this, we
consent, considering a break-up predetermined, to leave
it to your discretion to find the most suitable moment for
the break.

The telegram, adopted by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)            

C.C. on May 8, 1922, was written in reply to M. M. Litvinov’s         

telegram of May 6, saying that the Allied memorandum of May 2         

was not an ultimatum, but left open the possibility of continuing     

negotiations, and that the Soviet delegation at Genoa was making      

efforts to avoid a break-up of the talks, and spoke of the need to    

have Politbureau directives on the line the delegation was to         

take.

Considering the importance of the Russo-German treaty,
its acceptance by Germany, its influence on Italy, and the
dogfight between the powers over oil concessions, we arrive
at the conclusion that it would be most correct for us now
to build up all our foreign policy on everything resting,
over a certain period of at least a few months, only on the
Russo-German treaty, declaring it to be the only specimen
from which we shall depart only for the sake of

    

exceptionally great advantages. Try to prepare this through the form
of break. Together with the ratification of the
Russo-German treaty we want to include such a statement in the
declaration of the All-Russia C.E.C. Urgently telegraph
your opinion.

About Goikhbarg, I have had a number of complaints
saying that as chairman he browbeats and intimidates the
public. In other respects, I personally value Goikhbarg
highly. Perhaps this could be checked or he specially

Dear Comrade Hammer!

Excuse me please; I have been very ill; now I am much,
much better.

Many thanks for Your present—a very kind letter from
American comrades and friends who are in prison. I enclose
for You my letter to Comrade Zinoviev or for other comrades
in Petrograd if Zinoviev has left Petrograd.

My best wishes for the full success of Your first
concession: such success would be of great importance also for
trade relations between our Republic & United States.
 

Thanking You once more. I beg to apologise for my bad
English. Please address letters & telegrams to my
secretary (Fotieva or Smolianinoff). I shall instruct
them.[1]


Yours truly,


Lenin

I beg You to help the comrade Armand Hammer; it is
extremely important for us that his first concession would
be a full success.

Yours,

Lenin
 

I beg you to give every assistance to the bearer, Comrade
Armand Hammer, an American comrade, who has taken
out the first concession. It is extremely, extremely
important that his whole undertaking should be a complete
success.

Telephone message to Zinoviev and his deputy
 in Petrograd (make sure this is not lost in the
 event of Zinoviev’s departure or
absence)[2]

Today I wrote a letter of reference to you and your
deputy for the American Comrade Armand Hammer. His father
is a millionaire and a Communist (he is in prison in
America). He has taken out our first concession, which is very
advantageous for us. He is going to Petrograd to be present
at the discharge of the first wheat
ship[1]

and to arrange for
the receipt of machinery for his concession ((asbestos
mines)).

It is my earnest request that you issue orders at once
to see that there is no red tape and that reliable comrades
should personally keep an eye on the progress and speed
of all operations for this concession. This is of the utmost
importance. Armand Hammer is travelling with the
director of his company, Mr. Mishell.

Hammer made on May 11, 1922. Over the text Lenin wrote: “Make

Comrade Dovgalevsky
 Copy to the C.P.C. Managing Department

Comrade Dovgalevsky:

I read in Izvestia today that the Nizhni-Novgorod City
Soviet has petitioned the All-Russia C.E.C. to award the
Order of the Red Banner of Labour to the Nizhni-Novgorod
Radio Laboratory, and to enter the names of Prof. 
Bonch-Bruyevich and Prof. Vologdin on the Honour Board.

Let me know your opinion. I, for my part, would consider
it necessary to support the petition.

Incidentally, in connection with your letter to me, please
let me know whether you are quite satisfied with the work
of the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory; also send me,
if possible, the briefest comment from Bonch-Bruyevich
about the progress of his work in making the megaphones
capable of broadcasting to the masses what comes in over
the wireless telephone. This work is of exceptional
importance for us because its success, which Bonch-Bruyevich
promised long ago, would be of enormous benefit to
agitation and propaganda.

It is necessary, therefore, to make some sacrifices to
back this work. In particular, I have heard that in
America such work has already resulted in practical success.

There should be a check to see whether the
Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory has at its disposal all the latest
American literature on this question.

Please let me have your opinion as soon as possible,
to give me time, in case of need, to sign any required
communication or petition at the All-Russia C.E.C. session
which opens
tomorrow.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Also please inform me in a separate confidential letter
about some of the details of Nikolayev’s removal from
the office of head of the radio department to another post;
and also about what qualification Comrade Trofimov, who,

    

I believe, is now in charge of the department, has for doing
so; also about the qualification of the specialist who is
directly responsible for this work at the central
department.[2]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

V. S. Dovgalevsky informed Lenin the same day that “Prof.
Bonch-Bruyevich’s radiotelephone would be installed for
operation in Moscow in early June”, adding that he considered it
“desirable and just to give special mention to the work of the
Nizhni-Novgorod Laboratory and of Professors Bonch-Bruyevich
and Vologdin, and to support the petition of the Nizhni-Novgorod
Soviet... ”.

On September 19, 1922, the Secretariat of the All-Russia C.E.C.
resolved: “To award the Order of the Red Banner of Labour to
the Nizhni-Novgorod Laboratory and, giving special mention to the
services of Professors Vologdin and Bonch-Bruyevich and senior
mechanic Shorin, to express gratitude to them on behalf of the
All-Russia C.E.C.”





[2]
The next day, May 12, 1922, People’s Commissar for Posts and
Telegraphs, V. S. Dovgalevsky, gave a detailed account of

   

A. M. Nikolayev’s removal from the post of head of the
technical administration, and described the efficiency of K. V.
Trofimov who was appointed instead. He said Nikolayev was
charged with general administration, whose functions included
finance and organisational questions.

Find out the amount he expected to receive and what he

This is an addition, headed “From Lenin”, to the telegram
signed by A. I. Rykov. Rykov reported the difficulties in
transporting coal from Donbas because of a shortage of rolling stock
and locomotives and the bad state of the railway tracks. He
asked that measures should be taken to conclude an agreement
with Italian companies for the sale of coal to them at favourable
prices.

If we have correctly understood the press comments over
the situation created by our reply, Lloyd George is
prepared to separate an immediate political agreement on peace
from financial-economic agreements which are to be
referred to a long
commission.[3] This would be the best
outcome and an unquestionable victory, that is why we
recommend:
1) to continue the absolutely uncompromising
line in the economic sphere, agreeing to a long commission,
2) to give every support to Lloyd George in his urge for a
political agreement (guarantee, treaty),
3) in every way to
strive for separate agreements with various countries,
4) to make every possible use of Lloyd George’s approach to
the question of the eastern boundaries of Poland and
Rumania, indicating that these boundaries are obstacles to
the establishment of peace, but this should be done
cautiously, so as not to draw criticism about departures from the
Riga
Treaty.[4] We repeat our request that you urgently
communicate to us basic propositions for an All-Russia
C.E.C. resolution on Joffe’s report, especially in
connection with the Rapallo Treaty—see our telegram
No. 3535/c.[1]

The telegram proposed by Lenin was adopted by the Politbureau
of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on May 14, 1922, and sent to G. V.
Chicherin.





[3]
A reference to the memorandum of the Soviet delegation of May 
11, 1922.

In pursuance of the directives of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C., the
delegation rejected the demands of the Entente countries, declaring
that unless they recognised the principle of reciprocity, Soviet
Russia would not make concessions. It proposed that a mixed
expert committee should be set up to study the controversial
financial matters.

Thus, the negotiations at Genoa were broken off through the
fault of the Entente powers, which refused to repudiate their
colonialist altitude towards Soviet Russia.

The activity of the Soviet delegation was approved by the
All-Russia C.E.C. session, which on May 17 adopted a
resolution on A. A. Joffe’s report. The resolution was drafted by
Lenin (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 356–57).





[4]
The Riga Peace Treaty was signed on March 18, 1921, by Russia
and the Ukraine, on the one hand, and Poland, on the other (see
Dokumenty me shut I politiki SSSR, Vol. V, Moscow, 1961, p. 401).

15/V.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

I have to reprove you and Comrade Zaks—with the
warning that stricter penalties will be applied next time—over
the fact that having checked up on the work of Comrade
Ulrikh, who for several months now has been following the

    

execution of the C.P.C. and C.L.D. decisions, I discovered
immense disorder.

The card, which is here enclosed, defines the form and
order of Comrade Ulrikh’s work. You will see, however,
that this is not being fulfilled; neither you nor Zaks have
seen to this, although it is your primary duty to do so. I
have instructed Comrade Ulrikh to fill in the card with the
strictest accuracy, severely to the point of pedantism.

I charge you, together with Comrade Zaks, to secure the
most precise fulfilment of this; if Comrade Ulrikh fails
to learn, she should he replaced, and an absolutely
accurate worker found.

The enclosed cards show that Comrade Fotieva has also
started, like Comrade Ulrikh, to alter the card on her own.
This I absolutely do not allow. Only deputy chairmen, by
their joint signatures, have the right to prescribe or permit
any alteration of the card. Any other alterations should
entail dismissal from office.

It is better to verify only a part of the C.P.C. and C.L.D.
decisions (as marked off by the deputies or business manager),
but they should be verified with pedantic accuracy.

It is the duty of every People’s Commissar at once to
appoint several comrades with responsibility for verifying
execution (business manager, his assistant; secretary, his
assistant, etc.) and to communicate their names to the
C.P.C. and C.L.D. business manager. For negligence these
persons should be relentlessly punished by arrest or
dismissed by order of the deputies. For carelessness, a People’s
Commissar should be punished by a reprimand, simple or
with entry in his Party card. To watch over this—most
strictly—is the duty of the C.P.C. business manager, and
I will not hesitate to dismiss him from his post, unless
he fulfils this with pedantic precision.

The task is to teach the People’s Commissariats to be
accurate, jailing and dismissing the careless workers.

What has been said about the People’s Commissariats
applies to all the separate institutions (State Planning
Commission, Central Statistical Board, Concessions
Committee, People’s Commissariat for Internal Trade, etc.)
and to the gubernia executive committees, regional
economic conferences, etc.
 

You and Zaks shall have the duty twice a month to write
me (briefly, in telegraphic style) about how the accurate
verification of execution is organised. Failure to do so
will entail dismissal.

I enclose the cards filled in by Comrade Fotieva (which
she has done carelessly and inadmissibly) and the clean
cards corrected by me: don’t dare dirty them, don’t dare
make any unnecessary entries, don’t dare make the
slightest departures. Otherwise, I shall sack both the secretaries
and all the business managers.

Show this paper to both deputies at once. Have them
sign (before my departure, i.e., within not more than 3 or
4 days) a most precise order on how, in accordance with my
instructions, they are to verify execution, fill in the cards,
and punish for carelessness.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.

Comrades Stalin and Frumkin:

I think that we should issue an official ban on all talks
and conversations and Commissions, etc., on weakening
the foreign trade monopoly.

I do not agree with Frumkin that state trade will always
be beaten. Throughout the world it is the department stores
that beat everyone else. Yet, in what way are they better
than state trade?

There is need systematically to go over to bonuses for
employees for turnover and profit. Unless this is done the
People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade (and all of us)
will be a flop. Frumkin does not think about this, and that
is his fault.

15/V. Lenin
 

Send this confidentially to Stalin and Frumkin,
requesting them to return it with a couple of words of comment.
See that it is returned as soon as possible (2–3
days).[1]

For comment by Rykov and Tsyurupa.

I object to the merger of the People’s Commissariats.
We should confine ourselves to uniting and simplifying the
apparatus and the departments. Introduce bonuses for
simplifying the apparatus and for rapid expansion of turnover.

1) People’s Commissariat for Finance

2) Central Statistical Board

3) State Planning Commission

4) Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn

Secret

Comrade Osinsky:

I think the editor of Selskokhozyaistvennaya Zhizn should
be removed, and Vainstein and Oganovsky placed under
special surveillance. Such is my conclusion after reading
Selskokhozyaistvennaya Zhizn No. 34 (75). Show this letter
in strict secrecy to Comrades Yakovenko and Teodorovich
(the latter is especially to blame) and return to me with
the addition of information about the editor, A. N.
Morosanov (?), and the other two in greater detail. Their record,
etc., in more detail. They are probably Right-wing S.R.s
to whom you three “have fallen” victim.

What measures are you three taking to prevent a
repetition of this?

17.V.1922
People’s Commissar for Education

I have received some information showing that the high
price of books, considering our “enthusiasms” and the
exaggerations of NEP, is depriving the people of useful
books.

I should think it is necessary to lay down some kind
of rule or pass a law on roughly these lines: specified
amounts should be apportioned from local taxes to be paid
to a centre for a fund to cover the cost of several thousand
books (say, Skvortsov, Electrification, etc.) for
distribution to all uyezd libraries.

Please discuss this and let me know your
opinion.[3]

Comrade Rykov:

If the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade and its
men are “confusing” everything(xxx), we should make sure

    

not to do likewise. And if we write “reportedly”(x) and
postpone things “until the question is cleared up”(xx), it
looks as though we are encouraging the confusion. Why
not put an end to the confusion by having Smolyaninov (or
someone else, but someone definite, to enable you too to
make a personal check right away) get on the direct line to
find out immediately and without any “reportedly”. Who
is responsible at the Ukrainian People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade? What has he been doing? Has he sent, is
sending or will send one or two ships? When? to whom?
how many?

We seem to have the P.C.F.T. in a terrible state of chaos,
yet we are encouraging the chaos instead of carrying on any
real fight against it. Is that how you used to work under
the “Chuso”? And is it possible to overcome the chaos
unless the methods of the old “Chuso” are
used?[1]

18/V. Lenin
TELEPHONE MESSAGE TO V. I. LENIN

Vladimir Ilyich:

We discussed at the C.L.D. the question concerning the dispatch
of the two ships to Italy. We established that the Ukrainian
Commissariat for Foreign Trade has a special organisation for the sale and export
of coal to Italy which has
reportedly x) sent out one ship. That is why

we confined ourselves to a decision on selecting the best brands of coal
for the needs of export to Italy—for the purpose of winning the
Italian market. As for the question of the two ships itself—we have
postponed it until the question of how much coal has already been
sent to Italy is
cleared up. xx)

Please note that our representatives at Genoa have been
confusing xxx) us
all the time, making demands which they cancel within
a few days. I shall send a telegram tomorrow asking them to bring
up with Moscow only motivated and considered questions and
proposals, as it is quite impossible to do one thing at the request of
Litvinov and Chicherin only to abandon it on Krasin’s proposal. Krasin’s
telegram shows that he himself is out of touch and does not know
that the coal is already on the way and has been partially sold. The
telegram on which you have made an inscription does not even say
    

to which of the Italian ports the coal is to go, whore the buyer is to
he found, and who is to be responsible for the sale of coal in Italy.

In sending on to you this letter of Comrade

Comrade Dzerzhinsky:

On the question of deporting the writers and professors
helping the counter-revolution.

This needs more thorough preparation. Without it we
shall make mistakes. Please discuss these measures of
preparation.

Gall a conference of Messing, Mantsev and some other
persons in Moscow.

Put the duty on the Politbureau members to devote 2–3 
hours a week to looking through a number of periodicals
and books, verifying execution, demanding reviews in
writing, and securing the dispatch to Moscow of all
non-communist publications without delay.

Add to this the reviews by a number of Communist
writers (Steklov, Olminsky, Skvortsov, Bukharin, etc.).

Collect systematic information about the political
record, work and literary activity of the professors and
writers.

Assign all this to an intelligent, educated and scrupulous
man at the G.P.U.

My opinion on the two Petrograd publications:

Novaya Rossiya
No. 2.[2] Closed down by the Petrograd
comrades.

Perhaps it has been closed down too early? Circulate
it to the Politbureau members and discuss more thoroughly.
What is its editor Lezhnev? Is he from Dyen? Could
information about him be collected? Of course, not all the
people working on the magazine are candidates for
deportation.[3]

The Petrograd magazine Ekonomist, published by the
XIth Department of the Russian Technical Society, is
another
matter.[4] I think this is clearly a whiteguard centre.
Its No. 3 (only No. 3!!! this nota bene!) carries a list of
its members on the cover. These, I think, are almost all
the most legitimate candidates for deportation.

These are all patent counter-revolutionaries, accomplices
of the Entente, an organisation of its servitors and spies
and corrupters of the student youth. We should make

    

arrangements to have these “military spies” caught and once
caught constantly and systematically and deported.

Please show this confidentially, without making any
copies, to the Politbureau members, returning it to you
and to me, and inform me of their opinion and your
conclusion.

19/V. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with preparations for deporting
anti-Soviet-minded intellectuals.





[2]
Novaya Rossiya (New Russia)—a socio-literary and scientific
monthly inclining to the Smena Vekh trend (see Note 415);
published from 1922 to 1926 under the editorship of I. G. Lezhnev;
the first two issues appeared in Petrograd in March and June
1922. Subsequently, from August 1922, it was published in
Moscow under the title Rossiya. See next note.





[3]
Having examined on May 26, 1922, on Lenin’s proposal, the
question of the journal Novaya Rossiya, the Politbureau of the
R.C.P.(B.) C.C. instructed the Central Press Board “as the
highest instance to permit the further publication of the journal
Novaya Rossiya, rescinding the decision of the Petrograd
Executive Committee on its closure” (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Dyen (Day)—bourgeois literary daily; published in St. 
Petersburg from 1912. Among those participating in its publication
were Menshevik-liquidators, who secured full control after the
bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917. It was closed
clown by the Revolutionary Military Committee of the
Petrograd Soviet on October 26 (November 8), 1917.





[4]
Ekonomist—a journal of the industrial and economic department
of the Russian Technical Society, whose membership consisted
of bourgeois technical intellectuals hostile to the Soviet power
and former owners of enterprises. It was published in Petrograd
from December 1921. In his article “On the Significance of
Militant Materialism”, Lenin called the journal “an organ of
modern feudalists” (see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 227–36).
In June 1922, the journal was closed down.

Comrade Dzerzhinsky:

I have a serious apprehension: there seems to be some
“excess” in the expenses on my garage, which I believe
is under particular G.P.U. supervision. Isn’t it time that
this establishment is “compressed” and the expenditures
on it reduced? Everyone is reducing all expenditures.

Please show this to my “deputies” Rykov and Tsyurupa,
and assign a reliable, intelligent, knowledgeable man to
check up on whether the expenses under this head can be
reduced and compressed, and reduced to the
utmost.[1]

19/V. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On the note is the following conclusion written by F. E.
Dzerzhinsky: “I consider reduction hero inadmissible. The pool has
6 cars and only 12 men. Wage rates normal. Car maintenance—
good. No idle running of cars.” The conclusion was also signed
By A. D. Tsyurupa and A. I. Rykov.

Comrade Stalin:

I am sending on to you a letter from Comrade Anikst,
who attacked me yesterday (18/V). He is offended,
embittered, alarmed. He is nervous, he is sick. I advised him to
complete his treatment and to keep a grip on his nerves.
He seems to be a good worker. His treatment should be

    

completed in Germany or in Riga. (Nothing will come out
in
Russia.)”[1]

19/V. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on the reverse side of a letter from A. M. Anikst, Deputy
People’s Commissar for Labour, of May 18, 1922, asking Lenin,

   

“in conformity”  with their talk, to take steps to have the
question of his nominal removal from the Collegium of the P.C.L.,
in view of his recruitment for local work, left open pending his
return after receiving medical treatment. He also asked that
his dispatch for medical treatment should be expedited.

On May 27, 1922, the Secretariat of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee confirmed the foregoing decision to send Anikst and
his wife for medical treatment to the Caucasus for a period of
six weeks.

Comrade Stalin:

Please pass on for decision by the C.C. Secretariat (or
the Orgbureau; I do not know whose competence this is)
the following petition of mine:

to send the surgeon, V. N. Rozanov, physician of the
Soldatenkovskaya Hospital, for leave in Riga in July,
together with his son.

This is the request I had from V. N. Rozanov, who has
not charged me any fees now, as he had not done in 1918,
although he has been to see me repeatedly. Comrade
Semashko says that he is the best surgeon, but has little
rest.

This is why I request; that he should be granted this
holiday, and ask that a secretary should be assigned to
inform me of the decision of the Orgbureau or the  C.C.
Secretariat.[1]

21/IV.1922. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On May 23, 1922, the Secretariat of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee decided to meet Lenin’s request to send surgeon V. N.
Rozanov and his son for a holiday in Riga. Rozanov later recalled
this in his reminiscences of Lenin (see Vospominaniya o V. I.
Lenine, Part 2, Moscow, 1957, pp. 406–07).

Secret. Personal
To All People’s Commissars
(to the deputies of those
who are absent)

Also to all separate establishments: Central Statistical
Board, State Planning Commission, Concessions Committee,
People’s Commissariat for Internal Trade under the C.L.D.,

    

Centrosoyuz, etc., All-Russia Central T.U.C., Comintern,
Profintern, etc.

As I am going on holiday for several months, it is my
earnest request that you should keep me informed of the
most important matters and the fulfilment of the most
important decisions, plans, campaigns, etc., as follows:

—send me once or twice a month the briefest (not more
than 2 or 3 pages) communications on the subject, and
give instructions to send me the most important of the
current publications by the People’s Commissariat and
also the texts of the most important published decrees and
drafts. If the People’s Commissar should find it
inconvenient to do this work himself, please inform me who
specifically (deputy, member of collegium, business manager
or secretary, etc.) is to have this duty, instructing that
person to maintain regular contacts with my secretary
(Fotieva, Lepeshinskaya). Through these same secretaries it
is always possible to send inquiries by telegraph or by
mail, with the current and urgent inquiries addressed not
otherwise than to my deputy (Rykov or Tsyurupa) and
only copies sent to me.

21/V. Lenin

_ _ _ _
_ _ _ _

The secretaries will have the duty to watch accurately
that this is done, informing me of the incoming
publications, not sending in the whole lot, but only the most
important ones (the rest—only a list).

Of the Russian newspapers supply regularly Pravda,
Izvestia and Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn.

Maintain regular contacts with the Communist
International and the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs,
asking them to supply the most important foreign
publications, especially pamphlets on current questions.

Of the Russian publications abroad send in
Nakanune,[1]
Sotsial-Demokrat (Menshevik), Zarya (Menshevik),
Sovremenniye Zapiski (S.R.), Russkaya
Mysl[2] and a list of
the other publications, pamphlets and books.
 

Notes

Nakanune (On the Eve)—a newspaper published in Berlin with    

the participation of the Smena Vekh group (see Note 415).

Prague in 1922 under the editorship of P. B. Struve.

   Comrade Stalin

I think this should be shown in strict secrecy (without
making any copies) to Dzerzhinsky and all the members
of the Politbureau, and a directive issued: “Dzerzhinsky
(G.P.U.) is authorised to work out, with Semashko’s
assistance, a plan of measures and report to the Politbureau
within a period of ———
(2 weeks?).”[1]

22/V. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written under the text of a note from N. A. Semashko, People’s
Commissar for Public Health, to members of the Politbureau
of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. about =

“important and dangerous (Lenin’s
emphasis.—Ed.) trends” in the medical world, which had come
to the surface at the Second All-Russia Congress of Medical
Sections under the C.C. of the Medical and Sanitary Workers’ Union
(held in Moscow from May 10 to 14, 1922). Reporting the
anti-Soviet speeches by some “top” doctors, who were Mensheviks
and S.R.s, Semashko said it was necessary to take resolute
measures against them.

On May 24, 1922, the Politbureau adopted Lenin’s proposal
instructing Dzerzhinsky and Semashko “to work out a plan of
measures and to report to the Politbureau within a week”
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of
the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

Urgent

Secret
To Comrade Stalin with a request to circulate
   all Politbureau members
(being sure to include Comrade Zinoviev)

On the strength of this information from Comrade
Reinstein, I am giving both Armand Hammer and B. Mishell
a special recommendation on my own behalf and request
all C.C. members to give these persons and their enterprise
particular
support.[1] This is a small path leading to the
American “business” world, and this path should be made
use of in every way. If there are any objections, please
telephone them to my secretary (Fotieva or Lepeshinskaya),
to enable me to clear up the matter (and take a final
decision through the Politbureau) before I leave, that is,
within the next few
days.[2]

24/V. Lenin
 

P.S. 27/V. I have held this back pending a reply from
Comrade Zinoviev. The reply came in on 26/V.

Lenin

A reference to B. I. Reinstein’s report giving detailed
information about Dr. J. Hammer and his son Armand Hammer,

Lenin’s proposal was adopted by the Politbureau on June 2,
1922.

Lydia Alexandrovna:

You can congratulate me on my recovery. The proof is
my handwriting, which is beginning to look human again.
Start preparing books for me (and sending me lists) of
1) science, 2) fiction, 3) politics (the latter last of all,
because it is not yet allowed).

Will you complain to Rykov (Tsyurupa has left, hasn’t
he?) about all the secretaries: they are misbehaving,
suffering from malaria, etc. Let him arrange for their rest
in Riga, in Finland, near Moscow, etc. I think Rykov
should issue a reprimand to Smolyaninov and yourself for
failing to take good care of the secretaries.

Regards,

Lenin

21/VIII.

Comrade Vladimirov:

As regards the apparatus, you are being unjustly
aggrieved. I quite agree with you, and am informing both
Stalin and Rykov about it.—— As regards catching out
“NEPmen” I advise that we give very careful thought
(perhaps, assign to this in a highly secret manner
Rozengolts and another one or two comrades) about what
we should do shortly: either introduce an income tax or a
compulsory loan? or: which earlier?

Local finances have already yielded considerable data.
They should be systematically collected and processed,
winkling out the names and then deciding the matter
raised.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Comrade Rykov:

I am sending you a cutting from Izvestia (of 25.VIII,
I
believe).[1] I advise that you issue instructions to have
this given particular attention. Check up (through the
business manager or a secretary).
 

If it is true, give every support.

Has Rutgers achieved anything? I doubt it.

If anything has been achieved here, we should
award the Order of the Banner of Labour;— send a letter
to America (on your behalf or mine);— make the State
Bank work out easier loans for such enterprises; and
make the People’s Commissariat for Finance or the
People’s Commissariat for Agriculture urgently work out
easier terms for recruiting more tractors (in the autumn;
now, to manage in time).

This appears to be an efficient example; business-like
assistance; while we over here have no end of red tape!

Instruct secretary or business manager to write me  a
reply.[2]

Yours,

Lenin

N.B. Carry out Getier’s orders strictly!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On August 25, 1922, Izvestia VTsIK carried an article entitled
“Real Aid from ‘Friends of Soviet Russia’”, describing the work

   

of the tractor team organised by members of the American
Society of Friends of Soviet Russia, at the Toikino State Farm,
Okhan Uyezd, Perm Gubernia (see Collected Works, Fifth
(Russian) Edition, Vol. 54, Document 470). It was led by the
American Communist Harold Ware. On a newspaper cutting, Lenin
underlined the caption and wrote “NB” in the left margin.





[2]

V. A. Smolyaninov informed Lenin that he had sent a telegram
to the Chairman of the Perm Gubernia Executive Committee
asking him to acquaint himself with the work of the American
tractor team, give his opinion about it, and help the team.
Smolyaninov wrote that the talks on modifying the agreement with
the Rutgers group were to be held when Rutgers returned from
Kuzbas.

Having received the material from Perm, Lenin sent letters
to the Society of Friend? of Soviet Russia (in the United Stales),
the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, to the Chairman

Urquhart should be given a concession only provided
we get a big loan.

All members of the Politbureau should acquaint
themselves with the report of the Mikhailov Commission, which
had gone out for an on-the-spot inspection of the plants
to be handed over under concession to Urquhart, and which
expressed a negative opinion.
 

Our enemies hope to see the fixed capital in our
transport and industry completely ruined. It is necessary to
find the resources to rehabilitate this capital by imposing
taxes on all articles of consumption, raising them to the
maximum on such articles as sugar and beer.

Bear in mind an internal compulsory loan and an
income tax.
 

Notes

At the top of the document Dzerzhinsky wrote: “V. I.’s

 opinion.”—Ed.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

I thank you for your
information.[1] Will you be so kind
as to find out the exact address of Comrade Zhidelev in
the Crimea. I want to send him a letter (it would be more
reliable to send it along with someone; please find out
when there is an express train for the Crimea).

With communist greetings,


Lenin

I forgot another assignment (1) send me I. 
Besprozvanny’s pamphlets: (a) Planning Bureau at a Small Industrial
Enterprise Organised on the Taylor System,
Nizhni-Novgorod, 1915.

and (b) also his: Modern Organisation of American Plants,
Moscow, 1919.

Also find out at the S.E.C. archives who gave permission
or submitted for publication this latter pamphlet, the
1919 one. It is the S.E.C. that has published
it.[2]

7/IX.1922.

Comrade Bukharin:

I have read (in Sotsialistichesky Vestnik) Gorky’s vile
letter.[2] At first I thought of attacking him in the press
(over the S.R.s), but then decided that this would he too
much. Let us consult about this. Perhaps you see him
now and then and talk with him? Please, write me your
opinion. I have seen few newspapers (almost no foreign
ones). This means that I have scant knowledge of the
“situation”. Write me your opinion in the greatest possible
detail.

Best regards from all of us to your wife and yourself.

Yours,

Lenin

P.S. I am almost well.

P.S. I am writing to Krestinsky to get me the original
of Gorky’s letter published in Sotsialistichesky Vestnik of
20/VII.1922.[1]


If he forgets, will you send it along.

[2]
A reference to Maxim Gorky’s letter to Anatole France on July 3,
1922, over the trial of the Socialist-Revolutionaries on charges
of counter-revolutionary activity. Gorky missed the essence of
the case, and wrote that the trial was a preparation for “the
murder of people who had sincerely served the cause of the Russian
people’s emancipation”, and asked France to write to the Soviet
Government to tell them that it was “intolerable to allow the
crime”. Perhaps, “your weighty word will save the valuable
lives of socialists”. He also sent France a copy of his letter on
this question to Deputy Chairman of the C.P.C., A. I. Rykov,

   

warning that the passage of death sentences on the accused
would result “in a moral blockade of Russia by socialist Europe”.

Dear Comrade Tomsky:

I shall fulfil your request with great
pleasure.[2] Please
write me whether or not there are any special subjects
that you want me to deal with in my letter. I have fallen
very far behind, and don’t know whether it is all right
to confine myself to a general and plain message of

    

greetings, or whether I should discuss more or less
circumstantially any special
subject.[1]

12/IX.

Comrade Stalin:

Having read Krasin’s agreement with Urquhart, I
express my objection to its approval. While promising
earnings for us within two or three years, Urquhart is taking
our money just now. This is absolutely inadmissible.
Mikhailov, chairman of the commission, who had made a
special on-the-spot study of the Urquhart concession, has
proved that it is not we but the foreigners who are guilty
of the destruction. And after this it is we who have to pay! I
We shall allegedly obtain relief within Xyears, but we
ourselves have to start paying right away!

I propose that this concession be rejected.

This is bondage and plunder.

I remind you of the conclusion of the Mikhailov
commission. It was against the concession.

Not a single serious argument has been added. It should
be rejected.

I ask you to communicate this to the Politbureau
members.

With communist greetings,


V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

P.S. It is a ruse to say that this concession will not be
a precedent.
 

It is bound to be and is sure to be a precedent. That is
how it is sure actually to shape out regardless of all the
talk and assurances.

And in general, absolutely no account has been taken
of everything uncovered by the Mikhailov commission.
There are a number of arguments against such a concession.

Lenin

Comrade Stalin:

Please show Comrade Tomsky this draft letter (and if
necessary, also to Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov, etc.) and
please return to me, retyped, not later than tomorrow.

I shall send it in to the congress by the 16th, or

necessary.[1]

A reference to a draft letter to the Fifth All-Russia Congress of
Trade Unions, with the initials of members of the C.C.
Politbureau and this note by M. P. Tomsky: “It would be good to
bring out the workers in greater relief, and a couple of words about
large-scale industry being the basis of socialism.” Apparently
in connection with this remark, Lenin added to the third sentence
this insertion: “and it is precisely that part of industry known
as heavy industry which is the main basis of socialism” (present
edition, Vol. 33, pp. 370–71).

Lenin’s letter was read out at the first sitting of the congress
on September 17, 1922.

Comrade Rykov:

I see from the papers that the situation over Donbas
and Baku is desperate. What do you think? Shall we risk
taking a few millions from the gold stock? Will not things
be made worse if we miss this business and leave it
without assistance? Perhaps you will ask Smilga or his

    

deputy to prepare a short, report (no more than 5-10 lines)
to help me get a clear view of the
situation?[1]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes

On September 27, 1922, A. I. Rykov informed Lenin that the          

C.L.D. had decided to issue 14,000,000 million rubles for the       

needs of the main fuel areas (Baku, Grozny and Donbas), that

doubled, and that other measures would also be taken,

Comrade Vladimirov

Dear Comrade:
Will you be so kind as to inform me 

1) how much gold we have left? (a) total, (b) including
that free from any obligations?

2) how many other valuables (very briefly, in the most
general terms);

3) the size of the deficit now (the last quarter or month);

4) have you thought about the income tax and the
compulsory loan? Briefly: what are your conclusions (only the
final
ones).[1]

With communist greetings,


Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In reply to this inquiry, M. K. Vladimirov, Deputy People’s       

Commissar for Finance, sent Lenin reports on the gold stock        

and the tax revenue from the beginning of 1922 to September 17.    

He gave the budget deficit for the quarter July to September,      

and added that the deficit for September would be especially       

large because of the expenditure on the People’s Commissariat      

for Railways and industry, and would reach 250,000,000 million     

only in emission; the probable deficit for the quarter October     

to December was being estimated. Vladimirov also reported the      

measures being taken to cut back expenditures.

Comrade Zinoviev:

About the rapporteur I agree conditionally:
1) Trotsky
must also be there as a substitute (and for his own report
as well);
2) I should be allowed to back out, but only if
my health or my work prevents
me.[1]

Concerning Urquhart, I withdraw my hesitations. There
are already some American proposals. Baku is much
better and more important. There is a decision by a C.C.

    

commission (Smilga + Andreyev + Krasin) which has been
directly violated by Krasin. There are all the other minuses
(99 years; the immensity of the dimensions,
etc.).[2]

P.S. Let the Politbureau members read this.

Yours,

Lenin

18/IX.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Lenin’s speech at the forthcoming Fourth
Congress of the Communist International.

At the morning sitting on November 13, 1922, Lenin gave
a report “Five Years of the Russian Revolution and the
Prospects of the World Revolution” (see present edition, Vol. 33,
pp. 418–32).





[2]
The talks with Leslie Urquhart, which he broke off in October
1921, were resumed in 1922. A preliminary agreement was
signed by L. B. Krasin on September 9, 1922 (for the terms see
this volume, Document 750). Having acquainted himself with
the agreement, Lenin found it to be patently disadvantageous
for the Soviet state, and in a letter to Politbureau members on
September 12 came out against its approval (see this volume,

   

Document 754). Lenin wrote about this in the note to Zinoviev
here published.

The commission mentioned by Lenin was set up by the
Politbureau on August 24, 1922, to specify and put the finishing
touches to the draft agreement with Urquhart.

By “American proposals” Lenin apparently means the talks
between Krasin and the International Barnsdoll Corporation,
with which two agreements were signed on September 20, 1022:
one for the exploitation of the Balakhany oil wells in Baku for
15 1/2 years, and the other for the sinking of new wells. See also
this volume, Documents 767 and 784, and Collected Works, Fifth
(Russian) Edition, Vol. 54, Documents 483 and 485.

Comrade Smolyaninov:

I am coming on 1 or 2.X. Will be in the chair on
Tuesday,
3.X.[1] Meeting 5–9 hours. With a 1/4–hour break.

Warn smokers. No smoking. Strictly. Tea and smoking
during the break (in the adjoining room).
 

Is Tsyurupa here? When he returns, arrange a meeting
here of all three deputies.

If he does not arrive, have a 2–3 hour meeting on
Monday: either from 11 to 2, or from 5 to 7.

You should arrange all this properly.

On Tuesday morning have the material prepared for me
on the whole of the agenda.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

Find out about a congress on the questions of
normalisation. When? Try to attend. I am extremely interested.
Have a man from the State Planning Commission attend
who takes a very great
interest.[2]

A reference to the first conference in Russia to normalise the
organs of administration, which was held in Moscow from
September 21 to 23, 1922. In its resolution, the conference noted
the unsatisfactory nature of the existing administrative
techniques and organisation (dispatch of business, administration,
accounting, storage facilities, etc.) and supported the
experimental methods of studying administrative questions, and also
recognised the need “gradually to develop a network of
scientifically based experimental stations and normalisation bureaus
under the People’s Commissariats and major economic
establishments closely connected with the central research organisations
on the questions of administration and labour”.

Comrade Glyasser:

I am writing to Smolyaninov.

Let him show it to you and to all the secretaries.

I shall come on 2/X (or 1.X). Please have everything
ready by
Tuesday.[1]


I have received the C.C. minutes. They are almost in
order (some enclosures are missing). But this is quite
enough for the time being. It will be well to have extracts
from the C.P.C. and C.L.D. minutes (newspaper cuttings)
arranged conveniently for looking through.

With communist greetings,

25/IX.

Comrade Pyatakov:

Here is a rough record of our conversation of yesterday.

1) Comrade Pyatakov is to organise (and tighten up in
a military fashion) the State Planning Commission
apparatus itself (or the apparatus of the State Planning
Commission itself); mainly through an executive business
manager. He himself should give this matter some 30
minutes a day as a maximum.

2) Comrade Pyatakov’s main task is:
a) verification of
the state-wide plan, above all the economic plan, chiefly
from the standpoint of the apparatus as a whole;
b)
reduction of the apparatus, including our trusts;
c) verification
of the proportion between the various sections of the state
apparatus;
d) work to reduce the cost of the state
apparatus on the lines of an American trust: eliminate all
unproductive expenditures.

3) Comrade Pyatakov is to be released from the State

    

Planning Commission’s current work to a maximum
(roughly, an hour a day).

Think this over, show Krzhizhanovsky and reply to
me.[1]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On October 2, 1922, G. L. Pyatakov informed C.P.C. secretary        

Maria Glyasser that he had not replied to Lenin’s letter because    

G. M. Krzhizhanovsky had not yet returned to Moscow.

The register of Lenin’s outgoing documents has the following        

entry under the “Execution” head: “Settled by a personal talk    

between Vladimir Ilyich and Pyatakov.”

25/IX.

Comrade Rykov:

I think it is absolutely necessary to carry out a one-day
census of all officials and employees of the city of Moscow.
We had one, but too long ago.

To do this at the minimum expense (only on paper,
and even this can be obtained partly from the general
stock of the Central Statistical Board), put an obligation
on all those who are on the payroll of the Soviet
government and the trusts to submit information on personal

    

cards themselves (in accordance with a short programme
which the Central Statistical Board must work out within
a week, together with the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection,
the State Planning Commission, etc.). No one is to be
paid any salary until this is properly done.

Then we shall get this quickly (fines for delays and
unsatisfactory performance).

Our apparatus is such an abomination that it has to be
radically repaired. This cannot be done without a census.
And the Central Statistical Board deserves being taken to
task for its academism: there they are sitting and writing
their “tomes”, giving not a thought to the vital problems.

Reply or pass the reply on to Comrade Smolyaninov.

Yours,

Lenin

Mobilisation should he applied, if necessary, but
under a special law. All the employees of the Central
Statistical Board should be mobilised and a certain percentage
of the others as
well.[1]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On September 29, 1922, the C.L.D. approved the programme for           

a one-day census of Soviet government employees, employees    

of syndicates, trusts and other state establishments and trade         

unions in Moscow, which had been worked out at a conference            

of representatives of the People’s Commissariat for Workers’           

and Peasants’ Inspection, the Central Statistical Board and the        

State Planning Commission. On October 3, the C.P.C., having            

approved the programme and the census procedure, assigned its          

implementation to the Central Statistical Board of the R.S.F.S.R.      

H was held in mid-October 1922. The results were used by Lenin         

in his speech at the Fourth Session of the Ninth All-Russia C.E.C.     

on October 31, 1922 (see present edition, Vol. 33, p. 394). Lenin      

also mentions the census in his “Outline of Speech at the Tenth       

All-Russia Congress of Soviets” (see present edition, Vol. 36,        

pp. 588–89).

Comrade Krasin:

You have working for you a man called Yermakov (head
of the transport-materials department?) with the rights of
member of the Collegium. I saw him two or three times
during the Civil War years, carrying out the most difficult,
responsible and dangerous assignments. He is no ordinary
man. It turns out that he is most gravely ill (bleeding from
the throat). He has tried to receive treatment, but has
never completed the full course, because the local “boys”
have always diverted him to local work. He has a big
family; his salary is 200 million—next to nothing.

This won’t do. It is our duty to provide treatment for
such men and see that it is completed. He should be sent
to Germany for a few months, and his family should be
helped. (Write me a couple of words
confidentially.)[1]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
That same day, October 4, 1922, L. B. Krasin replied to Lenin
(Fiat he had no objections to sending V. S. Yermakov abroad,
to give him a chance to go to Italy and receive medical
treatment while making a study of the operation of ports, unloading
mechanisms, etc. On October 16, Lenin instructed his secretary
to check up whether Yermakov had received the money, and was
informed by him that all the necessary arrangements had been
made.

P.S. What’s new at the

Written on October 6, 1922

First published in 1965 in Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Ed., Vol. 54

Printed from the original


 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On October 5, the Plenum of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee
and on October 6, the C.P.C. adopted decisions rejecting the
preliminary agreement with Leslie Urquhart (see Izvestia VTsIK
No. 226, October 7, 1922).

However, Lenin, the Party C.C. and the Soviet Government
did not rule out the possibility of returning to the question of
granting Urquhart a concession. In this connection Lenin believed
it to be necessary once again to verify most thoroughly all
the terms of the concession. In particular, he proposed a
reduction in area of the concession and the amounts Urquhart was to
receive (see this volume, Document 768, and also present
edition, Vol. 42, p. 424).





[2]
On October 9, 1922, Lenin saw V. Y. Chubar, head of the State
Coal Industry of Donbas.

Lenin attached great importance to the rehabilitation of the
Donets Coal Basin, showed a constant interest in its work and
did everything to help restore and develop it. On October 6, 1922,
V. A. Smolyaninov sent Chubar a letter containing Lenin’s request
to reply briefly to questions about the supply of Donbas. “Let us
know the result of your talks. How much do you want and how
much are they giving you?”

To the letter is attached a note from Smolyaninov addressed

   

to Lenin. It says: “Vladimir Ilyich, I have sent off the letter to
Chubar. Perhaps I should send copies to Kamenev and Rykov?
6/X.” Below that Lenin wrote: “You should” (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee).





[3]
The Plenum of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee was
held from October 5 to 7, 1922. Lenin attended the October 5
sitting, but not the others because of illness. 

The register of Lenin’s outgoing documents, under the head
“Execution”, has a secretarial note saying that L. B. Kamenev’s
reply was received on October 7 and “handed to Vladimir Ilyich”
(the reply has not been found).

Comrade Pyatakov:

Yesterday you spoke out, like myself, against the
Urquhart concession. That is why I think you are able and
will agree to check once again the matter of this concession
(especially since our decision of yesterday in essence puts
off the question once again).
 

It is my opinion that the check-up should deal mainly
with the question of monopoly; that is the central point
of the matter. Then there is the question of the financial
benefits from the concession.

1) A map of the concession should be obtained at the
Mining Council—I. K. Mikhailov (chairman of the
commission which went to the place) says that he gave them the
map.

2) There is need to compile a table: a list of the main,
products; percentage of their production at our other plants
(copper, zinc, and other products); where else they are
produced, whether very far from the centre or nearer, etc.

3) Conclusion: in what branch, for what product
Urquhart is to get a monopoly, its significance.

4) The chief of all the questions—Ekibastuz and its
importance for the Urals.

I was very surprised at Bogdanov’s slip: “Kuzbas is
nearer” (it is much farther), while Comrade
Krzhizhanovsky said that I was adhering to Mendeleyev’s obsolete and
rejected views. What is there to argue about when
Ekibastuz has a branch-line running to the Irtysh, and provides
much shorter and cheaper water transport to the Urals?
What is the essence here?

If Kuzbas is much more expensive and distant (no
water transport), we have no right to let Urquhart have the
whole of Ekibastuz; he is welcome to take one-half.

  

Please show this letter only to Krzhizhanovsky; do not
assign this check-up to anyone else; do it yourself (of
course, any official will let you have all the statistical
figures about the volume and place of extraction of zinc,
copper, etc., without knowing what they are for); write me
whether you undertake to do this, and how soon you expect
to finish it.

With communist greetings,


Lenin

16/X.1922

Comrade Sergo:

Both Stalin and Sokolnikov have turned out to be
against appropriations for an electric-power station near
Tiflis.
 

Compromise: Tumanov’s trip.

Pay particular attention to this (it also involves the
question of tea, etc.).

Collect all the material (for the business manager).

Send me both the material and a short summary (for
me personally). This will be a hard
fight.[1]

Yours,

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
During the discussion of appropriations for the construction of
the Zemo-Avchal Hydropower Station near Tiflis, A. S. Svanidze,
agent for the People’s Commissariat for Finance of the
R.S.F.S.R. and the People’s Commissariat for Finance of the
Transcaucasian Federation, declared that the Tiflis Soviet, had
enough resources to build the station without Moscow aid. This
standpoint was upheld by Stalin and Sokolnikov. In view of the
differences on this question, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
C.C. on October 12, 1922, instructed N. G. Tumanov, senior
controller of the People’s Commissariat for Finance, to find out
at the Georgian C.P.C. whether local resources would suffice,
how much was necessary and how far a loan could be covered by
Georgian tea.

This question was finally settled later. On March 1, 1923, the
Politbureau, taking into account the protest of the Georgian
C.P.C., the Tiflis Soviet and the power-station construction
committee, and also G. K. Orjonikidze’s proposal, decided to let
the Tiflis City Executive Committee have a 750,000 gold-ruble
loan to cover the needs of the power station (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

17.X.1922
Comrades Kamenev and Gorbunov

I support Comrade Shotman’s application for the
construction of a paper mill in Karelia and the working of
mica. If there are no special obstacles, please speed up
the
matter.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, C.P.C.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written after a talk with A. V. Shotman, representative of the
Karelian Labour Commune, about economic development in
Karelia.

The application from the Karelian Labour Commune for a loan
to build a pulp mill and work mica deposits was examined by
the Narrow C.P.C. on November 15, 1922. It decided the
longterm loan was necessary and instructed the People’s
Commissariat for Finance and the State Planning Commission, with

   

A. V. Shotman’s participation, to determine the exact amount
and the terms of repayment.

Through Shotman Lenin conveyed his comradely gratitude to
the Congress of Soviets of the Karelian Commune and the Party
conference for their message of greetings, and sent his best
wishes to the Karelian working people.

Comrade STALIN for the POLITBUREAU
Copy to Comrade KAMENEV

I have given a careful reading to the agreement with
Otto Wolff. I find that Comrade Kamenev’s objections are

    

based entirely on a misunderstanding, and I believe the
question should be brought up for decision by the
Politbureau not later than tomorrow, because the difference
between Kamenev and myself calls for an authoritative
and final decision.

Kamenev writes in his note that “we are under an
obligation to Wolff to buy his goods”. This is a complete
misunderstanding. When reading the agreement, I saw in
several clauses that we have the right to check the list of
goods given us by Wolff. We do not undertake the slightest
obligation to buy Wolff’s goods. If Wolff fails to draw
up a list of goods which we agree to buy, then the
agreement extends only to that part of Wolff’s goods which we
have agreed to buy. I clarified this matter in detail today
both with Lezhava and Frumkin, and both have confirmed
that not the slightest obligation in any sense falls on us
to buy Wolff’s goods.

A similar misunderstanding on Comrade Kamenev’s part
explains his allegation that Lezhava has “enhanced” his
doubt. Actually there is quite a different explanation to
Stomonyakov’s proposal, which is formulated on page 2
of Protocol No. 62, and which was unanimously accepted
by all our economic executives. The proposal is that, in
the interests of our reviving industry, Wolff should develop
to the utmost the delivery to us of machine-tools and
other implements necessary, for example, for the electric
trust. Wolff may accept this because such an order will
also give him earnings, and it happens that the German
metal industry is in need of orders in general. We are
absolutely in need of machine-tools and machinery for the
electric trust, let us say, because this industry of ours is
beginning to revive, and it is of extreme importance for us
to develop this industry here, by finally reinforcing it with
German means of production.

Consequently, the amendment tabled by Lezhava flows
from the correctly understood economic interests of
Russia, which now needs protectionism, especially for her
whole light industry, because then it will be easier for us
to rehabilitate this industry, thereby ensuring the interests
of our proletariat. Lezhava’s amendment has nothing in
common with free trade of any sort or even with the

    

opening of frontiers, assuming the retention of customs tariffs.
At the end of his note, Comrade Kamenev writes:

“The result: for a deferment of our payments to Wolff
for a year, for unknown goods, we are now giving him a
monopoly right to purchase and export raw materials. That
is cheap.”

This is total misunderstanding. It is impossible to
imagine a more advantageous agreement than the one we are
concluding with Wolff. We pay him 10 per cent a year,
whereas even Britain now pays 7 per cent, and the German
Government pays 12 per cent. That’s the first thing. The
second is that we are not buying from him any unknown
goods, but only those we have checked by list and
permitted for import. The third fact is that we are giving him a
monopoly right to buy and export for a sharing of the profits
which can have nothing to do with any kind of customs
tariffs. Namely: first, we receive a 10 per cent dividend,
second, we receive a 10 per cent profit, like Wolff, and
third, if the profit is in excess of 40 per cent, we receive
75 per cent of the rest, whereas the consortium receives
only 25 per cent.

I think the agreement with Wolff is a typical agreement
with German capitalist enterprises.

Such an agreement is immensely advantageous to us if
only because we receive a half share of the profits which
might go up to hundreds of per cent. In the process, the
interests of our reviving industry and consequently of our
industrial enterprises are fully protected. There is not a
trace of the devastating consequences which would flow
for us even from a conditional, even from a temporary
opening of the frontiers. That is why I absolutely insist
on approval of the agreement with Wolff, and in view of
the extreme urgency of the matter I request that this
question should be raised in the Politbureau tomorrow, and
enclose herewith the agreement with Wolff and Comrade
Kamenev’s
note.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the agreement between the R.S.F.S.R.
Government, arid a consortium of German firms headed by Otto
Wolff, which was concluded in Berlin on October 9, 1922.

The protocol setting up the company was signed in Berlin on
November 16, 1922. By the spring of 1923, the company had
opened its branches in a number of Soviet cities, among them
Moscow, Petrograd and Rostov-on-Don. The conclusion of the
agreement with the Wolff consortium and its ratification
created a strong impression abroad and produced a favourable
atmosphere for talks with other businessmen, and companies.

However, the consortium subsequently became remiss in its
obligations tinder (lie agreement, and in 1924 withdrew from
the Russo-German Trading Society.





[2]
The agreement with the Otto Wolff consortium was approved
by a C.P.C. decree of October 19, 1922. That same day, Lenin
spoke on the agreement in the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.)
C.C., which decided: “To remove the question, in view of the
agreement reached. To circulate the material on the case to
Politbureau members for their information.”

The communiqué on the C.P.C.’s approval of the agreement
(published in Izvestia VTsIK No. 237, October 20, 1922), which
is at the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism, of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee, contains these
resolutions: “Publish in the papers tomorrow, 19.X.1922. C.P.C.
Chairman, V. Ulyanov (Lenin)” and “Telegraph abroad. Lenin”.

October 20, 1922.

The American tractor team, led by Comrade Harold Ware,
which is working in Okhansk Uyezd, on the territory of
Perm Gubernia, has achieved considerable results, although
it has been working only a short time. Altogether, up to
1,500 dessiatines has been ploughed up, of which almost
1,000 dessiatines has been sown to winter grain crops.

But for the usual drawbacks in our practice, the said
group would have undoubtedly succeeded in achieving even
greater results.

Your report, however, mentions the shortage of gasoline
and lubricating oil, and the shortage of building workers,
but says nothing about what the Gubernia Executive
Committee has done to straighten things out.

It is absolutely intolerable that such a useful
undertaking does not meet with every possible support, especially
on the part of local organisations, which are in a better
position to analyse any obstacles and help to remove
them.

Please give the maximum support to this group, and, in
particular, help implement their proposals for the efficient
use of tractors, supply of gasoline, establishment of a
repair shop, housing construction, etc.

The assistance being extended to us by the American
agricultural groups is most desirable and timely. Our task
in all this is mainly to help them carry out their ideas
with the least possible delay.

Please inform me of the results of your measures through
Comrade Smolyaninov, and also of any specially
important current needs which you are unable to meet yourself.

Tsintsadze and Kavtaradze, C.P.G. C.C., Tiflis
Copy to Orjonikidze, C.C. member and
Orakhelashvili, Secretary of the Transcaucasian Territorial
Committee

I am surprised at the indecent tone of the direct wire
message signed by Tsintsadze and others, which was
handed to me for some reason by Bukharin instead of one of
the C.C. secretaries. I was sure that all the differences had
been ironed out by the C.C. Plenum resolutions with my
indirect participation and with the direct participation of
Mdivani.[2] That is why I resolutely condemn the abuse
against Orjonikidze and insist that your conflict should be
referred in a decent and loyal tone for settlement by the
R.C.P. C.C. Secretariat, which has been handed your
direct wire message.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This telegram was sent out in connection with a conflict between
the Transcaucasian Territorial Committee of the R.C.P.(B.),
headed by G. K. Orjonikidze, and the P. G. Mdivani group in the
Communist Party of Georgia (it included K. M. Tsintsadze
and S. I. Kavtaradze, to whom Lenin’s telegram is addressed).

The Territorial Committee was conducting a fundamentally
correct line, working to bring together the Transcaucasian
Republics into the Transcaucasian Federation, and resolutely
supporting the idea of uniting all the Soviet Republic into a single
state. But Orjonikidze did not always display the necessary
flexibility and caution in pursuing the nationalities policy, allowed
some peremptory actions and haste in putting through some
measures, not, always considering the views and rights of the
Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).
This was used by the Mdivani group, which took a basically wrong

   

approach to the most important aspects of the Party’s
nationalities policy.

Mdivani and his supporters, constituting a majority on the
Georgian Communist Party Central Committee, virtually slowed
clown the economic and political union of the Transcaucasian
Republics, and were intent, in essence, on keeping Georgia
isolated; at first the group opposed the formation of the U.S.S.R.,
but when the October 1922 Plenum of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee adopted its decision to set up the U.S.S.R., they
tried to have Georgia enter the U.S.S.R. directly instead of
through the Transcaucasian Federation, This played into the hands
of the bourgeois nationalists and the Georgian Mensheviks, and
at their congresses, conferences and meetings of Party activists,
the Georgian Communist? justly regarded this as a deviation
towards nationalism.

Tsintsadze and a number of other supporters of Mdivani
addressed to the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee a direct wire
message, in reply to which Lenin sent the telegram here
published.

24/X.1922

A number of newspaper articles have noted the
absolutely extraordinary success scored by some American
agricultural communes and teams who had brought their
tractors along with them. It has been established in a
special check-up that excellent work has been done by the

    

tractor team led by Harold Ware in the Toikino State
Farm, Perm Gubernia. Besides, the Industrial Immigration
Department of the Supreme Economic Council is in
possession of similar information concerning the work of
agricultural communes in Kirsanov Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia,
and in the village of Migayevo, Tiraspol Uyezd, Odessa
Gubernia.

The American Society for Technical Aid to Russia is
now organising nearly 200 artels with 800–1,000 tractors
for dispatch to Russia. If this goes through, we shall have
at least one model farm with American machinery in each
uyezd, which I believe to be of great importance.

With the object of encouraging this undertaking. I have
written letters of thanks to the American Society of
Friends of Soviet Russia and the American Society for
Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, telling them that no type
of aid is as important to us or as timely as that which they
arc extending to our
agriculture.[1]

In these letters I told
them that I was sending a recommendation to the
Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee that
they should declare the Perm and other leading farms
model ones and give them special and extraordinary
assistance, both in respect of building operations, and in the
supply of gasoline, metal, and other material necessary for
the extension of operations and the starting of repair shops.

Please consider this question and grant my
request.[2]

Comrade Sosnovsky

I am sending you a copy of Comrade Osinsky’s letter
from Berlin dated 14/X, in which he writes about the

    

Shatilov
Trust.[2] Please make a study of the work in
selecting improved varieties of oats and insert an item in
Pravda about the importance of this work, in general, and
the work of the Shatilov Trust and the Russian selectionist
Lisitsyn, in particular. You will probably be able to
obtain all the necessary information from Comrade
Teodorovich. Through him, too, you will be able to establish
direct contact with the Shatilov people and Lisitsyn. As a
preliminary, I recommend that you should acquaint
yourself with the book published here in a translation by
Timiryazev entitled The New Earth.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

P.S. Earlier I personally heard Osinsky give a very good
opinion about the new (or old?) selectionist at the
Shatilov Trust. Check this if convenient!

Yours,

Lenin[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The P.S. is in Lenin’s hand.—Ed.
 



[2]
In a letter to Lenin on October 14, 1922, N. Osinsky objected
to the refusal of the interdepartmental conference to include the
Shatilov Oats Trust estimates in the budget of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture on the grounds that it was operating
on a profit-and-loss basis. Osinsky recalled that when the Trust
was set up the need was recognised to subsidise it for three to
five years, and pointed out that refusal of material support for
the Trust would entail the loss of already invested resources.
He asked Lenin “to exert his personal influence in the sense of
fully supplying the Shatilov Trust”. Osinsky also wrote about
the selectionist P. I. Lisitsyn, who was in charge of the whole
project, and who had abandoned purely academic work in order
“to see his oats spread far and wide  ...” (see Istorichesky Arkhiv
No. 1, 1962, pp. 60–61). See this volume, Document 639.

26.X.1922
Comrade Krzhizhanovsky
and Comrade Pyatakov

I am sending you the
enclosed.[1] I have no copy.

This requires an opinion fairly soon (2 or 3 days, I think).


   That is the first thing.

The whole matter is to be solved officially.


   That is the second.

Please hurry.
 

Ivan Ivanovich Radchenko is an old Bolshevik: he must
be helped.

Yours,

Lenin

A reference to a letter from I. I. Radchenko, Chairman of the
Central Board for the Peat Industry, of October 26, 1922,
asking Lenin for help in acquiring abroad an improved
peat-extracting machine made by Strohl & Co. in order to
mechanise peat operations, and for allocating the necessary funds for
its purchase and to cover the cost of sending a commission for

   

testing the machine on the spot. On October 27, 1922, the
Council of Labour and Defence decided to allocate from its reserve
fund 7,000 gold rubles for the purpose.

27.X.1922

Comrade Maximovsky:

You may have heard about yesterday’s C.C.
decision.[2]
In this connection it is perhaps also necessary to review
some of the other sections of the estimates of the People’s
Commissariat for Education in order to co-ordinate the
whole thing, fill in the gaps, etc.

Since you are at the head of the administrative and
financial work of the People’s Commissariat, I ask you to
start at once a review of the estimates of the P.C.E.,
trying to reduce the unnecessary elements in general (part
of the
C.C.I.L. C.S.,[1]

some of the higher schools, many of
the top sections, etc.), to increase appropriations for the
schools and the liquidation of illiteracy. Phone me about
this or write a couple of words.

Yours,

Lenin

Comrade Kamenev:

Comrades Pyatakov and Frumkin
Copies to Comrades Stalin and Kamenev

The telegram received about Comrade Krasin’s meeting
with Urquhart’s agent makes us hasten with the insertion
of the discussion articles on this question. That is why
I request that Pyatakov’s article should be inserted in
Pravda tomorrow, with the reservation that it is being
carried by way of discussion. The day after, insert
Frumkin’s article, or anyone else’s according to his choice.
 

I think it would be better for us to have both articles
signed, but this requires a re-decision on what was
decided by the Politbureau, that is why the question of
signing the article should be left open until
tonight.[1]

as soon as possible articles on the Urquhart agreement”
consisting of G. L. Pyatakov and B. S. Stomonyakov and approved
instructions for the commission in which it defined the content
of the articles.

The discussion articles under the general title, “On the
Question of the Urquhart Concession Rejected by the C.P.C.”, were
published in several issues of Pravda (October 31, and
November 1 to 3, 1922).

30.X.1922

Comrade Kamenev:

Krzhizhanovsky informed me on Friday
night[1]

that
Comrade Pyatakov erroneously passed the military estimates
at a figure several tens of trillions of rubles higher than
agreed.

Yesterday I learned that you had failed to correct this
mistake in the C.P.C. You propose, as you say, to leave
it for the time being. Having thought about this I find
that this is an extremely dangerous and unreliable way,
which is incorrect in principle, and is inconvenient in
every respect.

I propose that we meet at my place today, on Monday,
either from 1 to 2, or from 6 to 7, together with Stalin
(Zinoviev and Molotov) and agree on convening the
Politbureau, I think, this very day.

The C.P.C. decision should be reversed at once, and
Pyatakov reprimanded. Otherwise, we shall find ourselves
entangled for a long time; I am very sorry for my proposal
(which is a late one), but I cannot do otherwise.

I am sending a copy to Comrade
Stalin.[2]


With communist greetings,


Lenin

Krzhizhanovsky has told me that this was a mistake on
Pyatakov’s part (the State Planning Commission Deputy
Chairman). Such mistakes should not be allowed. I think
Pyatakov should be politely requested not to make any
such mistakes in the future.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on L. B. Kamenev’s letter to Lenin of October 30, 1922,
proposing, in the event of Lenin’s agreement: =

“1) to ask the
Politbureau to rescind the C.P.C. decision, restoring the figure
proposed by the People’s Commissariat for Finance, i.e., 599,000,000
million minus 26,000,000 million equals 573,000,000 million; =

2) suggest that the Politbureau should appoint a special
commission to review the allocation of the appropriated funds under
the estimates between the various People’s Commissariats in order
to reduce expenditures in shipbuilding, etc.” =

Under this proposal,
Lenin wrote: “I quite agree. 30.X.1922. Lenin.” There are also
remarks by G. Y. Zinoviev, J. V. Stalin and V. M. Molotov
saying that they agree, and one by L. D. Trotsky, abstaining
(Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

31/X.1922

To Comrade Chicherin and all members of the Politbureau

I have no time now to weigh with sufficient
consideration all the expressions in the draft Note to the Entente,
which I believe to be very important. I think that every
word should be checked two or three times to see that it
does not mean that we shall refuse to attend the conference.

In that sense, the Note should be especially
“diplomatic”. It seemed to me that at the end of the Note, which T
gave a very cursory glance, there are expressions which are
not sufficiently diplomatic in this sense.

It would be well to have a book published as a
textbook: a review of all the countries of the world; who owes
whom how much; the advantageous and essential sources
of revenue in each country.

In sum, a vivid and laconic picture of shameless
domination by four imperialist powers (we shall translate it into
all the languages; turn it into a textbook, making
additions every two years).

The map should be clear.

The map should show the chief values;
    —the chief debts;

all this presented visually, in diagrams, etc.

Upon examining the estimates of the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture, the inter-departmental conference
has refused to include the Gossemkultura estimates in the
P.C.A. budget, proposing that it request a loan from the
State Bank, which, instead of the 3.5 trillion rubles
required for the first quarter, is prepared to give only one
trillion.

Attaching great state importance to the work of the
Shatilov Trust, and being sure that improvement in plant
varieties on the American model is a most important basis
for increasing the productivity of our agriculture, I request
a review of the decision taken by the inter-departmental
conference, so as to satisfy the needs of Gossemkultura as
far as possible.
 

I enclose as material a copy of Comrade Teodorovich’s
statement and a copy of Comrade Osinsky’s letter, with
which I am in full
agreement.[1]

Comrade Bryukhanov
People’s Commissariat for Food

I have been informed that, because of the rainy summer,
great quantities of grain are being delivered to the
grain-collecting stations in a moist state. It is feared that it
will easily heat up and lose its economic value.

Please let me know whether this is true, and whether
the necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the
collected grain, and also who is personally in charge of
this on the all-Russia scale.

Gleb Maximilianovich informs me that a great threat
to the tax in kind lies in the delayed delivery of
considerable quantities of food, reaching 10,000 carloads at the
points of destination—Moscow, Petrograd, Samara,
Rybinsk, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and others, which is due to
a shortage of storage space at the points of destination
and general delays in discharging.

It looks as though no favourable results have yet been
achieved by re-routing freight from one point to another,
because even after re-routing to other points, the freight
cars are kept under discharge for weeks, waiting for
sacking and storage space.

An especially dangerous moment now seems to be coming
up because the warehouses are full up.

Please let me know the present state of the unloading

    

of grain, and the measures being taken by the People’s
Commissariat for Food to accelerate it.

Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

Comrade Krzhizhanovsky, State Planning Commission
Copy to Comrade Sokolnikov, People’s Commissariat for
Finance

I am sending you copies of two letters from Comrade
Chubar, in which he argues that the decision of the Council
of Labour and Defence, of October 13, about Donbas has
been overthrown by life
itself.[1]

The question should be urgently reviewed in full, with
the participation of the People’s Commissariat for Finance
and the All-Russia Central T.U.C. It is necessary, at all
costs, to find a solution for all questions, ensuring the
normal operation of Donbas, and making it independent
of the continued decline in the ruble’s rate.

I consider this to be of exceptional urgency and request
the State Planning Commission specially to concentrate on
this
work.[2]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the C.L.D. decision of October 13, 1922. telling
prices for fuel for planned consumers.

In his letters, V. Y. Chubar, head of the State Coal Industry
of Donbas, pointed out the discrepancy between the established
firm price for coal and the declining rate of the ruble, adding that
the Slate Planning Commission’s calculations lagged behind life
and placed the industry in an impossible situation. He requested
a settlement of this question.





[2]
On Lenin’s instruction, the State Planning Commission
submitted to the Council of Labour and Defence a report on the financing
of Donbas. This question was discussed by the C.L.D. on
November 15 and 17, 1922, and by the C.P.C. on November 24, The
C.P.C. noted the especial importance of regular operations in
the coal and oil industry for the country’s economy, and
recognised the need “firmly to provide these branches of the fuel industry
with the full amount of real funds required for the implementation
of their production programme, and for that purpose to establish,
by way of exception, special terms of payment for coal and oil”
(Sobranie uzakonenii i rasporyazhenii rabochego i krestyanskogo
pravitelstva, No. 79, 1922, p. 993).

Copy to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs
  ” to Comrade Eiduk

I have information about heavy illegal immigration at
the present time (of Russians and Americans) through

    

various border points, especially through the Black Sea
ports.

The S.E.C. department of industrial immigration
reports that up to 200–300 persons are coming in every
month, (Among those coming in are profiteers,
counter-revolutionaries and people of that sort.)

Please take the most resolute measures to stop such
immigration.

Inform Comrade Gorbunov about the measures you take.

Comrade Chicherin:

Perhaps we should kick at Mussolini and have everyone
(Vorovsky and the whole delegation) leave Italy, starting
to attack her over her fascists?

Let us stage an international demonstration.

This provides a very convenient pretext: you have beaten
our men, you are barbarians, diehards worse than those in
Russia in 1905, etc., etc.

I think we should do this.

Let us give the Italian people some serious
help.[2]

Yours,

Lenin

Written in connection with the following circumstances. On
November 1, 1922, a group of fascists armed with pistols and bombs
raided the Trade Department of the R.S.F.S.R. Mission in Italy.
They broke into the office of the foreign trade agent and at gun
point led away one of the officials and shot him on the stairs.





[2]
On November 1, 1922, the R.S.F.S.R. Mission in Italy sent the
Italian Foreign Ministry a Note of protest over the raid by a group
of fascists on its Trade Department (see Dokumenty vneshnet

1. About Bordiga, I very strongly advise the adoption
of your proposal that we send a letter from our C.C. to the
Italian delegates and insistently recommend that they adopt
the tactics you have outlined, otherwise the actions of the
latter will be highly harmful for the Italian Communists
in everything they subsequently
do.[1]

2. I have read your theses concerning NEP and on the
whole find them very good, and some formulations extremely
felicitous, but a small part of the points seemed to
me to be dubious. I would advise their publication in the
newspapers for the time being, and then re-issue in a
pamphlet without fail. With some comments, they will be
especially appropriate for informing the foreign public
about our New Economic Policy.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Fourth Congress of the Comintern discussed the merger of
the Communist and Socialist Parties of Italy. The leadership
of the Italian Communist Party, at the time in the hands of the
sectarian Bordiga group, came out against the merger.

The R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee sent the Italian
Communist Party delegation a letter advising it not to vote against the
merger resolution which was worked out by a commission. The
I.C.P. delegation accepted the advice.

The congress adopted a unanimous decision on the merger and
set up a special organising committee to put it through. See this
volume, Document 803.

Comrades Trotsky, Zinoviev,
 Bukharin and Radek

I have read the document which you have sent me,
namely, the draft in German entitled “Outline of Agrarian
Action Programme”, compiled mainly by Varga and
approved by the commission, and I very much hesitate to
support it. I feel that the draft gives virtually nothing new
in comparison with the resolution of the Second Congress
of the Comintern on the agrarian question. I very much
fear that some formulations, diverging, perhaps even
accidentally, from the Second Congress resolution, may cause

    

misunderstanding and breed artificial talk about a
discrepancy between this draft and the Second Congress
resolution. There also seems to be a distinct element which
weakens what was said there about supporting the peasant
movement, and which is capable of producing some
dissent between the needy peasantry and the rural proletariat.

I am unable to go into this question in greater detail
and make a sentence-by-sentence collation between Varga’s
draft resolution which you have sent in and the Second
Congress resolution. I consider it necessary to warn that
we should not let ourselves accumulate numerous
resolutions on one and the same question which are capable of
producing misunderstanding and confusion.

As a minimum, I would propose:

1) To collate the new resolution with the Second
Congress resolution sentence by sentence.

2) To give the new resolution the character of something
like a partial commentary.

I personally feel that the new resolution is of very
doubtful
value.[2]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written after a reading of the draft resolution of the Fourth
Congress of the Comintern, “Outline of Agrarian Action Programme”,
which had been sent him. In a covering letter G. Y.
Zinoviev wrote that he felt that he could not submit the draft for
discussion by the congress without Lenin’s comment.





[2]
In accordance with Lenin’s suggestions, the draft resolution of
the Fourth Congress of the Comintern on the agrarian question
was rewritten, in his report to the congress on November 30,
Y. S. Varga set out the content of the letter here published and
said that the commission elected to complete the draft “was
guided in its work above all by Comrade Lenin’s letter”. Changes were
introduced into the “Outline of Agrarian Action Programme”,
the most important of these being the addition of a subtitle,
“Instructions on the Application of the Agrarian Theses of the Second
Congress of the Communist International”, which specified the
nature of the resolution (see Bulletin IV kongressa
Kommunisticheskogo Internatsionala, No. 27, 1922, pp. 11–12).

Copy to Comrade Bogdanov
  ”  to Comrade Fomin

On November 14, the Council of People’s Commissars
examined the question of handing over the
sleeper-impregnation factories from the S.E.C. to the People’s
Commissariat for Railways, and it was decided to do so.

Because I have some doubts about this decision being
correct, I am asking the Presidium of the All-Russia C.E.C.
to make a detailed re-examination of this matter in
substance, giving each side at least 20 minutes to present
their case.
 

A representative of the S.E.C. will report for one side,
and a representative of the People’s Commissariat for
Railways, for the other.

All the material in this case will be presented to you
by the C.P.C. business manager, Comrade Gorbunov, to
whom I have given an assignment to that
effect.[1]

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)


Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Having heard both sides, the All-Russia C.E.C. decided in    

favour of the People’s Commissariat for Railways.

His request for a ship for the Azov Sea should be
supported (I enclose his note).

Lenin

3/XII-22

I know N. M. Knipovich personally as an absolutely
honest man. At one time, he was politically a Plekhanovite,
before that and later, a non-factional Social-Democrat. His
opinion can and must be regarded as being fully reliable.
Knipovich has a thorough and scientific knowledge of the
fishing industry: he has been studying it for 37 years.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
These are apparently extracts from two letters which have not
been found. They must have been written in connection with
Lenin’s talk on December 2, 1922, with Prof. N. M. Knipovich,
head of the scientific and industrial expedition to the Azov Sea.
Knipovich was requesting assistance in securing the ship
Besstrashny for scientific exploration by the Central Administration of
the Fishing Industry (Glavryba) under the People’s Commissariat
for Food.

On December 15, 1922, the Narrow C.P.C. recognised that “it
is fundamentally necessary to let Glavryba have the free use of
the ship Besstrashny for the expedition”, and instructed the
Budget Commission of the People’s Commissariat for Finance to
review the question of allocating funds to Glavryba for the
purpose.

Comrade Khodorovsky:

Comrade Molotov informs me that you have had
experience in Novo-Nikolayevsk in arranging help from city
cells to rural cells and vice versa. Will you collect material
about this—written or printed—or, if you have no time
to do this before the Congress of Soviets, will you write a

    

couple of words, or perhaps we shall find time to talk it
over.[1]

Lenin

4/XII–22
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

I. I. Khodorovsky soon sent Lenin a reply, saying that this had
been done by way of experiment only in Novonikolayevsk
Gubernia and uyezd (now Novosibirsk Region) and that the question
of the rural cells helping out the urban ones had not come up. See
his article, “From Reminiscences about Ilyich”, published in
(Izvestia TsIK and VTsIK on April 22, 1930.

Lenin used the material received from Khodorovsky in the
plan of his speech at the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets
(which he did not deliver because of ill health), and also in his
article, “Pages from a Diary” (see present edition, Vol. 33 pp. 
465–66).

1. I have information that the Administration for the
Island Economy of the Arctic Ocean is selling alcohol to
the Novaya Zemlya settlers and is making drunkards out
of the natives.

It is alleged that the Administration sets such
plunderous prices that the settlers try to sell the products of
their industry to visiting Norwegian trappers, who offer
less plunderous prices for their goods.

2. I have been informed that as a result of the sharp
decline in the fishing industry during the war the
searoach, which had almost lost its commercial importance
through rapacious fishing, has once again appeared in
commercial quantities in the Sea of Azov. Much young fish
of the sturgeon species, including the almost extinct white
sturgeon, has also appeared. But on the one hand, there
has been started at once unchecked and unrestricted
plunderous catching of young sturgeon, which could quickly
cancel out the favourable effect of the war. On the other
hand, something inconceivable has allegedly been
happening, and perhaps is still happening, in the lower reaches
of the Don. As an example I have been told that even the
water guards of the Don Food Committee have engaged
in plunderous fishing in the restricted zone, with a sort
of charge allegedly being levied for permission to catch
fish in the restricted area—between 400 and 500 million
rubles for one net casting.

The chief of the water guard service of the Don Food
Committee has been removed from his post for plunderous

    

fishing in the lower reaches of the Don. This gentleman has
merely been removed from his post. It is necessary to find
out where he is and to make a more serious check up on
whether he has been sufficiently punished.

Please appoint an inquiry into both cases and inform
me through Comrade Gorbunov of the results in a short note.

These people should not just be given a scare, but
should also be brought to book and taken to task for these
scandalous practices.

To the highly esteemed Charles Proteus Steinmetz, one
of the few exceptions to the united front of representatives
of science and culture opposed to the proletariat.

I hope that a further deepening and widening of the
breach in this front will not have to be awaited long. Let
the example of the Russian workers and peasants holding
their fate in their own hands serve as an encouragement
to the American proletariat and farmers. In spite of the
terrible consequence of the war destruction we are going
ahead, though not possessing to the extent of one tenth
the tremendous resources for the economic building of a
new life that have been at the disposal of the American
people for many
years.[1]

Comrade Zinoviev:

I do not in the slightest suspect you of being biased
about Rozhkov.

Not in the slightest!

But in substance I very much fear that he will lie all
he can, even if it is in the press. He will lie and we shall
be circumvented.

That is what I fear.

Their slogan is: lie, leave the Party, remain in Russia.

That is what we must think and talk
about.[1]

Yours,

Lenin

A reference to the deportation of a once active Menshevik,
N. A. Rozhkov. The question of Rozhkov was repeatedly
discussed by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C., which on                
-
October 26, 1922, adopted this decision: “Rozhkov to be deported.”
On December 7, reverting the decision of October 26, the
Politbureau decided to postpone his deportation and published in
Izvestia VTsIK his article on Menshevik activity and announcement
of withdrawal from the Menshevik Party, together with comments by the
editor Y. M. Steklov (Central Party Archives of the
Institute Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).

 Comrade Stalin

Comrade Stalin:

I question the legality of yesterday’s decision about
Rozhkov, because:

first, this decision, contrary to custom and rules, had
not been entered on the agenda before 12.00;

second, the documents were not communicated to C.C.
members beforehand;

third, there was no ground for haste after a twofold
discussion of the question, especially since I was present
at the first part of the sitting, and the question came up
just when I had to leave. That is why I insist on referring
the matter to the plenum, especially because only a week
remains before it
meets.[1]

On the question of Lozovsky, I propose that the time
which has been made available should go into a more
thorough search for the necessary
candidates.[2]
 

We, as a Party, have already devoted an unconscionable
amount of energy to the Comintern, and, consequently,
to the Profintern as well. If Lozovsky has proved to be
independently not quite satisfactory, there is need to
recruit fresh forces either from among the foreigners, or
among workers who would in no case be used otherwise,
i.e., either for organisational, or practical, or
administrative work. That is why it is quite impossible to take
Kalnin who, I have heard, has started rather important and,
unless I am mistaken, rather successful work in Donbas.
On no account either should there simply be an
appointment of Tomsky, because he is swamped with work at the
All-Russia Central T.U.C., which is rendered extremely
difficult by the shortage of men. If necessary, I propose
the appointment of Tomsky and Rudzutak to have them
devote to this new duty not more than 30 minutes a day,
with the compulsory engagement of two or more
secretaries who know foreign languages and who are capable of
keeping Tomsky and Rudzutak informed in every detail.
I propose that an assignment to find such secretaries be
given to the Orgbureau or the Secretariat, provided they
are not removed from any post which our Party needs.

I draw attention to the fact that if men like Rothstein
are not used, this is a clear indication of crying anarchy
in the administrative arrangements of the Profintern and
the Comintern, because, at any rate, such men have proved
by their long work that they are quite suitable for
literary activity, for example, in the old Neue
Zeit[3];
there is no doubt that given the necessary secretarial
assistance these men will be of exceptional benefit, and the
required secretaries can and must be recruited not from
among Russians but foreigners. It is high time that an end
should be put to the drawing of forces from our Party for
the benefit of the Comintern and the Profintern.

I propose that a relevant proposal should be sent to
the C.C. Secretariat or the
Orgbureau.[4]

Lenin

On December 14, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
rescinded its decision of December 7 and decided to exile
Rozhkov to Pskov, and to deport him from Soviet Russia at the first
anti-Soviet act.

On November 30, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C.
instructed the Orgbureau of the C.C. to place at the disposal of
the Comintern up to 10 functionaries within a week.

The Kremlin, Moscow, December 11, 1922

Dear Comrade Lazzari,

I thank you very much for the kind greetings you have
sent me through Comrade Maffi, and send you my best
wishes.

Unfortunately, because of my
illness,[1]

I have not been
able to follow your activities since the Third Congress of
the Communist International. There is now the most
delicate task to cope with. The congress has decided upon
the merger and it should be promoted to the best of one’s
abilities.[3] I am sure that you will use all your authority
and the enthusiasm of the old devoted revolutionary to
achieve the great purpose which we set ourselves, that of
establishing a solid and sincere union of all true
revolutionaries.

I count on you especially in case Serrati may create
obstacles, even though against his will: the distrust from
the past is so great that he must not only be most loyal
(this goes without saying), but must prove this in every
way. What is more, he must especially find all possible
methods (he is rather adroit and flexible in this) to avoid
giving any pretext for mistrust on the part of the
Communists. Unfortunately, my illness has prevented me from
saying this personally to
Serrati.[2]


Best regards, wishing you good
health,[4]

Lenin
To Fotieva or the secretary on duty

Please retype, correcting my French, and return to me.

[3]
A reference to the resolution of the Fourth Congress of the
Comintern (held from November 5 to December 5, 1922) on the
Italian question providing for the merger of the Communist
and Socialist Parties of Italy (see Kommunistichesky Internatsional
v dokumentakh. Resheniya, tezisy i vozzvaniya kongressov
Kominterna i plenumov IKKI. 1919–1932. Moscow, 1938, pp. 356–60).

At the time, the merger did not take place. In 1924, some groups
of socialists which had formed the Left wing of the Italian
Socialist Party broke with it and entered the Communist Party (see
this volume, Document 794).





[4]
On January 2, 1923, C. Lazzari sent Lenin a reply letter
thanking him for the trust placed in him and promising to do
everything he could to implement the decisions of the Fourth Congress
of the Comintern. However, he objected to the outlined methods
for merging the parties and, referring to the services of the
Italian Socialist Party, suggested that the unified party should
have the old name—Italian Socialist Party (Central Party Archives

   

of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee).

A reference to a letter from N. N. Krestinsky, R.S.F.S.R.
Plenipotentiary Representative in Germany, of December 3, 1922. He
gave a positive evaluation to the work of the trade mission in
Berlin, reported agreements with some German firms, described
the talks being conducted and the great prospects in this respect.
He wrote that these would be destroyed with the lifting of the
foreign trade monopoly. It is indicative, he added, that “some
comrades who have been abroad are becoming supporters of the
monopoly (Tsyurupa, Vladimirov, Rykov, Avanesov)”. On the
strength of the experience gained abroad, Krestinsky took a firm
stand in favour of the foreign trade monopoly (Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee). See also next document.

Comrade Trotsky
Copy to Frumkin and Stomonyakov

Comrade Trotsky:

I have received your comments on Krestinsky’s letter
and Avanesov’s
plans.[2] I think that you and I are in
maximum agreement, and I believe that the State Planning
Commission question, as presented in this case, rules out
(or postpones) any discussion on whether the State
Planning Commission needs to have any administrative
rights.[3]

At any rate, it is my request that at the forthcoming
plenum you should undertake the defence of our common
standpoint on the unquestionable need to maintain and
consolidate the foreign trade monopoly. Since the
preceding plenum passed a decision in this respect which runs
entirely counter to the foreign trade monopoly, and since
there can be no concessions on this matter, I believe, as
I say in my letter to Frumkin and
Stomonyakov,[1]

that in
the event of our defeat on this question we must refer the
question to a Party Congress. This will require a brief
exposition of our differences before the Party group of the

    

forthcoming Congress of
Soviets.[4] If I have time, I shall
write this, and I would be very glad if you did the same.
Hesitation on this question is doing us unprecedented
harm, and the negative arguments boil down entirely to
accusations of shortcomings in the apparatus. But our
apparatus is everywhere imperfect, and to abandon the
monopoly because of an imperfect apparatus would be
throwing out the baby with the bath water.

Lenin

A reference to L. D. Trotsky’s letter of December 12, 1922.

By “Avanesov’s plans” Lenin means the “Proposals of the
C.P.C. Commission of Inquiry into the Work of R.S.F.S.R.
Missions Abroad on the Question of the Slate Monopoly of Foreign
Trade”.

Its main conclusion was that the foreign trade monopoly must
not be abolished for both economic and political reasons, “either
fully or even in part” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee).





[3]
In his letter, L. D. Trotsky wrote that there was need for a
flexible regulation of foreign trade, adapted to overall economic
requirements, and said he believed it was the State Planning
Commission’s job to do this.

I am now through with putting my business in order,
and am in a position to leave without
worry.[1] I have
also come to an arrangement with Trotsky to stand up for
my views of the foreign trade monopoly. There is only one
thing that is worrying me extremely—it is that I am unable
to speak at the Congress of
Soviets.[2] On Tuesday, I shall
have the doctors in to see me and we shall discuss whether

    

there is any chance at all of my doing so. I would regard
my missing it as a great inconvenience, to put it no
stronger. I have had the outline of my speech written several
days
ago.[3] I propose, therefore, without suspending
preparations by some other speaker in my place, to keep open
until Wednesday the possibility that I will perhaps
personally make a speech, much shorter than the usual one,
say, lasting 45 minutes. Such a speech would in no way
prevent a substitute (whomsoever you would authorise for
that purpose) from making a speech, but I think it would
be useful both in the political and in the personal sense,
because it would remove any cause for great agitation.
Please have this in mind, and if the opening of the congress
should be further delayed, inform me in good time through
my
secretary.[4]

Lenin

15.XII.1922

I am resolutely opposed to any delay on the question
of the foreign trade monopoly. If the idea should arise,
for whatever reason (including the proposition that my
participation in the question is desirable), to postpone it
until the next plenum, I should most resolutely object to
this, because I am sure that Trotsky will be able to stand
up for my views just as well as I myself. That is the first
thing. The second is that your statement and Zinoviev’s
and, according to rumour, Kamenev’s as well, confirm
that some members of the C.C. have already altered their
earlier opinion; third, and most important: any further
hesitation on this highly important question is absolutely
intolerable and will tend to frustrate any work.

Lenin

15.XII.22
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Lenin’s removal to Gorki, as ordered by his
doctors in view of a deterioration in the state of his health.





[2]
A reference to the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets.





[3]
For the plan of Lenin’s speech at the Tenth All-Russia Congress
of Soviets see present edition, Vol. 36, pp. 588–89. Preparing for
the speech long before the congress, as far back as November 1922,
Lenin began to collect the necessary material: he asked for books
and newspaper cuttings, read the report of V. P. Milyutin,
Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Economic Council, on the state of
trade, finance and industry, and wrote a letter to I. I.
Khodorovsky asking him for information about the assistance given to each
other by urban and rural cells of the Party. Judging by the plan,

   

he intended to deal with a number of questions which he later
analysed in his last articles.





[4]
Lenin’s health took a turn for the worse and he was unable to
participate in the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets. On the
night of December 16, Nadezhda Krupskaya asked the secretary
on duty “to inform Stalin, on behalf of Vladimir Ilyich, that
he will not speak at the Congress of Soviets” (see Collected Works,
Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol. 45, p. 473).

The Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets opened in Moscow
on December 23, 1922. It was attended by 2,215 delegates. Lenin
was elected honorary chairman; to stormy applause and the
singing of The Internationale the congress adopted a telegram of
greetings to Lenin.

On December 26, the congress heard a report on the unification
of the Soviet Republics, and the next day, at its final sitting,
adopted a decision declaring the need to establish a Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics.

Comrade Trotsky:

I consider that we have quite reached agreement. I ask
you to declare our solidarity at the plenum. I hope that
our decision will be passed, because some of those who
had voted against it in October have now partially or
altogether switched to our
side.[1]


If for some reason our decision should not be passed,
we shall apply to the group of the Congress of Soviets,
and declare that we are referring the question to the Party
congress.

In that case, inform me and I shall send in my
statement.

Yours,

Lenin

P.S. If this question should be removed from the
present plenum (which I do not expect, and against which
you should, of course, protest as strongly as you can on
our common behalf), I think that we should apply to the
group of the Congress of Soviets anyway, and demand that
the question be referred to the Party congress, because
any further hesitation is absolutely intolerable.

You can keep all the material I have sent you until
after the
plenum.[2]

 Comrade Trotsky

Comrade Trotsky:

I am sending on to you Frumkin’s letter which 1 have
received
today.[1] I also think that it is absolutely
necessary to have done with this question once and for all. If

    

there are any fears that I am being worried by this
question and that it could even have an effect on my health,
I think that this is absolutely wrong, because I am
infinitely more worried by the delay which makes our policy
on one of the most basic questions quite unstable. That
is why I call your attention to the enclosed letter and ask
you to support an immediate discussion of this question.
I am sure that if we are threatened with the danger of
failure, it would be much better to fail before the Party
congress, and at once to apply to the group of the congress,
than to fail after the congress. Perhaps, an acceptable
compromise is that we pass a decision just now confirming
the monopoly, and still bring up the question at the Party
congress, making an arrangement about this right away.
I do not believe that we could accept any other
compromise either in our own interests or the interests of the cause.

Letter to the
Deputies[1]


1. Rykov should be given the State Planning
Commission.[2]


2. I think that we should employ 6 shorthand writers
recording every interview briefly, in 3 or 4 lines, naturally
confining this only to the essence of what is agreed and
to the main—two or three—figures.

I think this is necessary to have the work of the three
deputies concerted, and second, to make it possible to

    

think again about the decisions taken on the run, and to
compare the results of the measures taken after a few weeks.

Gorbunov should be assigned the organisation of this
whole apparatus of stenographic note-taking, and strict
supervision to see that it works quite well.

3. Please make a brief record—roughly on one page—
of the decision you have finally taken with respect to the
statistician Popov. I do not intend to question this decision
just now, but believe that within a few weeks we shall
need a precise record of the charges and the
defence.[3]

It looks as though it has been possible to take the
position without a single shot, by a simple manoeuvre. I
suggest that we should not stop and should continue the
offensive, and for that purpose put through a motion to raise
at the Party congress the question of consolidating our
foreign trade, and the measures to improve its
implementation. This to be announced in the group of the Congress
of Soviets. I hope that you will not object to this, and will
not refuse to give a report in the group.

Notes
 
 



[1]
On December 18, 1922, the Plenum of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee rescinded a decision taken by the plenum in October,
and reaffirmed “the absolute need to maintain and effect the
organisational strengthening of the foreign trade monopoly” (Central
Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
C.P.S.U. Central Committee). The Twelfth Party Congress, held
in Moscow from April 17 to 25, 1923, also confirmed that the
foreign trade monopoly was not to be tampered with.

Dear Comrade Trotsky:

It is my earnest request that you should undertake the
defence of the Georgian case in the Party C.C. This case
is now under “persecution” by Stalin and Dzerzhinsky,
and I cannot rely on their impartiality. Quite to the
contrary. I would feel at ease if you agreed to undertake its
defence. If you should refuse to do so for any reason,
return the whole case to me. I shall consider it a sign that
you do not
accept.[3]

With best comradely greetings

Lenin[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
A separate sheet, appended to the present letter, contains this
note by a secretary: “Comrade Trotsky: To the letter
communicated to you by phone, Vladimir Ilyich asked to add for your information
that Comrade Kamenev is going to Georgia on Wednesday, and wants
to know whether you wish to send anything there yourself. March 
5, 23.”—Ed.
 



[2]
The letter is connected with the “Georgian question”.

After the October (1922) Plenum of the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee, there was a sharpening of the conflict between the
Transcaucasian Territorial Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) and the
Mdivani group (see Note 723). Having met with resistance from
the Georgian Communists, the Central Committee of the
Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Georgia, on which the Mdivani group
had a majority, resigned on October 22 on the plea of its
differences with the Transcaucasian Territorial Committee. Mdivani’s
supporters lodged a complaint with the R.C.P.(B.) Central
Committee. On November 25, 1922, the Politbureau adopted a
decision to send a commission to Georgia, with F. E. Dzerzhinsky
at its head, to examine urgently the statements by members of
the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party who had

   

resigned, and to work out measures to establish tranquility in
the Georgian Communist Party.

Lenin was highly anxious over the “Georgian question”. On
December 12, Dzerzhinsky reported to Lenin the results of his
trip. Lenin was dissatisfied with the work of the commission,
believing that it had taken a biased approach to the conflict, and
had failed to note the grave errors made by G. K. Orjonikidze.
Lenin connected the “Georgian question” with the general
question of establishing the U.S.S.R., expressing alarm over whether
the principles of proletarian internationalism would be
consistently implemented in the unification of the Republics. In his
letter, “The Question of Nationalities, or ‘Autonomisation’”,
he censured Orjonikidze’s action and the connivance at it on the
part of the Dzerzhinsky Commission, and of Stalin. Lenin placed
the political responsibility for the whole affair chiefly on Stalin,
who was the C.C. Secretary General, with reference to his grave
mistakes in unifying the Republics (see present edition, Vol. 36,
pp. 605–11).

Lenin, far from supporting, in fact criticised the
fundamentally erroneous stand of Mdivani and his supporters on various
aspects of the Transcaucasian Federation and the formation of
the U.S.S.R. (see this volume, Document 777); but considering
that at the time the main danger lay in dominant-nation
chauvinism, and that the task of fighting the latter was to be shouldered
mainly by the Communists of the formerly dominant nation,
Lenin concentrated attention on the mistakes made by Stalin,
Dzerzhinsky and Orjonikidze on the “Georgian question”. He
pointed out that in this matter, especially when, in connection
with the unification of the Republics, there was need for
“particular circumspection, tact and tractability”, and that “in this case
it is better to overdo the tractability and mildness in treating
the national minorities than to underdo them”. That is the
context in which to view Lenin’s words about his being “on the side
of the ‘offended’ in the ‘Georgian conflict’” (see this volume,
Document 814, and also Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition,
Vol. 45, p. 486).

Lenin’s letter to Trotsky was written in connection with the
forthcoming discussion of the “Georgian question” at a Plenum
of the R.C.P.(B.) Central Committee.





[3]
This letter was read to Trotsky the same day on the phone by
Maria Volodicheva, assistant secretary of the C.L.D. and the
C.P.C. On the plea of ill health, Trotsky said he could not
undertake such an obligation.

Copy to Comrades Kamenev and Zinoviev

Dear Comrade Stalin:

You have been so rude as to summon my wife to the
telephone and use bad language. Although she had told

    

you that she was prepared to forget this, the fact
nevertheless became known through her to Zinoviev and Kamenev.
I have no intention of forgetting so easily what has been
done against me, and it goes without saying that what
has been done against my wife I consider having been done
against me as well. I ask you, therefore, to think it over
whether you are prepared to withdraw what you have said
and to make your apologies, or whether you prefer that
relations between us should be broken
off.[1]

Respectfully yours,
Lenin

March 5, 1923
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the following fact. After Lenin, with the
permission of his doctors, had, on December 21, 1922, dictated a letter
to Trotsky on the foreign trade monopoly (see this volume,
Document 811), J. V. Stalin, whom a C.C. Plenum decision of
December 18 had made personally responsible for the observance of
the medical regimen ordered for Lenin, used offensive language

   

against Nadezhda Krupskaya and threatened to take the case to
the Control Commission for having taken down the said letter.
On December 23, 1922, Krupskaya sent Kamenev a letter asking
for protection from “the gross interference in my personal life,
offensive language and threats”.


Nadezhda Krupskaya apparently told Lenin of this fact in early
March 1923. Having learned about this Lenin dictated the
document here published. 

Maria Ulyanova later wrote in a letter to the presidium of the
July (1926) Joint Plenum of the Central Committee and the
Central Control Commission of the R.C.P.(B.), at which the question
had been raised by G. Y. Zinoviev, one of the leaders of the “new
opposition”, that Stalin had offered his apologies.

Copy to Comrades Trotsky and Kamenev

Dear Comrades:

I am following your case with all my heart. I am
indignant over Orjonikidze’s rudeness and the connivance of
Stalin and Dzerzhinsky. I am preparing for you notes and
a
speech.[1]

Respectfully yours,


Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
See Note 765.

Lenin was unable to prepare the letter and the speech on the    
“Georgian question”. On March 10, 1923, there was an acute    
deterioration in his condition.

This letter is the last document dictated by Lenin.
