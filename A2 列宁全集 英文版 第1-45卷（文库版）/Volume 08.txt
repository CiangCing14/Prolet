## Preface







LCW: 8: Preface by Progress Publishers







Lenin
      Collected Works: Volume 8: Preface by Progress Publishers 




Lenin Collected Works: 
Volume 8
Preface by Progress Publishers



    Volume 8 contains the works of Lenin written between January and
    July 1905, during the early period of the first Russian
    revolution. Most of the book consists of articles published in the
    underground Bolshevik newspapers Vperyod and
    Proletary.
  

    The articles “The Autocracy and the Proletariat”,
    “The Fall of Port Arthur”, “European Capital and
    the Autocracy”, and “Debacle” give an analysis of
    the military defeat and political crisis of the autocracy and
    predict the inevitability of the revolution in Russia.
  

    The articles “Two Tactics”, “Should We Organise
    the Revolution?", “New Tasks and New Forces”, “On
    the Provisional Revolutionary Government”, “The
    Revolutionary- Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the
    Peasantry”, and “The Revolutionary Army and the
    Revolutionary Government” examine and develop the
    revolutionary tactics of the Bolshevik Party and expose and
    criticise the opportunist tactics of the Mensheviks.
  

    Lenin's campaign against the splitting activities of the Mensheviks
    and for preparing the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.—the
    first Bolshevik congress—is unfolded in his articles
    “Time to Call a Halt!", “A Brief Outline of the Split in
    the R.S.D.L.P.", “General Plan of the Third Congress
    Decisions”, “Draft Resolutions for the Third Congress of
    the R.S.D.L.P.", “The First Step”, “What the
    Bonapartists Are Up To”, “The Second Step”, and
    “Open Letter to Comrade Plekhanov, Chairman of the Council of
    the R.S.D.L.P."
  

    A considerable part of the volume consists of documents pertaining
    to the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.—Lenin's reports and
    speeches at the Congress, and resolutions

    

    drafted by him on the armed uprising, on the provisional
    revolutionary government, on support to the peasant movement, on the
    events in the Caucasus, and on other questions.
  

    The volume includes articles directed against bourgeois liberalism,
    such as “The Agrarian Programme of the Liberals”,
    “Political Sophisms”, “The First Steps of
    Bourgeois Betrayal”, "'Revolutionaries' in Kid
    Gloves”, and “The Struggle of the Proletariat and the
    Servility of the Bourgeoisie".
  

    Fourteen articles and briefer items, published for the first time in
    the Collected Works of Lenin, are devoted to an analysis of
    the revolutionary events in Russia and to questions pertaining to
    the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
  

    In his article “Revolution in Russia”, Lenin for the
    first time evaluates the events of January 9 as the beginning of
    the revolution and salutes the insurgent proletariat. His articles
    “The First Steps”, “The Eve of Bloody
    Sunday”, “The Number of Killed or Wounded”,
    “The Battles on the Barricades”, and
    “St. Petersburg After January 9" deal with the early days of
    the revolutionary struggle in St. Petersburg and with the growing
    political consciousness of the Russian proletariat.
  

    In his “First of May” leaflet, Lenin sets forth the
    tasks of the proletariat and the peasantry in the revolution and
    calls for the preparation of the popular armed uprising.
  

    The item “Conferences of the Committees” reports on the
    conferences of the local committees which went on record for the
    immediate convocation of the Third Party Congress. The article
    “From the New-Iskra Camp” exposes the
    systematic deception of the Party by the Mensheviks.
  

    The documents “Resolution on the Armed Uprising”,
    “Speech on the Procedure of the Discussion of the Resolutions
    on the Relations Between Workers and Intellectuals Within the
    Social-Democratic Organisations”, “Resolution on the
    Publication of the Congress Proceedings”, and “Draft
    Resolution on the Events in the Caucasus” pertain to the
    materials of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
  

    In the short article “The New Russian Loan” Lenin deals
    with the decline of the tsarist government's credit abroad due to
    the military defeats and the growing discontent within the country.

Russia is experiencing a resurgence of the constitutional movement. Our
      generation has never witnessed anything like the present political
      ferment. Legal newspapers are attacking the bureaucracy, demanding
      participation of the people’s representatives in the state administration,
      and pressing for liberal reforms. All varieties of meetings of
      Zemstvo officials,[3]

doctors, lawyers, engineers, farmers,
    municipal councillors,[4]

etc., etc., are adopting resolutions more or less
    definitely demanding a constitution. Passionate appeals for liberty and
    political accusations of a boldness to which the Russian man in the street
    is unaccustomed can be heard at every turn. Under pressure of the workers
    and the radical youth, liberal gatherings are converted into open public
    meetings and street demonstrations. Undercurrents of discontent are
    manifestly stirring among wide sections of the proletariat, among the poor
    of town and country. Although the proletariat is taking a comparatively
    small part in the more spectacular and ceremonious manifestations of the
    liberal movement, although it seems to be standing somewhat aloof from the
    polite conferences of the solid citizens, everything points to the fact that
    the workers are keenly interested in the movement. Everything points to the
    fact that the workers are eager for big public meetings and open street
    demonstrations. The proletariat is holding itself back, as it were,
    carefully taking its bearings, gathering its forces, and deciding the
    question whether or not the moment for the decisive struggle for freedom has
    come.


Apparently, the wave of liberal excitation is beginning to subside somewhat. The
rumours and foreign newspaper re ports to the effect that reactionaries have
gained the upper hand in the most influential Court circles are being
confirmed. The ukase of Nicholas II, published the other day, was a direct slap
in the face for the liberals.[5]

The tsar intends to

    

preserve and uphold the autocratic regime. The tsar does not want
to change the form of government and has no intention of granting a
constitution. He promises—only promises—all manner of reforms
of a quite paltry nature. No guarantees, of course, are given that these
reforms will really be implemented. Police restrictions against the liberal
press are becoming daily and hourly more stringent. All open demonstrations
are being suppressed again, if anything, with greater severity than
before. The screw is being put on the liberal councillors again, both
Zemstvo[6]

and municipal, still more so in the case of those officials who play the
liberal. The liberal newspapers are falling into a despondent tone and
apologising to their correspondents for not publishing their letters, which
they dare not do.  

It is quite within the realm of possibility that the wave of liberal agitation
which rose so rapidly after the permission granted by
Svyatopolk-Mirsky[7]

will abate just as quickly after the new ban. One must
distinguish between the profound causes, which inevitably and unavoidably
lead—and will lead more and more—to opposition and struggle against
the autocracy, and the trivial reasons of a passing liberal ferment. The
profound causes lead to profound, powerful, and persistent popular
movements. Trivial reasons are at times Cabinet changes or the usual attempt on
the part of the government to pursue for an hour the policy of âthe sly
foxâ after some terrorist act. The assassination of Plehve[8]

evidently cost the terrorist organisation tremendous effort and involved
long preparation. The very success of this terrorist act hears out all the more
strikingly the experience of the entire history of the Russian revolutionary
movement, which warns us against such methods of struggle as terrorism. Russian
terrorism has always been a specifically intellectualist method of
struggle. And whatever may be said of the importance of terrorism, not in lieu
of, but in conjunction with, the people’s movement, the facts irrefutably
testify that in our country individual political assassinations have nothing in
common with the forcible actions of the people’s revolution. In capitalist
society a mass movement is possible only as a class movement of the
workers. This movement is developing in Russia according to its own independent
laws; it is proceeding in its own way, gaining in depth and in breadth, and

    

passing from a temporary lull to a new upsurge. It is only the liberal wave
that rises and falls strictly in accord with the moods of the different
ministers, whose replacement is accelerated by bombs. Small wonder, then,
that sympathy with terrorism is to be met with so often in our country
among the radical (or radical-posing) representatives of the bourgeois
Opposition. Small wonder that; among the revolutionary intelligentsia, the
people most likely to be carried away (whether for long or for a moment) by
terrorism are those who have no faith in the vitality and strength of the
proletariat and the proletarian class struggle.  

The fact that the spurt of liberal activity for one or another reason is
short-lived and unstable cannot, of course, make us forget the irremovable
contradiction that exists between the autocracy and the needs of the developing
bourgeois society. The autocracy is bound to be a drag on social
development. The interests of the bourgeoisie as a class, as well as
the interests of
the intelligentsia, without which modern capitalist production is inconceivable,
clash more and more with the autocracy as time goes on. Superficial though the
reason for the liberals’ declarations may be and petty though the character of
the liberals’ half-hearted and equivocal position, the autocracy can maintain
real peace only with a handful of highly privileged magnates from the landowning
and merchant class, but in no sense with that class as a whole. Direct
representation of the interests of the ruling class in the form of a
constitution is essential for a country that wants to be a European country and,
on pain of political and economic defeat, is obliged by its position to become a
European country. It is therefore extremely important for the class-conscious
proletariat to have a clear understanding both of the inevitability of the
liberals’ protests against the autocracy and of the actual bourgeois character
of these protests.


The working class is setting itself the great and epoch- making aims of
liberating humanity from every form of oppression and exploitation of man by
man. Throughout the World it has striven hard for decades on end to achieve
these aims, steadily widening its struggle and organising itself in mass
parties, undaunted by occasional defeats and temporary set-backs. Nothing can be
more vital for such a truly revolutionary class than to rid itself of all
self-deception, of all

    

mirages and illusions.One of the most widespread and persistent illusions with
      us in Russia is the notion that our liberal movement is not a bourgeois
      movement, and that the impending revolution in Russia will not be a
      bourgeois revolution. The Russian intellectual, from the most moderate
    Osvobozhdeniye liberal[9]

to the most extreme Socialist-Revolutionary,[10]

always thinks that one makes our revolution
    colourless, that one degrades and vulgarises it, by admitting it to be a
    bourgeois revolution. To the Russian class-conscious proletarian this
    admission is the only true class characterisation of the actual state of
    affairs. To the proletarian the struggle for political liberty and a
    democratic republic in a bourgeois society is only one of the necessary
    stages in the struggle for the social revolution which will overthrow the
    bourgeois system. Strictly differentiating between stages that are
    essentially different, soberly examining the conditions under which they
    manifest themselves, does not at all mean indefinitely postponing one’s
    ultimate aim, or slowing down one’s progress in advance. On the contrary, it
    is for the purpose of accelerating the advance and of achieving the ultimate
    aim as quickly and securely as possible that it is necessary to understand
    the relation of classes in modern society. Nothing but disillusionment and
    unending vacillation await those who shun the allegedly one-sided class
    point of view, who would be socialists, yet are afraid openly to call the
    impending revolution in Russia—the revolution that has begun in
    Russia—a bourgeois revolution.


Characteristically, at the very height of the present constitutional movement,
the more democratic of the legal publications took advantage of the unusual
freedom to at tack, not only the âbureaucracyâ, but also the
âexclusive and hence erroneous theory of the class struggleâ which
is alleged to be âscientifically untenableâ (Nasha
Zhizn,[11]

No. 28). If you please, the problem of bringing the
intelligentsia closer to the masses âhas hitherto been dealt with solely
by throwing the emphasis on the class contradictions existing between the masses
and those sections of society from which ... the greater part of the
intelligentsia springsâ. Needless to say, this presentation of the facts
is completely at variance with the real state of affairs. The very opposite is
true. The entire mass of the Russian legally-active uplift intelligentsia, all

    

the old Russian socialists, all political figures of the
Osvobozhdeniye type have always completely ignored the
profound nature of the
class contradictions in Russia in general and in the Russian countryside in
particular. Even the extreme Left Russian radical intelligentsia, the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party, sins most in ignoring this fact; one need only
recall its usual arguments about the âlabouring peasantryâ, or about
the impending revolution being ânot a bourgeois, but a democratic
oneâ.


No, the nearer the moment of revolution draws and the more acute the
constitutional movement becomes, the more strictly must the party of the
proletariat guard its class in dependence and not allow its class demands to be
swamped in general democratic phrases. The more frequently and decidedly the
representatives of so-called society come for ward with what they claim to be
the demands of the whole people, the more relentlessly must the Social-Democrats
expose the class nature of this âsocietyâ. Take the notorious
resolution of the âsecretâ Zemstvo congress. held on
November 6-8.[12]

You will find there, thrust into the background, deliberately hazy and
half-hearted constitutional aspirations. You will find mention there of the
people and society, more often society than the people. You will find the most
detailed and comprehensive suggestions for reforms of the Zemstvo and municipal
institutions — institutions, that is, which represent the interests of the
landowners and the capitalists. You will find mention of reforms in the living
conditions of the peasantry, of the liberation of the peasantry from tutelage,
and of the safeguarding of correct judicial forms. It is quite clear that you
are dealing with representatives of the propertied classes who are only bent on
securing concessions from the autocracy and have no thought of changing in any
way the foundations of the economic system. If people like these want a
âradical [allegedly

       radical][1]

change in the present state of inequality
and oppression of the peasantryâ, it only proves anew that the
Social-Democrats were right in tirelessly stressing the backwardness of the
system and of the

    

living conditions of the peasantry in relation to the general conditions of the
      bourgeois order. The Social-Democrats have always urged that the
      class-conscious proletariat should strictly distinguish in the general
      peasant movement the over-riding interests and demands of the peasant
      bourgeoisie, however much these demands may be veiled and nebulous, and
      in whatever cloak of utopian âlevellingâ the peasant ideology
      (and âSocialist-Revolutionaryâ phrase-mongering) may invest
      them. Take the resolutions of the engineers’ banquet in St. Petersburg on
      December 4. You will find that the 590 banquet guests, and together with
      them the 6,000 engineers who subscribed to the resolution, declared for
      a constitution, âwithout which Russian industry cannot be properly
      protectedâ, while at the same time protesting against the placing of
      government orders with foreign concerns.


Can anyone still fail to see that it is the interests of all sections of the
landowning, commercial, industrial and peas ant bourgeoisie which are at the
bottom of the constitutional aspirations that have erupted to the surface? Are
we to be ’led astray by the fact that these interests are represented by the
democratic intelligentsia, which everywhere and always, in all European
revolutions of the bourgeoisie, has assumed the role of publicists, speakers, and
political leaders?


A grave task now confronts the Russian proletariat. ’The autocracy is
wavering. The burdensome and hopeless war into which it has plunged has
seriously undermined the foundations of its power and rule. It cannot maintain
itself in power now without an appeal to the ruling classes, without the sup
port of the intelligentsia; such an appeal and such support, however, are bound
to lead to constitutional demands. The bourgeois classes are trying to force an
advantage for them selves out of the government’s predicament. The government is
playing a desperate game; it is trying to wriggle out of its difficulties, to
get off with a few paltry concessions, non-political reforms, and non-committal
promises, with which the tsar’s new ukase is replete. Whether this game will
succeed, even temporarily and partially, will in the long run depend on the
Russian proletariat, on the degree of its organisation and the force of its
revolutionary onset. The proletariat must take advantage of the political
situation, which is greatly in its favour. The proletariat must support the
constitutional movement

    

 of the bourgeoisie; it must rouse and rally to its side the broadest
possible sections of the exploited masses, muster all its forces, and start an
uprising at the moment when the government is in the most desperate straits and
popular unrest is at its highest.


What immediate form should the proletariat’s support of the constitutionalists
take? Chiefly, the utilisation of the general unrest for the purpose of carrying
on agitation and organising the least involved and most backward sections of the
working class and the peasantry. Naturally, the organised proletariat,
Social-Democracy, should send its forces among all’ classes of the population;
yet the more independently the classes now act, the more acute the struggle
becomes, and the nearer the moment of the decisive battle approaches, the more
should our work be concentrated on preparing the proletarians and
semi-proletarians themselves for the direct struggle for freedom. At such a
moment only opportunists can qualify the speeches of individual workingmen in
Zemstvo and other public assemblies as a very active struggle, or a new method
of struggle, or the highest type of demonstration. Such manifestations can only
be of quite secondary importance. It is far more important now to turn the
attention of the proletariat to really high and active forms of struggle, such
as the famous mass demonstration in Rostov and a number of mass demonstrations
in the South.[13]

It is far more important now to increase our ranks,
organise our forces, and prepare for an even more direct and open mass conflict.


Of course, there is no suggestion in this that the ordinary day-to-day work of
the Social-Democrats should be abandoned. Social-Democrats will never give up
that work, which they regard as the real preparation for the decisive fight; for
they rely wholly and exclusively on the activity, the class-consciousness, and
the organisation of the proletariat, on its influence among the labouring and
exploited masses. It is a question of pointing out the right road, of calling
attention to the need for going forward, to the harmfulness of tactical
vacillations. The day-to-day work, which the class conscious proletariat should
never forget under any circumstances, includes also the work of
organisation. Without bread and diverse workers’ organisations, and without
their connection with revolutionary Social-Democracy, it is impossible

    

to wage a successful struggle against the autocracy. On the other hand,
      organisational work is impossible without a firm rebuff to the
      disorganising tendencies displayed in our country, as everywhere else, by
      the weak-willed intellectual elements in the Party, who change their
      slogans like gloves; organisational work is impossible without a struggle
      against the absurd and reactionary organisation-as-process
      âtheoryâ, which serves to conceal confusion of every
      description.


The development of the political crisis in Russia will now depend chiefly on the
course of the war with Japan. This war has done more than anything else to
expose the rottenness of the autocracy; it is doing more than anything else to
drain its strength financially and militarily, and to torment and spur on to
revolt the long-suffering masses of the people, of whom this criminal and
shameful war is demanding such endless sacrifices. Autocratic Russia has already
been defeated by constitutional Japan, and dragging on the war will only
increase and aggravate the defeat. The best part of the Russian navy has been
destroyed; the position of Port Arthur is hopeless, and the naval squadron sent
to its relief has not the slightest chance of even reaching its destination,
let alone of achieving success; the main army under Kuropatkin has lost over
200,000 men and stands exhausted and helpless before the, enemy, who is bound to
crush it after the capture of Port Arthur. Military disaster is inevitable, and
together with it discontent, unrest, and indignation will inevitably increase
tenfold.


We must prepare for that moment with the utmost energy. At that moment, one of
the outbreaks which are recurring, now here, now there, with such growing
frequency, will develop into a tremendous popular movement. At that moment the
proletariat will rise and take its stand at the head of the insurrection to win
freedom for the entire people and to secure for the working class the
possibility of waging the open and broad struggle for socialism, a struggle
enriched by the whole experience of Europe.

Lenin’s article âThe Autocracy and the Proletariatâ was
    published as an editorial in issue No. I of the newspaper Vperyod.


Vperyod (Forward) was an underground Bolshevik weekly published in Geneva
from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1903), to May 5 (18), 1905. Eighteen numbers
were issued. The newspaper’s organiser, manager, and guiding spirit was
V. I. Lenin. Other members of the Editorial Board were V. V. Vorovsky,
M. S. Olminsky, and A. V. Lunacharsky.


The outstanding role which the newspaper played in combating Menshevism,
re-establishing the Party principle, and formulating and elucidating the issues
posed by the rising revolution was acknowledged in a special resolution of the
Third Party Congress, which recorded a vote of thanks to the Editorial Board.


Over forty articles and minor items by Lenin were published in Vperyod.
Some issues of the newspaper, e.g., Nos. 4 and 5, which dealt with the events of
January 9 (22), 1905, were written almost entirely by Lenin.


Vperyod maintained regular contacts with the Party organisations in
Russia. Especially close connections existed with the St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Odessa, Baku, Ekaterinoslav, and other Party committees, as well as with the
Caucasian League Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., which formed a special publicists’
group to assist Lenin’s paper.


Lenin’s articles in Vperyod were often reprinted in the local
Bolshevik press and published in the form of leaflets and pamphlets.





[3]

Zemstvo—the name given to the local government bodies formed
in the central provinces of tsarist Russia in 1864. They were dominated by the
nobility and their powers were limited to purely local economic problems
(hospital and road building, statistics, insurance, etc.). Their activities
were controlled by the Provincial Governors and by the Ministry of the
Interior, which could rescind any decisions of which the government
disapproved.





[4]

Municipal councillors—members of municipal councils in tsarist
 Russia.





[5]

The reference is to the tsar’s ukase of December 12 (25), 1904, to
 the Senate.





[6]

Zemstvo councillors—members of Zemstvo assemblies in tsarist
 Russia.





[7]

 The reference is to the tsarist government’s brief flirtation with the
      liberals in 1904. Svyatopolk-Mirsky, the Minister of the Interior,
      sanctioned the Zemstvo meetings, slightly relaxed the censorship, pardoned
      several banished liberal politicians, etc.





[8]

Plehve, V. K.—a statesman in tsarist Russia; between 1902 and
1904 Minister of the Interior and Chief of the Gendarmes. He waged
a bitter fight against the revolutionary movement.





[9]

Osvobozhdeniye liberals—bourgeois liberals grouped round
the magazine Osvobozhdeniye (Emancipation), which was published abroad
in 1902-05 under the editorship of P.B. Struve. The Osvobozhdeniye
liberals organised the liberal-monarchist Osoobozhdeniye League in
January 1904. Later they formed the nucleus of the
 principal bourgeois party in Russia—the
 Constitutional-Democratic Party (Cadets).





[10]

Socialists-Revolutionaries (S. R. ’s)— a petty-bourgeois party in
Russia, which arose at the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 as a result of
the union of the Narodnik groups and circles. The news paper Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia) (1900-05) and the magazine
Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii (Herald of the Russian Revolution) (1901-05)
became its official organs. The views of the S.R.’s were an eclectic mixture of
the ideas of Narodism and revisionism; they tried, as Lenin put it, to patch up
âthe rents in the Narodnik ideasâ with âbits of fashionable
opportunist ’criticism’ of Marxismâ. (See present edition, Vol. 9,
âSocialism and the Peasantryâ, p. 310.) The S.R.’s failed to see
the class distinctions between proletariat and peasantry, glossed over the class
differentiation and contradictions within the peasantry, and rejected the
proletariat’s leading role in the revolution. The tactics of individual
terrorism which the S.R.’s advocated as a basic method of struggle against the
autocracy caused great harm to the revolutionary-movement and made it difficult
to organise the masses for revolutionary struggle.


The agrarian programme of the SR.’s envisaged the abolition of private ownership
of the land and its transfer to the village communes on the basis of equalised
tenure, as well as the development of all forms of co-operation. There was
nothing socialistic in this programme, which the SR.’s sought to present as a
programme for âsocialising the landâ, since abolition of private
ownership of the land alone, as Lenin pointed out, cannot abolish the domination
of capital and the poverty of the masses. The real, historically progressive
content of the S.R. agrarian programme was the struggle for the abolition of
landlord ownership, for the âAmericanâ way of capitalist development
in Russian agriculture. This programme objectively expressed the interests and
aspirations of the peasantry at the stage of the bourgeois-democratic
revolution.


The Bolshevik Party fought hard against the attempts of the SR.’s to camouflage
themselves as socialists and to spread their influence to the working class,
against their tactics of individual terrorism; the S.R. ’s were the chief
opponents of the Bolsheviks, who struggled

   

 to gain influence over the peasantry and to strengthen the alliance
between the working class and the peasantry. At the-same time, on definite
conditions, the Bolsheviks concluded temporary agreements with the SR.’s in the
struggle against tsarism.


In the final analysis, the absence of class homogeneousness in the peasantry was
responsible for the political and ideological instability and the
organisational confusion in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and for its
constant vacillation between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat. There
had been a split in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party during the first Russian
revolution, its Right Wing forming the legal Toilers’ Popular-Socialist Party,
which held views close to those of the Constitutional-Democrats and the
âLeftâ Wing taking shape as the semi-anarchist league of
âMaximalistsâ. During the Stolypin reaction, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party experienced a complete ideological and organisational break-down,
and the First World War saw most SR.’s adopt the standpoint of
social-chauvinism.


After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic revolution in 1917, the
SR.’s, together with the Mensheviks and Constitutional-Democrats, were the
mainstay of the counter-revolutionary bourgeois-landlord Provisional
Government, in which leaders of the party (Kerensky, Avksentyev, Chernov)
participated. Influenced by the revolutionising of the peasantry, the
âLeftâ Wing of the S.R. s founded an independent party of Left
S.R.’s at the end of November 1917. Striving to maintain their influence among
the peasant masses, the Left S.R.’s formally recognised the Soviet power and
entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but with the development of the
class struggle in the villages they turned against the Soviet power. During the
foreign military intervention and the Civil War, the SR.’s carried on counter-revolutionary subversive activity, strongly
supported the interventionists and whiteguard generals, took part in
counter-revolutionary plots, and organised terrorist acts against leaders of the
Soviet state. After the Civil War, the S.R.’s continued their hostile activity
against the Soviet state within the country and abroad among whiteguard
émigrés.

Nasha Zhizn (Our Life)—a newspaper close to the Left Wing of the
Constitutional-Democrats, published in St. Petersburg between
1904 and 1905.





[12]

Lenin applies the word âsecretâ ironically to the congress of
chair men of Zemstvo Boards and other Zemstvo officials which was due to be held
on November 6, 1904, in St. Petersburg by permission of the tsar. Five days
before the opening, when the delegates had

be gun 

to arrive, it was announced
that the tsarist government had proposed the postponement of the congress for a
year. ·However, Minister of the Interior Svyatopolk-Mirsky, who was
flirting with the liberals, allowed the Zemstvo delegates to have a chat
âover a cup of tea in private apartmentsâ.





[13]

The famous Rostov strike broke out on November 2 (15),
    1902. It quickly developed into a political demonstration in which up to
    thirty thousand workers took part. The strike lasted until November 25
    (December 8). It was led by the Iskrist Don Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. (See
    present edition, Vol. 6, âNew Events and Old Questionsâ,
    pp. 278-83.)


The number of mass demonstrations in the South mentioned by Lenin
refers to the mass political strikes and demonstrations which took place in the
South of Russia in 1903, involving the Transcan casus (Baku, Tiflis, and Batum)
and the chief Ukrainian cities (Odessa, Kiev, and Ekaterinoslav).

The present-day constitutional movement among the propertied classes in our
country differs sharply from former movements of the same type at the end of
the fifties and seventies. The constitutional demands of the liberals are
essentially the same. The speeches of the radical orators reiterate the
familiar propositions of Zemstvo liberalism. The proletariat’s participation in
the movement provides a significant and very important new factor. The Russian
working class, whose movement was the pivot of the entire revolutionary movement
of the past decade, has long since reached the stage of open struggle, of street
demonstrations, of popular mass meetings in defiance of the police, and of
head-on clashes with the enemy in the streets of the southern cities.


And the liberal-bourgeois movement is at this moment marked by the bold,
determined, incomparably sharper and more daring entry of the proletariat upon
the scene. We would mention, first, the demonstration in St. Petersburg, in
which the workers’ participation was unfortunately weak, owing to the
disorganising activity of the âMensheviksâ, and the demonstration
in Moscow. Next we would mention the presence of workers at a liberal-bourgeois
banquet in Smolensk; at a meeting of the Educational Society in Nizhni-Novgorod;
and at conferences of scientific, medical, and other societies in various
cities. Further, there were the large meeting of workers in Saratov, the
demonstration of November 6 in the Kharkov Law Society, that of November 20 in
the Ekaterinodar Municipal Council, that of November 18 in the Odessa Health
Protection Society, and, again in Odessa, somewhat later, in the Regional Law
Court. We would add that both demonstrations

    

 in Odessa and the one in Kharkov were accompanied by street demonstrations
      of workers, by processions with banners through the streets, by the
      singing of revolutionary songs, and so forth.


The last four demonstrations are described, incidentally, in Iskra,
No. 79,[1]

under the heading âProletarian Demonstrationsâ, to which
descriptions I should like to draw the reader’s attention. First, I shall
indicate the facts according to Iskra, following which I shall give
Iskra’s comments.


Kharkov. The Committee organises the participation of workers in a meeting of
the Law Society. Over two hundred workers are present; some of the workers felt
embarrassed about attending such an august assembly, while others could not
enter because âmuzhiks were not admittedâ. The liberal chairman
takes to his heels after the first revolutionary speech. Then follows the
speech of a Social-Democrat, leaflets are tossed into the air, the
Marseillaise is sung, and the participants pour out into the street,
and together with a crowd of close on 500 workers march along with a red flag,
singing labour songs. Towards the end some are beaten up and arrested.


Ekaterinodar. A large crowd flocks to the hall of the municipal council
(attracted by rumours of liberals’ speeches to be delivered there). The
telephone is cut off. A speaker from the committee makes his way into the hall
with 30 or 40 workers and delivers a short, fully revolutionary
Social-Democratic speech. Applause. Leaflets. consternation among the councillors. The Mayor protests unavailingly. At the conclusion, the demonstrators
leave the hall calmly. That night—numerous house searches by the police.


Odessa. First demonstration. A meeting attended by about two thousand people,
the mass of them workers. A number of revolutionary speeches
(Social-Democratic and Socialist-Revolutionary), thunderous applause,
revolutionary outcries, leaflets. Marching through the streets with
revolutionary songs. Dispersing without a clash.


Odessa. Second demonstration. A gathering of several thousand. A similarly vast
revolutionary public rally and march through the streets as in the previous
demonstration. A clash. Many hurt, some seriously. One woman worker dies. Sixty
arrests.

 

Such are the facts of the case. Such are the demonstrations of the Russian
proletarians.


Now, as to the line of reasoning of certain Social-Democratic intellectuals. It
relates to the demonstration in Ekaterinodar, to which an entire article has
been devoted. Read attentively: âIn this demonstration for the first time
the organised Russian proletariat came face to face with our liberal-minded
bourgeoisie!â... The demonstration âis a further step in the development
of forms of political struggleâ; it is, âwhen all is said and done,
a really new method of political struggle which yields very evident fruitful
resultsâ; the workers in such demonstrations âfeel that they are
acting as definite political unitsâ, they acquire âa sense of
competence to act as the political fighters of the partyâ. We see
spreading âin the broadest social circles the idea of the party as of some
thing quite definite, something that has taken shape, and, what is most
important, something that has the right to put forth demandsâ.
People are beginning to look upon the whole party âas an active, fighting
political force which states its demands clearly and definitelyâ. It is
necessary âto make wider use of the new method of struggle—in the
councils, in the Zemstvos, and at every kind of assembly of public
figuresâ. And the editors of Iskra, in unison with the author of
these views, speak of âthe idea of demonstrations of a new typeâ, of
the fact that âin Ekaterinodar in particular our comrades were able to
show ’society’ that they were acting as an independent party which feels capable
of influencing the course of events and endeavours to do soâ.


Well, well. âIn Ekaterinodar in particular.â ... A new step, a new method,
a new practice, face to face for the first time, very evident fruitful results,
definite political units, a sense of political competence, the right to put
forth demands.... To me these pompous attempts at profound reasoning smacked of
something stale, passé, and almost forgotten. But be fore accounting to
myself how I sensed the staleness, I involuntarily asked: Pardon me, gentlemen,
but why âin Ekaterinodar in particularâ? Why indeed is it a new method?
Why is it that the Kharkov and Odessa comrades do not brag (excuse the vulgar
expression) about the newness of the method and the evident fruitful results,
about meeting face to face for the first time, and a sense of political
competence?

    

Why are the results of a meeting of a few dozen workers together with several
      hundred liberals within the four walls of a council hall more evident and
      fruitful than the meetings of thousands of workers, not only in medical
      and law societies, but in the streets? Can it really be that
    street meetings (in Odessa, as well as those previously held in
    Rostov-on-Don and other cities) are less likely to develop a sense of
    political competence and the right to put forth demands then meetings in
    municipal councils?... True, I must admit that I feel rather uncomfortable
    in quoting this last expression (the right to put forth
      demands); it is so stupid. But you can’t throw the words out of a
    song.


In one instance, however, this expression acquires some meaning, and not only
this expression, but Iskra’s entire line of reasoning, namely, if we
presume the existence of parliamentarism, if we visualise for a moment that the
Ekaterinodar Municipal Council has been transplanted to the banks of the
Thames, next to Westminster Abbey. On this slight assumption it becomes clear
why, within the four walls of a delegates’ meeting hall one can have more
âright to put forth demandsâ than in the streets; why struggle
against a Prime Minister, that is, the Mayor of Ekaterinodar, is more fruitful
than struggle against a policeman; why the sense of political competence and the
knowledge of oneself as a definite political unit is heightened precisely in
the hall of a parliament or in the hall of a Zemstvo Assembly. Indeed, why not
play at parliamentarism for lack of a real parliament? One can obtain here such
a vivid mental picture of âa meeting face to faceâ, of âa new
methodâ, and all the rest of it. True, these mental pictures will
inevitably divert our thoughts from the issues of a real mass struggle
for parliamentarism, instead of playing at parliamentarism; that,
however, is a trifle. But then what evident, tangible results....


Tangible results.... The expression immediately reminds me of Comrade Martynov
and Rabocheye Dyelo.[2]

Without reverting to the latter it is
impossible to appraise the new Iskra correctly. The arguments about
âa new method of struggleâ in connection with the Ekaterinodar
demonstration are a repetition of the arguments used by the editors in their
âLetter to Party Organisationsâ (incidentally, is it wise to keep
the original a secret, stacked away, and to circulate

    

only a copy openly for general information?). The editors’ arguments follow
Rabocheye Dyelo’s usual trend of thought, but in another connection.


Wherein lay the error and the harmfulness of the Rabocheye Dyelo
âtheoryâ of imparting a political character to the economic
struggle itself, the âtheoryâ of the economic struggle of the
workers against the employers and the government, of the need to present to the
government concrete demands which promise certain tangible results? Should we
not impart a political character to the economic struggle? We certainly
should. But when Rabocheye Dyelo deduced the political aims of a
revolutionary party of the proletariat from the âeconomicâ
(trade-unionist) struggle, it unjustifiably narrowed and vulgarised the
Social-Democratic conception, it detracted from the tasks of the proletariat’s
all-round political struggle.


Wherein lie the error and the harmfulness of the new Iskra’s theory
of a new method, of a higher type of mobilisation of the proletarian forces, of
a new way of developing the sense of political competence among the workers,
their âright to put forth demandsâ, and so on, and so forth? Should
we not organise workers’ demonstrations both in the Zemstvo Assemblies and on
the occasion of these assemblies? We certainly should. But in speaking of good
proletarian demonstrations we should not talk highbrow nonsense. We shall only
demoralise the class-consciousness of the proletariat, we shall only divert the
proletariat from the tasks, increasingly pressing, of the real, serious, open
struggle, if we extol as a new method those very features of our ordinary
demonstrations which least resemble active struggle and which it would be
ludicrous to declare as productive of excellent results or as heightening the
sense of political competence, etc.


Both our old acquaintance, Comrade Martynov, and the new Iskra are
guilty of the sin peculiar to the intelligentsia— lack of faith in the
strength of the proletariat; in its ability to organise, in general, and to
create a party organisation, in particular; in its ability to conduct the
political struggle. Rabocheye Dyelo believed that the proletariat was
still incapable, and would be incapable for a long time to come, of conducting
the political struggle that goes beyond the limits of the economic struggle
against the employers and the government.

    

The new Iskra believes that the proletariat is still
    incapable, and will be incapable for a long time to come, of independent
    revolutionary action, and so it calls a demonstration of a few dozen workers
    before the Zemstvo people a new method of struggle. Both the old
    Rabocheye Dyelo and the new Iskra religiously repeat the
    phrases about the independent activity and self-education of the proletariat only because this religious fervour screens the intellectualist
    incomprehension of the real forces of the proletariat and of the urgent
    tasks that confront it. Both the old Rabocheye Dyelo and the new
    Iskra talk absolute nonsense with an air of profundity about the
    special significance of tangible and evident results, and about a concrete
    contraposition of bourgeoisie and proletariat, thereby diverting the
    attention of the proletariat from the increasingly pressing task of a direct
    onset upon the autocracy, at the head of a popular uprising, towards playing
    at parliamentarism. In undertaking to revise the old organisational
    and tactical principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy and fussily
    searching for new formulas and ânew methodsâ, both the old
    Rabocheye Dyelo and the new Iskra are in fact dragging the
    Party back, proposing superseded, at times even downright reactionary,
    slogans.


We have had enough of this new revision that leads to the old rubbish! It is
time to go forward and stop covering up disorganisation with the notorious
organisation-as-process theory; it is time, in workers’ demonstrations, to
accentuate and advance to the foreground those features that tend to bring them
closer to the real, open struggle for freedom.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]

Iskra (The Spark) was the first all-Russian
underground Marxist newspaper; it was founded by Lenin in 1900.


Iskra became the centre for the unification of Party forces, for the
rallying and training of Party workers. It played a decisive role in the
struggle for a Marxist party, in the defeat of the âEconomistsâ,
and in the unification of the scattered Social-Democratic circles.


On the initiative and with the direct participation of Lenin, the Iskra
Editorial Board drew up a draft programme of the Party and prepared the Second
Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., held in July-August 1903. After the Second Congress
the Mensheviks, with the aid of Plekhanov, seized control of Iskra.
Beginning with November 1903 (with issue No. 52), Iskra became the
organ of the Mensheviks and was published up to October 1905. Since then Lenin’s
Iskra be came known as the old Iskra and the Menshevik
opportunist organ as the new Iskra. The reference here is to the new,
Menshevik Iskra.





[2]

Rabocheye Dyelo (The Workers’
Cause)—publication of the âEconomistsâ, appeared irregularly
in Geneva between April 1899 and February 1902 as organ of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad. It was edited by B. N. Krichevsky, P.F. Teplov
(Sibiryak), and V.P. Ivanshin and subsequently by A. S. Martynov. Twelve
numbers appeared (in nine issues).

Tile 

Editorial Board was the centre abroad of
the âEconomistsâ (Rabocheye Dyelo-ists). Rabocheye Dyelo
supported the Bernsteinian slogan of âfreedom to criticiseâ Marxism
and took an opportunist stand on the questions of the tactics and organisational
tasks of Russian Social-Democracy; it rejected the revolutionary potentialities
of the peasantry, etc. The Rabocheye Dyelo-ists propagated opportunist
ideas of the subordination of the political struggle to the economic struggle;
they bowed to the spontaneity of the labour movement and denied the leading role
of the Party. At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the Rabocheye
Dyelo-ists represented the extreme Right, opportunist, Wing of the
Party. A critique of the views of the Rabocheye Dyelo group is to be
found in Lenin’s work What Is To Be Done? (See present edition,
Vol. 5, pp. 347-529.)

All eyewitnesses agree that the demonstration of November 28 was a failure
because of the almost complete absence of workers. But why did the workers keep
away from the demonstration? Why did the St. Petersburg Committee, in response
to whose call the student youth had come to the demonstration, fail to take
steps to secure the attendance of the workers, thus defeating its own
enterprise? The answer to these questions is given in the following letter from
a worker, a member of the Committee, from which we print the most important
passages:



âFeeling (at the beginning of November) was running high and seeking an
outlet. This outlet was to be provided by a demonstration, and in fact a leaflet
did appear at that time, issued in the name of the Students’ Social-Democratic
Organisation and calling for a demonstration on November 14. On learning of
this, the Committee proposed to the organisation that the demonstration be
postponed until the end of November, to permit joint participation with the
St. Petersburg proletariat. The students agreed.... The class-conscious workers
were very edger to have a demonstration. Many workers came to Nevsky Prospekt on
November 14 under the impression that the students’ demonstration would take
place. When they were told that they should not have come without a call by the
Committee, they conceded the point, but said that they ’thought there would be
something doing there anyway’. At any rate, this fact illustrates the mood of
the class-conscious workers.


âAt a meeting of the Committee on November 18 it was decided to hold the
demonstration on the 28th. A subcommittee was immediately set up to organise the
demonstration and work out a plan of action; it was decided to issue two
preparatory agitational leaflets and a call. We threw ourselves into the job
with all energy. The writer of these lines personally arranged several meetings
of workers, study circle members, at which we discussed the role of the working
class and the aim and significance of a demonstration at the present moment. We
discussed the question of an armed or an unarmed demonstration, and all these
meetings adopted resolutions supporting the decision of the Committee. The
workers demanded as many leaflets as possible for distribution, ’Give us
wagon-loads,’ they said.

 

   âAnd so, a demonstration, which promised to be really impressive,
   was being prepared for the 28th. But here our St. Petersburg ’Minority’,
   like the ’All-Russian’ ’Minority’ and the ’Minority’ abroad, could not help
   playing a purely negative role, the role of a disorganiser. To make that
   role perfectly clear, I shall have to say a few words about the local
   ’Minority’ and its activities. Before the demonstration, and after the
   Committee consisted largely of adherents of the Majority of the Second
   Party

      Congress.[1]

   Arrests and the differences that are tearing the Party asunder have in many
   ways weakened the activity of the local Social-Democratic
   organisations. In its fight against the ’Majority’ the local
   ’Minority’ tries, for its own factional purposes, to discredit our
   local Committee. District representatives who adhere to the
   ’Minority’ do not admit comrades of the ’Majority’ into their
   districts and do not supply the Committee with ally contacts. The
   result is terrible disorganisation and lowered efficiency in the
   districts concerned. The following is a case in point. For the last
   five or six months the representative of one district has been a
   ’Menshevik’. Due to the fact that it has been out of touch with the
   general activity, this district has lost ground terribly. Where there
   were formerly from fifteen to twenty study circles, there are now
   barely from four to five. The workers are dissatisfied with this
   state of affairs, and their representative is seeking to exploit this
   dissatisfaction against the ’Majority’ by setting the workers against
   the Committee. The ’Minority seeks to turn every weakness in the
   local Social-Democratic organisation to account against the
   ’Majority’. Whether its attempts are successful or not is another
   matter, but the fact remains that this is so.  

   âThree days before the demonstration, the Committee was called
   together on the initiative of the ’Minority’. For certain reasons three
   members of the ’Majority’ on the Committee could not be notified in advance
   and were absent. The ’Minority’ made a motion to call off the
   demonstration, threatening, otherwise, to work against it and not
   distribute a single leaflet. Owing to the absence of the three comrades
   that would have supported the demonstration, the motion was carried. It was
   decided not to distribute any leaflets and to destroy those containing the
   call.  

   âThe broad mass of the general public, as well as the workers,
   prepared to attend the demonstration and waited only for the Committee’s
   call. Rumours began to circulate that the demonstration had been called off
   and indefinitely postponed. Many strongly objected to the cancellation; the
   technical workers[3]

   protested and refused to work for the Committee in the future.  

   âA meeting of the Committee was called on Friday, and the three
   members who had been absent at the previous meeting protested against the
   improper revision of the decision to hold the demonstration.

    

   Since a mass of people would gather in Nevsky Prospekt anyway, even if no
   leaflets were distributed, they urged that all steps be taken to get the
   workers as well to participate in the demonstration. A representative of
   the ’Minority’ objected on the grounds that ’not all workers are
   sufficiently developed to participate consciously in the demonstration and
   to be able to defend the demands put forward by the Committee’. The
   question was put to the vote; the meeting decided, with only one opposing
   vote, to hold the demonstration. But it transpired that many of the printed
   leaflets—over 12,000—containing the call had been burnt. Besides, their
   mass distribution at the factories was impossible, since they could not be
   delivered anywhere by Saturday morning, and on Saturdays the factories stop
   work at two or three o’clock. Thus, the leaflets could be distributed only
   among a small circle of workers, among acquaintances, but not among the
   broad masses. Under the circumstances the demonstration was foredoomed to
   failure. And fail it did....  

   âNow our ’Minority’ can rejoice. It has won! Here is a new fact
   that discredits the Committee (read: the ’Majority’). But we hope that the
   reader will consider more seriously the reasons why the demonstration
   turned out as it did, and will say with us: ’Yes, as things now are in the
   Party it is impossible to work with any success. We must put an end to the
   crisis within the Party as soon as possible, we must close our ranks,
   otherwise we are in danger of complete enfeeblement and, unless we take
   advantage of the present favourable moment, we shall find ourselves
   trailing at the tail—end of great events.â  


This disruptive act of the St. Petersburg âMinorityâ, which, in their
own petty factional interests, prevented a proletarian demonstration, is
the last drop that should make the cup of the Party’s patience run
over. That our Party is seriously ill and has lost a good half of its
influence during the past year is known to the whole world. We appeal now
to those who are incapable of regarding this serious ailment with sneers or
malicious joy, who cannot dismiss the accursed questions of the Party
crisis with mere sighs and shakes of the head, with snivelling and whining,
who consider it their duty, even at the cost of a supreme effort, to
achieve full clarity on the causes of the crisis—to fulfil that duty and
pluck up the evil by its roots. For these people, and these people
only, we shall recapitulate the history of the crisis; for with out
studying this history it is impossible to understand the present split,
which the âMensheviksâ have finally contrived to bring about.  

First stage of the crisis: At the Second Congress of our Party the principles of
the Iskra position win, despite the opposition of the Rabocheye
Dyelo and semi-Rabocheye Dyelo
    

people. After the Congress, the Minority begins to tear the Party asunder over
      the question of bringing into the Editorial Board persons whom the
      Congress rejected. Disorganisation, boycott, and preparation for a split
      go on for three months, from the end of August to the end of
    November.


Second stage: Plekhanov yields to the gentlemen who yearn for co-optation and
makes manifest to all in public print, in the article âWhat Should Not Be
Doneâ (No. 52), that he is offering a personal concession to the
revisionists and anarchists-individualists in order to avert a greater
evil. The gentlemen take advantage of this concession to go on rending the
Party. Having taken their seats on the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and
on the Council of the Party, they form a secret organisation for the
purpose of getting their people into the Central Committee and obstructing the
Third Congress. Unheard-of and incredible though it may be, this fact is proved
by documentary evidence in the form of a letter of the new Central Committee
concerning deals made with this worthy crew.


Third stage: Three members of the Central Committee side with the conspirators
against the Party. They co-opt three pretenders from the Minority
(assuring the committees, in writing, of the contrary), and, with the aid of the
Council, decidedly obstruct the Third Congress, which was favoured by
the overwhelming majority of the committees that voiced their opinions on the
crisis. In Orlovsky’s[4]

 pamphlet (The Council Against the Party) and
in Lenin’s (Statement and Documents on the Break of the Central Institutions
with the

      Party[2]

),

these facts are likewise proved by documentary evidence. The mass of the Party workers in Russia are unaware of these facts, but
they should be known to everyone who wishes to be a Party member in more than
name.


Fourth stage: The Party workers in Russia unite for action against the group
abroad which has disgraced our Party. The adherents and the Committees of
the Majority arrange several private conferences and elect
representatives. The new Central Committee, which is controlled completely by
the co-opted pretenders, makes it its business to disorganise
    

and split all local committees of the Majority. The comrades should not
entertain any illusions on this score; the Central Committee has no other
purpose. The creatures of the clique abroad are preparing and forming new
committees everywhere (in Odessa, Baku, Ekaterinoslav, Moscow, Voronezh,
etc.). The group abroad is preparing its own, hand-picked congress. The secret
organisation, having finished with the central bodies, has turned against the
local committees.


The disruptive trick of the St. Petersburg Mensheviks is no accident; it is a
calculated step towards splitting the Committee, a move made with the help of
the âMensheviksâ co-opted into the Central Committee. We repeat: The
Party workers in Russia in their majority are unaware of these facts. We warn
them and say to them most emphatically that everyone who wishes to struggle for
the Party and against disorganisation, everyone who does not want to be utterly
duped, must know all these facts.


We have made all possible concessions and several quite impossible ones in order
to continue working in one party with the âMinorityâ. Now that the
Third Congress has been obstructed and the disruptive tactics have been directed
against the local committees, all hope of achieving this is lost. Unlike the
âMensheviksâ, who work by underhand means, behind the Party’s back,
we must declare openly and prove by deeds that the Party has broken off any and
all relations with these gentry.

Three conferences of local committees of our Party have recently been held: (1)
the conference of the four Caucasian committees, (2) the conference of the
three southern committees (Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, and Nikolayev), and (3) the
conference of the six northern committees (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, Riga,
the North, and Nizhni-Novgorod). We hope shortly to be able to give detailed
information about these conferences.[2]

For the time being we can report
that all three conferences emphatically went on record for the immediate
convocation of the Third Congress of the Party and in support of the publicists’
group of the âMajorityâ.

Bolshevik (Majority) organisational centre—the Bureau
of Committees of the Majority—was elected at the conferences of the local
Majority committees. The southern conference was held in September 1904. The
Majority conference of the Caucasian committees was held in Tiflis in November
1904; it was attended by 15 delegates representing the Baku, Batum,

Imeret.ian-Mingrelian 

and Tiflis committees. The northern conference was held in
December 1904.





[2]

The resolutions of the northern conference were published by Lenin in 1905 in
Vperyod, No. 2, for January 14 (1), in the Party News column.


The resolutions of the southern conference were first published in 1930 in
Lenin

   Miscellany
XV, pp. 217-19. The resolutions of the Caucasian
conference were published in the same volume,
 pp. 249-53.

Under the above headline, the Frankfurter Zeitung, mouthpiece of the
big German stockjobbers, gives the following interesting report:


“Rumours of a new big Russian loan have been current for several weeks
now. All these rumours were promptly denied. It is now officially admitted,
however, that a loan was recently [reported on December 29, new style]
negotiated in St. Petersburg. No doubt, these official negotiations were preceded by private inquiries, which gave rise to the rumours. It is reported that
German financiers took part this time in the negotiations. The loan is to be
floated on the German market. Until now, since the beginning of the war, Russia
has raised funds in three different ways: first, about 300 million rubles was
borrowed from the cash holdings of the Treasury, in creased by cuts in previous
allocations. This was followed by a loan of 800 million francs (about 300
million rubles) obtained through French bankers. In August Russia floated a
domes tic loan of 150 million rubles. The war is consuming heavy sums which are
growing from month to month, and Russia is again planning to raise a big foreign
loan. Russian stocks have recently shown a strong (serious,
bedenkliche) downward trend. How the German public will react to the
Russian loan is unpredictable. The fortunes of war, so far, have invariably
favoured the Japanese. And whereas, so far, Russian loans have been considered a
safe investment, they are now becoming more or less speculative
(Beigeschmack), especially in view of the tsar’s recent Manifesto,
which throws characteristic light on what is going on in Russia. It remains to
be seen whether the new loan will be offered to the German public on terms (the
interest rate and the price of issue) that would make up for the impaired
quality of the Russian loan."— — —

 

Another warning to the Russian autocracy by the European bourgeoisie! It is
      losing credit as a result both of the military defeats and of the growing
      discontent within the country. The European bankers are beginning to
      regard the autocracy as a gambling speculation, while the
      “quality” of Russian loans, in the sense of their reliability,
      is frankly declared to be impaired.


And what a mass of money this criminal war, which must be consuming no less than
three million rubles a day, is still going to cost the people!

January 10, 1905


My dear friend,


At last we have launched Vperyod, and I would like to discuss it with
you in greater detail. Issue No. 2 will appear the day after tomorrow. We intend
to bring it out weekly. We have sufficient literary forces for the task. We are
all in excellent spirits and at the top of our working form (with the slight
exception of Vasily Vasilyevich,[2]

who has a touch of the blues). We are sure
that things will go well, so long as we don’t go bankrupt. We need 400 francs
(150 rubles) per issue, but we have only 1,200 francs all in all. We shall need
the deuce of a lot of help for the first few months; for, unless we can make it
a regular publication, the entire position of the Majority will be dealt a
terrific, well-nigh irreparable blow. Do not forget this and get whatever you
can

(e s p e c i a l l y   f r o m   G o r k y).


Next. It is particularly important now to let Rakhmetov[3]

know that
he should push on as hard as he can with the arrangements for literary
contributions from Russia. The success of a weekly depends largely upon the
energetic collaboration of Russian writers and Social-Democrats. Write to
Rakhmetov that he should mobilise both Finn and Kollontai for the purpose
(we badly need articles

o n   F i n l a n d),

as well as
Rumyantsev and Andrei Sokolov, the latter especially and particularly. I know by long
experience that the people in Russia are devilishly, unpardonably, and
incredibly slow at this sort of thing. It is therefore necessary to act, first
of all, by personal example; secondly, not to rely on promises, but to see that
you get the things written. Let Rakhmetov be sure to order the articles and the
correspondence himself, and receive them himself, and send them off himself,
keeping at it until

    

he gets the material. (I would also add

   S u v o r o v   a n d   L u n t s,

but I
    am sure Rakhmetov knows many others besides.) We badly need: (1) articles on
    questions of Russian life, from 6,000 to 18,000 letters; (2) paragraphs on
    the same subjects, from 2,000 to 6,000 letters; (3) correspondence of
    diverse length about everything; (4) interesting passages and quotations
    from local Russian and special Russian publications; (5) paragraphs on
    articles in Russian newspapers and magazines. The last three points are
    quite within the range of contribution by working-class and especially the
    student youth, and therefore the thing should be given attention; this work
    should be popularised, people should be roused and filled with zeal; they
    should, by concrete example, be taught what is wanted and how necessary it
    is to utilise every trifle; they should be made to see how badly needed the
    raw material from Russia is abroad (we shall be able to work it up
    from a literary angle and make use of it ourselves), that it is foolish in
    the extreme to feel embarrassed about literary shortcomings, that they must
    learn to speak simply and correspond simply with the periodical abroad if
    they wish to make it their own journal. In view of this I would consider it
    simply necessary and positively essential to hand out a Vperyod
    address (a foreign address, of which we have many now and shall have more)
    to every student circle and to every workers’ group. I
    assure you that there is an idiotic prejudice among our committee-men
    against handing out addresses on a broad scale to the periphery
    youth. Combat this prejudice with all your might, hand out the addresses,
    and demand direct contact with the Editorial Board of

    Vpe.ryod. 

Unless this is done there will be no newspaper. Workers’
    correspondence is very badly needed, and there is so little of it. What we
    need is scores and hundreds of workers corresponding directly with
    Vperyod.


We must also get the workers to communicate their own addresses to which
Vperyod may be mailed in closed envelopes. The workers will not be
afraid. The police will not be able to intercept a tenth of the envelopes. The
small (four-page) size and frequent appearance of Vperyod make the
question of envelope delivery a most vital one for our newspaper. We should make
it our direct objective to develop workers’ subscriptions to Vperyod,
to develop the habit of sending the

    

money (a ruble isn’t something God knows what!) and one’s address abroad. If we
tackle this properly, my word, we could revolutionise the distribution of
underground literature in Russia. Don’t forget that transportation, at best,
takes four months. And that’s with a weekly paper! As for the enveloped
copies. probably from 50 to 75 per cent will be delivered at postal speed.


Now, as to the writers. They ought simply to be obligated to write regularly
once a week or once a fortnight; otherwise— so, indeed, tell

them—-we 

 cannot consider them decent people and will have nothing more to
do with them. The usual excuse is: We don’t know what theme to choose, we’re
afraid to waste our effort, we think âthey already have thisâ. It is
against these trite and idiotic pretexts that Rakhmetov must wage a personal, a
definitely personal, fight. The principal themes are the domestic topics of
Russia (of the kind that comprise in periodical literature reviews of the
domestic political scene and reflections of social life), as well as articles
and brief comments on material appearing in Russian special publications
(statistical, military, medical, prison, ecclesiastical, and other
periodicals). We are always in need of copy for these two sections. Only people
living in Russia, and such people alone, can conduct these two sections
well. The keynote here is fresh facts, fresh impressions, special materials
that are inaccessible to the people abroad, and not just arguments, not
evaluations from the Social-Democratic point of view. Therefore, such
articles and comments will never go to waste, for we shall always make use of
them. It is Rakhmetov’s duty now to organise this thing at once and give us at
least half a dozen good, useful contributors, who would not be lazy or try to
shirk their jobs, but would each get in direct touch with the Editorial
Board. Only by direct contact with contributors can we arrange all the details
of the work. People should be enlisted by being made to realise that nowhere
else can they âget into printâ as quickly as in a weekly newspaper.


In conclusion, a word or two about the organisational slogan of today. After
the article âTime to Call a Halt!â (Vperyod, No.

 1),[1]

this slogan should be clear; but people are so

    

inert that Rakhmetov, here again, will have to explain and explain again, and
      hammer it into their heads as hard as he can. The split is now
    complete; for we have exhausted all means. It is the Third
      Congress against the will of the Central Committee and the Council
    and without them. Complete rupture with the Central Committee. An
    open statement that we have our own Bureau. The complete removal of the
    Mensheviks and the new-Iskrists everywhere. We did everything we could to
    get on together, and should now declare openly and bluntly that we are
    obliged to work separately. All trustfulness and

    naivet6 

can only cause
    tremendous harm.


For Christ’s sake hurry up and issue an open and emphatic statement on
the Bureau.[4]

It is necessary: (1) to line up fully with âTime to
Call a Halt!â and re-issue its appeal; (2) to declare that Vperyod is
the organ of the majority of the committees and that the Bureau is working with
it in complete and friendly agreement; (3) that the C.C. and the Council have
deceived the Party in the most disgraceful way and sabotaged the Congress; (4)
that there is no way out now other than the convening of a congress of the
committees themselves without the C.C. and the Council; (5) that the
Bureau undertakes to help the constructive work of the committees; (13) that the
Central Organ has utterly lost the membership’s confidence by its vacillations
and lies.


Believe me, we highly appreciate Zemlyachka, but she is wrong in her opposition
to Papasha,[5]

and it is for you to correct her mistakes. Let us hurry up and
break with the C.C. all along the line, and publish a statement about the Bureau
at once to the effect that it is the Organising Committee and that it is
convening the Third Congress.

âPort Arthur has surrendered.


âThis event is one of the greatest events in modern history. These four
words, flashed yesterday to all parts of the civilised world, create a crushing
impression, the impression of an overwhelming and appalling catastrophe, a
disaster that beggars description. The moral power of a mighty empire is
crumbling, the prestige of a young race is waning before it has had the chance
to prove itself. Sentence has been passed upon an entire political
system. A long
chain of asserted claims has been broken and mighty efforts have been
frustrated. True, the fall of Port Arthur had long been predicted, and for a
long time people had sought to dismiss it in a few words and to find consolation
in ready-made phrases. But the hard, brutal fact shatters all conventional
lies. The significance of the disaster cannot be underrated now. For the first
time the old world has been humiliated by an irreparable defeat dealt it by the
new world, a world mysterious, and, to all appearances, adolescent, which was
only yesterday won to civilisation.â


Thus writes a respectable European bourgeois newspaper under the direct impact
of the event. Admittedly, it has done more than merely express in trenchant
words the sentiments of the entire European bourgeoisie. Through the words of
this newspaper speaks the true class instinct of the bourgeoisie of the old
world, which is perturbed by the victories of the new bourgeois world and
alarmed by the collapse of Russia’s military power, which for a long time had
been considered the bulwark of European reaction. Small wonder that even the
European bourgeoisie, which has taken no part in the war, feels humiliated and
depressed. It had grown so accustomed

    

 to identify Russia’s moral strength with the military strength of the
      gendarme of Europe. In its eyes the prestige of the young Russian race was
      inseparably bound up with that of tsarism, that unshakable authority,
      which strongly safeguarded the existing âorder of
      thingsâ. Small wonder that the disaster which has overtaken the
      rulers and commanders of Russia seems âappallingâ to the whole
      European bourgeoisie. This disaster implies a tremendous acceleration of
      world wide capitalist development, a quickening of history’s pace; and the
      bourgeoisie knows only too well from bitter experience that this means
      the acceleration of the social revolution of the proletariat. The
      bourgeoisie of Western Europe fell so secure in the atmosphere of
      long-lasting stagnation, under the wing of the âmighty
      Empireâ, and now suddenly some âmysterious, adolescentâ
      power dares to disturb this stagnation and shatter this pillar.


Indeed, the European bourgeoisie has cause for alarm. The proletariat has cause
for rejoicing. The disaster that has overtaken our mortal enemy not only
signifies the approach of freedom in Russia, it also presages a new
revolutionary upsurge of the European proletariat.


But why and to what extent is the fall of Port Arthur really an historic
disaster?


The first thing that strikes the eye is the effect of this event on the trend of
the war. The main objective of the Japanese in this war has been
attained. Advancing, progressive Asia has dealt backward and reactionary Europe
an irreparable blow. Ten years ago this reactionary Europe, with Russia in the
lead, was perturbed by the defeat of China at the hands of young Japan, and it
united to rob Japan of the best fruits of her victory. Europe was protecting
the established relations and privileges of the old world, its prerogative to
exploit the Asian peoples—a prerogative held from time immemorial and sanctified by the usage of centuries. The recovery of Port Arthur by Japan is a blow
struck at the whole of reactionary Europe. Russia held Port Arthur for six years
and spent hundreds of millions of rubles on the building of strategic railways,
harbours,and new towns, on fortifying a stronghold which the en tire mass of
European newspapers, bribed by Russia and fawning on Russia, declared to be
impregnable. Military commentators write that Port Arthur was as strong as six
Sevastopols.

    

And behold, little Japan,hitherto despised by all, captures this
stronghold in eight months, when it took England and France together a whole
year to capture Sevastopol. The military blow is irreparable. The question of
supremacy on the seas, the main and vital issue of the present war, has been
settled. The Russian Pacific fleet, which at the outset was certainly not
weaker, if actually not stronger, than the Japanese fleet, has been completely
destroyed. The very base for naval operations has been lost, and the only thing
left for Rozhdestvensky’s naval squadron is to turn back shamefully after a
useless expenditure of more millions, after the great victory of his formidable
battleships over the English fishing smacks. It is believed that Russia’s loss
in naval tonnage alone amounts to 300,000,000 rubles. More important, however,
is the loss of some ten thousand of the navy’s best men, and the loss of an
entire army. Many European papers are now trying to minimise the importance of
these losses, and their efforts to do so lead them to such ridiculous assertions
as that Kuropatkin is now ârelievedâ, âfreedâ of his
worries over Port Arthur! Russia’s military forces have also been relieved of an
entire army. According to the latest English reports, no fewer than 48,000
men have been taken prisoner, and there is no telling how many thousands
more were killed in the battles of Kinchow and at the fortress itself. The
Japanese are in complete possession of the Liaotung Peninsula; they have
acquired a base of operations of incalculable importance for exerting pressure
on Korea, China, and Manchuria; they have released for action against Kuropatkin
a battle-tried army of from 80,000 to 100,000 strong, reinforced by formidable
heavy artillery which, when brought up to the Shaho River, will give them an
overwhelming superiority over the main Russian forces.


According to reports in the foreign press, the autocratic government has decided
to continue the war at all costs, and to send Kuropathin 200,000 more men. It is
highly probable that the war will drag on for a long time, but its hopelessness
is already apparent, and all delays will only aggravate the innumerable
calamities which the Russian people are suffering because they still tolerate
the yoke of the autocracy on their neck. As it is, the Japanese have reinforced
their troops after every big battle in less time and in greater numbers

    

than the Russians. And now that they have achieved complete supremacy on the
      sea and have utterly annihilated one of Russia’s armies, they will be able
      to send twice as many reinforcements as the Russians. As it is, the
      Japanese beat the Russian generals time and again, although the bulk of
      their best artillery was engaged in siege warfare. Now they have achieved
      complete concentration of their forces, while the Russians have to fear
      for Vladivostok, as well as for Sakhalin. The Japanese have occupied the
      best and most populated part of Manchuria, where they can maintain an
      army at the expense of the conquered territory and with the help of China,
      whereas the Russians have to depend more and more upon supplies
      transported from Russia, and it will soon be impossible for Kuropatkin to
      increase his army any further, in view of the impossibility of bringing up
      sufficient sup plies.


But the military debacle which the autocracy has suffered has deeper
implications; it signifies the collapse of our entire political system. The days
when wars were fought by mercenaries or by representatives of a caste
half-isolated from the people have gone for ever. Wars today are fought by
peoples; even Kuropatkin, according to Nemirovich-Danchenko, has begun to
realise that this is the truth and not a mere copy-book motto. Wars today are
fought by peoples; this now brings out more strikingly than ever a great
attribute of war, namely, that it opens the eyes of millions to the disparity
between the people and the government, which heretofore was evident only to a
small class-conscious minority. The criticism of the autocracy by all
progressive Russians, by the Russian Social-Democrats, by the Russian
proletariat, has now been confirmed in the criticism by Japanese arms,

con firmed 

in such wise that the impossibility of living under the autocracy is
felt more and more even by those who do not know what autocracy means, even
by those who do know, but yet would maintain it with all their soul. The
incompatibility of the autocracy with the interests of social development, with
the interests of the entire people (apart from a handful of bureaucrats and
bigwigs), became evident as soon as the people actually had to pay for the
autocracy with their life blood. Its foolish and criminal colonial adventure has
landed the autocracy in an impasse, from which the people can extricate

    

themselves only by their own efforts and only at the cost of destroying
tsarism.


The fall of Port Arthur is a great historic outcome of tsarism’s crimes, which
began to reveal themselves at the outset of the war, and which will now reveal
themselves more and more extensively and unrestrainedly. After us the deluge!
argued all the big and little Alexeyevs,[2]

scarcely thinking or
believing that the deluge would actually come. The generals and
commanders-in-chief proved themselves incompetent non entities. In the expert
opinion of an English military observer (in The Times), the whole
story of the 1904 campaign was one of criminal neglect of the elementary
principles of naval and military strategy. The civil and military bureaucracy
proved as parasitic and venal now as in the days of serfdom. The officers proved
uneducated, undeveloped, and untrained. They were not in close touch with the
soldiers, nor did they enjoy their confidence. The ignorance, illiteracy, and
backwardness of the peasant masses became appallingly obvious when they came up
against a progressive nation in modern warfare, which requires high-quality
manpower as imperatively as does modern technique. Success in modern war fare
is impossible without intelligent soldiers and sailors who possess
initiative. No amount of endurance or physical strength, no herding of men into
solid ranks for mass actions can guarantee superiority in an age of quick-firing
small arms and quick-firing cannon, when naval battles are fought with the aid
of intricate mechanisms and land actions are fought in extended order. The
military might of autocratic Russia has proved to be a sham. Tsarism has proved
to be a hindrance to the organisation of up-to-date efficient warfare, that very
business to which tsarism dedicated itself so whole heartedly, of which it was
so proud, and for which it offered such colossal sacrifices in defiance to all
opposition on the part of the people. A whited sepulchre is what tsarism has
proved to be in the field of external defence, which was its favourite
speciality, so to say. Events have corroborated the opinion of those foreigners
who laughed upon seeing hundreds of millions squandered on the purchase and
building of splendid warships, and who declared that those expenditures were
useless if no one knew how to manipulate such modern vessels, if there were no
people with the necessary technical

    

knowledge to utilise the latest achievements of military engineering. Both the
      navy and the fortress, the field fortifications and the army proved to
      be antiquated and utterly useless.


Never before has the military organisation of a country had such a close bearing
on its entire economic and cultural system. The military debacle, therefore,
could not but precipitate a profound political crisis. Here again, as so often
in history,the war between an advanced and a backward country has played a great
revolutionary role. And the class-conscious proletariat, an implacable enemy of
war— this inevitable and inseverable concomitant of all class rule in
general—can not shut its eyes to the revolutionary task which the Japanese
bourgeoisie, by its crushing defeat of the Russian autocracy, is carrying
out. The proletariat is hostile to every bourgeoisie and to all manifestations
of the bourgeois system, but this hostility does not relieve it of the duty of
distinguishing between the historically progressive and the reactionary representatives of the bourgeoisie. It is quite understandable, therefore,that the
most consistent and staunch representatives of revolutionary international
Social-Democracy, such as Jules Guesde in France and Hyndman in England,
unequivocally expressed their sympathy with Japan, which is routing the Russian
autocracy. Here in Russia, of course, some socialists were found to have muddled
ideas on this question, too. Revolutsionnaya Rossiya[3]

rebuked Guesde and Hyndman, saying that a socialist could only be in
favour of a workers’ Japan, a people’s Japan, and not of a bourgeois
Japan. This rebuke is as absurd as blaming a socialist for admitting the
progressive nature of the free-trade bourgeoisie as compared with the
protectionist bourgeoisie. Guesde and Hyndman did not defend the Japanese
bourgeoisie or Japanese imperialism; they correctly noted in this conflict
between two bourgeois countries the historically progressive role of one of
them. The muddle-headedness of the âSocialists-Revolutionariesâ
was, of course, an inevitable result of the failure on the part of our radical
intelligentsia to understand the class point of view and historical
materialism. Neither could the new Iskra help showing muddled
thinking. It had quite a lot to say at first about peace at any price. It then
made haste to âcorrect itselfâ, when Jaurès showed plainly whose
interests,

    

those of the progressive or those of the reactionary bourgeoisie, would be
served by a quasi-socialist campaign for peace in general. And now it has ended
up with platitudes about the unreasonableness of âspeculatingâ (?!)
on a victory of the Japanese bourgeoisie and about war being a calamity
âregard less of whetherâ it ends in the victory or the defeat of the
autocracy.


No. The cause of Russian freedom and of the struggle of the Russian (and the
world) proletariat for socialism depends to a very large extent on the military
defeats of the autocracy. This cause has been greatly advanced by the military
debacle which has struck terror in the hearts of all the European guardians of
the existing order. The revolutionary proletariat must carry on a ceaseless
agitation against war, always keeping in mind, however, that wars are
inevitable as long as class rule exists. Trite phrases about peace
à la
Jaurès are of no use to the oppressed class, which is not responsible for a
bourgeois war between two bourgeois nations, which is doing all it can to
overthrow every bourgeoisie, which knows the enormity of the people’s sufferings
even in time of âpeacefulâ capitalist exploitation. While
struggling against free competition, we cannot, however, forget its progressive
character in comparison with the semi-feudal system. While struggling against
every war and every bourgeoisie, we must draw a clear line in our agitational
work between the progressive bourgeoisie and the feudal autocracy; we must
recognise the great revolutionary role of the historic war in which the Russian
worker is an involuntary participant.


It was the Russian autocracy and not the Russian people that started this
colonial war, which has turned into a war between the old and the new bourgeois
worlds. It is the autocratic regime and not the Russian people that has suffered ignoble defeat. The Russian people has gained from the defeat of the
autocracy. The capitulation of Port Arthur is the prologue to the capitulation
of tsarism. The war is not ended yet by far, but every step towards its
continuation increases immeasurably the unrest and discontent among the Russian
people, brings nearer the hour of a new great war, the war of the people
against the autocracy, the war of the proletariat for liberty. There is good
reason for the concern shown by that most sedate and sober European bourgeoisie,
which would

    

heartily sympathise with the granting of liberal concessions by the Russian
      autocracy, but which stands in mortal fear of a Russian revolution, as the
      prologue to a European revolution.


âThere is a deep-rooted opinion,â writes one such sober organ of the
German bourgeoisie, âthat it is absolutely impossible for a revolution to
break out in Russia. Every kind of argument is used to support this view: the
inertness of the Russian peasantry, its faith in the tsar, its dependence on the
clergy; the extreme elements among the discontented, it is claimed, constitute a
mere handful, who can organise putsches and terrorist attempts, but are
absolutely incapable of calling forth a general popular uprising. The broad mass
of the discontented, we are told, lack organisation, arms, and— most
important of all—the determination to risk their lives. As for the Russian
intellectual, he is usually revolutionary-minded only until about the age of
thirty, after which he settles down comfortably in some cushy government job,
and thus most of the hotheads undergo a metamorphosis and become run-of-the-mill
officials.â But now, the newspaper continues, there are many indications of a
big change. The revolutionaries are not the only ones now who speak about a
revolution in Russia; the topic is even in the mouths of such
âunenthusiasticâ and solid pillars of law and order as Prince
Trubetskoi, whose letter to the Minister of the Interior is now being reprinted
by the entire European press. âThere is evidently real ground for the
fear of a revolution in Russia. True, no one believes that the Russian peasants
will take up their pitchforks and go forward to fight for a constitution. But,
then, are revolutions made in villages? In modern his tory the big cities long
ago became the vehicles of the revolutionary movement. And in Russia it is the
cities that are in ferment, from north to south and from east to west. No one
will venture to predict the outcome, but it is an incontrovertible fact that
the number of people who consider a revolution in Russia impossible is
diminishing day by day. And if a serious revolutionary outbreak does occur, it
is more than doubtful whether the autocracy, weakened by the war in the Far
East, will be able to cope with it.â


Yes, the autocracy is weakened. The most sceptical of the sceptics are beginning
to believe in the revolution.

    

General belief in revolution is already the beginning of revolution. The
government itself, by its military adventure, is seeing to its continuation. The
Russian proletariat will see to it that the serious revolutionary onset is
sustained and extended.

We draw the attention of our readers to the pamphlet Workers and
Intellectuals in Our Organisations, by âA Workerâ, which the
new-Iskrists have just issued with a foreword by Axelrod. We shall probably have
occasion more than once to refer to this edifying tract, which illustrates
beautifully what fruits the demagogic preaching of the âMinorityâ,
or new Iskrists, has borne and continues to bear, and how the latter are now
trying to get out of the verbal mess into which they have talked themselves. For
the present we shall merely note the main points in the pamphlet and the
foreword.


âA Workerâ had the misfortune to believe the rantings of the
new-Iskrists. Hence we find so many Rabocheye Dyelo phrases

d Ia 

Akimov in his pamphlet. âOur leaders from among the
intellectuals ... did not set themselves the task ...
of developing the class-consciousness and initiative of the workers....â Any
endeavour to display initiative was âsystematically
persecutedâ. âIn no single type of organisation has there been room
for developing independent activity of the workers....â âThe economic
struggle was wholly neglectedâ; âworkers were not admittedâ
even to agitation and propaganda meetings (who would have believed
it!). Demonstrations âhave outlived themselvesâ—all these horrors
(which the old Rabocheye Dyelo used to cast in the teeth of the old
Iskra long ago) are, of course, the work of âthe bureaucratic
centralistsâ, viz., the majority at our Second Congress, which fought
against Rabocheye Dyelo-ism. Set on against the Party Congress by the
sulky minority, the poor âWorkerâ attacks this Congress because it
was held âwithout usâ (without the workers), âwithout our
participationâ, because there was âhardly a single workerâ
there. Of course, the fact that all the real worker delegates at the
Congress—Stepanov, Gorsky, and

    

Braun—staunchly supported the majority and opposed the spinelessness of
the intellectuals is discreetly passed over. But this does not matter. What
matters is the depth of depravity that results from the rantings of these
new-Iskra people, who âattackâ the Congress after being
defeated at the elections, who attack it before those who did not participate
in the Congress, inciting them to treat all Social-Democratic congresses with
contempt; who attack it at the very time when they have so nobly wormed their
way into the central bodies which act exclusively by authority of the
Congress. Is not Ryazanov’s stand far more honest? (See his pamphlet Shattered Illusions.) He bluntly declared that the Congress was
packed; but at least he has not been invested by this âpacked
congressâ with any title or office.


It is highly characteristic of the psychology of a worker, even though his mind
has been turned against the âMajorityâ, that he is not satisfied
with phrases about autonomy, workers’ independent activity, etc. He repeats
these words like every new-Iskrist or Rabocheye Dyelo-ist; but with
sober proletarian instinct he insists on deeds in confirmation of
words, he does not want his parsnips buttered with fine
words. âWith out a change in the compositionâ (âA
Worker’sâ italics) of the leadership, fine words remain but words, he
declares. It is necessary to demand the admission of workers to all
important. Party bodies, to secure for them equal rights with the intellectuals. With the deep distrust of a true proletarian and a true democrat
towards all bombast, âA Workerâ exclaims:
What guarantee is there that the committees will not have only intellectuals
sitting on them? This hits the nail on the head as far as our new-Iskrists
are concerned. This excellent question shows that the Rabocheye Dyelo
incitements have so far failed to befuddle the clear mind of the
proletarian. He states bluntly that the committee in which he worked
âremained a committee of the Minority only in principle, on paper [mark
this!], while in its actions it differed in no way from a committee of the
Majority. We workers have had no access to any important, that is to say
leading, Party body (let alone the Committee)â.


No one could have shown up the Mensheviks better than this Menshevik worker has
done. He understands that without guarantees all this ranting about
autonomy and independent

    

activity of the proletariat remains what it is—cheap phrase mongering. But
      what guarantees are possible in Social-Democratic
    organisations—have you ever thought of that, Comrade âWorkerâ?
    What guarantees are there that revolutionaries who gathered at a Party
    congress, resentful over the fact that the Congress did not elect them, will
    not

after wards 

shout that the Congress was a reactionary attempt to put
    over the viewpoint of the Iskrists (see Trotsky’s pamphlet issued under
      the editorship of the new âIskraâ), that its decisions
    are not sacred, that there were no workers from among the masses at the
    Congress? What guarantees are there that the general decision concerning the
    forms and guiding rules of Party organisation, a decision called the
    Organisational Rules of the Party and which cannot exist except in the form
    of such Rules—that this decision is not broken eventually by
    characterless people, with regard to that part of it which they find
    distasteful, on the pretext that such things as Rules are bureaucratic and
    formalistic? What guarantees are there that people who have broken the
    collectively adopted Rules of organisation will not afterwards begin to
    argue that organisation is a process, that organisation is a tendency, that
    organisation is a form that keeps in step with its content, and that it is
    therefore absurd and utopian to demand observance of the Rules of
    organisation? âA Workerâ, the author of the pamphlet, did not
    ponder over any one of these questions. But he approached them so closely,
    so very closely, he put them so bluntly, so candidly and boldly to the
    phrase-mongers and politicians, that we heartily recommend his pamphlet. It
    shows admirably how the knights of the âfine phraseâ are ex
    posed by their own followers.


âA Workerâ, acting on second-hand information, objects to Lenin’s
âorganisational planâ, but as usual he does not indicate a
single clear and precise ground for his objection. He mentions Panin
and Cherevanin[4]

 (who have contributed nothing but angry words), but he does not
so much as take a glance at Lenin’s much-talked-of letter to a
St. Petersburg comrade. If âA Workerâ had not taken his abettors at
their word, but had looked at that letter, he would have read, to his great
surprise, the following:


âWe should particularly see to it that as many workers as
possible become fully class-conscious and professional

    

revolutionaries and members of the committee. We must try to get on the
committee revolutionary workers who have the greatest contacts and the best
’reputation’ among the mass of the workers. The committee should, therefore,
include, as far as possible, all the principal leaders of the working-class
movement from among the workers themselves.â (âLetterâ,
pp.

7-8).[1]


Read and re-read these lines, Comrade âWorkerâ, and you will see how
you have been hoodwinked by the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists and
new-Iskrists, who are attacking the old Iskra and its followers, the
âmajorityâ of the Second Congress. Read the lines carefully and see
if you will accept the challenge I put forth. Find me another passage
in our Social-Democratic literature where the question you raised about
âthe workers and intellectuals in our organisationsâ is presented
so clearly, directly, and decidedly,and where, moreover, the necessity
is pointed out of getting as many workers as possible on the committee,
of getting to the extent possible all leaders of the labour movement from among
the working class on the committee. I say that you will not be able to point
to another such passage. I say that anyone who takes the trouble to study
our Party differences from documents, from Rabocheye Dyelo, from
Iskra, and from the pamphlets—and not from tales spread by
gossips—will see the falsity and the demagogic nature of the new
Iskra’s preaching.


You will perhaps answer: Lenin may have written this, but his advice was not
always taken. Of course, that is possible. No Party writer will vouch that all
who call themselves his adherents always actually follow his counsels. But, in
the first place, would not a Social-Democrat who called himself an adherent of
the âLetterâ while at the same time not following its counsels be
exposed by that very letter? Was the letter printed for intellectuals only, and
not for workers as well? Has a writer any means of stating his views other than
a printed statement? Secondly, if these counsels were not heeded, as âA
Workerâ, for instance, testifies, either by the Mensheviks or by the
Bolsheviks, does it not clearly follow that the Mensheviks had no right to
invent such a âdisagreementâ with the

    

Bolsheviks, that their incitement of the workers against the Bolsheviks on the
      grounds that the latter ignored the workers’ independent activity was
      sheer demagogy?


Wherein, then, lies the real difference on this point between
the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks? Is it not in the fact that the Bolsheviks
came forward much earlier and much more directly with clear and definite advice
to place workers on the committee? Is it not in the fact that the Bolsheviks
have always despised âfine phrasesâ about the workers’ autonomy and
independent activity, when such utterances remain mere words (as they do with
the Mensheviks)?


See now how the respectable, worthy, patriarchal Axelrod wriggles in his
foreword when he is driven into a corner by the proletarian bluntness and
boldness of a worker, who has imbibed so much Rabocheye Dyelo wisdom
from Axelrod’s âadmirableâ feuilletons, Martov’s
unforgettable articles, and (from the point of view of the interests of the
âMajorityâ) Trotsky’s excellent pamphlet.


âA Workerâ tries to question Ryadovoi’s[5]

assertion that since
the time of Economism the membership of our Party organisation has become
relatively more proletarian. âA Workerâ is obviously wrong. Anyone
who has observed the activities of our Party at close range for any length of
time knows this. Most curious of all, however, is the sight of our old Axelrod
changing front. Who does not remember his stout assertions, so skilfully
utilised by the enemies of Social-Democracy, the Osvobozhdeniye
liberals, that the Social-Democratic Party is an organisation of intellectuals?
Who does not remember how the new-Iskrists, with their grudge against the Party,
harped on this slander of the Party? And now the selfsame Axelrod, frightened by
the direct and honest conclusions which âA Workerâ has drawn from
this slander, tries to dodge the issue:


âDuring the period of the inception and early development of
Social-Democracy,â he says in his foreword, âthe Russian revolutionary
party was purely a party of the intelligentsia.... Now the class-conscious
revolutionary workers form the main body

[mark this! I 

of the Social-Democratic
Partyâ (op. cit., p. 15).


Poor âWorkerâ! How severe his punishment is for having believed Axelrod’s
âfine wordsâ! Such punishment is the inevitable

    

 consequence of trust in writers who for a year and a half have been
saying first one thing then another to suit the exigencies of
âco-optationâ.


See how Axelrod dodges the question of âguaranteesâ when he has to
meet it outright. Why, it is a positive delight, a gem of new-Iskra
literature. âA Workerâ speaks of the relation between the workers
and the intellectuals within the organisations. âA Workerâ
is profoundly correct in declaring that without guarantees, without
equal rights, i.e., without the principle of elective office, all fine words
about non-bureaucratic centralism are mere phrase-mongering. And what does
Axelrod say in answer? âOver-zealousness for the idea of change in the
status of the workers in our organisations is one-sidedness.â The author
erroneously shifts the issue of eradicating evil âinto the sphere of
formal organisational relationsâ; he forgets that âthe particular
question of equalisation of rightsâ can be solved only âin the
process of the further development of our experience in a Social-Democratic
directionâ. âThe problem that particularly engages the author of
the pamphlet can be radically dealt with only in the process of consciously
collective work by our Party.â


Truly a gem! Why, it was none other than Axelrod who was the first to raise this
very question of organisation, and only of organisation, at the League

       Congress[2]

and in the new Iskra (No. 55); but when âA Workerâ writes a
special pamphlet on organisation, he is told pontifically that it is not
formality that counts, but the process of work!


It is not the principles of organisation that matter to the new Iskra
and to Axelrod, but the process of twaddle to justify an unprincipled
stand. There is no meaning except a defence of unprincipledness in the whole
notorious organisation-as-process theory (see particularly Rosa Luxemburg’s
articles), a theory that vulgarises and prostitutes Marxism.


We repeat, âA Worker’sâ admirable pamphlet cannot be recommended too
highly as evidence of the utter falseness of the new-Iskrist position on the
organisational question. We recommend this pamphlet particularly to workers whom
the Mensheviks are trying to turn against the Bolsheviks by

    

preaching the elective

      principle.[3]

 The workers are splendid at exposing
      phrase-mongers and liars. They put the question excellently: either the
      elective principle or only the advice to place workers on the
      committees. If it is to be the elective principle, give us formal
      guarantees, guarantees of equality embodied in the Rules. The workers will
      see the new-Iskrists running from a solution of this question as the devil
      runs from holy water. If advice to place workers on the committees is
      desirable, if the old Iskra was right in maintaining that
    democracy, i.e., the universal application of the elective principle in
    Russian secret organisations, is incompatible with the autocratic
    police-ridden regime, then nowhere will you find such direct and
    instructive advice to place workers on the committees as that given by the

this agony satisfies me very well. The workers’ demand that offices be
elective shows plainly that the new-Iskrists did not succeed in buttering
the workers’ parsnips with fine words, and that no evasions can now save
Axelrod from complete exposure.  —Lenin

Genève, le 18. I.

 1905[1]


Dear Comrades,


We are unable to call a meeting of the Editorial Board to answer your inquiry,
and I therefore take the liberty of answering you myself. The Zurich group of
Bolsheviks asks âwhat our attitude is to the Central Organ and the Central
Commit tee; whether we consider them as existing legitimately but operating
illegitimately and are in opposition to them, or whether we refuse to recognise
them altogether as Party centres.â


It seems to me that your question savours somewhat of casuistry. The
announcement of the newspaper Vperyod[4]

and the first issue (âTime to Call a

       Halt!â[2]

),

together with my Statement and

  Documents,[3]

would seem to have answered this question in
substance. The leading centres (the Central Organ, the Central Committee,
and the Council) have broken with the Party, sabotaged the Second and
the Third Congresses, duped the Party in the most brazen way, and usurped their
snug jobs in a truly Bonapartist manner. How can one speak here of the
legitimate existence of the centres? Is a swindler the legitimate owner of the
money he has pocketed on a forged note?


It seems strange to me that the Zurich Bolsheviks should still be puzzled, after
this question has been thrashed out again and again. That the centres did not
want to submit to the Party has been proved conclusively. Then what are we to

    

do? Convene the Third Congress? They have deceived us on that score, too. One
      thing remains—to break with the Mensheviks as completely,
    as quickly, and as definitely (openly, publicly) as possible, and to convene
    our own Third Party Congress, without the consent of the central bodies and
    with out their participation, to begin immediately (without waiting
    for this centre either) to work with our own Party centres, the Editorial
    Board of Vperyod, and the Russian Bureau elected by the Northern
    Conference.


I repeat: the centres have put themselves out side the Party. There is
no middle ground; one is either with the centres or with the Party. It is time
to draw the line of demarcation and, unlike the Mensheviks, who are splitting
the Party secretly, to accept their challenge openly. Yes, a split, for you have
gone the whole hog with your splitting. Yes, a split, for we have exhausted
all means of delay and of obtaining a Party decision (by a
Third Congress). Yes, a split, for everywhere the disgusting squabbles with the
disorganisers have only harmed the cause. We have received letters from
St. Peters burg saying that things have taken a turn for the better since the
split, that one can work without squabbles, with people whom one trusts. Is not
this perfectly clear? Down with the Bonapartists and the disorganisers!


Let us know whether you are satisfied with this answer.


It is essential
that the groups of the Majority abroad close their ranks. Write about the issue
immediately to the Berne comrades (Herrn Kazakow, Bäckereiweg, 1.
Bern). They are already at it and will answer you better than I can. We must
tackle the matter more energetically. Correspond with all the groups, spur them
on in regard to money and material, initiate groups in new places, etc.


We likewise have begun to feel much better since we broke decisively with the
Minority. We heartily wish you, too, a speedy riddance of them.


I clasp your hand,

Yours,
N. Lenin

P.S. Please give my special personal regards to Meyerson. How is he
getting on? Does he feel better?

 

 I am angry at Steiner—tell her it’s disgusting; she promised to
 write about Nikolayev by Christmas, and we’re nearly at the end of
 January!


 The Berne group has undertaken to unite the Bolsheviks abroad, under
 the leadership of the Bureau, of course. Ask the Berne group for
 their letter to us on this question and the answer of the Geneva
 group.

January 19, 1905


Dear Friends,


I have received your inquiry concerning the tactics to be pursued in court
(in Absolute’s[2]

letter and the note

âreport ed 

verbatimâ through an unknown person). Absolute writes of two points of
view. The note speaks of three groups; perhaps it has in mind three shades of
opinion, which I shall attempt to reconstruct as follows: (1) To refuse to
recognise the court and to boycott it outright. (2) To refuse to recognise the
court and not to participate in the court proceedings; to employ a lawyer only
with the understanding that he speak exclusively about the court’s lack of
jurisdiction from the point of view of abstract law; in the concluding speech
for the defence to make a profession de

       foi[1]

and to demand a trial by
jury. (3) The same applies to the defendant’s last statement. To use the trial
as a means of agitation and, for this purpose, to take part in the court
proceedings with the aid of legal counsel; to show up the unlawfulness of the
trial and even to call witnesses (to prove alibis, etc.).


There is this further question: should you say only that you are a
Social-Democrat

·by 

conviction, or should you admit that you are a member
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party?


You write that a pamphlet is needed on this question. I do not think it is
advisable to issue a pamphlet straight away

    

without any experience to go by. Perhaps we shall mention it somehow in the
newspaper when the opportunity occurs. Perhaps one of the people in prison will
write a short article for the paper (from 5,000 to 8,000 letters)? I think this
would be the best way to start the discussion.


I personally have not yet formed a definite opinion and should prefer, before
committing myself, to talk it over in detail with comrades who are in prison or
have stood trial. To get such a talk started I shall state my own ideas on the
subject. Much depends, I think, on the kind of trial it will be, viz.,
whether or not there will be a possibility to utilise it for purposes of
agitation. In the first instance, policy No. 1 will not do; in the second, it is
appropriate, but only after an open, definite, and energetic protest and
statement.

How ever, 

if there is a chance of taking advantage of the trial for
agitational purposes, policy No. 3 is desirable. A speech with a profession
de foi is generally most desirable, and, I think, very useful, and it could
in most cases have an agitational effect. Particularly when the government has
begun to utilise the courts, the Social-Democrats should speak out about the
Social-Democratic programme and tactics. Some hold that it is not advisable to
declare oneself a member of the Party, particularly of any definite
organisation; that one should rather declare oneself a Social-Democrat by
conviction and limit the statement to that. I think that one’s affiliations
should be omitted entirely from the speech, i.e., that one should say: For
obvious reasons I shall not speak about my affiliations, but I am a
Social-Democrat and I shall speak of

  o u r

Party. Such a formulation
has two advantages: it states directly and specifically that one is not to speak
of one’s affiliations (viz., whether one belongs to an organisation, and if so,
to which, etc.), while at the same time one speaks of our Party. This
is necessary in order that Social-Democratic speeches in court may become Party
speeches and statements, in order that the Party may benefit by this
propaganda. In other words, I waive my formal affiliations; I pass them over in
silence, I do not speak formally in the name of any organisation whatever, but
as a Social-Democrat I speak to the court of our Party and ask it to
accept my statements as an endeavour to expound precisely the Social-Democratic
views that have been set forth in all our Social-Democratic

    

literature, in such-and-such pamphlets, leaflets, and newspapers.


As to lawyers. Lawyers should be kept well in hand and made to toe the line, for
there is no telling what dirty tricks this intellectualist scum will be up
to. They should be warned in advance: Look here, you confounded rascal, if you
permit yourself the slightest impropriety or political opportunism (if
you speak of socialism as something immature or wrong-headed, or as an
infatuation, or if you say that the Social-Democrats reject the use of
force, speak of their teachings and their movement as peaceful, etc., or
anything of the sort), then I, the defendant, will pull you up publicly, right
then and there, call you a scoundrel, declare that I reject such a defence,
etc. And these threats must be carried out. Only clever lawyers should be
engaged; we do not need others. They should be told beforehand: Confine
yourselves to criticising and âlaying trapsâ for witnesses and the
public prosecutor on the facts of the case, and to nailing trumped-up charges;
confine yourselves exclusively to discrediting the
Shemyakin-trial[3]

features
of the proceedings. Even a smart liberal lawyer is extremely prone to mention
or hint at the peaceful nature of the Social-Democratic movement, at
the recognition of its cultural influence even by people like Adolf Wagner,
etc. All such attempts should be nipped in the bud. The lawyers, as Bebel, I
believe, said, are the most reactionary of people. The cobbler should stick to
his last. Be a lawyer only, ridicule the witnesses for the State and the Public
Prosecutor; at most, draw a comparison between such a trial and a trial by jury
in a free country; but leave the defendant’s convictions alone, do not even dare
to mention what you think of his convictions and actions. For you, a measly liberal, have so little understanding of these convictions that even in praising
them you will not be able to avoid saying something banal. Of course, all this
need not be explained to the lawyer d la Sobakevich[4];

it can be done
mildly, tactfully, discreetly. Still, it is better to be wary of lawyers and
not to trust them, especially if they say that they are Social-Democrats and Party members (as defined by our Clause 1!).


The question of taking part in the court proceedings, it seems to me, depends on
the question of the lawyer. Retaining counsel means participating in the court
proceedings.

    

And why not participate in order to show up witnesses and agitate against
the court? Of course, one must be very careful not to slip into a tone of
unbecoming self-vindication— that goes without saying. It is best to
declare immediately, before the taking of testimony, in answering the
presiding judge’s first questions: I am a Social-Democrat, and in my speech to
the court I shall explain what that means. In each case, the question whether or
not to take part in the court proceedings depends entirely upon the
circumstances. Let us assume that you have been proved guilty, that the witnesses are telling the truth, that the entire accusation rests on unassailable
documentary evidence. In that case it may be of no use to take part in the court
proceedings, and all attention should be centred on the declaration of
principles. If, however, the facts are dubious, if the police witnesses are
confused and lie, then it is hardly worth while to miss an opportunity of making
propaganda by exposing the case as a frame-up. Much depends also on the
defendants; if they are very tired, ill, or worn-out, and if there is no one
among them with experience in âpleadingâ and word-tilting, then, perhaps, it would be more expedient to refuse to participate in the court
proceedings, to make a statement to that effect, and to concentrate on the
declaration of principles, which it is desirable to prepare in advance. At any
rate, the speech on the principles, the programme, and the tactics of the Social-Democratic Party, on the working-class movement, on the socialist aims, and
on uprising is the most important thing.


In conclusion, I repeat once more: These are my first reflections, which should
not be regarded in the least as an attempt to solve the problem. We must wait
until experience gives us certain hints. And while accumulating this
experience the comrades, in the majority of cases, will have to be
guided by a
consideration of the concrete circumstances and by their revolutionary
instinct.



My very best regards to Kurz, Ruben, Bauman, and all the other friends. Cheer
up! Things are going well with us now. We are through with the trouble-makers at
last. We have done with the tactics of retreat. We are attacking

    

now. The committees in Russia are also beginning to break with the
      disorganisers. We have founded a newspaper of our own. We have our own
      practical centre (the Bureau). Two is sues of the paper have appeared and
      shortly (January 23, 1905, new style) the third will be coming
    out. We hope to publish it as a weekly. Best of health and good cheer! We
    shall meet again, I am sure, and carry on the fight under better conditions
    than amid the squabbling and wrangling we
have here, after the manner of the League congresses.

Geneva, January 10 (23)

The working class, which would seem to have stood aside for a long
  time from the bourgeois opposition movement, has raised its
  voice. With incredible speed the broad masses of the workers have
  caught up with their advanced comrades, the class-conscious
  Social-Democrats. The workers’ movement in St. Petersburg these
  days has made gigantic strides.  Economic demands are giving way to
  political demands. The strike is turning into a general strike and
  it has led to an unheard-of colossal demonstration; the prestige of
  the tsarist name has been ruined for good. The uprising has
  begun. Force against force. Street fighting is raging, barricades
  are being thrown up, rifles are crackling, guns are roaring. Rivers
  of blood are flowing, the civil war for freedom is blazing up.
  Moscow and the South, the Caucasus and Poland are ready to join the
  proletariat of St. Petersburg. The slogan of the workers has become:
  Death or freedom!  Today and tomorrow a great deal will be
  decided. The situation changes with every hour. The telegraph brings
  breath-taking news, and all words now seem feeble in comparison with
  the events we are living through. Everyone must be ready to do his
  duty as a revolutionary and as a Social-Democrat.
  

    Long live the revolution!


    Long live the insurgent proletariat!

The question of the attitude of the Social-Democrats, or working-class
democrats, to the bourgeois democrats is an old and yet ever new question. It is
old because it has been an issue ever since the inception of
Social-Democracy. Its theoretical principles were elucidated in the earliest
Marxist literature, in the Communist Manifesto and in Capital.
It is ever new because every step in the development of every capitalist
country produces a peculiar, original blending of different shades of bourgeois
democracy and different trends within the socialist movement.


In Russia, too, this old question has become particularly new at the present
time. To make clear for ourselves how this question should be presented today,
we shall begin with a brief excursion into history. The old Russian
revolutionary Narodniks[14]

held a utopian, semi-anarchist point of view. They
considered the peasants in the village communes ready-made socialists. Behind
the liberalism of the educated Russian society they clearly perceived the
ambitious desires of the Russian bourgeoisie. They repudiated the struggle for
political freedom on the grounds that it was a struggle for institutions
advantageous to the bourgeoisie. The Narodnaya Volya members[15]

made a step
forward when they took up the political struggle, but they failed to connect it
with socialism. The clear socialist approach to the question was even
overshadowed when the waning faith in the socialist nature of our communes began
to be renewed with theories in the spirit of V. V.[16]

about the non-class, non-bourgeois nature of the Russian democratic
intelligentsia. The result was that Narodism, which in the past had positively
rejected bourgeois liberalism, began gradually to merge with the latter in a
single

    

liberal-Narodist trend. The bourgeois-democratic nature of the movement among
the Russian intellectuals, beginning with the most moderate, the uplift
movement, and ending with the most extreme, the revolutionary
terrorist movement, became more and more obvious with the rise and development of a
proletarian ideology (Social-Democracy) and a mass working-class movement. But the growth
of the latter was attended by a split among the Social-Democrats. A
revolutionary and an opportunist wing of Social-Democracy became clearly
defined, the former representing the proletarian tendencies in our movement, the
latter the tendencies of the intelligentsia. Legal Marxism[17]

soon proved in
fact to be âthe reflection of Marxism in bourgeois
literatureâ,[18]

and, via Bernsteinian opportunism,[19]

ended up in liberalism. On the
one hand, the Economists in the Social-Democratic movement were carried away by
the semi-anarchist conception of a labour movement pure-and-simple; they
regarded socialist support of the bourgeois opposition as a betrayal of the
class point of view and declared bourgeois democracy in Russia to be a

       phantom.[1]

On the other hand, the Economists of another shade, carried away by
the selfsame idea of a labour movement pure-and-simple, accused the
revolutionary Social-Democrats of ignoring the social struggle against the
autocracy which our liberals, Zemstvo men and uplifters

wage.[2]


The old Iskra pointed to elements of bourgeois democracy in Russia at
a time when many did not yet perceive them. It demanded support for this
democratic trend on the part of the proletariat (see Iskra, No. 2, on
support of the student

      movement[3]

;

No. 8, on the illegal Zemstvo Congress;
No. 16, on the liberal Marshals of the

     Nobility[4]

;

      No. 18[5]

,

on the ferment within the

    

       Zemstvo[6]
et al.). It constantly stressed the class, bourgeois nature of
    the liberal and radical movement and said of the vacillating
    Osvobozhdeniye people: âIt is high time to under stand the
    simple truth that it is not political chicanery, not what the late

      Stepnyak[7]

 once called self-restriction and self-concealment, not the conventional
    lie of diplomatic mutual recognition that ensure a genuine (and not merely
    verbal) joint struggle against the common enemy, but actual participation
    in the struggle, actual unity in struggle. When the struggle of the German
    Social-Democrats against the military-police and feudal-clerical reaction
    really became one with the struggle of any genuine party which relied for
    support upon a definite class of the people (for instance, the liberal
    bourgeoisie), then joint action was instituted without any phrase-mongering
    about mutual recognitionâ

     (No. 26).[8]


This approach to the question on the part of the old Iskra brings us
directly to the present differences over the attitude of the Social-Democrats
towards the liberals. These disputes, as we know, began at the Second Congress,
which adopted two resolutions representing the points of view of the majority
(Plekhanov’s resolution) and of the minority (Starover’s
resolution[20]),

respectively. The first resolution accurately defines the class
character of liberalism, as a movement of the bourgeoisie, and brings to the
fore the task of explaining to the proletariat the anti-revolutionary and
anti-proletarian essence of the main liberal trend (the Osvobozhdeniye
movement). While recognising the need for the proletariat’s support of
bourgeois democracy, this resolution does not resort to the politicians’ mutual
recognition device, but, in the spirit of the old Iskra, makes it a
question of concerted struggle. âTo

    

the extent that the bourgeoisie is revolutionary or merely oppositional
in its struggle against tsarismâ, the Social-Democrats
âmust supportâ it.


Starover’s resolution, on the contrary, does not give a class analysis of
liberalism and democracy. It is full of good intentions, it devises terms of
agreement that are possibly loftier and better, but unfortunately fictitious,
just words: the liberals or the democrats must declare so-and-so, must not put forward such-and-such demands, must adopt
such-and-such a slogan. As if the history of bourgeois democracy
anywhere and everywhere has not warned the workers against putting their trust
in declarations, demands, and slogans. As if history has not afforded us
hundreds of instances in which bourgeois democrats came forward with slogans
demanding, not only full liberty, but also equality, with socialist
slogans—without thereby ceasing to be bourgeois democrats—and thus
âbe foggedâ the minds of the proletariat all the more. The intellectualist wing of Social-Democracy wants to combat this befogging by setting
conditions to the bourgeois democrats that they abstain from befogging. The
proletarian wing, in its struggle, resorts to an analysis of the class content
of democratism. The intellectualist wing hunts out words for terms of an
agreement. The proletarian wing demands actual co-operation in the struggle. The
intellectualist wing devises a criterion of a good and kind bourgeoisie,
worthy of concluding agreements with. The proletarian wing expects no kindness
from the bourgeoisie, but supports any, even the very worst bourgeoisie, to
the extent that it actually fights tsarism. The intellectualist wing slips
into a huckster’s standpoint: if you side with the Social-Democrats and not with
the Socialists-Revolutionaries, we shall agree upon a pact against the common
enemy; otherwise we won’t. The proletarian wing maintains the point of view of
expediency: the support we shall lend you will be exclusively conditioned on
whether it will put us in a better position to aim a blow—greater or
lesser—at our enemy.


All the shortcomings of Starover’s resolution came to light upon its very first
impact with reality. The touch stone was provided by the famous plan of the new
Iskra’s
    

Editorial Board, the plan âof a higher type of mobilisationâ,
      bearing on the debated questions of principle in No. 77 (the editorial
      âDemocracy at the Parting of the Waysâ) and No. 78 (Starover’s
    feuilleton). The plan was dealt with in Lenin’s pamphlet, but the
    arguments will need to be more closely discussed here.


The main idea (or rather the main confusion of ideas) of the new
Iskra’s arguments is the differentiation between the Zemstvo
liberals and the bourgeois democrats. This differentiation is the
guiding thread that runs through both articles. Incidentally, the attentive
reader will observe that in place of the term bourgeois democracy, parallel
with it and synonymously, the following terminology is used: democracy, radical
intelligentsia (sic!), nascent democracy, and intellectualist
democracy. This differentiation was hailed by the new Iskra with
characteristic modesty as a great discovery, an original conception that was
âbeyondâ poor Lenin. The differentiation is linked directly with the
new method of struggle of which we have heard so much both from Trotsky and
directly from the Iskra editors, namely, that Zemstvo liberalism
âis fit only to be chastised with scorpionsâ, while intellectualist
democracy is suitable for agreements with us. Democracy must act independently,
as an independent force. âRussian liberalism, bereft of its historically
essential part, its motive nerve [mark that!], its bourgeois-democratic half, is
fit only to be chastised with scorpions.â In Lenin’s conception âof
Russian liberalism there was no room for such social elements on which the
Social-Democrats, in their role of vanguard of democracy, could at any

time 1!] 

exert their

      influence
 

Such is the new theory. Like all new theories of the present Iskra, it
is a complete muddle. In the first place, the claim to priority in the discovery
of intellectualist democracy is unfounded and absurd. Secondly, the differentiation made between Zemstvo liberalism and bourgeois democracy
is erroneous. Thirdly, the conception that the intelligentsia can become an
independent force does not hold water. Fourthly, the assertion that Zemstvo
liberalism (without its âbourgeois-democraticâ half) is fit only to
be chastised, etc., is unjust. Let us examine all these points.

 

Lenin is supposed to have ignored the birth of intellectualist democracy and
the third element.

and take the âReview of
Home Affairsâ which is quoted in Starover’s feuilleton. We read
the heading of the third section, âThe Third Elementâ. Throughout
this section we read about âthe increase in the numbers and in the
influence of such persons serving in the Zemstvos as doctors, technicians, and
so onâ; of âthe unsubmissive economic development ... which gives
rise to the need for intellectuals, who are becoming increasingly
numerousâ; of âthe inevitability of conflicts between these
intellectuals and the bureaucrats and administration bigwigsâ; of
âthe outright epidemic character of these conflicts latelyâ; of
âthe irreconcilability of autocracy with the interests of the
intelligentsia generallyâ. We read a direct appeal to these
elements to rally âto the bannerâ of Social-Democracy....


Quite a pretty account, wouldn’t one say? The newly discovered intellectualist
democracy and the need for rallying it to the banner of Social-Democracy were
âdiscoveredâ by that mischievous Lenin three years ago!


Of course, the antithesis between the Zemstvo men and the bourgeois
democrats had not yet been discovered at that time. But contraposing the two
would be just as rational as saying, âMoscow

      Gubernia[10]
and the
territory of the Russian Empireâ. Both the Zemstvo people, who believe in
qualified suffrage, and the Marshals of the Nobility are democrats, to
the extent that they oppose autocracy and serfdom. Their democratism is limited,
narrow, and inconsistent, just as any and all bourgeois democratism is in one or
another degree limited, narrow and inconsistent. The editorial in
Iskra, No. 77, analyses our liberals by dividing them into the
following groups: (1) serf-owning landlords; (2) liberal landlords; (3) the
liberal intelligentsia,

    

which stands for a constitution with qualified suffrage; and (4) the extreme
      Left—-the democratic intelligentsia. This analysis is incomplete and
      muddled, since the division of the intelligentsia is confounded with those
      of various classes and groups whose interests are expressed by the
      intelligentsia. Besides the interests of a broad section of The landlords,
      Russian bourgeois democratism reflects the interests of the mass of
      tradesmen and manufacturers, chiefly medium and small, as well as (and
      this is particularly important) those of the mass of proprietors and
      petty proprietors among the peasantry. The first flaw in Iskra’s
    analysis is its ignoring of this broadest section of Russia’s
    bourgeois-democratic sphere. The second flaw is its failure to see that the
    Russian democratic intelligentsia breaks up necessarily, not by accident,
    into three main trends corresponding to their political stand: the
    Osvobozhdeniye, the Socialist-Revolutionary, and the
    Social-Democratic. All these trends have a long history, and each expresses
    (as definitely as is possible in an autocratic state) the point of view of
    the moderate and the revolutionary ideologists of the bourgeois democrats
    and the point of view of the proletariat. Nothing could be more amusing than
    the innocent wish of the new Iskra that âthe democrats
    should act as an independent forceâ, while at the same time the democrats are identified with the radical intelligentsia! The new Iskra
    has forgotten that the radical intelligentsia or intellectual democratic
    movement, which has become âan independent forceâ, is none
      other than our âSocialist Revolutionary Partyâ! Our democratic
    intelligentsia could have no other âextreme Leftâ. It stands to
    reason, however, that one can speak of the independent force of
      such an intelligentsia only in the ironical or terrorist sense
      of the word. To stand
    on the same platform with the bourgeois democrats and move Leftward away
    from the Osvobozhdeniye means to move towards the
    Socialists-Revolutionaries, and in no other direction.


Finally, still less does the latest discovery of the new Iskra stand up
to criticism, namely, the discovery that âliberalism without its
bourgeois-democratic halfâ is fit only to be chastised with scorpions,
that âit is wiser to scrap the idea of hegemonyâ if there is no one
to turn to except

    

the Zemstvo people. Liberalism, of whatever kind, merits support by the
Social-Democrats only to the extent that it actually opposes the autocracy. It
is this support of all the inconsistent (i.e., bourgeois) democrats by the only
really consistent democrat (i.e., the proletariat) that makes the idea of
hegemony a reality. Only a petty-bourgeois huckster’s idea of hegemony can
conceive it as a compromise, mutual recognition, a matter of worded terms. From
the proletarian point of view hegemony in a war goes to him who fights most
energetically, who never misses a chance to strike a blow at the enemy, who
always suits the action to the word, who is therefore the ideological leader of
the democratic forces, who criticises half-way policies of every

kind.[11]

The new
Iskra is sadly mistaken if it thinks that half-heartedness is a moral
and not a politico-economic attribute of bourgeois democracy, if it thinks it
possible and necessary to fix such a degree of half-heartedness up to
which liberalism deserves only the scorpion’s lash and beyond which it
deserves agreements. This simply means âdetermining in advance the
permissible degree of basenessâ. Indeed, ponder the meaning of these
words:
to make it the term of an agreement with the opposition groups that they
recognise universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot means âto
present them with the infallible reagent of our demands, the litmus-paper test
of democracy, and to place the whole weight of the proletariat’s valuable
support on the scale of their political plansâ (No. 78). How prettily this
is put! And how one feels like saying to the author of these fine words, Starover: My dear friend, Arkady Nikolayevich, your fine words are wasted! Mr. Struve
rendered Starover’s infallible reagent ineffectual with a single stroke of the
pen when he wrote universal suffrage into the programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League. And the same Struve has proved to us in deeds on more than one
occasion that all these programmes are

    

mere scraps of paper as far as the liberals are concerned, not litmus-paper, but
      ordinary paper, since a bourgeois democrat thinks nothing of writing one
      thing today and another tomorrow. This is characteristic even of many
      bourgeois intellectuals who go over to the Social-Democrats. The entire
      history of European and Russian liberalism provides hundreds of instances
      wherein word and deed are at variance, which is why Starover’s desire to
      think up infallible paper reagents is so

naive. 


This naïve desire leads Starover to the great idea that supporting the
anti-tsarist struggle of bourgeois who do not agree to universal suffrage means
âbringing to nought the idea of universal suffrageâ! Perhaps Starover will
write us another

pretty[12]
feuilleton to prove that by supporting the
monarchists in their struggle against the autocracy we are reducing to nought
the âideaâ of a republic? The trouble is that Starover’s thoughts
revolve helplessly in a vicious circle of terms, slogans, demands, and
declarations, and overlook the only real criterion—the degree of actual
participation in the struggle. In practice, this inevitably results in
varnishing the radical intelligentsia with whom an âagreementâ is
declared to be possible. With disdain for Marxism, the intelligentsia is
declared to be the âmotive nerveâ (not the glib servant?) of
liberalism. The French and Italian radicals are honoured with the designation of
people to whom anti-democratic or anti-proletarian demands are alien, although
everyone knows that these radicals have betrayed their platforms and misled the
proletariat

    

 times out of number, although on the very next page
(p. 7) of the same issue of Iskra (No. 78) you may read that
the monarchists and the republicans in Italy were âat one in the fight
against socialismâ. The resolution of the Saratov intellectuals (the
Sanitary Service Society), pressing for participation of representatives of all
the people in legislative activities, is declared to be âthe real voice [!]
 of democracyâ (No. 77). The practical plan for proletarian
participation in the Zemstvo campaign is accompanied by the advice âto
enter into some agreement with the representatives of the Left Wing of the
oppositional bourgeoisieâ (the famous agreement not to create panic
fear). In answer to Lenin’s question, what had happened to Starover’s notorious
terms of agreement, the Editorial Board of the new Iskra wrote:



   âThese terms should always be present in the minds of Party
   members, and the latter, knowing on what conditions the Party consents to
   enter into formal political agreements with a democratic party, are morally
   bound, even in the case of local agreements referred to in the letter, to
   differentiate strictly between the reliable representatives of the
   bourgeois opposition—the real democrats, and the liberal

   milk-skimmers.â[13]



Step leads to step. In addition to Party agreements (the only permissible ones,
according to Starover’s resolution), local agreements have appeared in various
cities. Side by side with formal agreements, moral ones have appeared. It now
seems that verbal recognition of âtermsâ and their
âmoralâ binding force carries with it the title of a
âreliableâ and âreal democratâ, although every child
understands that hundreds of Zemstvo windbags would make any verbal statements
and even give the word of honour of a radical that they are
socialists—anything to keep the Social-Democrats quiet.

 

No, the proletariat will not be drawn into this game of slogans, declarations,
      and agreements. The proletariat will never forget that bourgeois democrats
      never make reliable democrats. The proletariat will support the bourgeois
      democrats, not on the basis of deals to abstain from creating panic fear,
      not on the basis of belief in their reliability, but when and to the
      extent that they actually struggle against the autocracy. Such support is
      necessary in the interests of achieving the independent social-revolutionary aims of the proletariat.

[11]

A note for a shrewd new-Iskrist. We shall probably be told that the
energetic struggle of the proletariat without any terms will
result in the theft of the fruits of victory by the bourgeoisie. Our reply
to this is the question: what possible guarantee can there be for the
fulfilment of the proletariat’s terms other than the independent force of
the proletariat?—Lenin

[12]

Another specimen of our Arkady Nikolayevich’s prose: âAnyone who has
been following public life in Russia during the last few years could not
have failed to note the growing democratic urge towards an untouched-up
concept of constitutional liberty stripped of all ideological trappings, of
all survivals of the historical past. This urge was, in a way, the
realisation of a long process of molecular changes within the democratic
trend, of its Ovidian metamorphoses, whose kaleidoscopic variety has held
the attention and interest of several successive generations over a period
of two decades.â A pity, indeed, that this is not true; for the idea of
liberty is not stripped, but, on the contrary, touched up with the idealism
of the latest philosophers of bourgeois democracy (Bulgakov, Berdayev,
Novgorodtsev, and others. See âProblems of Idealismâ and The New
Way). A pity, too, that all these kaleidoscopic Ovidian metamorphoses
of Starover, Trotsky, and Martov reveal an unadulterated urge for florid
phrases.—Lenin

[13]

See the second editorial, âA Letter to the Party Organisationsâ,
   likewise published secretly (âfor members of the Party onlyâ),
   although there is nothing secret about it. It is very instructive to
   compare this reply of the whole Editorial Board with Plekhanov’s
   âsecretâ pamphlet, On Our Tactics Towards the Struggle of the
   Liberal Bourgeoisie Against Tsarism (Geneva, 1905. A letter to the
   Central Committee. For Party members only). We hope to return to both
   these works.—Lenin
 



[14]

Narodism (from the word
narod—people)—a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian revolutionary
movement, which began to manifest itself in the sixties and seventies of the
nineteenth century. The Narodniks stood for the abolition of the autocracy and
the transfer of the landlords’ lands to the peasantry. At the same time, they
believed capitalism in Russia to be a fortuitous phenomenon with no prospect of
development, and they therefore considered the peasantry, and not the
proletariat, to be the main revolutionary force in Russia. They regarded the
village commune as the embryo of socialism. With the object of rousing the
peasantry to struggle against absolutism, the Narodniks âwent among the
peopleâ, to the village, but they found no support there. In the eighties
and nineties the Narodniks adopted a policy of conciliatoriness to tsarism, ex
pressed the interests of the kulak class, and waged a persistent
 fight against Marxism.





[15]

Narodnaya Volya members—participants in the
secret political organisation of the Narodnik terrorists called Narodnaya Volya
(The People’s Will), which came into being in August 1879 as a result of the
split in the Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom) secret society. The immediate aim
of the Narodnaya Volya was the over throw of the autocracy. Its programme called
for the organisation of âa permanent representative assembly of the
peopleâ elected on the basis of universal suffrage, the proclamation of
democratic liberties, transfer of the land to the people, and adoption of
measures for transferring the factories and mills to the workers. The Narodnaya
Volya members, however, failed to find a way to the broad masses and took the
path of political conspiracies and individual terrorism. Their terroristic
struggle was not supported by the revolutionary movement of the masses, and this
enabled the government to wreck the organisation by means of savage
persecutions,death sentences, and provocations.


After 1881 the Narodnaya Volya broke up. Abortive attempts to revive it were
made repeatedly in the course of the eighties. Thus, in 1886 a terrorist group
was formed, headed by A. I. Ulyanov (Lenin’s brother) and P. Y. Shevyryov, which
followed the traditions

   

 of the Narodnaya Volya. After the failure of the attempt to assassinate
Alexander III the group was discovered and its active members were executed.


While criticising their fallacious and utopian programme, Lenin thought highly
of the noble struggle of the Narodnaya Volya members against tsarism. In 1899,
in âA Protest by Russian Social Democratsâ, he pointed out that
âthe members of the old Narodnaya Volya managed to play an enormous role
in the history of Russia, despite the fact that only narrow social strata
supported the few heroes, and despite the fact that it was by no means a
revolutionary theory which served as the banner of the movementâ. (See
present
 edition, Vol. 4, p. 181.)

Legal Marxism—a bourgeois perversion of
Marxism, which originated in the nineties of the past century among the
bourgeois intellectuals. The âlegal Marxistsâ tried to make the labour
movement serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. While criticising the
Narodniks and acknowledging the capitalist path of development, the
âlegal
Marxistsâ denied the inevitability of capitalism’s downfall. They threw
out of the Marxian doctrine its most important tenet, the doctrine of the
proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of
 the proletariat.

ARTICLE ONE


A legal newspaper recently expressed the opinion that this is no time to dwell
on the âantagonismâ of interests among the different classes
opposing the autocracy. This opinion is not new. We have come across it, of
course, with reservations of one sort or other, in the columns of Osvobozhdeniye and Revolutsionnaya Rossiya. It is natural that such a
point of view should prevail among the representatives of the bourgeois
democrats. As far as the Social-Democrats are concerned, there can be no two
opinions among them on this question. The combined struggle of the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie against the autocracy must not and cannot make the
proletariat forget the antagonism of interests between it and the propertied
classes. To get a clear idea of this antagonism it is necessary to have a clear
idea of the profound differences that exist between the points of view of the
different trends. This does not imply, of course, that we should reject
temporary agreements with the adherents of other trends, both with the
Socialists-Revolutionaries and the liberals, such as the Second Congress of our
Party declared permissible for Social-Democrats.


The Social-Democrats consider the Socialists-Revolutionaries to be the
representatives of the extreme Left group of our bourgeois democracy. The
Socialists-Revolutionaries resent this opinion of them and regard it as a mean
attempt to humiliate an opponent and to question his sincerity and good
faith. Actually, such an opinion has nothing whatever to do with suspicion; it
is merely a Marxist definition of the class origin and the class nature

    

of the views of the Socialists-Revolutionaries. The more clearly and definitely
      the Socialists-Revolutionaries state their views, the more they confirm
      the Marxist characterisation of them. Of great interest in this respect
      is the draft programme of the Party of the Socialists-Revolutionaries
      published in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya, No. 46.


This draft is a considerable step forward, not only in relation to clarity of
exposition of principles. The progress is to be noted in the content of the
principles them selves, the progress from Narodism to Marxism, from democracy
to socialism. Our criticism of the Socialists-Revolutionaries has obviously
borne fruit; it has compelled them to lay particular stress on their socialist
good intentions and the views which they hold in common with Marxism. All the
more glaring, on the other hand, are the features of their old, Narodnik,
vaguely democratic views. We would remind those who are prone to accuse us of
being contradictory (recognising the socialist good intentions of the
Socialists-Revolutionaries, while defining their social nature as
bourgeois-democratic) that examples of socialism, not only of the
petty-bourgeois but of the bourgeois variety, were long ago analysed in the
Communist Manifesto. The good intentions of being a socialist do not
rule out a bourgeois-democratic essence.


A study of the draft reveals three main features of the Socialist-Revolutionary
world outlook. First, theoretical emendations of Marxism. Second, the survivals
of Narodism in their views of the labouring peasantry and the agrarian
question. Third, the same Narodnik survivals in their view of the impending
Russian revolution as non-bourgeois in character.


I said emendations of Marxism. Precisely. The whole main trend of
thought, the whole framework of the programme, points to the victory of Marxism
over Narodism. The latter is still alive (kept so with the aid of injections of
revisionism of the latest style), but only as partial âcorrectionsâ
of Marxism. Let us take the main general theoretical emendation, the theory of
the favourable and unfavourable relation between the positive and
negative sides of capitalism. This emendation, insofar as it is not completely
muddled, introduces the old Russian subjectivism

    

 into Marxism. The recognition of the âcreativeâ historical
activity of capitalism, which socialises labour and creates âa social
forceâ capable of transforming society, the force of the proletariat,
denotes a break with Narodism and a transition to Marxism. The theory
of socialism is founded on the objective development of economic
forces and of class
division. The emendation: âIn some branches of industry, especially
agriculture, and in en tire countriesâ the relation between the positive
and negative sides of capitalism âis becoming [how far they have gone!]
less and less favourableâ. This is a repetition of Hertz and
David, of Nik. —on,[1]

and of V. V. with his theory of the special
âdestinies of capitalism in Russiaâ. The backwardness of Russia in
general and of Russian agriculture in particular is no longer regarded as the
backwardness of capitalism, but as a uniqueness justifying backward
theories. Alongside the materialist conception of history we get the time-worn
view according to which the intelligentsia is capable of choosing more or less
favourable paths for the country and of becoming the supraclass judge of
capitalism, not the mouthpiece of the class that is begotten by capitalism’s
destruction of the old forms of life. The fact that capitalist exploitation in
Russia takes on particularly repellent forms because of the survival of pre-capitalist relations is overlooked in typical Narodnik fashion.


The Narodnik theory stands revealed still more clearly in the notions on the
peasantry. Throughout the draft the following words and phrases are used without
discrimination: the toilers, the exploited, the working class, the labouring
masses, the class of the exploited, the exploited classes. If the authors
stopped to think over the last term (âclassesâ), which escaped them
unguardedly, they would realise that it is the petty bourgeois as well as the
proletarians who work and are exploited under capitalism. What has been said of
the legal Narodniks can be said of our Socialists-Revolutionaries: to them goes
the honour of discovering an unheard-of type of capitalism without a petty
bourgeoisie. They speak of the labouring peasantry, but shut their eyes to a
fact which has been proved, studied, weighed, described, and pondered, namely,
that the

    

peasant bourgeoisie now definitely predominates among our labouring peasantry,
      and that the well-to-do peasantry, although entitled to the designation
      labouring peasantry, cannot get along without hiring farm-hands and
      already controls the better half of the peasantry’s productive forces.


Very odd, indeed, from this point of view, is the goal which the Party of the
Socialists-Revolutionaries has set itself in its minimum programme: âIn
the interests of socialism and of the struggle against bourgeois-proprietary
principles, to make use of the views, traditions, and modes of life of the
Russian peasantry, both as toilers in general and as members of the village
communes, particularly its conception of the land as being the common property
of all the toiling people.â This objective seems, at first blush, to be a quite
harmless, purely academic repetition of the village-commune utopias long since
refuted both by theory and life. In reality, however, we are dealing with a
pressing political issue which the Russian revolution promises to solve in the
very near future: Who will take advantage of whom? Will the revolutionary
intelligentsia, which believes itself to be socialist, utilise the toiler
conceptions of the peasantry in the interests of the struggle against
bourgeois-proprietary principles? Or will the bourgeois proprietary and at the
same time toiling peasantry utilise the socialist phraseology of the
revolutionary-democratic intelligentsia in the interests of the struggle against
socialism?


We are of the view that the second perspective will be realised (despite the
will and the consciousness of our opponents). We are convinced that it will be
realised because it has already nine-tenths been realised. The âbourgeois
proprietaryâ (and at the same time labouring) peasantry has already made
good use of the socialist phrases of the Narodnik, democratic intelligentsia,
which harboured illusions of sustaining âthe toiler traditions and modes
of lifeâ by means of its artels, co-operatives, fodder grass cultivation,
ploughs, Zemstvo warehouses, and banks, but which actually promoted the
development of capitalism within the village commune. Russian economic history
has thus proved what Russian political history will prove tomorrow. The
class-conscious proletariat has the duty to

    

explain to the rural proletarian, without in any way withholding support of the
progressive and revolutionary aspirations of the bourgeois labouring
peasantry, that a struggle against that peasantry is inevitable in the future;
it has the duty to explain to him the real aims of socialism, as opposed to the
bourgeois-democratic fancies of equalised land tenure. With the bourgeois
peasantry against the survivals of serfdom, against the autocracy, the priests,
and the landlords; with the urban proletariat against the bourgeoisie in general
and against the bourgeois peasantry in particular—this is the only correct
slogan for the rural proletarian, this is the only correct agrarian programme
for Russian Social-Democracy at the present moment. It was this programme that
our Second Congress adopted. With the peasant bourgeoisie for democracy, with
the urban proletariat for socialism—this slogan will have a far stronger
appeal to the rural poor than the showy but empty slogans of the
Socialist-Revolutionary dabblers in Narodism.


We come now to the third of the above-mentioned main points of the draft. Its
authors have by now broken with the view of the consistent Narodniks, who were
opposed to political freedom on the grounds that it could only result in turning
over power to the bourgeoisie. But the survivals of Narodism stand out very
clearly in the part of the draft which characterises the autocracy and the
attitude of the various classes towards it. Here too, as always, we see that the
very first attempts of the petty-bourgeois revolutionary intelligentsia to
clarify its conception of reality lead inevitably to the complete
exposure of its contradictory and superannuated views. (Let us, therefore,
remark, parenthetically, that disputes with the Socialists-Revolutionaries
should always be reduced to this very question of their conception of reality,
since this question alone clearly reveals the causes of our deep-seated
political divergence.)


âThe class of big, manufacturers and tradesmen, who are more reactionary
than anywhere else,â we read in the draft, âstands more and more in need
of the protection of the autocracy against the proletariatâ.... This is
false; for nowhere in Europe is the indifference of the advanced bourgeoisie
towards the autocratic form of rule so evident as

    

in our country. Discontent with the autocratic regime is growing among the
      bourgeoisie, regardless of its fear of the proletariat, in part simply
      because the police, for all its unlimited powers, cannot crush the
      working-class movement. In speaking of âa classâ of
    big manufacturers, the draft confounds the subdivisions and groups
    within the bourgeoisie with the entire bourgeoisie as a class. The in
    correctness is all the more patent in that it is precisely the middle and
    petty bourgeoisie that the autocracy is least of all capable of satisfying.


â...The landed nobility and the village kulaks stand more and more in need of such
support against the labouring masses in the villages....â Indeed? Where, then,
does Zemstvo liberalism come from? Whence the attraction for the enterprising
muzhik on the part of the uplift (democratic) intelligentsia and vice versa? Or
does the kulak have nothing in common with the enterprising muzhik?


â...An irreconcilable and growing antagonism is arising between the
existence of autocracy and the whole economic, social-political and cultural
development of the country....


In this they have reduced their own premises ad absurdum. Is it
possible to conceive of an âirreconcilable antagonismâ with the
entire economic, as well as other, growth of the country that would not be
reflected in the mood of the classes in economic command? It is one or the
other:
Either the autocracy is really incompatible with the economic
development of the country; in that case it is incompatible also with the
interests of the entire class of manufacturers, tradespeople,
landlords, and enterprising muzhiks. That this class has been controlling
âourâ economic development since 1861[2]

 is probably not unknown even to the
Socialists-Revolutionaries (although they were taught the contrary by
V. V.). That a government incompatible with the bourgeois class in general can
make capital out of the conflicts between the groups and strata of the
bourgeoisie, that it can make peace with the protectionists against the free
traders, enlist the support of one stratum against another, and keep up these
equilibristics for years and decades, is borne out by the whole trend of
European history. Or, in our country the manufacturers, the landlords,
and the peasant bourgeoisie âstand more

    

and more in needâ of the autocracy. In that case we should have to accept
the notion that they, the economic lords of the country, even taken as a whole,
as a class, do not understand the interests of the country’s economic development, that not even the advanced, educated and intelligent representatives and
leaders of these classes under stand these interests!


But would it not be simpler to accept the idea that it is our
Socialists-Revolutionaries who do not understand the situation? We need but see:
a little further on, they themselves admit âthe existence of a
liberal-democratic opposition, which embraces chiefly (in point of class) the
intermediate elements of the educated societyâ. But is our educated
society not a bourgeois society? Is it not bound by a thousand ties to the
tradesmen, manufacturers,

land lords, 

and enterprising muzhiks? Can God have
possibly ordained for Russia a capitalism in which the liberal-democratic
opposition is not a bourgeois-democratic opposition? Do the
Socialists-Revolutionaries know of any precedent in history or can they
conceive of any case in which the opposition of the bourgeoisie to the
autocratic regime was not or would not be expressed through
the liberal, educated âsocietyâ?


The muddle in the draft is the inevitable outcome of confounding Narodism with
Marxism. Only Marxism has given a scientifically correct analysis, confirmed
more and more by reality, of the relation between the struggle for democracy and
the struggle for socialism. We, like the rest of the world, have bourgeois
democratism and working-class democratism. With us, as with the rest of the
world, the Social-Democrats must expose mercilessly the inevitable illusions of
the bourgeois democrats and their ignorance of their own nature. With us, as
with the rest of the world, the class-conscious proletariat must support the
bourgeois democrats in their opposition to the survivals of serfdom and their
struggle against them, against the autocracy, without forgetting for an instant
that it is a class by itself, and that it has as its class aim the overthrow of
the bourgeoisie.

The strike that began at the Putiloy Works on January 3 is developing into one
of the most imposing manifestations of the working-class movement. Our
information so far is limited to reports in the foreign newspapers and the legal
Russian press. But even these sources leave no doubt that the strike has already
become a political event of tremendous importance.


The strike started quite spontaneously. It was one of the clashes between
labour and capital that are ever recurring. This time the impetus was the
dismissal of four workers by the factory management. The workers rose in a high
spirit of solidarity and demanded their reinstatement. The movement gained
rapidly. The legally functioning Russian Factory and Mill Workers’ Society is
taking part in it, and the strike is entering its next and higher phase.


This legal workers’ society has been an object of special attention on the part
of the Zubatovists.[2]

And now the Zubatov movement is
outgrowing its bounds. Initiated by the police in the interests of the police,
in the interests of supporting the autocracy and demoralising the political
consciousness of the workers, this movement is turning against the autocracy and
is becoming an outbreak of the proletarian, class struggle.


The Social-Democrats long ago predicted that such would be the
inevitable outcome of the, Zubatov movement in our country. The legalisation of
the working-class movement, they said, would definitely benefit us Social-Democrats. It would draw certain sections of the workers into the movement,
especially the backward sections; it would

    

help to rouse those who would not soon, perhaps ever, be roused by a socialist
agitator. And once drawn into the movement and having acquired an interest in
their own future, the workers would go further. The legal labour movement would
only be a new and broader basis for the Social-Democratic labour

      movement.[1]


Without a doubt, this is precisely what happened in St. Petersburg.


The movement owes its rapid expansion to two circumstances: first, the moment
was propitious for an economic struggle (the government was in pressing need of
the fulfilment of the orders placed by the War Ministry and the Admiralty);
secondly, the constitutional movement among the social strata was
expanding. Having begun the strike in defence of some dismissed comrades, the
workers took the further step of presenting broad economic demands. They
demanded an eight-hour day, a minimum wage (one ruble for men and seventy kopeks
for women), the abolition of compulsory overtime work (and double pay for
overtime), improvement of sanitary conditions and medical aid, etc. The strike
began to develop into a general strike.


The foreign papers report under date of Saturday, January 8 (21, new style),
that even according to official Russian information 174 mills, factories, and
workshops involving 96,000 workers are on strike.


We are witnessing one of the great clashes between the developing proletarian
class and its enemies, clashes that will leave their mark for many years to
come.


But things did not stop at economic demands. The movement has begun to assume a
political character. The local Social-Democrats have attempted (although, it
seems, still very feebly) to participate in it. At huge mass meetings of the
workers attended by several thousand people political demands have come to be
discussed and resolutions in favour of political freedom have been put to the
vote. The petition drawn up by the workers, it is reported, comprises
three parts.[3]

 The first sets forth demands of

    

rights for the people; the second, measures to relieve the people’s poverty; the
      third, measures against the oppression of labour by capital. The first
      part contains the following demands: inviolability of the person; freedom
      of speech, assembly, and conscience; compulsory schooling at the expense
      of the state; participation of elected representatives of the people in
      the legislature; equality of all before the law; a responsible Cabinet;
      abolition of the redemption payments[4];

cheap credit;
    gradual sharing out of the state lands among the people; an income-tax. (If
    this report is true, it points to an extremely interesting interpretation of
    the Social-Democratic programme in the minds of the masses or their not very
    class-conscious leaders.) The correspondent of The Standard, an
    English newspaper, reports that three meetings took place on January 5 (18)
    (of which one was attended by 4,000 and an other by 2,000) and that the
    following political demands were endorsed: (1) the immediate convocation of
    a Constituent Assembly elected by a general vote; (2) an end to the war;
    (3) full amnesty for political exiles and prisoners; (4) freedom of the
    press and of conscience; (5) freedom of assembly and the right of
    association. The foreign press for January 8 (21) reports that preparations
    are under way for a demonstration to be held on Sunday, January 9 (22),
    outside the Winter Palace, at which a petition is to be presented âto
    the tsar himselfâ. Freedom or death, declare the workers. Moscow and
    Libau are sending workers’ delegates to St. Petersburg.


Such is the limited and still unconfirmed information to have reached us to
date. Obviously the movement has not yet attained its zenith by far, and we must
await further events before we can form a definite opinion of what is
occurring. One is struck by the amazingly rapid shift of the movement from the
purely economic to the political ground, by the tremendous solidarity and
energy displayed by hundreds of thousands of proletarians—and all this,
notwithstanding the fact that conscious Social-Democratic influence is lacking
or is but slightly evident. The primitive character of the socialist views held
by some of the leaders of the movement and the tenacity with which some elements
of the working class cling to their naive faith in

    

the tsar enhance rather than lessen the significance of the revolutionary
instinct now asserting itself among the proletariat. The political protest of
the leading oppressed class and its revolutionary energy break through all
obstacles, both external, in the form of police bans, and internal, in the form
of the ideological immaturity and backwardness of some of the leaders. The work
of the Social-Democrats during the last ten years and the lessons of the
working-class movement during this period have borne fruit; the ideas of
socialism and of the political struggle are streaming through the broadest
channels. The proletariat is proving in action that on the political scene in
Russia there are not only two forces (autocracy and bourgeois society), as some
in their faintness of heart have been ready to believe. It is showing us
manifestly superior forms of mobilisation of the revolutionary class forces;
this mobilisation, of course, is not to be classed with demonstrations of minor
importance in this or that municipal council, but with mass movements, like the
Rostov demonstration and the strikes of 1903 in the South. The mobilisation of
the revolutionary forces of the proletariat in this new and higher form is
bringing us with gigantic strides nearer to the moment when the proletariat will
even more decisively and more consciously join battle with the autocracy.

Issue No. 83 of Iskra, which we have just received, contains a
declaration by the Mensheviks and the Central Committee concerning âthe
complete cessation of the Minority’s organisational
separatenessâ. âThe Minority,â we are assured, âceases to
consider itself a camp, and there can be no further question of either
boycotting the Central Committee or presenting ultimatums to it.â This
statement comes just a wee bit late! The Party now knows from Lenin’s pamphlet
(Statement and Documents on the Break of the Central Institutions with the

      Party[1]

)

that the âultimatumsâ to co-opt Popov, Fisher, and
Fomin have already been enforced, to be sure, on the quiet, by
deception of the Party. The ultimatum to sabotage the Third Congress
through similar deceptions has also been enforced. The disorganisation of local
work is continuing, and the so-called Central Committee has approved the
setting-up in St. Petersburg (by the report in Iskra) of âa
special organisationâ or group, in view of the fact that its
numerous [?] members are obviously unable to work under the leadership of the
local committeeâ.


And so, what the âMajorityâ said and predicted, beginning with
Lenin’s âLetterâ (âWhy I Resigned from the Iskra
Editorial Boardâ, December

1903[2]

)

 and ending with Orlovsky’s pamphlet
The Council Against the Party, has now been wholly and
unquestionably confirmed by events. The actual object of the eighteen
months’ struggle was the co-optation of four to the Central Organ and three to

    

the Central Committee. For the sake of co-optation the organisation-as-process
theory and a heap of differences âon points of principleâ were
concocted. For the sake of this co-optation our centres have now broken
completely with the Party and are breaking with the local committees
piecemeal. The correctness of our slogan that âthe Majority must break
off all relations with the disorganisersâ (Vperyod, No. 1,
âTime to Call a

Halt!â[3]

)

is now fully confirmed.


Extremely interesting, too, is the following passage from the Iskra
statement: âThe decision of the delegates [of the Minority] was submitted
for discussion to all the adherents of the Minority working in the Kiev,
Kharkov, Don, Kuban, St. Petersburg, and Odessa committees, the Donets and
Crimean leagues, and other Party organisations.â Thus, after a furious campaign
of nearly eighteen months, the circle abroad, with the aid of the
Central Organ, the Council, and (since May) the Central Committee, won to its
side only five Russian committees out of the twenty attending the Second

   Congress![4]

Outside the committees, sizable groups considered worthy of
being listed in Iskra were set up in only two cities, in St. Petersburg
and in Odessa. The Kuban Committee, apparently, was only recently knocked
together for the sake of an extra pair of votes.


Consequently, Iskra, the organ of the Minority, now, in January,
confirms the correctness of the analysis of the Party situation which another
Menshevik gave in September. It was the agent of the Central Committee, sympathising with the Minority and now co-opted to the C.C., who wrote in September
to

      Glebov,[5]

a member of the C.C.,

    

that âin Russia the Minority is powerlessâ, that it is
    backed by only four committees. It was this powerlessness of the
    circle abroad that made it engineer the Bonapartist coup in the C.C. and
    side-track, by deceit, the Third Congress.

Of the committees attending the Congress only the Kiev Committee went
over from the Majority to the Minority, i.e., at the Congress both its
delegates were Bolsheviks, but now in the committee the Mensheviks
predominate. In the Nikolayev and Siberian committees, on the contrary,
both delegates to the Congress were Mensheviks, but after the Congress
these committees sided with the Majority. The Odessa, Don, Ufa, and Moscow
committees were divided at the Congress between the Majority and the
Minority (one delegate in each). Of these only the Don Committee is now
Menshevist.—Lenin

Geneva, Wednesday, January 25 (12)


Events of the greatest historical importance are developing in Russia. The
proletariat has risen against tsarism. The proletariat was driven to revolt by
the government. There can hardly be any doubt now that the government
deliberately allowed the strike movement to develop and a wide demonstration to
be started more or less without hindrance in order to bring matters to a point
where military force could be used. Its manoeuvre was successful. Thousands of
killed and wounded—such is the toll of Bloody Sunday, January 9, in
St. Petersburg. The army defeated unarmed workers, women, and children. The army
vanquished the enemy by shooting prostrate workers. âWe have taught them
a good lesson!â the tsar’s henchmen and their European flunkeys from
among the conservative bourgeoisie say with consummate cynicism.


Yes, it was a great lesson, one which the Russian proletariat will not
forget. The most uneducated, backward sections of the working class, who naïvely
trusted the tsar and sincerely wished to put peacefully before âthe tsar
himselfâ the petition of a tormented people, were all taught a lesson by
the troops led by the tsar or his uncle, the Grand Duke Vladimir.


The working class has received a momentous lesson in civil war; the
revolutionary education of the proletariat made more progress in one day than it
could have made in months and years of drab, humdrum, wretched existence. The
slogan of the heroic St. Petersburg proletariat, âDeath or freedom!â is
reverberating throughout Russia. Events

    

are developing with astonishing rapidity. The general strike in St. Petersburg
      is spreading. All industrial, public, and political activities are
      paralysed. On Monday, January 10, still more violent clashes occurred
      between the workers and the military. Contrary to the mendacious
      government reports, blood is flowing in many parts of the capital. The
      workers of Kolpino are rising. The proletariat is arming itself and the
      people. The workers are said to have seized the Sestroretsk Arsenal. They
      are providing themselves with revolvers, forging their tools into weapons,
      and procuring bombs for a desperate bid for freedom. The general strike is
      spreading to the provinces. Ten thousand have already ceased work in
      Moscow, and a general strike has been called there for tomorrow (Thursday,
      January 13). An uprising has broken out in Riga. The workers are demonstrating in Lodz, an uprising is being prepared in Warsaw,
      proletarian demonstrations are taking place in Helsingfors. Unrest is
      growing among the workers and the strike is spreading in Baku, Odessa,
      Kiev, Kharkov, Koyno, and Vilna. In Sevastopol, the naval stores and
      arsenals are ablaze, and the troops refuse to shoot at the
      mutineers. Strikes in Revel and in Saratov. Workers and reservists clash
      with the troops in Radom.


The revolution is spreading. The government is beginning to lose its head. From
the policy of bloody repression it is attempting to change over to economic
concessions and to save itself by throwing a sop to the workers or promising the
nine-hour day. But the lesson of Bloody Sunday cannot be forgotten. The demand
of the insurgent St. Petersburg workers—the immediate convocation of a
Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage by
secret ballot—must become the demand of all the striking
workers. Immediate overthrow of the government— this was the slogan with
which even the St. Petersburg workers who had believed in the tsar answered the
massacre of January 9; they answered through their leader, the priest Georgi
Gapon, who declared after that bloody day: âWe no longer have a tsar. A
river of blood divides the tsar from the people. Long live the fight for
freedom!â


Long live the revolutionary proletariat! say we. The general strike is rousing
and rallying increasing masses

    

of the working class and the urban poor. The arming of the people is becoming an
immediate task of the revolutionary moment.


Only an armed people can be the real bulwark of popular liberty. The sooner the
proletariat succeeds in arming, and the longer it holds its fighting positions
as striker and revolutionary, the sooner will the army begin to waver; more and
more soldiers will at last begin to realise what they are doing and they will
join sides with the people against the fiends, against the tyrant, against the
murderers of defenceless workers and of their wives and children. No matter
what the outcome of the present uprising in St. Petersburg may be, it will, in
any case, be the first step to a wider, more conscious, better organised
uprising. The government may possibly succeed in putting off the day of
reckoning, but the postponement will only make the next step of the
revolutionary onset more stupendous. This will only mean that the
Social-Democrats will take advantage of this postponement to rally the
organised fighters and spread the news about the start made by the
St. Petersburg workers. The proletariat will join in the struggle, it will quit
mill and factory and will prepare arms for itself. The slogans of the struggle
for freedom will be carried more and more widely into the midst of the urban
poor and of the millions of peasants. Revolutionary committees will be set up
at every factory, in every city district, in every large village. The people
in revolt will overthrow all the government institutions of the tsarist autocracy
and proclaim the immediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly.


The immediate arming of the workers and of all citizens in general, the
preparation and organisation of the revolutionary forces for overthrowing the
government authorities and institutions—this is the practical basis on
which revolutionaries of every variety can and must unite to strike the common
blow. The proletariat must always pursue its own independent path, never
weakening its connection with the Social-Democratic Party, always bearing in
mind its great, ultimate objective, which is to rid mankind of all
exploitation. But this independence of the Social Democratic proletarian party
will never cause us to forget the importance of a common revolutionary onset at
the

    

moment of actual revolution. We Social-Democrats can and must act
independently of the bourgeois-democratic revolutionaries and guard the
class independence of the proletariat. But we must go hand in hand with
them during the

up rising, 

when direct blows are being struck at tsarism, when resistance is offered
the troops, when the bastilles of the accursed enemy of the entire Russian
people are stormed.  

The proletariat of the whole world is now looking eagerly towards the
proletariat of Russia. The overthrow of tsarism in Russia, so valiantly begun
by our working class, will be the turning-point in the history of all countries;
it will facilitate the task of the workers of all nations, in all states, in all
parts of the globe. Let, therefore, every Social-Democrat, every
class-conscious worker bear in mind the immense tasks of the broad popular
struggle that now rest upon his shoulders. Let him not forget that he represents
also the needs and interests of the whole peasantry, of all who toil, of all
who are exploited, of the whole people against their enemy. The proletarian
heroes of St. Petersburg now stand as an example to all.

Long live the revolution!
Long live the insurgent proletariat!

Revolutionary Days



    
 

1
What Is Happening in Russia?

Revolt or revolution? This is the question that European journalists and
reporters have been asking themselves in connection with the events in
St. Petersburg, which they are reporting to the whole world and attempting to
evaluate. Are they rebels or insurgents—the tens of thousands of
proletarians against whom the tsarist army successfully took the field? And the
foreign papers, though sooner in a position to view the events with
“detachment”, with the impartiality of chroniclers, find it
difficult to answer the question. They are constantly getting their terms
mixed. And small wonder. It is not without reason that a revolution is said to
be a successful revolt, and a revolt an unsuccessful revolution. People who
witness the beginning of great and momentous events, who can obtain only very
incomplete, inexact, and third-hand information of what is taking place, will
not, of course, hazard a definite opinion until a timelier moment comes. The
bourgeois papers, which continue as of old to speak of revolt, rioting, and
disturbances, cannot help seeing the truly national, nay, international,
significance of these events. Yet it is this significance which invests events
with the character of revolution. And those who have been writing of the last
days of the rioting find themselves involuntarily referring to them as the first
days of the revolution. A turning-point in Russia’s history has been
reached. This is not denied even by the most hidebound of European
conservatives, however enthusiastic and. sentimental they may wax over the
mighty, unrestricted power of the all-Russian autocracy. Peace between the
autocracy and the people is unthinkable. Revolution is not only in the mouths of
a few fearless souls, not only of “nihilists”—as Europe persists in
calling the Russian revolutionaries—but of every person capable of taking
any interest in world politics.

 

The Russian working-class movement has risen to a higher level in the last few
      days. It is developing before our very eyes into a national
      uprising. Naturally, here in Geneva, so damnably far away, we find it
      exceedingly difficult to keep pace with events. But so long as we have to
      linger at such an accursed distance, we must try to keep pace with events,
      to sum them up, to draw conclusions, to draw from the experience of
      today’s happenings lessons that will be useful tomorrow, in another place,
      where today “the people are still mute” and where in the near
      future, in some form or other, a revolutionary conflagration will break
      out. We must make it the constant job of publicists to write the history
      of the present day, and to try to write it in such a way that our
      chronicles will give the greatest possible help to the direct participants
      in the movement and to the heroic proletarians there, on the scene of
      action—to write it in such a way as to promote the spread of the
      movement, the conscious selection of the means, ways, and methods of
      struggle that, with the least expenditure of effort, will yield the most
      substantial and permanent results.


In the history of revolutions there come to light contradictions that have
ripened for decades and centuries. Life becomes unusually eventful. The masses,
which have always stood in the shade and have therefore often been ignored and
even despised by superficial observers, enter the political arena as active
combatants. These masses are learning in practice, and before the eyes. of the
world are taking their first tentative steps, feeling their way, defining their
objectives, testing themselves and the theories of all their ideologists. These
masses are making heroic efforts to rise to the occasion and cope with the
gigantic tasks of world significance imposed upon them by history; and however
great individual defeats may be, however shattering to us the rivers of blood
and the thousands of victims, nothing will ever compare in importance with this
direct training that the masses and the classes receive in the course of the
revolutionary struggle itself. The history of this struggle is measured in
days. And for good reason some foreign news papers have already started a
“diary of the Russian revolution”. Let us, too, start one.

Father Gapon

That Father Gapon is an agent-provocateur is a surmise that would seem
to be borne out by the fact that he is a member and one of the ringleaders of
the Zubatov society. Furthermore, the foreign newspapers, like our own
correspondents, note the fact that the police deliberately allowed the strike
movement to spread as widely and freely as possible, and that the government
generally (and Grand Duke Vladimir in particular) wanted to provoke
bloody reprisals under conditions most favourable to itself. The English
correspondents even point out that the energetic participation of the
Zubatovists in the movement could only have been of especial advantage to the
government under the circumstances. The revolutionary intelligentsia and the
class-conscious proletarians, who would have been the most likely to provide
themselves with arms, were bound to keep aloof from the Zubatov movement, to
give it a wide berth. The government thus had its hands free to play a winning
game. The demonstration, so they reckoned, would be made up of the most
peaceful, least organised, and most back ward workers; it would be child’s play
for our soldiery to handle them, and the proletariat would be taught a whole
some lesson; an excellent excuse would be furnished for shooting down anybody
and everybody in the streets; at Court the victory of the reactionary (or Grand
Ducal) party over the liberals would be complete; the harshest repressions
would follow.


Both the English and the conservative German newspapers directly ascribe such a
plan of action to the government (or to Vladimir). It is most likely true. The
events of the bloody Ninth of January confirm this only too well.

    

But the existence of such a plan by no means rules out the possibility that
      Father Gapon was an unconscious instrument of this plan. That
    there is a liberal, reformative movement among certain sections of the young
    Russian clergy cannot be doubted; this movement has found its spokesmen both
    at meetings of the religio-philosophic society and in church
    publications. It has even been given a name of its own— the
    “New-Orthodox” movement. We cannot, therefore, flatly dismiss
    the idea that Father Gapon may be a sincere Christian Socialist and that it
    was Bloody Sunday which converted him to the truly revolutionary path. We
    are inclined to support this idea, especially since Gapon’s letters written
    after the massacre of January 9 declaring that “we have no
    tsar”, his call to fight for freedom, etc., are facts that speak for
    his honesty and sincerity; for it could not possibly be part of the duties
    of an agent-provocateur to agitate so powerfully for the
    continuation of the uprising.


However that may be, the policy of the Social-Democrats in regard to this new
leader was self-evident: to maintain a careful, guarded, sceptical attitude
towards this Zubatovist; in any case, to participate vigorously in the
initiated strike movement (even though it was initiated by a Zubatovist); to
popularise energetically the Social-Democratic views and slogans. As appears
from the letters printed above, these have been the tactics followed by our
comrades on the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.[1]

“Cunning” as the plans of the reactionary Court clique may
have been, the realities of the class struggle and of the political protest of
the proletarians acting as the vanguard of the whole people have proved
infinitely more so. That the plans of the police and the military have worked
against the government, that out of the Zubatov movement, which served as a
minor cause, there has emerged a great and extensive revolutionary movement
embracing all Russia, is an established fact. Despite all police snares and
stratagems, the revolutionary energy and the revolutionary instinct of the
working class have asserted themselves with irresistible force.

The Plan of the St. Petersburg Battle

It seems strange, at first glance, to refer to the peaceful march of unarmed
workers to present a petition as a battle. It was a massacre. But the government
had looked forward to a battle, and it doubtlessly acted according to
a well-laid plan.  It considered the defence of St. Petersburg and of
the Winter Palace
from the military standpoint. It took all necessary military measures. It
removed all the civil authorities, and placed the capital with its million and
a half population under the complete control of the generals (headed by Grand
Duke Vladimir), who were thirsting for the blood of the people.


The government deliberately drove the proletariat to revolt, provoked it, by the
massacre of unarmed people, to erect barricades, in order to drown the uprising
in a sea of blood. The proletariat will learn from these military lessons
afforded by the government. For one thing, it will learn the art of civil war,
now that it has started the revolution. Revolution is war. Of all the wars
known in his tory it is the only lawful, rightful, just, and truly great
war. This war is not waged in the selfish interests of a handful of rulers and
exploiters, like any and all other wars, but in the interests of the masses of
the people against the tyrants, in the interests of the toiling and exploited
millions upon millions against despotism and violence.


All detached observers now are of one accord in admitting that in Russia this
war has been declared and begun. The proletariat will rise again in still
greater masses. What is left of the childish faith in the tsar will now vanish
as quickly as the St. Petersburg workers changed from

    

petitioning to barricade fighting. The workers everywhere will arm. What matters
      it that the police will keep a tenfold greater watch over the arsenals and
      arms stores and shops? No stringencies, no prohibitions will stop the
      masses in the cities, once they have come to realise that without arms
      they can always be shot down by the government on the slightest
      pretext. Everyone will try his hardest to get him self a gun or at least a
      revolver, to conceal his fire-arms from the police and be ready to repel
      any attack of the blood thirsty servitors of tsarism. Every beginning is
      difficult, as the saying goes. It was very difficult for the workers to go
      over to the armed combat.The government has now forced them to it. The
      first and most difficult step has been taken.


An English correspondent reports a typical conversation among workers in a
Moscow street. A group of workers was openly discussing the lessons of the
day. “Hatchets?” said one. “No, you can’t do anything with a hatchet
against a sabre. You can’t get at him with a hatchet any more than you can with
a knife. No, what we need is revolvers, revolvers at the very least, and better
still, guns.” Such conversations can be heard now all over Russia. And these
conversations after “Vladimir’s Day” in St. Petersburg will not
remain mere talk.


The military plan of the tsar’s uncle, Vladimir, who directed the massacre, was
to keep the people from the suburbs, the workers’ suburbs, away from the centre
of the city. No pains were spared to make the soldiers believe that the workers
wanted to demolish the Winter Palace (by means of icons, crosses, and
petitions!) and kill the tsar. The strategic task was simply to guard the
bridges and the main streets leading to the Palace Square. And the principal
scenes of “military operations” were the squares near the bridges
(the Troitsky, Samsonievsky, Nikolayevsky, and Palace bridges), as well as the
streets leading from the working-class districts to the centre (the Narvskaya
Zastava, Schlüsselburg Highway, and Nevsky Prospekt), and, lastly, the Palace
Square itself, to which thousands upon thousands of workers penetrated in spite
of the massed troops and the resistance they met with. Military operations were,
of course, rendered much easier by the fact that everybody

    

knew perfectly well where the workers were going, that there was but one
rallying point and one. objective. The valiant generals attacked
“successfully” an enemy who had come unarmed and made his
destination and purpose known in advance...: It was a dastardly, cold-blooded
massacre of defenceless and peaceful people. For a long time to come new the
masses will think over and re live in memory and in story all that took
place. The sole and inevitable conclusion drawn from these reflections, from the
assimilation of “Vladimir’s lesson” in the minds of the masses, will
be à la guerre comme à la guerre. The working-class masses, and,
following their lead, the masses of the rural poor, will realise that they are
combatants in a war, and then ... then the next battles of our civil war will be
fought according to plan, but no longer according to the “plan” of
grand dukes and the tsars. The call “To arms!” which sounded among a crowd
of workers in Nevsky Prospekt on January 9 cannot die away now without
reverberation.

The plan of the St. Petersburg battle was described by us in
Vperyod,

No. 4.[1]

The English newspapers now give us some details
of this plan which are not without interest. The Grand Duke Vladimir appointed
General Prince Vasilchikov Commander of the Army in the Field. The entire
capital was split up into areas among the officers.The tsar played at war quite
seriously, as though confronted by the invasion of an armed foe. During the
military operations the General Staff sat round a green-topped table on
Vasilyevsky Island, receiving reports from every area commander at half-hour
intervals.

“Our Father the Tsar” and the Barricades

In reviewing the events of Bloody Sunday one is struck by the combination of
naive patriarchal faith in the tsar and the fierce armed street fighting against
the tsarist rule. The first day of the Russian revolution brought the old Russia
and the new face to face with startling force and showed the death agony of the
peasants’ age-old faith in “Our Father the Tsar”, and the birth of a
revolutionary people, the urban proletariat. No wonder the European bourgeois
newspapers say that Russia of January 10 is no longer the Russia of January
8. No wonder the cited German Social—Democratic newspaper[1]

recalls how
seventy years ago the working-class movement started in England, how in 1834 the
English workers held street demonstrations to protest against the banning of the
trade unions, how in 1838 they drew up the “People’s Charter” at
monster meetings near Manchester, and how Parson Stephens proclaimed
“the right, of every man that breathes God’s free air and treads upon
God’s free earth to have his home and hearth.” And the same parson called on the
assembled workers to take up arms.


Here, in Russia, too, a priest found himself at the head of the movement; one
day he appealed for a march with a peaceful petition to the tsar himself, and
the next day he issued a call for revolution. “Comrades, Russian workers!”
Father Georgi Gapon wrote, after that bloody day, in a letter read at a meeting
of liberals. “We no longer have a tsar. Today a river of blood divides him
from the Russian people. It is time for the Russian workers to begin the
struggle for the people’s freedom without him. For today I give

    

you my blessing. Tomorrow I shall be with you. Today I am busy working for our
cause.”


This is not Father Georgi Gapon speaking. This is the voice of those thousands
upon thousands, of those millions upon millions of Russian workers and peasants
who until now could believe naively and blindly in the Tsar Father and seek
alleviation of their unbearable lot from Our Father the Tsar
“himself”, who put the blame for all the atrocities and outrages,
the tyranny and plunder, only on the officials that were deceiving the
tsar. Generation after generation of downtrodden, half-civilised, rustic
existence cut off from the world tended to strengthen this faith. Every month of
life of the new, urban, industrial, literate Russia has been undermining and
destroying this faith. The past decade of the working-class movement
has produced thousands of advanced proletarian Social-Democrats who
have consciously
broken with this faith. It has educated scores of thousands of workers in whom
the class instinct, strengthened in the strike movement and fostered by
political agitation, has shattered this faith to its foundations. Behind these
scores of thousands, however, stood hundreds of thousands, millions, of toiling
and exploited people, proletarians and semi-proletarians, suffering every insult
and indignity, in whom this faith could still survive. They were not ready for
revolt, they could only beg and plead. Their feelings and their mood, their
level of knowledge and political experience were expressed by Father Georgi
Gapon; herein lies the historic significance of the role played at the beginning
of the Russian revolution by a man who, but yesterday unknown, has today become
the hero of the hour in St. Petersburg and, as a result, in the entire European
press.


It is clear now why the St. Petersburg Social-Democrats, whose letters we
quoted above, at first treated Gapon, as they could not help doing, with
distrust. A man who wore the cassock, who believed in God and acted under the
august patronage of Zubatov and the secret police, could not but arouse
suspicion. Whether he was sincere or not in rending his cassock and cursing the
fact that he belonged to that vile social-estate, the priesthood, which robs and
demoralises the people, no one could say with

    

certainty, beyond those who knew him well personally, that is, a mere
handful. Only the course of historical events could decide this, only facts,
facts, facts. And the facts decided in Gapon’s favour.


Will Social-Democracy be able to gain the lead of this spontaneous movement? our
St. Petersburg comrades asked themselves with concern, seeing the swift
irresistible growth of the general strike, which is involving unusually broad
strata of the proletariat, seeing the magnetism of Gapon’s influence on the
“backward” masses who were so ignorant that they could be swept off
their feet even by an agent-provocateur. And the Social-Democrats not
only did not encourage any naive illusions with regard to the possibility of
peaceful petitioning but, on the contrary, opposed Gapon in argument, openly
and firmly defending all their views and their tactical line. History, which the
working-class masses were making without Social-Democracy, has confirmed the
correctness of these views and the tactical line. The logic of the proletariat’s
class position proved stronger than Gapon’s mistakes, naïvetés, and
illusions. Grand Duke Vladimir, acting on behalf of the tsar and invested with
all the power of the tsar, undertook by his executioner’s exploit to demonstrate
to the working-class masses the very thing that the Social-Democrats have
always demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate to them through the printed
and spoken word.


The masses of workers and peasants who still retained a vestige of faith in the
tsar were not ready for insurrection, we said. After January 9 we have the right
to say that now they are ready for insurrection and will rise. By his massacre
of unarmed workers “Our Father the Tsar” himself has driven them to
the barricades and given them their first lessons in barricade fighting. The
lessons of “Our Father the Tsar” will not be lost.


It remains for the Social-Democrats to see to it that the news of the bloody
days in St. Petersburg is spread as far and as wide as possible; to rally and
organise their forces still better and popularise still more energetically the
slogan they have long since advanced: general armed uprising of
the people.

The First Steps

The fire was sparked off by a quite ordinary clash between labour and
capital—a strike at a factory. It is interesting to note, however, that
this strike of twelve thousand Putilov workers, which broke out on Monday,
January 3, was before everything a strike in the name of proletarian
solidarity. It was caused by the dismissal of four workers. “When the
demand for their reinstatement was turned down,” writes a comrade from
St. Petersburg on January 7, “the factory struck work immediately to a
man. The strike is fully disciplined. The workers put several men to protect
the machines and other property against possible damage by the less
class-conscious workers. They then sent a delegation to other factories to
communicate to them their demands and to ask them to join the strike.” Many
thousands of workers began to join the movement. The legal Zubatov workers’
society, sponsored by the government in order to demoralise the proletariat by
systematic monarchist propaganda, rendered no little service in organising the
movement in its early stages and in extending it. What happened was something
that the Social-Democrats had long pointed out to the Zubatovists, namely, that
the revolutionary instinct of the working class and the spirit of solidarity
would prevail over all petty police ruses. The most backward workers would be
drawn into the movement by the Zubatovists, and then the tsarist government
would itself take care to drive the workers farther; capitalist exploitation
itself would turn them away from the peaceable and out-and-out hypocritical
Zubatov fold towards revolutionary Social-Democracy. The practice of
proletarian life and proletarian struggle would prove superior

    

to all the “theories” and all the vain efforts of the Zubatov

       gentry.[1]


And that is what has happened. One comrade, a worker and member of the
St. Petersburg Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, gives
his impressions as follows in a letter addressed to us under date of January 5.


“I am writing under the fresh impression of a meeting of workers of the
Semyannikov Shipyard just held at the Nevskaya Zastava. But first, a word about
the feeling among the St. Petersburg workers. As you know, ’Zubatov’
organisations have lately begun to crop up here, or rather are being revived
under the leadership of the priest Gapon. These organisations have grown
considerably in number and strength in a very short time. There are now 11
branches of the so-called Russian Factory Workers’ Assembly. As was to be
expected, the results of these meetings were inevitably the same as in the
South.


“We can now say with certainty that a sweeping strike movement is
starting in St. Petersburg. Almost every day you hear of a new strike at one or
another factory. The Putilov Works has been on strike now for two days.
About a fortnight ago the Schau Cotton Mills in the Vyborg Quarter went on
strike. The strike lasted about four days. The workers lost
it. The strike may break out anew any day. A fighting spirit prevails
everywhere, but it could hardly be said to be in favour of the Social-Democratic
line. Most of the workers stand for a purely economic struggle and against a
political one. However, we may expect and hope that this feeling will change and
the workers will realise that with out a political struggle they can achieve no
economic improvements. Today the Nevsky Shipyard (Semyannikov’s) went on
strike. The local branch of the Russian Factory Workers’ Assembly is trying to
lead the strike, but it will not succeed, of course. The Social-Democrats will
be the leaders, notwithstanding the fact that they are woefully weak here.


“Leaflets have been issued by the St. Petersburg

Commit tee: 

two addressed
to the Schau Cotton Mills and one to

    

the Putilov workers. A meeting of the Nevsky Shipyard workers was held today. It
      drew about 500 workers. Members of the local branch of the Assembly spoke
      for the first time. They avoided political demands and put forward chiefly
      economic demands. Shouts of disapproval were heard in the crowd. At this
      point Stroyev, of Russkaya Gazeta, who is greatly respected
    among the St. Petersburg workers, came forward and proposed a resolution,
    which, he said, had been drafted by him and representatives of
    Social-Democracy. The resolution, though emphasising the antagonism of class
    interests between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, did this
    inadequately. Social-Democratic workers spoke after Stroyev and supported
    the resolution in principle, although stressing its limited character and
    its inadequacy. This started a commotion; some of those present did not like
    the speeches of the Social-Democrats and tried to obstruct the meeting. The
    majority voted against the chairman, who was among the obstructionists, and
    elected a new chairman, a socialist. The members of the (Zubatov) ’society’,
    however, refused to keep silent and continued to make disturbances. Al
    though the overwhelming majority of the meeting (90 per cent) sided with the
    socialists, the meeting in the long run broke up without achieving anything
    and postponed its decision until the next day. One thing can be said at any
    rate—the Social-Democrats succeeded in turning the mood of the workers
    in their favour. Tomorrow there is to be a big meeting. There may be two or
    three thousand people there. An imposing demonstration is to be expected one
    of these days, something like the July demonstration in the South in
    1903. The Franco-Russian Society Works is on strike—about four to five
    thousand people. They say a strike has started at the Stieglitz Cotton
    Mills—about five thousand. A strike is expected at the Obukhov
    Works— five or six thousand.”


Comparing this information of a Social-Democrat, a local committee-man (who
could only know, of course, what was happening in a small area in
St. Petersburg), with the foreign press reports, especially the English, we are
led to the conclusion that the latter are distinguished by a high degree of
accuracy.

 

The strike spread from day to day with amazing speed. The workers held numerous
meetings and drew up a “charter” of their own—their economic
and political demands. Both these demands, despite the Zubatovist leadership,
coincided on the whole with the demands of the Social-Democratic Party
programme, including the slogan for the convocation of a Constituent Assembly on
the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot. The
spontaneous growth of this strike, unexampled in point of magnitude, was far,
far in advance of the planned participation in the movement on the part of the
organised Social-Democrats. But let them speak for

them selves.

7
The Eve of Bloody Sunday

In our account of the movement’s progress we stopped at the point at which, on
the initiative of Gapon, the procession of the working-class masses to the
Winter Palace to present a “petition” to the tsar for convening a
Constituent Assembly was set for Sunday, January 9. By Saturday, the 8th, the
strike in St. Petersburg had become a general strike. Even official reports
placed the number of strikers at 100-150 thousand. Russia had never yet
witnessed such a gigantic outbreak of the class struggle. The whole industrial,
business, and public life of the great centre with its population of one and a
half million was paralysed. The proletariat showed by deeds that modern
civilisation owes its existence to it and to it alone, that
its labour creates wealth and luxury and that upon it rests our whole
“culture”. The city found itself without newspapers, without
lighting, and without water. And the general strike bore a clearly defined
political character; it was a direct prelude to the revolutionary events.


An eyewitness thus describes the eve of the historic day in a letter addressed
to us:


“Beginning with January 7 the strike in St. Petersburg became a general
strike. Not only all the big factories and mills, but many workshops came to a
standstill. Today, January 8, not a single newspaper, except for
Praviteistvenny Vestnik[2]

 and Vedomosti S. Peterburgskovo

Gradonachalstva,[1]

 has appeared. The leadership of the movement

    

is still in the hands of the Zubatovists. We are witnessing an unprecedented
scene in St. Petersburg, and the suspense makes one’s heart contract with fear
as to whether the Social-Democratic organisation will be able to take the
movement into its own hands, at least after a while. The situation is extremely
grave. Throughout these past days mass meetings of workers are daily taking
place in all city districts at the headquarters of the ’Association of Russian
Workers’. The surrounding streets are filled with thousands of workers. From
time to time the Social-Democrats make speeches and distribute leaflets. They
are received on the whole sympathetically, although the Zubatovists
try to set up an opposition. When the autocracy is mentioned, the Zubatov people
shout: ’We don’t care about that, the autocracy doesn’t stand in our way!’ On
the other hand, the speeches which the Zubatovists make at the ’Association’
headquarters contain all the Social-Democratic demands, beginning with the
eight-hour day and ending with the convocation of a Constituent Assembly on the
basis of equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. Only the Zubatovists assert
that the granting of these demands implies, not the overthrow of the autocracy,
but the bringing of the people closer to the tsar and the elimination of the
bureaucracy, which stands between the tsar and the people.


“The Social-Democrats address meetings, too, in the headquarters of the
Association, and their speeches are listened to sympathetically; but the
initiative in practical proposals comes from the Zubatovists. Despite the
objections of the Social-Democrats, these proposals are adopted. They boil down
to the following: on Sunday, January 9, the workers are to go to the Winter
Palace and, through the priest Georgi Gapon, hand the tsar a petition listing
all the demands of the workers and ending with the words, ’Give us all this or
we must die’. Those who direct the meetings add: ’If the tsar refuses, then our
hands will be untied; for it means that he is our enemy, and then we will come
out against him and unfurl the red banner. If our blood is shed, it will be upon
his head.’ The petition is being adopted everywhere. The workers swear that they
will come out into the square on Sunday ’with their wives

    

and children’. Today the petition is going to be signed by districts, and at 2
      o’clock all are to assemble at the ’People’s House’ for the final meeting.


“All this is taking place with the full connivance of the police, who have
been everywhere withdrawn, although some buildings have mounted gendarmes hidden
in the yards.


“Today the streets are placarded with notices from the City Administrator
banning meetings and threatening the use of armed force. The workers tear them
off. Troops are being drawn up into the city from the environs. The tramway
employees (conductors and drivers) have been forced to go to work by Cossacks
with drawn sabres.”

The Number of Killed or Wounded

Reports as to the number of killed or wounded differ. Naturally, there can be no
question of an exact count, and a visual estimate is very difficult. The
government’s re port giving 96 killed and 330 wounded is obviously false, and no
one believes it. According to the latest press reports, journalists handed the
Minister of the Interior a list of 4,600 killed or wounded, as compiled
by reporters. Of course, even this figure cannot be complete, since it
would be impossible even in the day-time (let alone at night) to count all the
killed and wounded in the various clashes.


The victory of the autocracy over the unarmed people took a toll no smaller than
did the big battles in Manchuria. No wonder the St. Petersburg workers,
according to the reports of foreign correspondents, cried out to the officers
that they were more successful at fighting the Russian people than they were
the Japanese.

The Battles on the Barricades[1]

As we have seen, most of the correspondents’ reports refer to the barricades on
Vasilyevsky Island, and partly in Nevsky Prospekt. The official report published
on Monday, January 10 (23), reads: “The mob threw up barricades with
barbed wire entanglements and red flags on the Schlüsselburg Highway, then at
the Narvskaya Zastava, on the Troitsky Bridge, at the Alexandrovsky Gardens, and
at the public gardens in Nevsky Prospekt. Stones were thrown and shots fired at
the troops from the adjoining houses. The crowd disarmed the police. Schoff’s
armoury was looted. In the first and second areas of Vasilyevsky Island the
mob cut the telegraph-wires and knocked down the telegraph-poles. A police
station was smashed up.”


A French correspondent telegraphed at 2:50 p.m. on Sunday: “Shooting is
continuing. The troops, apparently, have lost their head completely. Crossing
the Neva, I saw several signal lights and heard volleys of rifle shots. On
Vasilyevsky Island the barricades are illumined with bonfires kindled by the
strikers. This was as far as I could get. A sinister bugle sound is the signal
to fire. A battalion of soldiers with bayonetted rifles atilt charged
a barricade made of piled up sleighs. A real massacre started. The
bodies of about a
hundred workers were strewn over the scene of battle. Some fifty wounded
prisoners were escorted past me. The officer threatened we with his pistol and
ordered me to be off.”


Correspondents give very few details of the barricade
fighting. This is understandable, because they tried to
keep more or less at a safe distance from the danger spots.

    

As for the participants in the barricade fighting, probably only very few
      survived. There is even a report that the barricades were subjected to
      artillery fire, but it does not seem to have been confirmed.

The foreign press reported that at recent conferences in Tsarskoye Selo (after
the victory of January 9), with or without the tsar attending, the question of
the desirability of peace with Japan was animatedly discussed. In principle,
all who surround the adored monarch stand for peace now. The number of state
dignitaries who ten days ago were emphatically for continuing the war has now
dwindled considerably, and many of them have now become convinced advocates of
peace.


We mention this for the information of the simple Social-Democrats of the
so-called Central Organ of our Party, who failed to understand that the phrases
about âpeace at any priceâ, while remaining empty phrases
(for no one asked the opinion of the Social-Democrats, and their opinion counted
for nought), actually, in the present situation, have merely played into the
hands of the frightened adherents of the autocracy. Our new-Iskrists missed the
change of mood on the part of the whole European bourgeoisie (which began with
sympathy towards Japan and has long since started to shift in favour of Russia
through fear of the revolution—cf. Frankfurter Zeitung and
others). Now they miss the fact that the empty, hackneyed phrases about peace at
any price are beginning to be utilised also by the
St. Petersburg Ugryum-Burcheyevs[1]

for their own purpose.

In his letter of February 1, 1905, to the editors of the newspaper
Vperyod (Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party), the well-known leader
of the Swiss Social-Democrats, Hermann Greulich, incidentally expressed his
regret at the new split in the ranks of the Russian Social-Democrats and
remarked: “Wer die grössere Schuld an dieser Zersplitterung trägt,
das werde ich nicht entscheiden und ich habe den internationalen Entscheid bei
der deutschen Parteileitung angeregt” (“I do not undertake to
decide who is more to blame for this split. I have proposed to the leadership
of the German Social-Democratic Party that this question be settled through
international channels”).


The editors of Vperyod, together with Comrade Stepanov, representative
abroad of the Russian Bureau of Committees of the Majority, answered Greulich in
the letter appended below.


Since Comrade Greulich intends to call for an international decision, we are
communicating to all friends of Vperyod in foreign countries the
contents of our letter to him and request them to translate it into
their respective languages, and to bring it to the notice of the greatest
possible number of foreign Social-Democrats.


It is also desirable to translate into foreign languages Lenin’s Statement
and Documents on the Break of the Central Institutions with the Party, as
well as: (1) the resolutions of the Northern Conference, (2) the resolutions of
the Caucasian Conference; and (3) the resolutions of the Southern Conference.


Please let us know whether this request will be carried out.

    

The Letter to Greulich
February 3, 1905
Dear Comrade,

In your letter you touch on the question of which group of our Party (the
R.S.D.L.P.) is to blame for the split. You say that you have asked for the
opinion of the German Social-Democrats and the International Bureau on this
point. In view of this, we feel bound to explain to you how the split
occurred. We shall confine ourselves to the presentation of definitely
proved facts and refrain, as far as possible, from an evaluation of the
facts.


Until the end of 1903, our Party was the aggregate of the disconnected local
Social-Democratic organisations called committees. The Central
Committee and the Central Organ elected at the Party’s First Congress (in the
spring of 1898) were non-existent. They had been suppressed by the police and
never been revived. Abroad, a split had occurred between the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats (publication—Rabocheye Dyelo; hence,
Rabocheye Dyelo-ists) and Plekhanov. Iskra, founded in 1900,
sided with the latter. In the space of three years, between 1900 and 1903,
Iskra gained overwhelming influence among the Russian
committees. Iskra upheld the principles of revolutionary
Social-Democracy against “Economism” (alias Rabocheye
Dyelo-ism=’Russian variety of opportunism).


The lack of unity in the Party was felt keenly by all.


Finally, in August 1903, it became possible, abroad, to assemble the Second
Party Congress, at which were represented all the Russian
committees, the Bund[4]

(independent organisation of the Jewish proletariat), and
both groups abroad—the Iskra group and the
Rabocheye Dyelo group.


All participants in the Congress recognised its validity. The struggle at the
Congress was between the Iskrists and the anti-Iskrists (the Rabocheye
Dyelo-ists and the Bund); in between was the so-called
“Marsh”. The Iskrists carried the day. They achieved the adoption of
the Party programme (Iskra’s draft). Iskra was recognised as
the Central Organ, and its line as the line of the Party. A number of
resolutions on tactics were Iskrist in spirit, and the accepted

    

 Rules on organisation (Lenin’s draft) were Iskrist. Only with respect to
certain details were the Rules marred by the anti-Iskrists with the aid of a
minority of the Iskrists. The voting at the Congress was as follows: of the
total 51 votes, 33 were Iskra (24 Iskrists of the present
Majority and 9 of the present Minority), 10 were
“Marsh”, and 8 were anti-Iskrists (3 Rabocheye Dyelo-ists
and 5 Bundists). Towards the end of the Congress, before the elections,
seven delegates (2 Rabocheye Dyelo-ists and the 5 Bundists)
walked out. (The Bund withdrew from the Party.)


The minority of the Iskrists, supported, because of their mistakes, by all the
anti-Iskrists and the “Marsh”, became the minority of the
Congress (24 against 9+10+1, or, 24 against 20). At the election of
the central bodies it was decided to choose three persons to the Editorial Board
of the Central Organ and three to the Central Committee. Out of the six members
who constituted the old Editorial Board of Iskra—Plekhanov, Axelrod,
Zasulich, Starover, Lenin, and Martov—there were elected Plekhanov,
Lenin, and Martov. The intention was that the Central Committee should consist
of two elected from the majority and one from the minority.


Martov refused to take his seat on the Editorial Board without the three
“excluded” (non-elected) comrades, and the entire minority refused
to participate in the election of a Central Committee. No one ever disputed or
disputes now the validity of the elections, but after the Congress the Minority
refused to work under the leadership of the centres elected by the Congress.


This boycott continued for three months, from the end of August to the end of
November 1903. I s k r a (six issues, Nos. 46-51) was edited by

Ple/ihanov 

and Lenin alone. The Minority formed a secret organisation within the Party
(a fact now corroborated in the press by the
Minority followers themselves and denied by no one at the
present time). The
overwhelming majority of the Russian committees (12 of the 14 that had managed
to go on record at the time) condemned this disruptive boycott.


But Plekhanov, following the turbulent congress of the League
Abroad[5]

(= the Party organisation abroad), which took place in the last days
of October 1903, decided

    

to give way to the Minority, declaring before the whole Party in the article
      “What Should Not Be Done” (Iskra, No. 52, November
    1903) that for the sake of avoiding a split one must at times make
    concessions even to those who lean in error towards revisionism and
    act as anarcho-individualists (the underlined expressions are
    employed by Plekhanov literally in his article “What Should Not Be
    Done”). Lenin withdrew from the Editorial Board, not wishing to go against
    the decisions of the Congress. Plekhanov then co-opted all the four former
    editors. The Russian committees declared that they would wait and see what
    line the new Iskra would take and whether the Mensheviks had
    really joined the Editorial Board with peaceful intentions.


Precisely what the Bolsheviks had predicted came to pass. The old-Iskra
line was not retained, nor was peace brought into the Party by the new,
Menshevik Editorial Board. The Iskra line veered so sharply towards the
old Rabocheye Dyelo-ism, which had been repudiated by the Second
Congress, that even Trotsky, a prominent member of the Minority, author
of the programmatic pamphlet Our Political Tasks,which appeared
under the

edit or ship 

 of the new “Iskra”, stated
literally: “There is a gull between the old ’Iskra’ and the new ’Iskra’.” We confine ourselves to this declaration, made by one of our
opponents, in order not to have to go into lengthy explanations concerning the
instability of Iskra on questions of principle.


On the other hand, “the secret organisation of the Minority” was
not disbanded, but continued its boycott of the Central Committee. This covert
split of the Party into an open and a secret organisation was an intolerable hindrance to the work. An overwhelming majority of the Russian committees that
took a position on the crisis emphatically condemned both the line of the new
Iskra and the disorganising behaviour of the Minority. A general
clamour was raised on all sides for the immediate summoning of a Third Congress,
to find some way out of the intolerable situation.


Under our Party Rules, a special congress may be called only on the demand of
organisations commanding in the aggregate

    

 at least one half of the total votes (regular congresses are called,
“as far as possible”, every two years). This half had been
mustered already. But here the C.C. played the Majority false by taking
advantage of the fact that several of its members belonging to the Majority had
been arrested. Under the pretext of “reconciliation”, the members of
the C.C. who had escaped arrest made a deal with the secret organisation of
the Minority and declared that the organisation had been dissolved; at the
same time, in spite of the written declarations of the C.C. and behind the back
of the Party, three Mensheviks were co-opted into the C.C. This
co-optation took place in November or December 1904. Thus, the Minority was
fighting from August 1903 to November 1904, tearing the Party asunder, for the
sake of co-opting three persons into the Central Organ and three into the C.C.


The spurious central institutions thus formed met the demand for another
congress with silence or abuse.


Then the patience of the Russian committees gave out. They began to call their
own private conferences. So far three such conferences have been held: (1) the
Conference of the four Caucasian committees; (2) the Conference of three
southern committees (Odessa, Nikolayev, and Ekaterinoslav); and (3) the
Conference of six northern committees (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, Riga,
“the North”—i.e., Yaroslavl, Kostroma, and Vladimir— and,
lastly, Nizhni Novgorod). All these conferences declared for the
“Majority”, decided to support the publicists’ group of the Majority
(the group consisting of Lenin, Ryadovoi, Orlovsky, Galyorka,[6]
Voinov,[7]

and others), and elected their own Bureau. This Bureau was
instructed by the third, viz., the Northern, conference to constitute itself as
an Organising Committee and to convene a congress of the Russian
committees, i.e., the Third Congress of the Party, without regard for the centres abroad that had split from the Party.


This is how things stood on January 1, 1905 (new style). The Bureau of Committees
of the Majority has begun its work (conditions in our police-ridden country are
such that the convening of the Congress will, of course, be delayed for a few
months; the Second Congress was announced in December 1902, but was not
convened until August 1903). The

    

publicists’ group of the Majority founded an organ of the Majority, the
    newspaper Vperyod, published as a weekly since January 4
    (N.S.), 1905. To date (February 3, 1905) four numbers have already
    appeared. The line of Vperyod is the line of the old
      “Iskra”. In the name of the old Iskra, Vperyod
    resolutely combats the new Iskra.


Hence, in actual fact, there are now two Russian Social-Democratic Labour
Parties. One has the organ Iskra, “officially” called the
Central Organ of the Party; it has the C.C., and four committees in Russia
out of twenty (the other committees in Russia, apart from the twenty
represented at the Second Congress, were organised later, and the validity of
their confirmation is still in dispute). The other party has the organ
Vperyod, the Bureau of Russian Committees of the Majority, fourteen
committees in Russia (the thirteen above-named committees and the
Voronezh Committee, and most likely also the committees of Saratov,
the Urals, Tula, and

       Siberia[1]

).



The new-Iskrists have on their side all the opponents of the old
Iskra, all the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, and a large part of the
intelligentsia on the fringe of the Party. The Vperyod-ists have on
their side all who followed the old Iskra from conviction and on
principle, as well as a large part of the class-conscious, advanced workers, and
of the practical Party functionaries in Russia. Plekhanov, who was a Bolshevik
at the Second Party Congress (August 1903) and at the Congress of the League
(October 1903), but who has been fighting the “Majority” furiously
since November 1903, declared publicly on September 2, 1904 (this
statement has appeared in print) that the forces on both sides were
approximately equal.


We Bolsheviks maintain that we have on our side the majority of real Party
workers active in Russia. We consider that the main cause of the split and the
chief obstacle to unity is the disruptive behaviour of the Minority, which
refused to bow to the decisions of the Second Congress and preferred to have a
split rather than call the Third Congress.


At the present time the Mensheviks are splitting the local

    

 organisations everywhere in Russia. In St. Petersburg, for instance, they
prevented the Committee from organising a demonstration on November 28 (see
Vperyod,

No. 1[2]

).

Now they have broken away in St. Petersburg as a
separate group known as the “Group Attached to the Central Committee” and work against the local committee of the Party. Recently they
organised in Odessa another such local (“Central Committee”) group for
fighting the Party Committee. The falsity of their position has made the
Menshevik central institutions disorganise the local work of the Party, since
these central bodies did not want to accept the decision of the Party committees
that had elected them.


The differences in principle between Vperyod and new Iskra are
essentially the same as those between the old Iskra and Rabocheye
Dyelo. We consider these differences important, but, given the opportunity
fully to defend our views, the views of the old Iskra, we would not
consider these differences of themselves to be a bar to working together in one
Party.

A Brief Outline of the Split in the R.S.D.L.P. was
printed in leaflet form by the Berne (Switzerland) R.S.D.L.P. promotion group on
February 2 (15), 1905, with the following introduction: “The Berne

   

promotion group of the R.S.D.L.P., Vperyod, publishes this letter
because it considers it very important, especially for the comrades in Russia,
to have a brief outline of the split. Will the comrades abroad please forward
the letter to Russia.”





[4]

The Bend (the General Jewish Workers’ Union of
Lithuania, Poland, and Russia). organised in 1897, was an association
mainly of Jewish artisans in the western regions of Russia. The Bund joined the
R.S.D.L.P. at the First Congress (March 1898).


At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the Bundists demanded that the Bund be
recognised as the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat. Upon the
rejection of this organisational nationalism by the Congress, the Bund left the
Party.


In 1906, after the Fourth (Unity) Congress, the Bund re-entered the
R.S.D.L.P. The Bundists persistently supported the Mensheviks and waged an
unremitting struggle against the Bolsheviks. Although formally belonging to the
R.S.D.L.P., the Bund was a bourgeois-nationalist type of organisation. It
countered the Bolsheviks’ programmatic demand for the right of nations to
self-determination by a demand for cultural-national autonomy. During the First
World War (1914-18) it adopted the position of the social-chauvinists. In 1917
it supported the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government and fought on the
side of the enemies of the October Socialist Revolution. During the Civil War
leading Bund members joined forces with the counter-revolution. At the same
time, a change was taking place among the rank and file of the Bund in favour
of collaboration with the Soviet power. When the victory of the dictatorship of
the proletariat over the internal counter revolution and the foreign
interventionists became clearly revealed, the Bund declared that it relinquished
its struggle against the Soviet power. In March 1921 the Bund decided to
dissolve itself, and part of its membership entered the Russian Communist Party
(Bolsheviks) on the basis of the rules of admission.





[5]

The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy
Abroad was founded in October 1901 on Lenin’s initiative. Members of the
League were the foreign section of the Iskra-Zarya organisation, and
the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation, which included the Emancipation of
Labour group. The aim of the League was to disseminate the ideas of
revolutionary Social-Democracy and help to build up a militant Social-Democratic
organisation. Actually the League was Iskra’s representative abroad. It
recruited Iskra adherents from among Russian Social-Democrats living
abroad, gave financial sup port to Iskra, organised delivery of the
paper to Russia, and published Marxist popular literature. It also brought out
several bulletins and pamphlets. The Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. endorsed the League as the only Party organisation abroad
with the status of a
committee and authorised it to work under the direction and control of the
Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.


Following the Second Congress, the Mensheviks entrenched themselves in the
League and launched a struggle against Lenin and the

   

Bolsheviks. At the League’s Second Congress, in October 1903, the
Mensheviks slandered the Bolsheviks, after which Lenin and his adherents
left the session. The Mensheviks adopted new Rules of the League, which
were directed against the Party Rules approved by the Second Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. After this the League, which existed until 1905, became a
stronghold of Menshevism.

Cruel reprisals against all the discontented have become the governmentâs slogan
since January 9. On Tuesday, Trepov, one of the most hated servitors of tsarism
in the whole of Russia, notorious in Moscow for his brutality, his coarseness,
and his participation in the Zubatovist attempts to demoralise the workers, was
appointed Governor-General of St. Petersburg with dictatorial powers.


Arrests came thick and fast as from a horn of plenty. The first to be arrested
were the members of the liberal delegation, which, late on Saturday evening,
had gone to Witte and Svyatopolk-Mirsky to request the government to receive the
workersâ petition and not to order the troops to fire on the peaceful
demonstration. It goes without saying that these requests proved of no
avail. Witte referred the delegation to Svyatopolk-Mirsky; the latter refused
to receive it. The Deputy-Minister of the Interior, Rydziewski, received the
delegation very coldly and declared that it was not the government that had to
be persuaded, but the workers, that the government was fully informed of
everything that was going on, and that it had already made decisions which no
requests could alter. It is interesting that at the meeting of the liberals
which appointed this delegation the suggestion had even been made to dissuade
the workers from marching to the Winter Palace, upon which a friend of Gaponâs
who was present at the meeting declared that this would be use less, since the
workersâ decision was irrevocable. (This in formation was reported by
Mr. Dillon, correspondent of the English Daily Telegraph, and
subsequently corroborated by other correspondents.)

 

The members of the delegation—Gessen, Arsenyev, Kareyev, Peshekhonov,
Myakotin, Semevsky, Kedrin, Shnitnikov, Ivanchin-Pisarev, and Gorky (who was
arrested in Riga and brought to St. Petersburg)—were held in custody on
the ridiculous charge that they intended to organise a âprovisional
government of Russiaâ on the day after the revolution. Such a charge, of
course, is bound to collapse of itself. A number of the arrested men (Arsenyev,
Kedrin, and Shnitnikov) have been released. A vigorous campaign in behalf of
Gorky has been started in educated bourgeois circles abroad, and a petition to
the tsar for his release was signed by many prominent German scientists and
writers. These have now been joined by scientists and men of letters in Austria,
France, and Italy.


On Friday evening, four members of the staff of the newspaper Nasha
Zhizn were arrested: Prokopovich and his wife, Khizhnyakov, and Yakovlev
(Bogucharsky). Of the staff of the newspaper Nashi Dni,[1]

Ganeiser was arrested on Saturday morning. The police are trying very bard
to intercept the funds sent from abroad for the strikers or for the widows and
orphans of those killed in the massacre. People are being arrested en
masse. The warrant for Bogucharskyâs arrest was numbered 53 and for
Khizhnyakov 109. On Saturday the offices of both mentioned papers were raided
and all manuscripts without exception were confiscated, including detailed
accounts of the events of the entire week, accounts written and signed by
reliable eyewitnesses who had noted down all they had seen for the edification
of future generations. None of this material will ever see the light of day
now.


On Wednesday the number of arrests was so considerable that the prisoners had to
be placed two and three in a cell. In the case of workers, the new dictator is
casting all ceremony aside. Since Thursday they have been rounded up in batches
and hustled back to their home towns and villages. There they will, of course,
spread the story of the events of January 9 and advocate struggle against the
autocracy.


Trepov is falling back on his old Moscow tactics of ensnaring the working-class
masses with economic sops.


Employers are conferring with the Minister of Finance to devise various
concessions to the workers; there is talk of

    

the nine-hour day. On Tuesday the Minister of Finance received a delegation of
      workers, promised economic reforms, and warned against political
      agitation.


The police are trying their hardest to sow distrust and enmity between the
general public and the workers. Wednesdayâs reports in foreign newspapers state
most definitely that the police are trying to terrorise the population of
St. Petersburg with lurid accounts of robberies and other atrocious deeds
alleged to have been committed by the strikers. Deputy-Minister of the Interior
Rydziewski himself assured a visitor on Tuesday that the strikers were out to
loot, burn, destroy, and kill. Wherever they have been able, the strikers—at least their class-conscious leaders—have branded this as
slander. The police themselves sent out agents-provocateurs and house
janitors to smash windows, burn news-stands, and loot shops, in order to
terrorise the population. The workers, in fact, behaved so peacefully that they
roused the wonder of the foreign press correspondents who had witnessed the
horrors of January 9.


The police agents are now busy with a new âworkersâ
organisationâ. They pick suitable elements from among the workers, supply
them with money, set them on students and writers, and praise âthe true
public-spirited policy of Our Father the Tsarâ. It is not difficult to
find among two or three hundred thousand uneducated workers, crushed in spirit
by starvation, a few thousand who will nibble at this bait. These will be
âorganisedâ, they will be made to curse âthe liberal
fraudsâ and to declare loudly that they were fooled last Sunday. Then this
scum of the working class will appoint a delegation which will âhumbly
beseech the tsar to allow them to fall at his feet and repent them of the crimes
they committed last Sundayâ. âAccording to my information,â
continues the correspondent, âthis is precisely what the police are now
engaged in arranging. After they have put the finishing touches to this
organisation, His Majesty will most graciously deign to receive the delegation
in the Manage, which will be specially prepared for this occasion. He will make
a moving speech professing His fatherly concern for the workers and His anxiety
that measures be taken to improve their condition.â

 

P.S. These lines were already set up in type when telegrams arrived confirming
the predictions of the English correspondent. At his residence in

Tsarskoye Selo

the tsar received a delegation of thirty-four workers hand-picked by the police,
and he delivered a speech reeking with official hypocrisy about the governmentâs
paternal solicitude and about the forgiveness it held out to the offending
workers. Of course, this ghastly farce will not deceive the Russian
proletariat. The proletariat will never forget Bloody Sunday. It will yet speak
to the tsar in a different strain.

On Monday, January 10, St. Petersburg looked like a city just conquered
by an enemy. Cossack patrols kept riding through the streets. Here and there
stood excited groups of workers. In the evening many of the streets were plunged
in darkness. There was no electricity or gas. The aristocratic houses were
guarded by groups of janitors. Blazing news stands threw a lurid light on knots
of people.


In Nevsky Prospekt there were clashes between the people and the
military. Shots were again fired at the crowd. Three volleys were fired outside
the Anichkov Palace. The police shut the fire-arms shops and removed all weapons
to the cellars, taking apparently all possible measures to prevent the workers
from arming. The officials in the government offices were particularly alarmed;
they feared fires and explosions and fled from St. Petersburg in a panic.


The barricades which the troops had captured on Sunday on Vasilyevsky Island
were thrown up again on Monday and were recaptured by the soldiers.


There were no newspapers. The schools were closed. At numerous private meetings
the workers discussed the events and measures of resistance. Crowds of
sympathisers, especially students, besieged the hospitals.


The workers of Kolpino, twenty to thirty thousand strong, were said to have
marched out to Tsarskoye. Selo on Tuesday morning with a petition. The garrison
of Tsarskoye Selo sent out a regiment of infantry and a field battery to
intercept them. A clash occurred within five versts of Kolpino; the troops fired
and finally repulsed and scattered the workers at 4 p. m. There were many killed
and wounded. The workers twice attacked the Tsarskoye Selo railway,

    

but were repulsed. The rails were pulled up for a distance of seven versts and
no trains ran in the morning.


The government buried the victims of Bloody Vladimir Sunday at night, in
secret. The relatives and friends of the slain were deliberately misled, so that
no demonstrations would be held at the burials. Corpses were taken to
the Preobrazhensky Cemetery by the car-load. In some places the crowd
nevertheless
attempted, despite all police precautions, to hold demonstrations in honour of
the fallen fighters for liberty.


Feeling against the army among the population ran high. The foreign newspapers,
on the basis of accounts by eyewitnesses, report that on Tuesday, January
11, the Cossacks stopped a horse tram full of workers in Bolshoi Prospekt. One
of the workers had shouted at the Cossacks, âButchers!â The Cossacks
stopped the tram, made all the passengers get out and beat them with the flats
of their swords. One of the men was wounded. The tenants of nearby houses opened
their windows and shouted at the Cossacks, âMurderers! Bandits!â
Thursdayâs telegrams reported that during this incident a woman passenger was
also driven out of the tram by the Cossacks. In her fright she dropped her
child, which was trampled to death by the Cossacksâ horses (The Times).
Such victories of our troops over the workers are truly Pyrrhic Victories.

The first wave of the revolutionary storm is receding. We are on the eve of an
inescapable, inevitable second wave. The proletarian movement is spreading wider
and has now reached the remotest outlying regions of the country. Unrest and
discontent have seized the most diverse sections of society, even the most
backward. Commerce and industry are paralysed, schools are closed, and the
Zemstvo employees, following the example of the workers, have gone on
strike. In the lulls between the mass actions, individual terrorist acts are, as
usual, becoming more frequent: the attempt on the life of the Odessa Chief of
Police, the assassination in the Caucasus, the assassination of the Senate
Procurator in Helsingfors. The government is veering from the policy of the
bloody knout to a policy of promises. It tries to fool at least part of the
workers with the tsarâs farcical reception of a

     delegation.[1]

It tries to divert
public attention with war news, and it orders Kuropatkin to start an offensive
on the Hunho. On January 9 the massacre in St. Petersburg took place; the 12th
saw the launching of the offensive, from the military point of view absolutely
senseless, which ended in another serious defeat of the tsarâs generals. The
Russians were repulsed with casualties, which even according to the Novoye
Vremya correspondent amounted to 13,000 men, or about twice as many as the
Japanese. There is the same corruption and demoralisation in the handling of
military affairs in Manchuria that there is in St. Petersburg. In the foreign
press, dispatches confirming and denying Kuropatkinâs quarrel with Grippenberg
alternate

    

with dispatches confirming and denying the news that the Grand Ducal party is
alive to the danger which the war is creating for the autocracy and wants peace
as quickly as possible.


Small wonder that under such circumstances even the most sober bourgeois papers
of Europe never stop talking of a revolution in Russia. The revolution is
growing and maturing with a rapidity unknown, before January 9. Whether the next
wave will surge up tomorrow, the day after, or months hence, depends on quite a
number of unpredictable circumstances. All the more urgent, therefore, is the
task of summing up the revolutionary events and drawing from them the lessons
that may stand us in good stead much sooner than some are inclined to expect.


To evaluate correctly the revolutionary events we should have to make a general
survey of the most recent history of our working-class movement. Nearly twenty
years ago, in 1885, the first big workersâ strikes took place in the central
manufacturing district, at the Morozov Mills and else where. At that time Katkov
wrote that the labour question had emerged in Russia. With what astonishing
speed the proletariat has developed, passing from economic struggles to
political demonstrations, from demonstrations to the revolutionary onset! Let us
recall the chief

mile stones 

along the road traversed. 1885—widespread
strikes, in which an insignificant number of socialists participated, acting
entirely individually, not united in any organisations. Public sentiment over
the strikes compelled Katkov, that faithful watchdog of the autocracy, to speak,
in reference to the trial, about a âone-hundred-and-one gun salute in
honour of the labour question which has emerged in Russiaâ. The government
made economic concessions. 1891—participation of the St. Petersburg
workers in the demonstration, at Shelgunovâs funeral[6];

political speeches at the St. Petersburg May Day rally. We had here a
Social-Democratic demonstration of the advanced workers in the absence of a
mass movement. 1896—the St. Petersburg strike involving
scores of thousands of workers. A mass movement and the beginnings of street
agitation, this time with the participation of an en tire Social-Democratic
organisation. Small as this almost exclusively student organisation may have
been in comparison

    

 with our present-day party, its class-conscious, systematic,
      Social-Democratic intervention and leadership gave this movement
      tremendous scope and significance, as compared with the Morozov
      strike. Again the government made economic concessions. A firm basis was
      achieved for a strike movement throughout Russia. The revolutionary
      intelligentsia turned Social-Democrat en masse. The Social-Democratic Party was founded. 1901—the workers came to the aid of the
    students. A demonstration movement set in. The proletariat carried its
    rallying call, âDown with the Autocracy!â, into the streets. The
    radical intelligentsia definitely broke up into three parts—liberal,
    revolutionary-bourgeois, and Social-Democratic. The participation of revolutionary Social-Democratic organisations in the demonstrations became
    more and more widespread, active, and direct. 1902—the huge Rostov
    strike developed into an impressive demonstration. The political movement
    of the proletariat was no longer an adjunct of the movement of
      the intellectuals, of the students, but grew directly out of the
      strike. The
    participation of organised revolutionary Social-Democrats became still more
    active. The proletariat won for it self and for the revolutionary
    Social-Democrats of its committee the right to hold mass meetings
    in the streets. For the first time the proletariat stood as a class against
    all other classes and against the tsarist government. 1903—again
    strikes merged with political demonstrations, but now on a still broader
    basis. The strikes involved an entire district and more than a hundred
    thousand workers; in a number of cities political mass meetings were
    repeatedly held in the course of the strikes. There was a feeling of being
    on the eve of barricades (the opinion which the local Social-Democrats
    expressed on the movement in Kiev in 1903[7]).

But the eve
    proved rather protracted, teaching us, as it were, that it takes powerful
    classes sometimes months and years to gather strength; putting, as it were,
    the sceptical intellectual adherents of Social-Democracy to the test. And
    sure enough, the intellectualist wing of our Party, the new-Iskrists or,
    what amounts to the same thing, the new-Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, have
    already begun to seek âhigher typesâ of demonstrations, in the
    form of agreements between the workers and the Zemstvo people not to create
    panic fear.

    

With the lack of principle characteristic of all opportunists, the new-Iskrists
have now talked themselves into the preposterous, incredibly preposterous,
thesis that in the political arena there are two (!) forces: the bureaucracy
and the bourgeoisie (see the Iskra editorsâ second letter in
connection with the Zemstvo campaign). The opportunists of the new
Iskra, these believers in carpe diem, have forgotten
that the
proletariat constitutes an independent force! Came the year 1905, and January 9
once again showed up all such backsliding types of the intelligentsia brood. The
proletarian movement at once rose to a higher plane. The general strike rallied
at least a million workers all over Russia. The political demands of the
Social-Democrats found their way even to the sections of the working class that
still believed in the tsar. The proletariat broke down the framework of the
police-sponsored Zubatov movement, and virtually the entire membership of the
legal workersâ society founded for the purpose of combating the revolution took
the path of revolution together with Gapon. Strikes and demonstrations began to
develop into an uprising before our very eyes. The participation of
organised revolutionary Social-Democracy was incomparably more in evidence than
in the previous stages of the movement; yet it was still weak, weak in
comparison with the overwhelming demand of the active proletarian masses for
Social-Democratic leadership.


Altogether, the two movements, strikes and demonstrations, combining in various
forms and on various occasions, grew in breadth and in depth, became more and
more revolutionary, came ever more closer in practice to the general armed
uprising of the people, of which revolutionary Social-Democracy had long
spoken. We drew this conclusion from the events of January 9 in

Nos. 4[2]

and 5 of Vperyod. The St. Petersburg workers drew this conclusion
for themselves, forthwith and directly. On January 10 they forced their way
into a legal printing office, set up the following leaflet sent to us by
the St. Petersburg comrades, printed it in over 10,000 copies, and
distributed it throughout St. Petersburg. The text of this remarkable
leaflet

      follows.[3]

 

This appeal needs no comment. The initiative of the revolutionary proletariat
      found full expression here. The call of the St. Petersburg workers was not
      answered as quickly as they wished; it will have to be repeated time and
      again; the attempts to carry it out will more than once result in
      failure. But the tremendous significance of the fact that the task has
      been set by the workers themselves is in disputable. The gain made by the
      revolutionary movement, which has brought about a realisation of the
      practical urgency of this task and made it an essential issue of every
      popular movement, is a gain that nothing can now take away from the
      proletariat.


It is worth dwelling on the history of the idea of insurrection. The new
Iskra has given us so many nebulous platitudes on this question,
beginning with the famous leader in issue No. 62, it has presented us with so
many muddled opportunist ideas, entirely worthy of our old acquaintance
Martynov, that the precise reproduction of the old formulation of the question
is of particular importance. In any case,it is impossible to keep track of all
the platitudes and muddled ideas of the new Iskra. It is much wiser to
have the old Iskra more often in mind and enlarge more concretely upon
its old constructive slogans.


At the end of Leninâs pamphlet What Is To Be Done?, on

       p. 136,[4]

the
slogan of a general armed uprising of the people was advanced. The
following was said on this subject at the very beginning of 1902, that is, three
years ago: âPicture to yourselves a popular uprising. Probably everyone
will now agree that we must think of this uprising and prepare for

       it....â[5]

February 11, 1905


I wired my consent to your changes yesterday, although I emphatically do not
agree with what I could gather from your letter. But I am so sick of this
procrastination, and your questions seemed such a mockery, that I just gave it
up, thinking, If only they did something! If only they gave notice of the
Congress, any kind of notice, so long as they gave it, instead
of just talking about it. You will be surprised at my use of the word
mockery. But just stop and think: two months ago I sent my draft to all
members of the

       Bureau.[1]

Not one of them is interested in it or finds it necessary to discuss
it. And now—by wire.... A nice business:
we talk of organisation, of centralism, while actually there is such disunity,
such amateurism among even the closest comrades in the centre, that one feels
like chucking it all in disgust. Just look at the Bundists: they do not prate
about centralism, but every one of them writes to the centre weekly and
contact is thus actually maintained. You only have to pick up their

    Posledniye Izvestia[2]

to see this contact. We, however, here are
issuing the sixth number of yet one of our editors (Rakhmetov) has not written a
single line, either about or for Vperyod. Our people
âtalkâ of extensive literary connections in St. Petersburg and in Moscow,
and of the Majorityâs young forces, while we here, two months after
the issuance of the call for collaboration (the announcement of
Vperyod and a letter in connection with it), have seen or heard nothing
from them. The Russian committees

    

(Caucasus, Nizhni-Novgorod, not to speak of the Volga region or the South)
      consider the Bureau a âmythâ, and with perfect
      justification. We did âhearâ from strangers about some sort of
      alliance between the St. Petersburg Committee of the Majority and a group
      of Mensheviks, but from our own people not a word. We refuse to believe
      that Bolsheviks could have taken such an imbecilic, suicidal step. We did
      âhearâ from strangers about a conference of Social-Democrats
      and the formation of a âblocâ, but from our own people not
      a word, although there are rumours that this is a fait
      accompi. Evidently, the members of the Majority are anxious
      to be imposed
    upon again.


Our only strength lies in utter frankness, in solidarity, and indetermined
assault. But people, it seems, have gone soft now that we have a
ârevolutionâ! At a time when organisation is needed a hundred times more
than ever before they sell out to the disrupters. It is evident from the proposed changes in the draft of the declaration and Congress call (set forth in
the letter so vaguely as to be almost unintelligible) that âloyaltyâ
has been put on a pedestal.

       Papasba[3]

actually uses that word, adding that if the
centres are not mentioned, no one will come to the Congress! Well, gentlemen, I
can wager that if

  t h i s

is the way you are going to act, you will
never have a congress and never escape from under the thumb of the Bonapartists
of the Central Organ and the Central Committee. To call a congress
against the central bodies, in which lack of confidence has been
expressed, to call this Congress in the name of a revolutionary bureau
(which, if we are to pay slavish obeisance to the loyal Party Rules, is
non-existent and fictitious), and to recognise the unqualified right of
the nine Bonapartists, the League (ha! ha!), and the Bonapartist creatures (the
freshly hatched committees) to attend that Congress, means to make our selves
ridiculous and to lose all right to respect. The centres may and should be
invited, but to accord them voting status is, I repeat, madness. The centres, of
course, will not come to our Congress anyway; but why give them another
chance to spit in our faces? Why this hypocrisy, this game of hide-and-seek? It
is a positive shame! We bring the split into the open,

    

we call the Vperyod-ists to a congress, we want to organise a
Vperyod-ist party, and we break immediately any and all
connections with the disorganisers—and yet we are having loyalty dinned
into our ears, we are asked to act as though a joint congress of Iskra
and Vperyod were possible. What a farce! The very first day, the very
first hour of the Congress (if it does take place) will beyond doubt ring down
the curtain on this farce; but until the Congress meets such deceit can do us
untold harm.


Really, I sometimes think that nine-tenths of the Bolsheviks are actually
formalists. Either we shall rally all who are out to fight into a really
iron-strong organisation and with this small but strong party quash that
sprawling monster, the new-Iskra motley elements, or we shall prove
by our conduct that we deserve to go under for being contemptible
formalists. How is it that people do not understand that prior to the
Bureau and prior to âVperyodâ we did all we could to save
loyalty, to save unity, to save the formal, i.e., higher methods of settling the
conflict?! But now, after the Bureau, after
âVperyodâ, the split is a fact. And when the split had become a
fact it became evident that materially we were very much weaker. We
have yet to convert our moral strength into material strength. The Mensheviks
have more money, more literature, more transportation facilities, more agents,
more ânamesâ, and a larger staff of contributors. It would be
unpardonable childishness not to see that. And if we do not wish to present to
the world the repulsive spectacle of a dried-up and anaemic old maid, proud of
her barren moral purity, then we must understand that we need war and a battle
organisation. Only after a long battle, and only with the aid of an excellent
organisation can we turn our moral strength into material strength.


We need funds. The plan to hold the Congress

  i n   L o n d o n

is sublimely ridiculous, for it would cost twice as much. We cannot
suspend publication of Vperyod, which is what a long absence
would mean. The Congress must be a simple affair, brief, and small in
attendance. This is a congress for the organisation of the
battle. Clearly, you are cherishing illusions in this respect.  

We need people to work on Vperyod. There are not enough of us. If we do
not get two or three extra people from Russia

    

as permanent contributors, there is no sense in continuing to prate about a
      struggle against Iskra. Pamphlets and leaflets are needed, and
    needed desperately.


We need young forces. I am for shooting on the spot any one who presumes to say
that there are no people to be had. The people in Russia are legion; all we have
to do is to recruit young people more widely and boldly, more boldly and
widely, and again more widely and again more boldly, without fearing
them. This is a time of war. The youth—the students, and still more
so the young workers—will decide the issue of the whole struggle. Get rid
of all the old habits of immobility, of respect for rank, and so
on. Form hundreds of circles of Vperyod-ists from among the
youth and encourage them to work at full blast. Enlarge the Committee
threefold by accepting young people into it, set up half a dozen or a
dozen subcommittees, âco-optâ any and every honest and energetic
person. Allow every subcommittee to write and publish leaflets without any red
tape (there is no harm if they do make a mistake; we on Vperyod will
âgentlyâ correct them). We must, with desperate speed, unite all
people with revolutionary initiative and set them to work. Do not fear their
lack of training, do not tremble at their inexperience and lack of
development. In the first place, if you fail to organise them and spur them on
to action, they will follow the Mensheviks and the Gapons, and this very
inexperience of theirs will cause five times more harm. In the second place,
events themselves will teach them in our spirit. Events are already
teaching everyone precisely in the Vperyod spirit.


Only you must be sure to organise, organise, and organise hundreds of
circles, completely pushing into the back ground the customary, well-meant
committee (hierarchic) stupidities. This is a time of war. Either you create
new, young, fresh, energetic battle organisations everywhere for
revolutionary Social-Democratic work of all varieties among all strata, or you
will go under, wearing the aureole of âcommitteeâ bureaucrats.


I shall write of this in

   Vperyod[4]

and speak of it at the Congress. I am
writing to you in one more endeavour to evoke

    

an exchange of ideas, to call upon you to bring a dozen

y o u n g,  
f r e s h

 workersâ (and other) circles into direct contact with
the Editorial Board, although ... although between ourselves be it said, I do
not cherish the slightest hope that these daring ideas will be fulfilled,
unless, perhaps, two months from now you will ask me to wire whether I agree to
such-and-such changes in the âplanâ.... I reply in advance that I
agree to everything. Good-bye until the Congress.


Lenin


P.S. You must make it your aim to revolutionise the delivery of
Vperyod into Russia. Carry on widespread propaganda for subscriptions
from St. Petersburg. Let students and especially workers subscribe for
scores and hundreds of copies to be sent to their own addresses. It is absurd to
have fears on this score in times like these. The police can never intercept
all the copies. Half the number or a third will arrive, and that amounts to very
much. Suggest this idea to any youth circle, and it will find hundreds
of ways of its own to make connections abroad. Distribute addresses more widely,
as widely as possible, for the transmission of letters to Vperyod.

From the very beginning of the mass working-class movement in Russia, i.e.,
approximately for the past ten years, profound differences have existed among
Social-Democrats on questions of tactics. As we know, it was differences of this
kind that gave rise, in the late nineties, to the trend of Economism, which led
to the split into an opportunist (Rabocheye Dyelo) wing and into a
revolutionary (old-Iskra) wing of the Party. Russian Social-Democratic
opportunism, however, differed from that of Western Europe in certain peculiar
features. It strikingly reflected the point of view, or rather the absence of
any independent point of view, of the intellectualist wing of the Party, which
was carried away both by the current catchwords of Bernsteinism and by the forms
and immediate results of the pure-and-simple labour movement. This infatuation
led to wholesale treachery on the part of the legal Marxists, who went over to
liberalism, and to the creation by Social-Democrats of the famous
âtactics-as-processâ theory, which firmly attached to our
opportunists the
label of âtail-endersâ. They trailed helplessly behind events,
plunged from one extreme to another, and in all cases reduced the scope of
activity of the revolutionary proletariat and its faith in its own strength,
all of which was usually done on the pretext of raising the
independent activity of the proletariat. Strange, but true. No one
talked so much about the
independent activity of the workers, and no one did so much by his propaganda to
narrow, curtail, and diminish that activity as did the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists.


âTalk less about âraising the activity of the working massesâ," the
class-conscious, advanced workers said to their zealous but misguided
advisers. âWe are far more active than

    

you think, and we are quite able to support, by open street fighting, even
demands that do not promise any âtangible resultsâ whatever. It is not for you
to âraiseâ our activity, because activity is precisely the thing you yourselves
lack. Bow less in subservience to spontaneity, and think more about raising your
own activity, gentlemen!â This is how the attitude of the revolutionary workers
towards the opportunist intellectuals had to be characterised. (What Is To
Be Done?,

p. 55.[1]

)



The two steps back which the new Iskra took towards Rabocheye
Dyelo revived this attitude. Once again the columns of Iskra pour
forth the preachings of tail-ism under cover of the same nauseating vows:
Verily, 0 Lord, I do profess and believe in the independent activity of the proletariat. It was in the name of the independent activity of the proletariat that
Axelrod, Martynov, Martov, and Lieber (the Bundist) defended at the Congress the
right of professors and students to become members of the Party without joining
any Party organisation. It was in the name of the in dependent activity of the
proletariat that the âorganisation as-processâ theory was invented,
a theory that justified disorganisation and glorified the anarchism of the
intellectuals. It was in the name of the independent activity of the
proletariat that the no less famous âhigher-type-of-demonstrationâ
theory was invented, in the form of an agreement between a workersâ
delegation, which had been passed through the sieve of a three-stage system of
elections, and the Zemstvo men for a peaceful demonstration that was
to create no panic fear. It was in the name of the independent activity of the
proletariat that the idea of the armed uprising was perverted and vulgarised,
debased and confused.


In view of its vast practical importance, we should like to draw the readerâs
attention to this question. The development of the working-class movement
played a cruel joke on the wise men of the new Iskra. They circulated a
letter in Russia, which, in the name of âthe process of the systematic
development of the class-consciousness and independent activity of the
proletariatâ, recommended, as a higher type of demonstration, âthat
the workersâ petitions be posted to

    

the homes of the municipal councillors and a considerable number of copies
      scattered in the Zemstvo Assembly Hallâ; they sent a second letter
      to Russia, conveying the most sensational discovery that at the present
      âhistorical moment the political stage is fully occupied [!] by the
      conflict between the organised bourgeoisie and the bureaucracyâ and
      that âevery [mark well!] revolutionary movement of the lower strata
      has only one [!] objective meaning, to support the slogans of that one of
      the two [!!] forces which is interested in breaking down the present
      regimeâ (the democratic intelligentsia was declared to be âa
      forceâ); hardly had the first letter been circulated and the second letter
      reached Russia, hardly had the class-conscious workers had time to read
      these marvellous missives and to have a good laugh at them, when the
      events of the real struggle of the proletariat promptly swept all this
      political rubbish of the new-Iskra publicists on to the waste
    heap. The proletariat showed that there is a third force (actually,
    of course, not third, but, in sequence, second and in fighting ability
    first), which is not merely interested in breaking down the autocratic
    regime, but is ready to start on the actual job of breaking it
      down. Since the Ninth of January, the working-class movement has
      been developing before our very eyes into the popular uprising.


Let us see how this transition to the uprising was evaluated by the
Social-Democrats, who had discussed it in advance as a question of tactics, and
how the workers themselves began to settle this question in practice.


Three years ago the following was said on insurrection as a slogan that defines
our immediate, practical tasks:
âPicture to yourselves a popular uprising. Probably every one will now
agree that we must think of this uprising and prepare for it. But how? Surely
the Central Committee can not appoint agents to all localities for the purpose
of preparing the uprising! Even if we had a Central Committee, it could achieve
absolutely nothing by such appointments under present-day Russian
conditions. But a network of agents that would form in the course of
establishing and distributing the common newspaper would not have to âsit about
and waitâ for the call to insurrection, but could carry on such regular activity
as would guarantee the highest probability of success in the event of an
insurrection. Such activity

    

would strengthen our connections with the broadest masses of the workers
and with all strata that are discontented with the autocracy, which is of such
importance for an uprising. Precisely such activity would serve to cultivate the
ability to estimate correctly the general political situation and,
consequently, the ability to select the proper moment for the
uprising. Precisely such activity would train all local organisations
to respond simultaneously to the same political questions, incidents, and events
that agitate the whole of Russia and to react to these âincidentsâ in the most
vigorous, uniform, and expedient manner possible; for the up rising is in
essence the most vigorous, most uniform, and most expedient âanswerâ of the
entire people to the government. And lastly, it is precisely such activity that
would train all revolutionary organisations throughout Russia to maintain the
most continuous, and at the same time the most secret, contacts with one
another, thus creating real Party unity; for without such contacts it
will be impossible collectively to discuss the plan for the uprising and to take
the necessary preparatory measures on the eve, measures that must be kept in the
strictest secrecy.


âIn a word, the âplan for an all-Russian

political news paperâ, 

far from
representing the fruits of the labour of arm chair workers, infected with
dogmatism and bookishness (as it seemed to those who gave but little thought to
it), is the most practical plan for immediate and all-round preparation of
the uprising, with, at the same time, no loss of sight for a moment of
the pressing day-to-day work.â (What Is To Be

      Done?[2]

)



The concluding words, which we have underlined, give a clear answer to the
question how the revolutionary Social-Democrats envisaged the work of preparing
the uprising. But clear as this answer is, the old tail-ist tactics could not
fail to assert themselves on this point also. Quite recently Martynov published
a pamphlet entitled Two Dictatorships, which has been strongly
recommended by the new Iskra (No. 84). The author is stirred to the
depths of his Rabocheye Dyelo soul with indignation at the fact that
Lenin could bring himself to speak of âpreparing, timing, and

    

carrying out the general armed uprising of the peopleâ. The stern Martynov
      smites the enemy with the statement:
âOn the basis of historical experience and a scientific analysis of the
dynamics of social forces, international Social Democracy has always recognised
that only palace revolutions and pronunciamentos can be timed in
advance and carried out successfully according to a previously prepared plan,
for the very reason that they are not popular revolutions, i.e., revolutions in
social relations, but only reshufflings among the ruling
cliques. Social-Democracy has always and everywhere recognised that a peopleâs
revolution cannot be timed in advance, that it is riot prepared
artificially, but that it comes about of itself.â


Perhaps, having read this tirade, the reader will say that obviously Martynov is
âanything butâ a serious opponent and that it would be absurd to
take him seriously. We would quite agree with the reader. We would even say to
such a reader that no greater evil on earth could befall us than to have to
take all the theories and all the arguments of our new Iskra people
seriously. The only trouble is that this nonsense appears also in the editorials
of Iskra (No. 62). Worse still, there are people in the Party, by no
means few, who stuff their heads with this nonsense. And so we have to discuss
non-serious matters, just as we have to discuss the âtheoryâ of Rosa
Luxemburg, who discovered the âorganisation-as processâ. We are
obliged to explain to Martynov that up rising must not be confused with peopleâs
revolution. We have to keep explaining that profound allusions to a revolution
in social relations when what is at issue is the practical question of the ways
of overthrowing Russian autocracy are worthy only of a Kifa
Mokiyevich.[6]

This revolution began in Russia with the abolition of serfdom, and it is the
backwardness of our political superstructure as compared with the accomplished
revolution in social relations that makes the collapse of the superstructure
inevitable; an immediate collapse as the result of a single blow is
quite possible, since âthe peopleâs revolutionâ in Russia has
already dealt tsarism a hundred blows, and whether the hundred and first or the
hundred and tenth will finish it off is really a matter of conjecture. Only
opportunist intellectuals, who try to impute their own philistine ways to the
proletarians, can

    

flaunt their high school knowledge of a ârevolution in social
relationsâ at a time when practical ways are being discussed for
delivering one of the blows in the second hundred. Only the opportunists of the
new Iskra can raise hysterical clamours about a sinister
âJacobinâ plan, the keynote of which, as we have seen, is all-round
mass agitation by means of a political newspaper.


A peopleâs revolution, true, cannot be timed. We cannot but praise Martynov and
the writer of the leader in Iskra, No. 62, for knowing this truth
(âwhat thought of preparing the uprising can there possibly be in our
Party?â asked Martynovâs loyal associate, or disciple, in that article, warring
on the âutopiansâ). But if we have really prepared an uprising, and if a
popular uprising is realisable by virtue of the revolutions in social relations
that have already taken place, then it is quite possible to time the
uprising. We shall attempt to clarify the point for the new-Iskra
followers by a simple example. Can the working-class movement be timed? No, it
cannot; for that movement is made
 up of thousands of separate acts arising from a revolution in social
relations. Can a strike be timed? It can, despite the fact—just imagine,
Comrade Martynov—despite the fact that every strike is the result of a
revolution in social relations. When can a strike be timed? When the organisation or group calling it has influence among the masses of the workers
involved and is able correctly to gauge the moment when discontent and
resentment among them are mounting. Do you see the point now, Comrade Martynov
and Comrade âleader-istâ of Iskra, No. 62? If you do, then
please take the trouble to compare an uprising with a peopleâs
revolution. âA peopleâs revolution cannot be timed in advance.â An
uprising can be, if those preparing it have influence among the masses and can
correctly estimate the situation.


Fortunately, the initiative of the advanced workers happens to be far ahead of
the tail-ist philosophy of the new Iskra. While the latter is squeezing
itself dry for theories to prove that an uprising cannot be timed by those who
have prepared for it and have organised the vanguard of the revolutionary
class, events show that those who have not prepared may time, indeed, are
sometimes compelled to timer an uprising.

 

Here is a leaflet sent to us by a St. Petersburg comrade.
It was set up, printed, and distributed in more than 10,000
copies by the workers themselves, who had seized a legal
printing-press in St. Petersburg on January 10.


âWorkers of All Countries, Unite!


âCitizens! Yesterday you witnessed the brutality of the
autocratic government. You saw blood flowing in the streets. You saw hundreds of
fighters for the working-class cause lying dead; you saw death, you heard the
groans of wounded women and defenceless children. The blood and brains of
workers bespattered the roadways that workersâ hands had laid. Who directed the
troops, the rifles, and the bullets against the workersâ breasts?


âThe tsar, the grand dukes, the Ministers, the generals, and the scoundrels
at Court.


âThey are the murderers! Death to them! To arms, comrades, seize
the arsenals, the munitions depots, and armourersâ shops. Break down the prison
walls, comrades, and release the fighters for freedom. Smash up the gendarme and
police stations and all government institutions. Let us overthrow the tsarist
government and establish our own. Long live the revolution! Long live
the Constituent Assembly of Peopleâs Representatives!


âRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party.â


The call to insurrection issued by this handful of advanced enterprising
workers did not meet with success. Several unsuccessful calls to insurrection,
or several unsuccessful âtimingsâ of insurrection would not
surprise or discourage us. We leave it to the new Iskra to hold forth
in this connection on the necessity of a ârevolution in social
relationsâ and grandiloquently to condemn the âutopianismâ of
the workers who exclaimed, âLet us establish our own government!â Only
hopeless pedants or muddle-heads would regard this watchword as the central
point of such an appeal. What is important for us to note and emphasise is the
remark ably bold and practical manner in which the problem now squarely
confronting us was posed.


The call of the St. Petersburg workers was not answered and could not have been
answeredâ as quickly as they wished. This call will be repeated time and again,
and the attempts at an uprising may result in more failures. But the very fact

    

that the workers themselves have raised this issue is of tremendous
significance. The gain which the working-class movement has made in bringing
home the practical urgency of this problem and in moving it closer to the
forefront of any popular unrest is a gain that nothing can take away from the
proletariat.


As much as three years ago the Social-Democrats had on general grounds advanced
the slogan of preparing the uprising. The independent activity of the
proletariat arrived at the same slogan as a result of the direct lessons taught
by the civil war. There are two kinds of independent activity. There is the
independent activity of a proletariat possessed of revolutionary initiative, and
there is the independent activity of a proletariat that is undeveloped and is
held in Leading-strings; there is a consciously Social-Democratic independent
activity, and there is a Zubatovist independent activity. And there are
Social-Democrats who to this day contemplate with reverence the second kind of
independent activity, who believe that they can evade a direct reply to the
pressing questions of the day by repeating the word âclassâ over and
over again. We need but take No. 84 of Iskra. âWhy,â asks its
âleader-istâ, bearing down on us with a triumphant air, âwhy
was it not the narrow organisation of professional revolutionaries, but the
Workersâ Assembly that set this avalanche in motion [January 9]? Because
this Assembly was a really [mark this!] broad organisation. based on
the independent activity of the working-class masses.â If the author of
this classical phrase were not an admirer of Martynov, he might have understood
that the Assembly rendered a service to the movement of the
revolutionary proletariat only when and to the extent that it passed
from Zubatovist independent
activity to Social-Democratic in dependent activity (after which it immediately
ceased to exist as a legally functioning organisation).


Had the new-Iskrists, or the new-Rabocheye Dyelo-ists not been
tail-enders, they would have realised that it was the Ninth of January that
justified those who had said that
â...in the long run the legalisation of the working-class movement will
be to our advantage, and not to that of the Zubatovsâ (What
Is To Be

      Done?[3]

).

It was the Ninth of January

    

that proved again and again the importance of the task formulated in that
      pamphlet: â...we must prepare reapers, both to cut down the tares of
      today [paralyse todayâs corrupting influence of the Zubatov movement]
    and to reap the wheat of tomorrowâ (give a revolutionary lead
    to the movement that has advanced a step with the aid of legalisation). The
    Simple Simons of the new Iskra, however, use the bountiful wheat
    harvest as a pretext for minimising the importance of a strong organisation
    of revolutionary reapers.


It would be criminal, the new-Iskra leader-writer continues, âto
attack the revolution in the rearâ. What this sentence means, God only
knows. As to its bearing on the general opportunist complexion of
Iskra, we shall probably deal with the point on another occasion. Here
it will suffice to indicate that this sentence can have but one true political
meaning, namely, that the author grovels in the dust before the rear of the
revolution and disdainfully turns up his nose at the ânarrowâ and
âJacobinâ van of the revolution.


The more the new Iskra displays its Martynovist zeal, the clearer
becomes the contrast between the tactics of tailism and the tactics of
revolutionary Social-Democracy. We pointed out in the first issue of

   Vperyod[4]

that an up rising must connect itself with one of the
spontaneous movements. Consequently, we do not in the least forget the
importance of âguarding the rearâ, to employ a military
term. In
Vperyod,

       No. 4,[5]

we referred to the correct tactics of the
St. Petersburg Committee members, who from the outset directed all their efforts
towards supporting and developing the revolutionary elements in the spontaneous
movement, while at the same time maintaining an attitude of reserve and distrust
towards the shady, Zubatov rear of that movement. We shall conclude now with a
piece of advice, which no doubt we shall have to repeat more than once to the
new-Iskrists: Do not minimise the tasks of the revolutionâs vanguard, do not
forget our obligation to support this van guard by our organised
independent activity. Use fewer

    

platitudes about the development of the independent activity of the
workers—the workers display no end of independent revolutionary activity
which you do not notice!—but see to it rather that you do not demoralise
undeveloped workers by your own tail-ism.

Revolutsionnaya Rossiya, No. 58, says: âMay the spirit of
fighting unity now at long last pervade the ranks of the revolutionary socialist
groups, which are torn by fratricidal animosity, and may it revive the
consciousness of socialist solidarity which has been so criminally
sapped.... Let us spare the revolutionary forces as much as we can and increase
their effectiveness by means of a concerted attack!â


We have often had occasion to protest against the tyranny of the phrase among
the Socialists-Revolutionaries, and we must do so again. Why these frightful
words,

gentle men, 

about âfratricidal animosityâ and so forth? Are
they worthy of a revolutionary? Now of all times, when the real fight is on,
when blood is flowing—the blood of which Revolutsionnaya Rossiya
speaks in such flamboyant terms, these grotesque exaggerations about
âfratricidal animosityâ ring falser than ever. Spare the forces, say
you? But surely this is done by a united, welded organisation which
is at one on questions of principle, and not by lumping together heterogeneous
elements. Strength is not spared but wasted by such barren attempts at
lumping. To achieve a âfighting unityâ in deed and not merely in
word, we must know clearly, definitely, and from experience exactly
wherein and to what extent we can be united. Without this, all
talk of fighting unity will be mere words, words, words; this knowledge, incidentally, comes from the very controversy, struggle, and animosity of
which you speak in such âfrightfulâ terms. Would it really be better
if we hushed up the differences that divide vast sections of Russian public
opinion and Russian socialist thought? Was it only the âcult of discordâ that provoked the bitter struggle between Narodism,

    

that nebulous ideology of the democratic bourgeoisie woven of socialistic
dreams, and Marxism, the ideology of the proletariat? Nonsense, gentlemen; you
only make

your selves 

 ridiculous by saying such things, by continuing to regard
as an âinsultâ the Marxist view that Narodism and your
âsocial-revolutionismâ are essentially bourgeois-democratic. We
shall inevitably argue, differ, and quarrel also in the future revolutionary
committees in Russia, but surely we must learn from history. We must not have
unexpected, unintelligible, and muddled disputes at a time when action is
called for; we must be prepared to argue on fundamental issues, to know the
points of departure of each trend, to anticipate possible unity or possible
antagonism. The history of revolutionary epochs provides many, all too many,
instances of tremendous harm caused by hasty and half-baked experiments in
âfighting unityâ that sought to lump together the most heterogeneous
elements in the committees of the revolutionary people, but managed thereby to
achieve mutual friction and bitter disappointment.


We want to profit by this lesson of history. Marxism, which to you seems a
narrow dogma, is to us the quintessence of this historical lesson and
guidance. We see in the independent, uncompromisingly Marxist party of
the revolutionary proletariat the sole pledge of socialismâs victory and the
road to victory that is most free from vacillations. We shall never, therefore,
not even at the most revolutionary moments, forego the complete independence of
the Social-Democratic Party or the complete intransigence of our ideology.


You believe this rules out fighting unity? You are mistaken. You can
see from the resolution of our Second Congress that we do not renounce
agreements for the struggle and in the struggle. In Vperyod, No. 4, we
stressed the fact that the beginning of the revolution in Russia undoubtedly
brings closer the moment when such agreements can be practically

     implemented.[1]

A joint struggle of the revolutionary Social-Democrats and the revolutionary
elements of the democratic movement is inevitable and indispensable in the era
of the fall of the autocracy. We think that we should serve

    

the cause of future militant agreements better if, instead of indulging in
      bitter recriminations, we sanely and coolly weighed the conditions under
      which they would become possible and the likely limits of their
      âjurisdictionâ, if one may use the term. We began this work in
    Vperyod, No. 3, in which we undertook a study of the progress of
    the Socialist-Revolutionary Party from Narodism to

       Marxism.[2]


âThe masses took to arms themselves,â Revolutsionnaya Rossiya
wrote in connection with the Ninth of January. âSooner or later, without
doubt, the question of arming the masses will be decided.â âThat is when
the fusion between terrorism and the mass movement, to which we are striving by
word and deed in accordance with the entire spirit of our Party tactics, will be
manifested and realised in the most striking manner.â (We would remark
parenthetically that we would gladly put a question mark after the word
âdeedâ; but let us proceed with the quotation.) âNot so long
ago, before our own eyes, these two factors of the movement were separate, and
this separateness deprived them of their full force.â


What is true is true! Exactly! Intelligentsia terrorism and the mass movement of
the working class were separate, and this separateness deprived them of
their full force. That is precisely what the revolutionary Social-Democrats
have been saying all along. For this very reason they have always been opposed
to terrorism and to all the vacillations towards terrorism which members of the
intellectualist wing of our Party have often

     displayed.[3]

For this reason
precisely the old Iskra took a position against terrorism when it wrote
in issue No. 48: âThe terrorist struggle of the old type was the
riskiest form of revolutionary struggle, and those who en gaged in it had the
reputation of being resolute, self-sacrificing people.... Now, however, when
demonstrations develop into acts of open resistance to the government, ... the
old terrorism ceases to be an exceptionally daring method of
struggle.... Heroism has now come out into the open; the

    

true heroes of our time are now the revolutionaries who lead the popular masses,
which are rising against their oppressors.... The terrorism of the great French
Revolution ... began on July 14, 1789, with the storming of the Bastille. Its
strength was the strength of the revolutionary movement of the
people.... That terrorism was due, not to disappointment in the
strength of the mass movement, but, on the contrary, to âunshakable faith in its
strength.... The history of that terrorism is exceedingly instructive
for the Russian

   revolutionary.â[4]


Yes, a thousand times yes! The history of that terrorism is
instructive in the extreme. Instructive, too, are the quoted passages from
Iskra, which refer to an epoch of eighteen months ago. These quotations
show us, in their full stature, the ideas which even the Socialists-Revolutionaries, under the influence of the revolutionary lessons, would like to arrive
at. They remind us of the importance of faith in the mass movement;
they remind us of revolutionary tenacity, which comes only from high principles
and which alone can safeguard us against the âdisappointmentsâ
induced by a prolonged apparent standstill of the movement. Now, after
the Ninth of January, there can be no question, on the face of it, of any
âdisappointmentsâ in the mass movement. But only on the face of
it. We should distinguish between the momentary âattractionâ evoked
by a striking display of mass heroism and the steadfast, reasoned convictions
that link inseparably the entire activity of the Party with the movement of the
masses, owing to the paramount importance which is attached to the principle of
the class struggle. We should bear in mind that the revolutionary movement,
however high its level since the Ninth of January, still has many stages to pass
through before our socialist and democratic parties will be reconstructed on a
new basis in a free Russia. And through all these stages, through all the
vicissitudes of the struggle, we must maintain the ties between
Social-Democracy and the class struggle of the proletariat

    

 unbroken, and we must see to it that they are continuously strengthened
      and made more secure.


It seems to us, therefore, a gross exaggeration for Revolutsionnaya
Rossiya to assert that âthe pioneers of the armed struggle were
swallowed up in the ranks of the roused masses....â This is the desirable future
rather than the reality of the moment. The assassination of Sergei in
Moscow on February 17 (4),[5]

which has been reported by telegraph this very day, is
obviously an act of terrorism of the old type. The pioneers of the armed
struggle have not yet been swallowed up in the ranks of the roused
masses. Pioneers with bombs evidently lay in wait for Sergei in Moscow while the
masses (in St. Petersburg), without pioneers, without arms, without
revolutionary officers, and without a revolutionary staff âflung
themselves in implacable fury upon bristling bayonetsâ, as this same
Revolutsionnaya Rossiya expresses it. The separateness of which we
spoke above still exists, and the individual intellectualist terror
shows all the more strikingly its inadequacy in face of the growing realisation
that âthe masses have risen to the stature of individual heroes, that
mass heroism has been awakened in themâ (Revolutsionnaya Rossiya,
No. 58). The pioneers should submerge among the masses in actual fact,
that is, exert their selfless energies in real inseparable connection with the
insurgent masses, and proceed with them in the literal, not figurative,
symbolical, sense of the word. That this is essential can hardly be open to
doubt now. That it is possible has been proved by the Ninth of January and by
the deep unrest which is still smouldering among the working-class masses. The
fact that this is a new, higher, and more difficult task in comparison with the
preceding ones cannot and should not stop us from meeting it at once
in a practical way.


Fighting unity between the Social-Democratic Party and the
revolutionary-democratic party—the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, might
be one way of facilitating the solution of this problem. Such unity will be all
the more practicable, the sooner the pioneers of the armed struggle are
âswallowed upâ in the ranks of the insurgent masses, the more firmly
the Socialists-Revolutionaries follow the path which they themselves have
charted in the words, âMay

    

these beginnings of fusion between revolutionary terrorism and the mass movement
grow and strengthen, may the masses act as quickly as possible, armed cap-à-pie
with terrorist methods of struggle!â With a view to bringing about speedily
such a fighting unity, we take pleasure in publishing the following letter which
we have received from Georgi
Gapon:



âAn Open Letter to the Socialist Parties of Russia.


âThe bloody January days in St. Petersburg and the rest of Russia have
brought the oppressed working class face to face with the autocratic regime,
headed by the blood-thirsty tsar. The great Russian revolution has begun. All to
whom the peopleâs freedom is really dear must either win or die. Realising the
importance of the present historic moment, considering the present state of
affairs, and being above all a revolutionary and a man of action, I call upon
all the socialist parties of Russia to enter immediately into an agreement among
themselves and to proceed to the armed uprising against tsarism. All the forces
of every party should be mobilised. All should have a single technical plan of
action. Bombs and dynamite, individual and mass terror—every thing that
can help the popular uprising. The immediate aim is the over throw of the
autocracy, a provisional revolutionary government which will at once amnesty all
fighters for political and religious liberties, at once arm the people, and at
once convoke a Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal, equal, and direct
suffrage by secret ballot. To the task, comrades! Onward to the fight! Let us
repeat the slogan of the St. Petersburg workers on the Ninth of
January—Freedom or Death! Delay and disorder now are a crime against the
people, whose interests you are defending. Having given all of myself to the
service of the people, from whom I myself am sprung (the son of a peasant), and
having thrown in my lot irrevocably with the struggle against the oppressors and
exploiters of the working class, I shall naturally be heart and soul with those
who will undertake the real business of actually liberating the proletariat and
all the toiling masses from the capitalist yoke and political slavery.


âGeorgi Gapon.â



On our part, we consider it necessary to state our view of this letter as
clearly and as definitely as possible. We consider that the
âagreementâ it proposes is possible, useful, And essential. We
welcome the fact that Gapon speaks explicitly of an âagreementâ,
since only through the preservation of complete independence by each separate
party on points of principle and organisation can the efforts at a fighting
unity of these parties rest on hope. We must be very careful, in making these
endeavours, not to spoil things by vainly trying to lump together heterogeneous
elements.

    

We shall inevitably have to getrennt marschieren (march separately),
    but we can vereint schlagen (strike together) more than once and
    particularly now. It would be desirable, from our point of view, to have
    this agreement embrace the revolutionary as well as the socialist
    parties, for there is nothing socialistic in the immediate aim of the
    struggle, and we must not confound or allow anyone ever to confound the
    immediate democratic aims with our ultimate aims of socialist revolution. It
    would be desirable, and from our point of view essential, for the
    agreement that, instead of a general call for âindividual and
    mass terrorâ, it should be stated openly and definitely that this
    joint action pursues the aim of a direct and actual fusion between
    terrorism and the uprising of the masses. True, by adding the words
    âeverything that can help the popular uprisingâ, Gapon clearly
    indicates his desire to make even individual terror subservient to this
    aim; but this desire, which suggests the idea that we noted in
    Revolutsionnaya Rossiya, No. 58, should be expressed more
    definitely and embodied in absolutely unequivocal practical decisions. We
    should like, finally, to point out, regardless of the realisability of the
    proposed agreement, that Gaponâs extra-party stand seems to us to be another
    negative factor. Obviously, with so rapid a conversion from faith in the
    tsar and petitioning of the tsar to revolutionary aims, Gapon was not able
    to evolve for himself immediately a clear revolutionary outlook. This is
    inevitable, and the faster and broader the revolution develops, the more
    often will this kind of thing occur. Nevertheless, complete clarity and
    definiteness in the relations between parties, trends, and shades are
    absolutely necessary if a temporary agreement among them is to be in any
    way successful. Clarity and definiteness will be needed at every practical
    step; they will be the pre-condition for definiteness and the absence of
    vacillation in the real, practical work. The beginning of the
    revolution in Russia will probably lead to the emergence upon the political
    arena of many people and perhaps trends representing the view that the
    slogan ârevolutionâ is, for âmen of actionâ, a quite
    adequate definition of their aims and their methods of operation. Nothing
    could be more fallacious than this opinion. The extra-party position, which
    seems higher, or more convenient,

    

or more âdiplomaticâ, is in actual fact
more vague, more obscure, and inevitably fraught with inconsistencies
and vacillations in practical activity. In the interests of the revolution our
ideal should by no means be that all parties, all trends and shades of opinion
fuse in a revolutionary chaos. On the contrary, the growth and spread of the
revolutionary movement, its constantly deeper penetration among the various
classes and strata of the people, will inevitably give rise (all to the good) to
constantly newer trends and shades. Only full clarity and definiteness in their
mutual relations and in their attitude towards the position of the revolutionary
proletariat can guarantee maximum success for the revolutionary movement. Only
full clarity in mutual relations can guarantee the success of an agreement to
achieve a common immediate aim.


This immediate aim is outlined quite correctly, in our opinion, in
Gaponâs letter, namely: (1) the overthrow of the autocracy; (2) a
provisional revolutionary government; (3) the immediate amnesty to all fighters
for political and religious liberties, including, of course, the right to
strike, etc.; (4) the immediate arming of the people; and (5) the immediate
convocation of an All-Russian Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal,
equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot. The immediate translation into life
by the revolutionary government of complete equality for all citizens and
complete political freedom during elections is, of course, taken for granted by
Gapon; but this might have been stated explicitly. It would be advisable also to
include in the general policy of the provisional government the establishment
everywhere of revolutionary peasant committees for the purpose of supporting
the democratic revolution and putting into effect its various measures. The
success of the revolution depends largely on the revolutionary activity of the
peasantry itself, and the various socialist and revolutionary-democratic parties
would probably agree on a slogan such as we have suggested.


It is to be hoped that Gapon, whose evolution from views shared by a politically
unconscious people to revolutionary views proceeds from such profound personal
experiences, will achieve the clear revolutionary outlook that is essential for
a man of politics. It is to be hoped that

    

his appeal for a militant agreement for the uprising will meet with success, and
      that the revolutionary proletariat, side by side with the revolutionary
      democrats, will strike at the autocracy and overthrow it all the more
      quickly and surely, and with the least sacrifices.

It happened a long, long time ago, more than a year ago. According to the
testimony of the not unknown German Social-Democrat, Parvus, âfundamental
differencesâ had arisen in the Russian Party. It had become the
primary political task of the party of the proletariat to combat the
extremes of
centralism, the idea of âgiving ordersâ to the workers from some
obscure Geneva and the over-estimation of the idea of an organisation of
agitators, of an organisation of leaders. Such was the deep, firm, and
unshakable conviction of the Menshevik Parvus, expressed in his weekly German
news-sheet Aus der Weltpolitik for November 30, 1903.


It was pointed out at the time to the estimable Parvus (see Leninâs letter to
the editors of Iskra,

    December 1903[1]

)

that he was the victim of a
piece of scandal-mongering, that what he took for fundamental differences were
at bottom mere squabbles, and that the shift in the new Iskraâs ideas,
which was becoming noticeable, was a shift towards opportunism. Parvus fell
silent, but his âideasâ on over-estimating the importance of an
organisation of leaders were taken up and worked to death by the new-Iskrists.


Fourteen months went by. The disruptive work of the Mensheviks within the Party
and the opportunist nature of their propaganda became perfectly clear. January
9, 1905, fully revealed the vast reserve of revolutionary energy possessed by
the proletariat, as well as the utter inadequacy of Social-Democratic
organisation. Parvus came to his senses. He wrote an article in Iskra,
No. 85, which, in
fact, was a volte-face from the new ideas of the opportunist

    

new Iskra to the ideas of the revolutionary old Iskra.
    âThere was a hero,â Parvus exclaims, referring to Gapon, âbut no
    political leader, no programme of action, no organisation.... The lack of
    organisation produced tragic results.... The masses are disunited,
    everything is without plan, there is no coalescing centre, no guiding
    programme of action.....   The movement has declined for lack of a coalescing
    and guiding organisation.â And Parvus proposes the slogan which we
    suggested in issue No. 6 of Vperyod—âOrganise the

  Revolution!â[2]

    The lessons of the revolution have convinced Parvus that âunder
    present political conditions we cannot organise the hundreds of
    thousandsâ (the reference is to the masses ready for
    revolt). âBut,â he says, repeating with good reason an idea expressed
    long ago in What Is To Be Done?, âwe can create an
    organisation that would serve as a combining ferment, and, at the moment of
    revolution, rally the hundreds of thousands to its side. We must organise
    workersâ circles which shall have a clearly defined task, namely, to prepare
    the masses for the uprising, to rally them to our side at the time of the
    uprising, and to launch the uprising when the slogan is issued.â


At last! we exclaimed with relief, when we came across these old truths buried
amid the rubbish of the new Iskra. At last the revolutionary instinct
of a functionary of the proletarian party has prevailed, if only temporarily,
over Rabocheye Dyelo opportunism. At last we hear the voice of a
Social-Democrat who does not cringe before the revolutionâs rearguard but
fearlessly points to the need for supporting the van of the revolution.


The new-Iskrists, of course, could not agree with Parvus. âWe do not share
all the views expressed by Comrade Parvus,â says the editorsâ note.


We should say not! Catch them âsharingâ views which hit out at all
the opportunist nonsense they have been spewing for the last eighteen months!


âOrganise the Revolution!â But have we not our wise Comrade Martynov, who
knows that a revolution is caused by a complete change in social relations, that
a revolution cannot be timed? Martynov will point out to Parvus

    

his mistake and prove that even if the latter had in mind the organisation of
the vanguard of the revolution, it is nevertheless a ânarrowâ and
noxious âJacobinâ idea. Besides, our wise Martynov has a
Tryapichkin[4]

on a string in the shape of Martov, who is capable of
rendering his teacher more profound and who can well substitute the slogan
âUnleash the Revolution!â for the slogan âOrganise the
Revolution!â (see No. 85; the authorâs italics).


Yes, dear reader, this is the slogan we are given in Iskraâs leading
article. These days, apparently, it is enough to âunleashâ oneâs
tongue for a free chatter-process, or for the process of chatter, in order to be
able to write leading articles. The opportunist invariably requires slogans
that, on closer scrutiny, are found to be nothing but high-sounding phases,
nothing but decadent word-jugglery.


âOrganise, and again organise!â Parvus urges, for all the world as if he
had turned Bolshevik. He does not understand, poor fellow, that organisation is
a process (Iskra, No. 85, as well as all the previous numbers of the
new Iskra, particularly the magnificent feuilletons of the
magnificent Rosa). He does not know, poor devil, that according to the whole
spirit of dialectical materialism, tactics are as much a process as organisation
is. Like a âconspiratorâ he runs about with his
organisation-as-plan. Like a âutopianâ, he imagines that one can
simply up and organise the thing offhand at some, God forbid, Second or Third
Congress.


The âJacobinâ Pillars of Hercules this Parvus talks him self up to!
âTo launch the uprising when the slogan

is is suedâ—imagine 

that! It
is even worse than the idea of âtimingâ the uprising, which has been
exploded by our redoubtable Martynov. Really, Parvus ought to take a lesson or
two from Martynov. He should read Iskra, No. .62; the leading article
will tell him of the harmful âutopianâ ideas about
preparing the insurrection, which were spread so prematurely in our Party in
1902 and 1904. He should read Axelrodâs foreword to âA Workerâsâ
pamphlet to learn what âa deep-seated, harmful canker [sic!],
downright destructive to the Partyâ, Social-Democracy is threatened with
on the part of people who âpin all their hopes on spontaneous revolts of
the most backward, least class-conscious, and positively uncivilised [!]
elements of the massesâ.

 

Parvus admits that it is impossible at present to organise the hundreds of
      thousands, and he considers it our primary task âto create an
      organisation that would serve as a combining fermentâ. How can the
      new-Iskrists help squirming when such things appear in the columns of
      their paper? Obviously, an organisation that will serve as a combining
      ferment is simply an organisation of professional revolutionaries, at the
      mere mention of which our new Iskrists go off into a swoon.


We are grateful indeed to Iskra for its leading article, which it has
printed alongside Parvusâs. How marked is the contrast between this empty,
muddled phrase-mongering of the tail-ender and the clear, distinct, forthright,
and bold revolutionary slogans of the old Iskra. Is it not sheer
bombast to say that âthe policy of confidence is quitting the stage
never again to fool Russia or Europeâ? As a matter of fact, any issue
of a European bourgeois newspaper shows that this fooling is still being carried
on with success. âModerate Russian liberalism has been dealt its death-blow.â It
is childish political naivete to believe liberalism dead when it is merely
trying to be âpoliticâ and to lie low. Liberalism is very much
alive, it has taken on a new lease of life. Indeed, it is now on the threshold
of power. The reason it is lying low is that it wants to make its bid for power
at the right moment with the greatest certainty of success and the least
risk. For this reason it is so assiduously making up to the working class. One
must be hopelessly short sighted to take this flirtation (a hundred times more
dangerous for being practised at the moment) seriously and to declare
boastfully that âthe proletariat—the liberator of the country, the
proletariat—the vanguard of the whole nation, has now had its heroic
role recognised by the public opinion of the progressive elements of the
liberal-democratic bourgeoisie.â Gentlemen of the new Iskra, when will
you under stand that the liberal bourgeoisie acknowledges the proletariat as
hero for the very reason that this proletariat, though dealing a blow
at tsarism, is not yet strong enough, not yet Social-Democratic enough, to
win for itself the kind of freedom it wants. When will you
understand that what we must do is not to boast about the present bowing and
scraping of the liberals, but to warn the proletariat

    

against it and show up what lies behind it. You do not see that? Then look at
what the industrialists, merchants, and stockbrokers are saying about
the necessity of a constitution. How plainly these declarations speak of the
death of moderate liberalism! The liberal windbags prate about the heroism of
the proletarians, while the industrialists weightily and imperiously demand a
skimpy constitution— that is how matters stand,

   dear âleadersâ![3]


But nothing can compare with Iskraâs arguments on the question of
arming. âThe work of arming the proletariat and systematically building up
the organisation which shall guarantee that the peopleâs attack upon the
government shall take place simultaneously everywhereâ is declared to be a
âtechnicalâ (?!) job. And we, of course, are above such trivialities
as technique, we go to the root of things. âImportant though they are
(the âtechnicalâ jobs), it is not upon them that our efforts should be
concentrated in preparing the masses for revolt.... All the efforts of the
underground organisations will count for nothing if they fail to arm the people
with the one indispensable weapon—a sense of the burning necessity to
attack the autocracy and to arm for the purpose. It is on propaganda
among the masses to arm themselves for the purpose of revolt that we should
concentrate our efforts.â (The italics in the last two passages are the
authorâs.)


This is indeed a profound way of stating the issue, nothing like the
narrow-minded Parvus, who almost reached the point of
âJacobinismâ. The crux of the matter is not in the work of arming or
in the systematic building up of the organisation, but in arming the people with
a sense of the burning necessity to arm. What a painful feeling of

    

shame for Social-Democracy comes upon one at the sight of these philistine
      platitudes, which seek to drag our movement back! To arm the people with a
      sense of the burning necessity to arm is the constant, common duty of the
      Social-Democrats always and everywhere, and it can be applied equally to
      Japan as it can to England, to Germany as it can to Italy. Wherever there
      are oppressed classes struggling against exploitation, the doctrine of the
      socialists, from the very start, and in the first place, arms them with a
      sense of the burning necessity to arm, and this
    ânecessityâ is present when the labour movement
    begins. Social-Democracy has only to make this burning necessity a
    conscious one, to bring home to those who are conscious of it the need for
    organisation and planned action, the need for considering the whole
    political situation. Dear Editor of Iskra! Please drop in at any
    meeting of German workers and see the hatred towards, let us say, the
    police, that burns in the faces there; what bitter sarcasms and clenched
    fists you will hear and see there! What is the force that holds in check
    this burning necessity to mete out summary justice to the bourgeoisie and
    its servitors who ill-use the people? It is the force of organisation and
    discipline, the force of consciousness, the consciousness that individual
    acts of assassination are absurd, that the hour for the serious
    revolutionary struggle of the people has not yet struck, that the political
    situation is not ripe for it. That is why, under such circumstances, no
    socialist will ever bid the people arm, but he will always make it his duty
    (otherwise he is no socialist, but a mere windbag) to arm them with a sense
    of the burning necessity to arm and attack the enemy. However, the
    conditions in Russia today differ from these everyday conditions of work;
    therefore, the revolutionary Social-Democrats, who until now have never
    issued a call to arms but have always equipped the workers with a sense of
    the burning necessity to arm—therefore, the revolutionary
    Social-Democrats, following the initiative of the revolutionary workers,
    have now issued the slogan, To arms! At such a time, when
    this slogan has at last been issued, Iskra delivers itself of the
    statement that the main thing is not arming, but the burning necessity to
    arm. What is this but sterile intellectualist logic-chopping and hopeless
    Tryapichkin-ism? Are not these people dragging

    

the Party back, away from the pressing tasks of the revolutionary vanguard to
the contemplation of the proletariatâs âposteriorâ? This unbelievable
vulgarisation of our tasks is due not to the individual qualities of one or
other Tryapichkin, but to their entire position, which has been so inimitably
formulated in the catchwords organisation-as-process and
tactics-as-process. Such a position in itself necessarily condemns a man to
fear all definite slogans, to shy at all âplansâ, to back away from
bold revolutionary initiative, to philosophise and chew the cud, to be in fear
of running too far ahead—and this at a time when we Social-Democrats are
obviously lagging behind the proletariat in revolutionary activity. Truly the
dead are clutching at the living; the dead theories of Rabocheye Dyelo
lie like a dead hand upon the new Iskra too.


Let us consider Iskraâs arguments regarding âthe politically
leading role of Social-Democracy as the vanguard of the class destined to
emancipate the nationâ. âWe can neither attain that role,â we are
told, ânor firmly establish our title to it even if we take over full
control of the technical organisation and conduct of the uprising.â Think of it!
We cannot attain the role of vanguard even if we succeed in taking full control
of the conduct of the uprising! And these people presume to speak of vanguard!
They fear history will impose upon them the leading role in the
democratic revolution, and they are terrified at the thought of having
âto conduct the uprisingâ. The thought lurks at the back of their
minds—only they do not yet dare to voice it outright in the columns of
Iskra—that the Social-Democratic organisation must not
âconduct the uprisingâ, that it must not strive to take full control
over the revolutionary transition to the democratic republic. They scent in
this, these incorrigible Girondists of socialism, monstrous
Jacobinism.[5]

They
do not understand that the harder we strive to take full control of the conduct
of the uprising, the greater will our share in the undertaking be, and that the
greater this share is, the less will the influence of the anti-proletarian or
non-proletarian democrats be. They are determined to be at the tail-end; they
have even invented a philosophy of their own to prove that the tail-end is the
right place for them. Martynov has actually begun to expound this philosophy,

    

and tomorrow, no doubt, he will dot the iâs in the columns of Iskra.


Let us try to follow the argument step by step:


âThe class-conscious proletariat, governed by the logic of the spontaneous
process of historical development, will utilise for its own purposes all the
elements of organisation, all the elements of ferment which the eve of the
revolution creates....â


Fine! But to utilise all elements means to assume full
leadership. Iskra defeats its own purpose and, realising this, hastens
to add:


â...wholly undismayed by the fact that· all these elements rob it of a
share in the technical leadership of the revolution itself and thus
involuntarily help to carry our demands to the most backward sections of the
masses.â


Can you make anything of this, dear reader? To utilise all elements,
undismayed by the fact that they rob us of a share in the
leadership?! But, hold on, gentlemen, if we really utilise all
elements, if it is really our demands that are adopted by those we
utilise, then they do not rob us of the leadership, but accept
our leadership. If, on the other hand, all these elements really rob us
of the leadership (and of course not only âtechnicalâ leadership,
because to separate the âtechnicalâ side of a revolution from its
political side is sheer nonsense), then it is not we who utilise them, but they
us.


âWe should be only too glad if, following the priest who popularised among
the masses our demand for the separation of the Church from the State, if,
following the monarchist workersâ society which arranged the popular procession
to the Winter Palace, the Russian revolution would find it self the richer by a
general, who would be the first to lead the masses in the last fight against the
tsarâs troops, or by a government official who would be the first to proclaim
the formal overthrow of the rule of the tsars.â


Yes, we too should be glad of it, but we should not want a feeling of joy over
pleasant prospects to overshadow our sense of logic. What is meant by
the Russian revolution finding itself the richer by a priest or a
general? What is meant is that the priest or the general will become an adherent

    

 or leader of the revolution. These âtyrosâ may be fully or not
quite fully conscious adherents of the revolution. In the latter event (which is
the more probable with tyros) we must deplore, not welcome, their lack of
consciousness and do our utmost to cure and fill this lack. As long as
we leave this undone, as long as the masses follow a leader who is lacking in
consciousness, we have to admit that it is not the Social-Democrats who utilise
these elements, but vice versa. Yesterdayâs priest, general, or government
official who becomes an adherent of the revolution, may be a prejudice-ridden
bourgeois democrat, and insofar as the workers will follow him the
bourgeois democrats will be âutilisingâ the workers. Is this clear
to you, gentlemen of the new Iskra? If it is, then why do you
fear the assumption of leadership by the fully conscious (that
is, Social-Democratic) adherents of the revolution? Why do you fear lest a
Social-Democratic officer (I purposely select an analogous example) and member
of the Social-Democratic organisation assume, âcompletely take
overâ, the functions and tasks of your hypothetical general at the
initiative and on the instructions of that organisation?


To return to Parvus. He concludes his excellent article with the excellent
advice to get rid of the disorganisers by âthrowing them
overboardâ. To get rid of the disorganisers is, as the items in our Party
News column show,[6]

the most impassioned and emphatic slogan of the
majority of the Russian Social-Democrats. Precisely, Comrade Parvus, they must
be âthrown overboardâ in the most ruthless fashion, and the throwing
must start with those heroes of the Social-Democratic press who have,
been sanctioning disruption by their organisation-as-process and
organisation-as-tendency âtheoriesâ. The thing is not
merely to talk of
it, but to do it. We must convene immediately a congress of all Party
workers who wish to organise the Party. We must not confine ourselves to
persuasion and to appeals, but must put a direct and inexorable ultimatum to
all who hesitate, to all who waver, vacillate, and doubt:
âMake your choice!â From the first issue of our newspaper we have sounded
that ultimatum on behalf of the Editorial Board of Vperyod, on behalf
of the mass of Russian Party workers who have been driven to intense
exasperation by the

    

disorganisers. Make haste, then, and throw them overboard, comrades, and let us
      settle down to the work of organisation with a hearty good will. Better a
      hundred revolutionary Social-Democrats who have accepted
      organisation-as-plan than a thousand intellectuals of the Tryapichkin
      tribe who prattle about organisation-as-process.

The above lines bad been written when we received from the liberal camp
the following information, which is not without interest. The
St. Petersburg special correspondent of the German bourgeois-democratic
newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung (February 17, 1905) quotes a
liberal St. Petersburg journalist on the political situation:
âThe liberals would be fools to let a moment like the present slip by. The
liberals now hold all the trumps, for they have succeeded in hitching
the workers to their cart, whereas the government has no one, since
the bureaucracy does not give anyone a chance to get ahead.â  What sublime
simplicity must be reigning in the new Iskra for them to be
writing about the death of liberalism at such a moment!—Lenin
 



[4]

Tryaptchkin—a type of unscrupulous journalist
mentioned in
 Gogolâs comedy The Inspector-General.




[5]

The Mountain and the Gironde—designation of
the two political groupings of the bourgeoisie at the time of the French
bourgeois revolution towards the end of the eighteenth century. The Mountain,
or Jacobins, was the name given to the more consistent representatives of the
revolutionary class of the time, the bourgeoisie,

   

who advocated the abolition of absolutism and feudalism. Unlike the Jacobins,
the Girondists wavered between revolution and counter-revolution, and entered
into deals with the monarchy.


Lenin called the opportunist trend in Social-Democracy the âSocialist
Girondeâ, and the revolutionary Social-Democrats—proletarian
Jacobins, the âMountainâ. After the R.S.D.L.P. split into Bolsheviks
and Mensheviks, Lenin frequently stressed that the Mensheviks were the
Girondist trend in the working-class movement.





[6]

Lenin has in view the item âDisorganisation of the
Local Commit teesâ and the resolutions of the Minsk and Odessa groups of
the Social-Democrats published in Vperyod, No. 7, February 21(8),
1905,
 in the Party News column.

The Editorial Board of Vperyod can only state that it is completely in
sympathy with the initiative of the Russian Bureau. At last an energetic step
has been made towards a way out of the situation created by the
Bonapartists abroad,[2]

and a way out along Party lines! In our Party News
column we publish reports showing the alacrity with which the committees are
responding to the call issued by the Bureau. May their example be followed by
each and every group and organisation, as well as by
individuals who consider themselves members of the R.S.D.L.P. or who at least
stand close to it in their views and sympathies. The Third Congress is the
first to be convened under conditions whereby its composition (as set
forth in the Party Rules), its proceedings, and the basis of participation are
known beforehand. Let all comrades then make the most of these conditions! Let
them not forget that our Party Rules guarantee to everybody an opportunity to
appeal to the Congress. (See Clause 10: âEvery Party member, as well as
any person having any dealings with the Party, has the right to demand
that any statement he may submit to the Central Committee, to the Editorial
Board of the Central Organ, or to a Party Congress be delivered in the
original.â) Let everyone take
advantage of this opportunity immediately. The Editorial Board of
Vperyod undertakes to deliver such statements to the Russian Bureau,
which has now been constituted as the Organising Committee of the Congress. The
right to vote at the Congress is restricted to representatives of committees and
of other qualified Party organisations as defined by the Rules. But the Congress
itself may extend to everyone the right of

    

participation with consultative voice, while the Organising Committee
    may grant this right to delegates from Party organisations not possessing
    full-rights status. (Clause 3, Note 2, of the Party Rules: âThe
    Central Committee is authorised to invite to a congress, with consultative
    voice, delegates from organisations which do not fulfil the conditions
    stipulated in Note 1,â viz., organisations whose qualification has not been
    confirmed a year prior to the Congress.


It goes without saying that when the Organising Committee is instructed by the
majority of the committees to convene a congress against the will of the
Bonapartist Central Committee and Council, it takes over all the rights of the
C. C. with regard to such convocation.)


The Editorial Board of Vperyod proposes to the Congress the following
tentative agenda: (1) Constitution of the Congress (standing orders,
report of the Organising Committee, examination of credentials). (2) Delegatesâ
reports. (3) The Party

       crisis.[1]

(4) Organisational question.

(5) Attitude
towards insurrection.

(6) Agreement with the revolutionary democrats for
purposes of the insurrection.

 (7) Attitude towards the liberals.

(8) Work among
the peasantry and sup port of the revolutionary peasant movement.

(9) Work among
the troops.

 (10) Improvement of propaganda and agitation.

 (11) Election of officers.


The active participation of all Party members in drafting and preparing reports
and resolutions on these and other major questions (as well as in the collection
of material for reports) is absolutely essential for the success of the
Congress. We call upon all adherents of the Party principle to start on this
work at once. Everyone who has been involved in one way or other in the
trials and tribulations of the Party crisis can help the Congress by a brief
statement of his experiences and his view of the way out. Everyone who
has worked in any Party or Party-connected organisation can give

    

invaluable information,based on personal experience, for solving various aspects
of the organisational question. (The contributions might cover such points as
time and place of the activity; membership of the particular organisation—
number of workers and number of intellectuals; the relations between them;
whether written rules are needed, and which; whether there should be any fixed
rules—and if so, to what extent—governing the limits of autonomy and
of the division of labour of the groups belonging to the Party or connected with
it, co-optation and expulsion of members; the elective principle; the attitude
of the committees to the groups of propagandists, agitators, and organisers, to
the district circles and factory circles, to the publicistsâ committees,
technical committees, etc., etc.)


The Vperyod Editorial Board has already received some material on work
among the peasants and the soldiers. We know of one group which is working
systematically on a summary of the experience acquired by its members
in the field of propaganda, agitation, and organisation, and is preparing a
report for the Congress. We have been promised the report of a comrade who
helped to organise hundreds of workers for armed resistance in the
event of an anti-jewish pogrom in a certain large city, and a report on the
question of street fighting from another comrade who has made a study of
military science. It is of the highest importance that the greatest possible
number of comrades undertake such and similar work at once.


The Party crisis has been clarified in our literature down to the minutest
detail. The discussion of this question cannot and should not take up much
time. The keynote of the Congress should be the new questions of
organisation and tactics, which are being brought to the fore by the new
gigantic upswing in our revolutionary movement. In the solution of these
questions the collective experience of all Social-Democrats who have
been in any way active in the movement will be of inestimable value. But we must
gather this experience as soon as possible and make it available for discussion
at the Congress.


To work, then, comrades! Let everyone who has the interests of the
Social-Democratic working-class movement at heart bestir himself at once to give
the Congress his active

    

aid. Then the Party will quickly emerge from this period of temporary abasement
      and enfeeblement on to the path of most active participation in the great
      Russian revolution, the path leading to victory over the accursed enemy of
      the Russian people!

 

Notes

Bebel wrote to Lenin offering his services as arbitrator between the
supporters of Iskra and the supporters of Vperyod. Lenin
replied that neither he nor any other Vperyod supporters within
his knowledge had the right to take any action binding upon the whole
Party, and that Bebelâs proposal would, therefore, have to he submitted to
the Party Congress that was being called by the Russian Bureau. We think
the Congress could include this proposal in the item âParty crisisâ.—Lenin

Bonapartists abroad—applied by Lenin to the Mensheviks who, in
defiance of the Party, had seized control of the Partyâs Central Organ,
Iskra, of the Central Committee, and of the Council of the
 Party.

In the leading article of Iskra, No. 87, Plekhanov, deferring suavely
to Martov, successfully applies, the tactics of

    killing with kindness[1]

.

Though playing up to the author of the leading article in issue No. 85,
Plekhanov, in substance, wholly refutes him and subscribes to the very
views which Vperyod has always maintained. Congratulations! Only bear
in mind your kinship with Martynov, most honourable dialectician. Get him to
tell you about the awful and disastrous fate that lies in store for you, if,
upon having âprepared the victoryâ (slogan in issue
No. 87), you achieved it! Get him to tell you of the grave danger involved in
âthe seizure of powerâ, in âparticipation in the provisional
governmentâ, and in âthe revolutionary dictatorshipâ. Poor
Plekhanov, it will take him a long time to extricate himself from the mess in
which the pamphlets of Trotsky, Martynov, âA Workerâ, and Axelrod,
approved by the entire (?) Editorial Board have entangled him! In the supplement
to Iskra, No. 86, Popov admits to being the author
of the letter published in Leninâs âStatementâ. Which but
needed proof! The systematic deception of the Party by the gentlemen of the
Minority has been proved. As we predicted, these gentlemen are trying to get
out of it by drawing a red herring across the readerâs track in the form of the
question whether Lenin had the right to confiscate a letter that exposed the
Bonapartists. Martov and Popov, so distinguished for their moral sensitivity,
are yelling about theft, spying, and so on. Scold away, gentlemen, to your
heartsâ content. Lacking arguments, what else is left for you to do?

February 28, 1905


Dear Comrades,


We have just received the news that St. Petersburg, Tula, Moscow, the
North, Nizhni-Novgorod, the Caucasus, and Odessa have declared for the Congress,
and other places will, of course, follow suit. The Central Committee is said to
have gone on record for the Congress. Naturally, no one will believe the
C. C. now. Everyone says it may as well come to the Congress, since everyone has
been invited, but it is the Bureau and the Bureau alone that is convening the
Congress. There is hardly any need to ask why there is not a grain of confidence
left in the C.C. (even the few completely isolated voices raised in its favour
were immediately retracted). Everybody understands that the C.C. is only
deceiving people and playing the diplomat.


It is extremely important that preparations for the Congress be started
immediately and that zealous efforts be made to enlist the co-operation of all
circles, including district, propaganda, and factory circles, in short, all,
especially workersâ, circles. We speak of this also in
Vperyod,

No. 8,[1]

(out today). It would be very useful to have workers attend the Congress. (In
our opinion admittance on a consultative voice basis should be accorded as
liberally as possible. Thus, it is only a question of funds. Spread your
agitation wider. We are convinced that it is possible to find workers who will
collect from 150 to 200 rubles to cover the expenses of a delegate; special
donors for the same purpose can also be

    

found among the intellectuals.) Important questions will be discussed at the
Congress: organisation, the attitude to wards the periphery organisations, the
insurrection, arming of the workers (installation of dynamite workshops), agreement with the Socialists-Revolutionaries for an uprising, support of the
revolutionary peasant movement, and many other issues. Reports on work among the
troops and the peasantry are of the utmost importance. Make the widest possible use of contacts with officers, students, and so on for the Congress. The
Congress will be asked to substitute Leninâs formulation of Clause 1 of the
Rules for Martovâs, and to extend the rights of Party and
Party-connected organisations. This will cover many elements of
revolutionary democracy. Let each and every one prepare most actively for the
Congress.


Hearty greetings,


Lenin


St. Petersburg has begun to send us copies of the minutes of workersâ meetings
held in various districts. An example worth imitating. It is our earnest request
that the workers themselves write, and keep on writing, to Vperyod.

R e s o l u t i o n s:


1. (a) Real object of the Minority: composition of the centres.


(b) Non-compliance with Congress decisions.


(c) Split before the League Congress: formation of a secret organisation.


(d) Dishonesty of this act and all resultant disorganisation.


(e) The shame of trying to justify disruptive activities by theories concerning
organisation-as-process, organisation-as-tendency, by hypocritical cries about
bureaucratism, formalism, etc.


(f) Enormous harm done to the constructive work in Russia by their
disorganisation.


(g) Necessity of complete dissociation from the disorganisers.


(h) Authorisation to the centres to issue a pamphlet briefly setting forth the
causes and the history of the split, and notification to international
Social-Democracy.


2. (a) It is necessary to have expressions of opinion on the so-called
   conciliationist tendency.


(b) Its only honest non-hypocritical representative was Plekhanov, when he wrote
No. 52 of Iskra.


(c) Congress acknowledges the correctness of Plekhanovâs stand at the Second
Congress of the Party and at the Congress of the League, and the sincerity of
his desire for peace through co-optation.


(d) Unfortunately, Plekhanov failed to maintain his position on concessions
towards the revisionists and individualist anarchists; the attempts on his part
at justification in principle are obviously wrong and are only likely
to create confusion in peopleâs minds and introduce an element of artfulness in
inner-Party relations.

 

(e) The so-called conciliators are nothing but hypocritical Mensheviks. No
independent platform of conciliation exists other than Plekhanovâs, and
that, too, he has now rejected (personal concessions, but disputes on
points of principle with the revisionists and anarcho-individualists).


3. (a) The Congress recognises differences on points of principle between our
   position and that of the new-Iskrists.


(b) The new-Iskristsâ utter instability on points of principle goes back to the
Second Congress, where they first wholly opposed the opportunist wing and ended
up (albeit against their own will and consciousness) by turning to wards it.


(c) After the Second Congress the opportunist tendency became still more
pronounced; in the organisation itself systematic petty betrayals were
justified. The blunting of such a weapon of the proletarian class struggle as
organisation. Distortion of Marxism to the extent of justifying and extolling
disorganisation and intellectualist anarchism.


(d) In regard to questions of the general line of its policy, Iskra
should have admitted the âgulf between the new Iskra and the old
Iskraâ. A shift towards tail-ism.


(e) In tactics this was expressed in the attitude

    towards
   the liberals.
   The Zemstvo
   campaign.


 (f) ” ” ” ”   ” ” ” ”

towards the
   insurrection.
   Attempts to
   drag back
   and confuse.


 (g) ” ” ” ”   ” ” ” ”

towards arming.


 (h) ” ” ” ”   ” ” ” ”

towards demoralisation
   of the backward workers with the
   slogan âindependent activity of the
   workersâ, etc.

 

(i) On the whole, the new-Iskrists=an opportunist wing of the Party.


Basically ill-assorted elements in their camp.


{


Organisation-as-process


Party and class


Liberals and Zemstvo campaign


Insurrection


Arming


Revolutionary dictatorship


}


 Instability on questions of principle (Second Congress).


 Shift towards opportunist Rabocheye Dyelo (a gulf).


  Their approval by party-fringe
  intellectuals and open opportunists  à la Struve.


 Necessity of struggle for the
   line of the old Iskra.


4. (a) Insincere nature of the cries about a party of the
   intelligentsia. Utilised by the liberals. New-Iskrists themselves have
   disavowed it.


(b) Demagogic nature of propaganda among the workers. The âelective
principleâ, its necessity under free political conditions, its
impossibility on a wide scale in Russia.


(c) Empty words about âindependent activity of the workersâ serving
as a screen for tail-ism; they promise organisationally the
impossible, use cheap methods to decry âbureaucratismâ,
âformalismâ, etc., but give nothing; they fail to notice the
revolutionary independent activity of the workers and hang about the
lowest and most backward strata of the movement.


(d) Warn the workers. Class-conscious workers should know and bear in mind the
analogous methods of the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists; they should know and
bear in mind the position of the old Iskra, namely, the importance for
the working-class masses to advance from their midst class-conscious,
Social-Democratic workers, worker-revolutionaries, our Bebels, and the necessity
to organise every district, every factory, etc.


(e) Only the full consciousness of the advanced workers, the complete
elimination of all distinctions between intellectuals and workers within
Social-Democracy, can guarantee a Social-Democratic class party of the
proletariat.


5. (a) Necessity of immediately preparing for the uprising.



 (b) " " creating an organisation or organisations of a
 fighting character.

 

+7. (c) Necessity of increasing the number of organisations generally:
organising the revolution.


(d) Terrorism must be merged in actual practice with the movement of the masses.


(e) Aim of the insurrection: provisional revolutionary government, arming of the
people, Constituent Assembly, revolutionary peasant committees.


(f) Tasks of Social-Democrats in wielding power:
full implementation of the whole democratic programme, independent organisation
and organisations of the working class, the striving to develop the
revolutionary independent activity of the proletariat and the rural poor,
steadfast safeguarding of the class programme and point of view, and a critical
attitude towards the illusions of revolutionary democracy.


or 7: {



(g) These (preceding) conditions determine also the militant agreement between
Social-Democracy and revolutionary democracy for the insurrection.



(h) By revolutionary democracy is meant the consistent and firm
democratic currents that accept
the whole democratic programme of Social-Democracy, do not hold back from any revolutionary measures, but lack the
clear Social-Democratic

classconsciousness [sic.]


}


9. (a) Staroverâs resolution[4]

 is wrong in principle: the crux of the
   matter is not in declarations but in struggle, in the common struggle.


(b) The declarations andâ slogans of the liberals and liberal democrats do not
inspire confidence (Struve).


(c) The arbitrary and false interpretation of these groups as democratic
intelligentsia. Agreement with a force,

hut 

 the intelligentsia is not a
force. Starover has this muddled.


(d) On the order of the day an agreement not on the condition of declarations,
but on the condition of participation in the uprising, not with the
liberal democrats, but with the revolutionary democrats.


10. (a) Agreement with the Zemstvo men violates even the conditions of
Staroverâs resolution.

 

(b) As to not frightening the liberals, that is irrelevant and
      inopportune. Impossibility of justifying this by the danger of
      anarchism.


 (c) The reactionary meaning of the slogans about âa higher type
 of demonstrationsâ.


 (d) The impressionist opportunism of the new Iskra.


 (e) Abuse of words about âclass independent activityâ and
 systematic development of the class.


 (f) To publish their first letter for the edification of the young
 Party members.


 11. (a) Most important at the present time:


—N.B.:
together with the peasant bourgeoisie against the landlords, together
with the rural proletariat against the bourgeoisie.



 (b) to stress the democratic aspects,



(c) not to overlook for a single moment the

  s o c i a l i s t

(the

  e n t i r e

socialist) programme,


(d) to maintain steadfastly the standpoint of the proletariat generally and of
the rural proletariat in particular.


12


{


(e) To support the revolutionary movement of both the rural
proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie against the landlords, down to the
complete expropriation of the landlordsâ lands, without, however, in
any way indulging the illusions of petty-bourgeois socialism by
    action or inaction, but struggling
vigorously against monarchist and
Caesarist speculations on the reactionary elements
of the peasant bourgeoisie.


}


13. (a) Importance of work among the soldiers:


(b) Leaflets.


(c) Military organisation, its elements? Special military organisation may be
useful

 je nachdem.[1]



 (d)[2]



14. (a) To take the programme as a basis....


(b) Travelling groups.


(c) Lectures and agitational speeches.

 *     *  * 
 

In the basic resolution against the new-Iskrists it is important to note the
following:


(a) The negation or belittlement of the idea of a strong organisation of the
class-conscious proletariat and its

van guard, 

 the Social-Democratic Labour
Party, tends to convert the working-class movement into the tailpiece of the
bourgeois-democratic movement.


(b) This is the end-result of the demagogic belittlement of the role of the
class-conscious Social-Democratic influence on the spontaneous movement of the
proletariat and the theoretical vulgarisation of Marxism through an
interpretation that acts as a drag on revolutionary initiative and the
progressive tasks of Social-Democracy.


This is the end-result, too, of the idea of contraposing the technical and the
political leadership of the revolution and—

Resolution on the Disruptive Behaviour of the
Mensheviks, or New-Iskrists

The Congress deems it necessary to place definitely on record the conclusively
proved facts concerning the behaviour of the Mensheviks, or new-Iskrists, after
the Second Party Congress. Without even attempting to question the validity
of the decisions adopted by, and the elections held at, this Congress, they have
shamelessly flouted its decisions. Immediately after the Congress they boycotted
the central bodies it set up, and formed within the Party, and behind its back,
a separate organisation. The aim of this organisation was to foist on the
Editorial Board of the Central Organ and on the Central Committee of the Party
the six candidates who had been turned down by the Congress. To attain this
end, in opposition to the will and the interests of the Party, the Mensheviks
everywhere disorganised the Partyâs constructive work. Everywhere they secretly
split the Party and demoralised the comradely relations among the
Social-Democrats; they turned the Central Organ of the Party into an organ of
gossip and squabbles, heaping vulgar abuse on the Party committees that had
elected the central bodies and demanded from them an accounting; they reduced
the Party Council to a mere instrument of factional feuds and had no scruples
about falsifying the voice of the Party which demanded the Third Congress.


The Congress most emphatically condemns this disruptive conduct and warns all
Party-conscious Social-Democrats against the notorious organisation-as-process
theory which has been used to justify disorganisation and which has debased the
theory of revolutionary Marxism in an unheard-of manner.

 

The Congress affirms that the adherents of the Party Majority, in drawing up
      resolutions against the disorganisers and in demanding the Third Congress,
      have exhausted all the resources of honest, comradely struggle against
      fellow-members of the Party. Now that the centres set up by the Party
      have definitely cast off all responsibility to the Party, the Congress is
      compelled to consider them beyond the pale of the Party. The Congress
      declares that adherents of the Party principle have no alternative but to
      work separately from, and independently of, these disorganisers. The
      Congress therefore resolves that followers of the Minority, or new
      Iskrists, may not be admitted to membership in any organisation of our
      Party.


The Congress instructs the Central Committee of the Party to issue a small
pamphlet in explanation of this resolution, for the information of Russian and
international Social-Democracy.

2
Resolution on Plekhanovâs Conduct During the Party Crisis

The Congress admits the correctness of Plekhanovâs position at the Second Party
Congress and at the Congress of the League Abroad on the questions of programme,
tactics, and organisation. The Congress acknowledges that after the League
Congress Plekhanov, in order to restore peace within the Party and heal the
split caused by the Mensheviks, proposed a policy of concessions to people whom
he had aptly characterised before the whole Party as revisionists and
anarcho-individualists (Iskra, No. 52, November 7, 1903). The Congress
expresses deep regret that Plekhanov did not maintain this position; that,
against the will of the Party, he began to apply the most shameless methods to
secure satisfaction of all the demands of the Mensheviks; that, to justify the
Mensheviks, he lowered himself to the point of defending their stand, which he
himself had declared to be incorrect in principle, and of inventing the most
fantastic differences with the Party Majority.


The Congress emphatically condemns such crafty practices in dealing with
fellow-members of the Party; for such a policy,

    

 no matter by what humane motives in respect to certain individuals it may
be prompted, cannot but have a demoralising effect on the Party.

3
Resolution on the Theoretical Position of the New-Iskrists

The Congress considers it of imperative necessity to combat the theoretical
position of the Mensheviks, or new Iskrists, who have deviated from
revolutionary Social-Democracy towards opportunism. This had become evident at
the Second Congress of the Party, from certain lines of argument, as well as
from the very membership of the Minority, composed as it was of the opponents
of the old Iskra and the elements least stable in point of
principle. After the Second Congress this shift of the Mensheviks
towards Rabocheye Dyelo opportunism became so obvious that
they themselves admitted
the existence of a gulf between the old Iskra and the new
Iskra. Indeed, on several questions the new Iskra has put
forward slogans and theories which are definitely false and which obscure the
class-consciousness of the proletariat. One such is the organisation-as-process
theory, which reduces Marxism to an apologia for disorganisation and
intellectualist anarchism. Another is the reversion to the false ideas
concerning
the relation of Party to class, which lower the tasks of the Party as vanguard,
leader, and organiser of the class. Equally erroneous and reactionary were the
points advanced by the new Iskra, in disagreement with the old
Iskra, on such questions as the attitude towards the liberals and the
plans for a Zemstvo campaign, on the preparation of the uprising and the alleged
utopianism of the ideas of timing and carrying through the uprising, on the
arming of the masses and their technical and organisational leadership in time
of revolution, on the impossibility and undesirability of the
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the petty
bourgeoisie in the period of the over throw of the autocracy, etc. The views
expressed on these questions tend to set the Party back, not only in the field
of theory, but in actual practice, and they are particularly harmful and
disastrous to the Party of the revolutionary proletariat in the present
revolutionary situation prevailing in

    

Russia. The Congress therefore instructs all Party members to explain the
      falseness of these views in their agitation and propaganda.

4
Resolution on the Relations Between Workers and
Intellectuals in the Social-Democratic Party

The Congress strongly condemns the policy pursued by the new-Iskrists of sowing
distrust and animosity between workers and intellectuals within the
Social-Democratic organisations. The Congress reminds all
class-conscious workers that a few years ago similar methods of
struggle were used by the
Rabocheye Dyelo wing of the Party and that at that time they repudiated
such methods. The empty phrases thrown about by the new—Iskrists
concerning the independent activity of the workers and the elective principle
are not accompanied by any real improvement in the work of our organisations and
they demagogically promise the unattainable. Under conditions of political
freedom, our Party can and will be built entirely on the elective
principle. Under the autocracy this is impracticable for the collective thousands of workers that make up the Party.


The Congress once more calls attention to the task of the consistent adherents
of the Social-Democratic Labour Party, namely, to strengthen with all their
might the ties between this Party and the masses of the working class, by
raising ever broader masses of proletarians and semi-proletarians to full
Social-Democratic consciousness, by stimulating their revolutionary and
Social-Democratic initiative, and by taking care that the working-class masses
advance from their own midst the maximum number of workers fully capable of
leading the movement and all the Party organisations.


The Congress, on behalf of the Party, repeats the advice of the revolutionary
Social-Democrats: to form as many workersâ organisations belonging to our Party
as possible; to strive to bring those workersâ organisations that do not wish to
enter the Party, or have no opportunity for so doing, at least into association
with the Party; and to make efforts to get the greatest possible number of
class-conscious Social-Democratic workers on the Party committees.

A good many of the comrades working in Russia, including the Bureau of
Committees of the Majority, are going on record for a single centre
in Russia.


What would such a reform actually mean? The idea unmistakably implied in this
tendency is that comrades active in Russia should predominate in the one
centre. Its realisation depends entirely upon the will of the Congress, which
will elect the members of the centre. Consequently, there is nothing to discuss
or to talk about on this point.


But, to go further, what will be the relation of the Central Organ to the
Central Committee? The Central Organ, we are told, is to be a commission
appointed by the C.C. One (or two) members of the Editorial Board of the Central
Organ may (say these comrades) sit on the C.C. as part of it, a minor
part. There arises the question in what way this foreign section of the
C.C. will participate in its work. The idea that real participation in
the work of the C.C. can be achieved âby correspondenceâ is
obviously utopian and could not be suggested seriously. It is only with great
difficulty, at the cost of tremendous effort, trouble, quarrelling, and
vexation, that those working abroad can obtain the scantiest information
post factum, so that one can only speak of âtaking part in
deciding thingsâ from abroad through sheer hypocrisy or in order to
âsound importantâ.


And so, the choice must be made: either the C.C. members (or, correspondingly,
member) residing abroad secure provision in the Party Rules (other
âagreementsâ being invalid) for the entire C.C. to meet
abroad periodically, in which case this supreme centre will, in
actual fact, be identical

    

with the present Party Council, i.e., it will become a body that meets three,
      four, or five times a year and gives only general direction to
    the work; or else for the C. C. to meet in Russia and settle all
    business there, without its component from abroad. In this case the
    latter is but nominally listed, avowedly fictitiously, as a member
    of the C.C. Actually, he can have no say in deciding
    general questions. Under such circumstances it is open to doubt whether any
    people will be found to fill this âpostâ (or shall we say
    sinecure?) of âmembers from abroadâ on the C.C.!


Another (and the last possible) assumption: the C.C. to consist
entirely of comrades who work in Russia and to constitute a single
centre. Only such a central body will really be a single Russian
centre. For work abroad it establishes an agency. In actual practice,
however, this agency will exist as an independent centre. To take the case of
the editors of the Central Organ. Clearly we shall need a full Board
here, that will only by a long drawn-out process take shape, form a
team, and pull together. (It took the people in Russia eighteen months
of hard effort to build up a new Central Organ after the Second
Congress, and that notwithstanding the in tense concern shown throughout Russia
for solving the grave general Party crisis.) In practice this Board
will issue the weekly organ independently. At best the C.C. in
Russia will show its interest in the way the publication is managed by calling a
âconferenceâ once in six months (or once in eighteen
months)—in what way will such a âconferenceâ differ from the
âCouncilâ?—or by a âletterâ from an individual
member of the C.C. In practice this foreign Board will conduct agitation and
train functionaries abroad (lectures, meetings) among hundreds of Party
members. The C.C. will be physically unable actually to
direct this work, actually to manage this work of the foreign Board. It
will be physically unable to participate in this work, except through
rare conferences with the persons conducting it. Here again—in
what way will these conferences differ from the Council?


To sum up: in actual fact, in practice, a âsingleâ Centre will
either be a myth, or it will merely boil down, positively and
inevitably, to the present system of what is scornfully called âthe Triple
Centreâ. In actual fact, in practice, differences in geographic and
political conditions, as well as

    

differences in the character of the work, inevitably and unavoidably
necessitate, and will continue to necessitate (until the fall of the autocracy),
two centres in our Party, united only from time to time by

âc o n f e r e n c e sâ,

which actually will always
play the role of supreme or highest âCouncilâ of the Party.


It is quite understandable that the reaction against the people abroad should
have evoked from those in Russia the general outcry: Down with the people
abroad! Down with two centres! This reaction is legitimate and
laudable; for it indicates the tremendous growth of the Partyâs
strength and of Party consciousness since the Second Congress. This reaction is
undeniably a step forward by our Party. But we must not be misled by the
fascination of words; we must not elevate to a âsystemâ the
mood of the moment, the passing âresentmentâ against the
âfellows abroadâ. No Party system can be built on anger. Nothing is
easier than to lay down the short and simple rule of âone
centreâ. But such a decision would bring us no nearer to the solution of
the intricate problem of finding methods for uniting actually (not merely on
paper) the diverse functions of the work in Russia and abroad.

In view of the convocation of the Third Congress of the Party some comrades,
practical workers, have asked us to publish the following statement. It would be
most desirable at the forthcoming debate on the organisational question at the
Congress if the counsels and opinions of the greatest possible number of
comrades who have been working in Russia were most carefully considered and
discussed. Therefore, let every such person express his opinion and
submit his answers to the following questions. The Editorial Board of
Vperyod will collect them and refer them to the Congress, so that every
delegate will be able to benefit from the collective experience of the mass of
his comrades. The main questions requiring to be clarified with a view to the
redrafting of the Rules and the formulation of the resolutions of the Congress
are approximately as follows: (1) Place, time and duration of work? (2) Worked
as member of a committee, or committee body, if so, of which? Of factory
circle, etc.? (3) What was the membership of each of the committees or
committee branches, organising groups, etc., as far as you know it? How many
workers and how many intellectuals were there in each? (4) What was the normal
practice of co-optation to the committee from the periphery? Could you give the
average duration of work in the periphery? Are there any instances of
dissatisfaction arising from co-optation, etc.? In your answers a clear line
should be drawn between the periods before and after the Second
Congress. Detailed information on the period before the
Second Congress is particularly desirable. (5) How many Party
organisations,

    

groups, circles, etc., were there altogether in the area where
you worked? List each group, the number of members, functions, etc. (6) Were
there any groups (organisations, circles, etc.) that were not considered Party
groups, but were close to the Party? (7) How did the periphery (and the various
kinds of periphery circles) and the committee maintain contact? Did these forms
of contact satisfy the members? (8) Do you consider it possible and desirable
to intro duce the elective principle? If not, why not? If you do, then in what
manner? Please state explicitly to what groups the right of election ought to be
applied. (9) Do you consider the separation of the committees (groups, circles,
organisations, etc.) into committees of intellectuals and committees of workers
to be advisable? If not, why not? If you do, please indicate what form of
separation is desirable. (10) Did the committee elect a central, directing
group? If it did, how? How often was it controlled? Were you satisfied with its
inauguration? (11) Do you consider it useful and possible for the local
organisations to have written Rules? (12) Do you consider it useful to include
any regulations concerning the local organisations (committees and others) in
the Party Rules? If you do, please mention what regulations. (13) Do you
consider it desirable for the Party Rules to define the exact rights of the
Central Committee in the matter of including (and excluding) members from the
committees and other organisations? What should be the precise rights of the
Central Committee? (114) Is it desirable to protect the autonomy of the local
committees by introducing special regulations, and if so, what regulations? (15)
How often did the committee, or the group, circle, etc., of which you were a
member meet? If possible, list all the meetings held during the period of your
work. If not, give a rough estimate. Were there any inconveniences in the
holding of frequent meetings? What, in your experience, is the average number of
possible and necessary meetings per month and how large should the number of
participants be?

There can be too much of a good thing, or so Mr. Lopukhin seems to say in his
memorandum. A good thing from the point of view of the police is the
“temporary” Security Regulations, which, since 1881, have been one
of the most stable fundamental laws of the Russian Empire. The police are given
all kinds of rights and powers to “keep the populace in hand”,
according to the apt expression of the memorandum, which is all the more
striking the more often one stumbles over the incredibly ponderous and clumsy
official turns of speech in which the memorandum is written. Yes, the police
have lived in clover under these “Regulations”, but their
“good” features have spoiled them. That is one aspect of the
matter. Another is the fact that the emergency measures of suppression, which
may have seemed extraordinary twenty-five years ago, have since become so
ordinary that the population has adjusted itself to them, so to speak. The
repressive significance of these emergency measures has weakened, just as a new
spring weakens from long and excessive use. The game is not worth the candle,
Mr. Lopukhin, Superintendent of the Police Department, implies in his
memorandum, which is written in a curiously melancholy and dismal tone.


How gratifying to a Social-Democrat is this dismal tone, this dry,
business-like, yet nonetheless devastating criticism by a police official of
Russia’s fundamental police law. Gone are the palmy days of policedom! Gone are
the sixties, when the very existence of a revolutionary party was unthought
of. Gone are the seventies, when the strength of such a party,

    

whose existence was an undoubted and terrifying fact, was “only equal to
individual acts of violence, but not to a political revolution”. In those
days, when “underground agitation found support only among individual
persons or circles”, the newly invented spring could still produce some
effect. But how slack this spring has now become, “in the present state of
society, when dissatisfaction with the existing order of things and a strong
opposition movement are be coming so widespread in Russia”! How absurd and
meaning less these emergency security measures proved to be when they had to be,
actually had to he, applied in thousands of cases “against
workers for engaging in strikes of a peaceful nature and purely economic in
motive”, when even cobble stones had to be classed as dangerous political
weapons!


In his despair, poor Lopukhin resorts to a double exclamation mark, which
invites Messieurs the Ministers to join him in laughing at the absurd
consequences to which the Security Regulations have led. Everything in these
Regulations has proved useless ever since the revolutionary movement really
penetrated among the people and became inseparably bound up with the class
movement of the working masses—everything, from the rules requiring the
registration of passports to the military tribunals. Even the “institution of house janitors”, that blessed godsend to the police, is
scathingly criticised by the Polizei-Minister, who accuses it of having
an enervating effect on the preventive activities of the police.


In truth, the complete bankruptcy of the police regime! This bankruptcy is
confirmed, apart from the assertions of such a highly competent person as the
most honourable Mr. Lopukhin, by the entire course of development of the tsarist
policy. When there was no really popular revolutionary movement, when the
political struggle was not yet connected and integrated with the class
struggle, simple police measures against individuals and study circles had their
use. Against classes these measures proved ludicrously in effective; by their
very profusion they became a hindrance to the work of the police. The once
awesome clauses of the Security Regulations have proved to be just miserable,
petty, quibbling chicaneries, which tend to stir up discontent among the
“plain people” ’who do not belong to the revolutionariea

    

rather than seriously to affect the revolutionaries them selves. Against the
      people’s revolution, against the class struggle the police cannot be
      depended on; one must have the backing of the people, too, the support of
      classes. Such is the moral of Mr. Lopukhin’s memorandum. And such is the
      moral which the autocratic government is drawing from practical
      experience. The springs of the police machinery have lost their snap;
      military force alone is now insufficient. One must stir up national
      hatred, race hatred; one must recruit “Black
      Hundreds”[1]

from among
      the politically least developed sections of the urban (and, following
      that, naturally, of the rural) petty bourgeoisie; one must attempt
    to rally to the defence of the throne all reactionary elements among the
    population at large; one must turn the struggle of the police against study
    circles into a struggle of one part of the people against the other.


That is precisely what the government is now doing when it sets the Tatars
against the Armenians in Baku; when it seeks to provoke new pogroms against the
Jews; when it organises Black-Hundred gangs against the Zemstvo people,
students, and rebellious Gymnasium youths; and when it appeals to the loyal
nobles and to the conservative elements among the peasants. Ah, well! We
Social-Democrats are not surprised at these tactics of the autocracy; nor shall
we be frightened by them. We know that it will no longer help the government to
stir up racial animosity since the workers have begun to organise armed
resistance to the pogrom-bandits; and by relying on the exploiting sections of
the petty bourgeoisie the government will only antagonise still broader masses
of real proletarians. We have never expected any political or social
revolutions to come from “convincing” the powers that be, or
from educated persons turning to the paths of “virtue”. We have
always taught that it is the class struggle, the struggle of the exploited part
of the people against the exploiters, that lies at the bottom of political
transformations and in the final analysis determines the fate of all
such transformations. By admitting the complete failure of the pettifogging
police methods and passing over to the direct organisation of civil war, the
government shows that the final reckoning is approaching. So much the
better. It is launching the civil war. So much the better. We, too, are

    

for the civil war. If there is any sphere in which we feel particularly
confident, it is here, in the war of the vast masses of the oppressed and the
downtrodden, of the toiling millions who keep the whole of society going,
against a handful of privileged parasites. Of course, by fanning racial
antagonism and tribal hatred, the government may for a time arrest the
development of the class struggle, but only for a short time and at the cost of
a still greater expansion of the field of the new struggle, at the cost of a
more bitter feeling among the people against the autocracy. This is proved by
the consequences of the Baku pogrom, which deepened tenfold the revolutionary
mood of all sections against tsarism. The government thought to frighten the
people by the sight of bloodshed and the vast toll of street battles; but
actually it is dispelling the people’s fear of bloodshed, of a direct
armed encounter. Actually, the government is furthering our cause, with
agitation of a scope wider and more impressive than we could ever have dreamed
of. Vive le son du canon! say we in the words of the French
revolutionary song: “Hail the thunder of the cannon!” Hail the revolution!
Hail the open war of the people against the tsarist government and its
adherents!

The development of a mass working-class movement in Russia in connection with
the development of Social-Democracy is marked by three notable transitions. The
first was the transition from narrow propagandist circles to wide economic
agitation among the masses; the second was the transition to political agitation
on a large scale and to open street demonstrations; the third was the
transition. to actual civil war, to direct revolutionary struggle, to the armed
popular uprising. Each of these transitions was prepared, on the one hand, by
socialist thought working mainly in one direction, and on the other, by the
profound changes that had taken place in the conditions of life and in the whole
mentality of the working class, as well as by the fact that increasingly wider
strata of the working class were roused to more conscious and active
struggle. Sometimes these changes took place imperceptibly, the proletariat
rallying its forces behind the scenes in an unsensational way, so that the
intellectuals often doubted the lasting quality and the vital power of the mass
movement. There would then be a turning-point, and the whole revolutionary
movement would, suddenly, as it were, rise to a new and higher stage. The
proletariat and its vanguard, Social-Democracy, would be confronted with new
practical tasks, to deal with which, new forces would spring up,
seemingly out of the ground, forces whose existence no one had suspected shortly
before the turning-point. But all this did not take place at once, without
vacillations, with out a struggle of currents within the Social-Democratic
movement, without relapses to outworn views long since thought dead and buried.

 

Social-Democracy in Russia is once again passing through such a period of
      vacillation. There was a time when political agitation had to break its
      way through opportunist theories, when it was feared that we would not be
      equal to the new tasks, when excessive repetition of the adjective
      “class”, or a tail-ender’s interpretation of the Party’s
      attitude to the class, was used to justify the fact that the Social-Democrats lagged behind the demands of the proletariat. The course of the
      movement has swept aside all these short-sighted fears and backward
      views. The new upsurge now is attended once more, although in a somewhat
      different form, by a struggle against obsolete circles and tendencies. The
    Rabocheye Dyelo-ists have come to life again in the
    new-Iskrists. To adapt our tactics and our organisation to the new tasks, we
    have to overcome the resistance of opportunist theories of “a higher
    type of demonstration” (the plan of the Zemstvo campaign), or of the
    “organisation-as-process”; we have to combat the reactionary
    fear of “timing” the uprising, or the fear of the
    revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the
    peasantry. Once again, excessive (and very often foolish) repetition of the
    word “class” and belittlement of the Party’s tasks in regard to
    the class are used to justify the fact that Social-Democracy is lagging
    behind the urgent needs of the proletariat. The slogan “workers’
    independent activity” is again being misused by people who worship the
    lower forms of activity and ignore the higher forms of really
    Social-Democratic independent activity, the really revolutionary initiative
    of the proletariat itself.


There is not the slightest doubt that the movement, in its course, will once
again sweep aside these survivals of obsolete and lifeless views. Such sweeping
aside, however, should not be reduced to mere rejection of the old errors, but,
what is incomparably more important, it should take the form of constructive
revolutionary work towards fulfilling the new tasks, towards attracting into our
Party and utilising the new forces that are now coming into the revolutionary
field in such vast masses. It is these questions of constructive revolutionary
work that should be the main subject in the deliberations of the forthcoming
Third Congress; upon these questions all our Party members should concentrate
in their local and general work. As to the new

    

tasks that confront us, of this we have spoken in general terms on more than one
occasion. They are: to extend our agitation to new strata of the urban and rural
poor; to build up a broader, more flexible, and stronger organisation; to
prepare the uprising and to arm the people; and, to these ends, to conclude
agreements with the revolutionary democrats. That new forces have arisen for
the fulfilment of these tasks is eloquently borne out by the reports of general
strikes all over Russia, of the strikes and the revolutionary mood among the
youth, among the democratic intelligentsia generally, and even among many
sections of the bourgeoisie. The existence of these tremendous fresh forces and
the positive assurance that only a small portion of the whole vast stock of
inflammable material among the working class and the peasantry has so far been
affected by the present unprecedented revolutionary ferment in Russia are a
reliable pledge that the new tasks can and will be unfailingly fulfilled. The
practical question confronting us now is, first, how to utilise,
direct, unite, and organise these new forces; how to focus
Social-Democratic work on the new, higher tasks of the day without for a moment
forgetting the old, ordinary run of tasks that confront us, and will continue to
confront us, so long as the world of capitalist exploitation continues to exist.


To indicate several methods for dealing with this practical question we shall
begin with an individual, but to our mind very characteristic, instance. A
short time ago, on the very eve of the outbreak of the revolution, the liberal-bourgeois Osvobozhdeniye (No. 63) touched on the question of the
organisational work of the Social-Democrats. Closely following the struggle
between the two trends in Social-Democracy, Osvobozhdeniye lost no
opportunity again and again to take advantage of the new Iskra’s
reversion to Economism, in order to emphasise (in connection with the demagogic
pamphlet by “A Worker”) its own profound sympathy with the principles of
Economism. This liberal publication correctly pointed out that the pamphlet (see
Vperyod, No. 2, on the

       subject[1]

)

implies inevitable negation, or
belittlement, of the role of revolutionary Social-Democracy. Referring to

    

“A Worker’s” absolutely incorrect assertions that since the victory
      of the orthodox Marxists the economic struggle has been ignored,
    Osvobozhdeniye says:


“The illusion of present-day Russian Social-Democracy lies in its fear of
educational work, of legal ways, of Economism, of so-called non-political forms
of the labour movement, and in its failure to understand that only educational
work, legal and non-political forms, can create a sufficiently strong and broad
foundation for a working-class movement that will really be worthy of the name
revolutionary.” Osvobozhdeniye urges its adherents “to take upon
themselves the initiative in building a trade union movement”, not in
opposition to Social-Democracy, but hand in hand with it; and it draws a
parallel between this situation and that which prevailed in the German labour
movement during the operation of the Exceptional Law Against the
Socialists.[5]


This is not the place to deal with this analogy, a totally erroneous one. In the
first place, it is necessary to reassert the truth about the attitude of the
Social-Democrats towards the legal forms of the working-class
movement. “The legalisation of non-socialist and non-political labour
unions in Russia has begun,” we wrote in 1902 in What Is To Be

      Done?[2]

“Henceforth, we cannot but reckon with this tendency.” How shall we
reckon with it?—the question is raised there and answered by a reference
to the need of exposing, not only the Zubatov theories, but also all liberal
harmony speeches about “class collaboration”. (In inviting the
collaboration of the Social-Democrats, Osvobozhdeniye fully
acknowledges the first task, but ignores the second.) “Doing
this,” the
pamphlet goes on to say, “does not at all mean forgetting that in the long
run the legalisation of the working-class movement will be to our advantage,
and not to that of the Zubatovs.” In exposing Zubatovism and liberalism at
legal meetings we are separating the tares from the wheat. “By the wheat
we mean attracting the attention of ever larger numbers, including the most
backward sections, of the workers to social and political questions, and freeing
ourselves, the revolutionaries, from functions that are essentially legal (the
distribution of legal books, mutual aid,

    

etc.), the development of which will inevitably provide us with an increasing
quantity of material for agitation.”


It follows clearly from this that if anyone is suffering from an
“illusion” with regard to the question of
“fearing” the legal forms of the movement, it is
Osvobozhdeniye. Far from fearing these forms, the revolutionary
Social-Democrats clearly point to the existence within them of tares as
well as wheat. Osvobozhdeniye’s arguments, consequently, only cover up
the liberals’ real (and founded) fear that revolutionary
Social-Democracy will expose the class essence of liberalism.


But what interests us most, from the point of view of present-day tasks, is the
question of relieving the revolutionaries of some of their functions. The very
fact that we are now experiencing the beginning of the revolution makes this a
particularly topical and widely significant question. “The more
energetically we carry on our revolutionary struggle, the more the government
will be compelled to legalise part of the trade union work, thereby relieving
us of part of our burden,” we said in What Is To Be

      Done?[3]

But the
energetic revolutionary struggle relieves us of “part of our burden”
in many other ways besides this. The present situation has done more than merely
“legalise” much of what was formerly banned. It has widened the
movement to such an extent that, regardless of government legalisation, many
things that were considered and actually were within reach only of
revolutionaries have now entered the sphere of practice, have become customary
and accessible to the masses. The whole course of Social-Democracy’s historical
development is characterised by the fact that in face of all obstacles it has
been winning for itself increased freedom of action, despite tsarist laws and
police measures. The revolutionary proletariat surrounds itself, as it were,
with a certain atmosphere, unthinkable for the government, of sympathy and sup
port both within the working class and within other classes (which, of course,
agree with only a small part of the demands of the working-class democrats). In
the initial stages of the movement a Social-Democrat had to carry on a great
deal of what almost amounted to cultural work, or to concentrate

    

almost exclusively on economic agitation. Now these functions, one after
      another, are passing into the hands of new forces, of wider sections that
      are being enlisted in the movement. The revolutionary organisations have
      concentrated more and more on carrying out the function of real
    political leadership, the function of’ drawing
    Social-Democratic conclusions from the workers’ protest and the
    popular discontent. In the beginning we had to teach the workers the ABC,
    both in the literal and in the figurative senses. Now the standard of
    political literacy has risen so gigantically that we can and should
    concentrate all our efforts on the more direct Social-Democratic objectives
    aimed at giving an organised direction to the revolutionary stream. Now the
    liberals and the legal press are doing a great deal of the
    “preparatory” work upon which we have hitherto had to expend so
    much effort. Now the open propaganda of democratic ideas and demands, no
    longer persecuted by the weakened government; has spread so widely that we
    must learn to adjust ourselves to this entirely new scope of the
    movement. Naturally, in this preparatory work there are both tares and
    wheat. Naturally, Social-Democrats will now have to pay greater attention to
    combating the influence of the bourgeois democrats on the workers. But this
    very work will have much more real Social-Democratic content than our
    former activity, which aimed mainly at rousing the politically unconscious
    masses.


The more the popular movement spreads, the more clearly will the true nature of
the different classes stand revealed and the more pressing will the
Party’s task be in leading the class, in becoming its organiser,
instead of dragging at the tail-end of events. The more the revolutionary
independent activity of all kinds develops everywhere, the more obvious will
be the hollowness and inanity of the Rabocheye Dyelo catchwords, so
eagerly taken up by the new-Iskrists, about independent activity in general, the
more significant will become the meaning of Social-Democratic
independent activity, and the greater will be the demands which events make on
our revolutionary initiative. The wider the new streams of the social
movement become, the greater becomes the importance of a strong
Social-Democratic organisation capable of creating new channels for these
streams. The

    

more the democratic propaganda and agitation conducted in dependently of us
works to our advantage, the greater

be comes 

the importance of an organised
Social-Democratic leadership to safeguard the independence of the working class
from the bourgeois democrats.


A revolutionary epoch is to the Social-Democrats what war-time is to an army. We
must broaden the cadres of our army, we must advance them from peace strength to
war strength, we must mobilise the reservists, recall the furloughed, and form
new auxiliary corps, units, and services. We must not forget that in war we
necessarily and inevitably have to put up with less trained replacements, very
often to replace officers with rank-and-file soldiers, and to speed up and
simplify the promotion of soldiers to officers’ rank.


To drop metaphor, we must considerably increase the membership of all Party and
Party-connected organisations in order to be able to keep up to some extent with
the stream of popular revolutionary energy which has been a hundred fold
strengthened. This, it goes without saying, does not mean that consistent
training and systematic instruction in the Marxist truths are to be left in the
shade. We must,

how ever, 

remember that at the present time far greater significance in the
matter of training and education attaches to the military
operations, which teach the untrained precisely and entirely in
our sense. We must remember that our “doctrinaire”
faithfulness to Marxism is now being reinforced by the march of revolutionary
events, which is everywhere furnishing object lessons to the masses and
that all these lessons confirm precisely our dogma. Hence, we do not speak
about abandoning the dogma, or relaxing our distrustful and suspicious attitude
towards the woolly intellectuals and the

arid-minded 

revolutionaries. Quite the
contrary. We speak about new methods of teaching dogma, which it would be
unpardonable for a Social-Democrat to forget. We speak of the importance for our
day of using the object lessons of the great revolutionary events in order to
convey—not to study circles, as in the past, but to the masses—our
old, “dogmatic” lessons that, for example, it is necessary in
practice to combine terror with the uprising of the masses, or that behind the
liberalism of the educated Russian society one must be able to discern the
class interests of our

    

bourgeoisie (cf. our polemics with the Socialists-Revolutionaries on this
      question in Vperyod,

No. 3[4]

).



Thus, it is not a question of relaxing our Social-Democratic exactingness and
our orthodox intransigence, but of strengthening both in new ways, by
new methods of training. In war-time, recruits should get their training lessons
directly from military operations. So tackle the new methods of training more
boldly, comrades! Forward, and organise more and more squads, send them into
battle, recruit more young workers, extend the normal framework of all Party
organisations, from committees to factory groups, craft unions, and student
circles! Remember that every moment of delay in this task will play into the
hands of the enemies of Social-Democracy; for the new streams are seeking an
immediate outlet, and if they do not find a Social-Democratic channel they will
rush into a non-Social-Democratic channel. Remember that every practical step in
the revolutionary movement will decidedly, inevitably give the young recruits a
lesson in Social-Democratic science; for this science is based on an objectively
correct estimation of the forces and tendencies of the various classes, while
the revolution itself is nothing but the break-up of old superstructures and the
independent action of the various classes, each striving to erect the new
superstructure in its own way. But do not debase our revolutionary science to
the level of mere book dogma, do not vulgarise it with wretched phrases about
tactics-as-process and organisation-as-process, with phrases that seek to
justify confusion, vacillation, and lack of initiative. Give more scope to all
the diverse kinds of enterprise on the part of the most varied groups and
circles, bearing in mind that, apart from our counsel and regardless of it, the
relentless exigencies of the march of revolutionary events will keep them upon
the correct course. It is an old maxim that in politics one often has to learn
from the enemy. And at revolutionary moments the enemy always forces correct
conclusions upon us in a particularly instructive and speedy manner.


To sum up, we must reckon with the growing movement, which has increased a
hundredfold, with the new tempo of

    

the work, with the freer atmosphere and the wider field of activity. The work
must be given an entirely different scope. Methods of training should be
refocussed from peaceful instruction to military operations. Young fighters
should be recruited more boldly, widely, and rapidly into the ranks of all
and every kind of our organisations. Hundreds of new organisations
should be set up for the purpose without a moment’s delay. Yes, hundreds; this
is no hyperbole, and let no one tell me that it is “too late” now to
tackle such a broad organisational job. No, it is never too late to organise. We
must use the freedom we are getting by law and the freedom we are taking
despite the law to strengthen and multiply the number of Party organisations of
all varieties. Whatever the course or the outcome of the revolution may be,
however early it may be checked by one or other circumstance, all its
real gains will be rendered secure and reliable only insofar as the proletariat
is organised.


The slogan “Organise!" which the adherents of the majority wanted to
issue, fully formulated, at the Second Congress must now be put into effect
immediately. If we fail to show bold initiative in setting up new organisations,
we shall have to give up as groundless all pretensions to the role of
vanguard. If we stop helplessly at the achieved boundaries, forms, and confines
of the committees, groups, meetings, and circles, we shall merely prove our own
incapacity. Thou sands of circles are now springing up everywhere without our
aid, without any definite programme or aim, simply under the impact of
events. The Social-Democrats must make it their task to establish and strengthen
direct contacts with the greatest possible number of these circles, to assist
them, to give them the benefit of their own knowledge and experience, to
stimulate them with their own revolutionary initiative. Let all such circles,
except those that are avowedly non-Social-Democratic, either directly join the
Party or align themselves with the Party. In the latter event we must
not demand that they accept our programme or that they necessarily enter into
organisational relations with us. Their mood of protest and their sympathy for
the cause of international revolutionary Social-Democracy in themselves suffice,
provided the Social-Democrats work effectively among them, for these circles of
sympathisers under the

    

impact of events to be transformed at first into democratic assistants and then
      into convinced members of the Social-Democratic working-class party.


There are masses of people, and we are short of people; this contradictory
formula has long expressed the contradictions between the organisational life
and the organisational needs of the Social-Democratic Party. Today
this contradiction is more salient than ever before; we often hear
from all sides
passionate appeals for new forces, complaints about the shortage of forces in
the organisations, while at the same time we have everywhere countless offers of
service, a growth of young forces, especially among the working class. The
practical organiser who complains of a shortage of people under such
circumstances becomes the victim of the illusion from which Madame Roland
suffered, when she wrote in 1793, at the peak of the Great French Revolution,
that France had no men, that there were only dwarfs. People who talk in this
manner do not see the wood for the trees; they admit that they are blinded by
events, that it is not they, the revolutionaries, who control events in mind
and deed, but events that control them and have overwhelmed them. Such
organisers had better retire and leave the field clear for younger
forces who often make up with verve what they lack in experience.


There is no dearth of people; never has revolutionary Russia had such a
multitude of people as now. Never has a revolutionary class been so well off
for temporary allies, conscious friends, and unconscious supporters as the
Russian proletariat is today. There are masses of people; all we need do is get
rid of tail-ist ideas and precepts, give full scope to initiative and
enterprise, to “plans” and “undertakings”, and thus show
ourselves to be worthy representatives of the great revolutionary class. Then
the proletariat of Russia will carry through the whole great Russian
revolution as heroically as it has begun it.

The Exceptional Law Against the Socialists was
promulgated in Germany in 1878. The law suppressed all organisations of the
Social-Democratic Party, mass working-class organisations, and the labour
press; socialist literature was confiscated; and the banishing of socialists
began. The law was annulled in 1890 under pressure of
 the mass working-class movement.

Osvobozhdeniye, No. 66, published a review of Martynov’s pamphlet
Two Dictatorships (approved and recommended by the editors of
Iskra; see issue No. 84). As was to be expected, the liberal bourgeois
does not conceal his sympathies with the opportunist wing of the
Social-Democratic movement. Osvobozhdeniye regards Martynov’s
pamphlet,
“like the work of Mr. Akimov”, as “one of the
most interesting contributions to Social-Democratic literature of the present
day”. Gould a liberal have reacted in any other way to the preaching
of tail-ism, which seeks to frighten the revolutionary class with the dire
perspective of participation in the provisional government and the
“revolutionary dictatorship” in a democratic revolution
(which Martynov, in his fear of “Jacobinism” confounds
with the socialist revolution!)? Is it merely a coincidence that
Osvobozhdeniye, in the article “A Significant Turn”,
welcomed Plekhanov’s ideas of making concessions to the revisionists? How is one
to account for Osvobozhdeniye’s assertion (No. 57) that in fact, the
Menshevists are now defending something more vital and essential than the
Bolshevists”? Is it not because “the only hope for the ideological
vitality of Russian liberalism lies in the vitality of Social-Democratic
opportunism” (see our publication An Obliging

     Liberal[1]

)?

Was Mr. Struve right or wrong in contending that Trotsky’s pamphlet
Our Political Tasks, published under the editorship of
“Iskra” (see issue No. 72) “is
perfectly right in defending certain

    

ideas with which readers of Social-Democratic literature have been familiar from
      the writings of Messrs. Akimov, Martynov, Krichevsky, and other so-called
      Economists” (Osvobozhdeniye, No. 57)? Had Martynov and
    Co. stopped to think of these questions, they might perhaps have been able
    to grasp the puzzling (how very, very puzzling!) ideas of the old
    Iskra about the similarity of the relations between the Jacobins
    and the Girondists, on the one hand, and between the revolutionary
    Social-Democrats and the opportunists, on the other. (This idea was first
    advanced, if we are not mistaken, in the leading article of Iskra,
    No. 2, written by Plekhanov.) Were the Girondists traitors to the cause of
    the Great French Revolution? They were not. But they were inconsistent,
    wavering, opportunist champions of that cause. That is why they
    were opposed by the Jacobins, who upheld the interests of the advanced class
    of the eighteenth century as consistently as the revolutionary Social-Democrats uphold the interests of the advanced class of the twentieth. That
    is why the downright betrayers of the cause of the great revolution, the
    monarchists, the clerical constitutionalists, etc., supported the Girondists
    and shielded them from the attacks of the Jacobins. Are you beginning to see
    light now, most honourable Girondist Martynov? Not yet? Well, we shall try
    to clarify the point further. Are the new-Iskrists traitors to the
    proletarian cause? No. But they are inconsistent, wavering, opportunist
    champions of the cause (and of the organisational and tactical principles
    illumining the cause). That is why their position is opposed by the
    revolutionary Social-Democrats (by some directly and overtly, by others
    covertly, behind the closed doors of their editorial offices, with devices
    and ruses). That is why the new-Iskrists are ideologically sup ported and
    shielded by the Osvobozhdeniye crowd—the down right
      betrayers of the proletarian cause. Are you beginning to see light
    now, most honourable Girondist Martynov?

Iskra and the so-called Council are continuing their tactics of delay,
of pretexts, and of evasion in the matter of convening the Congress. Plekhanov
tries to take a formal stand by reiterating with an insistence worthy of a
better cause that the Congress is convened by the Council and that therefore any
congress not so convened is illegal. This argument is so one-sided and naively
self-interested that one is strongly tempted “to give the hare a bit of
the

     bear’s ear”[1]

—to

give Plekhanov a medal for his meticulous observance
of the Party Rules and Party laws! We would most humbly ask the very honourable
advocate of the dialectic, that is, of the all-round approach: does the Council
exist for the Party or the Party for the Council? Is the Council accountable
to, and controllable by, the Party or is the Party accountable to the Council?
Does discipline for the higher body eliminate discipline for the lower body?
Will our vigilant limb of the law try to remember the arguments he used in this
connection at the Second Congress of the Party?


The Council, according to our Rules, is duty bound to convene a congress when
half the votes are cast for it. What is the Party to do when the Council shirks
its duties? The Rules of the German Social-Democratic Party give a direct answer
to this question, namely, the Congress in such an event is convened not by the
supreme governing body of the Party, but by a special control committee
independent of that body. Our Rules give no answer at all to that question

    

Does this mean, we ask our friends of the new Iskra, that the problem
    is insoluble? Does it mean that should the Council shirk its Party
    responsibilities the Party would have to dissolve and be superseded by the
    Council? The Party for the Council—is that it?


We make bold to say that this is not so, that the Party itself is
obliged to see to it that its Rules are observed by its functionaries,
that “to see to it” does not only mean to criticise by word but to
rectify by deed. He who is unable to demand successfully of his
agents the discharge of their duties towards those who entrusted them is
unworthy of the name of a politically free citizen. He who cannot demand
successfully of his agents the discharge of their Party duties towards
those who entrusted them is unworthy of the name of Party member. The Council is
the agent of the committees. The committees are in duty bound to demand
of this agent the discharge of its duties towards those who have entrusted
it. This the committees can do only by electing their bureau for
convening the Congress. And that is what the committees have done. That is what
they were obliged to do, if they were conscious of their elementary
Party obligations.


Will the honourable Comrade Plekhanov, perhaps, try to deny the correctness of
this statement? Will he try to name any Social-Democratic party in the
world whose members would have refrained from acting as our committees acted,
when faced with the refusal of a given Party body to convene the Party Congress?
We challenge you to try, Comrade Plekhanov.


Now let us proceed to the second factual question, whether our Council actually
did shirk its Party duties in the matter of convening the Congress. This is no
mere formal question, since apart from duty under the Rules there is still the

       duty...[2]

In issue No. 89 of Iskra, just arrived, we find a decision of the
“Party Council” dated March 8, 1905. As was to be expected, the
“Council” abroad frets and fumes against the Party Congress which is
being convened by the Party commit tees in Russia, declaring that “in
acting the way they do, its participants place themselves outside the
Party”. We quite understand the resentment of the group abroad, from whom
the Party working in Russia has long since moved away in actual fact and is now
moving away also formally. We also understand that only under the spur of
resentment and despair can people argue so illogically and “deviate from
the truth” as maladroitly as does the Council. “According to the
Party Rules,” we are told, “the Congress can be convened only by the
Council.” Yes, except in those cases when the Council breaks these Rules and,
instead of convening the Congress, as it is in duty bound to do, fraudulently
evades the issue. Precisely such a “case” was proved long ago by the
Party against the Council (see Orlovsky’s The Council Against the
Party, where he shows, among other things, that according to the
“Council’s” arithmetic,

16x4=61!). 

We are told
further that on January 1, 1905, according to the unanimous decision of the
Council (including Lenin’s vote) there were 33 qualified organisations besides
the centres. That is not true. The Party has long known, from that pamphlet,
that on January 1, 1905, the number of such organisations was only 29. The
Kuban and Kazan committees mentioned by Iskra were never approved by
the Council, while the Polesyc and North-Western committees were approved only
as of April 1, 1905. This leaves 29 organisations (the committees of
St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, the North,

    

Tula, Nizhni-Novgorod, Saratov, Ural-Ufa, Siberia, Don, Kharkov, Kiev, Odessa,
      Ekaterinoslav, Riga, Orel-Bryansk, Smolensk, Samara, Voronezh, the
      Caucasian Federation=4 committees, Kursk, Astrakhan, Nikolayev, Crimea,
      the Mining and Metal District, and the League). The “Bureau of
      Committees of the Majority” maintains that it has been authorised by
      ten organisations, the Council further states. That is a lie. The Bureau
      was elected, as everyone knows, before January 1, 1905, at three
      conferences, by 13 committees (6 Northern, 3 Southern, and 4
    Caucasian). After the Bureau announced the convening of the Congress, the
    Voronezh and Tula committees aligned themselves with it. So that up to
    January 1, 1905, out of the 28 qualified organisations in Russia, 15
    declared for the Congress, in defiance of the Bonapartist centres. This
    does not include the qualified organisations (the Saratov, Siberian, and
    other committees) which long ago declared themselves generally in favour of
    the Congress (see Shakhov’s pamphlet The Struggle for the
      Congress). How ludicrous and clumsy are the Council’s attempts to
    deceive the uninformed public, which learns of what is happening, not from
    documents, but from gossip abroad, is strikingly illustrated in the
    following two reports. In the very interesting pamphlet Report of the
      Geneva Meeting on September 2, 1904, issued by the Minority, Dan admits that the majority of the Party committees broke off all comradely
    relations with Iskra, while Plekhanov, a bitter opponent of the
    Majority, was compelled to declare that the forces of the warring camps were
    approximately equal! (This is the opinion of a resident abroad, mark you.)
    In Lenin’s

  Statement[1]

–which,

far from being refuted by the Minority, was openly acknowledged by
    Popov—no less a person than an
    agent of the Central Committee admits that the Minority has only four
    committees in Russia, and that at a real Party congress the Editorial Board
    and the Council are certain to be removed from office. Once more: whom are
    you trying to fool, you heroes of co-optation? You are mortally afraid of
    the only real Party solution—the Congress—while at the same time
    you claim that your opponents are backed by a negligible fraction of the
    total number of organisations,

    

only about a quarter at the most! In your fury you fail to see that
you are castigating no one but yourselves. Is Nicholas II, then,
afraid of a Constituent Assembly because the enemies of tsarism
constitute only a negligible fraction of the people?

We have pointed out the unpardonable short-sightedness of the new-Iskrists’ view
that moderate Russian liberalism has been dealt its

      death-blow[1]

and that the
vanguard role of the proletariat has been recognised by our democrats. On the
contrary, the bourgeois democrats are striving more than ever now to gain
control of the working-class movement; more harmful now than ever, therefore, is
Rabocheye Dyelo-ism, which the new-Iskrists are attempting to
revive. Here is an interesting leaflet which is being circulated in Russia and
which offers valuable material on this question:


“The bourgeoisie has lately shown a tendency towards organisation; but what
is still more significant is that the bourgeois democrats are turning to the
workers. The democrats want to act as leaders of the proletariat’s economic and
political struggle. ’By conviction,’ they say, ’we are, strictly speaking,
Social-Democrats; but Social-Democracy, owing to Party dissensions, does not
grasp the importance of the present moment and has failed to lead the
working-class movement; this is where we want to step in.’ We learn
from what they have
to say further that these new ’Social Democrats at heart’ have not worked out
any programme of their own but merely intend to explain things to the workers
and answer their inquiries. The literature is to meet the same needs and is by
no means to bear a Party character. And so these ’clean Social-Democrats’,
dissatisfied with the tactics and the present behaviour of the Committee, have
turned to the methods of ’lending ear to the masses’, which history

    

has long ago rejected, to the methods of Economism of blessed
memory. Considering themselves to be Social-Democrats and the true spokesmen of
working-class aspirations, these gentlemen do not understand or do not want to
understand that the working-class movement will achieve substantial results only
if it is led by a united working-class party, if the proletariat is conscious of
its class distinctness and realises that its real emancipation lies in its own
hands and not in the hands of the bourgeois democrats, who are discrediting the
actions of the workers’ party. These ’strictly-speaking’ Social-Democrats,
alleged Marxists, ought to realise the demoralisation they are bringing among
the working-class masses by seeking to prove that certain ’democrats’ (but not
Social-Democrats) consisting exclusively of bourgeois intellectuals are called
upon to show the workers the way to freedom and socialism.


“The last point, though, they seem to have entirely forgotten in their
absorption with politics of the day. Little by little they are carrying elements
of opportunism into the working-class movement. The workers are not so keen now
on founding a party of their own, relying as they do on the
intelligentsia. Why, then, do these new friends of the working class
allow and
even encourage such things to happen? The ’democrats’ themselves give a frank
reply to this question. ’Our group used to work only among the intellectuals,’
they say, ’but recent events have compelled us to turn to the workers.’


“The democratic milk-skimmers, who call themselves Social-Democrats in
’principle’, began to give their gracious attention to the proletarian movement
only after the masses had come out into the streets and the blood of

thou sands 

of workers had stained the pavements. Posing as the true friends of the working
class, they pass by with a hypocritical mien the work of decades, work which
has created and directed the revolutionary mood of the Russian proletariat and,
at the cost of great sacrifices, brought into being the united Social-Democratic
working-class party. Apparently, these modernistic Social-Democrats have
learned only one thing from the whole of Marxist doctrine (and that only
recently), namely, that only the power of the organised proletariat is capable
of overthrowing autocratic tyranny and

    

winning political freedom, the benefit of which will be derived mainly by the
bourgeoisie. The new friends of the proletariat are trying to saddle
      themselves upon the working-class movement and urge it on with the whip
      of immediate results, to the shout, ’Onward, to our freedom!’ How apt the
      Russian proverb, God save us from our friends, from our enemies we shall
      save ourselves.”

The peasant uprisings have begun. Reports of peasants raiding landed estates and
confiscating the landlords’ grain and cattle are coming in from various
provinces. The tsarist armies, routed by the Japanese in Manchuria, are taking
their revenge on the defenceless people, making expeditions against the enemy at
home, against the rural poor. The urban working-class movement is acquiring a
new ally in the revolutionary peasantry. The attitude of the class-conscious
vanguard of the proletariat, the Social-Democrats, towards the peasant movement
is becoming a question of immediate practical significance and must be placed
on the order of the day in all our Party organisations, in all
speeches by propagandists and agitators.


The Social-Democrats have pointed out repeatedly that the peasant movement sets
before them a twofold task. Unquestionably we must support this movement and
spur it on, inasmuch as it is a revolutionary-democratic movement. At the same
time we must unswervingly maintain our class proletarian point of view; we must
organise the rural proletariat, like the urban proletariat and together with
it, into an independent class party; we must explain to it

that. its 

interests
are antagonistic to those of the bourgeois peasantry; we must call upon it to
fight for the socialist revolution, and point out to it that liberation from
oppression and poverty lies, not in turning several sections of the peasantry
into petty bourgeois, but only in replacing the entire bourgeois system by the
socialist system.


This twofold task of the Social-Democrats was often stressed in the old
Iskra, beginning with issue

No. 3,[1]

i. e., even

    

before the first peasant movement of 1902; it found expression in our Party
      programme; it was also repeated in our newspaper (issue

No. 3[2]

).

Now, when
      it is particularly important to throw light on the practical aspects of
      this problem, it would be of interest to quote the remarks of Karl
      Kautsky, who published an article entitled “The Peasants and the
      Revolution in Russia” in the German Social-Democratic journal,
    Die Neue Zeit. As a Social-Democrat, Kautsky stoutly upholds the
    truth that the task facing our revolution now is not that of effecting the
    socialist revolution but that of removing the political obstacles to the
    development of the existing, capitalist, mode of production. He goes on to
    say: “On the question of the relations between peasant and landlord,
    the revolutionary urban movement should remain neutral. It has no reason to
    step in between the peasants and the landlord, to champion the latter
    against the former; its sympathies are wholly with the peasantry. But
    neither is it the task of the revolutionary urban movement to incite the
    peasants against the landlords, who in present-day Russia play an entirely
    different role from that, let us say, of the French feudal nobility in the
    days of the ancien régime. Besides, even if they wished to, the
    urban revolutionaries could have very little influence on the relations
    between the landlords and the peasants. That is a matter the landlords and
    the peasants must settle between them selves." For a correct understanding
    of Kautsky’s remarks, which, taken out of context, might create no little
    misunderstanding, one must bear in mind also the following remark at the
    end of the article: “A victorious revolution would not have too much
    difficulty in using the large latifundia of the worst enemies of the
    revolution ... to improve the conditions of the proletarians and the
    peasants.”


The reader who carefully compares these statements of Kautsky will easily
recognise in them the Social-Democratic presentation of the question we have
just outlined. Certain inaccuracies and unclarities in Kautsky’s expressions can
be accounted for by the cursory nature of his remarks and his insufficient
acquaintance with the agrarian programme of Russian Social-Democracy. The crux
of the matter is that

    

the attitude of the revolutionary proletariat towards the antagonism between the
peasants and the landlords cannot, in all the exigencies of the Russian
revolution, remain the same in all cases and under all circumstances. Under
certain circumstances, in certain situations, this attitude must be one not only
of sympathy, but of direct support, and not merely support, but actual
“incitement”. Under other circumstances, the attitude can and
should be neutral. Judging from what we have quoted, Kautsky has correctly
grasped this double aspect of our task, in contrast, not only to our
“Social ists-Revolutionaries”, who are sunk completely in
the vulgar illusions of revolutionary democracy, but also to many
Social-Democrats,
who, like Ryazanov or X,[3]

have been seeking a “simple”
solution of the problem, valid for all combinations. The fundamental error of
such Social-Democrats (and of all Socialists-Revolutionaries) is that they do
not adhere to the class viewpoint, and that, in seeking a universal solution of
the problem in all its combinations, they forget the dual nature of the
well-to-do and the middle peasant. They take into account, virtually, only two
classes— either landlords and “peasant and working class”, or
proprietors and proletarians. Actually, however, there are three classes, all
of which differ in their immediate and ultimate aims: the landlords, the
well-to-do peasantry and partly the middle peasantry, and, finally, the
proletariat. Actually, the task of the proletariat under these circumstances is
necessarily twofold. The entire difficulty of a Social-Democratic agrarian
programme and agrarian policy in Russia lies in defining, as clearly and
precisely as possible, the conditions under which the proletariat must observe
neutrality and the conditions under which support and “incitement”
are necessary.


There can be only one solution to this problem: with the peasant bourgeoisie
against all manner of serfdom and against the serf-owning landlords; with the
urban proletariat against the peasant bourgeoisie and every other
bourgeoisie—such is the “line” of the rural proletariat. and
of its ideologists, the Social-Democrats. In other words:
to support the peasantry and urge it on even to the point of seizing any
seigniorial “property”, no matter how “sacred”,
insofar as this peasantry acts in a revolutionary-democratic

    

manner; to be wary of the peasantry, to organise separately from it, to be ready
      to combat it, insofar as this peasantry acts in a reactionary or
    anti-proletarian manner. Or, to put it still differently: aid to the peasant
    when his struggle with the landlord contributes to the development and
    strengthening of the democratic forces; neutrality towards the peasant when
    his struggle with the landlord is merely a matter of squaring accounts
    between two factions of the landowning class, a matter to which the
    proletariat and the democrats are indifferent.


Such an answer, of course, will not satisfy people who approach the peasant
question without well thought-out theoretical views, who are intent on popular
“revolutionary” slogans calculated for effect, and who do not
understand the great and serious danger of revolutionary adventurism,
particularly in the sphere of the peasant question. In regard to such
people—of whom there are now a considerable number among us, such as the
Socialists-Revolutionaries, with the development of the revolution and of the
peasant movement promising an increase in their ranks—the Social-Democrats
must firmly uphold the standpoint of the class struggle against every kind of
revolutionary vagueness; they must contrapose to revolutionary phrase-mongering
the sober estimate of the heterogeneous elements in the peasantry. Speaking
practically and concretely, the following statement will bring us nearest the
truth: All opponents of Social-Democracy on the agrarian question fail to take
into consideration the fact that in European Russia proper there is an entire
stratum of well-to-do peasants (one and a half to two million households out of
a total of about ten million). This stratum controls no less than half of all
the implements of production and all the property owned by the peasants. It
cannot exist without employing seasonal and day labourers. It is certainly
hostile to serfdom, to the landlords, and to the bureaucracy, and is capable of
becoming democratic, but still more certain is its hostility to the rural
proletariat. Any attempt in an agrarian programme or in an agrarian policy to
tone down or ignore this class antagonism is a conscious or unconscious
departure from the socialist point of view.


Between the rural proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie lies the stratum of
the middle peasantry, whose position

    

contains features to be found in both of these antipodes. The common features in
the position of all these strata, of the peasantry as a whole, undoubtedly tend
to make the entire peasant movement democratic, great as may be the evidences
of non-class-consciousness and of reactionary sentiment in particular
instances. It is our task never to depart from the class standpoint and to
organise the closest possible union between the urban and the rural
proletariat. It is our task to clarify for ourselves and for the people the
real democratic and revolutionary content that lies in the general,
albeit vague, striving towards “land and freedom”. It is, therefore,
our task to lend the most energetic support and impetus to this striving, while
at the same time preparing the elements of socialist struggle in the countryside
as well.


To determine clearly the practical attitude of the Social-Democratic
working-class party towards the peasant movement, the Third Congress of our
Party must adopt a resolution calling for support to that movement. The
following is the draft of such a resolution formulating the above views, which
have repeatedly been amplified in Social-Democratic literature; it must now be
discussed in the widest possible circle of Party functionaries:


“The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, as the party of the
class-conscious proletariat, strives to bring about the complete emancipation of
all working people from every kind of exploitation, and supports every
revolutionary movement against the present social and political
system. Therefore, the R.S.D.L.P. strongly supports the present-day peasant
movement, among others, and stands for all revolutionary measures capable of
improving the condition of the peasantry, not halting at the expropriation of
the landed estates to this end. At the same time, as the class party of the
proletariat, the R.S.D.L.P. works undeviatingly towards an independent class
organisation of the rural proletarians, ever mindful of its obligation to make
clear to them the antagonism of their interests to those of the peasant
bourgeoisie, to bring them to understand that only the common struggle of the
rural and the urban proletariat against the whole of bourgeois society can lead
to the socialist revolution, which alone is capable of really freeing the mass
of the rural poor from poverty and exploitation.

 

“As a practical slogan for agitation among the peasantry, and as a means of
      instilling the utmost political consciousness into this movement, the
      R.S.D.L.P. proposes the immediate formation of revolutionary peasant
      committees for all-round support of all democratic reforms and for their
      implementation in detail. In these committees as well the R.S.D.L.P. will
      strive for an independent organisation of the rural proletarians for the
      purpose of supporting the entire peasantry in all its
      revolutionary-democratic actions, on the one hand, and, on the other, of
      safeguarding the true interests of the rural proletariat in its struggle
      against the peasant bourgeoisie.”

(The Advice of a General of the Commune)

Editors’ foreword: The article presented below is a translation from the
memoirs of Cluseret, a famous leader of the Paris Commune. As is evident from
the short biographical sketch here given, Cluseret based his considerations
chiefly, though not exclusively, on the experience of the Paris street
uprisings. Moreover, he had in mind specifically a revolution of the
proletariat against all propertied classes, whereas we in Russia are now
experiencing a revolution which is largely a movement of the whole people
against the government clique. It goes without saying, therefore, that
Cluseret’s original ideas should serve the Russian proletariat only as material
for an independent analysis of the experience of the West-European comrades with
a view to its adaptation to our own conditions. We believe it would be useful to
acquaint the reader briefly with the author’s life, which is not devoid of
interest.


Gustave-Paul Cluseret was born in Paris on June 13, 1823. He studied at the
Military School of Saint-Cyr, from which he graduated in 1843 as a second
lieutenant. In 1848, with the rank of lieutenant, he took a very active part in
suppressing the workers’ revolt in Paris (the June Days). Within six hours he
took eleven barricades and captured three banners. For this “heroic
deed” he was awarded the Order of the Legion of Honour. In 1855, now a
captain, he fought in the Crimean campaign, and then retired. He served under
Garibaldi in Italy’s war of liberation. In 1861 he went to America, where he
fought in the Civil War against the slave states. He was raised to the rank of
general and (after the victory at Cross Keys) was granted American
citizenship. He then

    

returned to France. In 1868 he received a prison term for his articles in the
      newspaper L’Art. In Sainte-Pélagie prison he became connected
    with leaders of the International. His sharp military criticisms in the
    newspapers resulted in his deportation as an American citizen. Upon the
    proclamation of the Republic (September 4, 1870), he returned to Paris and
    took part in the attempts at a revolt in Lyons and in Marseilles. On April
    3, 1871, he was appointed Minister of War of the Commune. On April 16, he
    was elected a member of the Commune. For surrendering Fort Issy he was
    dismissed by the Commune and arrested,but he was acquitted by a court of
    honour. After the amnesty of 1881 he returned to France and contributed to
    the newspapers La Commune and La Marseillaise. He was
    sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for inciting the army to
    insubordination and fled from France. In the 1888 elections to the Chamber
    of Deputies he was a candidate of the Revolutionary Party. He waged a
    zealous campaign against parliamentarism and the “Clemencist”
    Radical Party. In 1889 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies by the
    second arrondissement of Toulon. Belonged to the Socialist Labour
    group. Wrote a book The Army and Democracy (1869) and two volumes
    of Memoirs (1887) dealing with the Commune.

Knock, and it shall be opened unto you, we said after reading the Party
Council’s resolution of March 10, 1905, in Iskra, No. 91. No sooner had
the news of the Council’s resolution of March 8, 1905, and our answer in issue
No. 10 of

   Vperyod[1]

 reached Russia, than we find ourselves confronted
with a remarkable new change of front on the part of the Council, a change for
which we can only congratulate our comrades of the new Iskra with all
our heart and wish them to take a further step in the same direction.


The Council’s resolution of March 10 addresses itself to the participants at the
Third Party Congress that is being convened by the Russian Bureau, proposing
that the Congress accept the mediation of the German Party and of Bebel to wards
restoring Party unity, and expresses the Council’s consent to send two
representatives to the Congress for talks on implementing the idea of
arbitration.


In taking this first step “on the new path”, the Council,
of course, could not help employing some of its old methods; it could not help
repeating an untruth, the inherent absurdity of which we exposed in
Vperyod, No. 10, namely, that the Congress, which is being called by a
majority of the Russian committees, is not a Party Congress, but that “an
insignificant group of Party members” wants “to force its decisions on the real majority of the Party”. These ruses would be pathetic
were they not so ridiculous, and we should not care to dwell on them again, all
the more so since our attention now is naturally drawn to the new step taken by
the

    

Council, which at last (at long last!) has realised the importance of the Party
      Congress as a means of resolving the Party crisis and has finally made the
      first, albeit feeble, timid, and inconsistent attempt—but still an
      attempt—to look at things simply, to call a spade a spade, and to
      essay a path, a “new path”, for restoring Party unity by means
      of direct talks between the two sections of the Party that arose after the
      Second Congress.


Excellent! It should have been done long ago. The party of the proletariat would
have been spared many months of excruciating, senseless, drawn-out crisis and
clandestine splitting. A slightly more serious and sincere desire to reckon
openly and frankly with the will of the Party functionaries working in Russia
would have helped Russian Social-Democracy out of its temporary state of
disintegration a full year ago. Yes, a year ago, even sooner.


It was at the end of January 1904. The Party Council met for the first time to
discuss the new situation in the Party and the Party crisis, with Plekhanov,
Axelrod, Martov, Vasilyev,[3]

and Lenin attending. The last two,
members of the Central Committee and adherents of the Majority, saw clearly
that the Party had in tact already been split by the Minority and that
the clandestine character of the split brought an unspeakable
corruption into the Party and demoralised it completely, in that it left one
side free to employ the most reckless “brawling” methods, while the
other side was in duty bound to abide by the general decisions. The
clandestine split of the Party (in its moral and political
significance and in its moral and political consequences) stands to an
open split
approximately in the same relation as clandestine adultery to open free love.


Thus, the above-mentioned Council members proposed a resolution (January 28,
1904), which was published in full by Shakhov (The Struggle for the
Congress, p. 81), in which the Bolsheviks, although outnumbered by
their opponents both on the Editorial Board and in the Council, the highest
Party body, were the first to raise their voice for peace in the Party, in view
of the crucial problems of the historic moment. The Bolsheviks drew there a
clear line between the necessary and inevitable ideological struggle, on the one
hand, and the “mean brawling”, disorganisation, petty

    

rivalry, boycott, etc., on the other. They asked the Party Council to call on
all Party members to “sink their petty differences as quickly as possible
and keep the ideological struggle once and for all within such limits as would
not lead to breaches of the Rules and not hamper practical activities and
constructive work”. We have so many Party members with short memories who
like to speak of the Party’s independent activity, but prefer idle gossip to a
study of the documents bearing on our Party split, that we urgently recommend
to all comrades desiring to have an understanding of Party affairs that they
take a look at page 81 of the pamphlet The Struggle for the Congress.


The Mensheviks, of course, rejected the resolution pro posed by Lenin and
Vasilyev and adopted (Plekhanov, Martov, and Axelrod) a resolution asking the
Central Committee to “co-opt” the Mensheviks. Since the Central
Committee had on November 26, 1903, agreed to co-opt two Mensheviks of
its own choice, this resolution of the Council could only mean that
three definite individuals were being forced upon the C.C. Now the
entire Party knows from published documents (Lenin’s

 Statement)[2]

that
it was because of these “three” that differences on points of
principle were invented and a “mean brawling” was engaged in up
to November 1904. In reply to the resolution on co-optation, Lenin and
Vasilyev submitted a dissenting report (Shakhov, p. 84), which likewise we
recommend to the uninformed and the forgetful to read for their own
edification. This report stated that these members of the C.C. “positively
and emphatically fail to see any honest and right way out of the present Party
dissensions, any way of stopping this impermissible struggle over the
composition of the centres other than the immediate convocation of a Party
congress


The Mensheviks, of course, are sabotaging the Congress. No reminders that at the
Congress compromises of all kinds are permissible, that otherwise the struggle
will assume the same revolting form as clandestine and mercenary love, produce
any effect on them. Incidentally, while such tactics may be natural and
understandable in the case of the Mensheviks, seeing that they have decided not
to be embarrassed

    

by “mercenary love”, in the case of the conciliator
    Plekhanov this is an enormous mistake, which has become obvious during the
    further progress of the crisis. Now anybody and everybody sees, and knows
    from the facts (namely, from the facts of Glebov[4]

and Company’s
    subsequent behaviour) that had Plekhanov voted in January 1904 for a
    Congress, the Congress would have been convened very quickly and such an
      imposing conciliatory party would have been formed at the Congress
    that it would have given no preponderance whatever to
    either the Majority or the Minority. We repeat, this is no mere conjecture,
    but a reflection that has been definitely confirmed by the
    subsequent course of events. But Plekhanov, too, preferred “mercenary
    love”, viz., a clandestine split, to an attempt to talk things over
    directly and openly until a definite agreement would be achieved.


What do we see now? The Mensheviks have to accept, albeit timidly,
inconsistently, and belatedly, the solution proposed by the Bolsheviks. The
Bolsheviks stuck to their guns and succeeded in having the Congress called,
rightly maintaining that if the two “better halves” are not destined
to go on “cohabiting”, they must part openly.


Better late than never, of course, and we heartily welcome even this timid step
taken by the Council, its readiness to send two
“representatives”. But we absolutely object to the timidity and
inconsistency of this move. Why do you want to send to the Congress only two
representatives from the Council abroad, gentlemen? Why not
representatives from all Party organisations? The members of the
Russian Bureau of Committees of the Majority have, as you know, invited
everybody to the Congress, and have specially sent registered letters to the
Editorial Board, to the Council, and to the League. Why this strange and
inexplicable contradiction? On the one hand, when it came to securing a
hypocritical peace with the three knights-errant of the Central
Committee (in deliberate violation of the will of the Committees of the
Majority) you did not rest content with sending “two
representatives” from the Council, but canvassed all the
committees and
organisations of the Minority, as was openly stated in issue No. 83 of
Iskra. On the other hand, when it comes to securing real peace
with the entire Party, you send for “direct talks” only two
representatives, and those from the

    

Council abroad alone. Where are the Russian Mensheviks, with whom it is a
hundred times more important for us to come to terms than with a coterie of
littérateurs? Where are the workers, the members and spokesmen
of the organisations—those very workers whom you incited against the
Second Congress, and about whose independent activity you shouted so much? Where
are Comrades Akimov and Brouckère, Makhov and Yegorov (or their friends and
comrades-in-idea), who, quite consistently from their point of view, supported
the Mensheviks without, however, compromising themselves, i.e., without taking
part in the co-optation squabbles? Where are Comrade Krichevsky and the other
former “Economists”, with whom you are supposed to have made peace,
as Plekhanov and many others have asserted in the new Iskra? Where is
Comrade Ryazanov, your solidarity with whom on many points we can also
understand, but who nevertheless refused to join the League, because it was
a Menshevik organisation?


Perhaps you will say that all these comrades have no credentials? But then you
yourselves write a letter to the Congress “waiving all formalities”!


No, gentlemen, you will not satisfy us with half-measures, nor can you butter
our parsnips with fine words. If you really want, speaking frankly and without
“formalities”, to work together, in the ranks of a single
organisation, then come to the Congress, all of you, and invite all the
comrades who are divided from us only in matters of ideology and not of
co-optation. Then reckon with the “good will of revolutionaries”,
to which you so fatuously referred when trying to hide from the Congress, and
which alone can positively and conclusively decide the fate of the
whole Party represented at the Congress. Then look for mediators
capable of influencing the “good will” of all members of the
Congress. We shall heartily welcome every such mediator.


Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.... What we Bolsheviks have achieved by
our open struggle is that we have come very close to a possibly direct and
unequivocal way out of the crisis. We have succeeded in getting the Congress. We
have succeeded in getting the Mensheviks to change over from the
drill-sergeant methods of the Party Council that has been left without a party
to a straightforward, open offer

    

of direct negotiations. Whether or not the Council will be sensible and honest
      enough to take the second step along the “new path”, we are
      convinced in any case that we shall win the complete victory of the Party
      principle over circle narrowness.

By insisting that the draft programme was not written by me, Plekhanov
is the first to carry our disputes over the matter into the open in the form of
insinuations, rebukes, and reproaches. Unfortunately, he does not expound these
disputes, but confines himself to gossip—to a statement, which though it
may be piquant, is vague and unverifiable. Therefore, to my colleague’s article
against Plekhanov I must add that I have documentary evidence concerning our
disputes during the discussion of the draft programme and that I shall publish
this evidence when occasion offers. The readers will then see: (1) that
Plekhanov’s assertion that our relations cooled on account of What Is To Be
Done? is absolutely untrue; they cooled because the Board of six, in the
dispute over the programme, split into two halves; (2) that I advocated the
thesis of the displacement of small- scale industry by large-scale industry and
had it included in the programme. Plekhanov sought to confine himself to a
nebulous expression in the nature of the famous “more or less”; (3)
that I advocated and secured the substitution of the term
“proletariat” for that of “toiling and exploited masses”
in the passage dealing with the class character of our Party; and (4) that
Plekhanov, when my adherents and I among the six on the Board criticised him for
the fact that in his draft the proletarian character of our Party had not been
brought out with sufficient clarity, parried with the counter charge that I
understood the proletarian character of the Party the way Martynov does.

(A Letter to the Third Congress)

The new peasant movement, which is daily growing and gathering strength, is
again forcing the question of our agrarian programme to the fore. The basic
principle underlying this programme cannot, of course, give rise to differences
of opinion and discussions. The party of the proletariat must support the
movement of the peasantry. It will never defend the present system of
landlordism against the revolutionary onset of the peasantry, but at the same
time it will always strive to develop the class struggle in the countryside and
to introduce political consciousness into this struggle. These principles, I
believe, are shared by all Social-Democrats. Opinion is divided only when it
comes to putting the principles into practice, when it comes to formulating
them in a programme to meet the tasks of the moment.


Reality is the best arbiter of all theoretical differences, and I am confident
that the rapid march of revolutionary events will eliminate also these
differences on the agrarian question in the Social-Democratic movement. Hardly
any one will deny that it is not our business to indulge in project mongering
for all manner of land-reform schemes, or that we must strengthen the ties with
the proletariat and support the peasant movement, without however
losing sight of the possessive tendencies of the peasant
proprietor—tendencies whose antagonism to the proletariat will be all the
more rapidly and sharply revealed the more rapidly the revolution advances.


On the other hand, the present revolutionary moment plainly calls for a
thoroughly definite and concrete slogan. The formation of revolutionary
peasant committees must

    

become that slogan, and our Party’s agrarian programme has quite correctly
advanced it. There is a great amount of ignorance and backwardness in the
peasant movement, and it would be extremely dangerous to cherish any illusions
on that score. The ignorance of the peasant is revealed, first of all, in his
failure to perceive the political aspect of the movement, to perceive,
for instance, that without radical democratic changes in the entire
political structure of the entire state it is absolutely impossible to
make any lasting progress in the direction of extending the ownership of the
land. The peasant needs land, and his revolutionary feeling, his instinctive,
primitive sense of democracy cannot express itself otherwise than by
laying hands on the landlords’ land. No one will attempt to dispute this, of
course. The Socialists-Revolutionaries let it go at that instead of analysing
these vague aspirations of the peasantry from the class point of view. The
Social-Democrats maintain, on the basis of such an analysis, that it is scarcely
possible for the entire peasantry to go solid on any issue beyond the
demand for the return of the cut-off lands,[2]

for when the limits of
such an agrarian reform are exceeded, the antagonism between the rural proletariat and the “enterprising muzhiks” will inevitably assert
itself more sharply than ever.The Social-Democrats, of course, can have no
objection to the insurgent muzhik’s “dealing the landlord the final
blow” and to his taking all his land away from him, but they
cannot embark on adventurism in a proletarian programme, they cannot let the
class struggle against the property-owners be obscured by roseate prospects of
such changes in the landowning system (even though these changes may be
democratic) as would merely reshuffle the classes or categories of
property-owners.


Until now our programme contained the demand for the return of the cut-off
lands, while the various commentaries on the programme pointed out that the
cut-off lands are not a barrier, but “a door leading

       farther”[1]

,

and that
the proletariat would gladly support the peasantry in this further advance,
while having to keep a watchful eye on its temporary ally, the peasant
proprietor, lest he

    

show his proprietary teeth. Now, in face of the revolutionary events, the
      question naturally arises whether it would not be more appropriate to
      transfer such a statement of our tactics from the commentaries to
    the programme proper. After all, the programme is the official general
    Party expression of the views of Social-Democracy, whereas a commentary
    necessarily represents the more or less personal views of this or that
    Social-Democrat. Would it not, therefore, be wiser to put into the programme
    a more general statement of our policy on this question, and leave it to the
    commentaries to elaborate on specific measures and separate demands, as,
    for instance, the cut-off lands?


To clarify my idea, I shall state here how the corresponding place in our
programme ought to be formulated: (The R.S.D.L.P. demands above
all)... "(4) the formation of revolutionary peasant committees for the
purpose of eliminating all remnants of the serf-owning system, transforming all
rural relations in general along democratic lines, taking revolutionary measures
to improve the lot of the peasantry, even to the extent of taking the land away
from the landlords. Social-Democracy will back the peasantry in all its
revolutionary-democratic undertakings, while at the same time defending the
independent interests and the independent organisation of the rural
proletariat.”


The proposed formulation introduces into the programme what has hitherto usually
been elaborated in the commentaries and transfers the cut-off lands from the
programme to them. Such a change has the advantage of bringing out more clearly
in the programme the specific, independent character of the proletarian
position; and clarity on such an important issue outweighs all editorial
inconveniences (such as the inclusion in the programme of an explanation usually
placed in the commentaries, instead of a definite demand; we might mention,
incidentally, that our programme contains such explanations: compare, for
instance, the clause on combating reforms that tend to consolidate the tutelage
of the police and the bureaucracy).[3]

Another advantage is that the
programme quashes once and for all the absurd idea alleging that the
Social-Democrats tell the peasants they cannot and must not go beyond the
cut-off lands. We must dispel this idea by a clear formulation in the programme,
and not

    

confine ourselves to explaining it in the commentaries. The fact that no
concrete methods for expropriating the land are mentioned in the proposed
formulation may appear to be a defect. But is it, strictly speaking, a defect?


Social-Democrats who have written on the agrarian question have pointed out
repeatedly how inappropriate it is for us to occupy ourselves with
project-mongering in this connection, since the chief measure of an agrarian reform— nationalisation of the land—would, in a police-ridden
state, necessarily be perverted and would serve only to obscure the class
nature of the movement. Yet all other measures for transforming agrarian
relations will, under the capitalist system, be only an approach to
nationalisation; they will be only partial measures, only a few of the possible
measures, i.e., measures to which Social-Democracy has no intention whatever
of restricting itself. At the present time the Social-Democrats are
against nationalisation, and even the Socialists-Revolutionaries, under the
influence of our criticism, have become much more cautious on the subject
(compare their draft programme with their former “élan”).


But the point is that the revolutionary movement leads us towards the democratic
republic, which, with the abolition of the standing army, etc., constitutes one
of our immediate. demands.


In a democratic republic, with the people armed and with other measures of a
like republican character realised, Social-Democracy cannot renounce
nationalisation of the land and thereby tie their own hands on this issue. Thus,
the defect in the formulation I propose is only an apparent one. In point of
fact, this formulation provides a consistent class slogan for the present
moment—-indeed, an absolutely concrete slogan—while leaving ample
scope for the “revolutionary-democratic” measures which may prove
necessary or desirable in the event of a favourable development of our
revolution. At the present time, as well as in the future, pending the complete
victory of the peasant uprising, a revolutionary slogan must necessarily take
into account the antagonism between peasant and landlord; and the
cut-off lands clause quite correctly emphasised this circumstance. On the other
hand, all and every “nationalisation”, “transfer of
rents”,

    

"socialisation”, etc., ignore and obscure this characteristic
      antagonism, and therein lies their defect.


At the same time, the formulation I propose widens the aims of the revolutionary
peasant committees to include “transforming all rural relations in general
along democratic lines”. The peasant committees are presented as a
slogan in our programme, which correctly characterises them as peasant,
i.e., social-estate, in essence, since oppression of one social-estate by
another can be destroyed only by the whole of the lower, oppressed estate. But
is there any reason for confining the aims of these committees to agrarian
reforms? Must other committees really be set up for other,
e.g., administrative, reforms? The trouble with the peasants, as I
have previously pointed
out, is their utter failure to perceive the political aspect of the movement. If
we could succeed, even in a few instances, in connecting the effective
revolutionary measures taken by the peasantry to improve their position
(confiscation of grain, of livestock, and of land) with the formation
and activity of peasant committees and with the full sanctioning of
these committees by the revolutionary parties (and, under especially favourable
conditions, by a provisional revolutionary government), we could consider the
struggle to win the peasants for the democratic republic as won. Unless the
peasantry is thus won over, all its revolutionary steps will be very insecure,
and all its gains will easily be wrested from it by the social classes in power.


Finally, in speaking of supporting “revolutionary-democratic”
measures, the proposed formulation draws a clear line between the deceptive,
pseudo-socialist appearance of such measures as the peasant seizure of
land and their actual democratic content. To realise how important it is for a
Social-Democrat to draw such a line, it suffices to recall the attitude of Marx
and Engels towards the agrarian movement, for instance, in America (Marx in 1848
on Kriege,[4]

Engels in 1885 on Henry George[5]).

Today, of
course, no one will attempt to deny the existence of a peasant war for
land, of the land fever (in semi-feudal countries or in the colonies). We fully
recognise its legitimacy and its progressiveness, but at the same time we reveal
its democratic, i.e., in the final analysis, its bourgeois-democratic
content. Therefore,

    

while endorsing this content, we, for our part, make special
“reservations”; we point to the “independent” role of
the proletarian democratic movement and to the specific aims of the
Social-Democratic Party as a class party that is working for the socialist
revolution.


These are the reasons that lead me to suggest that the comrades discuss my
proposal at the forthcoming Congress and broaden the corresponding clause of the
programme in the direction I propose.

Geneva, March 29 (16)


We have just received the following report from Tver:
“A periphery meeting held jointly with the Committee on March 9, and
attended by a representative of the Central Committee, discussed the question of
the attitude to the Third Party Congress which is being convened by the
C.C. (appeal to the Party dated March 4, 1905).The resolution of the Tver
Committee was read out: ’The Tver Committee welcomes the call of the Central
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. to prepare for the Third Party Congress (resolution
of the C.C. dated March 4,1905) and it has resolved at its meeting to
participate in the Congress by sending a delegate. In view, however, of the
statement made by the Tver Committee to a representative of the Organising
Bureau about participating in the Congress organised by that Bureau, the Tver
Committee feels obligated to point out that this statement was made in response
to the Bureau

   representative’s[1]

assurance of the C.C. decision to make
the Congress then in preparation a regular one."’


The periphery meeting did not support the resolution of the Tver Committee. The
following resolution was adopted

    

by a majority of seven votes to one with one abstention:
“Having at last received the call of the Central Committee to prepare for
the immediate convocation of the Third Congress, and welcoming this act of the
C.C., we declare that we have already decided to take part in the Party
Congress that is being convened by the Organising Bureau. We consider it
possible to avail ourselves of the offer made by the C.C. in its appeal ’To the
Party’ dated March 4 only on the condition that a formal agreement is reached
between the C.C. and the Organising Bureau” (6 for, 3 against). To note
the mood of the other three comrades, who voted in the negative, I cite the
other resolution, offered by two of the comrades who thus voted: “The
local organisation welcomes the decision of the Central Committee to convene a
Third Party Congress and strongly urges it and the Organising Bureau to come to
an agreement between themselves. Should an agreement not eventuate, the local
organisation leaves itself a free hand.”


It follows from this report that: (1) the Tver Committee, together with the
periphery, had declared, according to the Committee’s own admission, its consent
to participate in the Congress organised by the Bureau of Committees of the
Majority; (2) subsequently, the Tver Committee, under the influence of the
C.C.’s new promises to convene the Third Congress, withdrew its consent. The
periphery, however, did not support the Committee and did not decline
to participate in the Congress which the Bureau had called; (3) the
C.C.’s new promises
to convene the Third Congress were given in the appeal “To the Party,
dated March 4, 1905”, which has so far remained unpublished and is unknown to
us.


To appraise the behaviour of our famous C.C. at its true worth, we would remind
our comrades, first, of the Party Rules, and secondly, of certain
facts. According to the Rules a congress is convened by the Council,
and not by the Central Committee. Consequently, the C.C. is giving promises it
cannot live up to. It promises to do what, under the Rules, it cannot do. The
C.C. promises or proposes, but the Council disposes. As for those members of
the Party who are naïve enough to lend an ear to the C.C.’s promises and are
unfamiliar with the Rules, they find themselves in the position of dupes. How
the Council “disposes” the facts reveal. In its resolution of March
8 (new style) the Council declares

    

(Iskra, No. 89) that “with the assent of the majority of the
      Party workers” (perhaps including the Tver Committee?)
    “it considers it inexpedient to convene the Party Congress at such
      a moment”. Can anything be clearer? Does this not show that the
    Council, time and again, is shamelessly deceiving the Party, since it never
    did have the “assent” of the “majority of Party workers”?


Further, on March 10 (N.S.), that is, two days later, the Council adopted
another resolution (Iskra, No. 91) agreeing to send two representatives
to the Congress convened by the Russian Bureau of Committees of the Majority,
but saying not a word about agreeing to the convening of the Congress.


We would add that the Council not only takes a position officially against the
“expediency” of convening the Congress but rigs the votes to the
Congress by increasing the number of allegedly qualified committees and
refusing to inform the Party which now committees it considers to be accredited
and when they were accredited. In the resolution of the Council of March 8
(discussed in Vperyod,

No. 10[2]

),

the

commit tees 

 considered qualified
as of January 1,1905, were those of Polesye, the North-West, Kuban, and Kazan,
whereas the last two committees were not accredited at all by the C.C. and the
former will not be qualified until April 1, 1905.


We ask the Party members who wish to be real and not just registered members
whether they are going to stand for this game. The Council rigs the votes and
declares against the Congress, while the C.C. gives “promises” as
regards the Congress, taking advantage of the naïveté of people
who do not know
that according to the Rules these promises can have no formal
weight. Do not the facts wholly confirm what we wrote on February 28
(15) in Vperyod, No. 8, at the first reports of the C.C. ’s
“assent” to the Congress? We would remark that a month has
passed since then, that Iskra has since issued Nos. 88, 89, 90,
91, and 92 (dated March 10, 0.5.) without saying a word on this
“ticklish” question of the C.C.’s “assent” to the
Congress. We can only repeat what we said in Vperyod, No. 8:



“We have just received a report that can be interpreted to mean that the
Central Committee agrees to an immediate congress. We can

    

in no way vouch for the authenticity of the report at the present moment, but
we consider it probable. The C.C. has campaigned against the Congress for many
months; it has cashiered the organisations and boycott ed and disorganised the
committees that have declared for the Congress. These tactics have failed. Now,
following the rule ’expediency is everything, formality is nothing’, the C.C.,
for the sake of ’expediency’
(that is, for the sake of preventing the Congress) is prepared formally
to declare a hundred times if need he that it is for the immediate

con vocation 

of the Congress. We hope that neither the Bureau nor the local committees will
let themselves be deceived by the subterfuges of the Party’s
’Shidlovsky Commission’."[3]



P.S. Geneva, March 30 (17). We are obliged to keep a regular diary of
the C.C.’s subterfuges. We have received the following letter of the C.C. to the
Bureau of Committees of the Majority:


“The Central Committee decided on March 4 to call upon the committees of
the Party to prepare for the Third Congress of the Party and on its part has
decided to take steps to convene the Congress at the earliest possible date.


“Since the success of an all-Party congress and its speedy
convocation depend on the unanimous collaboration of the utmost possible number
of all comrades and organisations that are declaring now for the
Congress, the C.C. proposes to the Organising Bureau of Committees of the
so-called ’Majority’ to enter into an agreement on this matter and work together
towards convening the Congress speedily and to wards ensuring the fullest
possible representation of the entire Party. March 6,1905. C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P.”


Infinite indeed is the long-suffering patience of the Russian committees and
their credulity! Why does not the C.C. publish its appeal of March 4? Why does
it mouth mendacious phrases about an “agreement” with the Bureau?
The Bureau invited everyone to the Congress without exception, the
entire Party; it did so over a month ago openly and publicly. The
Bureau answered the C.C. long since that no delays were now
possible. Everyone who wants an all-Party congress not merely
in words is invited; it’s as clear as that. Besides, what sense would there be
in an agreement between the Bureau and the C.C., when it is not the C.C. that
convenes the Congress under the Rules but the Council, which has gone on record
against the Congress?

 

It is to be hoped that everyone now will see through the double game
    which the Council and the C.C. are playing. The Bureau, we are sure, will
    not retreat a single step from its work of convening the Congress upon the
    date it has set for it and of which it has notified the C.C.

 

Notes
 

[1]

The representative of the Bureau of Committees of the Majority, who
made the report on the Third Congress. at a meeting of the Tver Committee
and the periphery in February, informs us that this assertion of the Tver
Committee is “inaccurate”. “I told them”, he declares, “according to
the direct statement of C.C. member
Nikitich,[4]
that the C.C. had intended to announce the Third Congress, thus
making the Congress convened by the Bureau a regular congress by agreement,
hut that it had not had time for various reasons to enter into
official negotiations with the Bureau on the question.”
—Lenin

[3]

The Shidlovsky Commission (headed by Senator
Shidlovsky) was set up by the tsarist government on January 29 (February 11),
1905, “to enquire into tile causes of the discontent among the
workers”, but actually to deceive the workers and draw them away from the
revolutionary struggle. Speaking of the “subterfuges of the Party’s
Shidlovsky Commission’ " Lenin had in mind the double-dealing of the Central
Committee, where the Mensheviks had seized control and which formally went on
record for a Third Congress while actually opposing the convocation of the Party
Congress.

An important question in connection with the Russian
revolution is the following:


I. Will it go on to the complete overthrow of the tsarist government
and the establishment of a republic?


II. Or will it limit itself to a curtailment of tsarist power, to a monarchist
constitution?


In other words, are we to have a revolution of the 1789 type or of the 1848

type?[1]

 (We say type in order to dispose of the preposterous idea that
there can be any repetition of the irrevocably vanished social, political, and
international situations of 1789 and 1848.)


That a Social-Democrat must want and work for the
former, of this there can hardly be any doubt.


Yet Martynov’s way of stating the issue reduces itself wholly to a tail-ender’s
desire for a more modest revolution. In type lithe “danger”, so
frightening to the Martynovs, of the proletariat and the peasantry seizing power
is entirely eliminated. In this case Social-Democracy will unavoidably remain
“in opposition”—even to the revolution; this indeed is what
Martynov wants—to remain in opposition even to
the revolution.


The question is, which type is the more probable?


In favour of type I we have: (1) An immeasurably greater store of resentment and
revolutionary feeling among the lower classes in Russia than there was in the
Germany of 1848. With us the change is sharper; with us there have been

    

no intermediate stages between autocracy and political freedom (the
    Zemstvo does not count); with us despotism is Asiatically virginal. (2)
    With us a disastrous war increases the likelihood of a severe
    collapse, for it has involved the tsarist government completely. (3) With us
    the international situation is more favourable, for proletarian Europe will
    make it impossible for the crowned heads of Europe to help the Russian
    monarchy. (4) With us the development, of class-conscious revolutionary
    parties, their literature and organisation, is on a much higher level than
    it was in 1789, 1848, or 1871. (5) With us the various nationalities
    oppressed by tsarism, such as the Poles and Finns, provide a
    powerful impulse to the attack on the autocracy. (6) With us the
    peasantry is in
    particularly sorry plight; it is incredibly impoverished and has absolutely
    nothing to lose.


Of course, all these considerations are by far not absolute. Others may be
contraposed to them:

 (1) We have very few survivals of feudalism.

(2) The
government is more experienced and has greater facilities for detecting the
danger of revolution.

 (3) The spontaneity of a revolutionary outburst is
complicated by the war, which creates problems that have no bearing on the
revolution. The war demonstrates the weakness of the Russian revolutionary
classes, which would not have had the strength to rise without it (cf. Karl
Kautsky in The Social Revolution).

(4) Other countries provide no stimulus to a revolution in ours.

(5) The national movements towards the dismemberment of Russia are
likely to tear the bulk of t.he Russian big and petty bourgeoisie away
from our revolution.

(6) The antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie with us
is much deeper than it was in 1789, 1848, or 1871; hence, the
bourgeoisie will be more fearful of the proletarian
revolution and will throw itself more readily into the arms of
reaction.



Only history, of course, can weigh these pros and cons in the balances. Our task
as Social-Democrats is to drive the bourgeois revolution onward as far
as it will go, without ever losing sight of our main task—the
independent organisation of the proletariat.


This is where Martynov gets muddled. The complete revolution means seizure of
power by the proletariat and the poor peasantry. These classes, once in
power, cannot but

    

strive for the socialist revolution. Ergo, seizure of power,
from being at first a step in the democratic revolution, will, by force
of circumstances, and against the will (and sometimes without the awareness) of
its participants,

p a s s   i n t o

 the socialist revolution. And here
failure is inevitable. If attempts at the socialist revolution are bound to
end in failure, we must (like Marx in 1871, when he foresaw the inevitable
failure of the insurrection in Paris) advise the proletariat not to
rise, but to wait and organise, reculer pour mieux

     sauter.[2]


Such, in substance, is Martynov’s idea (and that of the new
Iskra, too), had he been able to reason it out to its logical end.

 

Notes
 

[1]

N.B. Some might add here “or of the 1871 type”? This question must be
considered as a probable objection raised against us by many
non-Social-Democrats.—Lenin

Comrades, you all know what a distressing crisis our Party has been passing
through these past eighteen months and more. Ever since the Second Party
Congress, owing to a series of deplorable circumstances, the central bodies of
our Party abroad—the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and the
Council—have come under the control of the adherents of the Party
Congress Minority. The dissatisfaction among our Party workers continued to grow
and developed into a concealed, intense struggle, which seriously hampered the
entire activity of Social-Democracy and impaired the prestige of the proletarian
party. Seeing the harm this secret split was causing, the Party committees began
to demand the convening of the Third Congress as the only party way out of the
crisis. The struggle for the Congress has been the vitalising breath of the
Party activities since the spring of 1904. The Party Council abroad opposed the
idea of the Congress in every way it could. The Central Committee sought to
meet the demands of the Minority in the matter of co-optation in the hope
thereby to restore peace within the Party. But this hope was dashed. Instead of
peace being restored, the struggle was intensified.


The ensuing great events in the development of the working-class movement and
the revolution in Russia, the events of January 9 and its after effects, created
a new situation which taxed the Party’s powers and energies still more. For the
overwhelming majority of the Party workers in Russia the Congress became a
pressing need. The resistance of the Council abroad resulted in the election by
a number of committees in Russia of a special Bureau for convening the Party
Congress. Under the circumstances the C.C.

    

deemed it its party duty to join the Bureau of Committees of the Majority for
the immediate convening of the Party Congress.


The need for the Congress, even from a narrow formal point of view, is borne out
by the following. The members of the Party learned from issue No. 89 of
Iskra that, apart from the central bodies, the Party
Council considered 33 organisations qualified. Consequently, even on this count
(disputed by a large number of Party workers, who set the number of Party
organisations at 31) 38 votes were required to make the convocation of the
Congress obligatory
(33x2=66; 66+9=75; 75 : 2=37 1/2 ½).


The thirteen committees that elected the Bureau of Committees of the Majority
have long since declared for the Congress. The 13 have been joined by the
committees of the Urals, Tula, Voronezh, Samara, the North-West, Smolensk,
Kharkov, and Kazan, i.e., by 8 committees. These 21 committees, together with
the four votes of the C.C. (two votes of the C.C. itself and two of its
delegates on the Council), give 42+4=46 votes.

In issue No. 11 of Vperyod we hailed the first step of the Party
Council which was Left without a

party.[1]

We asked ourselves whether the Council
would have the sense and honesty to make the second step along its new
path. Now we have just received news from Russia that the Central Committee
has made the second step. We are able to publish immediately the following
documents in the case.


1) Appeal of the Central Committee to the Party of March 4,
1905.



To the Party


Comrades, the revolution in Russia has begun! Its prelude has proved in the most
incontrovertible manner that the principal force deciding its outcome is the
urban proletariat. However, in the matter of speeding the issue of the
revolution, of bringing system into the revolutionary struggle of the masses,
and, especially, of turning the results of the revolution to the fullest account
in favour of the proletariat, a great deal depends on the actual state of our
Party’s forces and its organisation. History has imposed upon our Party the
political and moral responsibility towards the Russian proletariat, towards our
whole nation, and, lastly, towards the proletariat the world over. In its
present state our Party is not capable of fulfilling its obligations to the
extent necessary and possible, considering the potential strength of Russian
Social-Democracy. The C.C. deems it untimely and useless at the present juncture
to prove, chapter and verse, whether and to what extent certain prominent Party
members, influential groups, and entire Party bodies were guided in their
inner-Party activities by

pro found 

political motives or by intellectualist
politicking; in short, with out trying to apportion the blame for the deep-going
disorganisation of the Party, the C.C., fully realising the weight of the
responsibility that rests upon it, declares before the whole Party that it has
firmly decided to do everything in its power to ensure necessary unity in the
Party and prevent a final split. The development of the revolution confronts

    

Russian Social-Democracy almost daily with new problems. Many of these
issues have barely been touched upon by our tactics, which were evolved chiefly
for “peace-time” use. Others have no precedent whatever in former
Party practice, since they have arisen from new causes which never existed
before. Party literature, of course, is a help, but its answers do not always
satisfy local workers as regards adequacy, unity, and generally recognised
competence. Quite recently a considerable number of committees, which united
after private meetings, have adopted a policy of distrust towards the central
bodies of the Party, existing by virtue of the Party Rules adopted at the Second
Congress of the Party, and have carried this policy to the extent of forming
their own organ and their own centre, and are at present engaged in convening
their own congress. Finally, the time set by the Party Rules far convening the
Third regular Congress falls due this summer.


Under the circumstances the C.C. considers that the only and final means of
avoiding a split is the convening of the all-Party Congress in the very near
future.


Convinced that the useful results of the Congress, in the sense both of dealing
with the vital tasks that the present political situation has put before our
Party and of achieving real, lasting unity in the Party, will depend entirely on
the broad and full representation of all the important and influential currents
at the Congress, the C.C., in pursuance of the Rules, has decided, in the
interests of fuller representation, to make wide use of its right to invite to
the Congress comrades with consultative voice. In view of the fact that the
dissensions which have been rending the Party have led in some places to a
complete break-away of major groups from the committees, and in others to sharp
antagonism between committees and peripheries, the C.C. invites the following
bodies to send their own delegates to the Congress with consultative voice:

(1) all groups that broke away from the committees prior to March
1, 1905;

(2) all peripheries of large industrial centres in which there are
20,000 workers or over in the area of the committee’s activity and where over
half the periphery members vote no confidence in the local committee on the
question of the election of a delegate to the Congress.


Note. The C.C. proposes that for this purpose only those comrades
shall be considered members of the periphery who belong to a committee
organisation and engage in active revolutionary work under the direction and
control of the committee, such as propaganda, agitation, organisation, and the
writing, printing, and distribution of literature. Moreover, since the all-Party
Congress, according to the Rules, is convened by the Party Council, the C.C.,
while calling upon the local committees to declare for the Third Congress as the
only means now of ensuring Party unity, will, for its part, support its decision
for the immediate convocation of the Congress through its representatives on the
Party Council, and will straight away take a number of practical preparatory
steps. In addition, the C.C. declares that it will do every thing in its power
to enlist to the business of convening the Congress the “Organising
Bureau” set up for that purpose on the initiative of several of the
committees; the preparatory work of this Bureau may help to speed and facilitate
the convening of the Congress.

 

Note. The details of enlisting the services of the “Organising
    Bureau” of Committees of the so-called “Majority” for the
    work of convening the Congress should be worked out by mutual
    agreement. Viewing the immediate convocation of the all-Party
    Congress as the last means of avoiding a split and creating real unity of
    the Party, which alone can give us the necessary strength to tackle the
    great tasks confronting Russian Social-Democracy, the Central Committee
    calls upon all members of the Party to make the most energetic
    preparations for the Congress which must urgently be
    held.


Central Committee,

R S.D. L. P. 


March 4, 1905



2) A letter of the C.C. to the Bureau of Committees of the Majority, dated March
   6, 1905.



On March 4 the Central Committee decided to call upon the committees of the
Party to prepare for the Third Congress, and for its part it decided to take
steps for convening the Congress at the earliest possible date.


Since the success of the all-Party Congress and its convocation at the
earliest possible date depend on the co-operation of all the comrades and
organisations now declaring for the Congress, the C.C. proposes to the
Organising Bureau of Committees of the so-called “Majority” to enter
into an agreement on this matter and work together for convening the Congress at
the earliest and for ensuring the fullest possible representation at the
Congress of the whole Party.


Central Committee,

R.S.D.L.P 


March 6, 1905



3) Joint appeal to the Party by the C.C. and the Bureau of Committees of the
   Majority, dated March 12, 1905.



To the Party

The Central Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the Majority have taken
upon themselves the initiative for convening the Third Congress of the Party and
notify all Party organisations that, proceeding from the urgent need for
immediately holding the Third Party Congress to establish the general line of
Party tactics and the Party’s organisational unity, they have come to an
agreement for the joint organisation of the Congress on the following basis:


1) The Congress is to be convened on the basis of the programmes set forth in
   the declarations of the Central Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the
   Majority; these programmes provide for the following agenda:


(a) Constitution of the Congress;

(b) questions of Party tactics;

(c) questions of Party organisation:

(1) organisation of the centres,

(2) organisation of the committees,

(3) relations between the various Party bodies and their divisions;

(d) reports;

(e) elections.


 

2) All Party organisations having the right to participate with a vote under the
   Rules of the Second Congress are invited to the Congress (viz., the four
   Caucasian committees, the Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tver, Tula,
   Nizhni-Novgorod, Northern, Kiev, Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, Don Region,
   Voronezh, Nikolayev, Saratov, Samara, North-Western, Polesye, and the
   Astrakhan committees, and the League; the Donets, Crimean, Ural, and Siberian

       leagues)[2]

;

all the rest are invited to participate with consultative voice.


3) The organising work in connection with the convening of the Third Party
   Congress so far carried out by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority is
   herewith endorsed.


4) All further work in connection with convening the

Congress Is to be 

carried
   out jointly by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority and the Central
   Committee, which form an Organising Committee.


5) The resolution of the Party Council against convening the Third Party
   Congress published in Iskra, No. 89, is not accepted by the Central
   Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the Majority as grounds for
   suspending work on organising the Congress.


March 12, 1905



The agreement between the Central Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the
Majority of March 12, 1905, is for the time being not to be made public.

 *     *  * 

We can thus celebrate a complete moral victory. Russia has gained the upper hand
over the “foreigners”. The Party spirit has triumphed over circle
parochialism. At the last minute the Central Committee saw that the Congress
which was being convened by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority was a real
Party congress and joined it. The Central Committee at the eleventh hour had
courage enough to abandon its anti-Party policy and to defy the Council
abroad. According to the Rules of our Party the Congress is convened by the
Council and not by the Central Committee. Consequently, legally speaking, no
statements or agreements on this question by the Central Committee are
valid. But when the Council violated the Rules and avoided rendering an account
to a congress, it was the duty and not only the right of the committees to take
the initiative in convening

    

the Congress; and the Central Committee, by recognising the Bureau elected by
      the committees, refused to follow the unfortunate example of the Party
      Council which was left without a party.


We cannot at the moment express any opinion on the concrete questions of the
agreement between the Central Committee and the Bureau of Committees of the
Majority. All these questions, as well as the question of the agenda,
the constitution of the Congress, etc., will, of course, be decided by
the Congress
itself. We shall therefore confine ourselves merely to wishing the Congress
success and appealing to all comrades to apply themselves immediately and with
the utmost energy to all the necessary preparations for the Congress. It is
left for us in conclusion to repeat what we said in Vperyod, No. 11,
namely, that "... we have come very close to a possibly direct and
unequivocal way out of the

       crisis.”[3]

The Social-Democratic press has repeatedly pointed out that European capital is
the saviour of Russian autocracy. Without foreign loans Russian autocracy would
not be able to survive. It was advantageous to the French bourgeoisie to support
its military ally, so long, especially, as payments on the loans were punctually
forthcoming. And the French bourgeoisie lent the autocratic government the round
little sum of ten milliard francs (about 4,000 million rubles).


However ... there is nothing eternal under the moon. The war with Japan revealed
the utter rottenness of the autocracy and ultimately undermined Russia’s credit
even with the French bourgeoisie, its “friend and ally”. In the
first place, the war showed up Russia’s military weakness; secondly, a
continuous chain of reverses, one more crushing than the other, has shown the
hopelessness of the war and the inevitability of the complete downfall of the
whole absolutist system of government; thirdly, the formidable growth of the
revolutionary movement in Russia has inspired the European bourgeoisie with a
mortal dread of an explosion that might set all Europe ablaze. Mountains of
inflammable material have piled up within the last few decades. And now all
these factors, taken together, have led ultimately to the refusal of further
loans. The recent attempt of the autocratic government to borrow from France, as
it had done in the past, ended in failure. On the one hand, capital no longer
has confidence in the autocracy; on the other, fearing a revolution, capital
wants to put pressure on the autocracy to have it conclude peace with Japan and
to come to terms with the Russian liberal bourgeoisie.

 

European capital is speculating on peace. The bourgeoisie in Europe as well as
      in Russia has begun to see the connection between war and revolution, to
      fear a really popular and victorious movement against tsarism. The
      bourgeoisie wants to preserve the “social order” of a society
      based on exploitation against excessive shocks; it wants to preserve the
      Russian monarchy as a constitutional, or pseudo-constitutional. monarchy,
      and is therefore speculating on peace in pursuance of anti-proletarian and
      anti-revolutionary interests. This indubitable fact clearly shows us that
      even so
“simple” and plain an issue as that of war and peace cannot
properly be posed if the class antagonisms of modern society are lost sight of,
if the fact is overlooked that the bourgeoisie in everything it does, howsoever
democratic or humanitarian it may appear, defends first and foremost the
interests of its own class, the interests of “social peace”, viz.,
the suppression and disarming of all oppressed classes. The proletarians’ way of
presenting the question of peace,

there fore, 

differs and must inevitably differ
from that of the bourgeois democrats, as it does on the questions of free
trade, anti-clericalism, etc. The proletariat struggles against war and will
always struggle against it unremittingly, without,

how ever, 

forgetting for a
moment that war can be abolished only with the complete abolition of society’s
division into classes; that while class rule continues to exist war cannot be
regarded only from the sentimentally democratic

stand point; 

that in a war
between exploiting nations one must distinguish between the roles of the
progressive and of the reactionary bourgeoisie of each nation. Russian
Social-Democracy has had to apply these general principles of Marxism
concretely to the
war with Japan. In dealing with the significance of this war (see
Vperyod, No. 2, the article “The Fall of

     Port Arthur”[1]

),

we
pointed out that not only our Socialists-Revolutionaries (who blamed Guesde and
Hyndman for sympathising with Japan), but also the new-Iskrists, had adopted a
false, bourgeois-democratic standpoint. With the latter this found expression,
first, in considerations of “peace at any price”, and,
secondly, in the contention that it is impermissible “to speculate on a
victory of the

    

Japanese bourgeoisie”. Both these considerations were worthy only of a
bourgeois democrat, who deals with political questions on sentimental
grounds. Reality has now shown that “peace at any price”
has become the slogan of the European financiers and reactionaries (Prince
Meshchersky in Grazhdanin[2]

now speaks clearly of the need for peace
for the salvation of the autocracy). It is now perfectly clear that
speculation on peace for the purpose of suppressing the revolution is
a speculation
of reactionaries, in contrast to the speculation of the progressive
bourgeoisie on a victory of the Japanese bourgeoisie. The new Iskra’s
phrase-mongering against “speculation” in general is actually mere
sentimental balderdash, far from the class standpoint and from any
consideration of the various social forces.


The events that have exposed the new visage of the reactionary bourgeoisie were
so glaring that now even Iskra has begun to see its error. Whereas in
issue No. 83 it “snapped back” at our article in Vperyod,
No. 2, we now read with pleasure in issue No. 90 (leader): “We should not
demand only peace; for if the autocracy continues to exist, peace will
spell ruin to the country.” Exactly: we should not demand only peace; for a
tsarist peace is no better (and is some times worse) than a tsarist war. We
should not put for ward the slogan of “peace at any price”, but only
of peace with the fall of the autocracy, of peace concluded by a liberated
nation, by a free Constituent Assembly, i.e., peace not at any price, but solely
at the price of overthrowing absolutism. Let us hope that Iskra,
having realised this, will also realise the inappropriateness of its highly
moral tirades against speculation on a victory of the Japanese bourgeoisie.


Let us return, however, to European capital and its political
“speculations”. How much tsarist Russia quails before this capital
may be seen, for instance, from the following highly instructive
incident. The Times, organ of the conservative English bourgeoisie,
published an article entitled “Is Russia Solvent?” The article described
in detail the “sub tie mechanism” of the financial manipulations of
Messrs. Witte, Kokovtsev & Co. They are always running their business at a
loss. They muddle through only by getting deeper and deeper into debt. In
between loans the proceeds of the preceding loan are placed in the Treasury,
and the “gold

    

reserve” is then triumphantly proclaimed a “free cash
      balance”. The gold obtained as a loan is shown to
      everybody as proof of
      Russia’s wealth and solvency! Small wonder that the English merchant
      compared this hanky-panky to the tricks of the Humbeds, the famous
      impostors, who used to display borrowed or swindled money (or even a safe
    purporting to contain money) in order to obtain new
    loans. The Times writes: “The frequent appearances of the
    Russian Government as a borrower in the Continental money market are due,
    not to capital requirements—that is to say, to reproductive
    enterprises or exceptional and transitory expenses— but almost
    exclusively to the normal deficiency of national income. This means that, as
    she is situated today, Russia is marching direct to insolvency. Her national
    balance-sheet leaves her every year deeper in debt. Her liabilities to the
    foreigner are more than her people can bear, and she has practically
    nothing to show for them. Her gold reserve is a colossal Humbert safe, the
    vaunted millions of which are unconsciously lent by her dupes for their own
    further deception.”


How artful! To pick a dupe, borrow money from him, then show him this very money
as evidence of your wealth, in order to wheedle further loans from him!


The comparison with those notorious swindlers, the Humbert family, was so apt
and the “gist” and purpose of the famous “free cash
balance” were so neatly nailed that that article in such a respectable
conservative newspaper created a sensation. Kokovtsev, the Minister of Finance,
personally sent a telegram to The Times, which it printed forthwith
(March 23 [10]). In his telegram the insulted Kokovtsev invited the editors of
The Times to come to St. Petersburg and verify the gold reserve in
person. The editors thanked him for the kind invitation, but declined it, on the
simple grounds that the article which had hurt the feelings of the tsar’s
servant did not in the least deny the existence of a gold reserve. The
comparison with the Humberts implied, not that Russia did not have the gold
reserve to which it referred, but that this reserve was actually made up of
other people’s money, of wholly unsecured borrowings which did not in the least
testify to Russia’s wealth, and to which it would be ridiculous to refer as
security for fresh loans!


Mr. Kokovtsev missed the point of this witty but malicious

    

comparison, and set the whole world laughing by his
telegram. Investigating gold reserves in banks was not in the range of duties
of journalists, The Times said in its reply to the Minister of
Finance. Indeed, it was the duty of the press to expose the trick played with
the aid of these really existing “gold reserves” fictitiously
displayed as evidence of the country’s wealth. The question is not whether you
have this gold reserve or not, the newspaper lectured the Russian Minister of
Finance in an article dealing with this comic telegram. We believe that you have
it. The question is, what are your assets and your liabilities? What is the
amount of your debts and what security have you? Or, more plainly put, is your
stored reserve your property, or is it borrowed and liable to be refunded,
which you cannot do in full because you do not possess so much? The English
bourgeois, making fun of the simple Minister, tried to explain to him this
none-too-subtle thing in a variety of ways, adding for his edification: If you
are looking for someone to investigate your assets and liabilities, why not call
on the representatives of the Russian people? As it happens, the people’s
representatives are keen to get together in a representative assembly, be it
called Zemsky Sobor or by some other name. Surely they will not refuse to
investigate properly, not only the famous “gold reserve”,
but all the finances of the autocracy. And they will certainly be able
to make a thorough job of it.


“Possibly”, The Times sarcastically concludes, “the
knowledge that the representative assembly would claim this office as a
right” makes the tsarist government fear the

con vocation 

of such an
assembly, “at least in any shape in which it could exercise real power.”


An insidious assertion. It is all the more insidious, all the more significant,
for being made, in reality, not by The Times, but by the entire
European bourgeoisie—made, not as a polemical manoeuvre, but as
an open expression of its distrust of the autocracy, of its unwillingness to
lend it money, of its desire to deal with the lawful representatives of the
Russian bourgeoisie. It is not an assertion, but a warning. It is not a sneer,
but an ultimatum, the ultimatum of European capital to the Russian
autocracy. While Japan’s allies, the English, word this ultimatum in the form

    

of sarcasm, Russia’s allies, the French, in their most conservative, most
      bourgeois paper, Le Temps, say the same thing, only a little more
    mildly—sugar-coating the pill, but virtually nonetheless refusing to
    lend any more, and advising the autocracy to make peace with Japan and with
    the Russian bourgeois liberals. Here is another voice, that of a no less
    respectable English magazine, The Economist:

“The truth about Russian finance is at length coming to be appreciated in
France. We have pointed out again and again that Russia has long been living on
borrowed money, that, despite glowing statements issued by succeeding Ministers
of Finance, the budgets have shown a large deficit year after year, though these
have been cunningly concealed by a book-keeping device, and that the
much-vaunted ’free cash balances’ of the Treasury consist principally
of the proceeds of loans and partly of the deposits of the State
Bank.”

After telling the
Russian autocracy these home truths, this financial magazine finds it necessary,
however, to add some bourgeois consolations to the effect that if you can man
age to make peace immediately and to make some paltry concessions to the
liberals, Europe will doubtlessly begin again to lend you millions upon
millions.


We are witnessing what is virtually a speculative gamble of the international
bourgeoisie to save Russia from revolution and tsarism from utter ruin. The
speculators are putting pressure on the tsar by refusing to grant loans. They
are making use of their power, the power of the money-bag. They want a moderate
and tidy bourgeois-constitutional (or pseudo-constitutional) regime in
Russia. The rapid march of events unites them ever more closely into a single
counter revolutionary bourgeois alliance, regardless of differences of
nationality—French financiers and English business magnates, German
capitalists, and Russian merchants. Osvobozhdeniye has acted in the
spirit of this mildly moderate bourgeois party. In issue No. 67, where he sets
forth the “programme of the Democratic Party” and even recognises
(for how long?) universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot (passing
over in modest silence the arming of the people!), Mr. Struve ends his new
profession de foi with the following characteristic statement, printed
in bold type “for the sake of importance”: “At the present
moment the demand for the immediate

    

cessation of the war should stand outside and above the programme of every
progressive party in Russia. In practice this means that the government
now existing in Russia should, through the medium of France, begin peace
negotiations with the Japanese Government.” The distinction between the
bourgeois-democratic and the Social-Democratic demands to end the war could
hardly be stated more trenchantly. The revolutionary proletariat does not put
this demand “above the programme’; it addresses it, not to “the
government now existing”, but to the free, truly sovereign
popular Constituent Assembly. The revolutionary proletariat does not
“speculate” on the mediation of the French bourgeoisie, which is
seeking peace for avowedly anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian purposes.


Finally, it is essentially with this same international party of the moderate
bourgeoisie that Mr. Bulygin is now bargaining—skilfully playing for time,
wearing his opponent down, feeding him with promises, but giving absolutely
nothing definite, and leaving everything, absolutely everything, in Russia as it
was before, beginning with the use of troops against strikers, continuing with
the arrest of political suspects and repressive measures against the press, and
ending with a dastardly incitement of the peasants against the intellectuals and
the brutal flogging of rebel peasants. And the liberals rise to the bait; some
are already beginning to believe ’Bulygin, while in the Lawyers’ Association
Mr. Kuzmin-Karavayev tries to persuade the liberals to sacrifice universal
suffrage for the sake of ... Mr. Bulygin’s blue eyes![3]


There is only one force that can stand up to the international alliance of the
moderate conservative bourgeoisie, and that is the international alliance of the
revolutionary proletariat. With respect to political solidarity, this alliance
is already fully formed. As for the practical side and the revolutionary
initiative, everything depends on Russia’s working class and the success of its
joint democratic action for the decisive struggle in conjunction with the
millions of the urban and rural poor.

Social-Democracy and the Provisional Revolutionary Government

Only five years ago many representatives of Social-Democracy thought the slogan
“Down with the Autocracy!” premature and unintelligible to the mass of the
workers. These representatives were rightly classed as opportunists. It was
explained to them again and again and finally made clear that they were lagging
behind the movement, that they did not understand the tasks of the Party as
vanguard of the class, as its leader and organiser, as the representative of the
movement as a whole and of its fundamental and principal aims. These aims might
be overshadowed for a time by the day-to-day routine, but they should never lose
their significance as the guiding star of the fighting proletariat.


Now the time has come when the flames of revolution have spread throughout the
land, and when even the most sceptical have come to believe in the inevitable
overthrow of the autocracy in the near future. But Social-Democracy, as if by
some irony of history, has to deal once more with precisely the same
reactionary and opportunist attempts to drag the movement back, to play down its
tasks, and to obscure its slogans. Polemics with the proponents of such attempts
become the task of the day, and (contrary to the opinion of the very many who
dislike intra-Party polemics) acquire tremendous practical
importance. For the nearer we get to realising our immediate political tasks,
the greater is the need to have an absolutely clear understanding of those tasks
and the more harmful is all ambiguity, all reticence and mental inconclusiveness
on this question.


And yet mental inconclusiveness is by no means a rare thing among the
Social-Democrats of the new Iskra or (what is practically the same) the
Rabocheye Dyelo camp. Down

    

with the Autocracy!—everyone agrees with this, not only all
      Social-Democrats, but all democrats, even all liberals, if one is to
      believe their current declarations. But what does it mean? How is this
      overthrow of the present government to take place? Who is to convene the
      Constituent Assembly, which even the Osvobozhdeniye people (see
    issue No. 67 of Osvobozhdeniye) are now prepared to advance as
    their slogan, including the demand for universal, direct, and equal
    suffrage? Precisely what should constitute the real guarantee that the
    elections to such an assembly will be free and will express the interests of
    the whole people?


He who fails to give a clear and definite answer to these questions does not
grasp the meaning of the slogan “Down with the Autocracy”. And these
questions inevitably bring us to the question of the provisional revolutionary
government; it is not difficult to understand that really free, popular
elections to a Constituent Assembly, fully guaranteeing truly universal, equal,
and direct suffrage by secret ballot, are not only improbable, but actually
impossible under the autocracy. And if we are in earnest in putting forward a
practical demand for the immediate overthrow of the autocratic government, we
must be clear in our minds as to precisely what other government we
want to replace the one that is to be overthrown. In other words, what do we
think should be the attitude of the Social-Democrats towards a provisional
revolutionary government?


On this question the opportunists of present-day Social-Democracy, viz., the
new-Iskrists, are dragging the Party back just as strenuously as the
Rabocheye Dyelo-ists did five years ago on the question of political
struggle in general. Their reactionary views on this point are fully
elaborated in Martynov’s pamphlet Two Dictatorships, which
Iskra,
No. 84, approved and recommended in a special re view, and to which we have
repeatedly called our readers’ attention.


At the outset of his pamphlet Martynov tries to frighten us with the following
grim prospect: If a strong, revolutionary Social-Democratic organisation could
“time and carry out the general armed uprising of the people”
against the autocracy, as Lenin dreamed, “is it not obvious that the
general will of the people would on the morrow after the revolution

    

 designate precisely this party as the provisional government? Is it not
obvious that the people would entrust the immediate fate of the revolution
precisely to this party, and to no other?”


This is incredible, but true. The future historian of Russian Social-Democracy
will have to record with surprise that at the very outset of the Russian
revolution the Girondists of Social-Democracy tried to frighten the
revolutionary proletariat with such a prospect! Martynov’s pamphlet (as well as
a host of articles and passages in the new Iskra) is nothing but an
attempt to daub the “horrors” of such a prospect. The ideological
leader of the new-Iskrists is haunted by fear of “a seizure of
power”, by the bogy of “Jacobinism”, of Bakuninism,
of Tkachovism,[1]

and of all the other

dreadful isms

with which old
wives on the fringe of the revolution are so eager to scare political
infants. Naturally, this is done not without “quoting” Marx and
Engels. Poor Marx and poor Engels, what abuses their works have suffered through
quotations! You remember how the maxim “Every class struggle
is
a political struggle”[2]

was invoked to justify the
narrowness and backwardness of our political tasks and methods of
political agitation and struggle? Now it is Engels who is made to give false
evidence in favour of tail-ism. In The Peasant War in Germany, he
wrote: “The worst thing that can befall a leader of an extreme party is to
be compelled to take over a government in an epoch when the movement is not yet
ripe for the domination of the class which he represents, and for the
realisation of the measures which that domination requires.” One has only to
read carefully this opening of the lengthy passage which Martynov quotes to see
plainly how our tail-ender distorts the author’s meaning. Engels speaks of a
government that is required for the domination of a class. Is this not
obvious? Applied to the proletariat, it consequently means a government
that is required for the domination of the proletariat, i.e., the
dictatorship of the proletariat for the effectuation of the socialist
revolution. Martynov fails to understand this, and confounds the
provisional
revolutionary government in the period of the overthrow of the autocracy with
the requisite domination of the proletariat in the period of the overthrow of
the bourgeoisie; he confounds the democratic dictatorship of the

    

proletariat and the peasantry with the socialist dictatorship of the working
      class. Yet if we continue reading the quoted passage, Engels’ idea
      becomes still clearer. The leader of the extreme party, he says, will have
      to “advance the interests of an alien class, and to feed his own
      class with phrases and promises, and with the assurances that the
      interests of that alien class are its own interests. Whoever finds
    himself in this false position is irrevocably
      lost.”[3]


The underlined passages clearly show that Engels expressly warns against the
false position that results from a leader’s failure to understand the real
interests of “his own” class and the real class content of the
revolution. To make this clearer to the subtle mind of our Martynov we shall
essay a simple illustration. When the adherents of the Narodnaya Volya, in the
belief that they represented the interests of “Labour”, assured
themselves and others that 90 per cent of the peasants in the future Russian
Constituent Assembly would be socialists, they put themselves in a false
position which was bound to spell their irrevocable political doom, since these
“promises and assurances” were at variance with objective
reality. Actually they would have advanced the interests of the bourgeois
democrats, “the interests of an alien class”. Are you not beginning
to perceive a ray of light, most worthy Martynov? When the
Socialists-Revolutionaries describe the agrarian reforms that must inevitably
come about in Russia as “socialisation”, as “the transfer of
the land to the people”, as the beginning of “equality in land
tenure”, they place themselves in a false position which is bound to lead
to their irrevocable political doom, because, in practice, the very reforms for
which they strive will bring about the domination of an alien class, of
the peasant bourgeoisie, so that the more rapidly the revolution develops, the
more rapidly will their phrases, promises, and assurances be refuted by
reality. Do you still fail to see the point, most worthy Martynov? Do you still
fail to comprehend that the essence of Engels’ thought is that it is
fatal not to understand the real historical tasks of the revolution
and that Engels’ words are applicable, therefore, to the Narodnaya Volya
adherents and the “Socialists-Revolutionaries”?

Bakuninism—an anarchist trend hostile to Marxism. Named after
its founder Mikhail Bakunin (1814-76). The basic postulate of Bakuninism was the
negation of the state as such, including the dictatorship of the
proletariat. The Bakuninists held that the revolution was to take the form of
immediate popular revolts directed by a secret revolutionary society, made up of
“outstanding” individuals. The theory and the tactics of the
Bakuninists were severely condemned by Marx and Engels. Lenin described
Bakuninism as the world outlook “of tile petty bourgeois who despairs of
his salvation”. Bakuninism was one of the ideological sources of Narodism.


Tkachovism—from Tkachov, one of the ideologists of Narodism. He
ignored the role of the popular masses and advocated the idea
of a conspiratorial organisation and the tactics of individual
terrorism.

      Lenin
Social-Democracy and the Provisional Revolutionary Government



    

II

Engels points to the danger of failure on the part of the leaders of the
proletariat to understand the non-proletarian character of the
revolution, but our sage Martynov infers from this the danger that the leaders
of the proletariat, who, by their programme, their tactics (i.e., their entire
propaganda and agitation), and their organisation, have separated themselves
from the revolutionary democrats, will play a leading part in establishing the
democratic republic. Engels sees the danger in the leader’s confounding of the
pseudo-socialist with the really democratic character of the revolution, while
our sage Martynov infers from this the danger that the proletariat, together
with the peasantry, may consciously assume the dictatorship in the establishment
of the democratic republic, the last form of bourgeois domination and the best
form for the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Engels
sees the danger in the false, deceptive position of saying one thing and doing
another, of promising the domination of one class and actually ensuring that of
another. Engels sees the irrevocable political doom consequent upon such a false
position, while our sage Martynov deduces the danger that the bourgeois
adherents of democracy will not permit the proletariat and the peasantry to
secure a really democratic republic. Our sage Martynov cannot for the life of
him understand that such a doom, the doom of the leader of the
proletariat, the doom of thousands of proletarians in the struggle for a truly
democratic republic, would well be a physical doom, but not,

how ever, 

a
political doom; on the contrary, it would be a momentous political victory of
the proletariat, a momentous achievement of its hegemony in the struggle for
liberty. Engels speaks of the political doom of one who unconsciously strays
from the path of his own class to that of an alien class, while our sage
Martynov, reverently quoting Engels, speaks of the doom of one who goes further
and further along the sure road of his own class.


The difference between the point of view of revolutionary Social-Democracy and
that of tail-ism is glaringly obvious. Martynov and the new Iskra
shrink from the task which the proletariat, together with the peasantry, is
called upon

    

to shoulder—the task of the most radical democratic revolution; they
      shrink from the Social-Democratic leadership of this revolution and thus
      surrender, albeit unwittingly, the interests of the proletariat into the
      hands of the bourgeois democrats. From Marx’s correct idea that we must
      prepare, not a government party, but an opposition party of the
      future, Martynov draws the conclusion that we must form a tail-ist
    opposition to the present revolution. This is what his political
    wisdom adds up to. His line of reasoning, which we strongly advise the
    reader to ponder, is as follows:


“The proletariat cannot win political power in the state, either wholly or
in part, until it has made the socialist revolution. This is the indisputable
proposition which separates us from opportunist Jaurèsism...” (Martynov,
op. cit., p. 58)—and which, we would add, conclusively proves
that the worthy Martynov is incapable of grasping what the whole thing is
about. To confound the participation of the proletariat in a government that is
resisting the socialist revolution with its participation in the democratic
revolution is to miss the point hopelessly. It is Like confounding Millerand’s
participation in the Cabinet of the murderer Galliffet with
Varlin’s[3]

participation in the Commune, which defended and safeguarded the republic.


But listen further, and see what a tangle our author gets himself into:
“But that being the case, it is evident that the coming revolution cannot
realise any political forms against the will of the whole bourgeoisie,
for the latter will be the master tomorrow...” (Martynov’s italics). In the
first place, why are only political forms mentioned here, when the
previous sentence referred to the power of the proletariat in general,
even to the extent of
the socialist revolution? Why does not the author speak of realising economic
forms? Because, without noticing it, he has already leaped from the socialist to
the democratic revolution. Secondly, that being the case, the author is
absolutely wrong in speaking tout court (bluntly) of “the will of
the whole bourgeoisie”, because the very thing that distinguishes the
epoch of democratic revolution is the diversity of wills of the various strata
of the bourgeoisie which is just emancipating itself from absolutism. To speak
of the democratic revolution and confine oneself to a bald

    

contrast of “proletariat” and “bourgeoisie” is sheer
nonsense, for that revolution marks the period in the development of
society in which the mass of society virtually stands between the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie and constitutes an immense petty-bourgeois, peasant
stratum. For the very reason that the democratic revolution has not yet been
consummated, this immense stratum has far more interests in common with the
“proletariat” in the matter of realising political forms than has
the “bourgeoisie” in the real and strict sense of the word. Failure
to understand this simple thing is one of the main sources of Martynov’s muddle.


Further: “That being the case, the revolutionary struggle of the
proletariat, by simply frightening the majority of the bourgeois elements, can
have but one result—the restoration of absolutism in its original form
... and, of course, the proletariat will not halt before this possible
result; at the worst, if things tend decidedly towards a revival and
strengthening of the decaying autocratic regime by means of a
pseudo-constitutional concession, it will not hold back from
frightening the
bourgeoisie. In entering the struggle, however, the proletariat obviously does
not have this ’worst’ in view.”


Can you make anything of this, dear reader? The proletariat will not hold back
from frightening the bourgeoisie, which course will lead to the restoration of
absolutism, if there should be a threat of a pseudo-constitutional concession!
This is as much as to say: I am threatened with an Egyptian plague in the form
of a one-day conversation with Martynov alone; therefore, if the worst comes to
the worst, I shall fall back on the method of intimidation, which can lead only
to a two-day conversation with Martynov and Martov. This is the sheerest
gibberish, sir!


The idea that haunted Martynov when he wrote the

non sense 

 here quoted was the
following: if in the period of the democratic revolution the proletariat uses
the threat of the socialist revolution to frighten the bourgeoisie, this can
lead only to reaction, which will also weaken the democratic gains already
won. That and nothing more. There can be no question, of course, either of
restoring absolutism in its original form or of the proletariat’s readiness, if
the worst comes to the worst, to resort to the worst kind of stupidity. The
whole

    

thing takes us back to the difference between the democratic and the socialist
      revolution, overlooked by Martynov, to the existence of that immense
      peasant and petty-bourgeois population which is capable of supporting the
      democratic revolution, but is at present incapable of supporting
      the socialist revolution.


Let us listen further to our sage Martynov: “Evidently, the struggle
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the eve of the bourgeois
revolution must differ in some respects from the same struggle at its
concluding stage, on the eve of the socialist revolution....” Yes, this is
evident; and if Martynov had paused to think what this difference actually is,
he would hardly have written the above-given drivel, or, indeed, his while
pamphlet.


“The struggle to influence the course and outcome of the bourgeois
revolution can find expression only in the exertion of revolutionary pressure
by the proletariat on the will of the liberal and radical bourgeoisie, and in
the compulsion on the part of the more democratic ’lower strata’ of society to
bring the ’upper strata’ into agreement to carry through the bourgeois
revolution to its logical conclusion. The struggle will find expression in the
fact that the proletariat will at every opportunity confront the bourgeoisie
with the dilemma—either backward, into the strangling grip of
absolutism, or forward, with the people.”


This tirade is the central point of Martynov’s pamphlet. We have here its sum
and substance, all its fundamental “ideas”. And what do all these
clever ideas turn out to be? Who are these “lower strata” of
society, the “people” of whom our sage has at last bethought
himself? They are precisely that multitudinous petty-bourgeois stratum of town
and village which is quite capable of functioning in a revolutionary
democratic capacity. And what is this pressure that the proletariat
and the peasantry can exert on the upper social strata, what is meant by the
proletariat advancing together with the people in despite of the upper social
strata? It is that same revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of
the proletariat and the peasantry against which our tail-ender is
declaiming! Only
he is afraid to think to the end, to call a spade a spade. And so he utters
words whose meaning he

    

does not understand. in ludicrous, florid

      language,[1]

he timidly repeats
slogans, the true significance of which escapes him. None but a tail-ender could
deliver himself of such a curio in the most “interesting” part of
his summary as: revolutionary pressure of the proletariat and the
“people” on the upper strata of society, but without a
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the
peasantry. Only a Martynov could show himself so adept! Martynov wants the
proletariat to threaten the upper strata of society that it will go forward with
the people, while at the same time firmly deciding with its new-Iskra
leaders not to go for ward along the democratic path, because that is
the path of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship. Martynov wants the
proletariat to exert pressure on the will of the up per strata by displaying its
own lack of will. Martynov wants the proletariat to bring the upper strata
“into agreement” to carry the bourgeois revolution through to its
logical, democratic-republican conclusion, but to do so by expressing its own
fear of assuming, jointly with the people, the task of carrying the
revolution through, its fear of taking power and forming the democratic
dictatorship. Martynov wants the proletariat to be the vanguard in the
democratic revolution and therefore our sage Martynov
frightens the proletariat with the perspective of participation in the
provisional revolutionary government in the event of the success of the
insurrection!


Reactionary tail-ism could go no further. We should all prostrate ourselves
before Martynov, as we would before a saint, for having developed the tail-ist
tendencies of the new Iskra to their logical conclusion and for having
given them emphatic and systematic expression with regard to the most pressing
and basic political

     questions.[2]

What is Martynov’s muddle-headedness due to? To the fact that he confounds
democratic revolution with socialist revolution; that he overlooks the role of
the intermediate stratum of the people lying between the
“bourgeoisie” and the “proletariat” (the petty-bourgeois
masses of the urban and rural poor, the “semi-proletarians”, the
semi-proprietors); and that he fails to understand the true meaning of our
minimum programme. Martynov has heard that it is wrong for a socialist to
participate in a bourgeois Cabinet (when the proletariat is struggling for the
socialist revolution), and he hastens to “understand” this as
meaning that we should not participate with the revolutionary bourgeois
democrats in the democratic revolution and in the dictatorship that is
essential for the full accomplishment of such a revolution. Martynov read our
minimum programme, but he missed the fact that the strict distinction it draws
between transformations that can be carried out in a bourgeois society and
socialist transformations is not merely booklore but is of the most vital,
practical significance; he missed the fact that in a revolutionary period this
programme must be immediately tested and applied in practice. It did not occur
to him that rejecting the idea of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship in
the period of the autocracy’s downfall is tantamount to renouncing the
fulfilment of our minimum programme. Indeed, let us but consider all the
economic and political transformations formulated in that programme—the
demand for the republic, for arming the people, for the separation of the Church
from the State, for full democratic liberties, and for decisive economic
reforms. Is it not clear that these transformations cannot possibly be brought
about in a bourgeois society without the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship
of the lower classes? Is it not clear that it is not the proletariat alone, as
distinct from the “bourgeoisie”, that is referred to here, but the
“lower classes”, which are the active motive force of every
democratic revolution? These classes are the proletariat plus the
scores of millions of urban and rural poor whose conditions of existence are
petty-bourgeois. Without a doubt, very many representatives of these masses
belong to the bourgeoisie. But

    

there is still less doubt that the complete establishment of democracy is in the
interests of these masses, and that the more enlightened these masses are, the
more inevitable will be their struggle for the complete establishment of
democracy. Of course, a Social-Democrat will never forget the dual political
and economic nature of the petty-bourgeois urban and rural masses; he will never
forget the need for a separate and independent class organisation of the
proletariat, which struggles for socialism. But neither will he forget that
these masses have “a future as well as a past, judgement as well
as prejuduces”,[1]

a judgement that urges them onward towards the
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship; he will not for get that enlightenment is
not obtained from books alone, and not so much from books even as from the very
progress of the revolution, which opens the eyes of the people and gives them a
political schooling. Under such circumstances, a theory that rejects the idea of
the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship cannot be otherwise designated than as
a philosophical justification of political backwardness.


The revolutionary Social-Democrat will reject such a theory with contempt. He
will not confine himself on the eve of the revolution to pointing out what will
happen “if the worst comes to the worst”. Rather, he will also show
the possibility of a better outcome. He will dream—he is obliged to dream
if he is not a hopeless philistine—that, after the vast experience of
Europe, after the unparalleled upsurge of energy among the working class in
Russia, we shall succeed in lighting a revolutionary beacon that will illumine
more brightly than ever before the path of the unenlightened and downtrodden
masses; that we shall succeed, standing as we do on the shoulders of a number of
revolutionary gene rations of Europe, in realising all the democratic
transformations, the whole of our minimum programme, with a
thoroughness never equalled
before. We shall succeed in ensuring that the Russian revolution is not a
movement of a few months, but a movement of many years; that it leads, not
merely to a few paltry concessions from the powers that be, but to the complete
overthrow of those powers. And if we succeed in achieving this, then ... the
revolutionary conflagration will spread to Europe; the European worker,
languishing under bourgeois reaction, will rise in his turn

    

and show us “how it is done”; then the revolutionary upsurge in
Europe will have a repercussive effect upon Russia and will convert an
epoch of a few revolutionary years into an era of several revolutionary
decades; then—but we shall have ample time to say what we shall do
“then”, not from the cursed remoteness of Geneva, but at
meetings of thousands of workers in the streets of Moscow and
St. Petersburg, at the free village meetings of the Russian
“muzhiks”.

Such dreams, of course, are strange and alien to the philistines of the new
Iskra and to that “master of men’s minds”, our good
dogmatist Martynov. They fear the full achievement of our minimum programme
through the revolutionary dictatorship of the simple, common people. They are
afraid for their own political consciousness, afraid of losing the book
knowledge they have learned by rote (but not assimilated), afraid that they may
not be able to distinguish the correct and bold steps of the
democratic transformations from the adventurous leaps of non-class,
Narodnik socialism or of
anarchism. Their philistine souls warn them with good reason that in a rapid
onward march it is more difficult to distinguish the right path and quickly to
solve the new and complex problems than in the routine of small-scale, everyday
work; therefore, they mutter instinctively:
Away, away! Let this cup of revolutionary-democratic dictatorship pass from me!
It’s as much as our life is worth! Gentlemen, better “go slow, with timid
zigzags”.


Small wonder that Parvus, who had so generously supported the new-Iskrists as
long as it was a question chiefly of co-opting the most venerable and the most
deserving, finally began to feel very uncomfortable in this stagnant company. Small wonder, too, that he began more and more to feel the taedium
vitae, life weariness, in this company. In the end he rebelled. He did not
stop at defending the slogan “Organise the revolution”, which had
frightened the new Iskra to death; he did not limit himself to writing
manifestos, which Iskra published as separate leaflets, carefully
avoiding all mention of the name of the Social-Democratic

    

Labour Party in view of the “Jacobin”

       horrors.[1]

No, having freed
himself from the nightmare of the profound organisation-as-process theory
advanced by Axelrod (or was it Luxemburg?), Parvus managed at last to go
forward, in stead of moving backward like a crab. He refused to
perform the Sisyphean labour[2]

of endlessly correcting Martynov ’s and Martov’s
follies. He openly advocated (unfortunately, together with the windbag Trotsky
in a foreword to the latter’s bombastic pamphlet Before the Ninth of
January) the idea of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship, the idea
that it was the duty of Social-Democrats to take part in the provisional
revolutionary government after the overthrow of the autocracy. Parvus is
profoundly right in saying that the Social-Democrats must not fear to take bold
strides forward, to deal joint “blows” at the enemy, shoulder to
shoulder with the revolutionary bourgeois democrats, on the definite
understanding, however (very appropriately brought to mind), that the
organisations are not to be merged, that we march separately but strike
together, that we do not conceal the diversity of interests, that we watch our
ally as we would our enemy, etc.


But for all our warm sympathy for these slogans of a revolutionary
Social-Democrat who has turned away from the tail-enders, we could not help
feeling jarred by certain false notes that Parvus struck. We mention these
slight errors, not out of captiousness, but because from him to whom much is
given, much is demanded. It would be most dangerous at present for Parvus to
compromise his correct position by his own imprudence. Among the least imprudent
is the following sentence in his preface to Trotsky’s pamphlet: “If we
wish to keep the revolutionary proletariat apart from the other political
currents, we must learn to stand ideologically at the head of the revolutionary
movement [this is correct], to be more revolutionary than anyone else.” This is
incorrect. That is to say, it is incorrect, if the statement is taken in the
general sense in which it is expressed by Parvus;

    

it is incorrect from the point of view of the reader to whom this preface is
      something standing by itself, apart from Martynov and the new-Iskrists,
      whom Parvus does not mention. If we examine this statement dialectically,
      i.e., relatively, concretely, in all its aspects, and not after the manner
      of those literary jockeys, who, even many years after, snatch separate
      sentences from some single work and distort their meaning, it will become
      clear that Parvus directs the assertion expressly against tail-ism,
    to which extent he is right (compare particularly his subsequent
    words: “If we lag behind revolutionary development”,
    etc.). But the reader cannot have in mind only tail-enders, since there are
    others besides tail-enders among the dangerous friends of the revolution in
    the camp of the revolutionaries—there are the
      “Socialists-Revolutionaries”; there are people like
      the Nadezhdins, who are
    swept along by the tide of events and are helpless in the face of
    revolutionary phrases; or those who are guided by instinct rather than by a
    revolutionary outlook (like Gapon). These Parvus forgot; he forgot them
    because his presentation, the development of his thoughts, was not free, but
    was hampered by the pleasant memory of the very Martynovism against which he
    seeks to warn the reader. Parvus’ exposition is not sufficiently concrete
    because he does not consider the totality of the various revolutionary cur
    rents in Russia, which are inevitable in the epoch of democratic revolution
    and which naturally reflect the still unstratified classes of society in
    such an epoch. At such a time, revolutionary-democratic programmes are quite
    naturally veiled in vague, even reactionary, socialist ideas concealed
    behind revolutionary phrases (to wit, the Socialists-Revolutionaries and
    Nadezhdin, who, it seems, changed only his label when he went over from the
    “revolutionary socialists” to the new Iskra). Under
    such circumstances we, the Social-Democrats, never can and never will
    advance the slogan “Be more revolutionary than anyone else”. We
    shall not even try to keep up with the revolutionariness of a democrat who
    is detached from his class basis, who has a weakness for fine phrases and
    flaunts catchwords and cheap slogans (especially in agrarian matters). On
    the contrary, we will always be critical of such revolutionariness; we will
    expose the real meaning of words, the real content of idealised great
    events;

    

and we will teach the need for a sober evaluation of the classes and shadings
within the classes, even in the hottest situations of the revolution.


Equally incorrect, for the same reason, are Parvus’ statements that “the
revolutionary provisional government in Russia will be a government of
working-class democracy”, that “if the Social-Democrats are at the
head of the revolutionary movement of the Russian proletariat, this government
will be a Social-Democratic government”, that the Social-Democratic
provisional government “will be an integral government with a
Social-Democratic majority”. This is impossible, unless we speak
of fortuitous, transient episodes, and not of a revolutionary dictatorship that
will be at all durable and capable of leaving its mark in history. This is
impossible, because only a revolutionary dictatorship supported by the vast
majority of the people can be at all durable (not absolutely, of course, but
relatively). The Russian proletariat, however, is at present a minority of the
population in Russia. It can become the great, overwhelming majority only if
it combines with the mass of semi-proletarians, semi-proprietors, i.e., with the
mass of the petty-bourgeois urban and rural poor. Such a composition of the
social basis of the possible and desirable revolutionary-democratic
dictatorship will, of course, affect the composition of the revolutionary
government and inevitably lead to the participation, or even predominance,
within it of the most heterogeneous representatives of revolutionary
democracy. It would be extremely harmful to entertain any illusions on this
score. If that windbag Trotsky now writes (unfortunately, side by side with
Parvus) that “a Father Gapon could appear only once”, that
“there is no room for a second Gapon”, he does so simply because he
is a windbag. If there were no room in Russia for a second Gapon, there would be
no room for a truly “great”, consummated democratic revolution. To
become great, to evoke 1789-93, not 1848-50, and to surpass those years, it must
rouse the vast masses to active life, to heroic efforts, to “fundamental
historic creativeness”; it must raise them out of frightful
ignorance, unparalleled oppression, incredible backwardness, and
abysmal dullness. The
revolution is already raising them and will raise them completely; the
government itself is facilitating

    

the process by its desperate resistance. But, of course, there can be no
      question of a mature political consciousness, of a Social-Democratic
      consciousness of these masses or their numerous “native”
      popular leaders or even “muzhik” leaders. They cannot become
      Social-Democrats at once without first passing a number of revolutionary
      tests, not only because of their ignorance (revolution, we repeat,
      enlightens with marvellous speed), but because their class position is not
      proletarian, because the objective logic of historical development
      confronts them at the present time with the tasks, not of a socialist, but
      of a democratic revolution.


In this revolution, the revolutionary proletariat will participate with the
utmost energy, sweeping aside the

miser able 

 tail-ism of some and the
revolutionary phrases of others. It will bring class definiteness and
consciousness into the dizzying whirlwind of events, and march on intrepidly and
unswervingly, not fearing, but fervently desiring, the revolutionary-democratic
dictatorship, fighting for the republic and for complete republican liberties,
fighting for substantial economic reforms, in order to create for
itself a truly large arena, an arena worthy of the twentieth century,
in which to carry on
the struggle for socialism.

The question of the participation of Social-Democracy in the provisional
revolutionary government has been high-lighted less by the course of events than
by the theoretical reasonings of Social-Democrats of a certain trend. We dealt
in two articles (issues Nos. 13 and 14) with the arguments of Martynov, who was
the first to bring up this question. It appears, however, that the interest in
the question is so keen and the misconceptions to which the afore-mentioned
arguments have given rise (see in particular Iskra, No. 93) are so
great that it is necessary to go into this matter once more. However
Social-Democrats may assess the probability of our having to give more than a
theoretical answer to this question in the near future, the Party at any rate
must be clear as to its immediate aims. Unless there is clarity in this matter
there can no longer be any consistent propaganda and agitation free from
vacillations and mental reservations.


Let us try to reconstruct the essence of the controversial question.If what we
want is not only concessions from the autocracy but its actual overthrow, we
must work to replace the tsarist government by a provisional revolutionary
government, which would, on the one hand, convene a Constituent Assembly on the
basis of really universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot, and, on
the other, be in a position to ensure real and complete freedom during the
elections. Thus, the question arises whether it is right for the
Social-Democratic Labour Party to participate in such a provisional
revolutionary government. This question was first raised by spokesmen of the
opportunist wing of

    

our Party, specifically by Martynov, prior to the Ninth of January, when he, and
      with him Iskra, answered it in the negative. Martynov sought to
    carry the conceptions of the revolutionary Social-Democrats to an absurdity;
    he frightened them by saying that in the event of a successful out
    come to our work of organising the revolution, with our Party’s assumption
    of leadership of the popular armed uprising, we would have to
    participate in the provisional revolutionary government. This participation
    would mean inadmissible “seizure of power”, it would be
    “crass Jaurèsism”, which no class-conscious Social-Democratic
    Party could tolerate.


Let us dwell on the contentions of those who hold to such a point of view. By
participating in the provisional government, we are told, Social-Democracy
would have the power in its hands; but as the party of the proletariat,
Social-Democracy cannot hold the power without attempting to put our maximum
programme into effect, i.e., without attempting to bring about the socialist
revolution. In such an undertaking it would, at the present time, inevitably
come to grief, discredit itself, and play into the hands of the
reactionaries. Hence, participation by Social-Democrats in a provisional
revolutionary government is inadmissible.


This argument is based on a misconception; it confounds the democratic
revolution with the socialist revolution, the struggle for the republic
(including our entire minimum programme) with the struggle for socialism. If
Social-Democracy sought to make the socialist revolution its immediate aim, it
would assuredly discredit itself. It is precisely such vague and hazy ideas of
our “Socialists—Revolutionaries” that Social-Democracy has always
combated. For this reason Social-Democracy has constantly stressed the
bourgeois nature of the impending revolution in Russia and insisted on a clear
line of demarcation between the democratic minimum programme and the socialist
maximum programme. Some Social-Democrats, who are inclined to yield to
spontaneity, might forget all this in time of revolution, but not the Party as a
whole. The adherents of this erroneous view make an idol of spontaneity in their
belief that the march of events will compel the Social-Democratic Party in such
a position to set about achieving the socialist revolution, despite itself. Were
this so, our programme would be incorrect, it would

    

not be in keeping with the “march of events”, which is exactly what
      the spontaneity worshippers fear; they fear for the correctness of our
      programme. But this fear (a psychological explanation of which we
      attempted to give in our articles) is entirely baseless. Our programme is
      correct. And the march of events will assuredly confirm this more and more
      fully as time goes on. It is the march of events that will
      “impose” upon us the imperative necessity of waging a furious
      struggle for the republic and, in practice, guide our forces, the forces
      of the politically active proletariat, in this direction. It is the march
      of events that will, in the democratic revolution, inevitably impose upon
      us such a host of allies from among the petty bourgeoisie and the
      peasantry, whose real needs will demand the implementation of our minimum
      programme, that any concern over too rapid a transition to the maximum
      programme is simply absurd.


On the other hand, however, these very allies from among the petty-bourgeois
democrats create in the minds of Social-Democrats of a certain trend new
misgivings, namely, fear of “crass Jaurèsism”. Participation in a
government with the bourgeois democrats has been banned by a resolution of the
Amsterdam Congress[3];

 it is Jaurèsism, i.e., unconscious betrayal of the
interests of the proletariat, the reduction of the proletariat to a hanger-on of
the bourgeoisie, its corruption with the illusion of power, which in reality is
completely unattainable in bourgeois society.


That reasoning is no less fallacious. It shows that those who resort to it have
memorised good resolutions without understanding their meaning; they have
learned a few anti-Jaurèsist catchwords by rote, but have not
duly weighed them
and thus misapply them; they have learned the letter but not the spirit of the
recent lessons of international revolutionary Social-Democracy. To judge
Jaurèsism from the point of view of dialectical materialism one must draw a
clear line between subjective motives and objective historical
conditions. Subjectively, Jaurès wanted to save the republic by
entering into an
alliance with the bourgeois democrats. The objective conditions of this
“experiment” were that the republic in France had become an
established fact and was in no grave danger; that the working class had every
opportunity of developing an independent class

    

political organisation but did not take full advantage of this opportunity,
      partly because it was influenced by the parliamentary humbug of its
      leaders; that in actual practice, history was already objectively posing
      before the working class the tasks of the socialist revolution, from
      which the Millerands were luring the proletariat with
    promises of paltry social reforms.


Now to take Russia. Subjectively, revolutionary Social-Democrats like the
Vperyod-ists or Parvus want to secure the republic by entering into an
alliance with the revolutionary bourgeois democrats. The objective conditions
differ from those in France as night differs from day. Objectively, the
historical course of events has now posed before the Russian proletariat
precisely the task of carrying through the democratic bourgeois revolution (the
whole content of which, for brevity’s sake, we sum up in the word Republic);
this task

con fronts 

the people as a whole, viz., the entire mass of the petty
bourgeoisie and the peasantry; without such a revolution the more or less
extensive development of an independent class organisation for the socialist
revolution is unthinkable.


Try to visualise concretely this complete difference in the objective conditions
and then tell us: what is one to think of people who, carried away by the
similitude of certain words, by the resemblance between certain letters, and by
the sameness of subjective motives, forget this difference?


Because in France Jaurès paid homage to bourgeois social reform
on the mistaken
subjective plea of defending the re public, we Russian Social-Democrats are to
abandon all serious struggle to win the republic! This exactly is what the
profound wisdom of the new-Iskrists amounts to.


Indeed, is it not clear that as far as the proletariat is concerned the
struggle for the republic is inconceivable without an alliance with the
petty-bourgeois masses? Is it not clear that without the revolutionary
dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry there is not a shadow of hope
for the success of this struggle? One of the chief flaws in the argument under
discussion is its deadness, its stereotyped character, its failure to make
allowance for the revolutionary situation. Struggling for the republic while at
the same time renouncing the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship is as though
Oyama had decided to fight Kuropatkin at Mukden, but

    

disavowed beforehand any intention of taking the city. If we, the revolutionary
people, viz., the proletariat and the peasantry, want to “fight
together” against the autocracy, we must fight against it together to the
last, finish it off together, and stand together in repelling the inevitable
attempts to restore it! (It should be said again, to avoid possible
misunderstanding, that by the republic we understand not only and not
so much a form
of government as the sum-total of democratic changes envisaged in our minimum
programme.) One must have a schoolboy’s conception of history to imagine the
thing without “leaps”, to see it as something in the shape of a
straight line moving slowly and steadily upwards: first, it will be the turn of
the liberal big bourgeoisie—minor concessions from the autocracy; then of
the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie—the democratic republic; and finally
of the proletariat— the socialist revolution. That picture, by and large,
is correct,

correct d la 

longue, as the French say—spread over a
century or so (in France, for instance, from 1789 to 1905); but one must be a
virtuoso of philistinism to take this as a pattern for one’s plan of action in a
revolutionary epoch. If the Russian autocracy, even at this stage, fails to find
a way out by buying itself off with a meagre constitution, if it is not only
shaken but actually overthrown, then, obviously, a tremendous exertion
of revolutionary energy on the part of all progressive classes will be called
for to defend this gain. This “defence”, however, is nothing else
than the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry! The
more we gain now and the more vigorously we defend the gains, the less will the
inevitable future reaction be able to reappropriate afterwards, the shorter
will the intervals of reaction be, and the easier will the task be for the
proletarian fighters who will come after us.


But here come those who, yardstick in hand, d la

      Ilovaisky,[1]

would
measure off in advance, before the struggle has begun, a modest little bit of
our future conquests—people who, before the downfall of the autocracy,
even before the events of the Ninth of January, took it into their heads to
intimidate the working class of Russia with the bogy of

    

a terrible revolutionary-democratic dictatorship! And these knights of the
      yardstick lay claim to the name of revolutionary Social-Democrats....


Participation in the provisional government with the bourgeois revolutionary
democrats, they weep, means sanctioning the bourgeois order; it means
sanctioning the perpetuation of prisons and the police, of unemployment and
poverty, of private property and prostitution. This is an argument worthy either
of anarchists or of Narodniks. Social-Democrats do not hold back from struggle
for political freedom on the grounds that it is bourgeois political
freedom. Social-Democrats regard this “sanctioning” of the
bourgeois order from
the historical point of view. When Feuerbach was asked whether he sanctioned the
materialism of Büchner, Vogt, and Moleschott, he said: Backwards I fully agree
with the materialists; but not forwards. That is precisely how Social-Democrats
sanction the bourgeois system. They have never been afraid of saying, and never
will be, that they sanction the republican-democratic bourgeois order
in preference to an autocratic serf-owning bourgeois order. But they
“sanction” the bourgeois republic only because it is the last form
of class rule, because it offers a most convenient arena for the struggle of the
proletariat against the bourgeoisie; they sanction it, not for its prisons and
police, its private property and prostitution,

hut for 

 the scope and freedom it
allows to combat these charming institutions.


Far be it from us to contend that our participation in the revolutionary
provisional government entails no dangers for Social-Democracy. There is not,
nor can there be, any form of struggle, any political situation that
does not involve dangers. If there is no revolutionary class instinct,
if there is no
integral world outlook on a scientific level, if (with due apologies to our
friends of the new Iskra) there are no brains in the head, then it is
dangerous even to take part in strikes—it may lead to Economism; to engage
in parliamentary struggle—it may end in parliamentary
cretinism[4];

to support the Zemstvo liberal democrats—it may lead to a “plan for
a Zemstvo campaign”. It would then be dangerous even to read the
extremely useful writings of Jaurès and Aulard on the French
Revolution—it
may lead to Martynov’s pamphlet on two dictatorships.

 

It goes without saying that if the Social-Democrats were to forget, even for a
moment the class distinctiveness of the proletariat vis-à-vis the petty
bourgeoisie, if they were to form an ill-timed and unprofitable alliance with
one or another untrustworthy petty-bourgeois party of the intelligentsia, if
the Social-Democrats were to lose sight, even for a moment, of their own
independent aims and the need (in all political situations and exigencies, in
all political crises and upheavals) for attaching paramount importance to developing the class-consciousness of the proletariat and its in dependent political
organisation, then participation in the provisional revolutionary government
would be extremely dangerous. But under such circumstances, any political step,
we repeat, would be equally dangerous. The groundlessness of these possible
apprehensions as applied to the present formulation of the immediate tasks of
the revolutionary Social-Democrats is borne out by a few simple statements of
fact. We shall not speak about ourselves or quote the numerous declarations,
warnings, and counsels on this question given in Vperyod; we shall,
instead, cite Parvus. He sub scribes to the opinion that the Social-Democrats
should participate in the provisional revolutionary government, and he is
emphatic on the conditions, which we must never forget, namely, to strike
together, but to march separately, not to merge organisations, to watch our ally
as we would our enemy, etc. We shall not dwell in detail on this aspect of the
question, having dealt with it in our previous article.


No, the real political danger to Social-Democracy today does not lie where the
new-Iskrists are looking for it. It is not the thought of the
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry that
should fright en us, but rather the spirit of tail-ism and torpidity which has
such a demoralising effect on the party of the proletariat and finds expression
in all kinds of organisation-as-process, arming-as-process theories, and what
not. To take, for in stance, Iskra’s latest attempt to set up a
distinction between the provisional revolutionary government and the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. Is this
not an example of lifeless scholasticism? People who invent such distinctions
are capable of stringing together fine words but are absolutely incapable of
thinking.

    

Actually, these concepts stand to each other roughly in the relation of legal
      form to class content. To speak of the “provisional revolutionary
      government” is to stress the constitutional aspect of the case, the
      fact that the government originates, not from the law, but from the
      revolution, that it is a temporary government committed to the
      future Constituent Assembly. But whatever the form, whatever the
      origin, whatever
      the conditions, one thing at any rate is clear— that the provisional
      revolutionary government must have the support of definite classes. One
      has only to remember this simple truth to realise that the provisional
      revolutionary government can be nothing else but the
      revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat and the
      peasantry. Therefore, Iskra’s
    distinction only drags the Party back to fruitless disputes, away from the
    task of making a concrete analysis of the class interests in the Russian
    revolution.


Or, to take another Iskra argument. The slogan “Long Live the
Revolutionary Provisional Government!” draws from that paper the didactic
remark: “The combination of the words ’long live’ and ’government’ sullies
the lips.” What is this, if not sheer bombast? They talk about over throwing the
autocracy and yet fear to sully themselves by acclaiming the revolutionary
government! Surprisingly, they are not afraid of sullying themselves by
acclaiming a republic, for a republic necessarily implies a government,
and—no Social-Democrat ever doubted it—a bourgeois government at
that. In what way, then, does acclaiming the provisional revolutionary
government differ from acclaiming the democratic republic? Must
Social-Democracy, the political leader of the most revolutionary class, take
after an anaemic and hysterical old maid who finically insists on a fig-leaf?
Is it right to acclaim what the bourgeois-democratic government stands for, but
wrong directly to acclaim the provisional revolutionary-democratic government?


Picture it: the uprising of the workers in St. Petersburg has been victorious;
the autocracy is overthrown; the provisional revolutionary government has been
proclaimed; the armed workers jubilate, with outcries of “Long Live the
Provisional Revolutionary Government!” The new-Iskrists stand on the side
lines, their innocent eyes raised heavenward, solemnly uttering as they beat
their chaste breasts:

    

“We thank Thee, 0 Lord, that we are not like these wretches and have not
sullied our lips with such word combinations ...."


No, comrades, a thousand times no! Have no fear of sullying yourselves by most
energetic halting-at-nothing participation in a republican revolution together
with the revolutionary bourgeois democrats. Do not exaggerate the dangers of
such participation; our organised proletariat is quite capable of coping with
them. More will be accomplished in months of the revolutionary dictatorship of
the proletariat and the peasantry than in decades of the peaceful, stupefying
atmosphere of political stagnation. If, after the Ninth of January, the Russian
working class, under conditions of political slavery, was able to mobilise over
a million proletarians for staunch, disciplined, collective action, then, given
the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship, we will mobilise scores of millions
of the urban and rural poor, and we will make the Russian political revolution
the prelude to the socialist revolution in Europe.

Under this headline the German Social-Democratic news paper Vorwärts
recently published an extremely valuable document—the original text of a
letter written by M. Jules Gouin, the manager of a large machine works in
Batignolles (a suburb of Paris), to a ministry official in St. Peters
burg. Through the medium of this gentleman the French works received an order
for 114 locomotives. The total value of the order (at 27,700 francs per
locomotive) is some 3,000,000 francs, or about 1,200,000 rubles. For his good
offices in this transaction the honourable ministerial official (who, we may
add, probably occupies a fairly high post) receives for a start, as we see from
the letter, two per cent of the purchase price. This amounts to about 25,000
rubles. It further appears from the letter (which we do not quote in full for
lack of space) that of this sum 13,000 francs have already been received by the
go-between; the rest is payable in instalments. Moreover, alterations in the
standard type of locomotives to the specifications of the Russian railways are
to be paid for separately. The St. Petersburg representative of the Paris firm
undertakes to inform this official in advance what this extra charge demanded by
the works will amount to. If the official can “get” from the Russian Government a higher price than that fixed by the works, the difference too
will be placed to his credit as the “go between”. In the German
translation of the letter (written in French) this is called

Vermittlungsgeb¨hr, 

“broker’s commission”. Actually, of
course, this expression is merely a veil to cover a most brazen swindle, an
embezzlement of public funds, committed by a French capitalist and a Russian
ministry official working under a collusive contract.

 

Vorwärts rightly says that the letter casts a lurid light on Russian
venality and the advantage that foreign capital takes of it. The letter is
documentary proof of the usual “business” practices prevailing in
civilised, capitalist countries. These things are done everywhere in Europe,
too, but no where in such a shameless manner as in Russia; and nowhere is there
such “political safety” (safety from exposure) for corruption as in
autocratic Russia. No wonder, conclude the German Social-Democrats, that
European industry is interested in preserving the Russian autocracy with its
irresponsible officials and their shady practices. No wonder Russian officials
fight tooth and nail against a constitution that threatens to establish public
control over the administration. One can gather from this exposure what the
Russian officialdom is “making” on the war with Japan, what sums
have found their way into the pockets of officials employed in the
St. Petersburg ministries from, say, the sale of German marine shipping to
Russia! The national calamity is a gold mine for the war contractors and venal
officials.

Iskra, No. 92, contains an article “The
Zigzags of a Firm Course”, purporting to show that, in reality,
Vperyod is not at all maintaining the principles and the line of
the old Iskra firmly and consistently, but, on the contrary, is
zigzagging in the wake of the new Iskra. Strictly speaking, this
allegation is too ludicrous to merit serious consideration. What strikes us
here is not the content of the new Iskra polemic, for it has no
content, but its methods. These methods are worth considering; upon
examination they reveal that there are polemics and polemics. The old
Iskra was disliked for its polemics, but no one ever thought of
calling them unprincipled. The new Iskra is despised for its
polemics, because their unprincipled nature is evident to the mass of the
Party members engaged in practical work and the consistent Rabocheye
Dyelo-ists, as well as to the “conciliators” headed by
Plekhanov.  

It is our intention to show the reader with what methods these polemics
operate.  

Let us follow Iskra step by step. Vperyod is leading
the Party towards a split, it says. This is not true. All who have studied
the Party crisis, not from old wives’ tales, but from documents, know that
it was the Minority that split the Party immediately after the Second
Congress, and that it did so clandestinely by setting up a secret
organisation. Iskra is engaging in hypocrisy now and is
misrepresenting the facts. An open split may evoke hatred, but a secret
split can evoke only contempt. Vperyod wants no secret split; that
is all there is to it.  
 

Further, they want to charge us with contradicting

our selves 

on the question of autonomy and centralism. Lenin, they allege, asserted in

    Steps[2]

that autonomy is a principle of opportunism, whereas now the Bureau of
Committees of the Majority itself is in favour of the broadest possible
autonomy for the local committees. Lenin maintained that bureaucracy stands
in the same relation to democracy as the organisational principle of
revolutionary Social-Democracy to the organisational principle of the
opportunists, whereas now the Bureau of Committees of the Majority itself
complains of bureaucracy. This is the substance of their accusation against
us. This charge too is built on downright false hood. In Steps
(and, before Steps, in his “Letter to

   Iskra”[3]

),

Lenin cautioned; declared, reiterated, and emphasised countless times that
the phrases used against bureaucracy, for autonomy, etc., were extremely
vague, that they were open to any number of different constructions and
could be made to mean almost anything. Lenin declared hundreds of times
that, in substance, these phrases were used exclusively to veil the desire
for co-optation. These words of Lenin have now been fully borne out by the
most authentic documentary evidence. If, however, we take these words in
the sense of principle, said Lenin (if we take!), we shall find
the following: Bureaucracy, taken in general, may denote officialism, red
tape, formalism, paper answers. This sort of bureaucracy is evil, said
Lenin, illustrating his remarks with Martov’s well-known draft of the
Rules. It is clear to every reader who is at all conscientious that this is
the kind of bureaucracy meant by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority,
so that to accuse Vperyod of contradicting itself is utter
childishness. Bureaucracy may mean infringement of the legitimate and, if
we may say so, of the “natural” rights of every opposition, a
fight waged against a minority by unfair means. Such bureaucracy is
possible, said Lenin, but there is no principle involved in it. It must be
combated by the establishment of constitutional guarantees of the rights of
minorities. Such guarantees

    

were proposed clearly, frankly, and openly for the first time by the
      Stone-Hards, or Vperyod-ists, as they are now called, in the
    well-known Declaration of the

     Twenty-Two,[4]

 which was issued in August, seven
    months ago, without having since evoked the slightest attempt on the part of
    the new-Iskrists unequivocally to define their attitude to wards it.


But apart from these interpretations of bureaucracy, anti-autonomy, etc., it is
possible to have interpretations based on real principles—not in the form
of any irregularities, extremes, etc., but as general principles governing the
entire organisation. This was the interpretation the Mensheviks tried to force
upon us against our will, despite our resistance. Lenin, both in his
“Letter to Iskra” and in Steps, sounded
innumerable warnings against such an interpretation, which obscures the actual
concrete course that the crisis and the split have been taking. Lenin made a
straightforward appeal in his “Letter to Iskra”: Drop this
nonsense, gentlemen; nine-tenths of it is squabbling! Lenin was attacked for
this, and the Central Organ tried to prove that principles were involved. Well,
if that is so, Lenin replied and the Vperyod-ists always will reply,
then the principle of autonomy is really an opportunist principle for a
Social-Democratic organisation. If that is so, then your outcries against
bureaucracy are, in principle, of a piece with those of the Jaurèsists in
France, the Bernsteinians in Germany, and the reformists in Italy. That is how
the matter stands; and to prove it, one has only to study the Party crisis from
documents and not from the assurances of friends. Lenin had told the Bundist
Lieber at the Second Congress (see proceedings) that he would defend the
autonomy of “any”, even a Tula,

     Committee,[5]

against petty centralism; Lenin did not utter a word against the
guarantee of such autonomy in
Clause 8 of our Party Rules. The principle of autonomy, however, was
never defended either by Lenin or by the Bureau of Committees of the Majority;
it was defended by Akimov, by Lieber, by the new-Iskrists. It is not difficult,
of course, to confuse the issue in the

    

mind of the unenlightened reader by tearing words from their context regardless
of the circumstances under which they were used and of their original
meaning; but newspapers that employ such methods in polemics can only expect to
be treated like Novoye Vremya.[11]


Let us take the pamphlet by “A Worker”. What essentially is the
point that Iskra confuses? It is that certain unprincipled people have
only let themselves in for it with their shouting about the principle of
autonomy and the like, since the only reply could be a demand for the elective
principle. Thereupon these people began to beat a retreat The
Vperyod-ists, on the other hand, have always held that talking big and
flaunting the “principles” of autonomy and democracy is indecent;
but if the Rules require serious, practical amendments along the line of
democracy, as far as it is feasible under Russian conditions, let us discuss
them openly and above-board. Vperyod challenged “A Worker”
to produce, if he could, any passage in Social-Democratic literature where the
necessity of drawing workers into the Party committees is put as clearly as
Lenin put

 it.[6]

“A Worker”, led astray by the new-Iskrists, replied
in print that he accepted the challenge; it turned out, however, that he did not
understand what accepting the challenge implied, for he did not point out any
such passage, but only threatened to “give it” to Lenin, to
“get even” with him. Naturally, Vperyod left these terrible
threats unanswered.


Now let us take again the question of a single centre. Lenin, it is alleged,
said in Steps that it was the opportunists who stood for a single
centre, whereas now this is the position of the Bureau of Committees of the
Majority. Again the same gross distortion of facts, with an eye to the
uninformed or inattentive reader. Whoever wishes to read Steps will
find (on page 28, mention of which is so studiously avoided by the
Iskra columnist) that long before the first article written by a
Bolshevik against two centres (Ryadovoi’s articles in Our
Misunderstandings), Lenin had written that the idea of two centres
“took into account the temporary [mark this!] and special requirements of
the Russian Social-Democratic working-class movement in the

    

existing conditions of political slavery, with the initial base of operations
      for the revolutionary assault being set up abroad”. “The first
      idea,” the author of Steps goes on to say at once in regard to
    the idea of centralism in general, “as the one [!] matter of
    principle, had [according to the plan of the old Iskra] to pervade
    the entire Rules; the second, being a particular idea necessitated by
    temporary circumstances of place and mode of action, took the form of a
    seeming departure from centralism in the proposal to set up two
    centres”

       (p. 28).[7]

Now, we leave it to the reader to judge the
    methods of controversy employed by our Party’s Novoye Vremya! Iskra
    simply tries to mislead the reader by keeping back from him the
    fact

(1)
    that Lenin pointed out long ago the temporary, particular
    significance of the idea of two centres; and

(2) that, therefore, Lenin
    never explained the opportunists’ defence of a single centre by general
    principles, but only by “temporary circumstances of place and mode of
    action”, by circumstances under which the opportunist wing of the
    Party actually stood for and had to stand for a single centre. That
    the old Iskra was a bulwark in the struggle against opportunism is
    a fact. That it was the opportunist wing which constituted the minority at
    the Congress is also a fact. Why, then, should it be a matter of surprise
    that vow, when the new Iskra has turned out to be opportunist and
    when those in Russia have shown greater firmness in principle and Party
    consistency than those abroad, the “temporary circumstances”
    have changed? We should not be at all surprised now if the Rabocheye
      Dyelo-ists, Martynov, the “Marsh”, and the new-Iskrists
    all took up a stand (say, at the Third Congress) for two centres, while all
    the Bolsheviks (or nearly all) stood for one centre. It would only be a
    change, in keeping with the “temporary circumstances”, in the
    methods of struggle for the same principles of revolutionary
    Social-Democracy, the principles of the old Iskra for which Lenin
    and the Bolsheviks fought and continue to fight steadfastly. It is only
    people of the Novoye Vremya type who can see anything
    “miraculous” in such a change. (We said that nearly all
    Bolsheviks were likely to stand for one centre. We have yet to see how
    things

    

will turn out at the Third Congress. There are differences of opinion among us
as to the significance of “temporary circumstances of place and mode of
action”. We shall compare these different opinions at the Congress and
“strike a balance”.)


The new-Iskra methods of polemising would seem to have been made
sufficiently clear in the foregoing, so that we can now be more
brief. Iskra contends that the Bureau of Committees of the Majority
violated Party discipline by calling the Congress, in contravention of the
Rules, over the head of the Council. This is untrue, for the Council had broken
the Rules long before by its evasion of the Congress. We openly declared this in
the press quite some time ago (Orlovsky).[12]

After the Mensheviks had
torn the Party asunder by a secret split and dodged the Congress on all kinds of
false pretexts, we had no practical way out of the preposterous situation other
than to convene the Congress against the will of the centres. Iskra
says that the editorial in issue No. 9 of Vperyod, “New Tasks and
New Forces”, by insisting on the necessity of considerably increasing the
number of Party organisations of every description, contradicts the spirit of
Clause I of the Rules as formulated by Lenin, who, in defending his idea at the
Congress, had urged the necessity of narrowing the concept of Party. The
objection raised by Iskra can be recommended as a high-school problem
in logic to train young people in debating. The Bolsheviks have always held that
the Party should be limited to the sum-total of Party organisations and that
the number of these organisations should then be increased (see Proceedings of
the Congress and Steps, p. 40 et al., particularly pp. 40-41
and

 46).[8]

The new Iskra confounds extension of the Party’s
framework with extension of the concept of Party, it
confounds extension of the number of Party organisations with
extension of
the Party beyond the limits of the Party organisations! To explain
this perplexing riddle, we shall give a plain, easy illustration: let us assume
for the sake of simplicity an army consisting exclusively of men of a single arm
of the service; the manpower of the army must be narrowed down to a total of men
who have actually proved

    

themselves able to shoot, with none allowed to get past with general phrases or
      verbal assurances of military fitness; after that every effort must be
      made to increase the number of men who can pass the rifleman’s
      test. Aren’t you beginning to see a glimmer of light, gentlemen of the
      new Iskra?


Iskra writes, accusing Vperyod: “Previously only consistent
Social-Democrats, who had to be recognised as such, were wanted; now all sorts
of elements are admitted to the holy of holies, except those that are avowedly
non-Social-Democratic.” Take Vperyod, No. 9. There you will read:
“Let all ... circles, except those that are avowedly non Social-Democratic,
either directly join the Party or align themselves with the Party
[author’s italics]. In the latter event we must not demand that they accept our
programme or that they necessarily enter into organisational relations with

       us....”[9]

Is it not clear that Iskra is simply juggling, confounding
what was “previously needed” for joining the Party with what
“is now permitted” for aligned groups? The Bolsheviks have
constantly said, and say now in Vperyod, that self-enrolment in the
Party is intellectualist anarchism, that Party members must accept
“obligatory organisational relations” not in words alone. Only
people set on creating confusion can fail to understand this. Vperyod’s
slogan was: Organise new forces for the new tasks into Party organisations or,
at least, into organisations aligned with the Party. Iskra’s slogan is:
“Open the doors wider!” The ones say: “Take new marksmen into your
regiments, organise those who are learning to shoot into auxiliary units.” The
others say: “Open the doors wider! Let all comers enroll themselves in the
army, any way they please!”


As to the question of organising the revolution and organising the arming,
Iskra now seeks to assure us that it has no differences with
Vperyod. We would ask first of all: what about Parvus? If the
differences have merely been invented by the perfidious Vperyod, why
don’t you have it out with the new-Iskrist Parvus, who cannot be suspected of
picking on Iskra? You yourselves had to admit your disagreement with
Parvus and were the first to do so. Why then this game of

    

hide-and-seek? Essentially, the new Iskra argues here against
Vperyod in the very manner in which Rabocheye Dyelo used to
argue against the old Iskra. We cannot too strongly advise comrades
interested in the history of their own Party to reread Rabocheye
Dyelo, particularly issue No. 10. It had been pointed out to Rabocheye
Dyelo that it minimised the tasks of the political struggle. Its retort was
that Iskra under estimated the economic struggle. It is pointed out to
the new Iskra that it minimises the tasks of organising the
revolution, the conduct of the uprising and the arming of the workers,
and the
participation of Social-Democracy in the provisional revolutionary
government. The new Iskra retorts that Vperyod underestimates
the spontaneity of revolution and insurrection, the primacy of politics over
“technique” (arming). Like tail-ender views lead to like tail-ender
conclusions. These people seek to cover up their inability to provide a guiding
slogan for the new tasks by moralising on the importance of the old tasks. Words
are torn out of
context to show that the opponent himself appreciates the importance
of the old tasks, the significance of the ABC of Social-Democracy. Of
course, comrades of the new Iskra, we prize the ABC of
Social-Democracy very highly, but we do not want to remain at the
abecedarian stage forever. Let this be plain. Neither Parvus nor the
Bureau of Committees of the Majority nor Vperyod would ever think of
disputing the elementary truth that the workers themselves can, will, and must
arm, even without the organisations and the Party. But if Iskra makes
its famous “self-arming” a slogan—then, of course,
everyone smiles at the sight of such a worshipful attitude towards
spontaneity. When Iskra, correcting Parvus, discovers a new
task—worthy of the lucubrations of Krichevsky and Akimov—the task
of “arming the workers with a sense of the burning necessity to
arm”, it is only natural that it should meet with nothing but
ridicule. If at a time when the new tasks of arming the masses,
organising street
fighting, etc., have been added to the old tasks of Social-Democracy,
Iskra hastens to belittle these
tasks (which we have scarcely begun to tackle) with its disparaging
sophisms about “technique” and its secondary role; if instead of
supplementing the old, customary, constant political tasks of the Party
with the new tasks of “technique”,

    

Iskra argues about the separation of the former
    from the latter, then, of course, everyone regards such arguments as a new
    variety of tail-ism.


In conclusion, as a curiosity, we would mention Iskra’s attempt to
discard its sterling reputation as the author of the famous no-panic-mongering
theory. Iskra itself now calls this a “famous” question and
tries to prove that the Bureau of Committees of the Majority, too, advocates
“no panic mongering” when in its leaflet on the insurrection it
recommends caution in destroying property belonging to petty bourgeois (except
in cases of absolute necessity), so as not to frighten them
needlessly.[13]

“Ah,” Iskra exults, “so you, too, do not want to
frighten people!”


Isn’t this just too precious? An agreement with the Zemstvo men not to cause a
panic during a peaceful demonstration is compared to a warning against the
unwarranted destruction of property during the uprising! In the first case,
moreover, it is “demonstrations of a higher type”; in the second,
the base, contemptible “technique” of armed street fighting.... Just
one slight question, friends: why is it that every

   Social-Democrat[10]

agrees and
will agree with the advice not to frighten the petty bourgeoisie needlessly
during an uprising? And why, on the other hand, did your plan for a Zemstvo
campaign become “famous” among Social-Democrats, by your own
admission? Why did Parvus and many others from your own ranks protest against
it? Why are you yourselves to this very day ashamed to publish
this famous plan? Is it not because the advice contained in your notorious
letter was as irrelevant and ridiculous as the advice of the Bureau is
indisputably correct and generally accepted by Social-Democrats?

The legal press reported some time ago that a conference of Zemstvo leaders from
various parts of Russia had been held in Moscow. Moskovskiye
Vedomosti[2]

even sought to give the alarm, shouting that the
government was allowing revolutionary assemblies to be held in Russia, and that
it was necessary to call a congress of the monarchist party, etc.; but no one
paid serious attention to these outcries, since the police these days have their
hands full with affairs of a much more disturbing nature. By all accounts,
however, the Zemstvo men kept within the bounds of their usual constitutional
aspirations. Still, their conference proceedings were of considerable interest,
inasmuch as they comprehended the agrarian question. We quote in full the
theses which, by the press reports, were adopted by a majority of the
conference:



“1) State interference in the economic life should be extended to agrarian
relations as well.

2) Proper agrarian legislation presumes a radical change
1??].

3) The impending agrarian reform should be framed on the following
principles:

I. Improvement of the economic conditions of the farming class by
the compulsory redemption of the necessary supplementary plots from private
holdings for the benefit of the land-poor of various categories [the elaboration
of this question has been entrusted to several persons].

II. Crown lands and
some of the royal demesnes to be declared state lands; these state lands to be
increased by the purchase and redemption of privately owned land and to be
utilised for the benefit of the labouring population.

III. The conditions of
lease to be regulated through governmental intervention in the relations between
owners and tenants.

IV. The establishment of public and state mediation
commissions to enforce agrarian measures in accordance with the above-mentioned
principles.

V. The proper organisation of a widely-conceived system of migration
and settlement, better credit facilities, reform of the Peasant Bank, and
assistance to

    

co-operative enterprises. VI. The radical revision of land-surveying legislation
      with a view to simplifying, facilitating, and cheapening demarcation,
      abolishing the open-field system on privately owned lands and peasant
      allotments, making possible the exchange of lots, etc.”



Before dealing with this most instructive programme point by point, let us dwell
on its significance as a whole. Undoubtedly, the very fact that spokesmen of the
landlord class present such a programme proves more conclusively than lengthy
arguments that Russia differs substantially in some respect from all the fully
formed capitalist nations of Western Europe. In what does this difference
consist? Is it in the semi-socialist village communal system that prevails in
our country with the corresponding absence of a bourgeois intelligentsia and of
bourgeois democracy, as the old Narodnik socialists used to think and as the
“Socialists Revolutionaries” still think to some extent? Or is it in
the multitude of feudal survivals that enmesh our countryside, making it
impossible for capitalism to develop widely and freely and creating Narodnik
moods precisely in bourgeois-democratic circles? This is a question no thinking
socialist will dismiss with evasive excuses, or on the grounds that it is too
abstract and theoretical, supposedly out of place in an epoch of revolution, or
by reference to the fact of peasant uprisings as a sufficient explanation of the
landlords’ complaisance. Now, in the epoch of revolution, evasiveness or lack
of principle in theoretical questions is tantamount to utter ideological
bankruptcy; for now of all times a socialist requires a well-thought-out and
consistent world out look, so that he may control the events and not the events
him. Reference to the peasant uprisings contributes nothing either, for the
programme now adopted by the landed proprietors, who are politically organised
in Zemstvo unions, embodies the wishes which have been expressed for many a
decade by the whole liberal press and by all liberal leaders. The Narodnik
programme has become the programme of the landlords—a fact that gives a
clear political answer to the question we have raised. In a revolutionary epoch
theoretical disputes over social issues are settled by the direct action of the
diverse classes.


Let us now examine the agrarian programme of the liberals more closely. Our
legal press is inclined to sing its

    

praises. Economicheskaya Gazeta, for instance, “records the fact
that the Zemstvo people have come forward with an agrarian programme that is
incomparably more extreme [really!] than could have been expected, judging from
the prevailing impression of the composition of the Zemstvo at the present
time” (extreme, that is, from the point of view of the
landlords?). “This is evidence of the fact,” continues the article,
“that the Zemstvo political group possesses both political tact and a deep
understanding of what is taking place about us....


The tact and the understanding of the landlords consist in the fact that when
the peasants themselves began to intervene actively and definitely in agrarian
relations, these landlords began to speak of the necessity of state
interference. The same old story! State intervention in agrarian
relations has
always been a fact in Russia. When it was intervention in the interests of the
upper classes, it was called in police parlance “order”; when the
intervention comes from below, it is called “disorder”. Yes, but
what kind of intervention do the landlords want? Their programme shows that they
want intervention exclusively to regulate the relations between owners and
tenants.

ALL the 

 measures which they propose, from redemption of supplementary
plots to credit facilities and the exchange of lots, etc., apply exclusively to
those persons who use the land, i.e., the various categories of farmers. And
what of the rural labourers who have no farms of their own? As far back as the
nineties of the past century, in Russia’s fifty interior” gubernias alone
there were estimated to be no fewer than three and a half million
farm-hands and day-labourers for whom farm employment was the principal means
of earning a livelihood. Today, the number of agricultural wage-labourers is
undoubtedly still greater, and the overwhelming majority of them are entirely or
almost entirely farmless. Apart from those who possessed neither home nor farm,
it was estimated that more than three million of the approximately ten million
peasant farms in the stated gubernias possessed no horses; and that was
ten years ago. All these are farmers in name alone. Their most vital interests
lie in higher wages, shorter hours, and improved working conditions. The
landlords are discreetly silent

    

on the subject of intervention in the relations between employers and
      workers. And we may rest assured that no one will give this kind of
      intervention serious thought until the rural workers themselves intervene.


We Social-Democrats must pay most serious attention to this kind of
intervention. Both the immediate practical interests of the movement and our
general principles demand it. The bourgeois-democratic nature of Russian
liberalism and of Russian Narodism has always manifested itself, among other
things, in the fact that the interests of small farming completely overshadow
the interests of rural hired labour. Of course, convinced Narodniks, and
sometimes “Socialists-Revolutionaries”, are prone to regard this as
quite natural in view of the “secondary” role (in their
imagination, but not in actual peasant life) of hired labour, in view
of the fact
that with the further development of “village communal traditions”,
“labour views”, and “equalised tenure”, this role
might even be reduced to nought. But this tendency, however earnest,
sincere, and socialistic the justifying speeches may be, is in fact a sign of
nothing but petty-bourgeois narrow-mindedness. This sort of day dreaming, a
quality possessed by both the Russian peasant and the Russian intellectual, is
petty-bourgeois day-dreaming. The flowers of this Narodnik day-dreaming are the
same fictitious flowers that decorate one of the chains of labouring mankind,
and Social-Democratic criticism must ruthlessly pluck out such flowers,
“not that man should continue to wear his chain bereft of all joy and
pleasure, but that he should throw off the chain and reach for the
living flower.”[3]


We are in full sympathy with the peasant movement. We would consider it a
tremendous gain both for the general social development of Russia and for the
Russian proletariat if the peasantry, with our help, succeeded in wresting from
the landlords all their lands by revolutionary means. But even assuming
this most favourable outcome—even then, the mass of agricultural
hired labourers would only temporarily diminish in number but could in no event
disappear altogether. Even then, the independent interests of the rural
hired labourers would remain independent interests.


The transfer of the land to the peasants would not at all do away with the
predominance of the capitalist mode

    

of production in Russia; it would, on the contrary, provide a broader base for
its development; it would bring this development from the type approximating the
Italian closer to the American. The property distinctions among the peasants,
which are already tremendous, but relatively not very noticeable chiefly on
account of the general oppression under the absolutist serf-owning system,
would not in any way cease to exist. The expansion of the home market, the
development of exchange and commodity production on a new scale, the rapid
growth of industry and of cities— all these inevitable effects of a
substantial improvement in the condition of the peasants would unavoidably
increase property distinctions. The more illusions on that score are widespread
among us, the more energetically must the Social-Democrats combat them, if they
really want to represent the interests of the working-class movement as a
whole, and not merely of one of its

       stages.[1]


Until there has been a complete socialist revolution, not even the most radical
and most revolutionary measures for agrarian reform will eliminate the class of
agricultural wage-workers. The dream of making all people petty-bourgeois is a
reactionary platitude. For this reason we should start working now to develop
the class-consciousness of the rural wage-workers and to rally them into an
independent class organisation. The strike wave in the towns can and should
spread to the villages, not only in the form of peasant uprisings, but in the
form of real labour strikes, especially at mowing and harvesting time. The
demands contained in the working-class section of our programme, which are so
often presented by the urban workers to their employers, must, with the
corresponding changes necessitated by the different living conditions, be put
forward by the rural workers, too. We must take advantage of the fact that so
far there are no special laws in Russia degrading the position of the rural
workers below that of the urban workers (except for the law forbidding them to
leave their work without permission). We must see to it that the rising tide of
the proletarian movement creates a specifically proletarian mood and

    

proletarian methods of struggle among the farm-hands and day-labourers.


The petty-bourgeois stratum of the rural population, the peasantry in the strict
and narrow sense of the word, cannot help being revolutionary at certain periods
in history. Its present revolutionary attitude is an inevitable product of the
conditions of the “old order’, and we must vigorously support and develop
it. But it will follow just as inevitably from the conditions of the new order,
of the new, free, capitalist Russia, that part of the rural petty bourgeoisie
will side with “order”; and the more land the peasants take away
from the landlords now, the sooner this will come about. In the countryside,
too, only the rural proletariat can be a truly revolutionary class, a class
that, under all circumstances, is revolutionary to the end. The conversion of
the wretched, downtrodden muzhik into a free, energetic European farmer will be a
tremendous democratic gain; but we socialists shall not forget for a moment that
this gain will be of no real use to the cause of mankind’s complete
emancipation from all oppression unless and insofar as the farmer is
confronted by a
class-conscious, free, and organised rural proletariat.


The liberal landlords keep quiet about the rural worker. As far as the future
farmer is concerned, their sole concern is to get him converted as quickly as
possible, with the mini mum loss to their pockets (it would, perhaps, be more
correct to say with the maximum gain to their pockets), into their ally, into a
man of property, a pillar of order. What miserable sops they hope to get off
with! Their only revolutionary measure, the confiscation of the royal demesnes,
is restricted to a part of these lands; they are afraid to call
confiscation confiscation, and say nothing about the church lands. While
promising supplementary plots to the land-poor, they firmly insist on
redemption, with not a word about who should make the redemption payment. They
obviously take it for granted that the peasant will pay, as in the case of the
famed redemption of 1861. The landlords will give up their worst lands at
exorbitant prices, which is what their supplementary endowments promise. All the
measures they propose in regard to credits, co-operation, exchange of lots,
etc., are restricted entirely to narrow proprietary

    

interests. With regard to leases—one of the most acute problems of peasant
farming—t.hey offer nothing but the vaguest of
catchwords—“regulation”. This may mean any thing at all, even an
increase in rents, on the pretext of standardisation; we indicated above what
the representatives of the ruling classes have always understood by
“order”.


However, the most important and politically most dangerous feature of the
liberal programme is, in our view, the clause concerning the “public and
state mediation commissions”. The method of realising the agrarian reform
is a matter of great importance; for on the method of realisation, concretely
and actually, will depend the earnest character of the reform. In regard to this
question too (as in regard to many others), we have the Narodniks to thank when
we pay the main attention to the economic advantage, ignoring or underestimating
the political aspect of the matter. This point of view, natural in a petty
bourgeois, understandable in a farmer, is absolutely inadmissible in a
Social-Democrat. To the Social-Democrat shifts within the classes and
categories of farmers and proprietors are of no consequence unless accompanied
by a political gain that facilitates the class struggle of the proletariat. From
the point of view of petty-bourgeois day-dreaming, all schemes for
“equalised tenure”, etc., are important. From the point of view of
the Social-Democrat, all such projects are idle and harmful day-dreams that
divert the public mind from the realities of real democratic gains. The
Social-Democrats will never forget that the ruling classes always and everywhere
try to divide and corrupt the working people with economic sops. In the sphere
of agrarian reform they find this policy particularly easy and pursue it with
particular skill.


All the more definitely and emphatically must we insist on the basic
demand of our agrarian programme, namely, the establishment of revolutionary
peasant committees that will themselves enforce really radical (not in the
landlords’ sense “radical”) agrarian reforms. Short of this, every
agrarian reform will inevitably and inescapably be a new fraud, a new trap, like
the famed “Reform” of 1861. This is precisely what the “public
[?] and state mediation commissions” are—the laying of a trap! By
“public” we understand the landlords; by “state”—the
bureaucrats. “Public and state

    

commissions” means landlords’ and bureaucrats’
commissions pure and simple.


That is the point on which we must immediately focus our agitation in the
countryside. Peasants, do you hear? They want once again to load you with
benefits in true bureaucratic manner, to “regulate” your life by
landlord intervention, to “redeem” land for you on the pattern of
that old-time land redemption of dismal memory! The landlords are so kind, so
very kind: seeing that their lands are in danger of being taken away for
nothing, they magnanimously consent to sell them—at a suitable
price, of course.... Do you agree to such intervention on the part of landlords
and bureaucrats? Or do you want to intervene yourselves and build up a
life of freedom for yourselves? Then unite with the urban proletariat, fight for
the republic, arise for the insurrection which will bring you a revolutionary
government and revolutionary peasant committees!

In Vperyod,

       No. 12,[1]

there was a reference to Marx’s polemic against
Kriege on the agrarian question. The year was not 1848, as erroneously stated in
the article by Comrade —, but 1846. Hermann Kriege, a co-worker of Marx
and at the time a very young man, had gone to America in 1845 and there started
a journal, the Volkstribun, for the propaganda of communism. But he
conducted this propaganda in such a manner that Marx was obliged to protest
very strongly in the name of the German Communists against Hermann Kriege’s
discrediting of the Communist Party. The criticism of Kriege’s trend, published
in 1846 in Westphälische Dampfboot[3]

and
reprinted in Volume II of Mehring’s edition of Marx’s works, is of tremendous
interest to present-day Russian Social-Democrats.


The point is that the agrarian question at that time had been brought to the
fore by the course of the American social movement, as is the case now in
Russia; it was not a question of a developed capitalist society, but, on the
contrary, of the creation of the primary and fundamental conditions for a real
development of capitalism. This circumstance is of particular importance for
drawing a parallel between Marx’s attitude towards the American ideas of
“general redistribution” and the attitude of Russian
Social-Democrats to wards the present-day peasant movement.


Kriege gave no data in his journal for a concrete study of the distinctive
features of the American social system and for defining the true character of
the movement of the

    

contemporary agrarian reformers who campaigned for the abolition of rent. What
      Kriege did do, though (quite in the style of our
      “Socialists-Revolutionaries”), was to clothe the question of the
      agrarian revolution in bombastic and high-sounding phrases: “Every
      poor man,” wrote Kriege, “will become a useful member of human
      society as soon as he is given an opportunity to engage in productive
      work. He will be assured such an opportunity for all time if society gives
      him a piece of land on which he can keep himself and his family.... If
      this immense area (the 1,400,000,000 acres of North American public domain) is withdrawn from commerce and is secured in restricted amounts for

       labour,[2]

 an end will be put to poverty in America at one stroke....”


To this Marx replies: “One would have expected him to understand that
legislators have no power to decree that the evolution of the patriarchal
system, which Kriege desires, into an industrial system be checked, or that the
industrial and commercial states of the East coast be thrown back to patriarchal
barbarism.”


Thus, we have before us a real plan for an American general redistribution: the
withdrawal of a vast land expanse from commerce, the securing of title to the
land, limitation of the extent of landownership or land tenure. And from the
very outset Marx subjects this utopianism to sober criticism, he points out
that the patriarchal system evolves inevitably into the industrial system,
i.e., to use present-day idiom, he points out the inevitability of the
development of capitalism. But it would be a great mistake to think
that the utopian
dreams of the participants in the movement caused Marx to adopt a negative
attitude to the movement in general. Nothing of the kind. Already then, at the
very beginning of his literary activity, Marx was able to extract the real and
progressive content of a movement from its tawdry ideological trappings. In the
second part of his criticism, entitled “The Economics [i.e., the
political economy]

    

of the Volkstribun and Its Attitude to Young America”, Marx
wrote:



“We fully recognise the historical justification of the movement of the
American National Reformers. We know that this movement strives for a result
which, true, would give a temporary impetus to the industrialisation of modern
bourgeois society, but which, as a product of the proletarian movement, and as
an attack on landed property in general, especially under prevailing American
conditions, must inevitably lead, by its own consequences, to
communism. Kriege, who with the German Communists in New York joined
the Anti-Rent
Bewegung [movement], clothes this simple fact in bombastic phrases,
without entering into the content of the movement, thereby proving that he is
quite at sea as regards the connection between young America and American
social conditions. We will cite another example of his outpouring of enthusiasm
for humanity over the agrarians’ plan for parcelling the land on an American
scale.


“In issue No. 10 of the Volkstribun, in an article entitled ’What
We Want’, we read: ’The American National Reformers call the land the common
heritage of all men ... and demand that the national legislature pass measures
to preserve the 1,400,000,000 acres of land not yet fallen into the hands of the
grabbing speculators, as the inalienable common property of the whole of
mankind.’ In order to preserve for all mankind this ’inalienable common property’, he accepts the plan of the National Reformers: ’to provide every peasant,
whatever country he may come from, with 160 acres of American land for his
subsistence’; or, as it is expressed in issue No. 14, in ’An Answer to Conze’:
’Of these unappropriated public lands no one is to have a holding in excess of
160 acres, and this only provided he tills it himself.’ Thus, in order to
preserve the land as ’inalienable common property’, and for ’the whole of
mankind’ besides, it is necessary immediately to begin parcelling it
out. Kriege, moreover, imagines that he can rule out the necessary consequences
of this allotment—concentration, industrial progress, and the like, by
legislation. He regards 160 acres of land as an invariable quantity, as though
the value of such an area did not vary according to its quality. The ’peasants’
will have to exchange the produce of the land, if

    

not the land itself, among themselves and with others, and, having gone thus
      far, they will soon find that one ’peasant’, even without capital, thanks
      to his labour and the greater original fertility of his 160 acres, has
      reduced another to the position of his farm-hand. Besides, what matters it
      whether it is ’the land’ or the produce of the land that ’falls into the
      hands of grabbing speculators’? Let us seriously examine Kriege’s gift to
      mankind. One thousand four hundred million acres are to be

I)reserved 

as
      the ’inalienable common property of the whole of mankind’, with every
      ’peasant’ getting 160 acres. We can therefore compute the magnitude of
      Kriege’s ’mankind’: exactly 8,750,000 ’peasants’, who, counting five to a
      family, represent 43,750,000 people. We can also compute the duration of
      the ’for all time’ during which ’the proletariat, as the representative of
      the whole of mankind’, at least in the U.S.A., can lay claim to all the
      land. If the population of the U.S.A. continues to increase at its present
      rate, i.e., if it doubles in 25 years, then this ’for all time’ will last
      something under 40 years; by then these 1,400,000,000 acres will have been
      occupied, and future generations will have nothing to ’lay claim to’. But
      as the free grant of land would greatly in crease immigration, Kriege’s
      ’for all time’ might come to an end even sooner, particularly if it is
      borne in mind that land for 44,000,000 people would not be an adequate
      outlet even for the pauperism existing in Europe today; for in Europe one
      out of every 10 persons is a pauper, and the British Isles alone account
      for 7,000,000 paupers. A similar example of naiveté in political economy
      is to be found in issue No. 13, in the article ’To the Women’, in which
      Kriege says that if the city of New York gave up its 52,000 acres of land
      on Long Island, this would suffice to rid New York of all pauperism,
      misery, and crime ’at one stroke’ and for ever.


“Had Kriege regarded the movement for freeing the land as an early form of
the proletarian movement, necessary under certain conditions, as a movement
which, by reason of the position in social life of the class from which it
emanates, must necessarily develop into a communist movement; had he shown why
the communist aspirations in America had to manifest themselves initially in
this agrarian form,

    

which seems to contradict all communism, there would have been nothing to object
to. But he declares what is merely a subordinate form of a movement of
definite, real people to be a cause of mankind in general. He represents this
cause ... as the ultimate and highest aim of every movement in general, thus
turning the definite aims of the movement into sheer bombastic nonsense. In the
same article (issue No. 10) he continues to chant his paean: ’And so the old
dreams of the Europeans would at last come true. A place would be prepared for
them on this side of the ocean which they would only have to take and to
fructify with the labour of their hands, so as to be able proudly to declare to
all the tyrants of the world, ’This is my cabin, which you have not
built; this is my hearth whose glow fills your hearts with envy.’


“He might have added, This is my dunghill, which I, my wife, my
children, my manservant, and my cattle have produced. And who are the Europeans
whose ’dreams’ would thus come true? Not the communist workers, but bankrupt
shopkeepers and handicraftsmen, or ruined cottars, who yearn for the good
fortune of once again becoming petty bourgeois and peasants in America. And what
is the ’dream’ that is to be fulfilled by means of these 1,400,000,000 acres? No
other than that all men be converted into private owners, a dream which is as
unrealisable and as communistic as the dream to convert all men into emperors,
kings, and popes.”



Marx’s criticism is full of caustic sarcasm. He scourges Kriege for those very
aspects of his views which we now observe among our
“Socialists-Revolutionaries”, namely, phrase-mongering,
petty-bourgeois utopias represented as the highest revolutionary utopianism,
incomprehension of the real foundations of the modern economic system and its
development. With remarkable penetration, Marx, who was then only the
future economist, points to the role of exchange and commodity
production.The peasants, he says, will exchange the produce of the land, if not
the land itself, and that says everything! The question is dealt with in a way
that is largely applicable to the Russian peasant movement and its
petty-bourgeois “socialist” ideologists.


Marx, however, does not simply “repudiate” this petty bourgeois
movement, he does not dogmatically ignore it, he

    

does not fear to soil his hands by contact with the movement of the
      revolutionary petty-bourgeois democrats—a fear that is
      characteristic of many doctrinaires. While mercilessly
      ridiculing the absurd ideological trappings of the movement,
      Marx strives in a sober, materialist manner to

deter mine 

its real historical content, the
    consequences that must inevitably follow from it because of objective
    conditions, regardless of the will and the consciousness, the dreams and the
    theories, of the various individuals. Marx, therefore, does not condemn, but
    fully approves communist support of the movement. Adopting the dialectical
    standpoint, i.e., examining the movement from every aspect, taking into
    account both the past and the future, Marx notes the revolutionary aspect
    of the attack on private property in land. He recognises the petty-bourgeois
    movement as a peculiar initial form of the proletarian, communist
    movement. You will not achieve what you dream of by means of this movement,
    says Marx to Kriege: instead of fraternity, you will get petty-bourgeois
    exclusiveness; instead of inalienable peasant allotments, you will have the
    drawing of the land into commerce; instead of a blow at the grabbing
    speculators, you will witness the expansion of the basis for capitalist
    development. But the capitalist evil you are vainly hoping to avoid is a
    historical benefit, for it will accelerate social development tremendously
    and bring ever so much nearer new and higher forms of the communist
    movement. A blow struck at landed property will facilitate the inevitable
    further blows at property in general. The revolutionary action of the lower
    class for a change that will temporarily provide a restricted prosperity,
    and by no means for all, will facilitate the inevitable further
    revolutionary action of the very lowest class for a change that will really
    ensure complete human happiness for all toilers.


Marx’s presentation of the case against Kriege should serve as a model for us
Russian Social-Democrats. That the peasant movement in Russia today is of a
really petty-bourgeois nature there can be no doubt. We must explain this fact
by every means in our power, and we must ruthlessly and irreconcilably combat
all the illusions of all the “Socialists Revolutionaries” or
primitive socialists on this score. The organisation of an independent party of
the proletariat which,

    

through all democratic upheavals, will strive for the complete socialist
revolution, must be our constant aim, not to be lost sight of for a moment. But
to turn away from the peasant movement for this reason would be sheer
philistinism and pedantry. No, there is no doubt as to the revolutionary and
democratic nature of this movement, and we must with all our might support it,
develop it, make it a politically conscious and definitely class movement,
advance it, and go hand in hand with it to the end—for we go much further
than the end of any peasant movement; we go to the very end of the division of
society into classes. There is hardly another country in the world where the
peasantry is experiencing such suffering, such oppression and degradation as in
Russia. The worse this oppression has been, the more powerful will now be the
peasantry’s awakening, the more irresistible its revolutionary onset. The
class-conscious revolutionary proletariat should support this onset with all its
might, so that it may leave stand no stone of this old, accursed, feudal,
autocratic, and slavish Russia; so that it may create a new generation of free
and courageous people, a new republican country in which our proletarian
struggle for socialism will be able freely to expand.

A reprint of the decision of the “Party Council” from
Iskra, No. 95, dated Geneva, April 7, 1905, has just appeared. This
decision is a veritable maze of “deviations from the truth”. Let us
consider the major ones.


We are told that the Council has taken care not to let the inner struggle in the
Party undermine its unity. This is untrue. All Party members should know from
unrefuted and irrefutable documents that over a year ago, in January 1904, Lenin
and Vasilyev, members of the Central Committee, proposed in the Council that a
call be issued to the entire Party to stop the boycott and the secret
appropriation of Party funds by the

       circles.[1]
The Council rejected their proposal. Instead, it participated directly in the secret split of
the Party, thus sanctioning the struggle of the secret organisation of the
Minority for “co-optation”. This struggle, as is now proved by
documentary evidence, had been going on since the Second Congress, viz., from
August 1903 to November or December 1904.


Thus, from January 1904 on, the Council was no longer the supreme Party body,
but a tool of the secret organisation of the Minority. The existence of this
organisation was admitted publicly and in print, not only by the conciliatory
C.C., but even by Iskra, at the time when the C.C. sided with the
Minority.


As a tool of the Minority’s secret organisation, the Council has exerted all
efforts to evade the demand of the committees for an all-Party congress. For
eighteen months Social-Democratic activities in Russia were hampered
by the disruptive

    

tactics of the Minority abroad. For eighteen months the committees in
Russia waged an intense unremitting struggle for a congress against the Geneva
Council, which either pigeonholed the committees’ resolutions or returned them
with insulting remarks (“blackguards, sheer humbug, fabrication of
documents” are the expressions contained in a letter by Martov; see
Orlovsky’s pamphlet The Council Against the Party). Every important
step in this painful struggle against the machinations of the promoters of the
secret split is now documented in Party literature. As far back as October 1904,
i.e., six months ago, it was proved— e.g., in Orlovsky’s The
Council Against the Party— that the Council, without offering
reasons, had refrained from convening the Congress, although called upon to do
so by the Party Rules. After that, one Party committee in Russia after another
formally voiced no confidence in the Council and in all the central
bodies. The Council, how ever, ignored these actions and with no sense of shame
flouted the Party. The Council was a tool of the Minority. Now the Council, in
its decision of April 7, 1905, has openly declared itself a party to the
dispute, but at the same time it has had no scruples about using the title,
the rights, and the powers of an all-Party body, and it has refused to
return to the Party the mandate it has received from it. The thing has been a
flagrant breach of confidence from beginning to end.


When, finally, the Party committees in Russia, seeing that the Council was
evading the Congress, themselves called the Congress through the
“Bureau” which they had elected at three conferences, even the
C.C., which had gone over to the Minority, hastened to rectify its
mistake. The C.C. in Russia, which not only did not sympathise with the
Committees of the Majority but actually combated them, upon seeing how
matters stood in Russia and knowing the Majority to be really preponderant
there, had to admit that the Bureau of Committees of the Majority had been absolutely impartial in convening the Congress and had had to rebel against the
Council. In its appeal of March 12, 1905, to the general membership of the
Party, the C.C. in Russia, as we noted in the press and as all Party workers in
Russia know from the declaration, openly rebelled against
    

the Council; it declared in Point 5 of the declaration that “the
    March 8 resolution of the Council (Iskra, No. 89) against the
    Congress is not considered grounds for halting organisation work for the
    Congress”.


What is the significance of this announcement, which our Council so studiously
passes over? The significance is that the C.C. in Russia, knowing Russian
affairs and, evidently, having investigated the assertions of the Council
abroad, designates the assertions as untrue and the pretexts for not
convening the Congress as pure invention; it considers as a proved fact
that the demand for the Congress has the support of the overwhelming majority of
the Russian committees that had a chance to study the facts of the case.


Hence, the silence of our Council regarding the declaration made by the C.C. in
Point 5! For it is in effect a direct admission to the whole Party membership
that the Council has made false allegations, that it has misrepresented the
general opinion of the Party!


In vain, therefore, does the Council attempt to mislead the Party once more by
proposing conferences and agreements between the disputants. In Russia such
an agreement has already been reached. The centre of the
Mensheviks in Russia was the Central Committee; Iskra itself
admitted as much in its
announcement that the July declaration of the C.C. had been accepted by the
Menshevik organisations. The centre of the Majority in Russia was the Bureau of
Committees of the Majority. The Russian centres of both sides to the
dispute have agreed to hold a joint congress. It is evident from this
that there are Mensheviks in Russia who set a slightly higher value on the Party
spirit and Party unity than do the Mensheviks abroad. It is evident that the
Russian Mensheviks themselves, as represented by their centre, the C.C., expose
the Council abroad and turn their backs on it. It is evident that after an
agreement has been reached between the Russian centres of the disputants, any
agreement with the Council abroad, i.e., with the gentlemen sitting in Geneva,
is entirely out of the question.


In vain, therefore, does our Council speak of its deposition by the C.C. in the
future tense. It is not a matter of the future but of the past. Point 5 of the
C.C.’s appeal to the Party, dated March 12, 1905, proves to all who can understand

    

 what they read that this deposition has actually taken place. Russia,
represented by the united centres of the two sides, has overthrown the group
abroad. The Party Council now represents merely the Geneva group and not the
Party.


How accurately this describes the state of affairs in the Party may be seen very
clearly from the following. The Council declares that its decision of April 7,
1905, was adopted unanimously. Party members who read this are, of course,
supposed to believe that the two members of the C.C. on the Council
also had a hand in this decision.

How ever, 

any such idea, which the
Council tries to inspire in the readers, is very much open to question.


The proof: As we stated in Vperyod, No. 13, we are not yet authorised
to publish the agreement between the Bureau of Committees of the Majority and
the C.C. Still, we were informed that at least one point of the agreement might
be made public, should the Party Council decide against convening the Third
Party Congress.


This eventuality has now arisen.


We, therefore, now publish this point—Point 1 of the unpublished
agreement.


“Agreement between the Bureau of Committees of the Majority and the
Central Committee, signed March 12, 1905.


“Point 1. The Organising Committee composed of representatives of the
Central Committee and of the Bureau of Committees of the Majority shall
organise the Third Party Congress immediately, regardless of any resolution the
Council may adopt on the convocation of the Congress.”


Clear enough, it would seem.


The C.C. expressly stipulated that it would refuse to abide by any
future resolutions of the Council, without making this public for the
time being, in the hope that the Council might for once act honestly. This means
that the Russian Mensheviks still believed it possible for the Council to do
the right thing, even if by way of exception.


The Russian Mensheviks, represented by their Russian centre, have now been
disillusioned.


Hence, it is now proved conclusively that even the C.C., whose sympathies were
entirely on the side of the Council, was compelled to expose its colleague
abroad to the full.
 

It now remains for us in conclusion to put one small question to the reader: In
      view of all this, what is one to think of the members of the Council
      sitting in Geneva, who have declared publicly, in print, that the Council
      decision dated Geneva, April 7, 1905, had been adopted unanimously?

Dear Comrade,


On April 4 (17), the Central Committee notified the Party Council that it had
appointed Comrades Johansen[3]

and Valerian[4]

to represent it on the Council and requested
that a meeting of the Council as constituted in conformity with the Party Rules
be called in the immediate future.


Having received no reply to this request, we took the liberty of approaching
you a second time, and on April 22 (9) we received an answer in which you
refused to call a meeting of the Council as long as we “go on acting as
violators of the Party Rules and usurpers of the Council’s functions”.


The situation arising from your refusal to call an official meeting of the
Council prevents us from presenting a number of communications to the Party
Council; and since, in our opinion, it is impossible to withhold them any
longer, we are obliged to address ourselves to you before the whole Party
membership with a written recital of the main statements that we intended to
submit to the next meeting of
the Council.


1. The Central Committee informs the Party Council that up to April 4 (17) the
   following qualified Party organisations went on record for the Third Party
   Congress: the St. Petersburg, Moscow, Northern League, Nizhni-Novgorod,
   Tver, Tula, Riga, Siberian League, Voronezh, Saratov, Odessa, Caucasian
   League (8 votes), Nikolayev, Ural, Orel-Bryansk, Kursk, Smolensk, Polesye,
   North-Western, Kharkov, and Samara committees—a total of 21
   organisations, entitled

    

to 48 votes. The C.C. also declared itself in favour of calling the Congress and
      decided to send a delegate, as well as its representatives on the Party
      Council, to the Congress.


From the Astrakhan, Kazan, Kuban, and Don committees, from the League of the
Mining and Metal District, from the Ekaterinoslav Committee, from the Crimean
League, from the League, from the Editorial Board of the Central Organ, and from
the three members of the Council residing abroad either no resolutions were
received or the resolutions received declared the convening of the Congress to
be undesirable.


Finally, the Kiev Committee, although it had adopted a resolution against the
Congress on March 25, subsequently elected a delegate to the Congress and sent
him abroad.


Thus, out of the

       75 votes[1]

that would represent the whole Party at the
Congress, 52 (not counting the Kiev Commit tee) were in favour of convening the
Third Party Congress.


Under these circumstances the C.C. deems it necessary to insist, through its
representatives on the Party Council, that the Council immediately fulfil its
formal obligation, in accordance with Clause 2 of the Party Rules, to convene
the Congress when this is demanded by Party organisations commanding aggregately
half the total voting strength of the Congress.


Since, according to the information of the C.C., many more votes have now been
cast for the Congress than are required by the Rules (52 out of 75), the Council
must immediately and unconditionally give notice of the convening of the
Congress, without stipulating any prior conditions or demands not provided for
in the Party Rules.


2. The Central Committee is profoundly convinced that, even granting the fullest
   sincerity of all Council members, a question of such extraordinary importance
   as the convening of the Party Congress, at a time such as the Party and all
   Russia are now living through, cannot be decided on purely formal
   grounds. Our Party Rules are not explicit enough for that. Thus, they give no
   answer to the question of the time limit within which the Party Council is
   obliged to convene the Congress after the required number of votes in
   favour has been cast. Respecting this and other questions,

    

 the central bodies of the Party are obliged to resort to an
interpretation of the Rules and act not only in keeping with the
formally expressed will of the Party, which, as is evident from Clause 1, has
declared in favour of the Congress, but in conformity with the actual state of
affairs in the Party as well as in Russia generally.


The C.C. considers it its duty to inform the Party Council that the Party crisis
in Russia has grown to such dimensions that Party work has been brought to an
almost complete standstill. The situation in the committees has reached the
height of confusion. There is hardly a single question of tactics or
organisation that does not provoke the most violent dissension locally between
the groups, more often than not because the disputants belong to different camps
in the Party rather than on essential matters. Neither the Party Council, nor
the Central Organ, nor the C.C. has sufficient prestige with the majority of the
Party workers; dual organisations are springing up everywhere, hampering each
other’s work and discrediting the Party in the eyes of the proletariat. To
comrades active chiefly as publicists, whose work can go on uninterrupted even
in an atmosphere of mistrust on the part of a large portion of the Party
membership, the present unbearable, blind-alley situation in which general Party
matters stand is perhaps not so apparent as to the Party workers of the
practical centre, who come daily up against increasing difficulties in their
work in Russia. The time has come when the growth of the internal contradictions in our Party life begins to tax the narrow and, as we can all see now, far
from perfect framework of the Rules which the Second Party Congress has given
us. New forms are needed, or at least a modification of the old; and this can
only be done by the sole lawgiver of the Social-Democratic Party—the
Party Congress, since it and it alone has the right to establish rules
binding on all, rules that cannot be imposed by any conference, or any
local agreement. Realising the importance of resolving the Party crisis by means
of an immediate congress, the majority of the committees in Russia have taken
all the necessary steps for the convening of the Congress as soon as possible,
including the election and the sending of delegates; this applies not only to
the committees of the Majority, which had previously declared

    

for the Congress, but also to the greater part of the Minority committees, of
      the groups and the periphery organisations. The Party has declared for
      the Congress and has expended considerable means and efforts in
      preparation for it. The central bodies of the Party have no formal right
      to postpone notice of the Congress now that the obligation to convene it
      is incontestable, and they are morally bound to do their utmost to ensure
      that the Party’s expenditure of energy shall not have been wasted. To keep
      scores of delegates, our most active comrades, abroad indefinitely, when
      they are so badly needed in Russia, or still worse, to have them go back
      to Russia from a congress not held because the comrades of the Central
      Organ refused to forego the letter of the Party Rules for the spirit, for
      the higher interest of preserving Party unity, would be an unpardonable
      waste of Party forces and would mean that the leaders of the Party fell
      short of the tasks which Party life has put before them. When forms have
      outlived themselves, when a growing and developing Party feels cramped in
      these forms, we cannot remedy things by harping for the hundredth time on
      the sanctity of the letter of the law. That is no way out of the crisis;
      the only possible solution is to call the Party Congress.


3. On the strength of Clause 6 of the Party Rules which empowers it to organise
   and conduct all activities of general Party importance, the C.C. insists upon
   its right, inalienable and not subject to restriction, to take all the
   preparatory measures and to perform all the practical work involved in the
   organisation of Party congresses. The C.C., as the only practical centre of
   the Party, considers all attempts of other Party bodies to interfere in this
   work a breach of the Party Rules, and it protests against them as an
   encroachment upon its rights. As for the rights granted to the Party Council
   in Clause 2 of the Rules with regard to the convocation of Party congresses,
   the C.C. interprets them to mean that the Council shall give notice of such
   convocation and control the work actually done by the C.C.


In view of the foregoing, the C.C. admits that its agreement with the Bureau of
Committees of the Majority to call the Third Party Congress contravenes the
Party Rules only insofar as it expresses (see Point I of the agreement) the

    

intention of convening the Congress even without prior official notice by the
Party Council.


4. Having received word that eighteen qualified Party organisations, apart from
   the C.C. itself, had passed resolutions in favour of convening the Third
   Congress, the C.C., on March 12, decided to bring this to the attention of
   the Council, to whom it sent the following statement: “The Central
   Committee notifies the Party Council that to date (March 12) eighteen
   qualified Party committees (besides the C.C.), or more than half the total
   voting strength at the Third Congress under the Party Rules, have declared in
   favour of convening the Third Party Congress. Similar resolutions from
   several other committees are expected in the very near future. Under the
   circumstances the C.C. deems it necessary to convene the Congress immediately
   and asks the Party Council to give due notice of its convocation by adopting
   a corresponding resolution. All documents in the possession of the
   C.C. relating to this question will be submitted to the Party Council in the
   near future.” Besides this, the C.C., as early as March 10, instructed its
   agent, Comrade Vadim,[5]

to go abroad immediately in order to
   report the situation to the Party Council, to which he had been accredited
   by the C.C. Owing to an unfortunate coincidence, Comrade Vadim was arrested
   before he reached the frontier. As for the document cited above, in which the
   C.C. records the receipt of resolutions that oblige the Council to give
   immediate notice of the Congress, we find that, according to private
   information received on April 4 (17) from Comrade Deutsch by the members of
   the C.C., Comrades Johansen and Valerian, it was not received at
   all. Afterwards Comrade Deutsch corrected this information, stating that the
   document had been received at Locarno, but only after the Council’s meeting
   of April 7. Since we, the representatives of the C.C., were barred from the
   session of the Council, we are not in a position to determine why there was
   such a delay in delivering the C.C.’s statement to the Council
   members. However, even if it was received after the meeting of the three
   Council members at Locarno, the document, which established a clear case for
   the convocation of the Congress, was of such importance that the comrades
   from the Central Organ and the fifth member of the Council should

    

have met immediately and taken the decision prescribed by the Party Rules, or,
      at least, in view of the failure of the C.C. representative to arrive
      because of his arrest before reaching the frontier, they should have held
      up publication of the resolution of April 7.


5. The C.C. questions the validity of the decisions which the Party Council has
   adopted since February 1005, because after the return of Comrades
   B. and Vtorov[6]

from abroad at the end of January, the C.C. did
   not accredit anyone to the Party Council. Long before the present conflict
   between the C.C. and the Council members abroad, specifically, on February
   14, 1904, a plenary meeting of the C.C. adopted a decision construing Clause
   4 of the Party Rules relating to the representation of the C.C. on the
   Council to mean that the members of the C.C. who are delegated to the Council
   must be accredited by the C.C. as a body, and that even members of the
   C.C. who for one reason or another are abroad have no right to attend
   meetings of the Council unless a resolution to that effect has been adopted
   by a plenary meeting of the C.C.


This explanatory decision of the C.C. has served as the basis for representation
of the C.C. abroad. Since February 1904 all representatives of the C.C. without
exception have sat in the Party Council only after having previously been
endorsed by a plenary meeting of the C.C. Comrades Glebov and Lenin,
Comrade Glebov in the course of his second stay abroad, Comrade B., who was the
C.C. representative on the Council until his departure for Russia, Comrade
Vtorov, who went abroad in January with authority to negotiate certain questions
with the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and to attend the meetings of the
Council, all received their credentials, not from any member of the C.C. or from
his predecessor on the Party Council, but from a plenary meeting of the t.C. The
reason that prompted the C.C. to reach the mentioned decision of February
14, 1904, and to adhere to it so rigidly in its entire subsequent practice was
that such a method of organising the representation of the C.C. on the Council
was the only way to prevent comrades who are not in close enough touch with the
C.C. and not familiar in detail with its policy on all questions of Party life
from speaking at the Party Council in the name of the

    

C.C. We go further: the provision that only a plenary meeting of the
C.C. could appoint the two Council members was the sole means whereby the
centre working in Russia could have anything like parity of influence in the
Party Council with the comrades from the Central Organ, who preponderate in the
Council not only numerically, but also in point of authority, which some of them
have won through long years of honourable service in the front ranks of
Social-Democracy, both Russian and international. With all due respect to these
comrades on the Council, the C.C. would, however, fail in its duty to the entire
Party if it permitted, even for a short time, a change in the composition of the
Party Council whereby all questions would be decided by a body consisting
exclusively of comrades, who, worthy and respected though they be, cannot by
dint of circumstances be in direct con tact with the real practical work carried
on in Russia. Since our request for a meeting of the Council was denied, we
could not determine on what grounds Comrade Deutsch, whom Comrade Vtorov had
appointed C.C. representative pro tem. on the “Technical
Committee” abroad, considered himself entitled to speak at the Party
Council in the name of the C.C., with whose activities in Russia he never had
any contact. The C.C. declares Comrade Deutsch’s action to be invalid, since it
was not authorised by the C.C.; even assuming that Comrade Vtorov (at that time
only an agent of the C.C.) or any member of the C.C. had asked Comrade Deutsch
to represent it on the Party Council, this will not cure the illegality of
Comrade Deutsch’s position, since such authorisation can be granted only by a
plenary meeting of the C.C., which was not done in the case of Comrade
Deutsch. On the grounds aforesaid, the C.C. considers all decisions of the Party
Council subsequent to the departure from abroad of Comrades B. and Vtorov to
have been taken wholly without the participation of the C.C. and demands a
reconsideration of all questions at a new meeting to which the rightful
representatives of the C.C. shall be invited.


6. The C.C. denies the right of the Party Council to pass judgement on any of
   the centres and to demand from them absolute submission to all its
   decisions. According to the Rules, the function of the Council is to
   co-ordinate and

    

unify the activities of the C.C. and of the Editorial Board of the Central
      Organ. However, in the event of a conflict between one of the centres
      and the Council, obviously only a special Party congress can settle the
      dispute. The word of the Party Council cannot be final in case of a
      disagreement between itself and one of the centres, since then the
      Council would simultaneously be both judge and a party to the dispute. However, as a result of the refusal to call a meeting of the Party
      Council with the participation of C.C. representatives, the C.C. is not
      only condemned by the three members of the Council (editors of the Central
      Organ) but even penalised by being deprived of its inalienable right,
      guaranteed by the Party Rules, to be represented in the Party Council.


Still other measures are being taken to force the C.C. to submit under all
circumstances to the decisions of the three members of the Council (editors of
the Central Organ). Thus, in reply to the C.C.’s legitimate demand to its own
agent abroad, Comrade Deutsch, that all its technical and financial affairs be
handed over to Comrade Valerian, the member of the C.C. entrusted by it with
assuming charge of them, Comrade Deutsch, refused, giving as his reason the
conflict between the C.C. and the Council.


Thus, while the C.C. in Point I of its agreement with the Bureau of Committees
of the Majority expressed its willingness to convene the Congress even in the
event of a refusal on the part of the Council and thus came into conflict with
the Rules, the three Council members in their turn broke the Rules twice by
depriving the C.C. of its right to participate in the Council and to manage and
control its own technical and financial undertakings abroad (a breach of Clauses
2 and 6 of the Party Rules).


In placing before the Party this conflict (for which the Party Rules provide no
solution) between the Party Council (represented only by two members from the
Central Organ and the fifth member of the Council), on the one side, and the
C.C. on the other, the C.C., in view of the refusal of Comrade Plekhanov,
Chairman of the Party Council, to call a meeting of that body, declares that by
this action, which is a flagrant breach of the Rules, the Chairman of the

    

Council makes it impossible for the Council to function and, in effect, wilfully
annuls the Party Council.


Absolute submission of the C.C. to the Party Council, on which you, comrade,
insist, as the sine qua non for calling a meeting of the Council,
actually amounts to postponing the Congress indefinitely and flouting the
clearly expressed will of the Party.


Placing its loyalty to the Party above loyalty to three foreign-resident members
of the Council, the C.C. submits the entire conflict to the
judgement of the Party itself.

The news of the Central Committee’s support to the Bureau of Committees of the
Majority on the question of convening the all-Party Congress has
brought from Iskra, No. 94, a retort of abuse and hysteria, further
personal suspicions, fairy-tales about the strength of the Minority groups, and
so on. Naturally, we ignore all these tricks, which are worthy of the famous
League Congress. Strictly speaking, only two points are worth taking up. If the
Congress does take place, says Iskra, it will be only as a
conference of separated trends. In other words, the new-Iskrists admit
their break-away from the Party, they admit the split as an accomplished
fact. We would always prefer this frank admission to a sneaking secret
split. But how do you make this out, gentlemen? You admit yourselves to be one
part of the Party that has broken away from the other and yet modestly retain
the titles and ranks that belong to the whole Party (“Central Organ”,
“Council”)! Is this honourable?


Secondly, Iskra usually considers the Party to be split when it is a
question of the centres reporting to the Party, while considering the Party to
be united when the issue is the power of the centres over the Party. The very
thing is now happening again. On the one hand, “separated trends”;
on the other, “the Congress can be convened only by the
Council”. Fine, gentlemen! But why, then, is your “Council”
silent? Why did it not respond to the C.C.’s statement of March 4, 1905? Why no
word about the Council in Iskra, No. 94? Are not the Party members
justified in asking whether the Council exists at all, whether it is in a
position to meet and make decisions?

RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY

Workers of ALL Countries, Unite)

Comrades workers! The great holiday of the workers of all the world is
coming. On the First of May they celebrate their awakening to light and
knowledge, their association in one fraternal union for the struggle against all
oppression, against all tyranny, against all exploitation, for a socialist
system of society. All who work, who feed the rich and the nobility by their
labour, who spend their lives in back breaking toil for scanty wages, who never
enjoy the fruits of their own labour, who live like beasts of burden amidst the
luxury and splendour of our civilisation—all stretch out their hands to
fight for the emancipation and happiness of the workers. Down with enmity
between workers of different nationalities or different creeds! This enmity can
only benefit the plunderers and tyrants, who live by the ignorance and disunion
of the proletariat. Jews and Christians, Armenians and Tatars, Poles and
Russians, Finns and Swedes, Letts and Germans—all, all of them
march together under the one common banner of socialism. All workers
are brothers, and
their solid union is the only guarantee of the well-being and happiness of all
working and oppressed mankind. On the First of May this union of the workers of
all countries, international Social-Democracy, reviews its forces and gathers
its strength for a further unremitting and unswerving struggle for freedom,
equality, and fraternity.


Comrades! We stand now in Russia on the eve of great events. We are engaged in
the last desperate fight with the autocratic tsarist government, we must carry
this fight on to its victorious end. See what calamities this government of
brutes and tyrants, of venal courtiers and hangers on of capital, has brought
upon the entire Russian people! The tsarist government has plunged the Russian
people into

    

an insane war against Japan. Hundreds of thousands of young lives have been torn
      away from the people to perish in the Far East. Words cannot describe all
      the calamities that this war brings upon us. And what is the war for? For
      Manchuria, which our predatory tsarist government has seized from China!
      Russian blood is being shed and our country ruined for the sake of foreign
      territory. Life is becoming harder and harder for the workers and
      peasants; the capitalists and officials keep tightening the noose round
      their necks, while the tsarist government is sending the people out to
      plunder foreign territory. Bungling tsarist generals and venal officials
      have led to the destruction of the Russian. fleet, squandered hundreds and
      thousands of millions of the nation’s wealth, and lost entire armies, but
      the war still goes on, claiming further sacrifices. The people are being
      ruined, industry and trade are coming to a standstill, and famine and
      cholera are imminent; but the autocratic government in its blind madness
      follows the old path; it is ready to ruin Russia if only it can save a
      handful of brutes and tyrants; it is launching another war besides the one
      with Japan—war against the entire Russian people.


Never before has Russia experienced such an awakening from her slumber, from
her oppression and enslavement, as she is experiencing today. All classes of
society are stirring, from the workers and peasants to the landlords
and capitalists, and voices of protest have been raised everywhere, in
St. Petersburg and
the Caucasus, in Poland and Siberia. Everywhere the people demand an end to the
war; they demand the establishment of a free people’s rule, the convocation of
deputies of all citizens without exception in a Constituent Assembly to
institute a people’s government and save the nation from the abyss into which
the tsarist government is pushing it. Workers of St. Petersburg, about two
hundred thousand strong, went to the tsar on Sunday, the Ninth of January, with
the priest Georgi Gapon in order to submit these demands of the people. The tsar
received the workers as enemies. He shot down thousands of unarmed workers in
the streets of St. Petersburg. The struggle is now on all over Russia. Workers
are on strike, demanding freedom and a better life. Blood is being spilt in Riga
and in Poland, on the Volga and in the South. Everywhere the peasants are

    

rising. The struggle for freedom is becoming the struggle of the entire people.


The tsarist government has gone mad. It wants to borrow money to carry on the
war, but no one will trust it with a loan any longer. It promises to convene
representatives of the people, but actually everything remains unchanged; the
persecutions do not cease, the lawlessness of the officials proceeds as
before; there are no free public meetings, no freely circulated people’s
newspapers; the prisons in which fighters for the working-class cause are
languishing have not been thrown open. The tsarist government is trying to set
one people against another. It has brought about a massacre in Baku by
maligning the Armenians among the Tatars; now it is preparing a fresh massacre
aimed at the Jews by fanning hatred against them among the ignorant people.


Comrades workers! We will tolerate no longer such outrageous treatment of the
Russian people. We will rise to defend freedom, we will strike back at all who
try to deflect the wrath of the people from the real enemy. We will rise up in
arms to overthrow the tsarist government and win freedom for the entire
people. To arms, workers and peasants! Hold secret meetings, form fighting
squads, get whatever weapons you can, send trusted men to consult with the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party! Let this year’s First of May be for us the
celebration of the people’s uprising, let us prepare for it and await the signal
for the decisive attack on the tyrant. Down with the tsarist government! We will
overthrow it and set up a provisional revolutionary government to convene a
Constituent Assembly of the people. Let people’s deputies be elected by
universal, direct, and equal vote, through secret ballot. Let all fighters for
freedom be released from prison or brought back from exile. Let public meetings
be held openly and people’s newspapers be printed without surveillance by the
accursed officials. Let all the people arm, let a rifle be given to every
worker, so that the people themselves, not a handful of plunderers, may decide
their own destiny. Let free peasants’ committees be set up in the countryside to
overthrow the serf-owning landlord power, to free the people from the hateful
oppression of the officials, to restore to the peasants the land that has been
taken away from them.

 

This is what the Social-Democrats want, this is,what they call upon you to fight
      for, arms in hand: for complete freedom, for the democratic republic, for
      the eight-hour day, for peasants’ committees. Prepare then for the great
      battle, comrades workers, stop work in the factories and mills on the
      First of May, or take up arms according to the advice of the committees of
      the Social-Democratic Labour Party. The hour of the insurrection has not
      yet struck, but it is not far off now. The workers of the world are now
      looking with bated breath to the heroic Russian proletariat which has
      offered incalculable sacrifices to the cause of freedom. The
      St. Petersburg workers proclaimed on the famed Ninth of January: Freedom
      or death! Workers of all Russia, we will repeat that great battle-cry, we
      will not shrink from any sacrifices: through the uprising we will win
      freedom; through freedom, socialism!


Long live the First of May, long live international revolutionary
Social-Democracy!


Long live the freedom of the workers and peasants, long live the democratic
republic! Down with the tsarist autocracy!

Bulygin, as the St. Petersburg aristocratic circles justly remark, is now
playing for time. He is trying to postpone the reforms promised by the tsar as
long as possible, and to reduce them to trifles that will in no way diminish the
power of the autocratic tsar and of autocratic officialdom. In place of a
constitution, he is preparing, as we pointed out once before in

  Vperyod,[1]

a consultative body enjoying no rights whatever. Now we have
confirmation of what we said, namely, the text of Bulygin’s project published
in the German liberal newspaper Vossische Zeitung. According to that
news paper, Bulygin, Yermolov, Shcherbatov, Meshchersky, Count Sheremetyev, and
Prince Urusov have been mentioned as authors of the project, which in substance
is as follows:


For the discussion (no more than that!) and the drafting of all bills, two
bodies shall be set up: (1) a State Council, and (2) a State Assembly. Bills may
be introduced by any member of the State Council or by no fewer than twenty
members of the Assembly. Bills are discussed and passed by the Assembly, after
which they go to the Council and finally to the tsar for his approval.
The tsar decides the form in which bills shall become law, or he vetoes them
altogether.


Thus, the Bulygin “constitution” does not limit the autocratic
regime at all but merely introduces two exclusively consultative bodies: an
Upper House and a Lower House! The Upper House, or State Council, is
to consist of 60 members elected by the Assemblies of the Nobles of 60 gubernias
(including the Polish gubernias), as well as of members appointed by the tsar
from among the officials and

    

officers. The total number of members is not to exceed 120. The term of office
      of the elected members is three years. The sessions of the Council may be
      open to the public or closed, at the discretion of the Council.


The Lower House, or State Assembly, is to consist of elective members only
(Ministers and heads of departments may sit ex officio in both Houses),
namely: 10 representatives from each of the 34 Zemstvo gubernias (a total of
340); 8 representatives from each of the three gubernias having Zemstvo
institutions but no institutions of the nobility (a total of 24); 8 from each
of the nine North-Western gubernias (72); 5 from each of the 10 Polish gubernias
(50); 5 from each of the three Baltic gubernias (15); 30 from Siberia; 30 from
the Caucasus; 15 from Central Asia and the Transcaspian region; 32 from Finland;
20 from the big cities (St. Petersburg, 6; Moscow, 5; Warsaw, 3; Odessa, 2;
Lodz, Kiev, Riga, and Kliarkov, I each); 10 from the Greek Orthodox clergy; I
each from the Catholics, Lutherans, Armenians, Mohammedans, and Jews. That makes
a total of 643 members. This Assembly is to elect an Executive Committee
consisting of a chairman, two vice-chairmen, and 15 members. Their term of
office will be three years. The Executive Committee is to be a permanent
institution; the Assembly is to meet only twice a year: February-March and
October-November. The sessions may be open or closed at the discretion of the
Assembly. During their term of office the members of the Assembly will enjoy
personal immunity. Only Russian subjects not under 25 years of age, with the
ability to read and write Russian, will be eligible. They will receive a salary
of 3,000 rubles a year.


Elections shall be held as follows: in each of the 34 Zemstvo gubernias, two
members will be elected by the Assembly of the Nobles, three by the gubernia
Zemstvo Assembly, one from the towns through special electors, three from the
peasants through special electors, and one from the merchants, also through
electors. The deputies from the non-Zemstvo gubernias are to be elected on a
similar basis; we shall not enumerate all these absurd bureaucratic and police
institutions. To illustrate the proposed method of indirect election, we shall
instance the procedure for the election of peasant representatives in the
Zemstvo gubernias,

 

Every volost elects three electors. These meet at the uyezd centre, the
Marshal of the Nobility presiding (!), and choose three electors of the
second degree. These electors meet at the gubernia capital, the gubernia Marshal
of the Nobility presiding, and elect the three representatives of the
peasantry, who must themselves be peasants. Thus the elections go
through three stages!


Mr. Bulygin does not work at all badly. He gets his salary from the tsar for
services rendered. His constitution, as the reader can see, is a downright
travesty of popular representation. The power of the autocracy, as we have
shown, is not in the least restricted. Both Houses are purely consultative,
while the tsar alone has the power to decide. The whole thing is simply a fine
promise never meant to be kept. In the first place, it is a
“representation” specifically of the nobility, of the
landlords. The nobility has half the votes in the Upper House and close
to half in the Lower (of the ten representatives from each Zemstvo gubernia,
two are from the nobility direct and three from the Zemstvo Assemblies, which
to all intents and purposes are assemblies of the nobility). The participation
of the peasants in the elections is ludicrously remote. The three-stage system
of elections makes sure that the common people are thoroughly sifted out before
they get to the Assembly.


In the second place, one is struck by the complete exclusion of the
workers. Representation in this sheep’s parliament is based entirely on
the social-estate principle. There is no workers’ “estate”, and
there cannot be. In the case of the townsfolk and the merchants, the elections
are so manipulated that only the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie filter
through the various gradations of electors, and it is extremely illuminating to
see how this bourgeoisie is pushed well into the background as compared with the
nobility. The tsar’s servants, it seems, do not much fear landlord liberalism;
they are shrewd enough to perceive under this veneer of liberalism the
profoundly conservative
social nature of “The Wild Gentleman”.[2]


It would be serving a very useful purpose to make Bulygin’s constitution widely
known among the workers and the peasants. One could hardly show up more plainly
the real aspirations and the class basis of the tsarist power which

    

is supposed to stand above the classes. One could hardly conceive of better
      material for object lessons in universal, direct, and equal suffrage by
      secret ballot.


It is interesting also to view this skimpy “constitution” of
landlords and bureaucrats in the light of the latest reports on the Russian
political parties. Except for the extreme parties, the terrorists and the
reactionaries, a certain English correspondent (who evidently mixes in
“society” and therefore does not see common people such as the
workers) counts three parties: (1) the conservative, or pan-Slavic, party (the
“Slavophil” system: to the tsar, the power of authority; to his
subjects, the power of opinion, viz., a representative assembly with
consultative powers only); (2) the liberal, or “opportunist”, party
(its leader, Shipov; its programme— like that of all opportunists—-
“between two stools”); and (3) the radical, or (a very
characteristic “or”!) constitutional party, which includes most of the
Zemstvo people, professors “and students” (?). Its programme:
universal suffrage by secret ballot.


The conservatives are said to be meeting now in St. Petersburg, the liberals
will meet at the beginning of May in Moscow, and the radicals at the same time
in St. Petersburg. Government circles are said to regard universal suffrage by
secret ballot as equivalent to “the proclamation of the
republic”. The “radicals” are the most numerous of all
the parties.


Bulygin’s project is, to all appearances, the project of the conservative
party. The project of the Osvobozhdeniye camp is very similar to the
programme of the “radical or constitutional” party (in reality, not
at all radical and but poorly constitutional). Finally, the
“liberal”, or Shipov, party probably wants a little more than is
offered by Bulygin and a little less than is demanded by the
constitutionalists.


The market-place is having a great day .The bargaining is brisk. The fine
gentlemen of society are standing out for a high price and so are the cunning
gentlemen of the Court. Everything points to the two of them knocking a bit off
and then—striking a bargain, before the workers and peasants step in.


The government is playing a deep game. It threatens the conservatives with the
liberals; it threatens the liberals

    

with the Osvobozhdeniye “radicals”; it threatens
the last-named with the spectre of a republic. Translated into the
language of class
interests, particularly of the chief interest— exploitation of the
workers by the bourgeoisie— this game means: Let us come to terms, my dear
landlords and merchants; let us divide the power peaceably, in bonds of harmony,
before it is too late, before the real popular revolution sets in, before we
have the rising of the whole proletariat and the whole peasantry, who will not
swallow skimpy constitutions, indirect elections, or any other bureaucratic
rubbish.


The class-conscious proletariat must have no illusions. The only pledge of
Russia’s real emancipation from the entire serf-holding, absolutist system lies
in it alone, in the proletariat supported by the peasantry, in the armed
uprising of the two, in their desperate struggle under the slogan of
“Death or freedom”.

Fortnightly reports by all the Party organisations, especially all
the workers’ Party organisations, would contribute greatly towards
consolidating the membership and the organisational unity of the Party,
particularly towards read justing the Party’s representation (at congresses) in
conformity with the number of the organised workers.


The Central Organ of the Party could publish extracts from these reports which
would serve as valuable material on the actual and genuine state of affairs in
the Party.


The number of members in the study circles, groups, etc., could also be
published by using one or two letters of the alphabet to denote this or that
group or organisation. Such reports concerning the membership of our Party
organisations would serve as useful material for control. (The objection that
they would occupy too much space is groundless. With two letters and two figures
to show the number of members—e.g., ab 13, cd 41, ef 17,
etc.— we would have eleven such reports to each line of column
space.)


The Congress should break up the interval between the Third and Fourth
Congresses (one year) into two parts. During the first half, every
Party organisation down to the lowest workers’ unit of our Party should
constitute itself and arrange without fail regular contact with the
centre and the regular submission of fortnightly reports. I say
“arrange”, because it is not enough to take the address and write;
it is necessary to check the addresses, to make sure

    

that the reports are delivered, etc., etc. Four to

     five months[1]

is quite
sufficient for organising this new practice of fortnightly reports with full
regularity. Without a doubt, given the will, this could be done in a
third of the time.


After that, in the second half-year, the fortnightly reports of the Party
organisations could be placed on a constitutional basis, so to speak, i.e.,
they would be used directly to readjust the Party’s representation at the Fourth
Congress. Thus, let us say, the Third Congress decides in April 1905 that only
Party organisations submitting the regular fort-nightly reports to the centre
as of September 1, 1905, shall be entitled to consideration in the readjusted
Party representation for the Fourth Congress. The Party’s representation at
congresses pro rata to the number of workers organised in Social-Democratic
leagues in each area will be deter mined at the Fourth Congress only on the
basis of these reports for a period of not less than three months (a minimum of
six reports). The number of members, therefore, must be given in each report.

 

Notes
 

[1]

During this period every organisation should submit its cipher
(two or three letters=name of the organisation) to the centre and achieve
the publication of at least one of its reports in the Central Organ, so
that all the members of that organisation may convince themselves of its
connection with the centre.—Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was held in London between April
12 and 27 (April 25 and May 10), 1905. The Congress was



organised and convened by the Bolsheviks under the direction of Lenin. It was
      the first Bolshevik congress.


The agenda, drawn up by Lenin and approved by the Congress, consisted of the
following items: (I) Report of the Organising Committee. (II)
Questions of Tactics:

1) the armed uprising;

2) attitude towards the
government’s policy on the eve and at the moment of the revolution (this point
was devoted to two questions: a. attitude towards the government’s policy on
the eve of the revolution b. the provisional revolutionary
government);

3)
attitude towards the peasant movement. (III) Organisational Questions:

4) relations between workers and intellectuals in the Party organisations;

5) the Party Rules. (IV) Attitude Towards Other Parties and Trends:

6) attitude towards the breakaway group of the R.S.D.L.P.;

7) attitude towards
   the non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations;

8) attitude towards the
   liberals;

9) practical agreements with the Socialists-Revolutionaries. (V)
   Internal Questions of Party Life:

10) propaganda and agitation. (VI) Delegates’ Reports:

11) report of
    the Central Committee;

12) reports of the delegates of the local
    committees. (VII) Elections:

13) elections;

14) procedure for publishing the resolutions and the proceedings of
    the Congress and for the
    assumption of office by the newly elected functionaries.


On all the basic issues dealt with by the Third Congress Lenin had written the
draft resolutions, which he substantiated in articles published in
Vperyod prior to the Congress. Lenin spoke at the Congress on the
question of the armed uprising, on the participation of Social-Democrats in the
provisional revolutionary government, on the attitude towards the peasant
movement, on the Party Rules, and on a number of other questions. The
proceedings of the Congress record 138 speeches and motions made by Lenin.


The Congress amended the Party Rules: a) it adopted Lenin’s wording of Clause 1;
b) it defined precisely the rights of the Central Committee and its relations
with the local committees; c) it modified the organisational structure of the
Party’s central bodies: in place of the three centres (the Central Committee,
the Central Organ, and the Council of the Party) the Congress established a
single competent party centre—the Central Committee.


On the work and the significance of the Third Party Congress
see Lenin’s article “The Third Congress” (pp. 442-49 of this volume)
and his book Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic
Revolution.

## Validity of the Congress









Lenin: 1905/3rdcong: Speech on the Validity of the Congress







V. I.  

      Lenin
The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
April 12 (25)-April 27 (May 10), 1905



    
 
    

1
Speech on the Validity of the Congress
April 13 (26)

I wish to reply to the remarks made here concerning the validity of the
convocation of this Congress. The Central Committee considered the Congress to
be unauthorised. The C.C. has characterised its own message to the Party Council
as “repentant”. But was there anything for the C.C. to repent? The
Congress is perfectly valid. It could, admittedly, be held invalid according to
the letter of the Rules, but it would be grotesque formalism on our
part to give the Rules such an interpretation. According to the spirit of the
Rules, the validity of the Congress is beyond question. The Party Council exists
for the Party, and not the Party for the Council. At the Second Congress, in
connection with the Organising Committee incident, it was pointed out, by none
other than Comrade Plekhanov, that discipline with regard to a lower body yields
precedence to discipline with regard to a higher body. The C.C. declared its
readiness to submit to the Party Council, if the latter would submit to the
Party, viz., to the Congress. This was a perfectly legitimate demand, yet the
Party Council rejected it. But the C.C., we are told, began to doubt the loyalty
of the Party Council and expressed its lack of confidence in it. However, as we
know, in all constitutionally governed countries the citizens have a right to
express their lack of confidence in any public servant or institution. This is
their inalienable right. Finally, even if the C.C. acted unwarrantedly, did that
give the Party Council the right also to act unwarrantedly? What guarantee is
there that the clause in the Rules which puts the Party Council under obligation
to call a congress upon its endorsement

    

 by half the qualified votes will actually be enforced? The Rules of the
      German Social-Democratic Party contain a clause authorising the Control
      Commission to convene a congress, if the

  Vorstand[1]

refuses to do
    so. We have no such provision, and it rests entirely with the Party to
    ensure that the Congress is convened. From the spirit of the Rules, and even
    from their letter, if taken as a whole, it is clear that the Party Council
    is the agent of the Party committees. The agent of the committees refuses to
    do the bidding of its principals. If the agent does not carry out the will
    of the Party, the only thing left for the Party is to execute its will
    itself. The Party committees not only had the right to call the Congress
    themselves, but were in duty bound to do so. I maintain that the Congress
    was convened in a perfectly legitimate way. Who is the judge in
    this dispute between the Party Council and the committees? Why,
    these very
    committees, the Party. The will of the Party was expressed long ago. All the
    delay and procrastination on the part of the centres abroad could not alter
    it. The commit tees were obligated to convene the Congress themselves, and
    the Congress has been convened lawfully.


Now, to meet Comrade Tigrov’s point. Comrade Tigrov says we ought not to judge
the Party Council. But the whole report of the Organising Committee is a
judgement of the Party Council. I think Comrade Tigrov errs in holding that we
must not judge the accused in absentia. In politics one is constantly
compelled to judge in absentia. Do we not constantly judge the
Socialists-Revolutionaries, the Bundists, and others in our writings, at our
meetings, and everywhere? What else can we do but judge in absentia, if
the Party Council refuses to appear at the Congress? In that case we could never
judge anyone. Even the official court judges in absentia if the accused
refuses to appear before it.

## Qualifiedness of the Kazan and Kuban

The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
April 12 (25)-April 27 (May 10), 1905

Speech on the Qualifiedness of the Kazan and Kuban
Committees
April 14 (27)

The findings of the Credentials Committee show that the Party is represented by
a total number of 75 votes, so that our Congress, as now constituted, must
beyond a doubt be recognised as valid. Considering the present attitude of
suspicion towards the Congress, we must recognise as commendable the
“liberal” tendency of the Credentials Committee to confirm the
largest possible number of committees in order to increase the lawful majority
necessary for the Congress. From this angle I am even ready to express my
sympathy with such “liberality”. But, on the other hand, one must be
equally careful and impartial towards all, and for that reason I feel
constrained to oppose the Credentials Committee’s confirmation of the Kazan and
Kuban committees. They are included in the list of qualified committees
published in issue No. 89 of Iskra, but not in the list recorded in the
minutes of the Party Council. At the Council session Comrade Martov read the
list of qualified committees valid until September 1, 1904.


(An excerpt from the minutes of the Party Council follows):



“Martov reads his resolution: According to Clause 2 of the Rules, the Party
Council is obligated to convene a congress when this is demanded by Party
organisations commanding aggregately at least half the total voting strength of
the congress. According to Note I to Clause 3, only organisations duly confirmed
after the adoption of the Party Rules shall be entitled to representation at a
congress.


“Organisations not represented at the Second Congress are to be considered
confirmed, if their confirmation by the C.C. was accorded

    

not later than one year prior to the Congress. (I) The Party Council resolves
      that ally organisation which shall have been confirmed within the
      specified period of time shall be entitled to have its vote counted at the
      computation of the number of organisations that have gone on record in
      favour of convening the Congress. The organisations represent ed at the
      Second Congress and elected by it shall be considered qualified
      organisations. (II) In view of this, only the following organisations
      shall hereafter and until September 1904 be entitled to vote on the
      question of convening a congress: (1) the C.C.; (2) the Central Organ; (3)
      the League Abroad; (4-20) the committees of St. Petersburg, Moscow,
      Kharkov, Kiev, Odessa, Nikolayev, of the Don region, of Ekaterinoslav,
      Saratov, Ufa (now the Ural region), of the North, of Tula, Tver,
      Nizhni-Novgorod, Baku, Batum, and Tiflis (until the expiration of one
      year from the time of the confirmation of the Caucasian League); (21-23)
      the League of the Mining and Metal District (Donets), and the Siberian and
      the Crimean leagues.


“The qualifledness of these organisations assumed, the number of votes they
are entitled to cast at the Congress is 46. With the 5 votes of the Party
Council members, the total voting strength of the Congress is 51; therefore, to
convene a congress 26 votes are required, viz., the votes of 13 of the
above-named qualified organisations. The C.C. is requested to furnish the Party
Council with the dates of its confirmation of the new committees since the
Congress.”



The first part of the resolution was adopted unanimously.


Later in his speech at that meeting, Comrade Glebov read out a list of the
newly-formed committees.


Comrade Glebov’s speech (from the minutes of the Party Council):


“I agree with Comrade Martov and would like to state that the following
new committees have been organised: Smolensk and Astrakhan, confirmed in
September 1903; Voronezh (the Fund for the Struggle), in January 1904; Biga, in
January; Polesye, in April; North-Western, in April; Kursk, in January;
Orel-Bryansk, in September 1903; Samara, in September 1903; Ural (Ufa), in
April.”



These facts were made public in Comrade Orlovsky’s pamphlet The Council
Against the Party, and so far the Council has neither refuted them nor
published the dates of the confirmation of the committees under dispute, which
would seem to indicate that there is no evidence of such confirmation. At the
stated meeting of the Party Council, Comrade Martov declared in one of his
speeches that in his opinion two more committees were to be confirmed in August,
namely, the Kremenchug and Poltava committees—but again not a word about
the Kazan and Kuban committees.

 

After the July declaration, Comrade Glebov sent me the full minutes of the
C.C. meetings, in which no reference is made to the confirmation of either the
Kazan or the Kuban Committee; at subsequent C.C. meetings, as Comrade
Letnev,[1]

a member of the C.C., has testified, there was like wise no mention of
their confirmation. True, Comrade Zimin,[2]

a member of the C.C., has a hazy
recollection of the Kazan and Kuban committees having been confirmed, but he can
state nothing definite.


The Credentials Committee’s decision to recognise these committees as qualified
on the evidence of their having functioned for over a year, is not correct, and
I move, therefore, that these committees be declared non-qualified.

Draft Resolution on the Attitude of the R.S.D.L.P.
Towards the Armed Uprising

1. Whereas the proletariat, being, by virtue of its position, the foremost and
   most consistent revolutionary class, is therefore called upon to play the
   role of leader and guide of the general democratic revolutionary movement in
   Russia;


2. Whereas only the performance of this role during the revolution will ensure
   the proletariat the most advantageous position in the ensuing struggle for
   socialism against the propertied classes of the bourgeois-democratic Russia
   about to be born; and


 3. Whereas the proletariat can perform this role only if it is
 organised under the banner of Social-Democracy in to an independent
 political force and if it acts in strikes and demonstrations with the
 fullest possible unity;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the
 R.S.D.L.P. resolves that the task of organising the forces of the
 proletariat for direct struggle against the autocracy by means of
 mass political strikes and the armed uprising, and of setting up for
 this purpose an apparatus for information and leadership, is one of
 the chief tasks of the Party at the present revolutionary moment;
 for which reason the Congress instructs both the C.C. and the local
 committees and leagues to start preparing the political mass strike
 as well as the organisation of special groups for the obtainment and
 distribution of arms, for the elaboration of a plan of the armed up
 rising and the direct leadership of the rising. The fulfilment of
 this task can and should proceed in such a way as will not only not
 in the least prejudice the general work of awakening the
 class-consciousness of the proletariat, but, on the contrary, will
 render that work more effective and successful.

Draft Resolution of the Armed Uprising

The Congress holds, on the basis of the practical experiences of the
functionaries and on the basis of the mood of the working-class masses, that
preparations for the uprising imply, not only the preparation of weapons, the
formation of groups, etc., but also the accumulation of experience by means of
practical attempts at separate armed actions, such as attacks by armed squads on
the police and on troops during public meetings, or on prisons, government
offices, etc. While fully relying on the local Party centres and on the C.C. to
determine the limits of such actions and the most convenient occasions for them,
while fully relying on the comrades’ discretion in avoiding a useless
expenditure of effort on petty acts of terror, the Congress draws the attention
of all Party organisations to the need for taking into consideration the
above-mentioned facts of experience.

Speech on the Question of the Armed Uprising
April 15 (28)

It has been said here that the question is clear enough in
principle. Nevertheless, statements have been made in Social-Democratic
literature (see Iskra, No. 62, and Comrade Axelrod’s foreword to the
pamphlet by “A Worker”) which go to show that the question is not so clear
after all. Iskra and Axelrod talked about conspiracy and expressed the
fear that too much thought would be given to the

up rising. 

The facts show,
however, that there has been too little thought on the subject.... In his
foreword to the pamphlet by “A Worker”, Comrade Axelrod maintains
that it can only be a question of an uprising of the “uncivilised
masses”. Events have shown that we are dealing, not with an uprising of
the “uncivilised masses”, but with an uprising of politically
conscious masses capable of carrying on an organised struggle. The entire
history of the past year proved that we underestimated the significance and the
inevitability of the uprising. Attention must be paid to the practical aspect of
the matter. In this respect the experience of those engaged in practical work
and of the workers of St. Petersburg, Riga, and the Caucasus is of exceptional
importance. I would suggest, therefore, that the comrades tell us of their
experience; that will make our discussion practical instead of academic. We
must ascertain the mood of the proletariat—whether the workers consider
themselves fit to struggle and to lead the struggle. We must sum up this
collective experience, from which no generalised conclusions have as yet been
drawn.

Speech on the Question of the Armed Uprising
April 16 (29)

During the debate the question was put on a practical plane: what is the mood of
the masses? Comrade Leskov[1]

was right in saying that it was
chequered. But Comrade Zharkov is right, too, in saying that we must reckon with
the fact that the uprising, whatever we may think of it, is bound to take
place. The question arises whether there are any differences in principle
between the resolutions submitted. I fail totally to see any. Although I am
viewed as an arch-intransigent, I will, nevertheless, try to reconcile and bring
these two resolutions into line—I will undertake their reconciliation. I
have nothing against the amendment to Comrade Voinov’s resolution. Nor do I see
any difference in principle in the addendum. Very energetic participation does
not necessarily imply hegemony. I think Comrade Mikhailov expressed himself in
a more positive manner; he emphasises hegemony, and in a concrete form, too. The
English proletariat is destined to bring about a socialist revolution—that
is beyond doubt; but its inability to bring it about at the present moment,
owing to its lack of socialist organisation and its corruption by the
bourgeoisie, is equally beyond dispute. Comrade Voinov expresses the same
thought: the most energetic participation is undoubtedly the most decisive
participation. Whether the proletariat will decide the outcome of the
revolution—no one can assert absolutely. This is likewise true of the role
of leader. Comrade Voinov’s resolution is worded more carefully. Social
Democracy may organise the uprising, it may even be the deciding factor in
it. But whether Social-Democracy will

    

have the leading role in it cannot be predetermined; that will depend on the
      strength and organisation of the proletariat. The petty bourgeoisie may
      be better organised and its diplomats may prove to be superior and better
      trained. Comrade Voinov is the more cautious; he says, “You may be
      able to do it.” “You will do it,” says Comrade Mikhailov. The
      proletariat may possibly decide the outcome of the revolution, but this
      cannot be asserted positively. Comrades Mikhailov and Sosnovsky are guilty
      of the very error they charge Comrade Voinov with: “Count not your
      trophies before the battle.”


“For guarantee, it is necessary,” says Voinov; “necessary and
sufficient,” say Mikhailov and Sosnovsky. As to organising special fighting
groups, I might say that I consider them necessary. We need not fear to form
them.

April 12 (25)-April 27 (May 10), 1905

Resolution on the Armed Uprising[1]

1. Whereas the proletariat being, by virtue of its position, the foremost and
   only consistently revolutionary class, is therefore called upon to play the
   leading role in the general democratic revolutionary movement in Russia;


2. Whereas this movement at the present time has already led to the necessity of
   an armed uprising;


3. Whereas the proletariat will inevitably take the most energetic part in this
   uprising, which participation will decide the destiny of the revolution in
   Russia;


4. Whereas the proletariat can play the leading role in this revolution only if
   it is united, in a single and independent political force under the banner
   of the Social-Democratic Labour Party, which directs its struggle both
   ideologically and practically; and


 5. Whereas only’ the performance of this role will ensure to the
 proletariat the most advantageous conditions for the struggle for
 socialism against the propertied classes of bourgeois-democratic
 Russia;—


Therefore, the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. holds
 that the task of organising the proletariat for direct struggle
 against the autocracy by means of the armed uprising is one of the
 major and most urgent tasks of the Party at the present revolutionary
 moment.


Accordingly, the Congress instructs all Party organisations:


a) to explain to the proletariat by means of propaganda and agitation, not only
the political significance, but the practical organisational aspect of the
impending armed up rising.

 

b) to explain in that propaganda and agitation the role of mass political
strikes, which may be of great importance
at the beginning and during the progress of the uprising, and


c) to take the most energetic steps towards arming the proletariat, as well as
drawing up a plan of the armed up rising and of direct leadership thereof, for
which purpose special groups of Party workers should be formed as and when
necessary.

Speech on the Attitude Towards the Government’s Tactics on the
Eve of the Revolution
April 18 (May 1)

We are in a quandary. We have three resolutions and three amendments. The
resolutions are growing in number and scope, and this process is not being
regulated in any way. The subject has proved to be broader than the speaker who
made the report anticipated. We shall have to refer the resolution back to the
committee, although Comrade Sergeyev[1]

evidently
ridicules this proposal. The question of open action was touched upon by all the
speakers. The report was appropriate to the subject, but needs amplifying. On
the question of participation in the societies opinion is divided. The Congress
cannot lay down a hard and fast rule on this point. All methods should be used
for agitation. The experience of the Shidlovsky Commission gives no grounds
whatever for a downright negative attitude. Some say that there is nothing new
in the resolution. A good thing bears repeating again and again. Comrade Zimin’s
view is too rigid. It is impossible to reply categorically whether it is
advisable to participate. in the Zemsky Sobor. Everything will depend on the
political situation, on the electoral system, and on other specific factors
which cannot be estimated in advance. Some say that the Zemsky Sobor is a
fraud. That is true. But there are times when we must take part in elections to
expose a fraud. We can give nothing more than a general directive. I repeat, in
my opinion all the resolutions should be referred back to the committee, the
membership of which should be enlarged.

Could we not satisfy Comrade Alexandrov[1]

with the following amendments to Schmidt’s[2]

resolution (roughly):


1) instead of (the Congress) “resolves”: the Congress con
firms the old tactics of the Social-Democrats as laid down at the Second
Congress, with a detailed explanation applicable to the present moment (or
something of the kind);


2) to add another clause to the resolution approximately as follows:


As regards the actual and sham concessions which the weakened autocracy is now
making to the democrats in general and to the working class in particular, the
Social-Democratic party of the working class should take advantage
of them in order, on the one hand, to consolidate for the people
every improvement in the economic conditions and every extension of liberties
with a view to intensifying the struggle, and on the other, steadily to expose
before the proletariat the reactionary aims of the government, which is trying
to disunite and corrupt the working class and draw its attention away from its
urgent class needs at the moment of the revolution.

10
Draft Resolution on the Question of Open Political Action by the
R.S.D L.P.

1. Whereas the revolutionary movement in Russia has already to a certain degree
shaken and disorganised the autocratic government, which has been compelled to
tolerate the comparatively extensive exercise of freedom of political action by
the classes inimical to it;


2. Whereas this freedom of political action is mostly, almost exclusively,
   enjoyed by the bourgeois classes, which thereby strengthen their existing
   economic and political domination over the working class and increase the
   danger that the proletariat may be transformed into a mere append age of
   bourgeois democracy; and


3. Whereas there is developing (breaking through, coining to light) among
   increasingly wider masses of the workers the urge towards independent open
   action in the political arena, even though (on occasions of lesser
   importance) with out the participation of the Social-Democrats;—
   Therefore, the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. calls
the attention of all Party organisations to the fact that it is necessary


a) to make use of each and every case of open political action on the part of
the educated spheres and the people, whether in the press, in associations, or
at meetings, for the purpose of contraposing the independent class demands of
the proletariat to the general democratic demands, so as to develop its
class-consciousness and to organise it in the course of such actions into an
independent socialist force;


b) to make use of all legal and semi-legal channels for creating workers’
societies, associations, and organisations,

    

and to put forward every effort towards securing (in

what ever 

way) the
      predominance of Social-Democratic influence in such associations and to
      convert them into bases for the future openly functioning
      Social-Democratic working-class party in Russia;


c) to take the necessary steps to ensure that our Party organisations, while
maintaining and developing their underground machinery, will proceed at once to
the preparation of expedient forms of transition, wherever and whenever
possible, to open Social-Democratic activity, even to the point of clashes with
the armed forces of the government.

11
Draft Resolution on the Participation of the Social-Democrats in
a Provisional Revolutionary Government

1. Whereas a really free and open mass struggle of the
proletariat against the bourgeoisie requires the widest possible political
liberty and, consequently, the fullest possible realisation of republican forms
of government;


2. Whereas various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sections of the population,
   the peasantry, etc., are, now coming out in increasing numbers with
   revolutionary-democratic slogans, which are the natural and inevitable
   expression of the basic needs of the masses, the satisfaction of which—
   impossible under the autocracy—has been made imperative by the
   objective development of the entire socio-economic life of Russia;


3. Whereas international revolutionary Social-Democracy has always recognised
   that the proletariat must render most energetic support to the revolutionary
   bourgeoisie in its struggle against all reactionary classes and
   institutions, provided that the party of the proletariat maintain absolute
   independence and a strictly critical attitude towards its temporary allies;


4. Whereas the overthrow of the autocratic government in Russia is inconceivable
   without its replacement by a provisional revolutionary government, and
   whereas only such a change can ensure real freedom and a true expression of
   the will of the whole people during the inauguration of the new political
   system in Russia and guarantee the realisation of our programme of immediate
   and direct political and economic changes;

 

5. Whereas without the replacement of the autocratic government by a provisional
   revolutionary government sup ported by all revolutionary-democratic classes
   and class elements in Russia, it will be impossible to achieve a republican
   form of government and win over to the revolution the backward and
   undeveloped sections of the proletariat and particularly of the
   peasantry—those sections whose interests are completely opposed to the
   absolutist, serf-holding order and which cling to the autocracy or stand
   apart from the struggle against it largely on account of the oppressive
   stupefying atmosphere; and


6. Whereas with the existence in Russia of a Social-Democratic party of the
   working class, which, though only in the initial stage of its development, is
   nevertheless already organised and capable, particularly under conditions of
   political freedom, of controlling and directing the actions of its delegates
   in a provisional revolutionary government, the danger that these delegates
   may deviate from the correct class line is not
   insurmountable;—


   Therefore, the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. holds
that representatives of the Party may participate in the provisional
revolutionary government for the purpose of relentlessly combating, together
with the revolutionary bourgeois democrats, all attempts at counter-revolution,
and of defending the independent class interests of the proletariat, provided
that the Party maintain strict control over its representatives and firmly
safeguard the independence of the Social-Democratic Labour Party, which aims at
the complete socialist revolution and is in this respect hostile to all
bourgeois-democratic parties and classes.

Another argument in favour of participating in a provisional revolutionary
government:


Whereas the categorical refusal to participate in a provisional revolutionary

inevitably dooms the activity of the revolutionary proletariat aimed at
preparing, organising, and carrying out the armed uprising, to irresolution,
half-way policies, and disunity;—

Report on the Question of the Participation of the
Social-Democrats in a Provisional Revolutionary Government
April 18 (May 1)

My task is to present the question of the participation of the Social-Democrats
in a provisional revolutionary government. It may seem strange, at first
glance, that such a question should have arisen. One might think the cause of
Social-Democracy to be thriving and the probability of its participation in a
provisional revolutionary government to be very great. Actually it is not so. To
debate this question as an immediately realisable prospect would be
quixotic. But the question has been forced upon us not so much by the actual
state of affairs as by literary polemics. It must always be borne in mind that
the question was first raised by Martynov, and that he raised it before
January 9. He wrote in his pamphlet Two Dictatorships (pp. 10-11):



“Imagine, dear reader, for a moment, that Lenin’s utopia has been realised;
imagine that the Party, whose membership has been narrowed down to only
professional revolutionaries, has succeeded in ’preparing, timing, and
carrying out the general armed uprising of the people’. Is it not obvious that
it would be this Party which would he designated as the provisional
government by the will of the whole people immediately after the revolution? Is it
not obvious that the people would place the immediate fate of the revolution in
the hands of this Party, and no other? Is it not obvious that this Party, not
wishing to betray the confidence previously placed in it by the people, would
he forced, he in duty bound, to assume power and maintain it until it
had consolidated the victory of the revolution by revolutionary measures?”



Incredible as it may seem, this is actually how the question is presented:
Martynov believes that if we were thoroughly

    

 to prepare and launch the uprising, we should find our selves in a
desperate predicament. If we were to submit our dispute to a foreigner, he would
never believe it possible for the question to be formulated in that manner and
he would not understand us. Our dispute cannot be understood without a knowledge
of the history of Russian Social-Democratic views and the nature of the
tail-endist views of Rabocheye Dyelo. This question has become an
urgent question of theory and must be clarified. It is a question of clarity in
our aims. I urge the comrades when reporting on our discussion to the members
engaged in practical Party work in Russia to emphasise strongly Martynov’s
formulation of the question.


Iskra, No. 96, contains an article by Plekhanov. We have always held
Plekhanov in great esteem for the “of fence” he has repeatedly given
to the opportunists, which, to his honour, has earned him a mass of enemies. But
we cannot esteem him for defending Martynov. This is not the Plekhanov we
knew. He entitles his article “On the Question of the Seizure of
Power”. This artificially narrows the issue. We have never thus presented
the question. Plekhanov presents things as though Vperyod called Marx
and Engels “virtuosi of philistinism”. But that is not so; it is a
slight substitution. Vperyod expressly stressed the correctness of
Marx’s general conception of this question. The charge of philistinism referred
to Martynov or to L. Martov. Well disposed though we are to hold in high esteem
all who collaborate with Plekhanov, it must be said, however, that Martynov is
not Marx. Plekhanov errs in seeking to hush up Martynovism.


Martynov asserts that if we take a decisive part in the uprising, we shall be
in great danger of being forced by the proletariat to take power. This argument
has a certain original logic of its own, although a logic of retreat. It is in
reference to this peculiar warning against the danger of victory in the
struggle against the autocracy that Vperyod asks Martynov and L. Martov
what they are talking about: a socialist or a democratic dictatorship? We are
referred to Engels’ famous words about the danger involved in the position of a
leader who has been given power in behalf of a class that is not yet mature for
the exercise of complete domination. We explained in Vperyod that
Engels points out the danger to the position of a leader when he establishes

    

post factum a divergence between principle and reality, between words
    and facts. Such a divergence leads to disaster in the sense of political
    failure, not in the sense of physical

defeat[1]

;

you must affirm (this is
    Engels’ thought) that the revolution is socialistic, when it is really only
    democratic. If we promised the Russian proletariat now that we could secure
    its complete domination immediately, we would fall into the error of the
    Socialists-Revolutionaries. It is this mistake of the
    Socialists-Revolutionaries that we Social-Democrats have always
    ridiculed—their claim that the revolution will be “democratic
    and not bourgeois”. We have constantly said that the revolution would
    strengthen the bourgeoisie, not weaken it, but that it would create for the
    proletariat the necessary conditions for waging a successful struggle for
    socialism.


But since it is a question of a democratic revolution, we are faced with two
forces: the autocracy and the revolutionary people, viz., the proletariat as
the chief combatant, and the peasantry and all the different petty-bourgeois
elements. The interests of the proletariat do not coincide with those of the
peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie. Social-Democracy has always stressed, the
fact that these class differences in the midst of a revolutionary people are
unavoidable. In a hard-fought struggle, the object of the struggle may change
from hand to hand. A revolutionary people strives for the sovereignty of the
people; all the reactionary elements defend the sovereignty of the tsar. A
successful revolution, therefore, cannot be anything but the democratic
dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, whose interests, equally
opposed to the sovereignty of the tsar, coincide. Both Iskra
and Vperyod are agreed on the slogan “To march separately but
strike together”, but Vperyod adds that striking jointly means
jointly striking the final blow and jointly beating off the enemy’s attempts to
recover the ground he has lost. After the overthrow of the autocracy, the
struggle will not cease, but become more intense. That is precisely the time
when the reactionary forces will organise for the struggle in real earnest. If
we are going to employ the slogan of the uprising, we must not frighten the

    

Social-Democrats with the possibility of victory in the uprising. When we have
won the sovereignty of the people, we shall have to consolidate it—this is
what is meant by the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship. We have no reason
whatever to fear it. The establishment of the republic would be a tremendous
victory for the proletariat, although, unlike the bourgeois revolutionary, the
Social-Democrat does not regard the republic as the “absolute ideal”
but merely as some thing that will guarantee him freedom to wage the struggle
for socialism on a broad basis. Parvus says that in no other country has the
struggle for freedom entailed such tremendous sacrifices. This is true. It is
confirmed by the European bourgeois press, which is following events in Russia
very closely from the outside. The autocracy’s resistance to the most elementary
reforms is incredibly strong, and the greater the action the greater the
counter-action. Hence the autocracy’s utter collapse is highly probable. The
entire question of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship hinges on the
complete overthrow of the autocracy. Possibly the history of 1848-50 will repeat
itself with us, that is, the autocracy will not be overthrown but only limited
in power and converted into a constitutional monarchy. In that case a democratic
dictatorship will be out of the question. If, however, the autocratic government
is really over thrown, it will have to be replaced by another. This other can be
only a provisional revolutionary government. It can base itself for support only
on the revolutionary people—on the proletariat and the peasantry. It can
be only a dictatorship, that is, not an organisation of “order”, but
an organisation of war. If you are storming a fortress, you cannot discontinue
the war even after you have taken the fortress. Either the one or the other:
either we take the fortress to hold it, or we do not storm the fortress and
explain that all we want is a little place next to it.


Let me pass on to Plekhanov. His method is totally incorrect. He evades
important questions of principle to indulge in quibbling, with an element of
misstatement. (Exclamation by Comrade Barsov: “Hear, hear!”)
Vperyod maintains that Marx’s general scheme is correct (that of
replacing the autocracy first by a bourgeois monarchy and then by a
petty-bourgeois democratic republic); but if we set out

    

beforehand to restrict the limits to which we shall go in accordance with this
      scheme, we shall prove ourselves philistines. Thus, Plekhanov’s defence of
      Marx is verlorene Liebesmühe (love’s labour’s lost). In
    defending Martynov, Plekhanov refers to the Address[3]

of the Central Committee of the Communist League[4]

to the League membership. Plekhanov
    misstates this Address too. He draws a veil over the fact that it was
    written at a time when the people had failed to score a complete victory,
    notwithstanding the victorious uprising of the Berlin proletariat in
    1848. Absolutism had been superseded by a bourgeois constitutional monarchy,
    and, consequently, a provisional government backed by the entire
    revolutionary people was out of the question. The whole point of the Address
    is that after the failure of the popular uprising Marx advises the working
    class to organise and prepare. Can

thEse 

counsels serve to clarify the
    situation in Russia before the uprising has begun? Can they resolve the moot
    question which presupposes the victorious uprising of the proletariat? The
    Address begins thus: “In the two revolutionary years 1848-49 the
    League proved itself in double fashion: first, in that its members
    energetically took part in the movement in all places.... The League further
    proved itself in that its conception of the movement [as set forth, by the
    way, in the Communist Manifesto] turned out to be the only correct
    one.... At the same time, the former firm organisation of the League was
    considerably slackened. A large part of the members who directly
    participated in the revolutionary movement believed the time for
    secret societies to have gone by and public activities alone
    sufficient. The individual
    circles and communities allowed their connections with the Central
    Committee (Zentralbehörde) to be come loose and gradually
    dormant. Consequently, while the democratic party, the party of the
      petty bourgeoisie, organised itself more and more in Germany, the
      workers’ party lost its only firm hold, remained organised at the
    most in separate localities for local purposes and in the
    general movement (in der aligemeinen Bewegung) thus came
    completely under the
      domination and leadership of the petty-bourgeois democrats”
      (Ansprache, p. 75).


Thus, Marx found in 1850 that the petty-bourgeois democrats had gained in
organisation during the Revolution of

    

1848, which had run its course, while the workers’ party had lost. Naturally,
Marx’s chief concern was that the workers’ party should not lag behind the
bourgeoisie a second time. It is “extremely important that ... precisely
at this moment, when a new revolution is impending, the workers’ party must act
in the most organised, most unanimous and most independent fashion possible, if
it is not to be exploited and taken in tow again by the bourgeoisie as in 1848”
(An sprache, p. 76).


It is because the bourgeois democrats were better organised that Marx did not
doubt that they would definitely predominate, should a second revolution take
place at once. “That, during the further development of the revolution,
the petty-bourgeois democracy will for a moment (für einen Augenblick)
obtain predominating influence in Germany is not open to doubt”
(Ansprache, p. 78). Taking all this into consideration, we can
understand why Marx does not mention a word in Ansprache about the
participation of the proletariat in a provisional revolutionary
government. Plekhanov, therefore, is entirely incorrect in asserting
that Marx “considered
inadmissible the thought that the political representatives of the proletariat
could work together with the representatives of the petty bourgeoisie for the
creation of a new social order” (Iskra, No. 96). This is not
correct. Marx does not raise the question of participation in
a provisional revolutionary government, whereas Plekhanov makes it
appear as though
Marx decided this question in the negative. Marx says: We
Social-Democrats have all been lagging behind, we are worse organised, we must
organise independently for the eventuality that the petty bourgeoisie will come
to power after a new revolution. From these premises of Marx, Martynov draws the
following conclusion: We Social-Democrats, now better organised than the petty-bourgeois democrats and constituting undoubtedly an in dependent party, ought to
shrink from having to participate in a provisional revolutionary
government in the event of a successful uprising. Yes! Comrade Plekhanov,
Marxism is one thing and Martynovism another. To bring out more clearly the
great difference between the situation in Russia in 1905 and that in Germany in
1850, let us deal with some further interesting passages in the Address. Marx
did not

    

even mention the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat, for he believed in
      the direct socialist dictatorship of the proletariat immediately after the
      petty-bourgeois revolution. On the agrarian question, for instance, he
      says that the democrats want to create a petty-bourgeois peasant class,
      but that the workers must oppose this plan in the interests of the rural
      proletariat and in their own interests; they must demand that the
      confiscated feudal landed property remain state property, and that it be
      used for labour colonies in which the associated rural proletariat should
      employ all the means of large-scale agriculture. Obviously, with such
      plans in mind, Marx could not speak of a democratic dictatorship. He wrote, not on the eve of the revolution, as the representative
    of the organised proletariat, but after the revolution, as the
    representative of the workers in the process of organising. Marx emphasises
    the first task as follows: “After the overthrow of the existing
    governments, the Central Committee will, as soon as it is at all possible,
    betake itself to Germany, immediately convene a congress, and put before
    the latter the necessary proposals for the centralisation of the workers’
    clubs....” Thus, the idea of an independent workers’ party, which has become
    with us bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh, was then something new. We
    must not forget that in 1848, when Marx was editing the free and extremely
    revolutionary newspaper (Die Neue Rheinische
      Zeitung[5]),

    he had no working-class organisation behind him. His paper was
    supported by bourgeois radicals, who nearly wrecked it when Marx made his
    scathing attack on the Paris bourgeoisie after the June Days. That is why
    the Address has so much to say about the independent organisation of the
    workers. It deals with the formation of revolutionary workers’ governments
    parallel with the new official government, whether in the form of workers’
    clubs and committees or of local communal councils and municipalities. The
    point made therein is that the workers should be armed and that they should
    form an independent workers’ guard. The second clause in the programme
    states that working-class candidates, preferably members of the League,
    should be nominated for these bodies alongside the bourgeois candidates. How
    weak the League was is shown by the fact that Marx had to argue the need for
    nominating

    

independent candidates. The inference to be drawn from all this is that Marx did
not mention and had no intention of deciding the question of participation in a
provisional revolutionary government, since that question could have no
practical significance at the time; the entire attention was concentrated
exclusively on the organisation of an independent workers’ party.


Plekhanov says further in Iskra that Vperyod produces no
relevant evidence, but confines itself to repeating a few favourite catchwords,
and he alleges that Vperyod seeks to criticise Marx. With what truth?
Do we not see, on the contrary, that Vperyod puts the question on a
concrete basis, taking into account the real social forces engaged in Russia in
the struggle for the democratic revolution? Plekhanov, on the other hand, does
not say a word about the concrete conditions in Russia. His stock-in-trade
consists of a couple of inapposite quotations. Monstrous, but true. The
situation in Russia differs so greatly from that in Western Europe that even
Parvus was prompted to ask: Where is our revolutionary democracy? Unable to
prove that Vperyod wants to “criticise” Marx, Plekhanov
drags in Mach and Avenarius by the ears. I cannot for the life of me understand
what these writers, for whom I have not the slightest sympathy, have to do with the
question of social revolution. They wrote on individual and social organisation
of experience, or some such theme, but they never really gave any thought to the
democratic dictatorship. Does Plekhanov mean to say that Parvus, perhaps, has
become a disciple of Mach and Avenarius? (Laughter.) Or perhaps things
have come to such a pass with Plekhanov that he has to make a butt of Mach and
Avenarius without rhyme or reason. Plekhanov goes on to say that Marx and Engels
soon lost faith in an imminent social revolution. The Communist League broke
up. Petty squabbles arose among the political emigrants abroad, which Marx and
Engels put down to the fact that while there were revolutionaries there was no
revolution. Plekhanov writes in Iskra: “They [Marx and Engels,
who had lost faith in an imminent social revolution] would have formulated the
political tasks of the proletariat on the assumption that the democratic system
would be predominant for a fairly long time. But for this very reason they would
have been

    

more emphatic than ever in condemning the socialists’ participation in a
      petty-bourgeois government” (Iskra, No. 96). Why? No
    answer. Once more Plekhanov uses democratic dictatorship interchangeably
    with socialist

dictator ship, 

i.e., he falls into Martynov’s error, against
    which Vperyod has time and again strongly warned. Without the
    democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry no republic is
    possible in Russia. This assertion was made by Vperyod on the basis
    of an analysis of the actual situation. Unfortunately, Marx did not know
    this situation and he did not write of it. Therefore the analysis of this
    situation can neither be confirmed nor refuted with simple quotations from
    Marx. As to the concrete conditions, Plekhanov says not a word.


Even less felicitous is the adducing of the second quotation from Engels. For
one thing, it is rather odd of Plekhanov to refer to a private letter without
mention of the time and place of its publication.[6]

We could only be
grateful for the publication of Engels’ letters, but we should like to see their
full text. We have, however, some information which permits us to judge of the
true meaning of Engels’ letter.


We know definitely, in the second place, that the situation in Italy in the
nineties was nothing like the present situation in Russia. Italy had been
enjoying freedom for forty years. In Russia the working class cannot even
dream of such freedom without a bourgeois revolution. In Italy, consequently,
the working class had long been in a position to develop an independent
organisation for the socialist revolution. Turati is the Italian Millerand. It
is quite possible, therefore, that even at that time Turati advocated
Millerandian ideas. This assumption is borne out by the fact that, according to
Plekhanov himself, Engels had to explain to Turati the difference between a
bourgeois-democratic and a socialist revolution. Thus, Engels feared that
Turati would find himself in the false position of a leader who did not
understand the social significance of the revolution in which he was taking
part. Accordingly, we must say again of Plekhanov that he confounds democratic
with socialist revolution.


But perhaps we might find in Marx and Engels an answer which, though not
applying to the concrete situation in

    

Russia, would apply to the general principles of the revolutionary struggle of
the proletariat? Iskra at any rate raises one such general question.


It states in issue No. 93: “The best way to organise the proletariat into
a party in opposition to the bourgeois-democratic state is to develop the
bourgeois revolution from below through the pressure of the proletariat
on the democrats in power.” Iskra goes on: “Vperyod
wants the pressure of the proletariat on the revolution [?] to be exerted not
only from below, not only from the street, but also from above, from the marble
halls of the provisional government.” This formulation is correct;
Vperyod does want this. We have here a really general question of
principle: is revolutionary action permissible only from below, or also from
above? To this general question we can find an answer in Marx and Engels.


I have in mind Engels’ interesting article “The Bakuninists at
Work”[7]

(1873). Engels describes briefly the Spanish Revolution of 1873, when the
country was swept by a revolution of the Intransigentes, i.e., the extreme
republicans. Engels stresses the fact that the immediate emancipation of the
working class was out of the question at that time. The task was to accelerate
for the proletariat the transition through the preliminary stages that prepare
the social revolution and to clear the obstacles in its way. The working class
of Spain could utilise this opportunity only by taking an active part in the
revolution. In this it was hindered by the influence of the Bakuninists and,
among other things, by their idea of the general strike, which Engels criticised
so effectively. Engels describes, in passing, the events in Alcoy, a city with
30,000 factory workers, where the proletariat found itself master of the
situation. How did the proletariat act? Despite the principles of Bakuninism,
they were obligated to participate in the provisional revolutionary
government. “The Bakuninists,” says Engels, “had for years been
propagating the idea that all revolutionary action from above downward was
pernicious, and that every thing must be organised and carried out from below
upward.”


This, then, is Engels’ answer to the general question of “from above or
from below” raised by Iskra. The “Iskra” principle of
“only from below and never from above” is an anarchist
principle. Drawing his conclusion from the events of the

    

Spanish revolution, Engels says: “The Bakuninists repudiated the credo
      which they had just proclaimed: that the establishment of a revolutionary
      government was only a new deception and a new betrayal of the working
      class [as Plekhanov is trying to persuade us now], by figuring quite
      complacently on the government committees of the various cities, and at
      that almost everywhere as an impotent minority outvoted and exploited
      politically by the bourgeoisie.” Thus, what displeases Engels is the
      fact that the Bakuninists were in the minority, and not the fact that they
      sat there on these committees. At the conclusion of his pamphlet,
    Engels declares that the example of the Bakuninists is “an example of
    how not to make a revolution”.


If Martov confined his revolutionary work exclusively to action from below, he
would be repeating the mistake of the Bakuninists.


Iskra, however, after inventing differences on points of principle with
Vperyod, comes round to our own point of view. Martynov, for instance,
says that the proletariat, in common with the people, must force the bourgeoisie
to consummate the revolution. This, however, is nothing but the revolutionary
dictatorship of “the people”, viz., of the proletariat and the
peasantry. The bourgeoisie has no wish what ever to consummate the
revolution. But the people cannot help wanting this because of the social
conditions of their existence. The revolutionary dictatorship will educate them
and draw them into political life.


Iskra writes in issue No. 95:



“If, however, we should finally be swept into power against our will by the
inner dialectics of the revolution at a time when the national conditions for
the establishment of socialism are not yet mature, we would not hack out. We
would make it our aim to break down the narrow national framework of the
revolution and impel the Western world towards revolution, as France impelled
the East a century ago.”



Thus, Iskra itself admits that, were it our misfortune to be
victorious, we should have to act in keeping with the Vperyod
position. Hence, in the practical aspect of the question,
“Iskra” follows “Vperyod” and undermines its own
position. The only thing I fail to understand is how Martov and Martynov can be
dragged to power against their own will. If ever there was idiocy!

 

Iskra cites France as an example. But that was Jacobin France. To make
a bogy of Jacobinism in time of revolution is a cheap trick. A democratic
dictatorship, as I have pointed out, is not an organisation of
“order”, but an organisation of war. Even if we did seize
St. Petersburg and guillotined Nicholas, we would still have several
Vendées[8]

to deal with. Marx understood this perfectly when in 1848,
in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, he recalled the Jacobins. He said that
“the Reign of Terror of 1793 was nothing but a plebeian mariner of
settling accounts with absolutism and counter-revolution.”[9]

We,
too, prefer to settle accounts with the Russian autocracy by
“plebeian” methods and leave Girondist methods to Iskra.
The situation confronting the Russian revolution is singularly auspicious (an
anti-popular war, the Asiatic conservatism of the autocracy, etc.), and it
justifies the hope that the uprising may prove successful. The revolutionary
temper of the proletariat is mounting almost hourly. At such a moment
Martynovism is not mere folly, but a downright crime, for it saps the
revolutionary energy of the proletariat, clips the wings of its revolutionary
enthusiasm. (Lyadov: “Hear, hear!”) It is the mistake Bernstein
made in the German Party, under different circumstances, on the question, not
of the democratic, but of the socialist dictatorship.


To give you a definite idea of what these celebrated “marble halls”
of the provisional revolutionary government are really like, I shall quote still
another source. In his article “Die

  Reichsverfassungskampagne” [2]

Engels recounts how he took part in a
revolution in the precincts of these “marble halls”. He describes,
for instance, the uprising in Rhenish Prussia, which was one of the most
industrialised centres in Germany. The chances for the victory of the democratic
party, he says, were particularly strong there. The thing to do was to rush all
available forces to the right bank of the Rhine, spread the insurrection over a
wider area and try to set up the nucleus of a revolutionary army with the aid of
the Landwehr (militia). This was precisely what Engels proposed when
he went to Elberfeld to do everything possible to put his plan into
operation. He attacks the petty-bourgeois

    

 leaders for their inability to organise the insurrection, for
      their failure to furnish funds, for instance, for the maintenance of the
      workers fighting on the barricades, etc. They should have acted more
      energetically, he says. Their first step should have been to disarm the
      Elberfeld Citizens’ Army and distribute its arms among the workers,
      and then to levy a compulsory tax for the maintenance of the workers thus
      armed. But this suggestion, says Engels, came only and exclusively from
      me. The highly respectable Committee of Public Safety was not in the
      least inclined to take such “terrorist measures”.


Thus, while our Marx and Engels—that is, Martynov and Martov (Homeric
laughter)—try to frighten us with the bogy of Jacobinism, Engels
castigated the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie for its disdain of the
“Jacobin” mode of operation. He understood that going to war
and—in the course of the war—renouncing the State Treasury and
government power meant engaging in an unworthy game of words. Where, then, will
you get money for the uprising, if it becomes an all-people’s uprising,
gentlemen of the new Iskra? Not from the State Treasury, surely? That
is bourgeois! That is Jacobinism!


Concerning the uprising in Baden Engels writes that “the insurgent
government had every chance of success, in that it found ... a ready army,
well-stocked arsenals ... a full State Treasury, and what was practically solid
support of the population”. After the event everyone understood what had
to be done under the circumstances. What had to be done was to organise an army
for the protection of the National Assembly, to drive the Austrians and
Prussians back, to spread the revolt to the neighbouring states, and
“bring the trembling German so-called National Assembly under the
terroristic influence of an insurgent population and insurgent army.... It was
necessary, furthermore, to centralise the power of the insurrection, put the
necessary funds at its disposal and win for the insurrection the sympathy of the
vast farming majority of the population by immediately abolishing all feudal
burdens.... All this should have been done at once, however, if it was to be
carried out promptly. A week after the appointment of the Committee of Safety it
was too late”.

 

We are convinced that when the uprising starts in Russia the revolutionary
Social-Democrats, following the example of Engels, will enlist as soldiers of
the revolution and will give the same kind of “Jacobin” advice. But
our Iskra prefers to discuss the colour of the ballot envelopes,
relegating to the background the question of the provisional revolutionary
government and of a revolutionary guard for the Constituent Assembly. Our
Iskra will not act “from above” under any circumstances.


From Karlsruhe Engels went to Pfalz, where his friend D’Ester (who had once
freed Engels from arrest) was, on the provisional government. “Official
participation in a movement that was utterly alien to our party was plainly out
of the question in this case as well,” Engels says. He had “to take the
only position in this movement that anyone working on the Neue Rheinische
Zeitung could take: that of a soldier.” We have spoken of the break-up of
the Communist League, which deprived Engels of practically all ties with the
workers’ organisations. This clarifies the passage we quoted:
“I was offered many civilian and military posts,” writes Engels,
“posts that I would not have hesitated for a moment to accept in a
proletarian movement. Under the circumstances I declined them all.”


As we see, Engels did not fear to act from above; he did not fear that the
proletariat might become too organised and too strong, which could lead to its
participation in the provisional government. On the contrary, he regretted that
the movement was not successful enough, not proletarian enough, because the
workers were completely unorganised. But even under these circumstances, Engels
accepted a post; he served in the army as Willich’s adjutant, took over the
delivery of ammunition, transporting under the greatest difficulties powder,
lead, cartridges, etc. “To die for the republic was (thenceforward) my
aim,” writes Engels.


I leave it to you, comrades, to judge whether this picture of a provisional
government drawn according to the words of Engels resembles the “marble
halls” which the new Iskra is holding up as a bogy to frighten
the workers away from us. (Applause.) (The speaker reads
his draft of the resolution and explains it.)

Draft Resolution on the Provisional Revolutionary
Government

1. Whereas both the direct interests of the Russian proletariat and those of
its struggle for the ultimate aims of socialism require the fullest possible
measure of political freedom, and, consequently, the replacement of the
autocratic form of government by the democratic republic;


2. Whereas the armed uprising of the people, if completely successful, i.e., if
   the autocracy is overthrown, will necessarily bring about the establishment
   of a provisional revolutionary government, which alone is capable of
   securing complete freedom of agitation and of convening a Constituent
   Assembly that will really express the will of the people, an Assembly elected
   on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot; and


3. Whereas this democratic revolution in Russia will not weaken, but, on the
   contrary, will strengthen the domination of the bourgeoisie, which, at a
   certain juncture, will inevitably go to all lengths to take away from the
   Russian proletariat as many of the gains of the revolutionary period as
   possible;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. resolves:


a) that we should spread among the working class the conviction that a
provisional revolutionary government is absolutely necessary, and discuss at
workers’ meetings the conditions required for the full and prompt realisation of
all the immediate political and economic demands of our programme;


b) that in the event of the victorious uprising of the people and the complete
overthrow of the autocracy, representatives

    

of our Party may participate in the provisional revolutionary government
for the purpose of waging a relentless struggle against all
counter-revolutionary attempts and of defending the independent interests of the
working class;


c) that essential conditions for such participation are strict control of its
representatives by the Party, and the constant safeguarding of the independence
of the Social-Democratic Party, which strives for the complete socialist
revolution, and, consequently, is irreconcilably opposed to all the bourgeois
parties;


d) that, irrespective of whether participation of Social-Democrats in the
provisional revolutionary government is possible or not, we must propagate among
the broadest sections of the proletariat the idea that the armed proletariat,
led by the Social-Democratic Party, must bring to bear constant pressure on the
provisional government for the purpose of defending, consolidating, and
extending the gains of the revolution.

Speech on the Amendments to the Resolution on the Provisional
Revolutionary Government
April 19 (May 2)

On the whole I share the opinion of Comrade Zimin. It is only natural that, as
publicist, I should have given my attention to the literary formulation of the
question. Comrade Zimin has very properly stressed the importance of the aim
which our struggle pursues, and I subscribe to all he has said. You cannot fight
if you do not expect to capture the point you are fighting for....


Comrade Zimin’s amendment to Point 2: “that the establishment, etc. ... a
provisional government, which alone”, etc., is quite to the purpose, and I
readily accept it.


This is likewise true of the amendment to Point 3; it is very appropriate to
show here that under the present social and economic conditions the bourgeoisie
will of necessity grow stronger.


In point (a) of the resolution, the wording “the proletariat will
demand” is better than my formulation, since it shifts the emphasis to the
proletariat. In point (b) the reference to the dependence on the relation of
forces is also quite appropriate. This formulation, in my opinion, renders
Comrade Andreyev’s amendment unnecessary.[1]

Incidentally, I should
like to know the opinion of the comrades from Russia as to whether the
expression “immediate demands” is clear enough or whether we should
not add “the minimum programme” in parenthesis. In point (c) I use
the word “are”, while Comrade Zimin proposes “should
be”; evidently a stylistic correction is needed here. Where Party control
is dealt with, I think my old formulation “the safeguarding of the

    

independence of the Social-Democratic Party” is better than
“preserving”, which Comrade Zimin proposes. Our task is not only to
“preserve” the independence of the Social-Democratic Party, but
constantly to “safeguard” it. Comrade Sosnovsky’s amendment to this
point only mars the formulation by making it vaguer. Comrade Andreyev’s
proposals for changes are covered in part in the points of my resolution and of
Comrade Zimin’s. Incidentally, it is hardly appropriate to put
“provisional government” in the plural in the formulation, as
Comrade Andreyev proposes. Of course, we may have many provisional governments;
but we should not make a point of it, for we do not in any sense strive for
such partitioning. We shall always stand for a single provisional government of
all-Russia and strive to create “a single centre, and a Russian one at
that”. (Laughter.)

Report on the Resolution on the Support of the Peasant
Movement
April 19 (May 2)

In view of the statement of seventeen comrades calling attention to the urgent
need for speeding up the work of the Congress, I shall try to be as brief as
possible. Strictly speaking, there are no moot points of principle in the
question under discussion; none arose even during the Party crisis, which was
rich in differences on points of “principle”.


Moreover, the draft resolution was published in Vperyod quite some time
ago; I shall therefore confine myself merely to supporting the resolution.


The question of supporting the peasant movement divides itself into two aspects:

(1) fundamentals, and

(2) the practical experience of the Party. The
latter will be dealt with by our second reporter, Comrade
Barsov,[3]

who is thoroughly familiar with our most advanced peasant movement—
that in Guria. As regards the fundamentals involved, it is now a matter of
reaffirming the slogans elaborated by Social-Democracy and adapting them to the
peasant movement of today. This movement is growing and spreading before our
eyes. The government is up to its old game of trying to fool the peasantry with
sham concessions. This policy of corruption must be countered with the. slogans
of our Party.


These slogans, in my opinion, are set forth in the following Draft Resolution:


“The Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, as the party of the
class-conscious proletariat, strives to bring about the complete emancipation of
all working people

    

from every kind of exploitation, and supports every revolutionary movement
against the present social and political system. Therefore, the
R.S.D.L.P. strongly supports the present-day peasant movement, among others, and
stands for all revolutionary measures capable of improving the condition of the
peasantry, not halting at the expropriation of the landed estates to this
end. At the same time, as the class party of the proletariat, the
R.S.D.L.P. works undeviatingly towards an independent class organisation of the
rural proletarians, ever mindful of its obligation to make clear to them the
antagonism of their interests to those of the peasant bourgeoisie, to bring
them to understand that only the common struggle of the rural and the urban
proletariat against the whole of bourgeois society can lead to the socialist
revolution, which alone is capable of really freeing the mass of the rural poor
from poverty and exploitation.


“As a practical slogan for agitation among the peasantry, and as a means of
instilling the utmost political consciousness into this movement, the
R.S.D.L.P. proposes the immediate formation of revolutionary peasant committees
for all-round support of all democratic reforms and for their implementation in
detail. In these committees as well the R.S.D.L.P. will strive for an
independent organisation of the rural proletarians for the purpose of supporting
the entire peasantry in all its revolutionary-democratic actions, on the one
band, and, on the other, of safeguarding the true interests of the rural
proletariat in its struggle against the peasant bourgeoisie”
(Vperyod,

No. 11[1]

).



This Draft was discussed by the Agrarian Committee, which the delegates had
appointed in advance of the Congress for its preparation. Although opinion was
considerably divided, certain major trends were clearly in evidence, and it is
with these that I intend to deal. The nature of the possible and necessary
revolutionary measures in the sphere of the agrarian question is according to
the Draft Resolution “the improvement in the condition of the
peasantry”. Thus, the Resolution clearly expresses thereby the general
conviction of all Social-Democrats that no fundamental change in the present
social and economic system can be achieved by

    

these measures. In this we differ from the Socialists-Revolutionaries. The
      revolutionary movement of the peasants may lead to a considerable
      improvement in their condition, but not to the supplanting of capitalism
      by another mode of production.


The Resolution speaks of measures that will not halt at the expropriation of the
landed estates. It has been said that this formulation modifies our agrarian
programme. I consider this opinion wrong. The wording could be improved, of
course, to read that it is the peasantry and not our Party that will not halt at
expropriation; our Party supports the peasantry and will support it also when it
does not halt at such measures. The narrower concept “confiscation”
should be used instead of expropriation, since we are emphatically opposed to
compensation in any shape or form. We will never hesitate to employ such
measures as confiscation of the land. But apart from these partial emendations,
we see nothing in our Resolution that modifies our agrarian programme. All
Social-Democratic publicists have constantly expressed the view that the point
concerning the cut-off lands does not by any means set limits to the peasant
movement, either to curtail or to restrict it. Both Plekhanov and I have stated
in the press that the Social-Democratic Party will never hold the peasantry back
from revolutionary measures of agrarian reform, including the
“general redistribution”[4]

of the land. Thus, we are not modifying our
agrarian programme. We must now take a definite stand on the practical question
of consistent support to the peasants, to avoid any possible misunderstandings
or misinterpretations. The peasant movement is now on the order of the day, and
the party of the proletariat should declare officially that it gives this
movement full support and does not in any way limit its scope.


The Resolution goes on to speak of the need to bring the interests of the rural
proletariat into focus and to organise this proletariat separately. There is
hardly any need to defend this simple axiom before a gathering of Social-Democrats. It was stated in the Agrarian Committee that it would be a good thing to
add a point on the support of strikes of the farm labourers and peasants,
especially during the harvesting, haymaking, etc. In principle, of course,
there can

    

be nothing against this. Let our practical workers say what they think of the
possible significance of such a point for the immediate future.


The Resolution further speaks of the formation of revolutionary peasant
committees.


The idea that the demand for the immediate formation of revolutionary peasant
committees should be made the pivot of our agitation was developed in
Vperyod,

       No. 15.[2]

Even the reactionaries now talk of “improving
the living conditions”, but they stand for an official, bureaucratic way
of pseudo-improvement, whereas the Social-Democrats, of course, must stand for
the revolutionary way of effecting the improvement. The main task is to instil
political consciousness into the peasant movement. The peasants know what they
want in a vague sort of way, but they are unable to see their wishes and demands
in relation to the entire political system. That is why they are such easy game
for political tricksters, who reduce the question of political changes to
economic “improvements”, which cannot really be effected without
political changes. Therefore, the slogan calling for revolutionary peasant
committees is the only correct one. Unless these committees are able to enforce
the revolutionary law, the peasants will never be able to hold what they may now
win. It is objected that here, too, we are modifying the agrarian programme,
which says nothing about revolutionary peasant committees or their
functions in the field of democratic reforms. This objection does not hold
water. We are not modifying our programme but applying it to a concrete
case. Since no doubt exists that the peasant committees cannot be anything but
revolutionary under the given conditions, by noting this fact we are
merely applying the programme to the revolutionary moment, not
changing it. Our
programme, for instance, declares that we recognise the right of nations to
self-determination; if concrete conditions brought us to express ourselves in
favour of self-determination of a definite nation, of its complete independence, that would be, not a change of the programme, but its application. The
peasant committees are an elastic institution, suitable both under present
conditions and

    

under, let us say, a provisional revolutionary government, when they would
      become organs of the government. Some hold that these committees may
      become reactionary instead of revolutionary. But we Social-Democrats have
      never forgotten the dual nature of the peasant or the possibility of a
      reactionary peasant movement against the proletariat. Not this is the
      point at issue, but rather that at the present time peasant committees
      formed to sanction land reforms cannot be anything but revolutionary. At
      the present time the peasant movement is unquestionably
      revolutionary. Some say that the peasants will quieten down after they
      have seized the land. Possibly. But the autocratic government will not
      quieten down if the peasants seize the land, and this is the crux of the
      matter. Only a revolutionary government or revolutionary peasant
      committees can sanction this seizure.


Lastly, the concluding part of the Resolution defines once more the position of
the Social-Democrats in the peasant committees, namely, the necessity of
marching together with the rural proletariat and organising it separately and
independently. In the countryside, too, there can be only one consistently
revolutionary class—the proletariat.

Draft Resolution on the Support of the Peasant Movement

1. Whereas the growing peasant movement, though spontaneous and politically
  unconscious, is nonetheless inevitably directed against the existing
  political order and against the privileged classes;


2. Whereas it is one of the tasks of Social-Democracy to support every
   revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order;


3. Whereas, in view of the aforesaid, the Social-Democrats must strive to bring
   out the revolutionary-democratic features (characteristics) of the peasant
   movement, to uphold them and develop them to their logical conclusion; and


4. Whereas the Social-Democratic Party, as the party of the proletariat, must in
   all cases and under all circumstances work steadfastly for the independent
   organisation of the rural proletariat and to clarify for this class the
   irreconcilable antagonism between its interests and those of the peas ant
   bourgeoisie;—


Therefore, the Third Party Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
instructs all Party organisations:


a) to carry on propaganda among the proletariat at large, explaining that the
R.S.D.L.P. makes it its aim to support with the utmost vigour the present-day
peasant movement, without opposing its revolutionary manifestations,
including the confiscation of the landed estates;


b) as a practical slogan for agitation among the peasantry and as a means of
instilling the utmost political consciousness into the peasant movement, a plan
should be launched

    

for the immediate organisation of revolutionary peasant committees that shall
      have as their aim the carrying out of all revolutionary-democratic reforms
      in the interests of the peasantry and the liberation of the peasantry from
      the tyranny of the police, the officials, and the landlords;


 c) to recommend to the peasantry non-performance of military
service, flat refusal to pay taxes, and refusal to recognise the
authorities, in order to disorganise the autocratic regime and support
the revolutionary onset directed against it;


  d) to work within the peasant committees for the independent
  organisation of the rural proletariat and for its closest
possible association with the urban proletariat in a single
Social-Democratic party of the working class.

Speech on the Question of the Relations Between Workers and
Intellectuals within the Social-Democratic Organisations
April 20 (May 3)

I cannot agree with the comrades who said it was inappropriate to
broaden the scope of this question. It is quite appropriate.


It has been said here that the exponents of Social-Democratic ideas have been
mainly intellectuals. That is not so. During the period of Economism the
exponents of revolutionary ideas were workers, not intellectuals. This is
confirmed by “A Worker”, the author of the pamphlet published with a
foreword by Comrade Axelrod.


Comrade Sergeyev asserted here that the elective principle will not make for
better information. That is not so. if the elective principle were applied
in practice, we should unquestionably be much better informed than we
now are.


It has also been pointed out that splits have usually been the work of
intellectuals. This is an important point, but it does not settle the
question. In my writings for the press I have long urged that as many workers as
possible should be placed on the

     committees.[1]

The period since the Second
Congress has been marked by inadequate attention to this duty—such is the
impression I have received from talks with comrades engaged in practical Party
work. If in Saratov only one worker was placed on the committee, this means
that they did not. know how to choose suitable people

    

from among the workers. No doubt, this was due also to the split within the
      Party; the struggle for the committees has had a damaging effect on
      practical work. For this very reason we endeavoured in every way possible
      to speed the convening of the Congress.


It will be the task of the future centre to reorganise a considerable number of
our committees; the inertness of the committee-men has to be
overcome. (Applause and booing.)


I can hear Comrade Sergeyev booing while the non-committee-men applaud. I think
we should look at the matter more broadly. To place workers on the committees is
a political, not only a pedagogical, task. Workers have the class instinct,
and, given some political experience, they pretty soon become staunch
Social-Democrats. I should be strongly in favour of having eight workers to
every two intellectuals on our committees. Should the advice given in our Party
literature—to place as many workers as possible on the committees—be insufficient, it would be advisable for this recommendation to
be given in the name of the Congress. A clear and definite directive from the
Congress will give you a radical means of fighting demagogy; this is the express
will of the Congress.

Draft Resolution on the Relations Between Workers and
Intellectuals within the Social-Democratic Organisations

1. Whereas the Right Wing of our Party still continues the
systematic attempts, begun in the days of Economism, to spread hostility and
distrust among the Party members— the workers and the
intellectuals—attempts to represent our Party organisations as consisting
solely of intellectuals (an allegation of which the enemies of Social-Democracy
make clever use); attempts to accuse the Social-Democratic organisations of
striving to fetter the initiative of the working class through the
instrumentality of Party discipline; attempts to flaunt the elective-principle
slogan for the most part without any design to apply it in practice; and


2. Whereas the full assertion of the elective principle, possible and
   necessary under conditions of political freedom, is unfeasible under the
   autocracy, though even under the autocracy this principle could be applied to
   a much larger extent than it is today, were it not for the obstacle presented
   by the Party organisation’s diffuse form and actual disorganisation, for
   which the Party is indebted to the selfsame Right Wing of
   Social-Democracy;— Therefore, the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
   recognising its duty to prepare for the coming congresses, by a series of
   organisational reforms, the pre-conditions for a real application of the
   elective principle in Party life, to the extent possible, calls attention
   once more to the task confronting the class-conscious adherents of the
   Social-Democratic workers’ party: that they make every effort to

    

strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses of the working class by
      raising still wider sections of proletarians and semi-proletarians to full
      Social-Democratic consciousness, by developing their revolutionary
      Social-Democratic activity, by seeing to it that the greatest possible
      number of workers capable of leading the movement and the Party
      organisations be advanced from among the mass of the working class to
      membership on the local centres and on the all-Party centre through the
      creation of a maximum number of working-class organisations adhering to
      our Party, by seeing to it that working-class organisations unwilling or
      unable to enter the Party should at least be associated with it.

Organisations
April 22 (May 5)

I could hardly keep my seat when it was said here that there are no workers fit
to sit on the committees. The question is being dragged out; obviously there is
something the matter with the Party. Workers must be given places on the
committees. Oddly enough, there are only three publicists at the Congress, the
others being committee-men; it appears however that the publicists are for
placing the workers, whereas the committee-men for some reason are quite
wrought up over it.


The statements by Comrades Golubin[1]

and Mikhailov are highly
valuable.

I am not of accord with Comrade Sergeyev in this; it is precisely such congress
resolutions that do not exist. The wishes of the publicists are not
enough. Besides, the resolutions were not rejected, but merely shifted to
another item of the agenda. Some point to the fact that the workers have the
right, with the consent of the Central Committee, to cashier the
committees. That is not enough; we want a directive, not demagogy. Comrade
Sergeyev misinterprets Vperyod when he talks about “fine words
buttering no

pars nips”. 

It is the brevity of the Rules clause that makes
us adopt a resolution containing a certain directive. I am against Comrade
Andreyev’s proposal. It is not true that it was neither the
“Economists” nor the “Mensheviks” who started the
demagogy. On the contrary, it was they who were the demagogues. Precisely this
is what the resolution is—a warning against demagogy. For this reason I
insist upon the resolution.

22
Speech During the Discussion of the Party Rules
April 21 (May 4)

I must confess that the arguments employed by Comrade Ivanov in defence of his
idea of a single centre seem to me untenable. (The speaker reads the
argumentation of Comrade
Ivanov):



“On Clauses 4 and 5. The system of two centres with a balancer, the
Council, has been condemned by past experience. The history of the Party crisis
plainly shows that this system provides too favourable a soil for the growth of
differences, squabbles, and Court intrigues. It means the subordination of the
people in Russia to those abroad: owing to arrests, the Central Committee
personnel is unstable, whereas the Editorial Board of the Central Organ is
constant; and the Council resides abroad. On the one hand, all the most
important objections against a single centre, based on the actual severance of
Russia from the people abroad, only confirm the idea that a split between the
two centres is possible and even probable. On the other hand, these objections
largely fall away if the Congress makes periodic conferences obligatory between
the Russian members of the C.C. and the members abroad.”



It has been found, however, that the fine qualities here alluded to are
possessed in equal measure both by the Central Organ abroad and by the
“genuinely Russian” Central Committee. In Comrade Ivanov’s entire
reasoning I discern the fallacy envisaged by logic as post hoc, ergo propter

      hoc.[1]

Because the three centres have, pardon the
expression, played us dirty, let us have a single centre. I fail to see the
propter here. Our troubles were not due to the mechanism but to
persons; what happened was that certain persons, using a formal interpretation
of the Rules as a subterfuge,

    

ignored the will of the Congress. Has not the “genuinely Russian”
      C.C. “dialectically” turned into its exact opposite? Comrade
      Ivanov’s reasoning is—the group abroad has acted shabbily; we must
      therefore put it under a “state of siege” and keep a
      “tight hold” on it. As you know, I have always been an
      advocate of a “state of siege” and of a “tight
      hold”, so that I shall raise no objection to such measures. But does
      not the C.C. deserve the same treatment? Besides, who will deny that the
      Central Organ can be constant, while the C.C. cannot? This, after all, is
      a fact. But in practice I shall abstain from all polemic. Formerly we had
      the Council, and now we shall have a conference (of the C.C. section
      working abroad and of the section working in Russia). A difference of
      only a couple of letters. Our cart has been lurching all the time to the
      right, towards the Central Organ—Comrade Ivanov has been laying the
      straw on the right side, to cushion the fall. But I think it ought to be
      laid on the left side as well, on the side of the C.C. I would subscribe
      to Comrade Mikhailov’s proposal to cashier the committees, but I really
      don’t know what the periphery exactly is. “Chair-warmers and keepers
      of the seal” should all be smoked out; but how is one to define
      precisely the concept “periphery”? “Two-thirds of the votes
      of the periphery!"—but who can keep a strict record of the
      periphery? I must, besides, warn the Congress against cramming the Rules
      with too many clauses. It is easy enough to pen nice clauses, but in
      practice they usually prove superfluous. The Rules should not be made a
      collection of pious wishes....

Speech on the Wording of Clause 9 of the Party Rules
April 21 (May 4)

I was for cashiering the committees, but in the Patty Council,
at the time when our factional strife was raging, I spoke against it, since
there would have been a certain impropriety in the exercise of that right. If
this clause constitutes a threat to the committees consisting of intellectuals,
then I am all for it. A tight hold must always be kept on the intelligentsia. It
is always the instigator of all sorts of squabbles, and therefore I move that we
substitute the words “organised workers” for the word
“periphery” (the speaker submits his amendment in
writing):

“Clause 9. A local committee must be dissolved by the C.C. if two-thirds of
the local workers belonging to the Party organisations declare for such
dissolution.”


One cannot rely on a small periphery of intellectuals, but one can and should
rely on hundreds of organised workers. I would like to connect this clause
closely with the question of submitting reports. In this respect we should take
an example from the Bund, which always knows the exact number of organised
workers it has. And when our C.C. is constantly posted on the number of
organised workers in any particular organisation, it will have to reckon with
their opinion and will be bound to cashier the local committee on the demand of
the organised workers.

Speech on an Agreement with the Socialists-Revolutionaries
April 23 (May 6)

I have to inform the Congress of an unsuccessful attempt to come to an agreement
with the Socialists-Revolutionaries. Comrade Gapon arrived abroad. He met with
the Socialists-Revolutionaries, then with the Iskra people, and
finally with me. He told me that he shared the point of view of the
Social-Democrats, but for various reasons did not deem it possible to say so
openly. I told him that diplomacy was a good thing, but not between
revolutionaries. I shall not repeat our conversation; it was reported in

  Vperyod.[1]

He impressed me as being an enterprising and clever man,
unquestionably devoted to the revolution, though unfortunately without
a consistent revolutionary outlook.


Some time later I received a written invitation from Comrade Gapon to attend a
conference of socialist organisations, convened, according to his idea, for the
purpose of co-ordinating their activities. Here is a list of the eighteen
organisations which, according to that letter, were invited to Comrade Gapon’s
conference:


(1) The Socialist-Revolutionary Party, (2) the Vperyod R.S.D.L.P., (3)
    the Iskra R.S.D.L.P., (4) the Polish Socialist Party, (5) the
    Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania, (6) the P.S.P.,
    Proletariat, (7) the Lettish Social-Democratic Labour Party, (8)
    the Bund, (9) the Armenian Social-Democratic Labour Organisation, (10) the
    Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Droshak), (II) The Byelorussian
    Socialist

    

Hromada, (12) the Lettish Social-Democratic League, (13) the
Active Resistance Party of Finland, (14) the Workers’ Party
of Finland, (15) the Georgian Party of Socialist-Federalist
Revolutionaries, (16) the Ukrainian Revolutionary Party,
(17) the Lithuanian Social-Democratic Party, and (18) the
Ukrainian Socialist Party.


I pointed out both to Comrade Gapon and to a prominent Socialist-Revolutionary
that the dubious make-up of the conference might create difficulties. The
Socialists-Revolutionaries were building up an overwhelming conference
majority. The convocation of the conference was greatly delayed. Iskra
replied, as documents submitted to me by Comrade Gapon show, that it preferred
direct agreements with organised parties. A “gentle” hint at
Vperyod’s being an alleged disrupter, etc. In the end Iskra
did not attend the conference. We, the representatives of both the
Vperyod Editorial Board and the Bureau of Committees of the Majority,
did attend. Arriving on the scene, we saw that the conference was a
Socialist-Revolutionary affair. As it became clear, either the working-class
parties had not been invited at all, or there was no record of their having been
invited. Thus, the Active Resistance Party of Finland was represented, but not
the Workers’ Party of Finland.


When we asked for the reason, we were told that the invitation to the Workers’
Party of Finland had been sent via the Active Resistance Party, since, in the
words of the Socialist-Revolutionary who offered the explanation, they did not
know how to send it directly. Yet anyone who is at all familiar with things
abroad knows that connections with the Workers’ Party of Finland can be
established, if only through Branting, the leader of the Swedish
Social-Democratic Labour Party. There were representatives from the
Polish Socialist Party
in attendance, but no representative from the Social-Democracy of Poland and
Lithuania. Nor was it possible to ascertain whether an invitation had been
extended. No reply had been received from the Lithuanian Social-Democracy or
from the Ukrainian Revolutionary Party, we were told by the same
Socialist-Revolutionary.


From the outset the national question was made an issue. The Polish Socialist
Party raised the question of having several constituent assemblies. This gives
me reason to say

    

that in the future it will be necessary for us either to refuse outright to take
      any part in such conferences, or to convene a conference of
      representatives of the working-class parties of one nationality, or to
      invite to the conference representatives of local party committees from
      the regions with a non-Russian population. But I certainly do not infer
      from this that conferences are impossible because of differences on points
      of principle. All that is necessary is that only practical questions be
      taken up.


We cannot control the composition of conferences, etc., from abroad. The Russian
centre must be represented, and representatives of the local committees must
take part with out fail. The question that led to our withdrawal concerned the
Letts. On leaving the conference we submitted the following declaration:



“The important historical period through which Russia is passing confronts
the Social-Democratic and revolutionary-democratic parties and organisations
working within the country with the task of reaching a practical agreement for a
more effective attack on the autocratic regime.


“While, therefore, attaching very great importance to the conference called
for that purpose, we must naturally subject the composition of the conference to
the closest scrutiny.


“In the conference called by Comrade Gapon this condition, so essential to
its success, has unfortunately not been properly observed, and we were therefore
obliged, at its very initiation, to take measures calculated to ensure the
genuine success of the gathering.


“The fact that the conference was to deal solely with practical matters
made it necessary, in the first place, that only organisations truly
constituting a real force in Russia should be afforded participation.


“Actually, the composition of the conference, as far as the reality of some
of the organisations is concerned, is most unsatisfactory. Even an organisation
of whose fictitious nature there is not the slightest doubt, found
representation. We refer to the Lettish Social-Democratic League.


“The representative of the Lettish Social-Democratic Labour Party objected
to the seating of this League and couched his objection in the form of an
ultimatum.


“The utter fictitiousness of the ’League’, as subsequently established at a
special meeting of the representatives of the four Social-Democratic
organisations and the delegates of the ’League’, naturally compelled us, the
remaining Social-Democratic organisations and parties attending the conference,
to endorse the ultimatum.


“At the outset, however, we came up against the strong resistance of all
the revolutionary-democratic parties, which, in refusing to meet our peremptory
demand, showed that they preferred one fictitious group to a number of
well-known Social-Democratic organisations.

 

“Finally, the practical significance of the conference was still further
lowered by the absence of a number of other Social-Democratic organisations,
whose participation, as far as we could ascertain, no proper measures had been
taken to ensure.


“Though compelled, in view of all this, to leave the conference, we express
our conviction that the failure of this one attempt will not stand in the way of
earnest efforts to renew the endeavour in the very near future, and that the
task that confronts all revolutionary parties of reaching a practical agreement
will be accomplished by the coming conference, to be composed of organisations
actually working in Russia, and not of fictitious organisations.


 “For the Lettish S.D.L.P . . . . . . F. Rozin.


 “For the Vperyod R.S.D.L.P . . . . . N. Lenin.


 “For the Central Committee of the Bund . . . I. Gelfin.


“For the Armenian Social-Democratic Labour Organisation . . . Lerr.”



A week and a half or two weeks later Comrade Gapon sent me the following
statement:



“Dear Comrade


“I am forwarding to you two declarations issued by the conference of which
you know, and I request that you communicate their contents to the forthcoming
Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. I deem it my duty to state that for my own part
I accept these declarations with certain reservations on the questions of the
socialist programme and the principle of federalism.


“Georgi Gapon.”



This statement was accompanied by two interesting documents, containing the
following striking passages:



“The application of the federative principle to the relations between
nationalities remaining under one state roof....


“Socialisation, i.e., the transfer under public administration to the use
by the labouring agricultural population of all lands whose cultivation is based
on the exploitation of the labour of others; the determination of the concrete
forms this measure is to take, of the order in which it is to be instituted, and
of its scope, is to remain within the jurisdiction of the parties of the
different nationalities, in keeping with the specific local conditions of each
country; the development of public, municipal, and communal economy....


“... Bread for the starving!


“The land and its bounties for all the toilers!


A Constituent Assembly of representatives of all parts of the Russian Empire,
exclusive of Poland and Finland!


Convocation of a Constituent Assembly for the Caucasus, as an autonomous part of
Russia with which it is to be federated...


 

The result of the conference, as appears from these quotations, has fully
      confirmed the fears which induced us to leave the conference. We have here
      a copy of the Socialist-Revolutionary programme with all sorts of
      concessions to the nationalist non-proletarian parties. It was strange
      taking part in deciding the questions raised at the conference without
      the participation of the national proletarian parties. For instance, the
      conference presented the demand for a separate Constituent Assembly for
      Poland. We can be neither for nor against the demand. Our
      programme recognises the principle of the self-determination of
      nationalities. But to
      decide this question without the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania
      is impermissible. The conference divided up the Constituent Assembly, and
      this in the absence of the working-class parties! We cannot allow any
      practical solution of such questions to be reached without the party of
      the proletariat.


At the same time, I find that differences on points of principle do not exclude
the possibility of practical conferences, provided, first, that they be held in
Russia; secondly, that the reality of the forces be verified; and, thirdly,
that questions concerning the various nationalities be dealt with separately,
or at least, that representatives of the local committees of the regions where
there are Social-Democratic and non-Social-Democratic national parties be
invited to the conference.


I now pass to the proposed resolution on practical agreements with the
Socialists-Revolutionaries. (The speaker reads the draft as worded by
Comrade Voinov):



 “Confirming the attitude of the R.S.D.L.P. towards the
 Socialist-Revolutionary Party as set forth in the resolution of the
 Second Congress, and


 1. Whereas temporary militant agreements between the
 Social-Democratic Party and the organisation of the
 Socialists-Revolutionaries for the purposes of combating the
 autocracy are on the whole
 desirable at the present time; and


2. Whereas such agreements should under no circumstance restrict the
complete independence of the Social-Democratic Labour Party, or affect
the integrity and purity of its proletarian tactics and
principles;—


Therefore, the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. instructs the C.C.
and the local committees, should the necessity arise, to enter into
temporary militant agreements with the Socialist-Revolutionary
organisations,

    

provided that local agreements are concluded only under the direct
supervision of the C.C.”



 I agree with this draft. We might perhaps tone down the end. For
 instance, instead of “under the direct supervision of the
 Central Committee”, we might have only “under the
 supervision of the Central Committee”.

Speech on the Report on the Work of the Central Committee
April 25 (May 8)

Actually, the report on the work of the Central Committee dealt more with its
technical than its political activities. I have been following the work of the
central apparatus of the Party since 1900 and I must say that gigantic progress
has been made. If it does not quite satisfy us, well, complete satisfaction can
be expected only under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and even then,
hardly! Let us not forget that co-optation” is still working harm! The
C.C. had little to say about its policies, for it cannot say anything good about
them. Its major mistake was its opposition to the calling of the Congress. Had
the Congress been called a year earlier, it would have proved more
conciliatory. I am myself in favour of cashiering; but I am definitely against
it in one case—if it is done because of agitation for the
Congress. However, I shall not dwell on this. There is more joy over one sinner
that repenteth than over ninety and nine just

per sons. 

As to the reproaches
levelled at me, let me say only that a publicist is not in a position to do
anything without the Party.

1. Whereas the specific social and political conditions in the

The Russian revolution has only just begun, but already all the features
peculiar to political revolutions of the bourgeoisie stand clearly revealed. The
lower classes fight, the upper reap the benefit of it. All the incredible hard
ships of the revolutionary struggle have fallen upon the proletariat, as a
class, and on a few young intellectuals from among the bourgeoisie. Nine-tenths
of all the liberties that have been partially won (rather, scant strips of
liberty) go to the upper classes of society, to those who do not work. Despite
the law, there is now incomparably greater freedom of speech, assembly, and the
press in Russia than there was ten years, one year, ago; but only the bourgeois
newspapers and the “liberal” meetings benefit thereby to any extent
worth mentioning. In their powerful urge towards freedom the workers keep
forcing their way into new realms hitherto thought inaccessible to them; but
this infiltration of the proletarian element proves, rather than refutes, our
point. Active participation in the political struggle is in inverse ratio to the
active appropriation of its fruits. The more advantageous the status of a given
class in the socio-economic structure is, the more “advantageous”
is the relation between the legal and the illegal movement (i.e., between what
is permitted by law and what is contrary to the law). The movement of the
liberal bourgeoisie, especially since January 9, has spread so widely in forms
tolerated by the law that the illegal liberal movement has begun to
dwindle be fore our very eyes with amazing rapidity. The movement of the working
class, despite its assumptions, in one of its crucial phases, of an
ultra-“legal” form (the presentation of a petition to the tsar by the
working people of St. Petersburg),

    

finds itself completely outlawed and subject to harsh military reprisals. The
      movement of the working class has grown in comparably wider, but the
      relation between the legal and the illegal elements has hardly changed in
      favour of the former.


Whence this difference? Because the whole social and economic structure of
Russia yields most fruit to those who work the least. Under capitalism that
cannot be otherwise. It is the law of capital, which rules the political as well
as the economic life. The movement of the lower classes raises a revolutionary
force; it raises a mass of people, who, for one thing, are capable of tearing
down the whole rotten structure, and, for another, are not attached to that
structure by any special features of their position and would gladly tear it
down. What is more, even though they are not fully conscious of their
aims. these masses are nonetheless able and prone to tear the structure down,
because their position is desperate, since constant oppression drives them to
take the revolutionary way, and they have nothing to lose but their chains. This
popular force, the proletariat, looms formidable before the lords of the rotten
structure because there is some thing in the very position of the proletariat
that is a menace to all exploiters. For that reason, any movement of the
proletariat, however small, however modest it may be at the start, however
slight its occasion, inevitably threatens to outgrow its immediate aims and to
develop into a force irreconcilable to the entire old order and
destructive of it.


The movement of the proletariat, by reason of the essential peculiarities of
the position of this class under capitalism, has a marked tendency to develop
into a desperate all-out struggle, a struggle for complete victory over
all the dark forces of exploitation and oppression. The movement of the liberal
bourgeoisie, on the contrary, and for the same reasons (i.e., by virtue of the
essential peculiarities of the bourgeoisie’s position), has a tendency towards
compromise instead of struggle, towards opportunism instead of radicalism,
towards modest calculation of the likeliest and most possible immediate gains
instead of a “tactless”, bold, and determined bid for complete
victory. He who puts up a real fight will naturally go all out; he who
prefers compromise to struggle will naturally point out beforehand what
“morsels” he would be inclined, at best, to content himself

    

with (at worst, he would be content even with no struggle at all, i.e., he would
make a lasting peace with the masters of the old world).


It is therefore quite natural for Social-Democracy, as the party of the
revolutionary proletariat, to be so concerned for its programme, to
take such pains to establish well in advance its ultimate aim, the complete
emancipation of the working people, and jealously to guard this aim against any
attempts to whittle it down. For the same reasons Social-Democracy is so
dogmatically strict and firmly doctrinaire in keeping its ultimate goal clear of
all minor, immediate economic and political aims. He who goes all out,
who fights for complete victory, must alert himself to the danger of having his
hands tied by minor gains, of being led astray and made to forget that which is
still comparatively remote, but without which all minor gains are hollow
vanities. Such concern for the programme and the ever critical attitude towards
small and gradual improvements are incomprehensible and foreign to a party of
the bourgeoisie, however great its love for freedom and the people may be.


We were launched upon these reflections by the “Draft of a Russian
Constitution”, recently published by Osvobozhdeniye under the
title “The Fundamental State Law of the Russian Empire”. This draft,
known in Russia for some time, has now been issued with annotations and an
explanatory comment as “the only complete, definitive edition revised by
the authors themselves”. It appears that this draft originates, not with
the Osvobozhdeniye League, but rather with a private group belonging to
the League. Thus, we see here once again the dread of a clear, definite, and
straightforward programme, which is typical of liberalism. The liberal party
in Russia possesses immeasurably greater funds and publication capacities, and
immeasurably greater freedom of movement on legal ground than does
Social-Democracy; yet, with regard to programmatic definiteness, it
falls strikingly behind Social-Democracy. The liberals fight shy of
programmes; they prefer
various contradictory statements in their newspaper (e.g., on the question of
universal suffrage), or the “drafts” of private groups, which do
not in any way commit the party as a whole (or the whole
Osvobozhdeniye League). This is no accident, of course. It is
the inevitable

    

 result of the bourgeoisie’s social position, as a class, in modern
      society—a class caught between the autocracy and the proletariat and
      rent into factions over petty differences in interests. Political
      sophisms follow naturally from such a situation.


We should like to draw the reader’s attention to one such sophism. The main
features of Osvobozhdeniye’s draft constitution are well known: the
monarchy is retained—the question of the republic is not even
discussed (apparently the
“Realpolitiker” of the bourgeoisie do not consider this
question important enough!); a bicameral parliamentary system is to be
set up with universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot for
the Lower House, and with two-stage elections for the Upper. The
members of the

Up per House 

are to be elected by the Zemstvo Assemblies and the
municipal councils. There is no need to dwell on the details of this draft. The
interest lies in its general conception and its advocacy on grounds of
principle.


Our generous-spirited liberals want to share the state power as evenly and
“fairly” as possible among three forces:

the monarch, the Upper House (the Zemstvo House), and the Lower House (the House
of People’s Representatives), that is, the autocratic bureaucracy, the
bourgeoisie, and the “people” (the proletariat, the peasantry, and
the petty bourgeoisie at large). The liberal publicists, in their heart of
hearts, want the strife between these contending forces and the various
combinations of these forces to be superseded by a “fair” concord of
unity ... on paper! The thing is to have a gradual, balanced development, to
justify universal suffrage from the point of view of the conservatives
(Mr. Struve’s preface to this draft); a real guarantee for the interests of the
ruling classes (i.e., real conservatism) is to be created in the form of the
monarchy and the Upper House; and this supposedly

cunning,but 

actually very
naive, construction is to be clothed in highflown sophisms. The Russian
proletariat will have to deal with liberal sophisms for a long time to come. It
is time we examined them more closely.


The liberals begin their defence of the bicameral system by analysing
anticipated objections to it. Characteristically, these objections are borrowed
entirely from the usual

    

font of liberal-Narodnik ideas, which are being widely promulgated by our legal
press. The nature of Russian society, it is claimed, is “profoundly
democratic” and there is nothing in Russia like an upper class that owes
its strength to its political services, to wealth, etc., for our nobility has
been a class of servants of the government without “political
ambitions”, besides which its material power has been
“sapped”. From the point of view of a Social-Democrat it is absurd
to take this Narodnik phrase-mongering seriously; there is not a word of truth
in it. The political privileges enjoyed by the nobility in Russia are only too
well known; the nobility’s strength is plainly evident in the tendencies of the
conservative and moderate, or Shipov, party; its material power is
“sapped” only by the bourgeoisie, with which the nobility is
merging, and which does not in the least prevent it from amassing immense
wealth that enables it to rob tens of millions of toilers. The class-conscious
workers should have no illusions on this score. Narodnik phrase-mongering on the
insignificance of the Russian nobility merely serves the liberals as a means of
sugaring the pill of future constitutional privileges of the nobility. This
liberal logic is psychologically inevitable; our nobility must be depicted as
negligible in order that its privileges may seem only a negligible departure
from democracy.


With the bourgeoisie occupying a position between the hammer and the anvil,
idealistic phrases, too, are psychologically inevitable, phrases which our
liberals in general and their pet philosophers in particular are now mouthing
with such bad taste. “As far as the Russian liberation movement is
concerned,” we read in the explanatory comment, “democracy is not only a
fact but a moral and political postulate. It places moral justification for any
social form above its historical justification....” Not a bad example of the
turgid meaningless phraseology with which our liberals “justify”
their approach towards betrayal of democracy! They complain of the
“obloquy [?] that is heaped upon the Russian liberal party by
representatives of the more extreme elements, who allege that this party seeks
to put a bourgeois-aristocratic autocracy in the place of the bureaucratic
autocracy”— yet our liberals would have the only truly democratic
institution in their scheme, the House of People’s

    

Representatives, share power with both the monarchy and the Upper, Zemstvo,
      House!


Their “ethical” and “moral-political” arguments for an
Upper House are these. In the first place, “a bicameral system exists
everywhere in Europe, except in Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Luxemburg....” Not
everywhere, then, if there are exceptions? Besides, what sort of argument is
this: there are a great many anti-democratic bodies in Europe, therefore
... therefore they should be copied by our “profoundly democratic”
liberals? The second argument: “It is dangerous to concentrate the
legislative power in a single body”; another body should be set up to
rectify mistakes and “too hasty” decisions...; “should Russia
be bolder than Europe?” Thus, Russian liberalism does not want to be bolder than
European liberalism, which has knowingly lost its progressive character
through fear of the proletariat! Fine leaders of the “liberation”
movement, indeed! Not a single serious step towards freedom has been made in
Russia; yet the liberals already fear “hastiness”. Cannot the same
arguments be used, gentlemen, to justify the renunciation of universal suffrage
as well?


A third argument: “One of the principal dangers to any political system in
Russia is that it may be converted into a regime of Jacobin centralisation.” How
dreadful! The liberal opportunists evidently do not mind borrowing ammunition
against lower-class democracy from. the Social-Democratic opportunists, the
new-Iskrists. The ridiculous bogy of “Jacobinism” dragged out by
Axelrod, Martynov & Co. is doing the Osvobozhdeniye camp a good
turn. But, gentle men, if you really feared the excesses of centralism (and not
the “excesses” of consistent democracy), why should you
limit universal suffrage in elections of the local—Zemstvo and
municipal—bodies, as you are doing? Article 68 of your draft stipulates
that “every person having the right to vote in the elections to the House
of People’s Representatives has equally the right to vote in the local
elections, if he has been domiciled in the given uyezd or town for
a definite period of time, such restricted period not to exceed one
year.” This
article introduces a qualification, thereby virtually making the
franchise non-universal; for everyone understands that it is the
workers, farm-hands, and day-labourers

    

who are mostly obliged to move from town to town and from district to
district without a permanent place of residence. Capital drives masses of
workers from one end of the country to the other, giving them no chance to claim
permanent residence; and because of that the working class is to
forfeit a part of its political rights!


This limitation of universal suffrage is to apply to the very bodies, rural and
municipal, that elect the Upper, Zemstvo, House. To combat alleged excesses of
Jacobin centralism, a double departure is made from democracy: first,
universal suffrage is to be limited by the residence qualification;
secondly, the principle of direct suffrage is to be annulled by the
introduction of two-stage elections! Can anything be clearer than that the bogy
of Jacobinism only serves the purpose of every type of opportunists?


Small wonder, indeed, that Mr. Struve expressed his sympathy in principle with
the Social-Democratic Girondists—-the new-Iskrists, that he sang the
praises of Martynov, the famous champion of anti-“Jacobinism”. The Social-Democratic enemies of Jacobinism have paved the way for the liberal
bourgeois.


The contention of the Osvobozhdeniye crowd that the Upper House,
elected by the Zemstvo bodies, can best ex press “the principle of
decentralisation”, the “multiformity of the different parts of
Russia”, is sheer nonsense. Decentralisation cannot be expressed by
limitation of the universal basis of the elections; multiformity cannot be
expressed by limitation of the principle of direct elections. This is not the
crux of the matter, which the Osvobozhdeniye people are trying to
obscure. The real point is that by their system the Upper House is bound to
become pre-eminently and chiefly an organ of the nobility and the
bourgeoisie, since it is the proletariat that is largely affected by the
residence qualification and the two-stage system of elections. The point, is so
plain to anyone at all familiar with political questions that the authors of
the draft anticipate this inevitable objection.


“Some people will say,” we read in the explanatory comment, “that no
matter how the elections are organised, the big landowners and the employer
class stand a chance of keeping control in the local community. We think
[what a profoundly democratic thought!] that this is just another

    

case of exaggerated fear of the ’bourgeois element’. There is nothing

unfair j!] in 

      the landowning and manufacturing classes obtaining an adequate [1]
      chance of representing their interests [universal suffrage is not enough
      for the bourgeois

element! I, 

so long as other social groups are grant ed
      wide opportunities for representation. Only privileges are morally
      objectionable and politically dangerous....”


Let the workers make a careful note of this “liberal” morality. It
presumes to boast of democracy, to condemn “privileges”, while at
the same time justifying residence qualification, two-stage elections,
and the monarchy.... The monarchy, evidently, is not a “privilege”,
or perhaps it is a morally unobjectionable and politically non-dangerous
privilege!


Our society leaders of the “liberation” movement have started off
well! Even in their most ambitious projects. which do not in the least commit
their party as a whole, they devise advance apologies for reaction, defending
the privileges of the bourgeoisie with sophistic attempts to prove that
privileges are not privileges. Even in their publishing activities that least
depend on material calculations and are least affected by immediate political
aims, they contrive to prostitute the idea of democracy and slander the most
consistent of all bourgeois democrats—the Jacobins of the Great French
Revolution. And what are we to expect further? What are the practical
politicians of the liberal bourgeoisie, responsible to their party, going to
say, if the most idealistic of the liberals are already now preparing the
theoretical ground for betrayal? If the boldest ambitions of the extreme Left
Wing of the Osvobozhdeniye camp do not go beyond a monarchy with a
bicameral parliament, if that is the only price the ideologues of
liberalism demand, then on what terms will liberalism’s businessmen
strike a bargain?


The political sophisms of liberalism offer the revolutionary proletariat
slight, yet valuable, documentation as to the real class nature of even the most
advanced elements of
the bourgeoisie.

Comrades Workers! The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was recently held. This
Congress should mark a new phase in the history of our Social-Democratic
working-class movement. Russia is passing through a great historical
period. Revolution has broken out and its flames are spreading wider and wider,
embracing new regions and new sections of the population. The proletariat stands
at the head of the fighting forces of the revolution. It has already borne the
greatest sacrifices in the cause of freedom and is now preparing for the
decisive battle with the tsarist autocracy. The class-conscious representatives
of the proletariat know that freedom will not rid the working people of poverty,
oppression, and exploitation. The bourgeoisie, which now stands for the cause
of freedom, will, on the morrow of the revolution, try to deprive the workers
of as large a part of its conquests as possible and will show itself to be the
implacable enemy of the socialist demands of the proletariat. But we do not
fear a free, united, and strengthened bourgeoisie. We know that freedom will
enable us to wage a broad and open mass struggle for socialism. We know that
economic development will inexorably sap the power of capital and prepare the
victory of socialism, and that it will do this the more. rapidly, the more
freely it proceeds.


Comrades Workers! To achieve this great aim we must unite all class-conscious
proletarians in a single Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Our Party began
to constitute itself quite some time ago, immediately following the broad
working-class movement of 1895 and 1896. The year 1898 saw the convocation of
its First Congress,

which founded the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and outlined its
      aims. The Second Congress was held in 1903. It gave the Party a programme,
      adopted a series of resolutions on tactics, and endeavoured, for the first
      time, to build an integral Party organisation. True, the Party did not at
      once succeed in this effort. The minority at the Second Congress refused
      to submit to the majority and started a split that has caused great harm
      to the Social-Democratic working-class movement. The first step towards
      this split was the refusal to carry out the decisions of the Second
      Congress and to accept the leadership of the central bodies it had set
      up. The last step was the refusal to participate in the Third
      Congress. The Third Congress was convened by a Bureau elected by the
      majority of the committees working in Russia, and by the Central Committee
      of the Party. All the committees, breakaway groups, and the periphery
    organisations dissatisfied with the committees
    were invited to the Congress. The vast majority of these organisations,
    including nearly all the committees and organisations of the Minority,
    elected delegates and sent them abroad to attend the Congress. Thus
    everything possible under our police regime was done to convene an all-Party
    congress; it was only the refusal of three members of the former Party
    Council resident abroad that resulted in the boycott of the Congress by the
    entire Party Minority. The Third Congress, as will be seen from
      its resolution[1]

printed below, lays the entire responsibility for the
    split in the Party on these three members. Nevertheless, despite the absence
    of the Minority, the Third Congress took every measure to enable the
    Minority to work with the Majority in one party. The Congress held the
    reversion to the antiquated and superseded views of Economism discernible
    in our Party to be incorrect; at the same time, it provided
    precise and definite guarantees of the rights of every minority,
    guarantees embodied in the
    Rules of the Party and binding on all its members. The Minority now has the
    unconditional right, guaranteed by the Party Rules, to advocate its views
    and to carry on an ideological struggle. so long as the disputes and
    differences do not lead to disorganisation, so long as they do not impede
    constructive work, split our forces, or hinder the concerted struggle
    against the autocracy and the

    

capitalists. The right to publish Party literature is now

grant ed 

by the Rules
      to every qualified Party organisation. It has now been made incumbent on
      the C.C. of the Party to transport all kinds of Party literature upon the
      demand of five qualified committees, or one-sixth of all such committees
      in the Party. The autonomy of the committees has been defined more
      precisely and their membership declared inviolable, which means that the
      C.C. no longer has the right to remove members from local committees or to
      appoint new members without the consent of the committees themselves. This
      rule admits of only one exception, namely, in cases where two-thirds of
      the organised workers demand the removal of a committee; under the Rules
      adopted by the Third Congress such removal is incumbent on the C.C. if
      two-thirds of its members agree with the decision of the workers. Every
      local committee has been accorded the right to

con firm 

periphery
      organisations as Party organisations. The periphery organisations have
      been accorded the right to nominate candidates for committee
      membership. The boundaries of the Party have been defined more precisely,
      in accordance with the wishes of the Party majority. A single centre has
      been set up instead of two or three. The comrades working in Russia have
      been guaranteed a decided preponderance over the Party’s section
      abroad. In a word, the Third Congress has done everything to remove all
      possibility of charging the Majority with abuse of numerical superiority,
      with mechanical suppression, with despotism of the central bodies of the
      Party, and so on and so forth. Full opportunity has been provided for all
      Social-Democrats to work in co-operation, to join confidently the ranks of
      a single party, broad and virile enough, strong and welded enough to cut
      loose from the old traditions of the study circle days and to wipe out all
      traces of past friction and petty conflicts. Let all members of the
      Social-Democratic Party who really cherish the Party spirit now respond
      to the call of the Third Congress; let its decisions serve as the
      starting-point for restoring the unity of the Party, for eliminating all
      disorganisation, and for consolidating the ranks of the proletariat. We
      are convinced that the class conscious workers, who are best able to
      appreciate the importance of united and concerted work, and who have most

    

keenly felt all the harmful effects of discord, vacillation, and strife, will
      now insist with the utmost vigour on universal and unreserved recognition
      of Party discipline by all Party members, whether rank and file or
      leaders.


While striving, in all its decisions on organisation and tactics, to maintain
continuity with the work of the Second Congress, the Third Congress sought to
take into consideration the new tasks of the moment in its resolutions on the
Party’s preparation for open action; on the necessity for the Party to
participate practically and most energetically in the armed uprising and to give
it leadership; and, finally, on the Party’s attitude towards a provisional
revolutionary government. The Congress drew the attention of all Party members
to the need for taking advantage of all waverings on the part of the government
and of every legal or actual extension of freedom for our activities in order to
strengthen the class organisation of the proletariat and to prepare for its open
action. But apart from these general and basic tasks of the Social-Democratic
working-class party, the present revolutionary moment demands of the Party that
it assume the role of foremost champion of freedom, of vanguard in the armed
uprising against the autocracy. The more stubbornly the tsarist government
resists the people’s strivings towards freedom, the more powerful will be the
force of the revolutionary onset and the more likely the complete victory of
democracy, headed by the working class. The conduct of a victorious revolution
and the defence of its conquests lay tremendous tasks on the shoulders of the
proletariat. But the proletariat will not flinch at these great tasks. It will
contemptuously brush aside all who predict that its victory will bring it
misfortune. The Russian proletariat will be able to do its duty to the very
end. It will be capable of taking the lead of the people’s insurrection. It will
not be daunted by the difficult task of participating in a provisional
revolutionary government, if it has to tackle this task. It will be able to
repel all attempts at counter revolution, to crush ruthlessly all enemies of
freedom, to defend staunchly the democratic republic, and to realise, in a
revolutionary way, the whole of our minimum programme. The Russian proletarians
should not fear such an out come, but should passionately desire it. Our victory
in the

    

coming democratic revolution will be a giant stride forward towards our
socialist goal; we shall deliver all Europe from the oppressive yoke of a
reactionary military power and help our brothers, the class-conscious workers of
the whole world who have suffered so much under the bourgeois reaction and who
are taking heart now at the sight of the successes of the revolution in Russia,
to advance to socialism more quickly, boldly, and decisively. With the help of
the socialist proletariat of Europe, we shall be able, not only to defend the
democratic republic, but to advance with giant strides towards socialism.


Forward, then, comrades workers, to the organised, concerted, and staunch
struggle for freedom!


Long live the revolution!


Long live international revolutionary

In supplementation of the resolution adopted at the beginning of the Congress,
the Central Committee deems it necessary, on the basis of subsequent
information, to add the following. The Congress set the total number of votes in
our Party at 71, namely: 62 from the 31 qualified organisations and 9 from the
central bodies. The Congress did not recognise the Kremenchug, Kazan, and Kuban
committees as qualified Party organisations. The following committees had voting
delegates at the Congress: St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver (at the conclusion of
the Congress), Riga, Northern, Tula, Nizhni-Novgorod, Ural, Samara, Saratov,
the Caucasian League (8 votes, the equivalent of four commit tees), Voronezh,
Nikolayev, Odessa, Polesye, North-Western, Kursk, and Orel-Bryansk. Altogether
21 organisations with 42 votes. In addition there were the C.C. delegates and
the representatives of the C.C. on the Council commanding four votes. All in
all, 46 votes out of 71. Present with consultative voice were: the delegates
from the Archangel Committee, the League of the Urals (a second delegate, who
arrived towards the end of the Congress), the Kazan Committee, the Odessa
Committee, the Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, and Minsk groups, the Editorial Board of
Vperyod, and the Committee of the Organisation Abroad. The delegate of
the Kremenchug Committee had expressed a desire to take part in the Congress
proceedings, but he arrived too late. Furthermore, the delegates to the Third
Congress received a document during the proceedings from which it appears that,
owing to the efforts of the Organising Committee to convene the all-Party
Congress, representatives of the following organisations had arrived abroad:
the St. Petersburg

    

group of the C.C., the Odessa group of the C.C., the Nikolayev Committee, the
Kharkov Committee, the Kiev Committee, the Ekaterinoslav Committee, the Kuban
Commit tee, the Don Committee, the Donets League, the Siberian League, the
periphery of the Moscow Committee, the Sormovo periphery, the Smolensk
Committee, the Crimean League, and the Ukrainian Social-Democratic League. The
document is a letter to “The comrades assembled in Congress at the
invitation of the Organising Committee”, signed by the representatives of
all the above-mentioned organisations. From this it will be seen that the
Organising Committee actually succeeded in making possible an all-Party
congress in the full sense of the word.


Altogether the Congress held 26 sessions. The following questions of tactics
were on the agenda: (1) the armed uprising; (2) the attitude towards the
government’s policy on the eve of and during the revolution; (3) the position on
the peasant movement. Then questions of organisation: (4) the relations between
the workers and the intellectuals within the Party organisations; (5) the Party
Rules. Further, the questions dealing with our relationship towards
other parties and organisations, namely: (6) the relationship to the
breakaway section of
the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, (7) to the non-Russian
Social-Democratic parties, (8) to the “Socialists-Revolutionaries”,
and (9) to the liberals. Further, (10) improvement of propaganda and
agitation; (11) report of the C.C.; (12) reports of delegates from the
local
committees; (13) elections; (14) standing order for publication of the
proceedings and decisions of the Congress, and for the assumption of office by
newly elected functionaries.


The publication of the proceedings of the Congress has been entrusted to a
committee specially elected by the Congress. This committee has already
commenced its work.

The long and stubborn struggle within the R.S.D.L.P. for the Congress
is over at last. The Third Congress has been held. A detailed appraisal of all
its work will be possible only after the proceedings of the Congress have been
published. At present we propose, on the basis of the published

      “Report”[1]

and the impressions of the Congress delegates, to touch on the principal
landmarks of Party development as reflected in the decisions of the Third
Congress.


Three major questions confronted the Party of the class-conscious proletariat
in Russia on the eve of the Third Congress. First, the question of the Party
crisis. Second, the more important question of the form of organisation of the
Party in general. Third, the main question, namely, our tactics in the present
revolutionary situation. Let us see how these questions were dealt with, in the
order of lesser to major.


The Party crisis solved itself by the mere fact that the Congress was
convened. The root cause of the crisis, as every one knows, was the stubborn
refusal of the minority at the Second Congress to submit to the majority. The
agonising and protracted nature of the crisis was conditioned by the delay in
convening the Third Congress, by the fact that there was virtually a split in
the Party, a split that was kept hidden and secret beneath a hypocritical show
of unity, while the Majority was making desperate efforts to find a quick and
direct way out of the impossible situation. The Congress provided this way out
by bluntly asking the Minority whether it accepted the decisions of the
Majority, i.e., whether Party unity was to be restored in actual fact

    

or to be formally and completely broken. The Minority chose the latter
course. It preferred a split. The Council’s refusal to take part in the Congress
in face of the clearly expressed will of the majority of qualified Party
organisations and the refusal of the entire Minority to attend the Congress
represented, as the “Report” states, the final step towards the
split. We shall not dwell here on the formal validity of the Congress, which has
been conclusively evidenced in the “Report”. The argument that the
Congress was invalid, that is, not in accordance with the Party Rules, because
it had not been convened by the Council, can hardly be treated seriously after
all that happened as a result of the Party conflict. It is clear to anyone who
has any idea of the general principles of Party organisation that discipline in
regard to a lower body is conditional upon discipline in regard to the higher
body; the discipline which the Council may command is conditional upon the
Council’s subordination to its principals, that is, the committees and their
totality, the Party Congress. To disagree with this elementary principle is to
come to the absurd conclusion that it is not the agents who are responsible and
accountable to their principals, but vice versa. But this question, we repeat,
is not worth dwelling upon, not only because those do not see the point who do
not wish to see it, but because, from the outset of the split, the dispute on
formalities between the breakaway groups becomes barren, pointless, and
scholastic.


The Minority has split away from the Party; that is an accomplished fact. Some
of them will probably be brought to see by the decisions of the Congress, and
still more by its proceedings, how naive the sundry tales about mechanical
suppression, etc., are; they will come to see that the rights of the Minority in
general are fully guaranteed by the new Rules, that the split is harmful; and
this section of the Minority will re-enter the Party. The other section may
persist for a while in refusing to recognise the Party Congress. As to this
section, we can but hope that it will lose no time in organising itself
internally into a separate organisation with its own tactics and its own
Rules. The sooner it does this, the easier it will he for all, for the broad
mass of the Party workers, to understand the causes of the split and its
implications; the more practicable it will be for our Party to come

    

to a working agreement with the breakaway organisation, depending on the needs
      of local work; and the sooner will a way be found for the inevitable
      future restoration of the Party’s unity.


Let us now pass to the second question, to the general organisational standards
of the Party. The Third Congress made changes of a substantial character in
these standards in the course of revising the Party Rules. The revision affected
three main points: (a) the amendment of Clause 1 of the Rules; (b) the
precise definition of the rights of the C.C. and the autonomy of the committees,
with the extension of the scope of this autonomy; and (c) the creation of a
single centre. As to the famous Clause I of the Rules, this has been
sufficiently clarified in Party literature. The erroneousness of defending in
principle Martov’s vague formula has been demonstrated conclusively. Kautsky’s
attempt to defend this formula from considerations, not of principle, but of
expediency, namely, the conditions of secrecy prevailing in Russia, was not
successful, as indeed it could not be. Anyone who has worked in Russia knows
well that such considerations of expediency do not exist. The only thing now is
to wait for the first results of the Party’s collective work in
implementing the new Clause I of the Rules. We emphasise the fact that a great
deal of work has still to be done for this implementation. No work at all is
needed to enrol oneself as a member of the Party “under the control of a
Party organisation”, since this formula is a mere name and remained such
from the Second Congress to the Third. A wide network of varied Party
organisations, from narrow and secret organisations to the broadest possible and
least secret, can only be built up by dint of long, hard, and efficient
organising work; this is the work that has now devolved upon our C.C. and to a
still greater extent upon our local committees. It is the committees that will
have to confirm the largest number of organisations in the capacity of Party
branches and in the course avoid all unnecessary red tape and faultfinding; it
is the committees that will have to propagate among the workers constantly and
unremittingly the idea of the necessity to create the greatest possible number
of diverse workers’ organisations affiliated to our Party. We cannot deal here
with this interesting question at greater length. We

    

should like to point out, however, that the revolutionary epoch makes it
particularly essential to draw a line of

demarcation’between 

Social-Democracy and all the other democratic parties. But this demarcation is
unthinkable unless sustained efforts are made to increase the number of Party
organisations and strengthen the ties among them. The fortnightly reports
decided upon by the Congress will, among other things, serve to strengthen these
ties. Let us hope that the reports will not remain an unrealised wish; that they
will not cause the practical workers to draw for themselves a horrible picture
of red tape and bureaucracy; that these comrades will start off in a small way
till they develop the habit, by perhaps just reporting the number of members of
every Party organisation, even the smallest and the farthest from the
centre. “The first step is the hardest”, runs the proverb. After
that they will realise how tremendously important it is to acquire the habit
of maintaining regular organisational connections.


We shall not dwell at length on the question of the single centre. The Third
Congress rejected “bicentrism” by as huge a majority as the Second
Congress had adopted it. The reasons will easily be understood by anyone who has
care fully followed the history of the Party. Congresses do not so much create
something new as consolidate results already achieved. At the time of the Second
Congress the Iskra Editorial Board was the recognised pillar of
stability, and it enjoyed dominant influence. The preponderant position of the
comrades in Russia in relation to those resident abroad still seemed
problematical at that stage of the Party’s development. After the Second
Congress it was the Editorial Board abroad that proved to be unstable. The
Party, on the other hand, had developed considerably and unquestionably in
Russia. Under these circumstances the appointment of an Editorial Board of the
Central Organ by the Party C. C. could not but meet with the approval of the
mass of the Party workers.


Finally, the attempts to delimit more precisely the rights of the C.C. and of
the local committees, to draw a line between ideological struggle and
disruptive squabbles, followed inevitably also from the whole course of events
after the Second Congress. We have here a consistent and

    

systematic “accumulation of Party experience”. Plekhanov ’s and
      Lenin’s letter of October 6,

1903,[2]

to the disgruntled editors was an
      attempt to distinguish between irritation and disagreement. The C.C.’s
      ultimatum of November 25, 1903, was a similar attempt in the form of a
      proposal formulated by a group of publicists. The statement issued by the
      C.C. representatives on the Council at the end of January

1903[3]

was an attempt to call upon the whole Party to differentiate the
ideological forms of struggle from boycott, etc. Lenin’s letter of May
26,

       1904,[4]

to
      the members of the C.C. in Russia was an admission of the
      necessity of formally guaranteeing the rights of the
      Minority. The well-known Declaration
      of the Twenty-Two (autumn 1904) was a similar admission in a more
      distinct, detailed, and categorical form. Quite naturally, the Third
      Congress took the same path when it “finally dispelled, dispelled by
      formal decisions, the mirage of a state of siege”. What these
      formal decisions were, viz., the changes in the Party Rules, can be seen
      from the Rules and the “Report”; therefore we shall not repeat
      them here. We shall mention only two things. First, it is to be hoped that
      the guarantee of the right to publish literature and the safeguarding of
      the committees against “cashiering” will help the seceded
      non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations to return to the
      Party. Secondly, in view of the inviolability of committee
      membership, some
      provision had to be made against the possible abuse of this guarantee,
      viz., against being saddled with a perfectly useless committee that was
      “undeposable”. That accounts for Clause 9 of the new Party
      Rules, which sets forth the conditions under which a committee may be
      dissolved upon the demand of two-thirds of the local workers belonging to
      the Party organisations. Let us wait for the guidance of experience before
      deciding to what extent this rule is practical.


Finally, in passing to the last and most important item of the Congress
proceedings, the determination of the Party’s tactics, we must state that this
is not the place to list and

    

analyse the various resolutions. Possibly we shall have to do this in special
articles devoted, to the major· resolutions. Here we need only outline
the general political situation which the Congress had to analyse. Two
alternative courses and outcomes are open to the Russian revolution, which has
begun. The tsarist government may yet succeed by means of trivial concessions
and a “Shipov” constitution in extricating itself from the vice in
which it is now caught. There is little likelihood of such an outcome; but
should the

inter national 

position of the autocracy improve as the result, let
us say, of a relatively favourable peace, should the betrayal by the
bourgeoisie of the cause of freedom be brought quickly to a head by a compromise
with the powers that be, should the inevitable revolutionary outbreak or out
breaks end in the defeat of the people, then such an outcome is likely. We
Social-Democrats and the entire class-conscious proletariat must then face a
long dreary period of harsh, ostensibly constitutional class rule of the
bourgeoisie, with all manner of suppression of the political activity of the
workers and slow economic progress under the new conditions. We shall not lose
heart, of course, whatever the outcome of the revolution; we will take advantage
of every change in conditions to widen and strengthen the independent
organisation of the working-class party, to train the proletariat politically
for renewed struggle. The Congress took this task, among others, into account in
its resolution on open action by the R.S.D.L.P.


The other possible and more probable outcome of the revolution is the
“complete victory of democracy, headed by the working class”, of
which the “Report”

       speaks.[5]

We need hardly say that we will do all
in our power to achieve this result, to eliminate the possibility of the other

alter native. 

The objective historical conditions, too, are shaping themselves
favourably for the Russian revolution. The

sense less 

and shameful war is
tightening the noose round the neck of the tsarist government and creating an
exceptionally favourable situation for the revolutionary destruction of
militarism, for the widespread propaganda of the idea of

    

arming the people in lieu of standing armies and for the speedy effectuation of
      this measure, in view of its support by the masses of the population. The
      long and undivided rule of the autocracy has stored up revolutionary
      energy among the people to a degree perhaps never before known in
      history. Simultaneously with the vast movement of the working class, the
      peasant revolt is spreading and growing, and the petty-bourgeois
      democratic forces, consisting mostly of the professional classes, are
      coming into alliance. The irony of history has punished the autocracy in
      that even friendly social forces, such as clericalism, must organise against
      it to some extent, thereby breaking down or widening the framework of the
      bureaucratic police regime. Discontent among the clergy, the striving
      among them after new forms of life, the emergence of clericals as a
      separate group, the appearance of Christian Socialists and Christian
      Democrats, the resentment of the “heterodox”, sectarians,
      etc.—this all serves the purpose of the revolution and creates
      exceedingly favourable conditions for agitation for the complete
      separation of the Church from the State. The allies of the
      revolution,
      voluntary and involuntary, conscious and unconscious, are growing and
      multiplying hour by hour. The outlook brightens for the victory of the
      people over the autocracy.


This victory is possible only through a heroic effort of all the forces of the
proletariat. It makes demands of Social-Democracy such as history has never
before and nowhere made of a working-class party in an epoch of democratic
revolution. We have before us now, not the well-trodden paths of slow
preparatory work, but the colossal, grandiose tasks of organising the
insurrection, mustering the revolutionary forces of the proletariat, uniting
them with the forces of the whole revolutionary people, launching the armed
attack, and establishing a provisional revolutionary government. In the
resolutions which have now been published for general information, the Third
Congress has sought to take into account these new tasks and give all possible
directives to the organisations of the class-conscious proletariat.


Russia is nearing the denouement of the age-long struggle of all the progressive
popular forces against the autocracy. No one doubts any longer that the
proletariat will take the

    

most energetic part in this struggle and that its participation in the struggle
will decide the outcome of the revolution in Russia. We Social-Democrats will
now have to prove our selves worthy representatives and leaders of the
most revolutionary class, to help it win the fullest freedom, which is
the pledge of our
victorious march towards socialism.

We often hear and read these words nowadays. What. do they actually mean? We
should not idolise the concept of “revolution” (the bourgeois
revolutionaries will assuredly do that and are indeed doing that). We must not
create illusions or myths for ourselves; this would be entirely incompatible
with the materialist conception of history and the class point of view.


Yet there is no question that a struggle of two forces is taking place before
our eyes, a life-and-death struggle of precisely two forces; for the issue at
stake now is the sovereignty of the tsar versus the sovereignty of the
people. These two forces are: revolution and counter-revolution.


Our task, therefore, is to be quite clear in our minds as to (1) the class
content of these social forces, and (2) the real economic content of their
struggle now, at the present time.


The following may be taken as a brief answer to these questions (an answer that
requires to be thoroughly elaborated):


Revolutionary forces==proletariat and peasantry (the peasantry as the chief
representative of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie; the
intelligentsia negligible as a revolutionary factor).


Victorious revolution==democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the
peasantry.


Content of the revolution==the creation of a democratic political system,
economically equivalent to (1) free development of capitalism; (2) abolition of
the survivals of serfdom; (3) the raising of the living and cultural standards
of the masses, especially of the lower strata. [America and Russia, pauperism
and capitalism.]

 
Mythenbildung,[1]

as the inevitable consequence of the historical
    position of the bourgeois democrats! [Cf. the lawyers’
    resolutions.[4]]

All
    are “socialists”....

Umwälzung,[2]

    Umsturz[3]

... Where? Among the intelligentsia? Among the lawyers? Nil.
Only among the proletariat and the p e a s a n t r y.
What can guarantee their

con quests? 

Only the republic, the democratic dictatorship.

We have quite a few Social-Democrats who give way to pessimism every time the
workers suffer a reverse in single battles with the capitalists or with the
government, and who scornfully dismiss all mention of the great and lofty aims
of the working-class movement by pointing to the in adequate degree of our
influence on the masses.Who and what are we, they say, to strive towards such
things? It is purposeless to speak of the role of Social-Democracy as

van guard 

of the revolution when we do not even really know the mood of the masses, when
we are unable to merge with them and to rouse the working masses! The reverses
suffered by the Social-Democrats last May Day have considerably intensified this
mood. Naturally, the Mensheviks, or new Iskrists, have seized this opening to
raise anew the special slogan “To the masses!”—as if in spite, as
if in answer to those who have thought and spoken of the provisional
revolutionary government, of the revolutionary-democratic
dictatorship, etc.


It must be admitted that in this pessimism, and in the conclusions which the
hasty publicists of the new Iskra draw from it, there is one very
dangerous feature that may cause great harm to the Social-Democratic
movement. To be sure, self-criticism is vitally essential to every
live and
virile party. There is nothing more disgusting than smug optimism. There is
nothing more warranted than the urging of attention to the constant, imperative
necessity of deepening and broadening, broadening and deepening, our influence
on the masses, our strictly Marxist propaganda and agitation, our ever-closer
connection with the economic struggle of the working class, etc. Yet, because
such urging is at all times

    

warranted, under all conditions and in all situations, it must not be turned
into special slogans, nor should it justify attempts to build upon it a special
trend in Social- Democracy. A border-line exists here; to exceed the hounds is
to turn this indisputably legitimate urging into a narrowing of the aims and the
scope of the movement, into a doctrinaire blindness to the vital and cardinal
political tasks of the moment.


It is our duty always to intensify and broaden our work and influence among the
masses. A Social-Democrat who does not do this is no Social-Democrat. No branch,
group, or circle can be considered a Social-Democratic organisation if it does
not work to this end steadily and regularly. To a great extent, the purpose of
our strict separation as a distinct and independent party of the proletariat
consists in the fact that we always and undeviatingly conduct this Marxist work
of raising the whole working class, as far as possible, to the level of
Social-Democratic consciousness, allowing no political gales, still less
political changes of scenery, to turn us away from this urgent task. Without
this work, political activity would inevitably degenerate into a game, because
this activity acquires real importance for the proletariat only when and insofar
as it arouses the mass of a definite class, wins its interest, and mobilises it
to take an active, foremost part in events. This work, as we have said, is
always necessary. After every reverse we should bring this to mind again, and
emphasise it, for weakness in this work is always one of the causes of
the proletariat’s defeat. Similarly, we should always call attention to it and
emphasise its importance after every victory, otherwise the victory will be only
a seeming one, its fruits will not be assured, its real significance in the
great struggle for our ultimate goal will be negligible and may even prove
adverse (particularly if a partial victory should slacken our vigilance, lull
our distrust of unreliable allies, and cause us to forgo the right moment for a
renewed and more vigorous at tack on the enemy).


But for the very reason that the work of intensifying and broadening our
influence on the masses is always necessary, after each victory as after each
defeat, in times of political quiescence as in the stormiest periods of
revolution, we should

    

not turn the emphasis upon this work into a special slogan or build upon it any
      special trend if we do not wish to court the risk of descending to
      demagogy and degrading the aims of the advanced and only truly
      revolutionary class. There is and always will be an element of pedagogics
      in the political activity of the Social-Democratic Party. We
      must educate the whole class of wage-workers to the role of
      fighters for the
      emancipation of mankind from all oppression. We must constantly teach more
      and more sections of this class; we must learn to approach the most
      backward, the most undeveloped members of this class, those who are least
      influenced by our science and the science of life, so as to be able to
      speak to them, to draw closer to them, to raise them steadily and
      patiently to the level of Social-Democratic consciousness, without making
      a dry dogma out of our doctrine—to teach them not only from books,
      but through participation in the daily struggle for existence of these
      backward and undeveloped strata of the proletariat. There is, we repeat, a
      certain element of pedagogics in this everyday activity. The
      Social-Democrat who lost sight of this activity would cease to be a
      Social-Democrat. That is true. But some of us often forget, these days,
      that a Social-Democrat who would reduce the tasks of politics to
      pedagogics would also, though for a different reason, cease to be a
      Social-Democrat. Whosoever might think of turning this
      “pedagogics” into a special slogan, of contraposing
    it to “politics”, of building a special trend upon it, and of
    appealing to the masses under this slogan against the
    “politicians” of Social-Democracy, would instantly and
    unavoidably descend to demagogy.


That comparisons are odious is an old axiom. In every comparison a likeness is
drawn in regard to only one aspect or several aspects of the objects or notions
compared, while the other aspects are tentatively and with reservation
abstracted. Let us remind the reader of this commonly known but frequently
ignored axiom and proceed to compare the Social-Democratic Party to a large
school which is at once elementary, secondary, and collegiate. The teaching of
the ABC, instruction in the rudiments of knowledge and in independent thinking,
will never, under any circumstances, be neglected in this big school. But if
anyone sought to invoke the need for teaching the ABC as a pretext for dismissing

    

questions of higher learning, if anyone attempted to offset the
impermanent, dubious, and “narrow” results of this higher learning
(accessible to a much smaller circle of people than those learning the ABC) to
the durable, profound, extensive, and solid results of the elementary school,
he would betray incredible short-sightedness. He might even help to pervert the
whole purpose of the big school, since by ignoring higher education he would
simply be making it easier for charlatans, demagogues, and
reactionaries to mislead the people who had only learned the ABC. Or
again, let us compare the Party
to an army. Neither in peace-time nor in war-time dare we neglect the training
of recruits, dare we neglect rifle drill, or the dissemination of the rudiments
of military science as intensively and extensively as possible among the
masses. But if those directing the manoeuvres or actual

     battles.... [1]

Geneva, June 2, 1905


To the International Socialist Bureau


Dear Comrades,


A few weeks ago the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party held its Third
Congress. French and German translations of the Congress resolutions will
appear shortly in a special pamphlet,[1]

which will be forwarded to
the Bureau. By decision of the Congress, Iskra has ceased to be the
Central Organ of the Party. Henceforth, the weekly,
Proletary,[2]

published in Geneva, will be the Central Organ.


The Central Committee, which is, according to the new Rules, the sole central
body of our Party, will appoint the Party’s representative on the International
Bureau. Please address all future communications to Comrade Ulyanov,
Representative of the Central Committee, 3, Rue de la Colline, Genève.


Accept, dear comrades, our fraternal greetings.


For the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P.


N. Lenin (V. Ulyanov)


 
Notes
 
 



[1]

The “special pamphlet” referred to appeared on
June 12 (25), 1905, in French, as a supplement to the newspaper Le
Socialiste, Central Organ of the Socialist Party of France, and in German
in the Munich

   

edition Bericht über den III. Parteitag der S.-D.A.-P.R.
(Report on the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and
the Resolutions of the Congress). The issue of these pamphlets was announced in
Proletary, No. 15, September 5 (August 23), 1905, in the Party
 News column.





[2]

Proletary (The Proletarian)—underground
Bolshevik weekly, Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P., founded in accordance with a
resolution of the Third Party Congress. By a decision of the plenary meeting of
the Party Central Committee of April 27 (May 10), 1905, Lenin was appointed
Editor-in-Chief.


Proletary was published in Geneva from May 14 (27) to November 12
(25), 1905. Twenty-six numbers were put out. V. V. Vorovsky, A. V. Lunacharsky,
and M. S. Olminsky regularly helped in the work of the Editorial
Board. Proletary carried on the line of the old, Leninist,
Iskra and preserved complete continuity with the Bolshevik newspaper
Vperyod.


Lenin wrote over fifty articles and minor items for the newspaper. His articles
in Proletary were reprinted in the local Bolshevik periodicals and
published in leaflet form.


Shortly after Lenin’s departure for Russia in November 1905 Proletary
suspended publication. The last two issues of Proletary (Nos. 25 and
26) were edited by Vorovsky.

The Second Congress of the Zemstvo representatives was held in Moscow a few
weeks ago. Russian newspapers are not allowed to print a word about it. The
English newspapers report numerous details received from eyewitnesses who
attended the Congress and who telegraphed, not only its decisions, but the
substance of the speeches made by the representatives of the various
shadings. The decisions of the 132 Zemstvo representatives amount in their
essence to an acceptance of the constitutional programme published by Mr. Struve
and analysed by us in Vperyod, No. 18 (“Political

     Sophisms”).[1]

This programme provides for a bicameral popular legislature and the retention of
the monarchy. The Upper House is to consist of deputies from the Zemstvos and
the municipal councils, the Lower is to be elected on the basis of universal,
direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot. Our legal newspapers, forced to
keep silent about the Congress, have begun to publish details of the programme,
which makes it all the more important now to analyse it.


As regards the Congress, we shall probably have occasion more than once to
return to it. For the time being we shall recount, on the authority of the
English newspapers, a particularly interesting event at this Congress, namely,
the disagreement, or split, between the “liberal”, or opportunist or
Shipov, party and the “radical” party. The disagreement arose over
the question of universal suffrage, to which the former party is opposed. On
Sunday, May 7 (April 24), it transpired that 52 members of the Congress backed
Shipov and were ready to walk out if the Congress declared for

    

universal suffrage. On Monday a score among them voted with the majority for
      universal suffrage. Thereupon a resolution on the convocation of a
      Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal suffrage was adopted
      unanimously, a considerable majority declaring for direct elections and
      for the non-admission (to the Constituent Assembly) of representatives of
      the municipal councils and Zemstvos. Thus, for the time being, the
    followers of Shipov have been defeated at the Congress of the Zemstvo
    representatives. The majority has come to the conclusion that the only way
    to preserve the monarchy and prevent revolution is to grant universal,
    direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot, rendered innocuous through
    indirect and unequal elections to one of the two houses.


The opinion of the English conservative bourgeoisie on this Congress and on this
decision is most instructive. “It is quite impossible,” writes The
Times, “for foreigners to gauge the political importance of this
remarkable meeting until we learn from trustworthy authority what measure of
support it commands amongst the huge mass of the Russian people. It may mark the
beginning of a real constitutional reform; it may be the first stage on the road
to revolution; it may be a mere fire of straw which the bureaucracy have
tolerated because they know it will burn harmlessly out.”


A remarkably true characterisation! Indeed, the further course of the Russian
revolution is far from being determined by an event like this
Congress. “The support of the huge mass of the people” is still a
moot question, not as regards the actual fact of the people’s support (which is
assured), but rather as regards the strength of this support. If the government
puts down the uprising, then the liberal Congress will indeed have been a fire
of straw. And the moderate European liberals, of course, advise the golden
mean: a moderate constitution which would stave off the revolution. The
government’s confusion, however, fills them with dismay and discontent. The ban
on publishing the decisions of the Congress puzzles The Times, since
the delegates, now dispersed to their home districts, have every means of
informing the entire Russian public of their decisions. “To have refused
to allow the Congress to meet, to have arrested its members when they did meet,
or to have used them as a screen

    

for a sham reform would all have been intelligible courses. But to let them meet
and disperse, and then to try and silence them is merely
inept.”


The stupidity of the tsarist government, as proved by its confusion and
impotence (for confusion at a revolutionary moment is a sure sign of impotence),
fills European capital with grave concern (The Times is a mouthpiece of
“the City”, the high financiers of the world’s richest city). This
confusion increases the probability of a real, victorious revolution sweeping
everything in its path, a revolution that strikes terror into the hearts of the
European bourgeoisie. The latter blames the autocracy for losing its head and
the liberals for making “immoderate” demands! Upon the question
(universal suffrage) “which the ... most experienced Legislatures in
Europe would hesitate to decide in the course of a prolonged session [fumes
The Times]—they seem to have practically reversed their
attitude in five short days and adopted extremist decisions. European capital
advises Russian capital to follow its example. We do not doubt that this advice
will be taken—but hardly before the autocracy has had its power
curtailed. The European bourgeoisie in its day fought against
absolutism still more “immoderately”, by still more revolutionary
methods than the Russian bourgeoisie does in its day. The
“obduracy” of the Russian autocracy and the immoderacy of Russian
liberalism are due, not to their inexperience, as The Times seems to
imply, but to factors beyond their control—the international situation,
foreign policy, and most of all to that heritage of Russian history which has
driven the autocracy to the wall and piled up under its dominance contradictions
and conflicts never known in Western Europe. The proverbial stability and
strength of Russian tsarism in the past necessarily condition the force of the
revolutionary assault upon it. This is most unpleasant to all gradualists and
opportunists; it terrifies even many Social-Democrats from the tail-ender camp,
but such is the fact.


The Times deplores the defeat of Shipov. Why, only last November he was
the undisputed chief of the reform party and now... “so rapidly does
revolution devour its children Poor Shipov! To suffer defeat and be branded as
the evil genius of the revolution—could fate be more unjust? The

    

“radicals” who voted Shipov down at the Congress of the Zemstvo
      representatives shock The Times, which cries in horror that they
    adhere to the theoretical principles of the French Convention. The doctrine
    of equality, of equal rights for all citizens, of the sovereignty of the
    people, etc., “has been proved by many... experiments to be, perhaps,
    the most prolific of evil amongst all the brood of disastrous sophistries
    which Jean Jacques Rousseau bequeathed to mankind. It is the tap-root of
    Jacobinism, fatal by its mere presence to the growth of just and wholesome
    reforms.”


The opportunists of liberalism touchingly embrace with the opportunists of
Social-Democracy in their partiality for employing the bogy of
“Jacobinism”. In an epoch of democratic revolution only hopeless
reactionaries or

hope less 

philistines can raise the bogy of Jacobinism.

The naval battle in the Korea Strait has captured the attention of the political
press the world over. At first the tsarist government tried to conceal the
bitter truth from its loyal subjects, but it soon realised the hopelessness of
such an attempt. In any case it would have been impossible to conceal the utter
rout of the entire Russian navy.


In appraising the political significance of the last naval battle, we can only
repeat what we said in Vperyod,

No. 2,[1]

on the fall of Port
Arthur. The complete military debacle of tsarist Russia had become evident by
then, but the Baltic squadron still gave the Russian patriots a ray of
hope. All realised that the outcome of the war depended on victory at sea. The
autocracy understood that an adverse outcome of the war would be tantamount to a
victory of the “internal enemy”, viz., of the revolution. It,
therefore, staked its all. Hundreds of millions of rubles were spent on hastily
dispatching the Baltic fleet, motley crews were scraped together, final
preparations to get the warships into sea trim were rushed through, and old tubs
were added to the new and powerful battle-ships to increase the total number of
craft. The great armada—as huge and unwieldy, as absurd,

help less, 

and
monstrous as the whole Russian Empire—put to sea, expending a fortune in
coal and maintenance, making itself the laughing-stock of Europe, especially
after its brilliant victory over the fishing smacks, and grossly violating all
the usages and principles of neutrality. According to the most conservative
estimates this armada cost nearly 300,000,000 rubles, besides 100,000,000 rubles
on the expedition.

    

 Altogether 400,000,000 rubles were thrown away on this last war
gamble of the tsarist autocracy.


Now this last gamble, too, has failed. Everyone had expected the defeat of the
Russian fleet, but no one had thought it would be so crushing. Like a horde of
savages, the Russian ships flung themselves headlong upon the Japanese fleet,
which was magnificently armed and equipped with the most up-to-date means of
defence. After a two-day battle, thirteen of Russia’s twenty warships manned by
from twelve to fifteen thousand, were sunk or destroyed, four were captured,
and only one (the Almaz) escaped and reached Vladivostok. More than
half the crews were killed or drowned, and Rozhdestvensky “himself”
and his right-hand man, Nebogatov, were taken prisoner, while the Japanese fleet
came out of the engagement unscathed, except for the loss of three destroyers.


Russia’s naval strength has been completely destroyed. The war has been lost
irretrievably. The complete expulsion of the Russian troops from Manchuria and
the seizure of Sakhalin and Vladivostok by the Japanese are now only a matter of
time. We are witnessing, not just a military defeat, but the complete military
collapse of the autocracy.


With every new blow struck by the Japanese, the significance of this collapse,
as the collapse of the entire political system of tsarism, grows clearer both
to Europe and to the whole Russian people. Everything is up in arms against the
autocracy: the wounded national pride of the big and petty bourgeoisie, the
outraged pride of the army, the bitter feeling over the loss of hundreds of
thousands of young lives in a senseless military adventure, the resentment
against the embezzlement of hundreds of millions from the public funds, the
fears of an inevitable financial collapse and a protracted economic crisis as a
result of the war, and the dread of a formidable people’s revolution which (in
the opinion of the bourgeoisie) the tsar could and should have avoided by
means of timely and “reasonable” concessions. The demand for peace
is spreading far and wide. The liberal press is indignant. Even the most
moderate elements, like the landowners of the “Shipov” trend, are
beginning to utter threats,and even the sycophantic Novoye Vremya is
demanding the immediate convening of representatives of the people.

 

The European bourgeoisie, that most faithful prop of the tsarist government, is
      also beginning to lose patience. It is alarmed at the inevitable
      realignment in international relations, at the growing power of the young
      and fresh Japan, and the loss of a military ally in Europe. It is disturbed over the fate of the thousands of millions which it has so
      generously lent to the autocracy. It is seriously perturbed by the
      revolution in Russia, which is unduly exciting the European proletariat
      and may lead to a revolutionary conflagration on a world
      scale. In the name
      of “friendship” with tsarism it appeals to its common sense,
      insists on the necessity of peace—peace with Japan, and peace with
      the liberal Russian bourgeoisie. Europe does not for a moment shut its
      eyes to the fact that peace with Japan can now be bought only at a very
      high price; but it figures out in sober and business-like fashion that
      every extra month of war abroad and of revolution at home is bound to
      raise the price still higher and increase the danger of a revolutionary
      explosion that would blow the entire policy of “concessions”
      away like whiffs of smoke. Europe understands that it is terribly difficult, almost impossible, for the autocracy to call a halt now—it
      has gone too far for that; and so this bourgeois Europe tries to reassure
      itself and its ally with roseate dreams.


The following, for example, is from a short article by Cornély entitled
“The End of an Epic”, which appeared in Le Siècle,
·a newspaper of the patriotic French bourgeoisie:
“Now with the Russians beaten at sea after having been defeated on land,
it is incumbent upon their government to conclude peace and reorganise its armed
forces. Adventurist governments are sometimes compelled, on the strength of
their pretensions or by considerations of security, to involve the peoples over
which they rule in war. Since they have staked their very existence on a
victorious outcome, they demand sacrifice upon sacrifice from their peoples,
thus leading them to ultimate disaster. Such was the history of our two empires
in France. Such would have been the his tory of the third empire, if its
establishment in our country had met with success.


“Such, on the contrary, is not the position of the Russian Government;
this government is deeply rooted among the Russian people, so that common
misfortunes do not divide

    

the government and the people but only cement the bonds between them. A Caesar
vanquished is no longer Caesar. An unfortunate tsar may yet remain august and
popular.”


Alack and alas! The braggadocio of this chauvinistic French shopkeeper is
“all too obvious”. His assurances that the war has caused no rift
between the Russian Government and the people are at such variance with the
generally known facts that one can only smile, as at some naive and innocent
ruse. To warn his friend and ally, the Russian autocrat, of the inevitable ruin
towards which he, like a true “Caesar”, is heading blindly and
doggedly, the French bourgeois kindly assures this Caesar that he need
not resemble other Caesars, that he has a different, a better way
out. We soon
believe what we desire. The French bourgeoisie is so desirous of having a
powerful ally in the person of the tsar that it comforts itself with the
romantic fable that misfortune unites the Russian people with its tsar.
M. Cornély does not take this fable seriously himself, and
still less should we.


Not only the Caesarian governments were given to adventurism, but also the
governments of the most legitimate monarchs of a most ancient dynasty. There has
been more adventurism in the Russian autocracy, which is a whole century behind
the times, than in any of the French empires. It was sheer adventurism that made
the autocracy plunge the people into this senseless and shameful war. Now the
autocracy is facing the end it deserves. The war has laid bare all its sores,
revealed its rottenness to the core, proved its complete alienation from the
people, and destroyed the sole pillars of its Caesarian rule. The war has proved
a stern trial. The people have already passed sentence on this government of
brigands. The revolution will execute the sentence.

The rise of political parties is one of the most interesting and characteristic
features of our interesting epoch. The old order, the autocracy, is falling to
pieces. Increasing sections, not only of so-called “society”, i.e.,
the bourgeoisie, but also of the “people”, i.e., the working class
and the peasantry, have begun to reflect on the kind of new order that has to be
built and on the way to build it. For the class-conscious proletariat these
attempts of the various classes to frame a programme and organise the political
struggle are of momentous importance. Although these attempts largely originate
from individual “figures” responsible to no one and leading no one,
and are therefore often fortuitous, arbitrary, and at times bombastic, the
basic interests and tendencies of the big social classes, broadly speaking,
assert themselves with irresistible force. Out of the seeming chaos of
declarations, demands, and platforms there clearly emerge the political
physiognomy of our bourgeoisie and its real (not only specious) political
programme. The proletariat is obtaining increasingly more material by which to
judge how the Russian bourgeoisie, which now talks of political action, is
really going to act—what stand it will take in the decisive revolutionary
struggle towards which Russia is so rapidly heading.


Valuable material for studying the policy of the bourgeoisie is sometimes
offered by Osvobozhdeniye, published abroad, which is able to review
the numerous public utterances of the Russian liberals without censorship
restrictions. The Programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League, which this

    

journal has just published (or reprinted from

   Novosti[1]

of April 5)
with instructive commentaries by Mr. P. S., is an excellent
addendum to the
resolutions of the Zemstvo congresses and to the Osvobozhdeniye
liberals’ draft constitution, of which we wrote in Vperyod,

       No. 18.[2]

“The drafting and voting of this programme,” as
Mr. P. S. justly remarks,
“is a big step towards the creation of a Russian
Constitutional-Democratic Party.”


For the Russian liberals this is unquestionably a big step, which stands out in
the long list of liberal activities. Nevertheless, how little this big
“step” of the liberals is, as compared with what is needed for
building a real party, as compared even with what Social-Democracy has already
done to this end. The bourgeoisie has far greater freedom of legal expression
than the proletariat, incomparably more intellectual forces and financial means,
and far greater facilities for party organisation; yet we still have before us
a “party” without an official name, without a common, distinct, and
lucid programme, without worked-out tactics, without a party organisation, a
“party” which, according to the competent testimony of
Mr. P. S.,
consists of the “Zemstvo group"and the Osvobozhdeniye
League,i.e., of an unorganised conglomeration of individuals plus an
organisation. But perhaps the members of the Zemstvo group are “party
members” in the now famous sense that they accept the programme and work
“under the control of a party organisation”, of a group of the
Osvobozhdeniye League? Such a conception of party membership is as
convenient and suitable to the liberals and as natural a part of the liberal
political pattern as it is alien to the whole spirit of Social-Democracy. Such a
conception of party (expressed not in written Rules, but in the actual structure
of that “party”) implies, among other things, that the organised members,
i.e., the members of the Osvobozhdeniye League, stand, in their
majority, for a unicameral system, while at the same time rejecting it
in their programme, passing the whole question over in silence in deference to
the unorganised membership, to the “Zemstvo group”, which favours a
bicameral system. The balance of

    

“forces”, one might say, is providential for the politically active
      bourgeoisie. The organised intellectuals propose, and the unorganised
      businessmen, money-bags, and capitalists dispose.


While heartily welcoming the Programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League,
Mr. P. S., in principle, defends both the vagueness, inadequacy, and
incompleteness of the programme and its organisational haziness and silence on
tactics— all for reasons of “Realpolitik”! We shall revert
to this in comparable conception, so singularly characteristic of the essence of
bourgeois liberalism, and shall now proceed to examine the basic principles of
the liberal programme.


The party, as we have said, has no official designation. Mr. P. S. calls it by
the name under which, I believe, it goes in the columns of our legal newspapers
of the liberal trend, namely, “Constitutional-Democratic
Party”. Unimportant though the question of name may appear at first
glance, here too we immediately find material that explains why the bourgeoisie,
unlike the proletariat, must content itself with political vagueness
and even defend it “in principle”; it “must” do this,
not only on account of the subjective moods or qualities of its leaders, but by
reason of the objective conditions governing the existence of the bourgeois
class as a whole. The name “Constitutional-Democratic Party”
immediately calls to mind the well-known adage that speech was given to man in
order that he might conceal his thoughts. The name “G.D.P.” was invented
to conceal the monarchist nature of the party. Indeed, who does not
know that this entire party, in the person both of its master section, the
Zemstvo group, and of the Osvobozhdeniye League, stands for the
monarchy? Neither section so much as mentions the question of the republic,
which they consider “idle talk”, while their draft constitution
bluntly and unequivocally accepts the monarchy as the form of government. We
have therefore to do with a party that advocates a constitutional monarchy, a
party of constitutional monarchists. This is a fact of which there is not the
slightest doubt and which cannot be dismissed by any arguments about acceptance
“in principle” of the idea of a republic (though we have heard no
such arguments yet from the “Constitutional-Democrats”!), since the issue
is not acceptance of the

    

republic purely “in principle”, but acceptance in practical
politics, acceptance of the will to achieve the republic and of the necessity to
struggle for it.


The fact is that the bourgeois gentlemen cannot call them selves by
their real name yet, any more than they can go out into the street naked. They
cannot tell the truth openly; they cannot aussprechen was ist (speak
out the truth), for that would mean admitting one of the most outrageous and
pernicious of political privileges, it would mean admitting their
anti-democratism. No bourgeoisie in struggle for political liberty can admit
this, and not only because it would be disgraceful, scandalous, and
indecent. Nothing is too in decent for bourgeois politicians where their
interests are concerned. But their interests at the moment
demand liberty, and liberty cannot be won without the people,
and the backing of
the people cannot be secured unless one calls oneself a “democrat”
(=an adherent of the rule of the people), unless one conceals one’s
monarchism.


And so the class position of the bourgeoisie inevitably gives rise to an
inherent instability and falsity in the very formulation of its basic political
tasks. The struggle for freedom, for the abolition of the ancient privileges of
the autocracy, is incompatible with the defence of the privileges of private
property, since these privileges entail “gentle handling” of the
monarchy. The real programme of the monarchist constitution, therefore, is
draped in the fine, airy raiment of a democratic constitution. And this
embellishment of the programme’s real content with a display of tawdry tinsel is
called “Realpolitik”.... Thus, the ideologist of the
liberal bourgeoisie speaks with inimitable contempt and sublime self-complacency
about the “theoretical self-indulgence” which the
“representatives of the extreme parties” are practising
(Osvobozhdeniye, No. 69-70, p. 308). The Realpolitiker of
the bourgeoisie do not want to indulge in talk or even in day-dreams of the
republic because they do not want to struggle for the republic. For this
reason, however, they feel the irresistible urge to edify the people
with the enticement of “democracy”. They do not want to deceive
themselves with regard to their inability to renounce the monarchy, and so they
needs must deceive the people by keeping silent about their monarchism.

 

The name of a party, as can be seen, is not such an incidental and unimportant
      affair as one might think at first glance. Sometimes the very showiness
      and pretentiousness of the name betray the inherent flaw in a party’s
      entire programme and tactical line. The deeper an ideologist of the big
      bourgeoisie feels himself devoted to the monarchy, the louder he calls
      upon heaven to witness that he is a democrat. The more an ideologist of
      the petty bourgeoisie reflects its instability and its incapacity to wage
      a consistent, steadfast struggle for the democratic revolution and for
      socialism, the more ardently he holds forth on the party of the
      “Socialists-Revolutionaries”, of which it has been aptly said
      that its socialism is anything but revolutionary, and its
      revolutionariness anything but socialist.. All we need now is for the
      adherents of the autocracy to call themselves (as they have on more than
      one occasion attempted to do) “people’s party”, and we shall
      have a complete picture of the metamorphosis which class interests undergo
      on political signboards.


The signboard of the liberal bourgeoisie (or the programme of the
Osvobozhdeniye League) starts, as befits a signboard, with a striking
preamble: “The Osvobozhdeniye League finds that the grave
external and internal crisis through which Russia is passing has become so acute
at the present time that the people must take its solution into their own hands
in conjunction with the other social groups opposed to the existing regime.”


And so, let the power pass into the hands of the people, long live the autocracy
of the people in place of the autocracy of the tsar. Isn’t that it, gentlemen?
Isn’t that what democratism demands?


No, this is theoretical self-indulgence and a failure to understand practical
politics. All power is now in the hands of the absolute monarchy. Ranged against
it is the people, namely, the proletariat and the peasantry, who have launched
the struggle, are waging it furiously, and
...very likely will maintain their zeal until they have completely overthrown the
enemy. But ranged alongside the “people” are “the other social
groups”, viz., “society”, i.e., the bourgeoisie, the
landowners, the capitalists, and the professional intelligentsia. Thus, the
power is to

    

be divided into three equal parts. One-third is to be left to the monarchy,
another goes to the bourgeoisie (an Upper House based on indirect, and as far as
possible actually unequal and non-universal, suffrage), while the remaining
third goes to the people (a Lower House on the basis of suffrage that is
universal, etc.). This will be a “square deal” providing adequate
protection for private property and making it possible to use the organised
power of the monarchy (the army, bureaucracy, and police) against the people,
should they show “zeal” for any of the “unreasonable”
demands put forward by the “representatives of the extreme parties out of
sheer theoretical self-indulgence”. This square deal, which reduces the
revolutionary people to a harmless minority of one-third, is presented as
“a radical reform on democratic principles”, and not at all on the
principles of monarchism or of bourgeois privilege.


How is this deal to be put through? By means of honest brokerage. Mr. Struve
predicted this long ago in his preface to the Witte Memorandum when he said that
it is always the moderate parties that gain from the intensification of the
struggle between the extreme parties. The struggle between the autocracy and the
revolutionary people is gaining in intensity. One has to manoeuvre between the
one and the other, enlisting the support of the revolutionary people against the
autocracy (with the enticement of “democracy”) and the support of the
monarchy against the “excesses” of the revolutionary people. By
skilful manoeuvring a deal like that should come off, with the bourgeoisie
getting at least a “third” share in any case, while the shares
allotted to the people and the autocracy would depend on the outcome of the
decisive struggle between them. Whose backing should be sought most will depend
on the exigencies of the moment— such is the essence of the huckstering
tactics, that is to say, “practical” politics.


At present all power is still in the hands of the autocracy. The thing to do,
therefore, is to say that the people must take power into their hands. The thing
to do, therefore, is to call yourself a democrat, to put forward a demand for
“the immediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly on the basis of
suffrage that is universal, etc., for the purpose of drawing up a Russian
constitution”. The people now

    

are unarmed, disunited, unorganised, and helpless in the face of the absolute
      monarchy. A popular Constituent Assembly will rally them and become a
      great force which will oppose the power of the tsar. Only then, when the
      power of the tsar and the united force of the revolutionary people
      confront each other, will the bourgeoisie have its day; then only will
    it be possible to “co-ordinate” these two
    forces with positive chances of success and ensure the most advantageous
    result for the propertied classes.


Such is the plan of the practical politicians of liberalism. Not a foolish plan
at all. It deliberately provides for the preservation of the monarchy and the
admission of a Constituent Assembly of the whole people only alongside of the
monarchy. The bourgeoisie does not want to have the existing government
overthrown or the monarchy replaced by a republic. Therefore, the Russian
bourgeoisie (on the pattern of the German bourgeoisie of 1848) stands for a
“deal” between the people and the throne. Such a policy
can be successful only if neither of these parties engaged in the
struggle, neither the
people nor the throne, is able to win the day, only if their strength is
balanced. Then and only then will the bourgeoisie be able to join with the
monarchy and keep a tight hold on the people, compel them to put up with one
“third”—or perhaps one-hundredth part, of the power. The Constituent
Assembly of the whole people will be just strong enough to make the tsar grant a
constitution, but it will not and must not (from the point of view of
the bourgeoisie’s interests) be any stronger. It must only counterbalance the
monarchy, but not overthrow it; it must leave the material instruments of power
(the army, etc.) in the hands of the monarchy.


The Osvobozhdeniye Leaguers laugh at the Shipovists for wanting to give
the tsar the power of authority and the people the power of opinion. But is not
their position essentially identical with that of the Shipovists? They do not
want to give the people all the power either; they, too, stand for a
compromise between the power of the tsar and the opinion of the people!


We thus see that the interests of the bourgeoisie as a class quite naturally and
inevitably lead it at the present revolutionary moment to advance the slogan of
a Constituent

    

Assembly of the people, but in no case the slogan of a provisional
revolutionary government. The first slogan is or has become the slogan of
the policy of compromise, huckstering, and brokerage; the second is the slogan
of revolutionary struggle. The first is the slogan of the monarchist
bourgeoisie, the second, the slogan of the revolutionary people. The
first slogan
makes it possible chiefly to preserve the monarchy, despite the revolutionary
onset of the people; the second offers the straight road to the republic. The
first leaves the power with the tsar, restricted only by public opinion; the
second is the only slogan which consistently and unreservedly leads to the
sovereignty of the people in the full sense of the word.


Only this radical difference in the political aims of the liberal bourgeoisie
and the revolutionary proletariat can explain a number of secondary features in
the Osvobozhdeniye programme besides those mentioned above. Only in
the light of this difference is it possible to understand, for example, why the
Osvobozhdeniye adherents require the reservation that the
decisions of their League are to be “regarded as binding only
insofar as political conditions remain unchanged”, and that the programme
allows for “a provisional and conditional element”. This reservation
(developed at length and with keen “relish” in the commentaries of
Mr. P. S.) is absolutely essential for a party of “compromise”
between the people and tsarism. It is a reservation that makes it as clear as
daylight that in pursuance of their line of huckstering (“practical”)
politics the Osvobozhdeniye Leaguers will throw over a good many of
their democratic demands. Their programme is not an expression of steadfast
convictions (a quality alien to the bourgeoisie), not some thing designated to
be fought for. Rather, their programme is simply a haggling price,
fixed beforehand with a definite view to “reduction”, depending on
which of the warring parties can “hold out” longer. The
Constitutional-“Democratic” (read:
constitutional-monarchist)
bourgeoisie will strike a bargain with tsarism at a cheaper price than its
present programme—there is no doubt of that, and the class-conscious
proletariat should have no illusions on that score. Hence Mr. P. S.’s hostility
towards the division into a minimum programme and a maximum programme, and
towards

    

“firm decisions of programme in general”. Hence, his assurances that
      the programme of the Osvobozhdeniye League (purposely couched,
    not in terms of definite demands precisely formulated, but in the form of a
    literary, approximative description of the demands) “is
      more than adequate for a party engaged in practical
    politics”. Hence, the omission of any mention of the arming of the
    people in the programme of the monarchist “democrats”, the
    avoidance of any definitely formulated demand for the disestablishment of
    the Church, the insistence on the impracticability of abolishing indirect
    taxes, the substitution of cultural self-determination of the oppressed
    nationalities for their political self-determination. Hence, the naïvely
    frank admission that democracy and the interests of capital are linked
    together; that instead of “protection for enterprises and businessmen,
    there must be greater protection for the development of the productive
    forces of the people”; that “industrial prosperity”, etc.,
    must be promoted. hence, the reduction of the agrarian reform to the level
    of a purely bureaucratic “granting” of land to the peasants with
    an absolute guarantee that the landowners will be
    “compensated” for the lands assigned to the peas
    ants. In other words, the sanctity of “property” derived from
    bondage and serfdom is to be upheld at all costs. All this, we repeat, is
    the natural and inevitable result of. the position of the bourgeoisie as a
    class in modern society. All this confirms the radical difference between
    the proletarian policy of revolutionary struggle and the bourgeois policy of
    liberal brokerage.

In publishing the Report on the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. in Yiddish, the
Editorial Board of the Party Central Organ considers it necessary to say a few
words in connection with this publication.


The conditions under which the class-conscious proletariat of the whole world
lives tend to create the closest bonds and increasing unity in the systematic
Social-Democratic struggle of the workers of the various nationalities. The
great slogan “Workers of all countries, unite I”, which was
proclaimed for the first time more than half a century ago, has now become more
than the slogan of just the Social-Democratic parties of the different
countries. This slogan is being increasingly embodied both in the unification of
the tactics of international Social-Democracy and in the building of
organisational unity among the proletarians of the various nationalities who are
struggling under the yoke of one and the same despotic state for freedom and
socialism.


In Russia the workers of all nationalities, especially those of non-Russian
nationality, endure an economic and political oppression such as obtains in no
other country. The Jewish workers, as a disfranchised nationality, not only
suffer general economic and political oppression, but they also suffer under the
yoke which deprives them of elementary civic rights. The heavier this yoke, the
greater the need for the closest possible unity among the proletarians of the
different nationalities; for without such unity a victorious struggle against
the general oppression is impossible. The more the predatory tsarist autocracy
strives to sow the seeds of discord, distrust and enmity among the nationalities
it oppresses, the more abominable its policy of inciting the

    

ignorant masses to savage pogroms becomes, the more does the duty devolve upon
      us, the Social-Democrats, to rally the isolated Social-Democratic parties
      of the different nationalities into a single Russian
    Social-Democratic Labour Party.


The First Congress of our Party, held in the spring of 1898, set itself the aim
of establishing such unity. To dispel any idea of its being national in
character, the Party called itself “Rossiiskaya” and not

“Russkaya”.[1]

The organisation of Jewish workers—the
Bund—affiliated with the Party as an autonomous section. Unfortunately,
from that moment the unity of the Jewish and non-Jewish Social-Democrats within
the single party was destroyed. Nationalist ideas began to spread among the
leading members of the Bund, ideas which are in sharp contradiction to the
entire world view of Social-Democracy. Instead of trying to draw the Jewish and
the non-Jewish workers closer together, the Bund embarked upon a policy of
weaning the former away from the latter; at its congresses it claimed a separate
existence for the Jews as a nation. Instead of carrying on the work begun by
the First Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Party towards still closer
unity between the Bund and the Party, the Bund moved a step away from the
Party. First, it withdrew from the united organisation of the R.S.D.L.P. abroad
and set up an independent organisation abroad; later, it withdrew from the
R.S.D.L.P. as well, when the Second Congress of our Party in 1903 refused by a
considerable majority to recognise the Bund as sole representative of the
Jewish proletariat. The Bund held to its position, claiming not only that it was
the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat, but that no territorial
limits were set to its activities. Naturally, the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. could not accept such conditions, since in a number of regions, as,
for instance, in South Russia, the organised Jewish proletariat constitutes part
of the general Party organisation. Ignoring that stand, the Bund with drew from
the Party and thereby broke the unity of the Social-Democratic proletariat,
despite the work that had been

    

carried out in common at the Second Congress, and despite the Party Programme
and Rules.


At its Second and Third Congresses the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
expressed its firm conviction that the Bund’s withdrawal from the Party was a
grave and deplorable mistake on its part. The Bund’s mistake is a result of its
basically untenable nationalist views; the result of its groundless claim to be
the sole, monopolistic representative of the Jewish proletariat, from which the
federalist principle of organisation necessarily derives; the result of its
Long-standing policy of keeping aloof and separate from the Party. We are
convinced that this mistake must be rectified and that it will be rectified as
the movement continues to grow. We consider ourselves ideologically at one with
the Jewish Social-Democratic proletariat. After the Second Congress our Central
Committee pursued a non-nationalist policy; it took pains that such committees
should be set up (Polesye, North-Western) as would unite all the local workers,
Jewish as well as non-Jewish, into a single whole. At the Third Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. a resolution was adopted providing for the publication of literature
in Yiddish. In fulfilment of that resolution we are now issuing a complete
translation into Yiddish of the Report on the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.,
which has appeared in Russian. The Report will show the Jewish
workers—both those who are now in our Party and those who are temporarily
out of it—how our Party is progressing. The Report will show the Jewish
workers that our Party is already emerging from the internal crisis from which
it has been suffering since the Second Congress. It will show them what the
actual aspirations of our Party are and what its attitude is towards the
Social-Democratic parties and organisations of the other nationalities, as well
as the attitude of the entire Party and its central body to its component
parts. Finally, it will show them—and this is most important—the
tactical directives that were drawn up by the Third Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. with regard to the policy of the entire class-conscious proletariat
in the present revolutionary situation.


Comrades! The hour of political struggle against the tsarist autocracy is
drawing near—the struggle of the proletariat for the freedom of all
classes and peoples in Russia,

    

for the freedom of the proletarian drive towards socialism. Terrible trials are
      in store for us. The outcome of the revolution in Russia depends on our
      class-consciousness and preparedness, on our unity and determination. Let
      us set to work then with greater boldness and greater unity, let us do all
      in our power for the proletarians of the different nationalities to march
      to freedom under the leadership of a really united Russian
      Social-Democratic Labour Party.

We have received the following leaflets of the Central Committee of the Russian
Liberation Union (R.L.U.), printed and distributed in Russia:

(1) an unaddressed
appeal setting forth the aims and the nature of the R.L.U.;

(2) an appeal to the
workers concerning the establishment of the R.L.U. Workers’ Union, and

(3) the Rules of this Workers’ Union. From these documents it is
evident that “the R.L.U. is not a party with a definite and
specific programme, but rather an association of all who desire the
transfer of power from the autocracy to the people by means of the
armed uprising and through the convocation of a Constituent
Assembly” based on universal suffrage with all its democratic
aspects. “The urgent necessity,” we read in the first appeal,
“of achieving the universal immediate objective, i.e., a
Constituent Assembly, has given rise to the R.L.U., which has made it
its aim to unite all who strive for the political freedom of Russia
and to take practical steps to achieve the revolution. With the
achievement of this objective the R.L.U. will discontinue its
activities and entrust the protection of the people’s representatives
and of public safety to a civil militia to be organised for the
purpose.”


The Rules of the Workers’ Union consist of 43 clauses, and their aim is set
forth as follows:

“(1) to organise combat groups for the armed uprising;

(2) to raise the necessary funds for arms and for literature of a strictly
proletarian nature.” The organisation of the Workers’ Union consists
of four-stage bodies:

(1) groups of workers (mainly from one and the
same workshop);

(2)
factory councils;

(3) district meetings; and

(4) committees of the Workers’
Union. All higher bodies consist of elected representatives of the lower
bodies, with

    

two exceptions: first, each committee of the Workers’ Union contains a member of
      the C.C. of the Russian Liberation Union; second, it is not specified
      whether this C.C. is elected or whether it is subject to any control. All
      that is said on the relations between the Workers’ Union and the
      R.L.U. is: “Through us (the C.C. of the R.L.U.) the Workers’ Union
      will be connected with all the other workers’ and non-working-class
      associations.” Not a word is mentioned about the organisation of the
      R.L.U. itself and the relation of its C.C. to the R.L.U. as a whole. In
      its appeal to the workers the C.C. of the R.L.U. sets forth its immediate
      task as follows:

“We shall work out a detailed plan of the uprising, tell you how to form
combat squads, teach you how to arm, and supply fire-arms. Lastly, we shall
unite the activities of all people scattered in all towns and places, who want
to free Russia from the yoke of the autocracy, and, when that unity has been
achieved, we will give the signal for the general uprising.” Finally, we would
point out that the Rules of the Workers’ Union (§4) say: “The appeal
to form the Workers’ Union will be distributed at all the factories of
St. Petersburg and its environs.”


From all this it is apparent that we have to do here with an attempt at an
“independent” non-party organisation of the armed popular uprising
in general and the uprising of the St. Petersburg workers in particular. We
shall not dwell here on the question to what extent this attempt is serious;
that can be judged conclusively only from its results and tentatively from
private and secret information about the R.L.U., but we have no such
information. We wish to touch therefore on the significance of this attempt in
terms of principle and the tactical and organisational tasks which it poses for
Social-Democracy.


Without doubt, we are dealing here with weighty evidence pointing to the fact
that the question of the armed popular uprising is now looming large. It is a
question which practical workers as well as theoreticians have now raised. It is
posed, not as a conclusion drawn from a definite programme (as it was, for
instance, in Social-Democratic literature abroad in

1902),[1]

but as a vital issue

    

of the practical movement today. It is not a question now of discussing the
problem, or even of preparing for the uprising in general, but of actually
carrying out the uprising. Manifestly, the whole course of events brings to
the fore the question of the uprising; the whole struggle for freedom has
made necessary such a decisive outcome. From this it is clear, by the way, how
deeply mistaken those Social-Democrats are who seek to prevent the Party from
putting this task on the order of the day.


Furthermore, the attempt we have considered proves that the
revolutionary-democratic movement in Russia has made a great stride
forward. A long time back, in issue No. 7 of

  Vperyod,[2]

 we pointed out
the emergence of this new group among the forces, parties, and organisations
hostile to the autocracy. We pointed out that the very nature of the revolution
taking place in Russia, namely, the bourgeois-democratic revolution, inevitably
increased and multiplied, and would continue to increase and multiply, the most
diverse militant elements who expressed the interests of the most diverse
sections of the people, who were prepared for decisive struggle and were
passionately devoted to the cause of freedom and prepared to sacrifice their
all for that cause, but who did not and could not grasp either the historic
significance or the class content of the revolution that was taking place. The
rapid growth of these social elements is highly characteristic of an epoch in
which the whole people is oppressed by the autocracy and in which the direct
political struggle has not yet succeeded in clearly demarcating the classes and
creating clearly defined parties understandable to the broad masses. All these
undissociated and undefined elements form the cadres of the revolutionary
democrats. Their militant significance for the democratic revolution is very
great. Their non-party, indefinite position is, on the one hand, symptomatic of
the fact that the intermediate sections of the population are rising to
desperate struggle and revolt—the sections that have least of all merged
with either of the two hostile classes in capitalist society, the sections of
the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, etc. On the other hand, the fact that
these non-party revolutionaries

    

have set out upon the revolutionary path is a pledge that the utterly backward
      sections of the people, those farthest re moved from class definiteness,
      will now be more easily, quickly, and broadly aroused and drawn into the
      struggle. Formerly only the intelligentsia in Russia was
      revolutionary. Later the urban proletariat turned revolutionary. Today a
      considerable number of other social elements, deeply rooted in the
      people” and closely linked with the masses, are turning
      revolutionary against the autocracy. The active participation of these
      elements is essential to the cause of the popular uprising. Their
    militant significance, we repeat, is very great. But their political
    significance for the proletarian movement may sometimes be small,
    if not actually negative. These elements are simply revolutionary
      and simply democratic because association with the one definite
      class which has cut
    loose from the ruling bourgeoisie, viz., the proletariat, is alien to
    them. By fighting for freedom with out close connection with the proletarian
    struggle for socialism, they play a role that objectively amounts to
    promoting the interests of the bourgeoisie. They who serve the cause of
    freedom in general without serving the specific cause of proletarian
    utilisation of this freedom, the cause of turning the freedom to account in
    the proletarian struggle for socialism, are, in the final analysis, plainly
    and simply, fighters for the interests of the bourgeoisie. We do not in the
    least belittle the heroism of these people. We certainly do not belittle
    their tremendous role in the struggle for freedom. But we do not cease to
    maintain with the utmost emphasis that their activity does not yet in the
    least guarantee that the fruits of victory, the fruits of freedom, will be
    utilised in the interest of the proletariat, of socialism. They who stand
    outside the parties thereby serve the interests of the ruling party, albeit
    unwittingly and against their will. They who struggle for freedom outside
    the parties thereby serve the interests of the force that will inevitably
    rule when freedom is won, viz., the interests of the bourgeoisie. For this
    reason we called the non-party organisation of the uprising
    “independent” in inverted commas. Actually, non-partyism, with
    its appearance of independence, implies utter lack of independence and utter
    dependence on the ruling party. Actually, the just plain revolutionaries,
    the just

    

plain democrats are no more than the vanguard of the bourgeois-democratic
movement, and sometimes merely its auxiliary force, even its cannon-fodder.


We pass now from these general theses to a more detailed examination of the
documents in hand. “Let us abandon for a time party disputes and
differences on points of principle,” exclaims the C.C. of the R.L.U. in its
first call, “let us rally into a mighty whole, into the Russian
Liberation Union, and give our strength, our funds, and our knowledge
to the people
in its great struggle with the common enemy, the autocracy. Until the
Constituent Assembly is held, we must all go along together. Only the
Constituent Assembly can bring political freedom, without which a proper
struggle of the parties is inconceivable.” Any worker who is at all
class-conscious knows full well that the people struggling against the autocracy
consists of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie is very keen on
freedom, it is making a great stir about it, writing in the press and addressing
meetings against the autocracy. Yet is there a person so naive who does not
understand that the bourgeoisie will never give up private ownership of the land
and of capital, but, on the contrary, will fight to the last ditch to retain it
against the encroachment of the workers? For the worker to abandon differences
on questions of principle with the bourgeoisie, alongside which he is fighting
the autocracy, is tantamount to abandoning socialism, to abandoning the
idea of socialism, and the preparatory work for socialism. For the worker, in
short, it means abandoning the idea of his economic emancipation, the
emancipation of the working people from poverty and oppression. All over the
world the bourgeoisie struggled for freedom, which it won largely with the hands
of the workers, only thereafter to launch a furious struggle against
socialism. Therefore, the appeal to sink differences is a bourgeois
appeal. Under the guise of

non partyism 

the C.C. of the R.L.U. is feeding the
workers with bourgeois phrases, instilling into them bourgeois ideas,
demoralising their socialist consciousness with bourgeois exhalations. Only the
enemies of socialism, the liberal bourgeois, the Osvobozhdeniye
gentry, can be consciously in sympathy with the idea of the workers and the
bourgeois sinking their differences for a time, and only revolutionary democrats

    

 like the Socialists-Revolutionaries, who care little about socialism, can
      unconsciously be in sympathy with it The workers should fight for freedom,
      without even for a minute abandoning the idea of socialism,
    without ceasing to work for its realisation, to prepare the forces and the
    organisation for the achievement of socialism.


The C.C. of the R.L.U. says: “As far as our attitude to wards the existing
parties and organisations is concerned, we, the Central Committee of the R.L.U.,
declare that we foresee no possibility of the appearance of fundamental
differences with the Social-Democratic parties, since the principle of the
Union does not contradict their programmes” ....

These words show the extent to which the C.C. of the R.L.U. misunderstands
socialism. The C.C. does not even foresee the possibility of the appearance of
differences with Social-Democracy, whereas we have shown that a fundamental
difference exists! The C.C. sees no contradiction between the principle of the
Union and the programme of Social-Democracy, whereas we have shown that this
contradiction is as profound as the contradiction between the proletariat and
the bourgeoisie. Our radical disagreement with the R.L.U. arises precisely from
the fact that it passes socialism over in silence. Any political trend that
passes socialism over in silence is radically opposed to the
Social-Democratic programme.


The quoted passage shows that the R.L.U. is in sympathy with
Social-Democracy. Knowing nothing about the R.L.U. beyond the leaflet it has
issued, we are not yet in a position to judge the sincerity of that sympathy. At
any rate, mere Platonic sympathy cannot satisfy us, mere Platonic love is not
enough. We want more than sympathy, we want to be understood and we want our
programme to be shared by those who would not like their ideas to contradict
this programme. The Russian Liberation Union speaks of its task of “widely
distributing among the workers literature advocating a strictly
proletarian ideology” (our italics). These are very good words, but
words are not enough. And if these fine words contradict the deeds, no amount of
sincerity will save their authors in actual deeds from becoming carriers of
bourgeois ideas into the working class. Let us consider the matter: what does
this “strictly proletarian ideology” actually mean? Who is going to
judge whether it

    

is strictly proletarian? Can the problem conceivably be solved by
“abandoning for a time party disputes and differences on points of
principle”? Would it not then first be necessary to “abandon for a
time” the distribution of literature among the workers?


The C.C. of the R.L.U. once more launches the slogan of the “independent
activity” of the workers. Our Party has often witnessed attempts to call
into life a special trend in Social-Democracy under the banner of this notorious
slogan. Thus it was with the “Economists” in the past, thus it is
now with the Mensheviks or the new-Iskrists. Ever and always it turned out that
this slogan (whether those who released it were conscious of it or not) only
suited the purpose of elements who least appreciated the consistency
of principle and the idea-content of the movement. We need only see
the new use to which
this old slogan has been put: we see before our eyes a fusion of the appeal to
“independent activity” in assessing a “strictly proletarian
ideology” with the “independently active” repetition of
anti-proletarian, bourgeois phrases, with the advocacy of the bourgeois idea of
non-partyism. We would answer the C.C. of the R.L.U.:

there is only one strictly proletarian ideology, and that is Marxism. A
strictly proletarian programme and strictly proletarian tactics are the
programme and the tactics of international revolutionary Social-Democracy. This
is borne out, among other things, by proletarian experience, by the experience
of the proletarian movement throughout the world, from Germany to America, from
England to Italy. It is over half a century since this movement first emerged
upon the broad political scene in 1848; the parties of the proletariat formed
and grew into vast armies; they experienced a number of revolutions, underwent
all kinds of trials, passed through deviations to both the Right and the Left,
and waged a struggle with opportunism and with anarchism. This entire gigantic
experience serves to confirm the Marxist ideology and the Social-Democratic
programme. It is a pledge that even those workers who are now following
the lead of the R.L.U. will, in the mass, inevitably and unavoidably come to

Social-DemOcracy! 


To quote further from the Appeal: “Being largely a practical
organisation, the R.L.U. is at one in its activity

    

also with the Party of the Socialists-Revolutionaries, inasmuch as we are
      united with it by a common method—armed struggle against the
      autocracy, and a common aim—the con vocation of a Constituent
      Assembly on democratic lines....”

After what has been said we are not surprised, of course, at this rapprochement
of the revolutionary democrats with the Socialists-Revolutionaries. While
stressing the practical nature of its organisation in the cited passage of the
Appeal and limiting its solidarity with the Socialists-Revolutionaries
(“inasmuch as”) to common grounds of method and immediate aim, the
R.L.U. obviously abstains for the present from determining the relationship
between the “principles” of the Socialists-Revolutionaries and those
of a “strictly proletarian ideology”. Such an abstention would be a
very bad recommendation for a Social-Democrat, but a very good one for a
revolutionary democrat. Unfortunately, however, the ensuing sentence in the
Appeal shows what a non-party” stand may lead to.... “We have
nothing against even the Osvobozhdeniye League,” says the C.C. of the
R.L.U., “notwithstanding the radical difference in our political
convictions, provided, of course, that it brings itself to realise the
inevitability of the armed uprising if a Constituent Assembly is to be
convened.”


In the first place, we would remark in this connection that if the
R.L.U. differs radically only with the political views of the
Osvobozhdeniye League, we can infer that it does not differ with its
economic programme, in which case it explicitly renounces socialism and fully
subscribes to the views of the revolutionary bourgeois democrats! This
deduction, of course, is at variance with the R.L.U.’s sympathies for a
“strictly proletarian ideology”, but the essence of a
“non-party” stand consists precisely in the fact that it engenders
endless and hopeless contradictions.


Secondly, what exactly is the radical difference between the political views of
the R.L.U. and the Osvobozhdeniye League? The R.L.U. has just rapped
its own knuckles; it has spoken of “going along together to a Constituent
Assembly” and “abandoning for a time party disputes and differences
on points of principle"(obviously, until the Constituent Assembly is convened),
and now, before the Constituent Assembly, it precipitates a dispute and
expresses its disagreement

    

 with the Osvobozhdeniye League, which adopted in its
programme the convocation of a popular Constituent Assembly on democratic lines!
How does it happen that the R.L.U., while expressing a desire to
“propagandise its political convictions”, manages to say nothing on
the content of those convictions? Is the R.L.U. a republican organisation, as
distinct from the Osvobozhdeniye League, which is monarchist? Do the
political convictions of the R.L.U. include, say, the abolition of the standing
army and its replacement by the arming of the people? the demand for the
complete disestablishment of the Church? the complete abolition of indirect
taxes, etc.? In its desire to simplify and ease things by abandoning party
disputes and fundamental differences, the R.L.U. has actually complicated and
made things more difficult by the utter vagueness of its position.


Thirdly, how are we to know whether the Osvobozhdeniye League will
fulfil the condition which the R.L.U. has set it, whether it will “bring
itself to realise the inevitability of the armed uprising”? Are we to wait for
its official announcement on that score? But the Osvobozhdeniye League
refuses to say anything about the methods by which its programme is to be
carried out. It gives its members full scope both in the choice of those methods
and in the matter of modifying the programme itself. It considers itself to be
a part of the “Constitutional-Democratic” (read
constitutional-monarchist) party, whose other part forms the Zemstvo
grouping which
refuses to commit itself to any programme or to any tactics whatever. This being
the case, what does the condition set to the Osvobozhdeniye League by
the R.L.U. amount to? Further, who does not know that the
Osvobozhdeniye adherents do not commit themselves to any definite
programme or tactical line, in order to be completely free in certain cases to
declare themselves (especially unofficially) both for terrorism and for the up
rising? Hence, we arrive at the indubitable conclusion that influential members
and even influential groups of the League will experience no difficulty in
joining, should they wish to do so, the R.L.U. and in occupying key positions
therein. Given the R.L.U.’s non-party position, quite a number of circumstances
beyond its control (large financial resources, social connections, etc.) will
favour such an

    

outcome. This outcome would mean the conversion of the armed fighting squads of
      the people into an instrument of the liberal bourgeoisie, the subjection
      of the workers’ up rising to its interests. It would mean the political
      exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie in the
      Russian democratic revolution. In the event of such an outcome
      the bourgeoisie would
      furnish the money to arm the proletariat, taking care to divert the
      proletariat from socialism by preaching common-party interests, to weaken
      its ties with Social-Democracy, and thus to render its own chances most
      favour able for using the workers as its tool and for depriving them of
      the possibilities to advance their own, “party”, proletarian
      interests in the revolution.

 *     *  * 

The tactical tasks, which the appearance of this new union sets before the
Social-Democrats, follow naturally from what has been said above. Whether this
particular union, the R.L.U., especially its C.C., subject to no
control and answerable to no one, merits confidence, we cannot say. We
shall not dwell on the
C.C. of the R.L.U., but on the R.L.U. Workers’ Union, and not so much on this
particular workers’ union as on workers’ unions of this type in general. Similar
unions”, organisations, groups, and circles in varying forms, under
varying names, and of varying sizes, are today springing up all over Russia. The
whole policy of the autocracy, which compels the people to resort to arms and
prepare for the uprising, inevitably stimulates the organisation of such
groups. The motley, often accidental, nature of their social composition, with
its indeterminate class character, in con junction with an extremely limited
scope of effective Social-Democratic work, inevitably lends these groups the
character of common-party revolutionary-democratic groups. The practical
attitude of the Social-Democrats towards them is one of our Party’s most
pressing problems.


We must, in the first place, decidedly use all means to make the
Social-Democratic standpoint clear to the members of these groups, especially to
the workers, without vagueness or reservation in the slightest, that the
proletariat must organise definitely on a party basis and definitely in the

Social-Democratic Party, if it does not wish to be politically exploited by the
bourgeoisie. It would he sheer pedantry for us simply to dismiss these groups,
or to “over look” their formation and their tremendous importance
for the struggle for freedom. It would be unpardonable doctrinairism for the
Social-Democrats to adopt a snobbish or contemptuous attitude towards the
“common-party” workers belonging to such groups. We should like in
particular to warn all members of the Party against such mistakes, which are
possible as a result of the revival of Economism of rueful memory and a narrow,
tail-ist interpretation of our tasks in the ranks of Social-Democracy. Every
effort should be made to effect a mutual exchange of assistance between these
groups and the organisations of our Party for the purpose of arming the
greatest possible number of workers. There should be an extremely discreet,
tactful, and comradely attitude towards the workers, who are ready to die for
freedom, who are organising and arming for the fight, who are in complete
sympathy with the proletarian struggle, and who are yet divided from us by the
lack of a Social-Democratic world outlook, by anti-Marxist prejudices, and by
survivals of superannuated revolutionary views. Nothing is easier than the
method of immediately breaking with such otherwise-minded workers or of simply
keeping aloof from them; nor is there anything more stupid than such a
method. We should remember that Social-Democracy’s strength lies in the unity of
the broad masses of the proletariat, and that such unity, owing to the
splitting, disuniting, and dulling conditions of capitalism, is not achieved
with immediacy, but only at the cost of persistent effort and tremendous
patience. We should remember the experiences of our European comrades, who
consider it their duty to show an attitude of comradely concern even towards the
workers who are members of the Catholic unions and try not to antagonise them
by treating their religious and political prejudices with contempt, but
persistently, tactfully, and patiently make use of every act of the political
and economic struggle in order to enlighten them and bring them closer to the
class conscious proletariat on the ground of common struggle. How much more
careful should our attitude be towards the worker-revolutionaries, who are
prepared to fight for freedom

    

but are still strangers to Social-Democracy! We repeat:
no concealment of Social-Democratic views, but no slighting of the revolutionary
groups that do not share these views. So long as these groups have not
officially joined any non Social-Democratic party, we are entitled, nay,
obligated to regard them as associated with the R.S.D.L.P. Thus, too,
we should regard the Workers’ Union of the Russian Liberation Union. We should
make every effort to introduce the members of this union to socialist literature
and conduct propaganda of our views by word of mouth at all meetings of all the
branches of this union. Even in the free countries of Europe the idea that all
proletarians can be made class-conscious Social-Democrats under capitalism is
considered utopian. But neither in Europe nor in Russia is the idea of the
Social-Democrats’ leading influence upon the mass of the proletariat considered
utopian. The thing is to learn how to exercise this influence, to remember that
our best ally in educating the unenlightened workers will be our enemies, the
government and the bourgeoisie; then we shall be sure that, at the decisive
moment, the whole working-class mass will respond to the call of
Social-Democracy!

The

[Russian] Social
Democratic Party,

as the conscious exponent of the working-class
movement, aims at the complete liberation of the toiling masses from every form
of oppression and exploitation. The achievement of this objective—the
abolition of

private
      property

 in the

means
      of production

 and the creation of the

socialist
      society—calls

for a very high development of the

productive
      forces

 of capitalism and a high degree of organisation of the working class. The
full development of the productive forces in modern

bourgeois 

society, a broad,
free, and open class struggle, and the political education, training, and
rallying of the masses of the proletariat are inconceivable without political

freedom.

Therefore it has always been the aim of the class-conscious
proletariat to wage a determined struggle for complete political freedom and
the democratic revolution.


The proletariat is not alone in setting this task before itself. The
bourgeoisie, too, needs political freedom. The enlightened members of the
propertied classes hung out the banner of liberty long ago; the revolutionary
intelligentsia, which comes mainly from these classes, has fought heroically
for freedom. But the bourgeoisie as a whole is incapable of waging a determined
struggle against the autocracy; it fears to lose in this struggle its property
which binds it to the existing order; it fears an

all-too 

revolutionary action
of the workers, who will not stop at the democratic revolution but will aspire
to the socialist revolution; it fears a complete break with officialdom, with
the bureaucracy, whose interests are bound up by a thousand ties with the
interests of the

propertied 

classes. For this reason

    

the bourgeois struggle for liberty is notoriously timorous, inconsistent, and
      half-hearted. One of the tasks of the proletariat is to prod the
      bourgeoisie on, to raise before the whole people slogans calling for a
      complete democratic revolution, to start working boldly and independently
      for the realisation of these slogans—in a word, to be the vanguard,
      to take the lead in the struggle for the liberty of the whole people.


In the pursuit of this aim the Russian Social-Democrats have had to fight many a
battle against the inconsistency of bourgeois liberalism. Let us recall, for
instance, how Mr. Struve began his career, unhampered by the

censor, 

as a
political champion of the “liberation” of Russia. He made his
début with his preface to the Witte
“Memorandum”, in which
he advanced the markedly “Shipovian” (to use the current political
nomenclature) slogan, “Rights, and an Authoritative Zemstvo”. The
Social-Democratic Party exposed the retrogressive, absurd, and reactionary
nature of that slogan; it demanded a definite and uncompromising democratic
platform, and itself put forward such a platform as an integral part of its
Party programme. Social-Democracy had to combat the narrow conception of the
aims of democracy which obtained in its own ranks when the so-called Economists
did their best to play down these aims, when they advocated the “economic
struggle against the employers and the, government”, and insisted that we
must start by winning rights, continue with political agitation, and only then
gradually (the theory of stages) pass on to political struggle.


Now the political struggle has become vastly extended, the revolution has spread
throughout the land, the mildest liberals have become “extremists”;
it may therefore seem that historical references to the recent past such as we
have just made are out of place, with no bearing on the actual turbulent
present. But this may seem so only at first glance. To be sure, such slogans as
the demand for a Constituent Assembly and for universal, direct, and equal
suffrage by secret ballot (which the Social-Democrats long since and in advance
of all presented in their Party programme) have become common property; they
have been adopted by the illegal Osvobozhdeniye, incorporated in the
programme of

    

the Osvobozhdeniye League, turned into Zemtsvo slogans, and are now
being repeated in every shape and form by the legal press. That Russian
bourgeois democracy has made progress in recent years and months cannot be
doubted. Bourgeois democracy is learning by experience, is discarding primitive
slogans (like the Shipovian “Rights, and an Authoritative Zemstvo”) and is
hobbling along behind the revolution. But it is only hobbling along behind; new
contradictions between its words and its deeds, between democracy in

principle 

and democracy in “Realpolitik”, are arising in place of the
old; for revolutionary developments are making steadily growing demands on
democracy. But bourgeois democracy always drags at the

tail 

of events; while
adopting more advanced slogans, it always lags behind; it always formulates the
slogans several degrees below the level really required in the real
revolutionary struggle for real liberty.


Indeed, let us take that now current and generally accepted slogan, “For
a Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage by
secret ballot”. Is that slogan adequate from the standpoint of consistent
democracy? Is it adequate in the light of the urgent revolutionary tasks of the
present moment? The answer to both these questions can be only in the
negative. To be convinced that this is so one has only to examine carefully our
Party programme, to which our organisations, unfortunately, do not often refer
and which they quote and disseminate all too little. (As a happy exception,
worthy of the

widest 

emulation, we note the recent reprint of our Party
programme in leaflet form by the Riga, Voronezh, and Moscow committees.) The
keynote of our programme, too, is the demand for a popular Constituent Assembly
(let us agree, for

brevity’s 

sake, to use the word “popular” as
denoting suffrage that is universal, etc.). But this slogan does not stand
isolated in our programme. The context and the addenda and notes prevent any
miconstruction on the part of those who are



least consistent in the struggle
for liberty or who even struggle against it. It occurs in our programme in
conjunction with the following other slogans:

(1) the overthrow of the

tsarist 

autocracy;

(2) its replacement by the democratic
republic;

(3)
the sovereignty of the people, safeguarded by a democratic
constitution, i.e., the concentration of supreme

    

governmental authority entirely in the hands of a legislative assembly
    composed of representatives of the people and forming a single chamber.


Can there be any doubt that every consistent democrat is

obligated 

to accept all
these slogans? Why, the very word “democrat”, both by its etymology
and by virtue of the political significance it has acquired throughout the
history of Europe, denotes an adherent of the sovereignty of the people. It is
absurd, therefore, to talk of democracy and in the same breath to reject even a
single one of these slogans. But the main contradiction, the contradiction
between the desire of the bourgeoisie to preserve private property at all costs
and its desire for liberty, is so profound that spokesmen or followers of the
liberal bourgeoisie inevitably find themselves in this ridiculous position. As
everyone knows, a very broad liberal party is

forming Itself in 

Russia with
enormous rapidity, a party which has the adherence of the
Osvobozhdeniye League, of the mass of the Zemstvo people, and of
newspapers like Nasha Zhizn, Nashi Dni, Syn Otechestva, Russkiye

   Vedomosti,[1]

etc., etc. This liberal-bourgeois party likes to be called the
“Constitutional-Democratic” Party. In actual fact, however, as can
be seen from the declarations and the programme of the illegal
Osvobozhdeniye, it is a monarchist party. It does not want a
republic at all. It does not want a unicameral assembly, and it proposes for
the Upper House indirect and virtually non-universal suffrage (residence
qualification). It is anything but anxious for the supreme governmental
authority to pass entirely into the hands of the people (although for
window-dressing purposes it is very fond of talking about the transfer of power
to the people). It does not want the autocracy to be overthrown. It
wants only a division of power among (1) the monarchy; (2) the Upper House
(where landowners and capitalists will predominate); and (3) the Lower House,
which alone is to be built on democratic principles.


Thus, we have before us the indisputable fact that our “democratic”
bourgeoisie, even as represented by its most advanced, most educated elements,
those least subject to

    

the direct influence of capital, is trailing behind the revolution. This
“democratic” party fears the sovereignty of the
people. While repeating our slogan of a popular Constituent Assembly, it in
fact completely distorts its

sense 

 and significance and misleads the people by
its use, or, rather, abuse.


What is a “popular Constituent” Assembly? It is an assembly which,
in the first place, really expresses the will of the people. To this end we must
have universal suffrage in all of its democratic aspects, and a full guarantee
of freedom to conduct the election campaign. It is an assembly which, in the
second place, really has the power and authority to
“inaugurate” a political order which will ensure the sovereignty of
the people. It is clear as daylight that without these two conditions the
assembly can be neither truly popular nor truly

constituent. 

Yet our liberal
bourgeois, our constitutional monarchists (whose claim to be democrats is a
mockery of the people) do not want real safeguards to ensure either of
these conditions! Not only do they fail to ensure in

any way 

complete freedom of
election propaganda or the actual transfer of power and authority to the
Constituent

Assembly, 

but, on the contrary, they seek to make both
impossible since they aim at maintaining the monarchy. The real power
and authority is to remain in the hands of

Nicholas
      the Bloody.

This means that
the dire enemy of the people is to convene the assembly and “ensure”
that the elections will be free and universal. How very democratic! It means
that the Constituent Assembly will never have and (according to the idea of the
liberal bourgeois) must never have all power and all authority; it is to be
utterly devoid of power, devoid of authority; it is merely to come to terms,
to reach an agreement, to arrive at an understanding, to strike a bargain
with Nicholas II for the assembly to be granted a modicum of his royal power!
The Constituent Assembly elected by universal suffrage is to differ in no way
from a Lower House. That is to say, the Constituent Assembly, convened for
expressing and executing the will of the people, is designed by the liberal
bourgeoisie to “constitute”, over the will of



the people,
the will of an Upper House and on top of that the will of the monarchy, the
will of Nicholas.

 

Is it not obvious that in talking, speechifying, and shouting about a popular
      Constituent Assembly, the liberal bourgeois, the Osvobozhdeniye
    gentry, are actually planning an anti-popular consultative
    assembly? Instead of emancipating the people, they want to subject the
    people, by constitutional means, first, to the power of the tsar
    (monarchism), and, secondly, to the power of the organised big bourgeoisie
    (the Upper House).


If anyone wishes to dispute this conclusion, let him assert: (1) that there can
be a true expression of the popular will in elections without complete freedom
of propaganda and without the actual abolition of all the propaganda privileges
of the tsarist government; or (2) that an assembly of delegates devoid of real
power and authority, in that these are left in the hands of the tsar, is not,
in effect, a mere consultative body. To make either of these assertions one must
be either a brazen charlatan or a

hope less 

fool. History proves conclusively
that a representative assembly coexisting with a monarchical form of
government is in actual fact, so long as governmental power remains in
the hands of
the monarchy, a

consultative 

body which does not bend the will of the monarch to
the will of the people, but only conforms the will of the people to the
will of the

monarch, i. e., 

divides the power between monarch and people,
bargains for a new order, but does not constitute it. History proves
conclusively that there can be no such thing as really free elections, that the
significance and character of these elections can hardly be brought home to the
whole people unless the government that is combating the revolution is
replaced by a provisional revolutionary government. Granting for a moment the
improbable and the impossible, namely, that the tsarist government,
having decided to convene a “Constituent” (read:
consultative) Assembly,
will give formal guarantees of freedom of propaganda, all the vast
advantages and superior facilities for campaigning which accrue from the
organised power of the state will nevertheless remain in its hands. These
advantages and facilities for propaganda during the elections to the first
people’s assembly will be enjoyed by the very ones who have oppressed the people
by all the means in their power, and from whom the people have begun
to

wrest 

liberty by force.

 

In a word, we

arrive 

at the very conclusion we reached on the previous occasion
(Proletary,

       No. 3),[2]

when we examined this question from another
angle. The slogan of a popular Constituent Assembly, taken by itself,
separately, is at the present time a slogan of the monarchist bourgeoisie, a
slogan calling for a deal between the bourgeoisie and the tsarist
government. Only the overthrow of the tsarist government and its replacement by
a provisional revolutionary government, whose duty it will be to convene the
popular Constituent Assembly, can be the slogan of the revolutionary
struggle.

Let 

the proletariat of Russia have no illusions on this score; in the
din of the general excitation it is being deceived by the use of its own
slogans. If we

fail 

to match the armed force of the government with the force of
an armed people, if the tsarist government is not utterly defeated and replaced
by a provisional revolutionary government, every representative assembly,
whatever title—“popular”, “constituent”, etc.—may
be conferred upon it, will in fact be an assembly of representatives of the big
bourgeoisie convened for the purpose of bargaining with the tsar for a division
of power.


The more the people’s struggle against the tsar comes to a head and the greater
likelihood there is of a speedy realisation of the demand for an assembly of
people’s representatives, the more closely must the revolutionary proletariat
watch the “democratic” bourgeoisie. The sooner we gain freedom, the
sooner will this ally of the proletariat become its enemy. Two circumstances
will serve to cloak this change:

(1) the vagueness, incompleteness, and non-committal character of the would-be
    democratic slogans of the bourgeoisie; and

(2) the endeavour to turn the
    slogans of the proletariat into mere phrases, to substitute empty promises
    for real safeguards of liberty and revolution. The workers must now
    watch the “democrats” with intensified vigilance. The words
    “popular Constituent Assembly” will be nothing more than words
    if,

owing 

to the actual conditions under which the election campaign and the
    elections themselves are conducted, this assembly fails to express the will
    of the people, if it lacks the strength independently to establish the new
    order.

    

The cardinal issue is now shifting from the question of summoning the popular
      Constituent Assembly to the question of the method by which it
    is to be summoned. We are on the eve of decisive events. The proletariat
    must not pin its faith in general democratic slogans but must contrapose to
    them its own proletarian-democratic slogans in their full scope. Only a
    force guided by these slogans can really ensure the complete victory of the
    revolution.

Geneva, Wednesday, June 21(8)


Yesterday the telegraph brought the news that Nicholas II had received a Zemstvo
deputation last Monday. Responding to speeches by Prince Sergei Trubetskoi and
Mr. Fyodrov, the tsar emphatically confirmed his promise to convene an
assembly of people’s representatives.


To appreciate fully the significance of this “event” we
must first of all reconstruct certain facts that were reported
in the foreign press.


On May 24 and 25, old style, about 300 Zemstvo and municipal representatives
held three meetings in Moscow. In the lithographed copies we have received from
Russia of their petition to the tsar and of a resolution adopted by them the
number of attending delegates is not indicated; mention is made only of City
Mayors and Marshals of the Nobility, as well as Zemstvo and municipal
councillors, having attended the Conference. The representatives of landlordism
and urban capital discussed the political fortunes of Russia. According to the
foreign correspondents, the debate was very heated. The Shipov party, with its
moderate policy and its extensive Court connections, enjoyed great
influence. The most radical were the provincial delegates, the most moderate
those from St. Petersburg, while the “Centre” was formed by the
Moscow delegates. Every word of the petition was debated, St. Petersburg finally
joining in the vote for it. The resulting document was a patriotic and loyal
petition. “Actuated solely by ardent love of country”, the
respectable bourgeois gentlemen sink “all discord

    

and all differences that divide them” and appeal to the tsar. They point
      to “the grave danger to Russia and to the Throne itself”,
      which emanates not so much from abroad as from “internal
      strife”. (True, “Russia” comes before the
      “Throne”, but our patriots appealed to the Throne first and
      only threatened—privately and à la
      sourdine—to appeal
    to the people.) As usual, the petition is full of official eyewash:

everything is blamed on the tsar’s councillors, on the distortion of his
designs and prescriptions which has led to a tightening of the· police
regime and prevented the “voice of truth” from ascending to the
Throne, etc. They conclude with the request, “before it is too
late”, that “representatives of the people elected for this purpose
by all subjects on an equal basis, without any distinction, be convoked without
delay”. The representatives of the people are to decide the question of
war or peace “in concert” with the tsar and to establish [also
in concert with the tsar] an improved system of
government”. Thus, the petition contains no explicit demand for
universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot, which was alleged to
have been adopted by the “Constitutional-Democratic” Party (all
reference to direct suffrage and secret ballot is omitted and, of course, not by
accident); and no guarantees whatever are demanded to ensure that the elections
will be free. The authors of the petition state pathetically: “Oppression
of the individual and of society, denial of free speech, and all manner of
tyranny are multiplying and growing”; but no measures against them are
suggested. Tyranny is growing “in concert” with the tsar; so let the
political system be “improved” in concert with the tsar.... The
representatives of the bourgeoisie are holding fast to the theory of an
“agreement”, not, of course, on the part of the people, but on the
part of the bourgeoisie, and the people’s oppressors.


The Conference elected a delegation to present the petition to the tsar. It
consisted of Messrs. Heyden, Golovin, Petrunkevich, G. and N. Lvov, Pyotr and
Pavel Dolgorukov, Kovalevsky, Novosiltsev, Rodichev, Shakhovskoi, and Sergei
Trubetskoi. Later, at the audience given by Nicholas II, they were joined by
Messrs. Korf, Nikitin, and Fyodorov, from St. Petersburg.


The Conference then adopted the following resolution,

    

which was not reported in the foreign press but is reproduced in the Russian
leaflet:



“This Conference of united groups of Zemstvo and municipal
representatives, imbued, notwithstanding differences of opinion on certain
political questions, with the common conviction that the root cause of the
present difficult position of Russia, domestic and foreign, is the still
existing system of government by decree, which denies individual and public
freedom,represses the self-realisation and independent activity of the people,
debars the population from participation in the life of the state, and breeds
unrestrained and constantly increasing lawlessness on the part of an
irresponsible administration; that this system of government, which for many
years has been a source of violence, falsehood, and corruption in our internal
life, has now led to the dire threat of grave external danger, by having
involved the nation in a disastrous war, in the course of which it has
engendered and sustained internecine strife, and brought the country to a series
of defeats culminating in a disaster to its naval forces unprecedented in
Russian history;—and, firm in the conviction that the further existence
of this regime menaces, not only the internal peace, the order, and the welfare
of the people, but also the stability of the Throne and the territorial
integrity and external security of Russia, this Conference declares that the
salvation of the country makes it imperatively necessary:


“1. That freely elected popular representatives be immediately convoked to
decide, jointly with the Sovereign, the question of war and peace and of
establishing a constitutional state system;


“2. That all laws, institutions, decisions, and orders which contravene
the principles of personal liberty, freedom of speech, of the press, and of
association and assembly, be immediately nullified, and that a political amnesty
be proclaimed;


“3. That the administrative personnel be immediately renewed through the
placement of the central administration in the charge of persons who are
sincerely devoted to the cause of reforming the state and who enjoy the
confidence of the community.”



We do not know in what relation this resolution stands to the petition and to
the mandates of the delegation, whether the delegation undertook to set forth
the substance of the resolution or to present it together with the
petition. Perhaps the petition is the official document for the
“Throne”, and the resolution the unofficial document for the
“people”?


As regards the character of the debates at the Conference, the correspondent of
the French paper Le Matin,[1]

M. Gaston Leroux, reports that the most
“progressive-minded” of the delegates, those from the provincial
Zemstvos, stood for a two-stage electoral system, fearing that under

    

direct elections they would be overwhelmed by the “towns” (evidently
      they feared that under direct elections the privileges of the landlords
      over the peasants would not be fully guaranteed). The correspondent of
      the Frankfurter Zeitung wrote:


“The Russian Zemstvo as a political party consists of three groupings: the
liberal Zemstvo majority (with Count Heyden as its leader), the
moderately liberal nationalist Slavophil Zemstvo minority headed by
Mr. Shipov, and the group of radical Zemstvo constitutionalists. It is
characteristic that at the election of delegates ... it was the
’feudal’ candidates
that got through. The moderates wanted to be worthily represented before the
tsar by members of respected old families. And the radicals, who entertained no
illusions as to the outcome of the petition, wanted the representatives of the
old families to see with their own eyes that the government would not yield an
inch voluntarily.”


The conveniences of that nebulous organisation of the
“Constitutional-Democratic” (read: monarchist) party eulogised by
Mr. Struve were not long in revealing themselves in practice. A strong, firmly
knit party organisation will not lend itself to dickering and bargaining, to
dodges and subterfuges. Let the “party” include both the
Osvobozhdeniye League (perhaps this is the “group of
radicals” mentioned by the correspondent of the Frankfurter
Zeitung) and the “Zemstvo group” (i.e., the followers of Heyden
and of Shipov, from whom Mr. Struve is now officially seeking to dissociate himself). But the Zemstvo group includes the Heydenists, the
Shipovists, and ... the “radicals”. Work this out if you can! But
they are all agreed, moved as they were by ardent love for their country and for
the privileges of the bourgeois, on the theory of agreement, with which
we have often dealt in Proletary, and which is clearly in evidence both
in the “petition” and in the “resolution”.


The resolution was probably designed to satisfy the “ideal” demands
of the radicals, while the petition, as interpreted by the
“moderate” delegates, was to serve the purpose of a material deal
with tsarism. Such things as the numerical representation of the groupings at
the Conference, the powers of the delegates, the terms of the deal,

    

and the further intentions of the Zemstvo men were very

care fully 

concealed
from the uninitiated plebs. The “people”, in whose name the
bourgeois gentlemen are bargaining with tsarism, have no need to know the high
politics of the “Constitutional-Democratic Party”! The
bourgeois gentlemen will converse with the tsar about the suppression of free
speech and the voice of truth, about people’s representatives, about a
Russia that has “rallied round the one standard of the
people”, etc.; but for this people to know the whole truth about
the policy pursued by the liberal and Osvobozhdeniye hagglers is quite
superfluous.... Indeed,not without reason did Mr. Struve, in 0svobozhdeniye , recently reproach the “extreme parties” (the
Social-Democrats in particular) for their immoderate leaning to narrow,
conspiratorial, Jacobin “secrecy”. We Social-Democrats resort to
secrecy from the tsar and his blood hounds, while taking pains that the people
should know every thing about our Party, about the shades of opinion within it,
about the development of its programme and policy, that they should even know
what this or that Party congress delegate said at the congress in question. The
enlightened bourgeois of the Osvobozhdeniye fraternity
surround themselves with secrecy... from the people, who know nothing
definite about the
much-talked-of “Constitutional-Democratic” Party; but they make up
for this by taking the tsar and his sleuths into their confidence. Who can say
they are not democrats?


What secrets the Zemstvo delegates unbosomed to the Court cabal, who refused to
admit them to the tsar, we do not know. But the confidences and talks continued
for quite a while. The foreign press was agog for news about the delegates’
every step in the game of “high politics”. St. Petersburg, June 9
(May 27): The Zemstvo deputation will in the first place see Mr. Bulygin,
Minister of the Interior, in order to lodge a complaint against Trepov. June 10
(May 28):

Bulygin told the deputation that it would not be received by the tsar and
advised it to leave St. Petersburg. June 12 (May 30): It is thought probable
that the tsar will receive the deputation. June 15 (2): A special telegram from
M. Gaston Leroux to Le Matin: “The Zemstvo delegates have accepted
the conditions set by the Minister of the Court for an audience with the
Emperor. Thereupon Baron Fredericks

    

 went this evening to Tsarskoye Selo to inquire of the tsar whether he had
      decided to receive the deputation.”


Do you hear this, Russian workers and peasants? This is how they behave, these
“liberationists” and “democrats”, these foes of
conspiracy, these abhorrers of secrecy! They

con spire 

with the Minister of the
Court of His Policemanic Majesty, hugger-mugger with the spies against the
people. They pose as the representatives of the “people”,
while accepting conditions framed by spies on how to speak
with a tsar on the
needs of the “people”!


This is how they act, the rich, independent, enlightened, and liberal-minded
patriots who are “actuated by ardent love of country”. How unlike
the rough unschooled working-class rabble, dependent on every clerk, which
tries to push its way straight to the tsar without any concealment, led by an
audacious priest, without having even talked with the influential spies about
the conditions of an interview with the tsar. How can one think of a republic,
or even of direct elections or of a unicameral system with such politically
uneducated masses? The politically educated know the ropes and understand that
one should first make a backstairs call on the spies—perhaps even consult
them as to the substance and style of the petition to the tsar—after
which the “voice of truth” will surely “ascend to the
Throne”.


What sort of bargain the “representatives [save the mark!] of the
people” struck with the tsar’s spies we do not know. We know from the
telegrams that at the reception of the delegation Prince Trubetskoi delivered
“a lengthy speech” in which, for half an hour, he described to the
tsar the plight of Russia and the conditions that had compelled the Zemstvo men
to appeal directly to the tsar (and not through his spies?). The speech made a
profound impression upon the tsar. Mr. Fyodorov spoke on behalf of the
representatives of St. Petersburg. The tsar responded with a long
speech. He
expressed regret at the enormous sacrifices caused by the war, lamented the
latest defeat at sea, and concluded with the words: “I thank you,
gentlemen, for the sentiments you have expressed [fine sentiments they
must have been, considering that the “democrat” Trubetskoi had
consulted the spies on how to express them!]. I believe in your desire to work
with me [the tsar believes

    

the liberal bourgeoisie; the liberal bourgeoisie believes the tsar; claw
me—claw thee] in setting up a new system of government built on new
principles. My desire to convene a popular assembly [When? Are the
representatives to be elected? If so, in what manner and by whom? This is not
known. Evidently Mr. Trubetskoi concealed from his beloved sovereign the
“resolution” of the conference; the spies must have advised him not
to broach this subject to the tsar!] is unshakable. It is daily in my
thoughts. My will shall be carried out. You may announce this to the population
of town and countryside this very day. You will help me in this new work. The
popular assembly will restore unity between Russia and its emperor [between the
Trubetskois and Fyodorovs and the emperor?]. It will lay the foundation of the
system which will repose on Russian national principles." The
delegates—says the official telegram—came away from the audience
tremendously impressed. The tsar seemed pleased, too....


This does look like the real truth! The tsar is pleased, the liberal bourgeois
are pleased. They are ready to conclude a lasting peace with one another. The
autocracy and the police (the true Russian national principles) are pleased. The
money-bags as well are pleased (from now on their advice will be sought
constantly and regularly).


But will the workers and peasants be pleased—they whose interests the
bourgeois traitors are bartering away?

Friday, June 23 (10)


The press abroad has begun to comment on the audience granted to the Zemstvo
deputation by the tsar. As usual, the bourgeois press fawns, waxing sentimental
over the tsar’s amenability and the reasonableness of the Zemstvo
representatives, though certain doubts creep in as to the value of promises
given in so vague a form. The socialist papers bluntly and definitely declare
that the audience was a farce.


The autocracy is playing for time and leading the liberal bourgeoisie by the
nose. On the one hand, dictatorial powers for Trepov; on the other, meaningless
and worthless promises to the liberals in order to cause further vacillation in
their all-too vacillating ranks. The tactics of the autocratic government are
not so stupid. The liberals are playing at loyalty, moderation, and modesty. Why
should not the government take advantage of their stupidity and cowardice?
“A La guerre comme à la guerre.” There are no wars without
military stratagems. And when the “enemy” (the liberal bourgeoisie)
is something between a foe and a gullible friend, why not lead him by the nose?


M. Gaston Leroux, referred to in our leading article, reports the following
details concerning the audience, details which, though not very authentic, are
at any rate characteristic and significant. “Baron Fredericks, Minister
of the Court, told the delegates that, with the best of intentions, it was
difficult for him to obtain an imperial audience for Mr. Petrunkevich, who was
said to have revolutionary connections. It was pointed out to the Minister that
the Austrian Emperor had had among his Ministers M. Andrássy,

    

who had at one time been sentenced. This argument removed the last difficulty
and the delegates ... were conducted to the Court.”


The argument is a good one. The West-European bourgeoisie did fight in earnest
at first; at times it was even republican,its leaders were
“sentenced”—sentenced for treason, i.e., not only for
revolutionary connections, but for actual revolutionary deeds. Then,
many years, sometimes decades, later these bourgeois accommodated themselves to
the most wretched of skimpy constitutions without a republic and without even
universal suffrage or real political freedom. The liberal bourgeois became fully
reconciled to “the Throne” and the police; they rose to power
themselves and brutally suppressed, as they do to this day, every aspiration of
the workers towards freedom and social reforms.


Russia’s liberal bourgeoisie wants to combine pleasure with profit. To be
regarded as a man with “revolutionary connections” is pleasant;
to be capable of occupying a ministerial seat under the Emperor Nicholas the
Bloody is profitable. The bourgeois liberals of Russia have no desire whatever to
risk “being sentenced” for treason. They prefer the direct
leap into the stage in which ex-revolutionaries like Andrássy became
Ministers on the side of law and order. In 1848 Count Andrássy
had taken such an
energetic part in the revolutionary movement that, after the suppression of the
revolution, he was sentenced to death and hanged in effigy. He lived as
an émigré in France and in England, and he did not
return to Hungary until after
the amnesty of 1857. That is when his “ministerial” career
began. The Russian liberals do not want a revolution; they dread it; they want
to be accepted as ex-revolutionaries straight away, without ever
having been revolutionaries! They want to leap from 1847 into 1857 at a single
bound! They want to make a deal with the tsar straight away for a constitution
like those operating in Europe during the violent reaction which followed the
defeat of the Revolution of 1848.


Indeed, the example of Andrássy was an ideal choice. As the sun is reflected in
a tiny drop of water, so the parallel between the bourgeois democracy of
Europe, once revolutionary and republican, and the monarchist constitutionalist
(even

    

after January 9, 1905) bourgeois “democracy” of Russia is reflected
      in the comparison between Andráissy and Petrunkevich. First the European
      bourgeois fought on the barricades for the republic, then they lived in
      exile, and they ended up by turning traitors to the cause of liberty,
      betraying the revolution, and taking service with the constitutional
      monarchs. The Russian bourgeois want to “learn from history”
      and “reduce the stages of development”: they want to betray
      the revolution straight away, to turn traitor to liberty straight away. In
      private conversation they repeat the words of Christ to Judas: “That
      thou doest, do quickly.”


“They were ushered into another hall, ... where the tsar was to receive
them,” continues M. Gaston Leroux, “when it was suddenly discovered that
the revolutionary Petrunkevich had no kid gloves. Colonel of the Life Guards
Putyatin instantly took off his own and hastily handed them to the
revolutionary.”


The audience began. Prince Trubetskoi delivered his speech. As reported by
M. Gaston Leroux, he began by stating how grateful they were to the tsar for
having “deigned to receive us, thereby proving your confidence in
us.... We are simply people of peace and order,” declared Prince Trubetskoi (on
behalf of the whole “Constitutional-Democratic”, or
Osvobozhdeniye, Party), adding that “the tsar had been
deceived” by his councillors. The most “daring” passage in his
speech was the one in which he declared that an assembly of representatives
based on social-estates, as proposed by Bulygin, was
“inadmissible” ... why, you think? ...
because “You, Your Majesty, are not the Tsar of the nobles, of the
merchants and the peasants; you are the Tsar of All the Russias, and the
representation must be of the entire people without exception”. As to the
resolution of the Zemstvo Conference, which we publish in our leading

       article,[1]

of that not a whisper, as was only to be expected.


Mr. Fyodorov dealt in his speech with the financial side
of the “revolution in kid gloves”. The national budget would
increase after the war by an amount ranging from three hundred to four hundred
millions; “an enormous exertion for progress and civilisation” will
be necessary, and this

    

requires the “independence of society” and the “call to life
of all men of talent among the people” (chosen under the control of
Trepov?).


The tsar’s answer we know. “His speech over,” telegraphs
M. Gaston Leroux, “the tsar conversed amiably with each member of the
deputation. He went so far as to ask the famous revolutionary [Petrunkevich] if
he was a Marshal of the Nobility. The latter replying in the negative, the tsar
expressed the hope that the day would come when he would attain that rank and
passed on to another delegate. When he had taken leave of the company, the
delegates were ushered into a back room in the palace, where they were served a
lunch, which, they estimated, might cost 75 kopeks. In any case, the delegates
were pleased with the outcome. Elf not at once a ministerial portfolio, at least
the post of Marshal of the Nobility had been promised! Even Andráissy must have
started as a Marshal of the Nobility, or some thing of the sort! I They had
begun dispatching innumerable telegrams [to the effect that confidence between
the’ tsar and the “people” had now been restored? I ... when they
received the official text of the tsar’s reply. Great was their stupefaction
when they failed to find in it the only important sentence that seemed to
promise at least something. The words: ’Our imperial will to convene
representatives of the people is unshakable’ was changed to the simple
affirmation:
’Our imperial will is unshakable’. The delegates immediately returned this
official text as unacceptable. Today, not without impatience, they looked
forward to receiving a text that would contain the words they all had heard. One
of the deputies told me tonight [the telegram of M. Leroux is dated June 20 (7)]
with reference to this fantastic manipulation of sentences: This is no longer
an autocracy, it’s hocus-pocus."


Well put, or well invented, if M. Leroux invented it all. There is hocus-pocus
in it even if the promise to convene the popular representatives had been
included in the official text of the speech. Kid gloves, and a flunkey’s at
that, are the true emblem of the political act performed by the Petrunkeviches
and the Rodichevs. They started with hocus-pocus themselves, not only by
accepting the terms of the audience, but by hiding their resolution in their
pockets, by concealing

    

their real wishes, and by most improperly misrepresenting the tsar as a victim
      of deception, etc., etc. They have no right to complain now that their
      trickery was answered with trickery. For a general promise to convene
      representatives of the people means absolutely nothing and yields
      absolutely nothing while leaving a clear field for a Bulygin and
      Trepov. “constitution”, and ample opportunity for
      procrastination of every description. Everything remains as it
      was, except
      that the liberals, fooled like schoolboys, and disgraced by the promise
      of a Marshal’s rank, have done a service to the autocracy by dispatching
      telegrams hailing the return of “confidence” and making
      reports about the audience like Mr. Nikitin’s in the St. Petersburg
      municipal council.


We should not like to assume the role of Cassandra.[2]

We should not
like to prophesy a ludicrous and ignoble end for the Russian revolution. But it
is our duty to tell the workers bluntly and openly, to tell the whole people
that things are heading that way. The Constitutional would-be Democratic Party
and all these gentlemen of Osvobozhdeniye are bringing matters to such
an end and to no other. Do not be deceived by the claptrap of the
radical-Osvobozhdeniye speeches and the Zemstvo resolutions. This is
the gaudily painted stage set for the “people”, while a brisk trade
is going on behind the scenes. The liberal bourgeoisie knows how to cast parts:
the radical spellbinders are sent to speechify at banquets and meetings, while
the hard-boiled businessmen are sent to “prepare the ground” among
the Court clique. And since the power remains perfectly intact and unlimited in
the hands of the autocracy, the inevitable result of such a course of
development will be a “constitution” a hundred times more like the
Bulygin scheme than that of Osvobozhdeniye.


The destiny of the Russian revolution now rests with the proletariat. Only the
proletariat can put a stop to this haggling. Only the proletariat can, by a new
heroic effort, rouse the masses, split the wavering army, win over the
peasantry, and, arms in hand, gain freedom for the whole people by
ruthlessly
crushing the enemies of liberty and hurling aside its self-seeking and wavering
bourgeois bell-ringers.

Dear Comrades,


In issue No. 135 of the Leipziger Volkszeitung Comrade Karl Kautsky
writes on the split in the Russian Social-Democracy. We feel compelled to ask
that you publish our reply to Kautsky’s attacks and to allow us to refute the
factual inaccuracies which his article contains. We shall be brief.


Kautsky says that “the German edition of the resolutions adopted at the
recent Russian Congress could not have appeared at a more inopportune
moment”, that the resolutions “will give most readers a totally
false picture of the relations that exist in the Russian
Social-Democracy”. Kautsky goes so far as to propose to the German comrades
that they should not make these resolutions public.


We take the liberty of pointing out that nothing could give our German comrades
a better idea of the relations within the Russian Social-Democracy than the
original resolutions of the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party, as well as the resolutions of the “conference” held
by the new-Iskrists.


We declare that Kautsky is making a great mistake in writing on matters of
which, at best, he knows only by hear say, and that his picture of the relations
that exist in the Russian Social-Democracy is a highly distorted one. It is
utterly ridiculous, for instance, to hear Kautsky suggest that “the
resolutions [of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.] may have lost their
significance at the

    

present moment even for those who

       drafted[1]

them”. Many unity negotiations
      between us and the new-Iskrists have been held in the course of the past
      two or three months, hut the outcome of these negotiations so far has
      amounted to nothing.


We strongly protest against the attempt to silence us in the German
Social-Democratic press by means of such a crude, mechanical, and unheard-of
method as boycotting a pamphlet which contains only a translation of
the resolutions of the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and which was
issued by the Munich
Party publishing house of the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Germany (G. Birk
& Co.). Kautsky has no right to speak about his impartiality. He has always
been partial as regards the present struggle with in the Russian
Social-Democracy. This is his right, of course. But one who is partial would do
better not to speak too much of impartiality, if he does not want to be accused
of hypocrisy.


Kautsky tries to make out that all the resolutions of the Third Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. are “attacks by Lenin and his friends against Plekhanov and his
friends”. We have three brief remarks to make on this score. In the first
place, only four of the seventeen resolutions directly or indirectly touch on
our opponents within the R.S.D.L.P. Secondly, Plekhanov has now retired from the
Editorial Board of Iskra (see Iskra, No. 101). This shows how
little Kautsky understands our relations. Thirdly, we would ask the German
comrades to consider the impression that is likely to be created on the Russian
Social-Democrats when a man with Kautsky’s authority tries to discredit the work
of an entire Party Congress by “representing” it as “attacks
by Lenin and his friends”. What would people in Germany think of men who
(without having read the record of the proceedings) presumed to represent the
deliberations, say, of the Dresden Party Congress as an attack by Kautsky and
his friends...?


A word of warning to all the German Social-Democrats:
Comrades! If you really consider the R.S.D.L.P. to be a fraternal party, do not
believe a word of what the so-called impartial Germans tell you about our
split. Insist on seeing

    

the documents, the authentic documents. And do not forget that
prejudice is further from the truth than ignorance.


With Social-Democratic greetings,


The Editorial Board of the Central Organ (“Proletary”)
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party


P.S. The French socialists’ idea of impartiality differs from that of
the Germans. Their Central Organ Le Socialiste has just
published a translation of the resolutions of the Third Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. in a special supplement.

Setting: Tsarism in St. Petersburg struck down, the autocratic government
overthrown—struck down but not utterly destroyed, not killed, not
annihilated, not extirpated.


The provisional revolutionary government appeals to the people. Workers and
peasants

t a k e   t h e   i n i t i a t i v e.

Complete freedom. The people organise
their own lives. The government programme=full republican liberties,
peasant committees for the complete reform of agrarian relations. The
Programme of the Social-Democratic Party

i s   a   t h i n g   s t a n d i n g   b y
  i t s e l f.

Social-Democrats in the provisional government =people delegated,

c o m m i s s i o n e d

 by the Social-Democratic P a r t y.


Next— the Constituent Assembly. If the people have risen, they

 ...[1]
may (even though not immediately) find themselves in the
majority (peasants and workers). Ergo, the revolutionary

d i c t a t o r s h i p

of the proletariat and the peasantry.


Frantic resistance of evil forces. Civil war

i n   f u l l   s w e e p—annihilation

of tsarism.


Organisation of the proletariat grows, propaganda and agitation of the
Social-Democrats increases ten thousandfold—all the government
printing-presses, etc., etc. “Mit der Gründlichkeit der
geschichtlichen Aktion wird auch der Umfang der Masse zunehmen, deren Aktion sie

     ist.”[2]

 

The peasantry takes all agrarian relations, all the land, into
its own hands.

T h e n   n a t i o n a l i s a t i o n

becomes a fact.


Tremendous growth of productive forces—the entire rural intelligentsia,
all technical knowledge, is brought into action to increase agricultural
production, to get rid of fettering influences (uplifters, Narodniks, etc.,
etc.).... Gigantic development of capitalist progress....


War: the fort keeps changing hands. Either the bourgeoisie overthrows
the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, or this
dictatorship sets Europe aflame, and then...?


If we are to consider the question of revolutionary dictatorship from the
standpoint of Marxism, we shall have to reduce it to an analysis of the
struggle of the

  c l a s s e s.


Ergo, what major social forces should be taken into account? Ordre de
bataille?


(α) The bureaucratic, military, and Court elements stand for
absolutism

p l u s

the unenlightened elements among the people (a
rapidly disintegrating conglomerate, yesterday all-powerful, tomorrow
powerless). (Dynastic and other conflicts within inevitable.)


Degree of organisation very high—maximum

(β) The more or less big, moderately-liberal bourgeoisie.


(( Here I include the liberal landlords, the top financiers, the merchants,
manufacturers, etc., etc. This=σ lords
and masters of a bourgeois country. “Can do anything”. ))


Degree of organisation very slight


 Conflicts between the groupings inevitable; but all
stand for a Constitution even now, and still more so tomorrow.


Ideological leaders—in abundance, from among the officials, landlords, and
journalists.


(γ) The petty-bourgeois and peasant section. Tens of
millions.


The “people” par excellence.

 

Degree of organisation —minimum


Greatest state of benightedness and
      disorganisation.


 Their plight most desperate, they have most to gain directly
 from the revolution. The greatest instability (to day—for the
 revolution, tomorrow—for “law and order” after
 slight improvements).


D e m o c r a c y.   Ideological leaders—a great
   number of democratic intellectuals. The Socialist-Revolutionary
 “type”.


 (δ) The proletariat.


Very high level of organisation, and discipline


Revolutionary-minded. Critical attitude towards the petty bourgeoisie. Has
fewer ideological leaders than all the others—only the
Social-Democratic intelligentsia and the educated Social-Democratic
workers. Compared with the preceding groups numerically very much weaker, but

     Kampffähigkeit[3]

very much stronger.



Object of the struggle =Republic (including all
democratic liberties, the

m i n i m u m   p r o g r a m m e

 and far-reaching social reforms).


α—absolutely against.


β—for a Constitution, against the
Republic (&half and &half).  ((Bargaining.))


γ—in a revolutionary moment (not firmly) for the Republic
((the unstable
elements of the struggle)).


δ—wholly and entirely for the Republic.

An uprising and armed barricade fighting in Lodz, a bloody affray in
Ivanovo-Voznesensk, general strikes and shooting at workers in Warsaw and
Odessa, the ignominious end of the Zemstvo deputation farce—such are the
major political events of the past week. If we add to this what the Geneva
papers report today (June 28 [15]) concerning peasant disturbances in Lebedin
Uyezd, Kharkov Gubernia, the pillaging of five estates, and the dispatch of
troops to these places, we see, reflected in the events of a single week, the
character of all the main social forces, which is now so openly and clearly
revealing itself in the course of the revolution.


The proletariat has been in a constant state of unrest, especially since the
Ninth of January, never giving the enemy a moment’s respite. It is keeping up
its offensive mainly in the form of strikes, while avoiding direct clashes with
the armed forces of tsarism and preparing its forces for the great and decisive
battle. In the industrially more developed areas, where the workers are better
trained politically and where national oppression is added to the economic and
general political yoke, the tsarist police and troops are going out of their way
to incense and provoke the workers. And the workers, even those who are
unprepared for the struggle, even those who at first confined
themselves to defence, are now, through the proletariat of Lodz,
setting a new example, not only
of revolutionary enthusiasm and heroism, but of superior forms of struggle. They
are still poorly, very poorly armed, and their uprising is still

    

local, isolated from the general movement; nevertheless, they are making a step
      forward, they are covering the city streets with scores of barricades
      thrown up with amazing speed, they are inflicting serious losses on the
      tsarist troops, they are putting up a desperate resistance in some of the
      houses. The armed uprising is gaining in breadth and intensity. The new
      victims of the tsar’s executioners—nearly 2,000 people have, been
      killed or wounded in Lodz—are kindling intense hatred towards the
      accursed autocracy in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of
      citizens. The new armed clashes demonstrate more and more strikingly that
      the decisive armed struggle of the people against the armed forces of
      tsarism is inevitable. All these separate outbreaks form more and more
      distinctly the picture of a widespread all-Russian conflagration. More and
      more districts, even the most backward, are being drawn into the
      proletarian struggle, and the zeal of the tsar’s myrmidons but serves the
      revolution by turning economic conflicts into political conflicts, by
      making the workers everywhere realise from their own hard lot that the
      autocracy must be overthrown at all costs, and by making of them future
      heroes and fighters of the popular uprising.


Armed uprising of the people! This is the slogan—advanced so resolutely by
the party of the proletariat, as represent ed by the Third Congress of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party—which the very course of events,
the spontaneous process of expansion and intensification of the revolutionary
movement, powerfully impels. Away, then, with all doubts and vacillations. Let
it be realised by one and all, now and without delay, how absurd and
discreditable are all pretexts today for evading this urgent task of the most
energetic preparation of the armed uprising—how perilous it is to delay,
how vital it is to unite and co-ordinate the local uprisings which are breaking
out all over the country. Taken separately, these outbreaks are
ineffectual. The organised force of the tsarist government can crush
the insurgents group by group, if the movement continues to spread
from town to town
and from district to district as slowly and sporadically as it has been doing
until now. But united, these outbreaks can converge into a mighty torrent of
revolutionary flame, which no power on earth will be able to

    

withstand. This unity is on the way, it is coming by a thou sand paths we do not
know of or even suspect. These sporadic outbreaks and skirmishes are giving the
people a lesson in revolution, and our job is never to lag behind the exigencies
of the moment, but to be able always to point to the next, higher stage of the
struggle, deriving experience and instruction from the past and from the
present, and urging the workers and peasants on and on more boldly and more
broadly to the complete victory of the people, to the complete destruction of
the autocratic gang that is now fighting with the desperation of the doomed.


How often we would find people in the Social-Democratic, movement, particularly
in its intellectualist wing, who belittled the aims of the movement,
faint-hearts who have lost faith in the revolutionary energy of the working
class. Even now some think that because the democratic revolution is bourgeois
by its social and economic nature, the proletariat should not aspire to enact
the leading role in the revolution, to take the most energetic part in it, or to
put forward such advanced slogans as the overthrow of the tsarist regime and
the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government. Events are
teaching even these politically backward people. Events are bearing out the
militant conclusions that follow from the revolutionary theory of Marxism. The
bourgeois nature of the democratic revolution does not mean that this revolution
can benefit only the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, it is advantageous most of
all, and necessary most of all, to the proletariat and the peasantry. Events
are making it increasingly clear that only the proletariat is capable of waging
a determined struggle for complete liberty, for the republic, in
contradistinction to the unreliability and instability of the
bourgeoisie. The proletariat
can become the leader of the entire people and win over the peasantry, which can
expect nothing from the autocracy except oppression and violence, and nothing
from the bourgeois friends of the people except betrayal and treachery. Because
of its class position in modern society, the proletariat can understand, sooner
than any other class, that, in the final analysis, great historic issues are
decided only by force, that freedom cannot be achieved without tremendous
sacrifices, that the armed resistance of

    

tsarism must be broken and crushed by force of arms. Otherwise we shall never
      live to see liberty, otherwise Russia will meet the fate of
      Turkey—a long painful decline and disintegration, particularly
      painful for all the toiling and exploited masses of the people. Let the
      bourgeoisie abase itself and cringe, let it bargain and beg for sops, for
      a wretched travesty of liberty. The proletariat will go into action and
      lead with it the peasantry, which suffers under the vilest and most
      intolerable conditions of serfdom and humiliation; it will march forward
      to complete liberty, which can be made secure only by an armed people
      basing itself upon revolutionary power.


Social-Democracy has not advanced the slogan of insurrection on the spur of the
moment. It has always fought, and will continue to fight, against revolutionary
phrase-mongering, and it will always demand a sober estimation of forces and an
analysis of the given situation. The Social-Democratic Party has ever since
1902 spoken of preparing the uprising, without ever confounding this work of
preparation with the senseless artificial improvisation of rebellions which
would merely dissipate our forces uselessly. And only now, after the Ninth of
January, has the workers’ party placed the slogan of insurrection on the order
of the day, only now has the necessity of the uprising and the urgency of
mobilising for it been recognised. The autocracy itself has made this slogan a
practical slogan of the working-class movement. The autocracy has given the
broad masses their first lessons in civil war. This war has begun, and it is
being fought on an increasingly wider front and with increasing intensity. We
have only to generalise its lessons, to explain the great significance of the
words “civil war”, to derive practical guidance from each encounter
in this war, to organise our forces and prepare directly and immediately all
that is necessary for a real war.


Social-Democracy does not fear to face the truth. It knows the treacherous
nature of the bourgeoisie. It knows that liberty will bring the workers, not
tranquillity and peace, but the new and still greater struggle for socialism, a
struggle against the present bourgeois friends of freedom. But in spite of
this—indeed, because of this—freedom is absolutely necessary to the
workers, more necessary to them than to

    

anyone else. Only the workers are capable of fighting at the head of the people
for complete freedom, for a democratic republic. And they will fight for it to
the death.


Needless to say, ignorance and degradation are still wide spread among the
people; a good deal has yet to be done to develop the class-consciousness of the
workers, not to speak of the peasantry. But see how quickly the slave of
yesterday is straightening his back, how the spark of liberty is gleaming even
in his half-dimmed eyes. Look at the peasant movement. It lacks unity and
political consciousness, and we have only a faint inkling of its magnitude and
its character. But one thing we know: the class-conscious worker and the
peasant who is rising to the struggle will under stand each other upon the first
exchange of words; every ray of light will bring them closer together in the
struggle for freedom; they will then not surrender their revolution to
the contemptibly pusillanimous and selfish bourgeois and landlords—their
democratic revolution which can give them land and freedom, which can give the
working people every alleviation of their living conditions conceivable in
bourgeois society to enable them to continue the struggle for socialism. We need
but look at the central industrial region. How long is it since we thought it to
be sunk in deep slumber? How long is it since only a sporadic, partial, petty
trade union movement was considered possible there? And now a general strike has
broken out in that region. In the hundreds of thousands they have risen there,
and more are rising. Political agitation is spreading as never before. To be
sure, the workers there are still far behind the heroic proletariat of heroic
Poland, but the tsarist government is fast educating them; it is fast making
them “catch up with Poland”.


No, the general armed uprising of the people is no dream. The complete victory
of the proletariat and the peasantry in this democratic revolution is no idle
thought. And what great perspectives such a victory would open before the
European proletariat, which for so many years has been artificially held back
from the pursuit of happiness by the reactionary militarists and landlords! The
victory of the democratic revolution in Russia will be the signal for the
beginning of the socialist revolution, for a new victory of

    

our brothers, the class-conscious proletarians of all countries.


How utterly contemptible, as compared with the mighty and heroic struggle of the
proletariat, was the exhibition of loyalty displayed by the Zemstvo men and the
Osvobozhdeniye gentry at the famous audience granted by Nicholas
II. These mountebanks got their deserts. Before the ink had dried on their
grovelling and rapturous reports of the tsar’s gracious words, the true meaning
of those words was revealed to all in new deeds. The censorship is on the ram
page. The newspaper Rus[1]

has been suspended solely
for publishing a more than moderate address. The police dictatorship headed by
Trepov is in its hey day. The tsar’s words are officially interpreted as a
promise to call a consultative assembly of representatives of the
people, with the ancient autocracy “rooted in the native
soil” remaining inviolate.


Prince Meshchersky’s opinion of the reception, published in Grazhdanin,
proved to be right. Nicholas knew how to donner le change to the Zemstvo
men and the liberals, he wrote. Nicholas knew how to lead them by
the nose!


The gospel truth! The leaders of the Zemstvo people and of the
Osvobozhdeniye crowd have been led by the nose. It serves them
right. They got what they deserved for their servile speeches, for their
concealment of their true decisions and ideas on the constitution, and for
their shameful silence after the tsar’s jesuitical speech. They have haggled for
a parody of freedom that will be “safe” for the bourgeoisie. All
have haggled—Shipov with Bulygin, Trubetskoi with Shipov, Petrunkevich and
Rodichev with Trubetskoi, and Struve with Petrunkevich and Rodichev. They are
haggling while agreeing “provisionally” to the purely Shipovian
programme of the Zemstvo delegation. These hucksters got what they asked
for—a kick from the military jackboot.


Surely, this humiliation of the leaders of the Russian bourgeois
Osvobozhdeniye trend should mark the beginning of the end! Surely,
those who have the making of sincere and honest democrats will now at
last turn their backs on that notorious Constitutional-Democratic Party. Surely
they ought to realise that they are hopelessly disgracing themselves and
betraying the cause of the revolution by supporting

    

 a “party”, the “Zemstvo group” of which crawls on
its belly before the autocracy, while the Osvobozhdeniye League repeats
the like before the Zemstvo group.


We greet the finale of the Zemstvo deputation. The mask has been torn
off. Choose, gentlemen of the landowning classes and of the bourgeoisie! Choose,
gentlemen of education and members of “leagues” of every
description: for revolution or for counter-revolution? for freedom or against
freedom? He who would be a true democrat must fight, he must break with the
grovellers and traitors, he must create an honest party that will have respect
for itself and for its convictions, he must take his stand firmly and
irrevocably on the side of the armed uprising. As for those who want
to continue the
game of diplomatising, of withholding their true opinions, who want to bargain
and cringe, to make rhetorical threats believed by none and to go into raptures
at the promise of a post of Marshal of the Nobility from the deified
sovereign—as for such, let them be publicly branded with the unanimous
contempt of all believers in freedom.


Down with the bourgeois betrayers of freedom!


Long live the revolutionary proletariat! Long live the armed uprising for
complete freedom, for the republic, for the vital, urgent interests of the
proletariat and the peasantry!

All comrades know from the resolutions of the Third Congress of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party what our attitude should be, in point of
principle and organisation, towards the so-called Minority, or the
new-Iskrists. While recognising the need for an ideological struggle against the
survivals of “Economism”, the Third Congress ruled that adherents of
the Minority may be admitted to membership in Party organisations, provided they
recognise the congresses of the Party and submit to Party
discipline. Since this condition has not been met, all “Minority”
groups must be regarded as being outside the Party. Practical
agreements may, of course, be concluded with them at the discretion of
the Central Committee and the local committees, along the same lines as the
agreements with the Bund, etc.


At present all we can give the comrades is some information regarding the
section abroad of the seceded Minority. Immediately after the Congress the
C.C. wrote to the “League”, as well as to the heads of the technical
and financial departments of the Party, asking the former to state its attitude
to the Third Congress, and the latter to turn over the Party property to the
C.C. No reply was received to either of the letters. The new-Iskrists were not
averse to using the Party printing-house and store, and to receiving money from
the German Social-Democratic Party and from abroad in general, in the name of
the entire Party; but they showed no desire to account to the Party for the use
of Party property and the disbursement of Party funds. We consider comment on
such behaviour superfluous.

 

In the article on the Third Congress (Proletary,

No. 1[1]

)

we expressed
the wish that the breakaway group of the Party might at least organise itself
into some cohesive form as quickly as possible, since this would make agreements
easier and the path towards future unity clearer. Unfortunately, even this wish
of ours has proved almost unrealisable. The resolutions of the Minority
“Conference” have now been published (see the highly interesting
pamphlet, The First All-Russian Conference of Party Functionaries, a
separate supplement to Iskra, No. 100; also Iskra,
No. 100). We earnestly recommend this pamphlet to all Party organisations, for
we cannot imagine any better material than this for combating the ideas of the
breakaway section of the Party. These resolutions show the Minority’s total
incapacity to organise even its own followers. They could not even convene
their own Conference; we did it for them, the Bureau of Committees of the
Majority and the C.C., when we convened the Third Congress. The delegates of
the Menshevik organisations went to the Congress on the instructions of their
organisations, but arrived instead at the Conference! The Conference resolved
not to recognise the decisions of the Third Congress—and to rescind the
Party Rules adopted at the Second Congress! The Conference was unable
to constitute itself as a congress; its decisions were the decisions
of a
consultative assembly, subject to the approval of each
organisation. There is no complete list of the participants at the Conference,
nor are there any minutes. The organisations of the Minority can therefore only
give their ayes and noes to the question whether they will recognise
any particular resolution. Thus, a vote will be taken on the resolutions with no
opportunity for the voters to offer proposals for changes or to have before them
a complete record of the discussion of the resolutions. Heaven only knows how
these votes are to be counted, since the polls in favour of confirming or
rejecting particular sections of the resolutions may differ. We have here the
principle of Bonapartist plebiscites, as opposed to the principle of democratic
representation generally recognised by Social-Democrats the world over. With us,
democratically elected and responsible representatives

    

 of qualified organisations consult with one another and reach a
      decision. With them, representatives as well as guests confer and make
      proposals, and the qualified organisations vote aye or no post
      factum. It is difficult to imagine a system better suited for
    disorganising the Social-Democrats. In practice this system of plebiscites
    always ends in a farce.


The Rules adopted by the Conference and consisting of thirteen clauses are a gem
of their kind. They erect a six storey party structure rising in the following
order:

(1) Directing Board;

(2) Committee;

(3) Regional Congress;

(4) Regional Committee;

(5) Conference; and

(6) Executive Committee. Generally speaking, the
lower body elects the higher. But the relations between the Directing Board and
the Committee are not based on the principle of election but on the principle
of “agreement”, as the new-Iskrists see it, or on the principle of
“confusion”, as we see it. On the one hand, the Committee is
included en bloc in the membership of the Directing Board, together
with all the members, not only of the District Committees, but of “the
groups working among the special sections of the population”. On the other
hand, “the District Committee includes also a representative of the
Committee”! On the one hand, all important decisions must come from the
Directing Board; on the other, in emergency cases, the Committee may act on its
own initiative “before inviting the opinion [!] of the District
Committees”. What is more, “the Committee is obliged to
report
periodically on its activities to the district committees If a majority of the
members of the District Committees express no confidence in the Committee, the
latter is reorganised “by mutual agreement between the Regional
Committee and the District Committees”. Neither the powers nor
the composition
of the other Party organisations (including the District Committee) are defined
in any way. The concept of Party membership, of which the Mensheviks made a
major issue at the Second Congress, has been jettisoned! Hereto fore the
principle of “agreement” among members of one and the same
organisation or party, who sing in unison on all essential questions of
programme and tactics, was regarded as an anarchist principle. Social-Democrats
throughout the world have in such cases always followed the principle

    

of the subordination of the minority to the majority. The new-Iskrists want to
show the world a shining example of the manner in which these two principles can
be commingled in the most “poetic” disorder. Recently we came across
a copy of a German newspaper bearing the motto, “Weder Autorität noch
Majorität” (“Neither Authority nor Majority”), a principle
akin to the organisation-as-process theory of the new-Iskrists. The newspaper is
the organ of the German anarchists: Der Anarchist.


In the election of the centre (“the body that unifies all Party work”) the
new-Iskrists prefer indirect voting, through electors, to direct voting. The
Executive Committee is not elected by the direct vote of the representatives of
the Directing Boards, but in four stages! Why this sudden dislike of
direct elections God alone knows. Some people wonder whether the new-Iskrists
may not have been influenced by the example of Mr. Struve, who wants the Upper
House to be elected by universal suffrage, but not by direct vote. How this
four-stage election is to be carried out, again God alone knows, for there is
not a word about it in the “Rules”.


Obviously it would be absurd to take the Rules seriously, though we have not
exhausted their charms by far. They will never be put into practice. The
six-decker bus would not be able to budge an inch, even if it could be
built. These Rules are of importance, not for their practical value, but as a
statement of principles. They are a superb, peerless illustration of the famous
“organisation-as process” theory. Now even the blind must see that
organisation-as-process means disorganisation. Hitherto the Mensheviks have
acted as disorganisers of their opponents, of the Second Congress and the bodies
created by it. Now they act as disorganisers of their own followers. This is
truly disorganisation exalted to a principle.


That the Mensheviks have begun by breaking their own Rules does not surprise
us. They have mapped out no scheme for the division of Russia into regions. They
have elected no Executive Committee, not even pro tem., pending the
confirmation of the committees and organisations. The Conference elected an
Organisation Committee, which was not provided for in the Rules, and assigned to
it special

    

tasks! At present even temporary and partial agreements with the Mensheviks are
      made extremely difficult, for this Organisation Committee lacks official
      status, and no steps that it takes can have decisive significance. Anyone
      desiring to have dealings with the Mensheviks must now take the trouble of
      communicating with each of their organisations separately, and even with
      each individual “Pan” who may say, “Nie

   pozwalam!”[2]


Finally, the most astonishing thing about the “Rules” of the
Minority is the omission of all reference to Party organs and to Party
literature in general. Organs there are (Iskra,
Sotsial-Demokrat[4])

and will be, but the “Rules” adopted by the Conference establish
no connection between them and the Party. This is incredible, but it is
a fact. The publicists are outside the Party, above the Party. No control, no
reports, no material dependence. Something reminiscent of the worst days of
opportunism among the French socialists: the Party unto itself, and the
publicists unto themselves. From this point of view the following decision of
the Conference, viz., the resolution on Party (?) literature, should
perhaps not seem accidental: “The Conference deems it necessary: (1) that
the Organisation Committee take measures to furnish the Party publicists greater
possibilities to wage a struggle in the legal press for the theoretical
principles of the Party”. A kind of prototype of Menshevik organisation:
a group of “Party publicists”, non-responsible and
“independent”, indispensable and irreplaceable. And attached to
them—a committee to have charge of the work of ... legal publication!


It is difficult to discuss this type of organisation with the necessary
seriousness. The nearer the revolution and the nearer the opportunity for
Social-Democrats to write openly in the “legal” press, the more
strictly should the party of the proletariat adhere to the principle of the
unconditional responsibility of “Party publicists” to the Party, of
their dependence on the Party.


As regards the tactical resolutions of the Conference, they admirably confirm
the declaration of the Third Congress

    

on the shadings of Social-Democracy “akin to Economism”, and on
“the constriction of the scope of Party work”. We shall say nothing
of the incredibly careless editing of the resolutions, which rather resemble
jottings, aphorisms, reflections, and scraps of rough copy. In this respect the
resolutions of the Conference can be rivalled only by the “Programme of
the Osvobozhdeniye League”. Instead of precise, clear-cut
directives issued by the highest body of the Party, we find here ... stylistic
exercises of some Party literati.


To take the contents. On the pressing question of the uprising, we are not told
that it has become “essential”; that it is necessary to elucidate,
not only its political significance, but its “practical and organisational
aspect”; that we must “organise the proletariat” to this end
and “form special groups as the need arises”. (Resolution of the
Third Congress.) Not at all. First we are told that the possibility of timing
the uprising and preparing it by methods of secret organisation is
“excluded”; we then read that, with broader agitation and
organisation, it is possible to convert spontaneous movements into
“planned insurrections”. From this muddle the party of the
proletariat is expected to derive ideological guidance! The Third Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. repeats and confirms all the old truths about
propaganda, agitation, the general democratic movement, etc., but adds
to this a new task: to organise the proletariat for the uprising, to elucidate
the “practical and organisational aspect” of new methods
of struggle, of the determined struggle for freedom. The Conference speaks only
of “the preparation of the uprising” in general, with stale
repetitions about agitation and organisation in general; it cannot bring itself
to formulate a single new task independently, it advances no guiding slogan on
the necessity to take a step forward from the general preparation, of which we
have spoken since 1902, to the treatment of the matter from the point of view of
practical organisation. Like the old Economists to a T. When new tasks of the
political struggle emerged upon the scene, they were belittled, broken up into
stages, and subordinated to the tasks of the economic struggle.


Not only economic struggle, but political struggle, and in the broadest and
boldest forms, said the revolutionary Social-Democrats. The best means of
political agitation is

    

economic struggle, answered the Economists. Not only propaganda and agitation in
      general, the revolutionary Social-Democrats now say, not only
      clarification of the political significance of the uprising, but also the
      formation of special groups, the immediate commencement of practical
      organisational work, “the most energetic measures for the arming of
      the proletariat.” A planned uprising is excluded, retort the
      new-Iskrists; we must expand agitation, strengthen organisation, prepare
      the conversion of the spontaneous into the planned; only in this way
      “can the moment of insurrection be brought nearer”, only in
      this way “can the technical fighting preparations acquire more or
      less serious importance”....


For them the moment of insurrection has not yet “come near”! For them the
practical preparations have still to “acquire more or less serious
importance”! Is this not tail-ism par excellence? Is this not a
degradation of the “urgent” task (urgent in the opinion of the Third
Congress), towards which we have as yet done dreadfully little? Are not these
people backing away from uprising to agitation, as the Economists backed away
from political struggle to economic struggle with the employers and the
government? Read in Osvobozhdeniye, No. 71, how Mr. Struve is backing
away from the slogan of the “armed uprising”, how this leader of the
liberal bourgeoisie is questioning the inevitability of the uprising (p. 340),
how he lays himself out to minimise the importance of “the technical
aspect of the revolution”, how he “gives depth” to
the slogan of the uprising by pointing to the “socio-psychical
conditions”, how he substitutes for this slogan the slogan of
“imbuing the masses with the ideas of democratic reform”— and you
will understand what a profoundly demoralising influence the tail-ism of the
new-Iskrists must exercise on the proletariat, and into whose hands it plays.


The second urgent political question is that of the provisional revolutionary
government. This question is clearly and distinctly formulated in the resolution
of the Third Congress. The preamble speaks of the struggle for the republic,
which can be won only through a completely successful uprising; of the need for
the convocation of the Constituent Assembly by a provisional revolutionary
government in order to guarantee truly free and fair elections; of the need to

    

prepare for the struggle with the bourgeoisie to safeguard the gains of the
revolution. The conclusions and directives of the Congress: The proletariat must
be made to realise the need for a provisional revolutionary government. The
proletariat must put clearly defined demands before this government, namely, the
realisation of the entire minimum programme. Social-Democrats may participate in
the government (action “from above”), the object of such participation
being clearly specified (a ruthless struggle against counter revolution and
defence of the independent interests of the working class). The conditions of
such participation are made equally explicit. The formal condition is strict
control by the Party; the material condition, i.e., the condition determining
the expediency of such participation, is jealous preservation of the
independence of the Social-Democratic position and the creation of the
conditions for the socialist revolution. This enumeration of the conditions of
participation in the government, the conditions of pressure from above, as a
new form of activity characteristic of the revolutionary epoch, is supplemented
by an indication of the form and the purpose of pressure from below, which must
be steadily maintained under all circumstances — pressure on the
provisional revolutionary government by the armed proletariat led by the
Social-Democratic Party. Broadly, we have here a complete answer to the
new political question, a precise indication of the significance of the
new forms of struggle and their purpose, of the programme of the
struggle and the conditions under which these forms may be employed.


And in the Conference resolution? The resolution begins with the grossly
erroneous assertion that “the decisive victory of the revolution
over tsarism” may be signalised either by the establishment of a
provisional government “or by the revolutionary initiative of a
representative institution, which, under the direct revolutionary pressure of
the people, decides to organise a popular Constituent Assembly”.


The Party may and should be given tactical directions both for the contingency
of a victory of the uprising and for the contingency of its defeat, both for the
contingency of the convocation of a true Constituent Assembly along
revolutionary lines and for the contingency of the convocation of

    

a travesty of popular representation by the tsar. But to apply the term decisive
      victory to something that lacks the essential element of victory is to
      confuse the revolutionary consciousness, not to lead it. Any
      “decision” of any representative institution to organise a
      Constituent Assembly is as far removed from decisive victory as word is
      from deed; for the tsarist government wields the power that can prevent
      word from becoming deed. There is nothing whatever to choose between the
      resolution of the new-Iskrists and the affirmation of the old Economists
      that the decisive victory of the workers may consist either in their
      winning the eight-hour day or in the government’s granting them the
      ten-hour day, from which stage the workers will pass to the nine-hour
      day.


The Conference resolution repeats the incontestable theses of Marxism on the
bourgeois nature of the democratic revolution, but interprets them narrowly or
incorrectly. Instead of the militant slogan of “Republic”, we are
given a description of the process of “liquidation of the monarchist
regime”. Instead of setting forth the conditions and tasks of the
new method of struggle “from above”, which can and must be
employed in a successful course of the proletarian uprising in the epoch of
revolution, we are given the guiding rule “to remain the party of the
extreme revolutionary opposition”. This is a very useful thesis for the
parliamentary struggle and action from below, but it would certainly be
inadequate in the time of insurrection. At such a time the task of the
“opposition” consists in the violent overthrow of the government;
on this question the Conference was unable to offer a guiding slogan.


While admitting the possibility of partial and sporadic “seizures of
power” in separate cities and districts, the Conference resolution
abandons the “principle” of the new Iskra that
participation in a provisional revolutionary government with the bourgeoisie
constitutes a betrayal of the proletariat, that it is Millerandism,
etc. Betrayal that is partial and sporadic is betrayal

none the less. 

Limiting
the problem to separate cities and districts does not solve it, however, but
merely divides our attention and splits up the question, thereby befogging the
issue. Lastly, the slogan of “revolutionary communes”, embodied in
the Conference

    

 resolution, is more like an empty phrase on account of its unclarity, in
contrast to the slogan of the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the
proletariat and the peasantry.


The resolution of the new-Iskrists on the provisional revolutionary government
suffers from the very fault that glares from their resolution on insurrection,
namely, an inability to determine the new tactical tasks of the moment;
reiteration of the much reiterated instead of the summons to go forward; the
lack of a guiding slogan for the advanced class in the democratic revolution; a
belittlement of the tasks and the scope of activity of this class, of its revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary energy. The political tendency of this
erroneous tactical line is to bring new Iskrism closer to
Osvobozhdeniye-ism, to yield the leadership in the democratic
revolution to the liberal bourgeoisie, to make the proletariat a mere satellite
of the liberal bourgeoisie.


This basic error manifests itself also in the minor resolutions of the
Conference. Thus, instead of the slogan of winning the eight-hour day by
revolutionary means (resolution of the Third Congress), the old, now inadequate
slogan of campaigning for the legislative introduction of the eight-hour day is
put forward. Instead of the call for the immediate organisation of revolutionary
peasant committees, we have the proposal solely to bring to the Constituent
Assembly the demand for their formation. Instead of the slogan of combating the
inconsistency, narrowness, and inadequacy of the liberation movement of the
bourgeoisie wherever these traits manifest themselves (resolution of the Third
Congress), the Conference resolution, repeating Starover’s error, pursues the
illusory aim of finding “the litmus paper”, of enumerating the
“points” conformity with which, if he meets them, entitles the
bourgeois democrat to be called a true friend of the people. Of course, the
“points” in the resolution of the new-Iskrists have shown
themselves to be incomplete. The demand for the republic is missing. One is
left to conclude that a democratic group like the “Russian Liberation
Union” (Proletary,

No. 4[3]

)

conforms to these

    

“points”, although in reality there is no guarantee whatever that the
    Osvobozhdeniye crowd will not predominate in
this group.

It need hardly be said that in a newspaper article we could only give a very
brief and general idea of the main error pervading the new Iskra’s
tactical line, as expressed in the Conference resolutions. The erroneous
tendencies of the new Iskra’s tactical line are as serious and
important to the Party as its “organisation-as-process” is not
serious. We therefore deal with these tendencies in detail in a special pamphlet
which is now in the press and will appear very shortly.[5]

Dear Citizens,


The editors of Proletary received a telegram today from Berlin. A
comrade asks us to inform the International Socialist Bureau that, according to
a private telegram to the Berliner Tageblatt, the Russian Government
has requested the powers to dispatch their ships stationed at Constantinople
to Odessa to help restore order in that city.


It is quite possible that the Russian Government, no longer trusting its own
naval forces, will try to make the warships of European states fight against the
Russian revolution under the pretext of defending the foreign residents
of Odessa.


Thus, there is a great danger that the European peoples may be forced to play
the part of executioners of Russian freedom. Therefore we request you, dear
citizens, to consider this question and seek the means of preventing such an
eventuality. Perhaps it would be advisable to publish in the name of the
International Socialist Bureau an appeal to the workers of all countries. The
appeal should emphasise that what is taking place in Russia is not mob rioting,
but a revolution, a struggle for freedom, that this struggle has as its object
the convocation of a Constituent Assembly, which is demanded by all progressive
parties, in the first place by the Social-Democratic Labour Party of
Russia. Perhaps such an appeal, translated into all languages, printed in the
socialist press of the entire world and distributed by every means at our
disposal, will be able to influence public opinion and frustrate the designs of
the Russian Government—designs that would be fatal to freedom.

 

We hope that you will let us know your opinion on this matter.


Accept, dear citizens, our fraternal greetings.


On behalf of the Central Committee of the S.D.L.P. of Russia


N. Lenin (Vl. Ulyanov)

    WHAT PURPOSE SHALL THESE SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT SERVE?

ABSOLUTE MONARCHY


That the courtiers, the police, and the officials may live on the

    will;
that the people may remain for ever without rights and live in
    darkness and ignorance.


CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY


That the police and the officials may be dependent on the
    capitalists and landlords;

    easily rob the workers of town and country, by right and not by
    arbitrary rule.


DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC


That the free and enlightened people may learn to run things
    themselves, and, principally, that the working class may be free to
    struggle for socialism, for a system under which there will be
    neither rich nor poor and all the land, all the factories and works,
    will belong to all the working people.

The uprising in Odessa and the siding of the armoured cruiser Potemkin
with the revolution marked a further big step forward in the development of the
revolutionary movement against the autocracy. Events have confirmed with
amazing rapidity the timeliness of the calls to insurrection and to the
formation of a provisional revolutionary government, which were addressed to
the people by the class-conscious spokesmen of the proletariat as represented
by the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. The new
outbreak of the revolutionary conflagration throws light on the practical
significance of these calls and makes us determine more precisely the tasks of
the revolutionary fighters in the present situation in Russia.


The armed uprising of the people is maturing and is organising itself before
our very eyes under the impact of the spontaneous course of events. It was not
so very long ago that the only manifestation of the people’s struggle against
the autocracy was revolts–unconscious, unorganised,
spontaneous, sometimes wild
outbreaks. But the labour movement, as the movement of the most advanced class,
the proletariat, rapidly outgrew this initial stage. The goal-conscious
propaganda and agitation carried on by the Social-Democrats had their
effect. Disturbances gave way to organised strike struggles and political
demonstrations against the autocracy. The brutal military reprisals of the
past few years have “educated” the proletariat and the common people
of the towns, and have prepared them for higher forms of revolutionary
struggle. The criminal and ignominious war into which the autocracy has plunged
the

    

people filled the cup of their endurance to overflowing. The crowds began to
offer armed resistance to the tsarist troops. Real street fighting,
barricade battles, started between the people and the troops. Quite
recently the Caucasus, Lodz, Odessa, and Libau have shown us examples of
proletarian heroism and popular enthusiasm. The struggle grew into an
insurrection. Even the tsar’s troops gradually began to see that they were being
made to play the shameful role of executioners of freedom, of henchmen of the
police. And the army began to waver. At first isolated cases of
insubordination, outbreaks among reservists, protests from officers, propaganda
among the soldiers, refusal of some companies and regiments to shoot at their
own brothers, the workers. Then—the siding of part of the army with
the uprising.


The tremendous significance of the recent events in Odessa lies precisely in the
fact that, for the first time, an important unit of the armed force of
tsarism—a battle ship—has openly gone over to the side of the
revolution. The government made frantic efforts and resorted to all possible
tricks to conceal this event from the people, to stifle the mutiny of the
sailors from the outset. But to no avail. The warships sent against the
revolutionary armoured cruiser “Potemkin” refused to fight
against their comrades. By spreading throughout Europe the report that the
Potemkin had surrendered and that the tsar had ordered the
revolutionary armoured cruiser to be sunk, the autocratic government only
completed its disgrace in the eyes of the entire world. The squadron has
returned to Sevastopol, and the government is hastening to disband the crews and
to disarm the warships; reports are current of wholesale resignations of
officers of the Black Sea Fleet; a fresh mutiny broke out on the armoured
cruiser Georgi Pobedonosets, which had surrendered. The sailors are
also rising in Libau and in Kronstadt; clashes with the troops are becoming more
frequent; sailors and workers are fighting the troops on the barricades (in
Libau). The foreign press reports mutinies on a number of other warships (the
Minin, the Alexander II, and others). The tsarist government
finds itself without a navy. The most that it has been able to achieve
so far is to hold back the fleet from actively going over to the side of

    

the revolution. Meanwhile, the armoured cruiser Potemkin remains an
    unconquered territory of the revolution, and what ever its fate may be, the
    undoubted fact and the point of highest significance is that here we have
    the attempt to form the nucleus of a revolutionary army.


No reprisals, no partial victories over the revolution can diminish the
importance of this event. The first step has been taken. The Rubicon has been
crossed. The siding of the army with the revolution has impressed itself as a
fact upon the whole of Russia and the entire world. The events in the Black Sea
Fleet will inevitably be followed by further and still more energetic attempts
to form a revolutionary army. It is our task now to give the utmost support to
these efforts, to explain to the broadest masses of the proletariat and the
peasantry the nation-wide significance of a revolutionary army in the struggle
for freedom, to assist various units of this army to unfurl the popular
banner of freedom, the banner capable of attracting the masses and
rallying the forces that will crush the tsarist autocracy.


Outbreaks— demonstrations—street fighting—units of a
revolutionary army—such are the stages in the development of the popular
uprising. Now at last we have reached the final stage. This does not mean, of
course, that the movement in its entirety has advanced to this new and higher
stage. No, there is still a good deal of backwardness in the movement; in the
Odessa events there are unmistakable signs of old-time rioting. But it does mean
that the advance waves of the elemental flood have already reached the very
threshold of the absolutist “stronghold”. It does mean that the
advanced representatives of the popular masses have themselves arrived, not as
a result of theoretical reasoning, but under the impact of the growing movement,
at new and higher tasks of the struggle, the final struggle against the enemy of
the Russian people. The autocracy has done everything to prepare this
struggle. For years it has provoked the people to an armed struggle with its
troops, and now it is reaping what it sowed. The units of the revolutionary army
are springing up out of the army itself.


The task of these units is to proclaim the insurrection, to give the masses
military leadership, as essential in civil war as in any other war; to
create strong points for the open

    

mass struggle; to spread the uprising to neighbouring districts; to establish
complete political freedom, if only at first in a small part of the country; to
embark on the revolutionary transformation of the decayed absolutist system;
and to give full scope to the revolutionary creative activity of the masses, who
participate but little in this activity in time of peace, but who come to the
forefront in revolutionary epochs. Only by clearly understanding these new
tasks, only by posing them boldly and broadly, can the units of the
revolutionary army win complete victory and become the strong points of a
revolutionary government. And a revolutionary government is as vitally
essential at the present stage of the popular uprising as a revolutionary
army. The revolutionary army is needed for military struggle and for military
leadership of the masses against the remnants of the military forces of the
autocracy. The revolutionary army is needed because great historical issues can
be re solved only by force, and, in modern struggle, the
organisation of force means military organisation. Besides
the remnants of the
autocracy’s military forces there are the military forces of the neighbouring
states for whose support the tottering Russian Government is already begging, of
which

later.[1]


The revolutionary government is needed for the political leadership of the
masses, at first in that part of the country which has been wrested from tsarism
by the revolutionary army, and later in the country at large. The revolutionary
government is needed for the immediate launching of the political reforms, for
the sake of which the revolution is being made—the establishment of a
revolutionary self-government of the people, the convocation of a
truly popular and truly Constituent Assembly, and the introduction of
“liberties” without which there can be no true expression of the
people’s will. The revolutionary government is necessary for the political
unification and the political organisation of the insurgent section of the
people ,which has actually and finally broken away from the autocracy. Of
course, that political organisation can only be provisional, just as the
revolutionary government, which has taken power in

    

the name of the people in order to enforce the will of the people and to act
      through the instrumentality of the people, can only be provisional. But
      this work of organisation must start immediately, and it must be
    indissolubly combined with every successful step of the uprising; for
    political consolidation and political leadership cannot be delayed for a
    single moment. Immediate political leadership of the insurgent people is no
    less essential for the complete victory of the people over tsarism than the
    military leadership of its forces.


No one who is at all capable of forming a judgement can doubt the eventual
outcome of the struggle between the supporters of the autocracy and the masses
of the people. Yet we must not shut our eyes to the fact that the serious
struggle is only beginning, that there are great trials in store for us. Both
the revolutionary army and the revolutionary government are
“organisms” of so high a type, they demand institutions so
complicated and a civic consciousness so developed, that it would be a mistake
to expect a simple, immediate, and perfect fulfilment of these tasks from the
outset. No, we do not expect that; we are able to appreciate the importance of
the slow, steady, and often imperceptible work of political education which
Social-Democrats have always conducted and always will conduct. But we must not
allow what in the present circumstances would be still more dangerous—a
lack of faith in the powers of the people. We must remember what a tremendous
educational and organising power the revolution has, when mighty historical
events force the man in the street out of his remote corner, garret, or basement
and make a citizen out of him. Months of revolution sometimes educate
citizens more quickly and fully than decades of political stagnation. The task
of the class-conscious leaders of the revolutionary class is always to march
ahead of it in the matter of education, to explain to it the meaning of the new
tasks, and to urge it forward towards our great ultimate goal. The failures
inevitably involved in our further attempts to form a revolutionary army and a
provisional revolutionary government will only teach us to meet these tasks
in practice; they will serve to draw the new and fresh forces of the
people, now lying dormant, to the work of solving them.

 

To take the military aspect. No Social-Democrat at all familiar with history,
who has studied Engels, the great expert on this subject, has ever doubted the
tremendous importance of military knowledge, of military technique, and of
military organisation as an instrument which the masses of the people, and
classes of the people, use in resolving great historical
conflicts. Social-Democracy never stooped to playing at military conspiracies;
it never gave prominence to military questions until the actual conditions of
civil war had

       arisen.[2]

But now all Social-Democrats have advanced the
military questions, if not to the first place, at least to one of the first
places, and they are putting great stress on studying these questions and
bringing them to the knowledge of the masses. The revolutionary army must apply
the military knowledge and the military means on the practical plane for the
determination of the further destiny of the Russian people, for the
determination of the most vital and pressing question—the question of
freedom.


Social-Democracy has never taken a sentimental view of war. It unreservedly
condemns war as a bestial means of settling conflicts in human society. But
Social-Democracy knows that so long as society is divided into classes, so long
as there is exploitation of man by man, wars are inevitable. This exploitation
cannot be destroyed without war, and war is always and everywhere begun by the
exploiters themselves, by the ruling and oppressing classes. There are wars and
wars. There are adventurist wars, fought to further dynastic interests, to
satisfy the appetite of a band of freebooters, or to attain the objects of the
knights of capitalist profit. And there is another kind of war—the only
war that is legitimate in capitalist society—war against the
people’s oppressors and enslavers. Only utopians and philistines can condemn
such a war on principle. Only the bourgeois betrayers of freedom can stand aloof
from such a war in Russia today, the war for the people’s freedom. The
proletariat in Russia has started

    

that great war of liberation, and it will, go on with it, forming units of a
      revolutionary army, reinforcing the units of the soldiers or sailors that
      have come over to its side, enlisting the peasants, imbuing the new
    citizens of Russia, formed and steeled in the fire of civil war,
    with the heroism and enthusiasm of fighters for the freedom and happiness of
    all mankind.


The task of establishing a revolutionary government is as new, as difficult, and
as complicated as the task of the military organisation of the revolutionary
forces. But this task, too, can and must be fulfilled by the people. In this
matter, too, every partial failure will lead to an improvement in methods and
means, to the consolidation and extension of the results. The Third Congress of
the R.S.D.L.P. outlined in its resolution the general conditions for dealing
with this new task; it is now time to consider and prepare the conditions for
its practical realisation. Our Party has a minimum programme, a complete
programme of the changes that are immediately achievable within the framework of
the democratic (i.e., bourgeois) revolution, and which the proletariat needs in
its further struggle for the triumph of the socialist revolution. But this
programme contains basic demands, as well as partial demands that follow from
the basic ones or are assumed. In every attempt to establish a provisional
revolutionary government it is important to advance precisely the basic demands
in order to show to the whole of the people, even to the most unenlightened
masses, in brief formulation, in sharp and clear outline, the aims of this
government and its tasks that are of significance to the entire people.


There are, in our view, six such fundamental points that must become
the political banner and the immediate programme of any revolutionary
government. They should enlist the sympathy of the people for that government
and should be regarded as the most urgent task, upon the accomplishment of
which the whole revolutionary energy of the people must be concentrated.


The six points are:

(1) a Constituent. Assembly of all the people,

(2) arming of
the people,

(3) political freedom,

(4) complete freedom for the oppressed and
disfranchised nationalities,

(5) the eight-hour day, and

(6) peasant
revolutionary

    

committees. Of course, this is only a tentative list, representing the
headings, the designations, of a series of changes that are required
immediately for winning the democratic republic. We do not claim that the list
is complete. We merely want to stress the importance of certain basic
tasks. The revolutionary government must strive to secure the support of the
masses, of the mass of the working class and of the peasantry; short of doing
this, it will not be able to maintain itself; without the revolutionary activity
of the people it will be a mere nothing, worse than nothing. It is our duty to
warn the people against the adventurism of high-sounding but absurd promises
(like immediate “socialisation”, which even its advocates do not
under stand), while at the same time we must propose changes that are really
practicable at the present moment and really necessary for strengthening the
cause of the revolution. The revolutionary government must rouse the
“people” and organise its revolutionary activity. Complete
freedom for the oppressed nationalities, i. e., the recognition, not only of
their cultural, but of their political, self-determination; the introduction of
urgent measures for the protection of the working class (the eight-hour day as
the first in a series of such measures), and lastly, the guarantee of serious
measures, without regard for the egotistic interests of the land lords, in
favour of the mass of the peasantry—such, in our opinion, are the chief
points that every revolutionary government must especially emphasise. We shall
not discuss the first three points, which are too obvious to require
comment. Nor shall we discuss the need for practically implementing reforms even
in a small territory, one, for instance, that has been wrested from tsarism;
practical implementation is a thousand times more important than manifestos,
and, of course, a thousand times more difficult. We merely wish to draw
attention to the fact that it is necessary now, without delay, to spread by
every possible means a correct idea of our general and immediate tasks. We must
know how to appeal to the people—in the true sense of the word—not
only with a general call to struggle (this suffices in the period preceding the
formation of the revolutionary government), but with a direct call for the
immediate implementation

    

 of the most essential democratic reforms, for their independent
      realisation without delay.


The revolutionary army and the revolutionary government are two sides of the
same medal. They are two institutions equally necessary for the success of the
uprising and for the consolidation of its results. They are two slogans which
must be advanced and explained as· the only consistent revolutionary
slogans. There are many people today who call themselves democrats; however,
many are called, but few are chosen. There are many spokesmen of the
“Constitutional-Democratic Party”; but in so-called
“society”, in the would-be democratic Zemstvos, there are few
true democrats, men who are sincerely in favour of the complete
sovereignty of the people and are capable of waging a life-and-death struggle
against the enemies of that sovereignty, the defenders of the tsarist
autocracy.


The working class is free of the cowardice, the hypocritical half-heartedness
that is characteristic of the bourgeoisie as a class. The working class can and
must be fully and consistently democratic. The working class has proved its
right to the role of vanguard in the democratic revolution by the blood it has
shed on the streets of St. Petersburg, Riga, Libau, Warsaw, Lodz, Odessa, Baku,
and many other cities. It must prove equal to this great role at the present
decisive moment too. While never for a moment forgetting their socialist goal,
their class and Party independence, the class-conscious representatives of the
proletariat, the members of the R.S.D.L.P., must come forward before the whole
of the people with the advanced democratic slogans. For us, for the proletariat,
the democratic revolution is only the first step on the road to the complete
emancipation of labour from all exploitation, to the great socialist goal. All
the more quickly, therefore, must we pass this first stage; all the more
decisively must we settle accounts with the enemies of the people’s freedom; all
the louder must we proclaim the slogans of consistent democracy: a
revolutionary army and a revolutionary government.

The foreign press of all countries and all parties is teeming with reports,
telegrams, and articles concerning the siding of part of the Black Sea Fleet
with the Russian revolution. The newspapers are at a loss for words in which to
express their astonishment; they find no terms strong enough to describe the
disgrace which the autocratic government has brought upon itself.


The peak in this disgrace was the tsarist government’s appeal to Rumania and
Turkey for police assistance against the mutinous sailors. Here is proof
positive that the “Turks within” are a greater menace to the Russian
people than all the “Turks without”. The Sultan of Turkey is to
protect the tsarist autocracy from the Russian people; the tsar cannot rely on
Russia s armed forces, and so he begs other powers for help. Better proof of the
utter bankruptcy of the tsarist regime can hardly be imagined. Better material
to make the soldiers of the Russian army see the role they are playing could
hardly be found.


Observe what The Times of July 4 (new style) writes editorially. It
should be noted that this is one of the most affluent and best-informed
newspapers in the world, and that this mouthpiece of the conservative English
bourgeoisie finds even our Osvobozhdeniye liberals
over-radical, sympathises with the “Shipovians”, etc. In a
word, no one can possibly
suspect it of exaggerating the strength and importance of the Russian
revolution.


“The impotence of the [Russian] Government at sea,” writes The
Times, “receives a striking illustration from the Note it is stated
to have sent to the Porte, [i.e., to the

    

Turkish Government I and to the Government of Rumania. This
    document [of the Russian Government] calls upon the Governments in question
    to treat the mutinous sailors of the Russian fleet as common criminals, and
    warns them that should they act otherwise international complications may
    follow. In other words, the Government of the Tsar is stooping to beg the
    Sultan of Turkey and the King of Rumania to be good enough
    to do for him the police work which he is no longer able to do for
    himself. Whether Abdul Hamid will condescend to give him the
    required assistance or not remains to be seen. So far the only result of the
    mutiny upon the Turkish authorities has been to induce them to exhibit
    unusual vigilance, and the first exhibition of it has been that they fired a
    blank shot across the bows of the Russian guardship on Saturday, when she
    was entering the Bosporus after dark with the Russian Ambassador
    on board. They would hardly have asserted their watchfulness in
    that fashion twelve months ago. The Government of Rumania rightly
    ignored the demand
    that the mutineers should be treated as criminals, as was to be expected
    from the rulers of a self-respecting nation. They issued orders that the
    mutineers were not to be furnished with coals or provisions, but they
    informed the 700 sailors on board the Kniaz Potemkin that if they
    choose to land they will be treated only as foreign deserters.


And so the Rumanian Government does not in the least side with the revolution;
far from it! Yet it has no desire to stoop to police service for the universally
hated and despised tsar of all the Russias. It refuses the tsar’s request. It
acts in the only way the “government of a self-respecting
nation” can act.


That is how the Russian autocracy is now spoken of in Europe by those who only
yesterday fawned on the “great and mighty monarch”!


Now comes confirmation in the German press as well of this new, unheard-of
disgrace of the autocracy. A report telegraphed to the Frankfurter
Zeitung from Constantinople under date of July 4 (N.S.) states:
“The Russian Ambassador Zinoviev handed a Note yesterday [to the Turkish
Government] from the St. Petersburg Cabinet stating that about 400 Russian
seamen, after sinking a cruiser, had been

    

picked up the day before yesterday by an English merchant vessel bound for
Constantinople. The [Russian] Ambassador demanded of Turkey the detention of the
steamer during its passage through the Bosporus and the arrest and extradition
of the mutinous Russian seamen. That evening the Turkish Government called a
special meeting of the Council of Ministers which considered the Russian
request.... Turkey replied to the Russian Embassy that she was unable
to comply, since according to her international obligations Turkey had no right
to exercise police power on a steamer sailing under the English flag, even when
the steamer puts into a Turkish harbour. Besides, there existed no extradition
treaty between Russia and Turkey.”


Turkey replied “courageously”, the German newspaper comments on the
incident. The Turks refuse to do police duty for the tsar!


It is also reported that when the destroyer

 Stremitelny[1]

and several
other warships came to Constanla (Rumania) in pursuit of the Potemkin,
the Rumanian Government pointed out to the Russian authorities that in Rumanian
waters it was the Rumanian army and the Rumanian police that maintained order,
even if the Potemkin was still in Rumanian waters.


Thus, instead of the Potemkin creating trouble for foreign ships (as
the tsarist autocracy had predicted in order to frighten Europe), these ships
are plagued by a host of annoying incidents caused by the Russian fleet. The
English are indignant at the detention and search of their ship Granley
at Odessa. The Germans are incensed by reports that, at the request of the
Russians, the Turks will stop and search the German ship Pera on her
way to Constantinople from Odessa. Perhaps, under these circumstances, it will
not be so easy for Russia to secure European assistance against the Russian
revolutionaries. The question of rendering such assistance is being discussed by
a great many foreign papers, but in most cases they come to the conclusion that
it is not Europe’s business to help the tsar fight the Potemkin. The
Berliner Tageblatt publishes a report that the Russian

    

Government has even requested the powers to send their

war ships 

from
      Constantinople to Odessa to help restore order! How much truth there is in
      this statement (denied by certain other papers) the near future will
      show. But one thing is certain: with the Potemkin joining the
    uprising the first step has been taken towards converting the Russian
    revolution into an international force by bringing it face to face with the
    European states.


This fact should not be forgotten in appraising the telegraphic report of
M. Leroux to the Paris newspaper Le Matin from St. Petersburg
on July 4 (N.S.): “Throughout this [Potemkin] affair,” he writes,
“the lack of foresight on the part of the [Russian] authorities has been
astonishing; one cannot overstate the lack of organisation of the
revolution. The revolution gains possession of a battleship, an
event unique in
history, but it does not know what to do with it.”


There is, undeniably, a great deal of truth in this report. Without a doubt we
are to blame for not organising the revolution sufficiently. We are to blame
that certain Social-Democrats are but faintly conscious of the fact
that revolution must be organised, that the uprising must be included
among the urgent
practical problems, and that the necessity of a provisional revolutionary
government must be stressed in our propaganda. We revolutionaries deserve the
criticism now levelled at us by bourgeois writers for our poor organisation of
revolutionary functions.


But whether the armoured cruiser Potemkin deserves this reproach we do
not venture to say. Perhaps it was the deliberate aim of the crew to show
themselves in the harbour of a European power? Did not the Russian Government
keep all news of the events in the Black Sea Fleet from the people until the
Potemkin had freely entered the waters of Rumania? In Rumania the
revolutionary battleship delivered a proclamation to the consuls with a
declaration of war on the tsarist fleet and a statement to the effect that it
would commit no hostile acts against neutral ships. The Russian revolution
has declared to Europe that a state of open war exists between the Russian
people and tsarism. By doing so the Russian revolution has actually made an
attempt to speak in the name of a new, revolutionary government of

    

Russia. Undoubtedly, this is merely a first, feeble attempt, but, as the saying
goes, the first step is always the hardest.


According to the latest reports, the Potemkin has arrived at Feodosia,
demanding provisions and coal. The local population is in a turmoil. The workers
demand that the re quest of the revolutionary battleship be
granted. The Municipal Council decided to refuse coal, but to supply
provisions. The whole of
South Russia is agitated as never be fore. The number of victims of the civil
war in Odessa is estimated at 6,000. Telegraphic reports speak of the
shooting of 160 insurgents by court martial, and of an order from St. Petersburg
“to give no quarter!” But the troops are powerless; the troops
themselves are unreliable. In the factory suburbs of Odessa the turmoil has not
subsided. Last night (July 4-5, N.S.) thirty-five people were killed. By order
of the Governor-General, many of the troops have been withdrawn from the city
following the discovery of a serious lack of discipline among them. In
Nikolayev and Sevastopol disturbances arose in the government
arsenals. Thirteen people have been killed at Sevastopol. Peasant uprisings have
broken out in five uyezds of Kherson Gubernia. Nearly 700 peasants were
killed in the last four days. “A life-and-death struggle between the
people and the bureaucracy has apparently begun,” says a telegram from Odessa to
London dated July 5, N.S.


Yes, the real struggle for freedom, the life-and-death struggle, is only
beginning. The revolutionary armoured cruiser has not said its last word
yet. Long live the revolutionary army! Long live the revolutionary government!

Almost every day brings fresh evidence of this “bargaining”, to
which we have been directing the attention of the Russian proletarians for so
long a time. Here is an interesting telegram from M. Leroux dated
St. Petersburg, July 2 (new style): A meeting of municipal and Zemstvo
representatives held on June 28 and 29 (15 and 16, old style) once
more (for the
hundredth time!) formulated constitutional demands and telegraphed them to the
ministries. The demands are higher than usual: popular representation is made
an absolute condition, and is to be incorporated in the constitution;
the “Bulygin” Constitution is rejected outright; the demand is put
forth for the immediate proclamation of the inviolability of the person, freedom
of speech, etc. The conference is said to have unanimously adopted (but not
to have included in the

petition—in 

bargaining one must not show all
one’s cards!) the demand for universal suffrage.


How does the correspondent of the bourgeois paper judge this significant
increase in the demands of the landlords and manufacturers? Oh, his judgement is
a most sober one:


“It is obvious,” he writes, “that the delegates demand
more in order to get at least a little. But it is certain also that this little,
to be acceptable to them, must lie between that which they demand and that which
Bulygin is offering them.”


A veritable market, at which the bourgeoisie is bargaining away the rights and
interests of the Russian workers and the Russian peasants. As in a market, the
buyer—the bourgeoisie, and the seller—the tsar shake hands on the

    

bargain, shout for the hundredth time that this is their “last
word”, swear that they are “losing money”, threaten to go
away, but cannot bring themselves to break up their close friendship.


If the tsar does not meet our demands, “one of the most prominent members
of the [Zemstvo] conference” said to M. Leroux, “we will appeal to
the people”.


What is one to understand by this oft-repeated “appeal to the people”?
the French correspondent asks himself and his readers. And he answers: here
there is no Faubourg St. Antoine (the workers’ district in Paris; cf. the
article in Vperyod, No. 2[1]).

The people are inclined to keep off the
street and to stay at home, to protest in the Tolstoian manner by refusing to
pay taxes!...


Do not slander the people, you bourgeois betrayers of liberty! No
slander will ever cleanse the stain of your shameful cowardice. The people are
shedding their blood throughout Russia. Faubourgs St. Antoine of our own are
springing up in a number of towns and in countless villages. The people are
waging a desperate struggle. If you had really wanted to “appeal to the
people” (and not merely threaten your ally, the tsar, to do so) you should
not have assigned hundreds and thousands of rubles for your talking-shops, but
millions for the armed uprising. You should have elected a delegation, not to
cool its heels in the antechambers of the tsar, but to make contact with the
revolutionary

par ties, 

with the revolutionary people.


The tsar and his gang know only too well that you are incapable of doing so
because you are afraid for your money bags, because you are afraid of the
people. Therefore the tsar is entirely right in treating you as flunkeys; in
feeding you the same old promises, the same old Bulygin Constitution; in
assuming that you will not dare to make even a real, emphatic protest, not even
against that Bulygin sop. Small wonder that the special correspondent of the
Journal de Genève, a “respectable” liberal paper, wrote
recently: “The liberals do not conceal from themselves the imperfections
[!] of the Bulygin plan, but they think it should be accepted in the
interests of order and progress.... To reject the government’s
plan would mean deliberately to destroy the last hope for a peaceful outcome to
the present conflict between the
    

people and the bureaucratic regime." (The last sentence is underscored
    by the correspondent himself.)


The bourgeoisie wants peace with the tsar and fears the war of the
people against the tsar. The tsar wants peace with the bourgeoisie, but
does not fear the war with the people, which he has started and is ruthlessly
continuing. Is it not obvious that if the people fail to achieve complete
victory in spite of the treachery of the bourgeoisie, the inevitable
outcome of this situation will be the Bulygin Constitution?
